Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tantalizing Time
","OKAY, so I saw the most wonderful movie in a long time.  Kill Bill 2, as good as the first installment?  I haven't decided.  What I did get was a completely visual and audio experience which just blew me away.  Fantastic utilization of the locations, unbelievable use of light and architecture and enough Tarantino to make me laugh until I cried.  I was honestly afraid the people in the theater were going to throw me out but after I laughed loud enough, the rest of them decided it was Okay to laugh along.  I will go see this movie again and will definitely buy the dvd when it comes out.
My favorite part, Daryl Hannah.  I didn't realize what a hottie Uma was until the second installment.  I asked everyone I knew if those were really Uma's feet in the first installment because they did look quite nasty.  And there was a reference to Oak Ridge, Tennessee.   Thank you Tarantino.",10,0,1,21 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," No ending, welcome to Star Wars II
","I really, really, really don't like a movie without an ending which is why I never saw but two of the star war movies. I may actually go see the third one because I did not like the slime ball Johnny Depp character but I loved the creole witch/fortune teller. The ending was really neat but then again, there was no ending. And I was the idiot who went and saw this over the Devil wears Prada (which I guess I wasn't an idiot since this is the better movie). Outstanding special effects, wonderful story, but then again we are back to that no ending thing. I did watch KILL BILL I & II and they informed me quite nicely that I would have to wait for the second movie. But not this stinker. Hopefully Depp will come back as a rotten stinking tomato and have to be turned into tomato juice and then he can become the ghost of the Red Sea. Really great movie, except, no ending.",9,0,2,17 July 2006
Hostel," This is the one really mean movie you MUST watch!
","There are three movies in my lifetime that I have watched that captured the true meanness of the killer. They are 'Play Misty for Me', 'Dirty Harry' and 'Hostel'. All three movies do not give much leeway in the killers actions, they are killers, they kill. They may be nuts but let's not get lost in trying to figure out how to rehabilitate their sorry minds. Hostel is true from beginning to end, mean as hell. The beginning is a little slow of a setup but still, this is not supposed to be about Betty Crocker at the Pillsbury Bake-Off. This is a twisted variation of 'The Most Dangerous Game', and nothing is left to the imagination. The only difference is that this has a good ending. The hero does not end up enjoying killing and become the new Hostel owner (hope this is not the route of Hostel 2) but instead kills 4 of the people responsible for killing his two buddies. The best scene is where the hero runs over the three killers, and the black haired woman looks up from the ground after being run over, just in time to be run over by the automobile chasing the hero. I was like, 'Yeah', as if Iowa had just beat LSU on a last second toss at a football bowl game.Endings are the most critical ingredient of a great movie. This movie has it.Maybe Hostel 2 will be how he goes back and kills the management of the Hostel - or maybe the Asian friends of the two women murdered go back and slice the management up with Samuri swords.",9,3,5,31 May 2006
Billy Elliot," Fantastic movie, fantastic ending.
","Billy Elliot is a wonderful combination of dance, growing up, and family. Billy is confronted with little girls, little boys, and his desire to dance. His dancing blots out all the troubles of life.  The movie flows from one problem to the next and eventually everything works itself out.  This is a film that makes you want to scream to let this young boy dance, and then fight to let those dreams come true.  This movie does not screw you in the end with some kind of short change REALITY ending.  If I want REALITY I can call my parents on the telephone any day of the week.  But the movie does not sugar coat Billy's existence or the problems his family must face in coal mining country.  Wow, it's like real life, with a good ending.  This is the film to see.",10,0,0,9 April 2004
The Devil Wears Prada," Not much of a story
","This really is just about as much a chick flick as you can possibly come up with. The premise of the movie is good but then it just kind of becomes this Disneyish movie and nothing really awfully bad happens and the Devil in Meryl Streep is not much of a devil just a sorry boss who would fire you if you didn't kiss her rear in forty different places - not much different from any other overpaid, overpriced boss who thinks they do more than they ever could. I was hoping in the scene when the twins told her to come upstairs and give the mock up copy to Meryl, that the twins were going to draw mustaches on the book and all kinds of other stuff. But the movie is just there and doesn't really produce a pure devil. Ending is good, story is lacking, but the videography is superb, fantastic, wonderful. If this movie does anything, it makes everyone who watches it want to go to Paris or New York City. And of course the wonderful jewelry on Meryl is photographed very, very well.",7,0,0,17 July 2006
Bridget Jones's Diary," A Jolly Good Time
","Wonderful movie which effectively show cases how friends and family can interfere with one's love life.  A movie I could watch over and over.  I do not like Hugh Grant.  However, this movie works so very well that if this had been the first Hugh Grant movie I had seen, I would have watched the rest he was in.  The banter is wonderful and the ending is great.  Please, no more stinker endings for comedies.  This movie delivers as an entertaining comedy without any deep thinking.  The best part is that this was truly a comedy and not some twisted/dark comedy like Nurse Betty. Needless to say I will be buying this dvd, but not hardly the case for Nurse Betty.",10,0,0,5 May 2004
Mulholland Drive," Please Explain?
","So I watched Mulholland Dr. and I just sat there all night trying to figure out what I had just seen.  Did Mary Poppins go bad?  Who died, who lived, who wasn't really there?  I guess you could have about a billion conversations on this movie to decide what way it really went down.  Kind of put this one in the realm of Audition.  There were some scenes that made absolutely zero sense but I was told that was to be explained away in the tv series that never occurred.  Well, I guess I can just make up my own story and fight with all the other movie goers at what they actually saw.This is a nine out of ten for me because I had too many loose ends to tie up.",9,2,3,12 May 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," If you only knew, to watch another movie. (Spoilers)
","(Spoilers)I am friends with some serious movie buffs and let me tell you folks, Blue Velvet is not as bad or weired as portrayed by those wonderful movie reviewers, but Eyes Wide Shut is worse than anything a movie reviewer could dream up.  Keep your eyes pretty much closed and wonder, did I just see a bunch of skin and wish I had seen at least a soft porn film instead of this? Keep your eyes shut and you won't have to wonder how a supposedly so smart doctor would not even give a hoot about the piano player.  You won't have to wonder how stupid the doctor's wife is for saying she would have taken a roll in the hay and given up her life for a stranger.  You will see some incredible nude women.  Women that are drop dead gorgeous specimens.  You will see the doctor play with a woman without showing anything of her body and make it look like she is ready to bed him right then and there.  But then you have a dead hooker and the missing piano player and nobody who gives a hoot?  Please don't let the doctor be my friend.  And if I only knew, well I tell you I have a lot of friends who say they will sleep with Bill Clinton but not too many who will run off with the first man in uniform.  That's what I know.",3,0,2,8 July 2004
Jackie Brown," A middle of the road movie
","I remember seeing the promos on television for Jackie and thinking, wow, what a great retro type show.  A big plan to heist a bunch of money with a lot of big name actors.  But the show eventually loses the feel that is generated in all the promos.  The ending just left me setting there going, that's it?  That is the end?  This is no KILL BILL which is just a great movie, this is just one of those, oh, I saw that, and I wish it had been a whole lot better.  A friend told me that the hype of the movie destroyed it because of the success of Pulp Fiction.  Well, I have to say that this movie had some classic scenes of dark humor, but the ending was just another one of those, we don't know how to end it, so here ya go.5/10",5,3,7,19 May 2004
