Vertigo," Great color, effects, but dumb
","Perhaps Hitch got carried away with the effects he was using. This picture, the restored edition, has some quite wonderful shots and great color and some special effects that showed up again in the psychedelic 60s. Good fun. But the plot is trite and Kim Novak goes over the top more than once. It felt 'dumb.' Was it the times, or have movies advanced?",5,7,17,2 July 2002
Spartacus," Ho hum
","Acting this wooden deserves some laughter! Even Olivier fell into the trap, though he mostly avoided it. This stuff was just pap for an audience that the producers held in contempt. A picture this bad wouldn't get much serious coverage today ... though Brave Heart did, so ... There was some very interesting cinematography, in setting up the battle scenes with the Legions, but on the whole, this picture was a waste of time, I thought. It was an early example of Kubrick's work, which has left me quite unmoved, quite amazed that he was considered a significant director. To me, his stuff is over the top and simplistic and this film is representative.",4,8,19,6 July 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Not what I once thought
","I used to consider this a great film. Now, I think it a triumph of technology, but its just a period piece.  There are just too many flaws (like the really bad cuts in the opening sunrise sequence) to call it great. The characters are unbelievably flat, the dialogue is no better than trite and the incredible adventure being shown on the screen elicits nothing more than controlled comment from robots. These are the same generation of astronauts, remember, who managed their way through Apollo 13.  Comparing the characters offered by the screenwriters makes painfully obvious how much of a cartoon we were offered in 2001. I'm sure the film hasn't changed, but I have. But what it might look like with some modern effects and plausible character development is something we'll never enjoy. Sad.",7,2,5,28 April 2002
The Legend of 1900," An unexpected treat.
","I nearly abandoned viewing this picture. The early scenes felt artificial and forced, the story seemed disjointed and a bit strange.But I stayed with it and I am very glad that I did. The picture is 'movie impressionsim,' I think, where linear thinking really doesn't matter very much. The culminating philosophical perspective is refreshingly different and worth waiting for. This is a very beautiful film to view and the characters grew to be special people for me. The music was fabulous. Highly recommended.",8,1,3,31 August 2001
Gangs of New York," Dreadful melodrama
","The most vehement anti-American film I have ever seen. Everything is dark, corrupt, without any redeeming feature. Bad film. The acting is better, but the effect of humans trying to play cartoons (not characters) is difficult to absorb.",3,2,6,13 March 2003
