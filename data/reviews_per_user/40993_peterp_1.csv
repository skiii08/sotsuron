The Blair Witch Project," Good idea, poor execution
","I think the concept or idea of the Blair Witch Project is a good one, but sadly the film doesn't deliver. May be it is because the immense hype that surrounded the film was not matched by the quality of the film. The mark of any good film is in it's ability to suspend your disbelief (in the fact that it's a film). This film failed on that score. It was just too unbelievable for too many reasons. Now don't get me wrong, films of that genre are often truly unbelievable, but they don't attempt to be believable films as BWP does. If you are going to set yourself up as a reality film and use it to suspend people's disbelief, you better do a good job. This doesn't.",Null,0,1,15 August 2001
