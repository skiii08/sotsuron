The King's Speech," Fine film with only the slightest whiff of the waxworks.
","Judging from few of the reviews, some viewers of this excellent film have appeared to let their anti-monarchical sentiments get the better of them. I will say at the onset that Iam a bit of an Anglophile, and that while Iam hardly an apologist for the British monarchy( I really don't give a darn about Bill and Kates nuptials, and I pity Rowan Williams for having to explain the sacrament of marriage to them.), I also find most of the trendy knee-jerk criticism of the monarchy boring. Having said that, I found this a profoundly moving,well acted, richly detailed film. It was not a startlingly innovative example of cinematic art, and it had few deep insights into the human condition. The greatest strength of the film was its wonderful acting. Colin Firth was superb as an well-meaning but emotionally crippled, limited, man thrust into the tragicomic status of a monarch.Geoffrey Rush was very good as his therapist, both a healer and a frustrated actor.The always underrated Guy Pearce captured the flippancy, decadence, nd essential nihilism of Edward the seventh. Helena Bonham Carter was excellent as the devoted wife. There were moments of stiffness and 'historical pageant' in some of's the supporting roles.( Hey there's Churchill! There's Chamberlain! There's Baldwin!') But this didn't feel all too much like an extended episode of Masterpiece Theater.",9,1,2,8 April 2011
Requiem for a Dream," The saddest film ever made...
","This is an extraordinary film. When I saw it ,all I could do at the end was to say a Hail Mary..It is, unquestionably the most depressing, and the most brutal film ever put on the Screen...it makes Tokyo Story seem like a laugh riot.Ellen Burstyns performance is astonishingly poignant in its vulnerability..All the other leads are also terrific.",Null,1,2,25 March 2003
Se7en," Brilliant, horrifying nihilism.
","Let me say at the outset that I am not a great admirer of David Fincher as a director. Alien3 was far too dreary and bleak, while The Game seemed to be a hollow,if stylish, exercise in manipulation. Having said that, I must register my admiration for Se7en. It was both absolutely terrifying and  thought -provoking. The cinematography, the acting,and script were all superb. Morgan Freeman is indeed one of the world's greatest actors, while Brad Pitt does a great job  as the slow-witted, dogged, arrogant young cop. (Perhaps because his own personality in real life is so similar.) However, the revelation is the performance by the actor playing 'John Doe' . I will not give his name, as that would help give away the plot Having sung se7ens praises, why do I call it 'nihilistic'? For one thing, the overall tone of the film is one of dread and despair. But much more importantly, Se7en boasts one of the most terrifying endings of any film I have ever seen. It makes the ending of Chinatown seem like the ending of It's a Wonderful Life.",9,0,0,20 April 1999
The Mummy," Campy, larky fun.
","I am truly amazed by the solemnity of some of the attacks on this film. Did anyone notice that it was not intended as a SERIOUS film, but as campy, adventurous fun, with spectacular sets, thunderous battle scenes,sensational special effects, hammy ( but far from wooden),acting, a truly over-the top villain, a plucky heroine, and a bargain-basement Indiana Jones-style hero? Sure it is full of preposterous sequences..what do you want?The Leopard? Lawrence of Arabia? Relax and enjoy this film!",9,0,0,21 June 1999
The Natural," Marvelous, mythic extravaganza.
","Yes, the film does give Bernard Malamuds dark, haunting, parable a happy ending. However, this is the only fault in this beautiful, mythic, magical allegory. The cinematography and the score exceed distinction; they are simply  beautiful. The performances are uniformly good, with not a single false note, from Barbara Hershey 'Seagulls' mysterious mad woman, to the sublime Richard Farnsworth, to the great Darren McGavin.Redford doesnt have to act: he simply IS. Interestingly, I first saw this film in a course on Medieval history!As the teacher of the course pointed out, the whole film mirrors the mythic structure of medieval quest literature. It is a delight for ANYONE who love baseball, and anyone who thrills to the power and mystery of the great myths.",9,1,2,11 April 2000
Chicken Run," Chickens of the henhouse, unite!
","Let me say at the outset that 1. I am not a vegetarian, and 2. I usually prefer films with human actors to animation. Having made these two caveats, let me say without equivocation that Chicken Run is a very funny, quite touching film.Ginger may be the greatest cinematic heroine since Bess in Breaking The Waves. She has pluck(clever pun), grit, and determination. In fact, this chicken sure isn't . OK, now that I've recovered from my little attack of 'shalitis' ,( An obsessive compulsive 'punning disorder'which often afflicts would-be 'clever critics' )I will say that I have nothing bad to say about this film. A true Movie buff will appreciate the dozens of references, both subtle and obvious, to past films. Not just the Great Escape or Stalag17, but Braveheart, Flight of The Phoenix, and Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, are delightfully parodied-and thats just the beginning.In short, I loved this movie..despite its rather obvious Marxism..just kidding.",10,0,0,8 July 2000
The Hustler," Superb film by a great director.
","Because of his tragically erratic, often interrupted career, Robert Rossen is rarely put into the pantheon of great Hollywood directors. However, he produced three films which deserve  a permanent place  among the classics, All the Kings Men( probably the best film about American politics), Lilith( one of the greatest films about mental illness) and this, a movie which DESERVES to be ranked with the hundred greatest, and possibly the fifty greatest, American films. It is superbly acted, brilliantly photographed and edited, and directed with clarity and assurance. In a just world ( if there is such a place), an special Oscar would have been bestowed on Newman, Laurie, Scott, and Gleason AS A GROUP. Piper Laurie was unforgettably poignant, Scott unforgettably sleazy, and Gleason... well, Gleason simply IS Minnesota Fats. Paul Newman almost certainly deserved the Oscar.It was  an amusing irony, perhaps a little joke by God, that the bartender in the movie was played by none other than Jake LaMotta.",10,57,79,4 May 1999
L.A. Confidential," Slightly flawed, but still a film for the ages.
","People have compared this film to Chinatown. That's not quite right. After viewing Chinatown, one couldn't sleep for nights. Evil triumphed, and it did so in an absolutely terrifying way. Here the 'good guys' won a very ambiguous victory, though at a terrible price. ( It should be noted that In Ellroy's masterpiece, the 'victory' is even more ambiguous, and the price Ed Exley pays is much, much greater.)Still, this film is magnificent..there are lines in this movie that will be remembered as long as people watch movies. The wonderful montage sequence ( accompanied by Kay Starr's 'Wheel of Fortune'), and the opening narrated by Devito are superb.Finally, this will be remembered for its acting. What other recent film has unveiled not one , but TWO future superstars, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe? Have James Cromwell and Kevin Spacey EVER been better? Everybody else-including Basinger and the usually irritating DeVito-was simply smashing. It wasn't Ellroy's novel, to be sure, but to capture all of Ellroy's book would take a film the length of the Russian version of war and Peace, or Gances Napoleon.",10,1,2,15 April 1999
Taxi Driver," Surreal, searing, descent into hell.
","A Catholic priest named Joseph Pirrone, who is an old friend and former teacher of Scorsese, complained that the biggest problem with Marty's movies was 'too much easter Friday, not enough Easter Sunday.' Indeed, with the obvious exception of Alice Hyatt , and the possible exceptions of Newland Archer and fast Eddie Felsom,very few of Marty's characters experience real happiness, or earthly salvation.The most  that most them do is to survive ( Though we are to assume that one of them IS resurrected). So far, most of Scorsese's film have been tours of the circles of Dante's hell. ( He has said that this will change in the future.) One of his most harrowing tours of the Inferno is Taxi Driver.I first saw this horrific masterpiece on the big screen ten years ago.It remains burnt into my memory. Let me just note two things about the film that seem to have escaped the attention of many viewers. The first is how much black, sardonic humor there is . Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle are genuinely AMUSING. The second is how romantic it is. I dont mean romantic in in the 'Harlequin romance' sense, I mean 'romantic' in the Hawthorne/Melville sense. Like Ahab or Ethan Brand, Travis Bickle is a dark protagonist in a tale that  SEEMS realistic, but which is actually  surrealistic, fantastic, and just plain strange. Like them is he is on a dark, obsessive, demonic quest. After all, how much of what we see is really there, and how much  exists only in Travis' Fantasy world? in short, there is more here than meets the eye--much more. Perhaps David Lynch had a point when he said ' Kubrick is the coolest ( director),and Marty is next door.' An intelligent film critic could write a great essay on the bizarre spiritual -and stylistic-affinities between the surrealist/boy scout from Missoula and the gangster/priest from New York. They have more in common than Isabella Rossellini.",10,0,0,15 April 1999
Barry Lyndon," Superb exploration of the Human Condition
","This is not simply a 'costume drama', it is an allegory-at  once darkly comic and profoundly moving- about the human condition. Barry Lyndon is an everyman attempting  to make his way in  the world, who is ultimately undone by his own pride, vanity, and folly. In the films supreme final irony, the very act which spiritually redeems him leads to  his final worldly defeat. He has the chance to finally destroy Lord Bullingdon, but he will not violate the gentleman's code.Bullingdon, however, has no such compunctions. This film is utterly magnificent. All of the minor characters are as vivid as the minor characters in Dickens. The lighting, the music, and the stately pace of the film , are perfect. The Film contains scenes which rank with the greatest in cinematic history: the robbery, the battles, the death of Barry's child, and, then, finally, the terrific duel, one of the most thrilling ever put on the screen. Those who called this film 'boring' should hand in their memberships in the Screen critics guild-or get seeing eye Dogs.",10,2,3,28 April 2000
Hugo," A Ribbon of Dreams
","There are only seven or eight American directors now working who can be called true artists, visionary auteur's with a signature. They are Paul Thomas Anderson, Terrence Malick,Clint Eastwood, The Coen Brothers( who I treat at a single directorial intelligence), David Lynch, Steven Spielberg(despite his flaws), maybe Spike Jonze, and above all, Martin Scorsese. Martin has done four classic gangster movies, a (flawed) musical, documentaries, a brilliant, under-rated costume drama, two startling religious epics, two brilliant biopics about gifted, tormented men, a Hitchcockian thriller, and two superb black comedies, one of which ( After Hours) almost out-Lynches Lynch.). Admittedly, He has not yet done a War Movie or a Western. ( Though I would not count out either as possibilities.) Another genre he has not touched is the children's film. He has made two PG rated films, The Age Of Innocence and Kundun, but neither could be called a kids film. Now, Scorsese has made a children's film. Even more incredibly, he has made a 3-d children's film that is also a period film, and he has hit the ball out of the park. As a cinematic achievement- indeed,as a sheer feat of human imagination, Hugo can only be called superb. This film is an beautifully designed, shot and edited tribute to the innocence and imagination of childhood, AND a heart-felt love letter to the movies. Touching, funny and extraordinarily inspiring and redemptive, this is a masterpiece from a director who can only be called a god of the cinema. I will never forget Hugo.",10,6,12,26 November 2011
Judgment at Nuremberg," An extremely powerful, if slightly 'preachy'film.
","Stanley Kramer was a good, if often over-emphatic director of 'message'movies. this, is,undoubtedly, his finest effort.The title, Judgement At Nuremberg, might lead a naive viewer to think that it was about the Nuremburg trial of the major Nazi war criminals. Instead, he focuses on a lesser known, but historically-and philosophically even more interesting trial, the trial of the Nazi JUDGES.How was it that German judges-some of whom were, cultured, liberal, sensitive men, like the Burt Lancaster character-became collaborators with the Nazi regime? this film features fantastic performances by Tracy, Lancaster, Schell, Dietrich, Widmark, Clift, and even Judy Garland. This is an interesting film, because it is a film about Moral and political dilemmas. Each of the major characters faces a moral choice. Lancaster was a liberal Wiemar intellectual/Judge, who thought he could 'work with' the Nazis, and became corrupted by them. Dietrich plays the widow of a German general, who claims to have been a 'good' German. Tracy plays an American judge, who is under political pressure to go easy on the Judges, and who is also fascinated by the Dietrich character. Widmark is the American prosecutor, a military officer who is under pressure from his superiors to 'let up' in prosecuting the Germans( the cold war is getting underway,and the American high command does not want to antagonize a potential ally.).The most complex-and fascinating-character is played by Maximilian Schell,as Lancaster's brilliant, sometimes frighteningly. convincing, defense attorney. Clift and Garland play two victims of the Nazi 'legal system'. Underlying the whole narrative are two profound philosophical questions. 1.Is the law merely a set of commands by the sovereign, or should it reflect moral imperatives? 2. Why do liberal societies-like Weimar Germany-succumb to totalitarianism? In short, a very powerful, interesting film. I should add one comment in response to a previous reviewer.Let me say that even though I am a conservative-and a reluctant Bush voter-I am highly critical of many aspects of the current administrations policies.Still, to draw some sort of facile parallel between The Bush administration and the Hitler regime is more than an exercise in poor taste, it is absurd. Bush has many, many faults but he is no Nazi. The People who constantly make facile comparisons between modern America and the third Reich are utterly irresponsible.",9,2,3,27 April 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Pure cinematic magic and genius.
","In this commentators opinion, there are a handful of films that transcend the 'ten ' ranking and reach a supreme level of art-Citizen Kane, Touch Of Evil, Andrei Roublev, El Gattopardo, Barry Lyndon, Raging Bull, the first two Godfathers, Pickpocket, The Red Shoes, The Searchers, Vertigo, Les Infants du Paradis, Les Regles de Jeu, Otto e Mezzo, Trois Coleurs:Rouge, Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, The Life Of Colonel Blimp, L'Atalante, Singin in The Rain, Lawrence of Arabia, Rio Bravo, Bringing Up Baby, Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai, Tthe Third Man, Joan of Arc at The Stake, Sunrise, and perhaps a dozen more.Now, this film has joined their august company.If the Academy award selectors have taste and intelligence, ( That was meant as a JOKE)this film should  rout the competition at Oscar time..the only film that comes even within shouting distance of it is Gladiator. Everything about this film was superb- the costumes, the cinematography, the acting, and the exciting, well-told story. This was a genuine, magical epic, -the kind Hollywood virtually forgot how to make YEARS ago. As with the really great films, it is full of exquisite, painterly scenes, that remain in the memory. Bravo Ang Lee!",10,1,1,17 February 2001
The Elephant Man," Ones of the most heart rending films of all time.
","It is truly baffling to me that there are people who have seen this film  who still think that David Lynch is a cold and cruel film-maker. David Lynch is ,in fact, a man of extraordinary gentleness and sensitivity, who cares deeply about the sort of people whom mainstream society stigmatizes as 'freaks'.Please, watch this film--watch it carefully-- and you will see that Lynch's deepest concern is with how a over-industrialized, rigid, and profoundly hypocritical society crushes its outsiders. It may sound odd, but I really believe that the non-Christian Lynch has, in the person of John Merrick portrayed one of the most profoundly moving 'Christ figures' in all of film.  Let me also note how well Lynch( In only his second effort at directing!) handled such legends as Hiller, Gielgud and Hopkins.",10,11,11,14 April 1999
The Greatest Game Ever Played," The greatest game of GOLF ever played.
","When i first heard the title of this film, I thought it was about either: 1. Centre's Upset of Harvard in 1920. 2. The 1958 NFL Championship. 3. The last game of the 1960 World Series, 0r (a tie) Texas Vs. Arkansas, 1969 2.The sixth Game between Boston and Cincinnati in 1976 or 3. The 'confrontation', Southern Cal versus UCLA, 1967. As You may have guessed, I prefer Football and baseball to golf. Having said that, and having seen this movie, I will say that this probably the best golf movie ever, and that the game it tells about WAS the greatest game of golf, ever. It was the greatest, not simply because an unknown 19 year old amateur, Francis Ouimet upset one of the greatest golfers who ever lived, Harry Vardon, (And another very fine golfer, Ted Ray as well), but because it marked a turning point in the history of golf in America, helping to make the game popular among all Americans. However, The greatest books about Sports- Beyond A Boundary, Friday Night Lights,, When The Colts Belonged to Baltimore, The Boys Of summer, and a few others, explore the social, ethical and spiritual context of sport, and so do the best movies about sports. This Is a great sports movie based on a great sports book, and it has both a socio - economic and an ethical subtext. The socio-economic context in the book and the film is CLASS , and class conflict.Golf began as a game for aristocrats. In the very first scene, aristocrats confiscate the young Harry Vardon's family farm to build a golf course. Twenty years later, the humbly born Vardon is the greatest golfer in the world. Vardon is a self-made gentleman who infuriates the British golf establishment by picking the uncouth Ted Ray as his co-representative for Great Britain at the !919US Golf Championship. Ouimet himself is an social outsider, a working-class youth who stuns the US golf establishment by his superb play, which culminates in a three way playoff who determine the championship. Ouimets eventual upset win created an international sensation, In addition, the book and the film have a moral context as well. They both celebrate the virtues of true sportsmanship; courage, loyalty, perseverance, and hard work. They also show that true aristocracy is a matter of merit, not birth. The humbly born Vardon and Ouimet- even the Falstaff-like Ted Ray, possess more truly aristocratic qualities than the aristocrats of the gold establishment.On top of all that, this is a well-acted, expertly directed, and superbly edited and shot film. In short, this is the best sports films, ever.",Null,0,2,19 August 2012
Mission: Impossible," Mission: Incomprehensible!
","Aside from a fairly good performance by Vanessa Redgrave, and a really good performance by Ving Rhames, this is not a great film. Yes, I know, Cahiers de Cinema listed it among the ten best films of the nineties...perhaps they thought its self-deconstructing plot and unsympathetic characters were somehow 'postmodern', perhaps it's the same French auteurism that  elevates Mans Favorite Sport to 'Masterpiece' status simply because it was directed by Hawks( Dont get me wrong, it is a very smooth piece of professional cinema by Hawks, it's just  not Bringing Up Baby or Rio Bravo). The syllogism is a simple one ( for a French critic) Mission: Impossible is a Brian DePalma film ( Incontrovertible premise) , Brian DePalma is a genius ( questionable middle term of syllogism),THEREFORE< Mission: Impossible is a masterpiece.( logically valid, but far from true, conclusion). Lets hope Woo can do better...",6,2,4,29 February 2000
Pulp Fiction," An intensely spiritual-and moral - film.
","Pulp Fiction may be one of the most profoundly misunderstood films of our time. One critic even called  it a 'glorification of two whacked out hit-men'.Others called it 'flippant', 'nihilistic' and 'cynical'. Yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such 'worthless' characters. Yet others called it 'plotless' and 'formless'. However, a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that , like most of the 'pulp fiction ' on which it is based, it is indeed profoundly moral. Even more, Tarantinos film earnestly grapples with SPIRITUAL issues. Tarantino has carefully studied the films of Dreyer and Bresson, as well as those of Don Spiegel and Phil Karlson.To make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film, I will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three  episodes. Each one ends with a human life or lives being saved. Yes , there is cynicism, flippancy and studied 'coolness' in Pulp Fiction. However, this is merely the glossy packaging in which Tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message. This is a film about redemption.",10,0,0,29 April 1999
Crazy Heart," Superb, understated, performances and terrific songs
","This is one of the handful of first-rate, intelligent, films about Country Music,and a great film about music-and art- in general. It is based on an unfortunately obscure, but excellent, novel by Thomas Cobb. When I lived in Charlottesville, VA, there was even a pretty good Country and Western Duo that called itself 'crazy heart' after the book. Now, almost twenty years after, A film has been made of the book..and what a film! Scott Ccoper's direction is excellent, and captures the spirit of the music and the world that gives birth to it. Jeff Bridges gives the performance of his career, capturing Bad Blakes guilt, his tenderness, his struggle with his demons, and his talent-a talent close to genius. Maggie Gylenhall is also terrific. This is a well acted, well written, superbly scored film, with nary a single false note. This movie comes very close to art, and Jeff Bridges performance is a work of art in itself.",9,1,2,15 June 2010
There Will Be Blood," A film of extraordinary power and richness.
","There are a few great American films about the self-destructive pathology of power and obsession: The Godfather ( first two parts.), Citizen Kane,The Searchers Rossen'sAll The Kings Men. Like The greatest films of Griffith, Welles, Kubrick, Scorsese, and Malick this film constitutes a stunning breakthrough in film grammar and film technique. By deliberately eschewing dialogue at key moments, Anderson creates an almost unbearable tension. The score is brilliant, the editing comparable to Schonmakers best work for Scorsese, the art direction by Jack Fisk absolutely superb. Daniel Day-Lewis performance is amazingly rich and nuanced, fully equal to his startling work for Scorsese in the under-rated and misunderstood The Age of Innocence and his soul-shattering turn as Bill the Butcher Cutting in Gangs of New York. All of the other performances are good, and Paul Dano is as brilliant in his way as Daniel Day-Lewis. This, in short, is one of those rare and wonderful films which actually merits an 'Eleven', up there with The Rules of The Game, The Leopard, Badlands, the first Two Godfathers, Seven Samurai, Eight and a Half, Raging Bull, The Red Shoes, the Searchers, Stagecoach, Shadow of A Doubt, Notorious, Vertigo, Barry Lyndon, The Age of Innocence, The Tree of Life, Tokyo Story,Touch Of Evil, Grand Illusion, The Earrings of Madame De_, Intolerance, The General, Sunrise, Faust, Diary Of A Country Priest, Modern Times, Casablanca, Sullivan's Travels, and perhaps a few others.",10,2,4,22 November 2011
Paths of Glory," More than an anti-war film.
","There are only two film-makers who never made a bad film in their careers:Andrei Tarkovsky and Stanley Kubrick.Even though Kubrick's mastery of the film medium was evident as early as Killers Kiss, and maybe even as early as Day of the Fight, his genius was confirmed by this, his second major feature.Some critics even suggest that  Paths  Of Glory was Kubrick's BEST film, and that his subsequent career was one of decline. It would be more precise to argue that Paths of Glory was the film which showed Kubricks complete mastery of TRADITIONAL film grammar and techniques, as first' exemplified by Griffith and Pudovkin, while his later films show him EXPERIMENTING with those techniques,challenging established ideas of narration and characterization. In addition, Paths of Glory is-on the surface- a more 'didactic' and 'humanistic' film than his later works. He seems to be delivering a conventional 'liberal' message; 'war is hell', 'men should not be inhumane to man',etc.While Kubrick is indeed a liberal humanist who  looks askance at the military, his film is not simply a pacifist sermon.Kubrick is, instead offering  a close analysis of the meaning of courage , loyalty, and honor. These virtues, so often extolled by 'conservatives' are NOT mocked by Kubrick. Instead he is criticizing the MISUSE of these virtues by 'scoundrels' such as the military brass hats.The true hero of paths of glory is NOT the well-meaning but tragically ineffectual liberal 'hero', Colonel Dax (superbly played by Kirk Douglas), instead the hero is a GROUP of people, the ordinary, suffering 'grunts' of the 'poor bloody  infantry', who, in the films unforgettable closing scene, hum along with a frightened German  girl as she sings a love song in her native language.",10,1,1,3 May 1999
Raging Bull," Misunderstood masterpiece.
","Martin Scorsese is on record as saying that he has not yet made a truly great film, something up to the standard of The Searchers, Citizen Kane, Eight and a Half, The Leopard, or The Red Shoes. Perhaps he's right. However, he can boast of at least one film that comes awfully close to that olympian standard, Raging Bull. When Scorsese made Raging Bull, he was seriously thinking of it as a terminal work. He was going to end his career in Hollywood, move to Italy, and make documentaries about the lives of the saints. For better or worse,He chose not to. Still, retirement WAS seriously on his mind, and because of that, Scorsese poured all his thoughts, all his feelings, all of his knowledge of cinema into this, one of the most troubling- and unforgettable films- ever made. I believe that I have seen Raging Bull nearly a dozen times, and I see new meanings and surprising nuances in it every time. Here I can offer only a few comments, both of which are paradoxical. The first is that Raging Bull is a very violent film about love; the second is that it succeeds in portraying Jake Lamotta because it is just as much about Marty Scorsese as it is about Jake LaMotta. There are  five love stories in Raging Bull. The first is the story of Joey Lamottas love for his dull-witted, stubborn, hot-tempered , 'crazy ' brother. The second is Vicky Lamottas equally passionate love for her brutish, insanely jealous husband.The third is the story of Jakes love of himself, which begins as a brutish, jealous, self-loathing, profoundly selfish love, and slowly and in a halting, confused way, becomes a very different self appraisal, the recognition that he is not an ANIMAL, but a man. The Fourth love is that of Marty Scorsese himself, both for the film medium  and for the characters in his best films. The fifth may sound crazy, but I think it is present throughout the film. It is the love of God.It would take a lot more space than I have here, but  I would assert that Raging Bull DOES NOT portray a world in which God is absent; God even loves someone as brutish, as short-sighted, as vulgar and as morally obtuse as Jake. Indeed , Scorsese has even claimed that Jake comes close to God without realizing it. My second claim is that Raging Bull is autobiographical. But, in a sense, almost all of Scorsese's films are, whether directly or indirectly. For me , Raging Bull is autobiographical in that Marty is, to a large extent, reflecting himself in Jake. Scorsese, the 'gangster-priest' is confessing his sins and exorcising his demons. In this way, he is inviting all of his viewers to undertake a similar act of self examination, confession, and exorcism. This is one ( but not the only one) of the reasons that Raging Bull ends with a quote from Johns Gospel and a dedication to Haig Manoogian, who taught Marty how to look into himself and see.",10,2,2,24 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," Far more than a horror film
","There are two kinds of great genre film. The first is the sort that exemplifies the conventions of the genre, while respecting the genre's limits. The second kind of genre film uses the rhetoric and archetypes of the genre to film to point beyond the limits of genre, to attain the level of the symbolic, the ethical and the spiritual.Thus , in the film Noir genre,Kiss Me Deadly is a brilliant example of the first kind of good genre film, while Touch of Evil is a brilliant example of the second. The greatness of The Sixth Sense-and I firmly believe that it is one of the handful of films from last year that can be classified as truly great-lies precisely in how it transcends its genre.The Sixth Sense resonates with Hawthornesque tonalities. It echoes Melville, Poe and Henry James ( I refer to James' great ghost stories, not his often tedious 'novels of manners').The critics who saw only only a creepy, dull story with a twist at the end missed entirely the films extraordinary religious symbolism. The Bruce Willis Character is a soul in limbo, waiting to be saved. The instrument of salvation? A frightened, yet preternaturally gifted, child.Not a single performance in the film hit a false note..this is an extraordinary film about parents and children, about husbands and wives, and about life and death. The score, the cinematography, and the script were uniformly excellent. I i especially liked the filmmakers' brilliant use of the Philadelphia locale, and the way in which the cities dark history was alluded to. In short, a wonderful film and an exhilarating religious experience-SUPERB",10,0,0,3 March 2000
Casino," a stunning epic
","It usually takes a decade or more for people to wise up to to a Scorsese film, and notice how brilliant it really is...just witness all the sneering comments being made about Gangs and Aviator. When Casino came out, its only high profile defender was Ebert. Most of the other critics, and not just the usual suspects( such as a certain hack whose initials are M.M).thought it was just an knock off of Goodfellas. This is , to put it bluntly, absurd. This film is one of the three or four greatest organized crime epics.The texture, the rhythm, the pace, the color, and the horror of Las Vegas are captured with bold brush strokes.The costumes, the music, the editing, the cinematography..all are brilliant. I will comment on the acting... Robert De Niro portrays someone hes never portrayed before in a Scorsese film..a cool headed, calculating near genius.His Achilles heel is his pride in his intelligence. He cannot imagine that he can make a mistake, and it leads to his fall. Joe Pesci offers a better performance than in Goodfelllas, because his character has more screen time and is far more complex. Yes..he is a violent, destructive man. He also imagines himself to be extremely loyal, a good family man, etc. Note how reluctant he is to torture the guy using the vise..its just that he knows that if he doesn't, HIS head will be in the vise.Note the weird grace notes , like combing the hair of the woman he shoots. Finally, Sharon Stone.This is a woman who who is pitifully weak and confused, for all her outward bravado. James Woods (a stunning portrayal) plays her like a Stradivarius.). The last shot of Ms. Stone in the movie(I will not give it away)is terrifying-and pitiful. every performance in this movie,from the biggest star turn to the smallest cameo,is dazzling..the use of Stardust at the end is brilliant. This is a fabulous film, which will-eventually be seen as a great one.",10,0,0,21 May 2005
Braveheart," An epic in the great tradition
","Yes, Mel does occasionally call attention to his own genius with the use of slow motion. Yes, the script is occasionally over-the top( What DOES 'they fought like warrior poets' MEAN?)Yes there are historical inaccuracies-so what? Does anybody think this movie is a history lesson? Altogether, this film is an enormous, extravagant epic, a sort of Celtic El Cid.Also, the film is just full of colorful characters, stirring dialogue, very good battle scenes( Gibson obviously studied Chimes at Midnight)and genuine 'sweep'. One last thing..all, and I mean ALL ,of the performances are SUPERB. I found Angus McFadyens Bruce to be especially moving. In a sense, the film is about his moral and political education( another echo  of Chimes at Midnight). In short, a magnificent film..I would give it a 9.65.",9,2,3,25 March 2000
