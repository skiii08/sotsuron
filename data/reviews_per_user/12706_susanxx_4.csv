The Ring," great idea, shame about the end
","What starts off as a promising thriller, disintegrates into a complete puzzle.  The leads are as charismatic as dung beetles and the jerky cinematography leaves you with a headache.  You can just about manage to keep up with the story when the end credits roll and you are left wondering what you missed.  Serious drosh, avoid unless very, very desperate.",5,1,2,21 January 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Ahoy Hokum
","One for the kids as this is certainly not adult fodder.  The special effects are excellent, the story is weak and Johnny Depps accent is something to ponder over.  Seriously overlong in running time even the kids would get bored before too long.",6,1,2,21 January 2004
Cast Away," how time flies!
","Basic, boy loves girl, boy goes to work and doesn't return for some time story. Tom Hanks plays it as only he can, but believing in what he does is difficult.  To the viewer, not having an update as to the time he has been on the island ( just a note along the bottom of the screen) one is left wondering how he is managing but as he doesn't seem to lose any weight you feel he's only been there a matter of a few weeks.  Plus as he like things to be precise and seems to be a person who investigates and references things he is remarkably stupid on some basic  survival techniques.  Overly long and the end leaves you wondering, 'what now?'",4,0,5,1 September 2002
U-571," not your average war film
","If you don't like war films, watch this. Its not your average war film and is full of action from start to finish. There is plenty of action, excitement and suspense with the added thrill of confinement and claustrophobia.  You really can feel what it must have been like to be depth charged.  Settle down and watch a great film.",Null,0,2,23 August 2002
