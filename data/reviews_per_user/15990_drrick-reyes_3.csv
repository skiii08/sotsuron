First Man," Mixed emotions...
","Ok... Apollo 13 was great let's not compare these two movies. But this was about the what most of us didn't know part about the Apollo 11 mission. How Armstrong was in private. Boring some say? Well if that was his personality, they are not going to show Armstrong like Freddy Mercury right? Let's say it was interesting to learn those not so mainstream part of this mission.",6,1,2,14 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The die hard fans will always be disappointed
","...Like they want to be surprised like in the first Star Wars. Like seriously, what do you want? You've seen all sorts of droids, aliens already... You want what? New types of troopers? You had it too! Flying troopers...
The story? You don't really go watch Star wars for the story... You want to watch the lightsabers, the X wings, falcon millenium...Just enjoy this one... Stop complaining.",7,0,2,27 December 2019
Bird Box," Entertaining...
","Of course there are people who are always expecting that every movie they are going to watch is OSCAR material. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Goodluck to that, you'd be dissapointed most of the time...Back to this movie. Yes story isn't like original. But hey it's entertaining enough. Actors were good.All in all, a very entertaining movie.",7,0,1,30 December 2018
