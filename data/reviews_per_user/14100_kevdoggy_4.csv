The Blair Witch Project," Genius at work here...
","This is a wonderfully-crafted film, and it shows how much (or little) money matters in filmmaking.One way to tell how good a script is, is how UNSCRIPTED the dialogue sounds. I'm still not sure 'Blair Witch Project' operated on much of a script; I do know that regardless, the story moved along masterfully.I had heard that in early screenings, audiences who didn't know better really believed the film to be true, and were genuinely horrified.The true genius of this film is THAT I KNEW IT WAS FAKE, AND WAS STILL TRULY FRIGHTENED BY IT. (I'm a grown man not usually affected by such things.)
After first seeing this film, I used it as a yardstick when judging people I had just met.  I asked them if they had seen it, and asked them what they thought of it.Those that saw it and enjoyed it on some level, I decided, had some imagination and were people I wanted to know.  Those that disliked (or hated) it, were not the type I wanted to hang around with.Maybe it's TV, maybe its technology, maybe it's the lack of reading and education in our country, but there's a real dearth of imaginative people in the U.S.It's a shame.",9,1,2,4 August 2001
Any Given Sunday," I can still smell this movie...
","I love Oliver Stone's films.  He's a great storyteller.
Al Pacino is cool.  He's an icon for many because of 'Scarface', and is obviously one of our finest American actors.I also love football.  The simple premise:  'a film that depicts what happens behind the scenes in pro football' is fascinating.That's why I had such high hopes for this film.  Unfortunately, this film stinks of desperation; either Stone's to have a big hit film, or the studio's to do the same.I don't really remember anything about this movie other than there were a lot of loud smashing noises when the players hit one another on the field.It just didn't come together, and seemed terribly disjointed.  Stone the artist, I'm sure, could explain that this was purposeful, and added to the spinning realism of the film.I just found it loud and annoying.  Looking forward to your next film, Mr. Stone.",2,0,1,13 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," This is #17? Just shows how much this voting really means...
","The 17th best film of all time?  Maybe if you're 13.  This is a nice little adventure story, and quite frankly, if you think this is a great film, your nerd is showing.It's good, but I'm giving it a 3 just to balance out all the idiots, and there's 24,000 of them, that gave it a 10.  Get a life, people, or at least a girlfriend.It's actually more like a 6 or 7.George Lucas makes nice action figures.",3,18,93,25 April 2002
Donnie Darko," Interesting
","Not as good as some say, and not as bad as others.  The kind of movie that 'really makes you think' if you haven't spent much time thinking, which is probably why it's rated so high...plenty of kids voting.  Jake Gyllenhaal does a pretty good job, and Mary McDonnell is typically excellent.  Drew Barrymore is totally miscast, but since she 'exec produced' it, I guess she cast herself.  The politics stuff is totally out of place and ridiculous.  I liked the Church and Echo songs, and thought the 'music video' segments were neato.  An interesting film in an 'art for art's sake' way.  That's it.  If you think it's one of the best films ever made, you need to see more films. Go rent Touch of Evil right now.  What, you haven't even seen Citizen Kane yet?  Please stop voting on IMDB.",1,13,28,2 October 2003
