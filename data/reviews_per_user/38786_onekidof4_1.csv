Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie of the year
","Probably the funniest movie I have seen the entire year. The five minutes the entire movie I didn't spend laughing were spent trying to transfer popcorn from the bin to my mouth (efforts which were unsuccessful on account of the huge guy sitting behind me that kept laughing and shaking the seats, making me spill it everywhere). Entirely worth the overpriced 8.25$ I paid for admission. You can count on the fact that everyone at school or work tomorrow will be quoting this fun filled family movie on Monday. You'll probably realize that some scenes are staged, but the majority are not. In one scene, he makes a hotel clerk read a telegram to him saying that his wife was attacked, violated, and murdered by a bear while walking his retarded brother Bilo in Kazakhstan. Imagine trying to tell a foreign man that his wife was violated and killed by a bear. The beauty of the movie comes from capturing unsuspecting characters in awkward situations like the one mentioned above. In the words of the mighty man himself, 'Great success!'I have to keep typing more lines to be able to submit this, but can't really think of anything to say. You will not be disappointed. I still have to keep typing more lines. Geez, how many do I have to have? If you are going to see one movie this entire year, you have no life. But, if you really are one of these people, make it this one.",10,4,17,3 November 2006
