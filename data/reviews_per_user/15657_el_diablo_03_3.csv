Black Swan," 'Perfection is not just about control. It is also about letting go. Surprise yourself so you can surprise the audience. Transcendence. Very few have it in them'
","It is not altogether surprising that Aronofsky pulled another masterpiece with Black Swan. After all, he is eminent for some of the top-rated movies of all times including Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler. Not so different from his other movies, Black Swan somewhat achieves a similar style that is somehow dark, gloomy, and mysterious with a large focus on the main character's development.Aronofsky is known for bringing the movie to the screen from the main character's perspective. He does that this time with the black swan's main character: Nina. So thrilled about her next audition, Nina finds herself caught in the midst of an inner battle between her strive for perfection and the persistent urge to release herself from any means of control. The movie questions every aspect of perfection: what is perfection? Is it just about maintaining the control of every step we make so that we don't make mistakes? Or isn't it also about letting go and freeing one's self from any essence of control so that it can transcend and unleash its creativity. These are the main questions that the movie tries to demonstrate, and how striving for perfection can truly affect one's life. This is illustrated again from Nina's perspective and how attempting to perfect her role as the white/black swan affected her life in a significant manner.Great performance by Natalie Portman. You can truly see the diversity of the role she played and how it progresses with the movie; so calm and innocent in the beginning and tense and paranoid by the end of the movie. It truly explains the whole life-cycle of the journey toward perfection; your emotions are cool in the beginning but it gets more agitated as you progress with the role until it enters your personal life and creates damages due to the accompanied pressure and tension.Simply put, this is a beautiful movie that will make you attach yourself to the character and feel what she was going through. A must-watch!",10,1,4,19 January 2013
Ted," When reality meets fantasy!
","A funny movie that will make you laugh like you never laughed before. But why? The answer is simple. It's because it managed to use something that you've always been attached to when you were a kid, and twisted that a little to make something unique. That thing is a teddy bear toy. A teddy bear that talks! You won't hold yourself laughing after hearing any word that Ted is saying, even if it wasn't funny! It's the idea of having a speaking toy that is funny. Yeah we could say the same thing about Toy Story as well, but the argument here is that Ted managed to bring in the real-life element into the story. The story is still believable in every aspect. You won't feel the fantasy behind it, the character 'Ted' is part of our lives and the movie goes as far as even involving him in social and professional activities. He is treated like a normal person, just like me and you. So when you see that on the screen and you start to comprehend the fact that he is just a soft toy, that's when you'll start laughing and laughing! In summary, Ted is one of the funniest movies I would recommend to watch. There are however some nudity scenes and excessive use of obscene language so parents should think twice before allowing their young children to watch the movie. Otherwise, a great movie and a must-watch! 8/10",8,0,2,24 January 2013
The Island," A Brilliant job from Michael Bay. Good Summer movie!!
","I actually had the chance to see this movie here in New Zealand as it opened simultaneously with the US. I didn't expect much from the movie at first but I came up with surprising results!! After this movie all I can say is that Michael Bay is the expert in Action / Thriller kind of movies. After doing similar kind of stuff such as Armageddon and Bad Boys, he presented a movie with a realistic science fiction that will take your breath away! The Island takes place in the year 2019 which is not too far away and it is really hard to imagine how difficult would it be to present our world at that period, but again I'm proudly to say that Michael Bay did that really well so that the human mind can still believe that is the year 2019 with no doubt.Ewan McGregor is absolutely awesome in the movie as I think. He's a very good actor who can define himself and he did his role really well.And Oh! Let us not forget the sexy Scarlett Johansson which she really has a pretty bright future.To sum it up, The Island is the Science Fiction / Action movie of the year which is really recommended to those who like this kind of stuff (**** out of *****).",Null,4,10,22 July 2005
