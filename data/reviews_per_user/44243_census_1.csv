The Blair Witch Project," Intriguing
","The Blair Witch Project kept me riveted to my television screen. I felt the lost-ness of the three student film makers, and realized that maybe--just maybe--they encountered the Blair Witch and vanished like the many children she had killed. Heather was in command of the three-some until they really did get lost in the forest and the precious map was thrown into the river. From there on, the three were hopelessly lost in the woods without food, matches for a fire. They became more and more frightened and began loosing their sense of self and sanity. They turned on each other as they penetrated more and more deeply into Blair Witch territory. With their video film being found a year later, it can only be concluded that were overcome by the Blair Witch--never to be heard from again.",10,2,5,20 March 2006
