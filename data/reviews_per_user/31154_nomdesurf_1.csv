Requiem for a Dream," Not to get too esoteric but...
","I was explaining this movie to someone and realized that in summarizing it I didn't initially mention drugs at all. It went something like this: 'It's about four sad, struggling people who are all on the verge of a great moment in their lives. If they can pull it off, everything will work out for them, each one will lift themselves out of their situation.' (Then, of course, came the explanation of how they each struggle with their addiction.) It occurred to me that this is what made the movie so good -- ultimately, it's about the more universal struggle we deal with between our dreams and self-destructive behaviors that prevent us from attaining them. Every one of the characters at one point or another clearly shows that they know exactly how pathetic their life is, what it will take to overcome it, and what will undo them. That's the agony of this. And, thankfully, the one redemption that helps us not totally bum out for a week.",9,0,1,4 May 2005
