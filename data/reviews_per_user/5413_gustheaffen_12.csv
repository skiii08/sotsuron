The Blair Witch Project," Annoying screaming and crying for 80 minutes
","A masterpiece? This reminds me of summer camp in the woods where you psyche yourself out except even little kids don't scream, yell and cry like these people. The girl needed to go first - her behavior was over the top ridiculous and yet she always has the presence of mind to have her camera filming. Garbage that has been peddled as a great masterpiece. Probably one of the worst horror films ever made and I've seen a lot of bad ones.",1,5,8,25 July 2017
It," Not horror, a kids drama about pretty much nothing with bad CGI effects
","Good grief was this bad. I guess it tried to follow some of the book, it was all over the place. The kids were annoying and the stuttering was hilarious. They were all bad actors, the story was bad and he effects were just clownish. That was not a scary clown. Clowns are scarier not being overly CGI freakish. There is actually a sequel being promoted. Don't waste over 2 hours of your life and skip the sure to be ridiculously bad sequel.",1,1,3,29 August 2019
Hereditary," Nicely done
","I would suggest watching this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. There are some interesting and disturbing surprises, the acting is great, and if you like Rosemary's Baby - a slow burner without a lot of gore etc. you may enjoy this one. Those that think it is boring were probably looking for a different type of movie.",8,0,2,3 December 2018
Wind River," Entertaining but not original and too slow
","This was not an original story in any way. It was a movie version of almost any Longmire episode. And it was also very predictable. As soon as we were introduced to the murders you knew what happened. But it was executed well. All the characters were great with the exception of the lead female FBI agent - she was incredibly annoying, shrill, and I didn't see any chemistry with her or Renner. But the scenery was beautiful. Time also passed very slowly durning this movie. There wasn't anything bad about this movie, it just wasn't original and forgotten after watched.",6,9,21,15 March 2018
Us," Glad I saw this for free
","Wow, totally not a great movie. Long, boring and tedious. I guess the freaky doppelgÃ¤ngers were creepy but this movie dragged on an on. I saw where this was going the entire time too. I really don't get why everyone raves about Peele's movies. This was not some master piece. I would have been very disappointed to have seen this in the theater.",3,3,5,3 March 2020
Knives Out," Enjoyable: they go after everyone
","I enjoyed the old school Agatha Christie mysteries and this was reminiscent. They did interject some politics but I'd say they went after both sides. They were throwing insults at SJWs, alt right and putting both sides of immigration out there while a rich entitled liberal family fought for their fathers estate. Depending your political beliefs you could see whatever which was equally brilliant, the story and characters were entertaining. If anything I'd say the family characters weren't hugely developed but at a run time of 2 hours 10 minutes the point was made. I don't know the intent of the writing though knowing Hollywood politics I can make some assumptions and I still found it very enjoyable and funny. If you can't laugh at it you won't like it.",7,1,3,25 December 2019
Bird Box," Interesting concept, goes nowhere
","Much like A Quiet Place you never really know the origin of the 'beast' and you never even get a glimpse or idea. The concept is interesting, the flashbacks to tell the original story were initially compelling, however the rest of the film was really boring and Sandra Bullock is just being well Sandra Bullock. She isn't the greatest actress, she is aged and her voice and mannerisms are the same in every movie she is in.
One of Netflix's over-rated original content movies they hope will get their subscribers back. Much of the story was pretty predictable, I think that is why the first 30 minutes was the most interesting, seeing the dynamics of the original survivors, how they learned how to handle it, the human interaction and results. Some of their choices were so dumb though it was hard to believe. Should be a lesson to bleeding hearts what happens when you make pollyanna choices.",3,3,6,6 January 2019
A Quiet Place," How did this borefest end up with a 7.8?!!!!!!!!!
",I should know better than to expect much from this type of movie. I didn't expect to be bored to tears and have virtually no dialogue for the majority of the movie. This movie started after whatever event took place to get the aliens (if that was what they even were) on earth and ended ridiculously. If you can shoot and kill these beasts why didn't they do that earlier? What happens if you snore? Or sneeze? Do they hear you?! If they can't hear you over water why no move by the water or simulate that sound at your house?! Why was the kid so dumb in the beginning with his toy when he clearly was old enough to understand be quiet. And wouldn't the others have screamed and also been attacked?! I could go on and on as others did with the many flaws. Thankfully they didn't extent this trash to over 2 hours. I wouldn't even call this horror or a thriller. Very predictable and boring.,2,2,8,14 July 2018
Midsommar," Good grief, not deep just hysterically horrible, long and BORING
","He should have dumped the chick when her family died and told her step off. Why anyone would go to such a boring place and endure all this insanity, typical people go missing and no one bothers to worry much even though there is no other place they could have realistically gone.The moving is BORING and LONG. I can't believe there was some version with another 25 minutes to bore yourself to tears. The parts that were supposed to be deep or serious were just LOL stupid. Oh yeah at 72 we jump off a tall rock tower. Nothing weird about that. Here is our freaky inbred sight master.Glad she found a new family. Frankly major injustice was served. He was drugged and tricked into a sex romp. She knowingly offed him and celebrated having a new family. Nothing remotely redeeming about this trash heap.",1,2,7,10 February 2020
Don't Breathe," Horror movies today are just horrible
","Wow, what a waste of talent. I finally saw this when it came on cable, what a disappointment. The story plot of a trio going to rob a blind veteran that lost his daughter automatically has you despising the characters. Predictably they underestimate their target and walk into a booby trapped house. But the blind guy apparently hasn't had his sense of smell overcompensate for his blindness because he can't smell them hiding right under his nose while sweating bullets. A lot of cat and mouse and then the added introduction of weirdness finding out the blind guy isn't anyone to root for either. A better ending would have been for the final character to have not escaped w/the money. They are planning a sequel. Can't imagine where you go from this mess. If you want to see a good booby trapped house movie see The Collector.",4,6,12,15 May 2017
It Chapter Two," Horrible, long, hilarious CGI
","Not enjoyable. Too long, relied way too much on CGI for scares, not scary at all. Did not follow much of the actual story. Pretty sad when a cheap mini series is 100 times better than an expensive 'blockbuster'. Skip it.",1,1,1,1 July 2020
Marriage Story," Been done before and this was just boring and insufferable
",A lot of people say a version of Kramer vs Kramer but almost more The Story of Us or even War of the Roses. The decades are full of movies about the destruction of marriages and this was just long and boring. Also unintentionally funny and not realistic. Guess it is the millennial version. Screaming I wish you get a horrible disease and die was hilarious and that fight was so forced and unnatural. And can a film get any more insufferable than forcing us to sit through the ugly main actors ridiculous song near the end that went on for 5 minutes?! Probably the best roles were the attorneys and child observer and I did laugh and think his knife cut was about the most entertaining aspect. I can't believe this was nominated for a bunch of awards and that was why I watched it only to be severely bored and unentertained. Really just a stupid trashy movie.,3,98,174,12 December 2019
