The Avengers," A must see!
","The Avengers is the story of a group of superheroes who are forced to come together to save the planet from the God of mischief Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Who happens to be the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). The team made up of Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), The Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and directed by Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson). Loki has come to earth seeking to control the human race with the help of an object known as the Tesseract and is not to be taken likely. Not even his brother Thor can stop his madness. The Avengers must defend the world from Loki's reign and despite their differences and pent up tension towards each other, come together to make sure that the world stays safe.The movie pretty much goes along with the comic books throughout the entire thing. However, I wish that Loki would have been portrayed just a little bit differently. In the comics, he's a crazy God obsessed with his power and causing absolute chaos and ruin. Tom Hiddleston makes a good Loki, but I feel as though if he had made him just a tad more crazy, he would have made a better Loki. Because really, he's the God of mischief. Asgard's own trickster. Not the God of pity or self-loathing.The graphics are really eye popping and keep the movie more real feeling. There is a part where Thor, Captain America, and Black Widow are all on the streets and this explosion happens directly behind them. The color of the flames made your eyes immediately go to the explosion, then the movement in Black Widow's hair draws your eyes from the flame to her, and from there out to the other characters surrounding her.The storyline flows really nice as well. Going from one point to the next without making you wonder what the heck is going on. There may be one or two points that may becoming confusing for someone who hasn't read the comics or seen the previous Marvel movies, but overall the story is pretty easy to follow.The Avengers to me is a must see movie even if you aren't a huge super hero fan. It's filled with a suspenseful story line, eye pleasing graphics,an excellent cast of actors, and lives up to its hype.",9,0,3,15 November 2012
