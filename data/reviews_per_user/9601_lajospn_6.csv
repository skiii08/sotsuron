Walk the Line," Phoenix *is* Cash
","Without Joaquin Phoenix the movie would be nothing. With him it's everything. He's in every scene and it makes the movie. Don't believe the hype, it's *not* Reese Whiterspoon, not at all. She's just her usual self, that's it. It's Phoenix, that takes this movie from its standard biopic level to emotional heights. Laugh and cry. It's about a rock/country star's life so don't be surprised to see down waves but what's interesting is the up-beats, the heart of the man in black. Being obsessed by a woman, throwing away everything for a lifestyle, was it worth it? Well, I think it was. No matter how much a low-life you are if you can take a guitar and start singing a song that will take your breath away.",10,5,10,24 November 2005
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Who's evil after all?
","OK, at this point, we must ask ourselves: does destroying a high-tech, fully-staffed, peaceful underground facility of immense proportions further the cause of survival of the human race or not? I mean, it seems like in this post-apocalyptic world the only organization retaining any semblance of civilization is the Umbrella Corporation. The series is entering a phase where four ragged survivors in Mad Max clothes are The Only Hope (never mind that they can barely feed themselves let alone fix a super-computer system) while a bio-tech company working on, you know, the cure that could save them all is the Ultimate Evil. Who do they think will fix all this if they keep breaking all the beakers?",5,3,7,16 September 2010
Star Trek," Predictable, Silly, Popcorn Flick. And cheap too ..
","First, a disclaimer: I'm not a Trekkie. By a long shot. I couldn't give a hoot about how the movie fits in with the Star Trek 'canon'. Honestly, I couldn't care less. I watched it with an open mind, looking for entertainment. What I got instead was a bunch of frat boys and bimbos playing movie night, together with squirm inducing dialog, forced attempts at humor, and pandering to the Comic Book Guy fans (who got all the inside references about star fleet regulations, I'm sure). And yes, the plot was a mess.Just a quick list:<ul><li>Kid Kirk driving the old car into the canyon, jumping out just in time to grab onto the edge of the abyss. What the ...?</li></ul><ul><li>Lots of scenes were clearly shot inside some chemical plant. (Several stories high building with winding pipes running all over the place, etc.) I didn't know that space ships looked so much like your local sewage processing plant.</li></ul><ul><li>6 billion people (OK, Vulcans) die, yet everybody acts as if it were 'no biggie' (or maybe they were just that bad as actors? Who knows?) The unimaginable just happened and you were half expecting the crew to high- five each other by the end. Honestly, the guards at Auschwitz must have shown more understanding for a tragedy of such epic proportions.</li></ul><ul><li>Contriving to have each original character utter his/her 'catchphrase' was so obviously forced that it was literally embarrassing to watch. I felt sorry for the actors. (Some people actually half-clapped when the old chestnuts were let slip. What the ...?)</li></ul><ul><li>I know it's a stupid Star Trek tradition, but I found it 'illogical' (thank you, Mr. Spock), if not outright idiotic that it was always the highest echelons of the command structure that went on suicidal commando style missions. (It happened at least three times. At least.) There is a reason why armies no longer have their generals leading the charge: they are harder to replace than infantry (ensigns, red shirts, etc.) Mild complaint, but it got pretty annoying given how everybody was supposed to be so 'intelligent'.</li></ul><ul><li>I found quite amusing the movie's sophomoric implication that Kirk's getting in a fight every minute or two is the surest implication that he'll make a good captain. It follows that Mike Tyson would make the best captain of the Enterprise. Ever. (You have a problem with that!?) Also, it was nice touch to have Spock and Kirk go mano o mano for the captainship (and becoming friends). Maybe the authors watched Fight Club one time too many? </li></ul>Funny thing is, with all the fawning, this is just another Star Trek movie (translation: campy melodrama with predictable plot).",1,228,356,10 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," For (dumb) Kids Only
","I saw the Empire Strikes Back when I was a kid. I liked it. I saw it again when I was a teenager. I still liked it. Just to make sure that I was correct I watched it again before going to see the pre-quels. I was still amazed by the story, the characters, everything. Now, let's talk about TroS. It was empty, devoid of any emotion, full of ridiculous pieces of dialogue, unbelievable situations, unbelievable characters, fights without suspense, meaningless space battles. The movie tried to cling on to 'themes' from Star Wars like R2-D2, 3-CPO, Wookies, etc. But why? The first time the droids were funny, the sixth time they are not even annoying, they are just pointless reminders of the glory days. I couldn't care less what happened to them. The scene where R2 saves the heroes by remotely controlling an elevator: where did I see something like this? The main problem with repeating scenes from previous SW movies is that the audience already knows the scene so it's not original anymore. Worse still the audience already knows the outcome too, there goes suspense. So what's left is a mechanic execution of a trite re-enactment.CGI makes repetition easy. Once you create a very detailed model of a huge starship it costs next to nothing to replicate that starship on the screen. The computer happily renders another instance. Problem is, we already know that repetition is easy to do with computers. 'How many starship are there in this battle? Fifty !? Let's add another hundred, no wait, *two* hundred to make it more awesome.' Why should I be amazed that some technician typed in a large number into a pop-up dialog window? And I had the feeling that in every single scene somebody boosted the numbers without constraint, beyond reason. Buildings were not just large, they were GIGANTIC. Literally, miles high buildings were the standard, not the exception. But all this left me unimpressed because I know that the height of the building is just another parameter for the computer and it's a trivial thing to render a building that is larger than mount Everest.Overall, the movie is in the same league with the other two pre-quels. A really bad movie with a lot of over-blown CGI. Good with popcorn.",1,14,28,20 May 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," My Gosh, was Jodie Foster weak in this one ...
","I saw it recently again, and I'm surprised how weak her acting skills were at the time. I'm not even sure why they picked her: I remembered her as somewhat mousy, but boy, does she look like a secretary. Not only that, on repeated viewings, it's obvious her character was written much smarter than she is: out of the blue, she suddenly burps out something very clever, but you can tell by her delivery and the look in her eyes that she just would have been able to come up with that on her own. Very weird.Another thing that occurred to me this time, how come the nurses in the asylum are so, I don't know, sympathetic to Lecter? At the very beginning, we're told that he gruesomely and cold-heartedly maimed a nurse (presumably female) while she was trying to give him an EKG. Granted, he always 'justifies' his killings (most of them patients of him, often revolting, like his cell mate), but still. I could never treat a man maiming someone who was trying to help him with anything except extreme contempt and caution. The nurses, they seemed OK with him.Still immensely watchable, but I see a lot more faults now than I remembered.",10,1,3,25 September 2010
Sin City," Gory Emptiness
","I went in the cinema expecting something novel. I got the standard fare instead. Tough talking gangsters? Whores with guns? Extreme violence? The movie should have a big 'Recycled' stamp all over it. Basin City is Gotham City, but to a T. Nothing new here. The character of the concrete tough guy Marv (played nicely by Mickey Rourke, I must admit) was nothing new: he reminded me of the 'overtaker' in William Gibson's novel 'Idoru'. In the novel the 'overtaker' is a big guy, full of scars, torturing criminals to death in order to get their money, but his heart (who would guess?) is made of gold. Oh yeah, and he wields a hatchet sometimes. Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis as Hallenbeck. Oh, wait a minute, that was his name in the Last Boy Scout! Here he's called Hartigan. The differences are imperceptible. Since Tarantino is involved we have the obligatory Katana wielding Samurai whore. Luckily she doesn't talk too much (maybe she's a deaf-mute?). The difference from Kill Bill is that now she's using not one, wait for it!, but TWO full-size Katana at the same time! (And of course she likes to throw shuriken. Although if both hands are full how can she throw a shuriken? Maybe she spits them out? Who knows?) Comic book feel means that people like to jump off from great heights for great visual effect. (Really, how many times did one character or another fell ten-storeys or so just for fun? I stopped counting.) After realizing that there's not going to be anything new in this movie I tried to enjoy it for its own sake. Boy, was it difficult. The dialog is bad, bad, and worse. I don't care if this is because it's supposed to be a comic book. So what? If they use a retarded 10-year-old to write the script and the result is incomprehensible, is it an excuse that he's retarded? What is this, special Olympics? GET SOMEBODY WHO CAN WRITE BEFORE DOING A MOVIE! Comic book fans can have (enjoy?) the original 'corny but brilliant' conversations. They can have the plot too. It commits the biggest crime a story can do: it's boring. By the time the movie got back to Hallenbeck's story the second time I wished it'd been over already. Really, there was nothing to keep my attention story-wise. Absolutely nothing. Here is the pattern: bad guys show up, good guy's sure to die, I'm sure he won't die, yawn, he manages, yawn, to escape (uninterestingly), yawn, bad guys die horrible deaths. Back to square 1: bad guys show up, ...Maybe it's the comic book tradition but bad guys always shoot at the body while the good guys, cleverly, shoot at the head.One more thing: maybe if they cast Rutger Hauer as Hartigan and Benicio Del Toro (without the stupid makeup) as Dwight the movie could have been better. (These two could turn the corniest of dialogs into something interesting.)Ah, I almost forgot. The violence part: take it away and nothing remains but emptiness.",2,3,7,4 April 2005
