Hereditary," Horror Is Back Being Orginal Once Again!
","This film is a masterpiece not only from a filmmaking perspective but also an acting sense. This film brings tension, suspense and a fantastic story. I've been seeing bad reviews from people on IMDB saying it was boring, I honestly have no idea what you were talking about as this film was physiological in every way. It told its story in such a unique way that I was hooked from start to finish. Thank god this film is getting great reviews as for me audiences have forgotten what true horror is. 10/10",10,4,8,18 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Cheap and lazy
","This film is the worst in the franchise so far, awful cgi and a script which makes everyone Jar Jar Binks level annoying. This film reminded me of the awful Star Wars prequels where everyone walked around blue screen sets due to marvel wanting to budget cut. This film is the most overrated film I've ever seen. AwfulThey have ruined the Hulk character.",1,5,11,7 August 2018
