Mission: Impossible III," Much Darker But Still Entertaining Threequel
","The Third mission impossible is an improvement upon the 'Not worth watching' MI2, but it still suffers from plot issues. The story isn't nearly as compelling as the first, but is still more of a personal Mission Impossible. It went with a ton of action, using shaky camera movements (Which I hate, BTW), and is much more serious than the first two. It is worth watching, with some really tense moments.",8,0,0,3 March 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," This Movie truly lives up to its Name as another 'Mission Impossible' Movie.
","This film has well choreographed action, a understandable and compelling story, and nice dialogue. You will be entertained throughout, with its tense moments and shocking plot-twists.",9,0,1,3 March 2019
Mission: Impossible II," Cheesy Action Flick, But Well Done Action.
","Mission Impossible II Doesn't live up to its predecessor's potential, and takes a new turn. Instead of being a tense spy-thriller, it decides to be a cheesy action flick, with Tom Cruise flipping every five seconds and over the top explosions, fights, etc. However I will say the car chase at the third act was entertaining, even though its ridiculous scenes and uninteresting plot doesn't make it worth it. Finally this movie uses masks way to much. They used them a few times in the last one, but they overuse them way to much in this. Not worth watching.",4,0,0,3 March 2019
Mission: Impossible," Clever But Sometimes Boring
","If your looking for a action-paced thriller you won't exactly get it. The camera work is dated, and there are hardly and fight scenes. However, the plot is still compelling, while on a smaller scale than the other films, and entertains in certain scenes. The whole movie isn't really that intense, but you will enjoy it if you love spy thrillers.",7,0,1,3 March 2019
