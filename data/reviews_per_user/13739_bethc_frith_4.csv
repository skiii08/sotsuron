Marie Antoinette," Enjoyable if you can get past the inaccuracies
","So this film got absolutely slammed by the critics, and although i enjoyed the film i can see why it got slammed.It seemed very odd that most of the cast at least adopted the accents of the country they were living in, even of they weren't speaking the language. Marie Antionette and Lois were speaking in out and out American accents! It just seemed a bit odd, either have everybody adopting accents or nobody adopting accents, but to mix it up just seems a bit odd.saying that it was still an entertaining film in my opinion, the costumes were nothing short of breathtaking and despite the foolishness of Marie Antionettes actions, you do end up feeling sorry for her toward the end.You'll enjoy this film providing you don't take it to seriously",6,0,0,31 January 2013
Life of Pi," well worth a watch
","Well what can i say? This film was absolutely breathtaking!I went to see it in 3d, i'm not normally a fan of 3d but in certain scenes it just absolutely took my breath away! It was one of those films where i didn't want it to end! The film went into a lot of detail into the main characters childhood which although interesting and definitely tantamount to the story, i did feel a bit impatient to get to the 'good bits'! take a hankie though, its a bit of a tearjerker in places! All in all a very enjoyable film and it will definitely be added to my DVD collection!I do recommend seeing it in 3d, even if you're not normally a 3d fan, as it will certainly add to your viewing pleasure!",9,2,5,1 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I enjoyed it, but i can see why others may not have
","Prior to seeing this i'd heard quite a few bad reviews about The Hobbit, the main problem being that it was 'boring' and nothing much happening in it.Me being a huuuuge fan of LOTR decided to go and see it and find out for myself. I personally enjoyed it although i can see why others didn't. This is very much all about setting the scene (in fact its about an hour before we even leave Bilbo's house). The book certainly doesn't spend long focusing on the conversations between the dwarfs, Gandalf and Bilbo however being as this is gonna be three films i guess they wanted to pad it out as long as possible. As enjoyable as the film is its certainly nowhere near as dramatic as LOTR nor is their as much suspense. There is a good dose of humour though and it is good to see Sir Ian Mckellen back as Gandaf the gray, not to mention Christopher Lee playing a good Sarumon!",7,1,6,30 January 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Entertaining? Yes. Scary? No
","Well its a bit of a mixed bag this one. On the one hand its original and does keep you guessing a lot of the way through, i did wonder if it was gonna have a kind of hostel like twist to it (it didn't).I must admit my heart sank when it transpired that zombies were gonna be the enemy! Honestly i am soooooooooo sick of zombie movies now, its like everybody is obsessed with them at the moment! Its been so overdone now and if i've seen one zombie movie, i've seen them all! In my opinion zombies aren't even that scary! Anyway, i digress! So the bits right up to the zombies were quite enjoyable, my trouble is i can't get my head around films that are both realistic and fantasy all at the same time. If its obvious from the start that its a fantasy that i'm cool with that. But not once did anybody utter the words 'but this is ridiculous, zombies, witches and werewolves don't exist', unless they lived in a world where, zombies, witches werewolves did exist and everybody knew about it but got on with their daily lives regardless, in which case the film writers should have made it more obvious.I was a bit confused as to who the cabin belonged to. It was supposed to be one of the group's cousin, so does this mean the cousin was in on it too? If so what was his motive for wanting to kill off a member of his family. If the cousin wasn't in on it then that just doesn't seem feasible that some random corporate company could build a forcefield around your property, fill it with camera and bury some zombies in the ground without the owner being a little bit suspicious.I liked it for its originality, but i wouldn't watch it again anytime soon",5,0,1,9 February 2013
