The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," An improvement
","I didn't think it was funny in an unintentional way (which I usually do with Twilight Saga movies). It has its problems. The way Bella handles her pregnancy bothers me. The way Bella is so willing to marry Edward without meaningful consideration (which is horrid for someone at her age) bothers me. The dialogue is lacking in some parts too. The action is badly handled, at least when compared to the books. There is no tension or excitement really. However, I must say, all of the main actors's acting skills greatly improved. Visually well done.",6,0,0,8 April 2020
Fight Club," Book and movie
","The movie made the intentions/messages of the book clearer, which was useful. I wish it was more faithful to the novel in some parts. The different ending though? Definitely a downgrade.",6,0,1,8 April 2020
Akira," Shock to the system
","I need more feature length animated films like this. Gritty, unafraid of violence, layered storyline, and quite detailed animation. What a fun watch! I watched it for the first time in ten years the other day and it stands up to the test of time. Amazing work! Would love to find something else like it.",10,0,0,11 May 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Heavy-handed
","Really heavy-handed with the topic it's dealing with, but then again, the movie centers around infiltration into a blatantly racist organization... Predictable. It's an important film, but nonetheless. I was not blown away. I plan on reading the book someday though.",5,4,8,7 April 2020
Ant-Man," Relatable AND Entertaining
","To me, this is by far the most relatable superhero story so far out of the Marvel movie universe. It felt very organic, which is surprising considering it's about a man who can shrink by the power of a special suit.",8,0,0,8 April 2020
The Revenant," Beautiful cinematography for a successful Oscar bait
","I preferred his adventure over what happened after. Turns into a rather cliche story once the, in my opinion, 'main' part is over. Camera work in phenomenal. Leo's acting is great, but Oscar worthy? Eh. Debatable. Other characters are alright, but they mostly are walking stereotypes.",7,0,0,8 April 2020
American Psycho," Bale is stellar as Bateman, but the film favors gore over commentary
","Bale does an excellent job of playing Bateman. However, the movie is not nearly as impactful as the book.",5,0,5,8 April 2020
The Shape of Water," A grower
","As time goes forward, I appreciate the film more and more, largely thanks to a Lindsay Ellis video essay. Beautifully filmed and nuanced love story if you can get over the whole fish man aspect.",7,0,7,7 April 2020
The Mission," Beautiful settings, not-so-great acting
","Weakly plotted, poor character development, overacted, and full to the brim with cliches. To top it all off, none of the lead actors even attempt a Spanish or Portuguese accent. I found the indigenous people to be more interesting than any of the main characters, which is unfortunate since 'The Mission' is not their story, but just a story that features them. It's the first movie I've seen in a long time that I wanted to walk out of, but stayed because I was able to lower my standards. That still didn't prevent me from rolling my eyes at majority of the film. The ending is what saved 'The Mission.' The beautiful settings were a plus.",3,1,2,8 April 2020
Lucy," Desperate to be smart, but fails
","It tried desperately to be smart, but kinda failed with it's gaping plot holes, unexplainable change of character personality, and fails in scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, the movie was an interesting concept that if executed properly, it would've been the next 'Inception.' The special effects were great and that's the only quality of this movie that didn't bother me in some way.",5,3,7,8 April 2020
The Breakfast Club," Ages okay
","I spent a good bit of the movie being very uncomfortable with how they treat Claire. The ending made no sense with who got 'coupled up' and who did not. Is it of it's time? Honestly, it's hard to tell. If it is of it's time, I'm glad I wasn't a teen in the 1980's. I would say that this movie stands out as a more realistic writing of teens by a grown person compared to most teen movies.",6,3,4,26 April 2020
Contact," Palmer excluded, excellent film
","The only flaw in this film is Palmer's presence. His presence devalued the storyline by forcing some terrible, uninteresting relationship into a plot that did not need his presence. Aside from Palmer, this movie is excellent and poses layered questions about humanity and our ethics if we are ever to come into contact with aliens.",8,1,1,8 April 2020
The Martian," Book and Movie on Par with One Another -- Both Just a Bit Above Okay
","I've seen better space films, but I'm not sure if that's the fault of the film or the book (as it's also not the best book about space).",6,0,2,8 April 2020
