Catch Me If You Can," Super super super
","My sister and I, one a film major and one just an extremely great critic of movies, both heartily agreed that our time has never been utilized better than with the few hours we spent watching, 'Catch Me If You Can'.  It was inspirational.  I have used several of Frank Abagnale Jr.'s marvelous schemes so far.  That is, legal versions of his antics.  Even if this movie doesn't receive any awards, I hope that Tom H. and Steven S. and Leo D. know in their hearts that they have created something worthwhile, a treasure of a movie, that was not only absolutely entertaining, but rich and deep and full of every virtue that a deliciously fascinating, joyous, touching, and great movie possesses.  Anyone who doesn't find this movie just super, is off their rocker, because, folks, it was just one of the best movies I've ever seen, the character development was superb, the characters themselves were charming even when they were in the height of despair or distress, the plot flowed well, the story was incredible, and the message was just spiffy. Well done everyone who worked on that movie, especially Leonardo, Tom, and Steven!  I hope you are proud of yourselves, because we sure are!",Null,0,1,26 January 2003
