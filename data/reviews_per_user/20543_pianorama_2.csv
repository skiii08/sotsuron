Walk the Line," The most inspiring movie I have ever seen - uplifting!
","I have seen it a total of 42 times. I had never listened to Johnny Cash before, having grown up listening to classical music (I am a pianist and composer). My listening ears are now immersed in the music of Johnny Cash, June Carter and the Carter Family. In this day and age of sensationalism of 'celebrities' and short-term memory deficit of the general public, I am amazed that James Mangold, Cathy Konrad, T-Bone Burnett, and everyone involved in the making of this film have persevered and created something so heart-breakingly beautiful. This is not just a movie; it is a work of art. The actors, as well, have placed their very souls on the line in this film and in doing so, they have become, not just actors but artists. I would see it 42 more times if I could.",10,0,1,2 January 2006
The Da Vinci Code," great movie, great performances
","The critics are out to lunch on this one; I can't believe that so-called 'critics' are giving this film less than 5 stars. I read the book and thought the movie was every bit as good. I sat on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. The performances were entirely believable, the tension was palpable, the chase scenes heart-stopping, and the big brotherly affection from Robert Langdon (Hanks) toward Sophie Neveu (Tatou) was touching.Tom Hanks is a seasoned actor and it is thrilling to see him at the top of his game - again! His genius shows, such as the scene when he was in the back of the van and freaking out in a restrained/constrained way. The viewer could feel his inner panic. Jean Reno should win an award for the intensity of his performance; it is great to see an actor of his calibre in a film such as this. Furthermore, this may be the best film that Ron Howard has ever so lovingly and passionately made.Of course, the book is a work of 'fiction,' but I believe that the reason so many people are upset by the book and now reacting against this film is that it may contain more than a grain of truth. Who knows? I totally loved this movie and plan to see it more than once. When it comes out on DVD I will definitely add it to my collection.",10,1,2,4 June 2006
