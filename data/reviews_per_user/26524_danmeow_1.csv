Alien 3," Tragedy
","This is my favorite part of the franchise.
If I would sum up all of them in one word, Alien would be 'Terror', Aliens 'Action' and Alien3 'Tragedy'. 
Right from the start we witness a depressing and futile story.
I am glad it was not just a continuation of Aliens, as many wished.
For the first and last time Ripley gets a worthy relationship resulting in... tragedy.
And the music score is beautiful and moving.",8,2,3,19 May 2018
