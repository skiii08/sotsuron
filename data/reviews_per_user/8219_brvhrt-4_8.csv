The Blair Witch Project," Caution... hype kills
","I greatly admired and appreciated what THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was supposed to be.  Supposedly shot for less than the price of a car, unknown actors, POV camcorder work, no musical score... a very gutsy and ambitious project. The film was marketed brilliantly.  Everyone wondered, 'Is it real?'  Enough so that every show was a sellout while in limited release.  And slowly, the hype kept building... 'The greatest horror movie since THE EXORCIST.'Don't believe the hype.  For all its originality and ambition, it's a disappointing scare.  Too few heart-thumping moments.  It's a story more about how not to get lost in the woods than about any witch or ghost.  I understand the concept: don't let the audience know anything more than the characters.  Use sparse sounds and suggestions; let the audience's imagination do the rest.  But here's the problem with that: there's no payoff.  You're left TOO MUCH to your own imagination.  A fleeting glimpse of SOMETHING in the last camera shot is all it would have taken to satisfy me (and most of the audience, judging by the reaction I heard in the theatre).It's a brilliantly shot film.  A wonderful concept.  If it were my student film project, I'd expect an A.  I just wouldn't expect people to pay 8 bucks to see it.",5,0,2,22 July 1999
We Were Soldiers," Be warned...
","WE WERE SOLDIERS is not the kind of movie I feel comfortable saying 'I enjoyed' or 'I liked.'  But I'm not sure that's the reaction one is supposed to have upon seeing it.  GLORY and BRAVEHEART took us to the middle of the battlefield like never before.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN showed us the frenzied chaos of modern warfare with new and brutal realism. WE WERE SOLDIERS may end up being the film that some claim goes too far in portraying the unspeakable horror of war.  I attended a screening that consisted largely of Vietnam veterans and their wives.  Several attendees excused themselves suddenly during the battlefield scenes which make up more than half of the movie.  Many watched through covered faces and teary eyes. But when the credits began to roll, not a soul moved.  Not one.  It was only when the lights came up that the audience responded with brief applause before getting up to leave.  And I am sure I am not the only one who left the theatre with a sickening knot in my stomach.The story of WE WERE SOLDIERS is thin at best.  After an introduction to the major characters, all are thrown into the hell of battle, either the physical hell of Vietnam or the mental anguish of waiting on the homefront for news one hopes never comes.  For the rest of the movie, it becomes about one thing: which characters will stay alive?  Which, I realize, is part of the point in a movie like this, because that's what it became about for the soldiers: staying alive.  Not how they got there, not whether or not they should have been there, not how they felt about being there-- just staying alive.  And the battlefield scenes are the most horrific I have ever seen, previously cited examples included. They are gory, they are long, they are brutally relentless.  Again, I understand that is perhaps part of the point, part of the lesson about war.  But that is a hard thing to ask of a theatre full of people who have paid 8 dollars apiece to see a movie that doesn't look especially violent based on the trailer.In the end, I can't say I 'enjoyed' WE WERE SOLDIERS.  I can't say I 'liked' it.  What I can say is that, for the first time, I may have some tiny, infinitesimal, ultimately meaningless fraction of a notion of what my father-in-law went through in Vietnam, and why he's never spoken a word about it to anyone.  And that, perhaps, is a much more important thing to be able to say.",6,0,0,22 February 2002
Pitch Black," Watching pitch black would be better
","Without question, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I wasn't sure I was even seeing the final print of the film.  Unfortunately, I was.  Some interesting uses of lighting and film exposure are the only redeeming qualities.  Vin Diesel may turn out to be a genuine talent, but this film won't get him there.",1,1,3,7 February 2000
U-571," It's not a history lesson
","No one ever said it's 100% historically accurate.  That's why it's a movie on the big screen with professional actors and not a filmstrip from my 7th grade history class.  This is a white-knuckle thrill ride with tense moments galore.  Sure, some creative liberties were taken.  But I think the realism of the sub scenes is a testament to the submariners to whom the film is dedicated.  And if adding some drama allows the story of their real-life sacrifices to be shared by more people, so much the better.  U-571 is a blast.  Just remember to come up for air.",8,0,1,18 April 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Call me Stupid American
","Beautifully shot, beautifully acted, beautifully choreographed, beautifully scored.  I just can't get past the fact that people fly in this movie- just float away in the middle of an otherwise breathtaking fight scene.  My wife chalked it up to a 'cultural difference' that I couldn't possibly understand.  Perhaps.  Is there some Chinese legend I don't know about that says true martial arts masters can fly?  Bending the laws of gravity is one thing.  But when a character raises one fist and lifts off the ground a la Superman, my suspension of disbelief stops there.  I could have seen my way past it if it had even been explained within the context of the plot.  But it's just put up there, and we're meant to take it on faith that for whatever reason, these people can fly.  The flying didn't even seem to serve a true purpose, except to make the film even more 'visually stimulating.'  I thought the fight scenes were so good, the flying was an unnecessary effect that tainted my view of the rest of the movie.  I'm disappointed that my most lasting impression of this otherwise stunning film will be of people floating away to the snickering of the audience.",6,0,0,11 January 2001
The Insider," A long 'drag'
","Al Pacino is his usual brilliant self.  Russell Crowe impresses while playing a character much older than he is.  And a good story.  But in typical Michael Mann style, the film could use some editing.  It drags on much longer than is necessary while Mann holds scenes, inserts seemingly random camera shots, plays with focus, and does his hand-held thing way too much.  Most of the theatre began checking their watches at a certain point. In the end, it's still a good movie.  But unfortunately, the running time took away from my overall enjoyment.  Lose 20 minutes and it becomes a great movie.",6,0,1,5 November 1999
The Green Mile," Wrap up the Oscar...
","...and give it to the makers of THE GREEN MILE.  While you're at it, go ahead and engrave the Best Supporting Oscar with the name of Michael Clarke Duncan.  This is everything a movie is supposed to be.  The only reason I voted it a 9 rather than a 10 is a needless explanatory speech at the end... I got it the first time around.  I didn't need it explained to me afterward.",9,0,0,30 November 1999
The Replacements," Incomplete pass
","I feel bad for ripping apart a movie whose heart is in the right place. But cliche is cliche, and this movie's full of them.  I know that deep down, there was a heartwarming story there about heart and guts and love of the game, but it never really came out the way it should have.  Most characters were little more than two-dimensional stereotypes.  Substorylines picked up out of nowhere and were dropped just as suddenly.  Almost every popular song from the last decade is thrown in somewhere as a way to move the plot along, but it's an obvious attempt to disguise the lack of story.  The funniest moments are blown in the trailer, and the climatic will-they-or-won't-they scenes are all too often interrupted by needless shots of cheerleaders, well after their subplot has played out.  Keanu's big motivational huddle speech is a slogan I read on a T-shirt 10 years ago.  Even John Madden and Pat Summerall are reduced to cariacatures of themselves; Madden is allowed- make that forced- to rattle off all of his trademark lines, but only for the sake of the schtick.  The football strike is a story perfectly suited for an underdog movie, even a funny one.  All of the elements were there.  But instead of landing in the same category as BULL DURHAM or CADDYSHACK, this one ends up being as forgettable as BASEKETBALL.",3,1,3,26 July 2000
