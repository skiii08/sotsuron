Your Name.," Touching and stunning
","I am not a huge anime fan. But this movie is one for everyone, it is a must see. The visuals are phenomenal, music is catchy and the story is heartbreaking. The story is about a boy who switches his body with a girl he does not know, but not for always only in some periods. There are so much funny situations, but all in one its sad and depressing. I would suggest the movie to all anime enthusiasts and who love the visuals.",9,5,7,18 October 2017
