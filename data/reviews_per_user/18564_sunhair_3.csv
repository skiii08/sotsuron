Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," NOT disappointed
","I don't know if I would call myself a star wars fan, but I did grow up with it and have seen the three other episodes a number of times. To me it seems like people don't really understand what this movie is all about. It is not to be compared with any other movie, let alone the matrix which people have the tendency of doing, the only other films this movie is capable of being compared to is the other Star wars films and even that is quite difficult because of the twenty year gap. Furthermore this movie is not an action picture it's not even really sci fi it is however a fairy tale full of arch types, good vs. evil and the significance of both aspects.Now Darth Maul IS NOT Darth vader and really shouldn't be treated as such. The real bad guy, if anyone have noticed, is of course palpatine and he is also one of the characters who lift this episode up to the standard of the earlier ones. Yes Jah jah is annoying but so was Luke. Ewan Mcgregor does a very good job as Obi Wan and in general the acting is better or at least as good this time around. My only problem is the tempo (too fast) but hopefully viewing it a couple of times more will compensate for that.",Null,0,0,30 August 1999
American History X," Ouch!! my teeth
","Very real and very damn good movie about a skinhead, who has to kill two people and go to prison to see that the only thing he was doing was to destroy him and his family's lives. Exellent debut by British director Tony Kaye, who chose a very un-British subject for his first film.",10,0,0,17 February 1999
Carrie," Carrie is not that scary,but...
","Even though I wouldn't categorize this as a horror movie, rather a psychological thriller,it is still good and very intense .Sissy Spacek does a good job as Carrie you just can't help sympathizing with her.The film is closer to drama than slasher and is more comparable to say Deer Hunter than Halloween.",9,0,0,25 March 1999
