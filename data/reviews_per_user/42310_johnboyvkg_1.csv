The Sound of Music," Get the DVD and listen to Robert Wise's comments
","Watching this movie when I was a young boy still impressed me. I never became a fan of any other musicals of the time, but this film has a good solid story based on truth. It was shot beautifully in both locations and sets.I appreciated even more when I got the double DVD. It was a great film to watch, but then when you listen to Mr Wise's commentary on how the film came together, you really appricate movie making of the 1960's.The casting was excellent. Even for a long movie I never fell asleep which I normal do for films over 120 minutes.There will never be a movie like this again due to the style of the times and will live in my archives forever. Well done!",8,6,16,27 December 2004
