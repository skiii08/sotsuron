Black Swan," huh - what was it
","I have found this movie pointless. I have to give it 3 of 10 just because of acting of Portman and Cassel and some visual aspects. But as a whole it's really just another - in fact really boring - sport movie. This is all the same regardless of kind of sport (boxing, skiing, dancing etc.) - the main figure is struggling her/his own fight of being better. That's it. No more - no less. But in this case it's extremely quasi-intellectual and at the same time sensual and the result is pointless mixture of feelings and no sense of telling this story at all. P.S. I intently do not compare this film with others of Aronofski's creations.",3,1,4,28 September 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," excellent Depp
","I would like to say, that I did not expected anything special from this 'movie of Disney production'. It is not a very best piece of art, but it is piece of art. I think, and I tell it to everybody with which I talk about films, that film is a kind of art. It is in essence a theater piece fashioned with modern digital effects and sounds and music. It is art and it is hard to say, that it is just good or bad. But shortly: this movie is family movie and story is very simple. Characters are not preciously described, but every 'holes' are counterbalanced by Johny Depp's acting (and Rush). Without Depp it would be a little boring movie, but with him it is fun to see it even twice or more. In this category (family 'fairytale' movie) it is very amusing.",7,0,1,29 January 2005
Coffee and Cigarettes," excellent Jarmush ... again
","Well, I think it's obvious that this movie isn't for everyone. People, who don't understand light mixture of strange jokes and very serious themes should not to watch it. I've just read some comments of low ratings and these are of that kind of people. This is very special movie (like Dead Man and Ghost Dog I think) and it is not possible to easily compare it with another movies, especially of Hollywood production. Fot the first sight it is mixture of 11 stories, which are not related of something more than coffee (or tea) and cigarettes, but it is not true. These stories as a whole makes a movie together - it has atmosphere, poetic of its kind and some sense of Sense. I mean sense of what different people think of themselves and what problems they think they have. Strange but very true. And very interesting 'actors' which acts 'themselves'. This is not Hollywood crap. This is simply very good movie.",10,1,3,19 February 2006
Alexander," not the worst but very, really very bad
",after I watched this movie I had to ask: why O. Stone did not make a good movie after Natural born killers? And in the first place: why O. Stone did make film about Alexander of Makedonia? I had to answer myself just: Americans maybe see the world by different eyes then the rest of the world. Surely O. Stone does.some notes: This is not film about Alexander. C. Farell perhaps can't act or he had not opportunity. Almost the most stupid idea was that in this movie acts A. Jolie and maybe hundred snakes. This movie is historical incorrect. This movie says nothing. Battles are boring mishmash. The Main characters (macedonian and Greek soldiers) are almost unmemorable. Everybody (everybody!) speaks English. There is no real dialogue. and - This film has no point and no reason.Pity!,2,6,10,16 May 2005
District 9," simple and strong
","Almost perfect mixture of very believable documentary film of sorts and sci-fi action. In the first place it is after very long time very very good movie, which can be sorted to sci-fi category. Everybody must know, that this category lacks quality, I mean generally. But District 9 has the best quality, which crosses every boundaries of category. Very simple and strong story a la Close Encounters of the Third Kind or perhaps Alien Nation, but with clever plot and dialogues. Many moments of reflection on racism and slum problems and finally moral problems of the men as intelligent (generally; I hope) being. I've seen the movie one week ago and I must think about it still - very simple but strong message. I have to give ten.",10,1,5,24 October 2009
Get Out," Why, whyyyyyyy ???
","Hello,
after years (about 7 or 8) I am 'forced' to write somethig. FIlm industry (especially Hollywood) is in some serious trouble. Couple of movies are still good but most isn't - it's fine, maybe we will see something different in the future. But THAT I don't get!!
What is with people consuming this kind of entertainment - really has this bul......t more than 7 out fo 10? OK:
it's not a comedy
it's not a thriller
it's deffinitely not a horror movie
Maybe, just maybe it is a very bad drama with some attributes of other genres picked by someone with very crude taste and shameless impudence of stealing bit by bit pretty much everything from other movies. And the saddest of all is: its genuinely boring and predictable.",1,0,0,16 May 2020
Thor," pretty enjoyable
","I'm positively surprised. But I want to react to some reviews which bear to consideration some of creators of this movie and their links to 'comics' movies. This is not comics. And I believe, that people who don't know pre-Christian German mythology and never read at least some stories of Edda will not really understand. Story is surprisingly good and this is what I value. The choice of actors is questionable, especially Hopkins and Portman but it is question of personal taste maybe. If there was less Hollywood chliches and more work on details, it would be almost unforgettable. These flaws make this movie - I have to admit - some kind of comics - this is shame. But if you don't expect great piece of art it's very good pastime.",8,0,1,28 September 2011
