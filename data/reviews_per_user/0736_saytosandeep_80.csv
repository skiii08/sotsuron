The Devil's Advocate," MY REVIEW: The Advocate of Antichrist!!
","This movie can't be fit in single genre. It is drama, thriller, fantasy, horror and many genres in one. That's where it scores, it keeps you surprising every now and then by not following rules. The whole idea of a hot shot lawyer having Satan as his new boss is winner. The great Al Pacino gets himself to play a ruthless Antichrist and Keanu as lawyer does good. Both leading ladies Connie Nielsen and Charlize Theron look ravishing and act very well. On imagination front movie scores big time but it losses you where it goes over the top in the climax and does not provide all answers in the end. Movie is fast paced giving you little time to breath through and there is lot of not so required on your face adultery. All in all, if you are looking for a thriller drama that is imaginative by a distance then your search is over.",7,1,2,17 February 2014
Despicable Me 2," MY REVIEW: A Despicable Experience for DM1 Lovers!!
","Despicable Me 2. After the high popularity of wonderful Despicable Me, it was expected that they will push the envelope again but disappointing that sequel was written and directed just to cash in the charm of original's characters and lovely minions. After Gru has turned good, writers just do not know what he shall do. New villain and side characters are so one dimensional and boring. Only real fun you have is from minions. It just lacked the sharpness of original. If you haven't seen the original, you might like it but for who have seen the original and adore it are just going to feel that huge potential was wasted. I am going with generous 7 out of 10 for Despicable Me 2. It's not great fun like the original but not a complete let down either.",7,0,0,10 April 2014
Vertigo," MY REVIEW: Height of Hitchcockian Experience
","Vertigo. Yet another Alfred Hitchcockian experience that keeps you dazzled throughout. James Stewart playing an ex-detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson has fear of heights. He is requested by one good old friend to follow and watch his wife's abnormal behavior at times. Doing so, John gets dangerously obsessed with her and things starts to complicate. Movie is like a ticking time bomb, keeps you puzzled, revealing important twists time to time. Like any other Hitchcock work, here you feel and live what characters feel and live. James as the lead actor does an astounding job. Kim Novak is gorgeous and magnetic as Madeleine Elster but somewhat mechanical as Judy Barton. But Vertigo is not without its flaws. Other than lead characters, people keep disappearing just like that from the plot, like Kim's husband and James's friend. The whole focus is on James and his fear of heights. Going towards end, movie heightens the suspense but leaves you with a heartbreaking climax that somewhat lessens the overall impact.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Vertigo. It is controversially one of the best of Hitchcock but it is still way ahead in its genre.",8,2,3,12 July 2014
Changeling," MY REVIEW: Hope is Everything!!
","Changeling. Never start a fight, but always finish it. Christine Collins played by terrific star actor Angelina Jolie lives these words when her only son goes missing and police tries to fit an impostor as her missing child. She faces the insensitivity of LAPD, fights against it and dares to go extra mile for justice. The movie stands tall with best work of Clint Eastwood who bring out the very best of Angelina Jolie and gives you a delicious cocktail of mystery, emotions, crime and drama. Angelina Jolie in her best form makes you root for her character. The detailed period setting of 1930s, neat characterizations and screenplay flooded with carefully written dialogues are a treat to enjoy. Clint might have chosen the thrilling pace for this chilling true story but he intelligently chooses the slow and absorbing approach to take you through the trauma that Christine experienced. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Changeling. Watch it for its inspiring struggle for justice and stellar performance of Angelina Jolie.",8,0,1,7 May 2014
Men in Black 3," MY REVIEW: Funny sci-fi with heart
","The movie starts as just some funny sci-fi but once the charming actor Will Smith has started his time-travel, there is no looking back. Like the first two, again the soul of the movie is chemistry between Agent J and Agent K even when Tommy is not playing the Agent K. As expected there are lots of funny aliens, lots of witty one-liners and more than expected jokes on blacks involving Will Smith. The evil guy is mysteriously funny. Climax is imaginative and heart rendering. New character Griffin also provides the useful edge to the time-travel idea. If you are looking for a funny thriller then this one is good choice for sure.",7,1,2,26 May 2013
Frost_Nixon," MY REVIEW: It's Just You and Nixon
","Well, the plot suggests it is a drama of capturing a wrong doer politician off guard by a brave talk show host but what it turns out to be how the wrong doer chose not to escape the controversy. In fact our hero the interviewer David Frost has very few moments of heroism. From start to finish, it is the terrific performance of Frank Langella as the controversial president Richard Nixon, delicious dialogs and a neat and engaging screenplay. Other supporting characters are also well developed and provide the ample support on the base of strong acting to the overall drama. Being based on true incidents, the plot and story can't be commented on. All that can be said is that it is very well dramatized for a movie experience.",8,1,1,2 November 2013
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," MY REVIEW: The Game Getting Riskier and Funnier!!
","Sherlock Holmes, in his second outing played by the Robert Downey Jr. who like an old wine is getting better and better with time and his side kick played by charming Jude Law take on their fiercest adversary, Professor Moriarty played creepily by Jared Harris. Guy Ritchie in his second outing, gets under the skin of Sherlock and his sinister world better than the first time and gives you the show of wit and action that keeps you awed during the whole run time. Action scenes like one in the train and one in the jungle are done exceptionally well. The bromance between Sherlock and Dr. Watson holds the movie together overshadowing all female characters what so ever. The story holds many surprises and keeps you engaged till the end. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. If you liked first one, this one is a bigger treat for eyes, ears, mind and heart.",8,1,3,22 March 2014
3:10 to Yuma," MY REVIEW: Ride This Train With Low Expectations!!
","Having Russel Crowe as bad guy and Christian Bale as good guy and putting them in single frame almost whole of the running time does raise your expectations for a western crime thriller but this one leaves you underwhelmed because of few unconvincing twists in the story. Plot is simple, broke Christian Bale gets the paid job of delivering criminal Russel Crowe to a prison train to Yuma while Russel's wild friends are after them . Whole plot revolves around how they influence each other throughout the journey. Tight direction, confident performances, stylish western atmosphere makes for a cinematic treat until in the last half an hour, the change of hearts become unconvincing and director look confused how he should end all this chaos. So low down your expectations and you can enjoy big actors in a compelling crime drama.",7,0,1,20 November 2013
Skyfall," MY REVIEW: Bond Goes Sky High!!
","Although I did not like the storyline personally as it was over sentimental and too personal for professional characters like M, Bond and Silva but no shame in admitting that giving the driver seat to Oscar winning director Same Mendes did wonders to this already cult bond franchise. He took the cheesiness out, made you root for the characters, gave back story to central characters, provided the uneasy darkness and all this is done with lots of conventional bond style and technical excellence. All conversations are so delicious that you want to hear them again and again. Daniel Craig in his third outing as James Bond never misses a beat and his scorching screen presence is worth of your ticket money. Javier Bradem as lunatic bad guy is a treat to watch as usual (Remember No Country For Old Men). Bringing Ralph Fiennes adds the extra intensity and hopefulness for upcoming bond outings. Even with average storyline and bond not actually going for some big threat to world, this Skyfall takes bond legacy to sky high.",7,1,4,9 November 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," MY REVIEW: Extra Love from Outer Space!!
","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. I will say it is extra cute, extra sweet and extra lovely. E.T. the alien lands into the house of little sweet kid Elliott played by terrific Henry Thomas who lives with his mother, big brother and cute little sister played by Drew Barrymore. Elliott and E.T. become pals until their bond is tested by a group of scientists who are obviously interested in studying E.T. Steven Spielberg treats it as children movie but with state of the art special effects and directorial depth, here is too much to enjoy for adults as well. All interactions between E.T. and kids are super funny, Expressions of little Drew Barrymore are priceless and emotional bond of E.T. and Elliott is electric and full of heart. Movie never seems to be in hurry and gives you ample time to enjoy and absorb the sweetness of living a kid's fantasy. So don't waste time, find it and enjoy this special masterpiece of Steven Spielberg.",8,1,2,2 March 2014
Gravity," MY REVIEW: The Gravity of Visuals!!
","Gravity is Life Of Pi of 2013. It's a story of survival, courage and human fighting spirit in the endless darkness of space. Like Life of Pi, 3D and CGI here are not just to make more money. The state of the art technology is being used as the storytelling tool and to make your experience immersive. Every frame is picture perfect and the excellent use of background score, camera work, acting and dialogs make most of the scenes memorable. Sandra Bullock as the central character does the astounding job and George Clooney provides the much needed lightness to the otherwise tense plot. There are numerous scenes which will stay with you especially the ones where our helpless characters struggling to stabilize in the gravity free world of space. It's not a perfection of story telling rather it is the perfection of cinematic techniques that make Gravity extraordinary.",8,2,4,11 October 2013
Se7en," MY REVIEW: It will be Eighth Sin not to Watch This!!
","Se7en. An unpredictable serial killer plot, the great storytelling of ace director David Fincher, performed by always reliable Morgan Freeman, star actor Brad Pitt and if it was not enough Kevin Spacey who does not how to do bad acting, all these give you one of the darkest and chilling thriller of all time. From the word go, you find yourself solving the case with two detectives played by Morgan and Brad. At one moment, they are very near to solve the case and then everything is turned upside down with a heartbreaking climax. Another movie that comes this close to perfection in serial killer plots is another David Fincher classic Zodiac. Gwyneth Paltrow as Brad's wide does well in her small part and provides lightness to otherwise heavy setup. Se7en although questioning the morality still maintains the good side of morality. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Se7en. You will enjoy it best when seen in total silence or undisturbed environment. If you love to be thrilled, then don't miss it!!",8,1,2,16 April 2014
Fight Club," MY REVIEW: Join the Club!!
","Fight Club. Starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Edward an insomniac office worker looking for a way to change his life crosses paths with a devil-may-care soap maker Brad and they form an underground fight club that evolves into something much, much more. It's not an easy movie, it's dangerous, brutal, confrontational, a satire on modern life, brilliantly acted, packs hell lot of clap worthy one liners and above all has a distinctive tone to himself that you can't take your eyes off even for a second. Director David Fincher quite clearly understands when to go fast, when to pause so that you can enjoy the delicious scenes. He takes you through a thrilling roller coaster ride with an array of crazy characters in crazy places and in crazy circumstances. I personally did not like the way it ended but that's just a nitpicking. Don't Miss It!!",8,0,0,13 January 2014
12 Monkeys," MY REVIEW: The Time Travel Mystery
","Don't go by the title, it's not about animals. It's a pure science fiction based on the concept of time travel. The idea here is complex and even execution does not try to make it simpler for you. You need to provide your full attention to it in order to understand the sequence of events and correlate them to unsolve the mystery. The lead actors Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe play their part with perfection but it is Brad Pitt who steals the show with his portrayal of a maniac. The screenplay is water tight and background score is first-rate. There are lots of interesting conversations over understanding of human psyche. You would not like to miss it if time travel fantasies intrigue you.",8,1,1,9 September 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," MY REVIEW: Special space travel!!
","I am not a Star Trek follower, but I liked the reboot of Star Trek by J.J.Abrams and based on the good-will of first one, went to watch the sequel and I was not disappointed at all. The sequel has all the good part of first one and adds new characters and drama with ease. Chemistry between Kirk and Spock remain electrifying. The visuals remain with you especially if you have watched it in 3D. Dialogues are filled with humor. The movie starts in 5th gear and then pace never drops. The characters are well developed and their conflicts are believable. The movie can seem to be a bit long and heavy on eyes but if you are looking for a spectacle of high standards with right amount of action, fun and emotion then Star Trek Into Darkness will take you to the light.",8,2,7,26 May 2013
Troy," MY REVIEW: War of All Times!!
","Troy. If once I do not delve into how correct was the movie, this is one of my favourite war movie. Troy scores by a distance on visuals of ruthless and massive war and over the portrayal of great warriors like Achilles and Hector played by almost equal charisma of Brad Pitt and Eric Bana respectively. I can watch the combat scene between Achilles and Hector a hundred times without blinking my eyes. The mutual respect that great warriors show to each other forms the soul of the movie. Orlando Bloom depicting the weakest character in the movie falls flat and is the only weak spot in otherwise strong casting. Even after being more than three hours long, movie never seems to be running out of steam. It gets better in second half before shattering your hearts in the climax. Troy is one of those massive film making done without use of CGI. The cinematography, photography, costume design, set design, everything is first rate. I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for Troy. Despite its flaws, it is one of the finest war drama shown on celluloid.",9,2,3,18 April 2014
Zodiac," MY REVIEW: The Puzzle of Zodiac
","A cartoonist, a news reporter and a police officer get obsessed with the crime investigation of serial killings and killer calls himself as Zodiac. From the take one to take last, the movie works itself as chronicle of the actual investigation. The ace director David Fincher tells the story with the help of supremely talented actors playing the lead characters and the done to death details of the investigation. At many points, you would like to pause, rewind and play back so that you do not miss the clues to catch the Zodiac. Just like the lead characters, you are bound to get obsessed to catch the Zodiac. I surely got obsessed as I am writing this review at 03.20 AM in night just after finishing the movie. You can't afford to miss this amazing crime drama.",8,0,0,20 September 2013
The Prestige," MY MOVIES: Nolan's Magic!!
","The Prestige. Every magic trick has three parts. The pledge where you show something ordinary, The Turn where you make that ordinary thing disappear and The Prestige where you make that thing appear again. Without The Prestige, a magic trick is worthless. On the same line, Nolan's magical movie works. He starts you showing few ordinary humanly characters, surprises you with its twists and turns of the story and then leave you speechless and awed at the end.Centred around the professional and personal rivalry of two magicians played by charismatic Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, The Prestige is a genius work of Christopher Nolan. With its non-linear story telling, he keeps you glued to the show of magic and life of magicians. With is period setting, great visuals, delicious dialogs and top notch performances by its lead and supporting actors like Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, Nolan creates a feast of cinematic magic.There are hardly any loose ends and revelations at the end, even if you saw them coming much earlier are great enough to leave you impressed. What also works in favour, that it is a mind bender and you might like to revisit to enjoy it more and more.I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for The Prestige. As it is said in the movie, people love to be fooled in this otherwise simple world, The Prestige is nothing less than a great magic trick played in front of you leaving you smiling and clapping at the end.",9,2,3,15 November 2014
The Adventures of Tintin," MY REVIEW: The Adventure is Out There!!
","Tintin, the name we are familiar with but never know much about him. Legends like Steven Spileberg and Peter Jackson club together and start a new animation franchise The Adventures of Tintin. The first outing is directed by Steven himself. So what is it that makes Tintin movie special? I will say it is the state of the art animation made with the help of motion capture technology, the relentless action drama and detailing which will remind you of Indy movies. Movie never tries to be utterly funny like other animations around; it keeps itself serious about its mission and succeeds by a margin. Although Tintin himself is not a funny guy but his pet Snowy and ally caption Haddok provide enough fun moments. Lack of any female character does not bother. So if you liked Indy movies or Pirate movies then it will sum both of them for you in animation format. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Adventures of Tintin. There is sequel planned and this time Peter Jackson will be taking the command and we all know how much Peter loves adventures.",8,1,3,15 March 2014
Fast & Furious 6," MY REVIEW: The Sixth Gear of Fun and Action!!
","Furious 6. Made on a story that can be detailed in single line 'Hobbs has Dom and Brian reassemble their crew in order to take down a mastermind who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries.' Furious 6 is a mad enjoyable watch or some sort of guilty pleasure. Lack of a thrilling storyline is covered by grand canvas, ruthless action, races and chases, peppy background score, man on man fights, woman on woman fights, cars against tanks and even planes. Some action scenes go over the top and you need to avoid applying logic every now and then to enjoy the sequences. All actors play their part OK and their conversations are mostly laced with delicious one liners. So, Furious 6 delivers what it promises, fasten your seat belts and enjoy the ride.",8,5,8,7 February 2014
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," MY REVIEW: Run Farhan Run!!
","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works for two basic reasons. One it is based on the story of a sports person whose personal life is dramatic enough to keep you engaged apart from its racing track achievements and second it is played by Farhan Akhtar who plays his role as if he is really Milkha Singh himself. Farhan Akhtar excels playing Milkha Singh like Ben Kingsley excelled playing Gandhi. Farhan Akhtar seems to be enjoying every bit of the movie. When he runs, he runs like a tiger. When he dances, he dances like a pure Punjabi. When he loves, he loves with innocence and passion. Farhan Akhtar can easily be given all best actor awards of 2013. All supporting actors give their best. Divya Dutta is excellent, Sonam Kapoor looks fresh, Pawan Malhotra and Parkash Raj's performance are heartwarming. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is first rate and awe inspiring. Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra like an expert captain provides movie its uniqueness, technical perfection, soul and purpose. Like an every fantastic experience, this also comes with its dull moments. Movie takes around extra half an hour before reaching to its finale. Rangrezz song could have been avoided and prolonged sequences of Milkha's achievements could have been shortened. Dilip Tahil playing Pandit Nehru looks like a missed stroke. At the end, you can safely say, you had a great time running with Farhan Akhtar for more than 3 hours. Run to your nearest theater now to watch this powerful biopic.",8,44,57,12 July 2013
Alien," MY REVIEW: The Horror Started Here!!
","Alien. The first alien horror from able hands of Ridley Scott back in 1979. Long duration scenes, chilling silence, neat characterization, haunting back ground score, few surprising twists and state of the art special effects. All these convert a conventional looking survival story into a magnetic thriller. It is termed as sci-fi but I would say there is less science and more fiction here. Sigourney Weaver who have acted in all alien movies is the leading lady here and does the fantastic job in making the character worth rooting for. But all credit goes to Ridley Scott for clean and sure footed direction and the special effects team for the work that does not seem dated even after 30 years. Must watch for sci-fi or horror cum thriller lovers.",8,0,1,14 October 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," MY REVIEW: Captain Leading from the Front!!
","Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. Sometime it does not matter much if your leading superhero is not throwing one liners one after another like Iron Man or has enormous amount of power like Thor or has delicious anger issues like Hulk, because Captain America is our pure old school hero who will talk no non sense and won't accept lies and at the same time he is irresistibly good looking and carries his shield like a medal for himself. All this provide Captain America a distinct identity in Marvel Cinematic Universe. To balance the fun, beautiful Scarlett Johnson playing agent Natasha, her boss Nick Fury played enjoyably by Samuel L. Jackson and loyal sidekick to captain played by charming Anthony Mackie provide enough jokes. To complete the story, we have a ruthless mercenary The Winter Soldier who is amazing with the mask but surprisingly average without the mask. Movie takes its own sweet time before starting the action in full blow when Nick Fury is attacked by the evils. Action scenes are full of well edited man to man fights and climax is overblown much in the lines of The Avengers. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is a blast for MCU fans and must try for superhero lovers.",8,6,12,4 April 2014
Interstellar," MY REVIEW: Stellar and flawed!!
","Interstellar. It is hard not to expect anything but the best when you are watching a Christopher Nolan movie. After all, he has earned this high level of expectation from his every movie. Interstellar, is his most ambitious work. When other film-makers try to make you believe that there might be other planets for us to live, Nolan goes two steps further and show you such three planets. This movie is a grand cocktail of science fiction, human emotions and their never ending survival instincts. He succeeds big time except for the middle portion involving character of Matt Damon. If you can forgive Nolan for this, then Interstellar is one of the rare cinematic experience that will be cherished forever. Nolan deliberately avoids CGI and that's why all the special effects feel so real. Performance wise Matthew McConaughey is more than brilliant and keeps you glued to the screen. Second best are the robots which are simple and more humane than humans in the movie.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Interstellar. To Nolan, you want to give a perfect 10 for his ambition and fearlessness. Like Spielberg, he is bound to go into history as most influential film maker for current and coming generations.",8,2,8,9 November 2014
Pacific Rim," MY REVIEW: Big Action in Big Pacific
","Pacific Rim. I was not very interested in it after watching trailer. I thought it just looks like another action packed CGI movie on big creatures like Transformers and I am happy I proved myself wrong by giving it a try. Yes it's like Transformers where everything is too big to fit in even IMAX screen but treatment is where it scores. It doesn't take too much time to make a plot for its big action sequences. The threat is there from the very first scene, where Kaijus (An Asian legend on the lines of Godzila) can vanish the whole human race. So humans created big robots Jaegars operated by two pilots at a time to fight them and the whole movie is about how it all ends. The whole movie is so much fun to watch that you feel like a kid enjoying WWF fight on big screen. The whole movie is another excellent example of CGI visuals and creatures and it gets even better with immersive 3D experience. Characters and twists are predictable but they are never overdone. Dialogues are funny at times. Performances are average. All in all, you won't like to blink throughout the movie because you don't want to miss the punches Jaegars make to Kaijus. I hope there will be a sequel to it because this effort needs to be rewarded.",8,6,11,18 July 2013
Gone Baby Gone," MY REVIEW: Moral Ambiguity!!
","Ben Affleck might not be the actor you look forward to but definitely he is the director with deep knowledge of its subject. The movie starts as mystery, soon becomes emotional crime drama and ends as a food for thought. The moral ambiguity that movie aims is very well depicted through its characters and leaves you asking for, did he make the right decision? Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's brother) is credible as private detective. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris provide right amount of punch. The movie grows on you scene by scene and in its finale it tears you apart. It touches the level of perfection in its final minutes, most movies dream to.",8,0,1,1 October 2013
Rush," MY REVIEW: Rush for This!!
","Rush. Based on real story of rivalry between two F1 drivers of 70s, dashing James Hunt played by 'Thor' fame Chris Hemsworth and clinical Niki Lauda played by incredible Daniel Brühl.Like a F1 race, Rush is also a racy drive with lots of bends in the story testing the lead characters' spirit and temperament. Both lead characters are so well developed and well played that they leave an indelible mark on your minds. Director Ron Howard masterly organizes a wonderful show of technical finesse, sharp dialogues, uncluttered screenplay and cinematic thrill of F1 racing. The love-hate-respect relationship between James and Niki is electric and every now and then you feel the adrenaline rush that they are feeling. There is hardly any dull moment and emotional conflicts revolving around the love lives of both the racers is handled with a light hand so that you are never distracted from the main plot. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Rush. This is one of the best sports movies in recent times and will surely get a cult status in future. Rush for this.",8,1,1,1 January 2015
Léon: The Professional," MY REVIEW: Intelligent, Emotional and Intense!!
","Leon. A professional assassin rescues a young girl whose family were killed in a police raid conducted by a corrupt police officer. Girl teams up with the assassin to take the revenge. Now, the assassin here is 50+ played by famous Spanish actor Jean Reno, the girl is in her teens played by Oscar winner Natalie Portman and police officer is Gary Oldman who always enjoys himself so much when it comes to negative roles.Leon's strength lies in the unusual cracking chemistry between Jean and Natalie. Natalie wears her role so well that it's very difficult to take your eyes off. The scenes of Jean training Natalie the skills of being an assassin are laced with witty humor. The neat, uncluttered and linear screenplay helps movie's emotional strength so that you can absorb the feeling of the characters to the fullest. Gary Oldman gets lesser screen time than expected but does an astounding job as heartless corrupt police officer. Only false note that seems to be here is not showing is how Gary manages to run his evil business and gets full military support in the climax to take down one man and a girl. Action scenes are very well done and do not try to over shadow the emotional and intense undercurrent that flows in the story throughout.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Leon: The Professional. Watch it for its apt cast, great acting, super dialogs and highly emotional, intense, beautiful and subtle moments.",8,2,2,13 July 2014
Burn After Reading," MY REVIEW: Laugh While Watching!!
","Guy 1 is fired from his job. Girl 1 the wife of Guy 1 does not like it and is already cheating on him by having affair with Guy 2. Guy 2 is also dating one other Girl 2. Girl 2 and his friend Guy 3 find something worth blackmailing Guy 1 for the sake of some quick money. Guy 3 is accidentally killed by Guy 2 in the house of Guy 1 and everything gets messed up. There is also a Guy 4 who is boss of Girl 2 and Guy 3. Guy 4 actually likes Girl 2 a lot but she never sees it. Guy 4 also gets involved in the whole mess. If all this sounds interesting to you, then Burn After Reading is a treat to you because it is packed with witty funny dialogs, unmatched performances and tight execution by Coen brothers. What movie only lacks is the logic that does not seem very important as whatever is happening is just a farce anyway. So sit down, relax and enjoy the ride with talents like George Clooney and Bard Pitt who strangely don't have a single dialog between them in the whole movie.",7,0,0,30 November 2013
The Thing," MY REVIEW: The Scary Thing!!
","The Thing. Sounds scary, right! Yeah, it is scary, mysterious, thrilling sci-fi horror classic. The plot is one liner, scientists in the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people that it kills. The special effects are perfect and have not dated at all even after more than 30 years. It builds the tense atmosphere from the very start and helped by hell like stormy chilling weather of Antarctic and thunderous background score. All actor act well and Kurt Russell as lead does his job right. There is loads of blood bath and brutal killings by the scary thing. The open ending takes the movie out of ordinary and leaves you wondering why there is no sequel at all of this classic? Nevertheless, until they could think of worthy sequel, enjoy this timeless sci-fi horror classic.",8,3,5,19 January 2014
21," MY REVIEW: An Easy Number Game!!
",21. It is the fact-based story about six MIT students who were trained to become experts in card counting and subsequently took Vegas casinos for millions in winnings. First lack of money drives characters to do something insane and then abundance of money make them insane. Genius and selfish Professor Mickey played by master actor Kevin Spacey and simple sober smart student played by Jim Sturgess both are the strength of the movie. Supporting actors also do OK. Movie aimed at youthful emotions in an easy ride never getting dark or overly emotional. The big guy Laurence Fishburne playing the spoiler in the otherwise a foolproof plan makes his character quite enjoyable. I am going with strong 7 out of 10 for 21. If you want to enjoy an easy ride which does require your mind to read the game then 21 is right one.,7,0,0,15 March 2014
The Exorcist," MY REVIEW: The Mother of Exorcism Movies!!
","The Exorcist. The cult 1973 movie is the mother of all movies made over the same subject over the years. Why it stands apart? I think because it treats its subject and characters with utmost sincerity and care. All characters ranging from the possessed girl, the helpless mother, the saviour priests and even the demon himself have been sketched with high level of detailing and given the back stories so that you care for them. Scenes involving demon torturing the possessed girl are terrifying and leaves you haunted. The conversations between devil and the priest are delicious to listen. The movie talks about possession and exorcism in so much detail as if you are watching documentary on this subject. Acting by all lead actors is top notch. The movie requires your patience in first half an hour but then there is no letting back as unpredictability takes center stage and you are glued to the screen to know how it will end. Movie succeeds in ending the horror in satisfactory manner. For all horror movie lovers, don't miss it!!",8,4,7,16 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," MY REVIEW: Days Worth Rememebring in Future!!
","X-Men: Days of Future Past. Arguably the best of X-Men series, not because it has every good thing we know X-Men for but because it manages to make a delicious cocktail of those good things and even makes you to think about watching the whole X-Men series from start to finish so that you can enjoy their journey to this future. Ranging from hugely popular Logan/Wolverine played by rough and tough Hugh Jackman, Mystique/Raven played by gorgeous and talented Jenifer Lawrence, Charles played by charming James McAvoy, Eric played by cunning and edgy Michael Fassbender and a long list of mutants played by credible actors is the whole and soul of this X-Men extravaganza. And if these were not enough, you have Quicksilver making his debut in a wonderful cameo during a critical prison break scene. I am sure Quicksilver will be next big things in Marvel's universe. Action set pieces are innovative, uncluttered and mesmerizing. Based on time travel theory, although movie does not quite exploit it fully but that's just nitpicking in otherwise two exciting hours of action and fun. Days of Future Past is a well wrapped gift to X-Men fans from Bryan Singer. I am going with strong 8 out of 10 for X-Men: Days of Future Past. It reminds you the wonderful fun of X-Men 2 and X-Men: First Class and lets you forgive the shortcomings of other X-Men movies.",8,1,2,28 May 2014
Independence Day," MY REVIEW: Super Disaster Fun!!
","Independence Day. Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow, 2012) just loves the idea of extinction of humanity so he keeps on showing us different ways of having it happened. Here, one alien race threatens the earth at their face to kill all humans in one shot. The movie works big time because it enjoys this idea to the core and then finding the solution in more enjoyable manner. The characters of the American President played by subtle Bill Pullman leading humans from the front, the smart scientist played by charming Jeff Goldblum finding the unbelievable crazy solution and terrific fearless military man played by unmatched Will Smith put up a great show of heroism and courage apart from the amazing special effects done all the way from start to finish. You just feel amazed watching the whole New York going ashes, Will Smith's plane being followed by the alien one and the priceless visual of huge spaceship almost covering the whole city. In one line, if you have purchased a state of the art home theater system with one big projector screen then this movie should be the first one to enjoy.",8,0,1,23 February 2014
Gone with the Wind," MY REVIEW: Going to Live Forever!!
","Gone with the Wind. Around 4 hours long colorful rich romantic drama on the backdrop of war was made long way back in 1939. At that time it created a havoc at theaters by grossing close to $400 million which is now equal to more than $3000 million. The lead character Scarlett is a rich spoilt manipulative selfish girl in the times of American civil war and meets her counterpart in Rhett another spoilt gentleman who falls in love with her because she is as bad as him. But both lead actors are honest to each other and they have a habit of never quitting even in the gravest danger. The movie is a journey of Scarlett from pre war to post war times in Georgia. She marries two times; once for revenge and once for money before she finally marries to our hero. You must be thinking what good it would be to live through journey of such flawed characters? Well, the fun lies in the well written drama, soothing back ground score, delicious dialogs, colorful rich sets and an array of small but significant characters around Scarlett. The movie never tries to make a point and showcases both selfish and kind characters with equal love. The movie is special because it does not seem dated at all and charms you even after 70 years.",8,1,2,20 October 2013
No Country for Old Men," MY REVIEW: Flawed Perfect Western Thriller!!
","No Country For Old Men. It's a near perfect western thriller gone somewhat wrong in the end. Hero a hunter himself finds a bag full of money from a crime scene but then gets hunted down by a crazy lunatic killer. Adding other dimensions there is aging sheriff trying to help hero without his knowledge. The movie starts and flows like a clean water with edgy characters, tricky situations and some clever ideas. Then when you are all set for bang-bang climax, movie takes a different route, plot becomes ambiguous, motives become unclear and our hero is out of the story just like that. If you are not overly miffed by the deviation in last half an hour, then you would be attracted to this like an iron to magnet because of its crazy characters, witty dialogs, haunting atmosphere and chilling silence.",8,3,4,13 October 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," MY REVIEW: The Charm of Smaug!!
","Peter Jackson never fails to impress. He amazed us with immortal LOTR trilogy and my personal favorite the grand remake of Kingkong. With Hobbit 1, he set the stage for a thrilling adventure and with Hobbit 2 he has raised the bar again by his lucid imagination and magical touches. Like Hobbit 1, Hobbit 2 is also a long tiring journey often testing your patience but your patience is awarded big time when the terrifying fire breathing gigantic dragon Smaug appears on screen and you are glued to the 3D screen like a kid. His interactions with charming Bilbo are delicious. Out of the dwarfs Bombur makes you laugh without a single dialog. Other actors also fit to their relevant roles. But the movie belongs to the Peter Jackson and his technical team for setting up the terrific set pieces like grand water chase, flawless 3D experience and taking you to the world of magic and courage. Purposefully, at least four sequences are being kept open at the end so that you start counting the days for Hobbit finale to appear on big screen. Can't wait to be there and back again!!",8,2,7,18 December 2013
Batman Begins," MY REVIEW: The Greatness Begins!!
","Batman Begins. Who would have thought a dark super hero like Batman will find greatness in the able hands of Christopher Nolan? Nolan combines a young man's pain and hatred against evil with the theatrics of a super hero and he does it so well that you just can't stop watching this trilogy time and again. Batman Begins takes you through the story of how Batman became Batman? Nolan like an expert magician puts on a show that is high quality on all fronts; be it solid acting by Christian Bale playing Bruce Wayne and Batman with equal ease and charisma, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman playing his best no nonsense pals, delicious dialogues and many one liners, haunting back ground score, a mystery always looming around, high octane action and most importantly ideas talking more than actions which is always the case with Nolan's work. Using a non-linear narrative effectively, movie combines childhood, youth and mature age of Batman beautifully and leaves you wanting for more at the end. Katie Holmes as Bruce's love interest looks cute. I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for Batman Begins. If you think super hero movies are just always about having fun, then this one will prove you wrong by a distance.",9,0,1,16 March 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," MY REVIEW: An Exciting Journey
","Peter Jackson's love of using the cinematic power to portray fantasies is not fantasy in itself. As an expert captain, he recruits the talented team, works on his vision tirelessly, uses advance technologies as the story-telling tools and the results are LOTR trilogy, Kingkong and the latest one is part one of The Hobbit trilogy. Being a prequel to LOTR trilogy, few of the characters are familiar and some of the new characters are also memorable. As expected, the strongest part of the movie is the CGI evil characters and the fighting sequences. You might find slow pacing a deterrent but your patience will be rewarded with winning satisfaction. Tip: Watch it only in HD print.",8,2,6,1 September 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," MY REVIEW: Fly with Dragons Again!!
","How to Train Your Dragon 2. Being a sequel of a much loved movie, Dragon 2 walks on the tight rope of maintaining the fun quotient of Dragon 1 and providing some new fresh ideas which can make Dragon 2 memorable. Movie improves in the stunning imagery and usage of 3D effects considerably. Dragons' flight scenes would be hard to forget especially by new kids in the audience. Characterization of humans and dragons both is done with much care. But it is hard to ignore the fact that fun quotient has been lowered and movie takes a darker way in second half in providing few key twists and turns. Burdened by high expectations, Dragon 2 falls short of being a milestone movie but dares to take new chances. The chemistry of our hero Hiccup and his dragon Toothless remains the strength of the story. I am going with generous 8 out of 10 for How to Train Your Dragon 2. It has its flaws but is very well saved by excelling in visuals and characters department. Watch it in 3D for full impact.",8,3,8,15 June 2014
The Pianist," MY REVIEW: Music of Pain!!
","The Pianist. Much like any other movie on time of Hitler and his hatred towards Jews, The Pianist is a painful watch of torture and inhumanity. Unlike Schindler's List which was a movie on the German Saviour, The Pianist is a movie of the Jew victim, a piano player played perfectly by Adrien Brody who survives the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto of World War II. The Pianist's strength is authentic portrayal of the war time, the plight of the Jews in Poland and how our pianist keeps surviving the odds of the highly difficult times. Apart from that, the whole destruction scenes in second half are perfectly haunting and leave you with pain and sorrow. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Pianist. It is no Schindler's List but in its own world, it is the haunting tale of war times.",8,0,0,9 November 2014
Drive," MY REVIEW: A Subtle Drive!!
","Drive. A mysterious Hollywood stuntman, mechanic and getaway driver played by over good looking Ryan Gosling lands himself in trouble when he helps out his neighbor. Our hero won't say much, instead he would just smile and smile and so his love interest played by cute Carey Mulligan. Music takes the center stage in this crime drama and subtlety takes over the passion, anger and desperation. That's the story till mid point because in last half an hour, you are shown loads of blood-bath but never the justification of it. Like our mysterious lead actor, for me movie was a mystery in which there was no mystery at all. So if you are not looking for surprises, then it is fine piece of action crime drama and makes a good watch for a holiday.",7,0,1,18 January 2014
Frozen," MY REVIEW: The Adventure of Visuals!!
","Snow was never so visually appealing until I saw Frozen; The Disney's modern masterpiece from the world of musical animation fairy tales. Fearless optimist Anna teams up with Kristoff in an epic journey, encountering Everest-like conditions, and a hilarious snowman named Olaf in a race to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom in eternal winter. Like the stunning visuals, characters are also sketched with love, dialogs are funny, music is mesmerizing and lyrics are worth recalling. The scene where Elsa designs a palace for herself is spellbinding. This is one of such movies for which you would like to step into the theater so that you can capture those gorgeous visuals in your eyes for eternity. Storyline is magical so is the narration. As the snowman Olaf says 'some persons are worth melting for' I can say 'some movies are worth enjoying ever'. Frozen is one such movie. Don't miss it!!",8,0,3,6 February 2014
Schindler's List," MY REVIEW: Top Most on the List Of Fav Movies
","There are good movies, fantastic movies, mind blowing movies and then there is Schindler's List. It tells you the story of the time of holocaust during World War II and how one businessman Oscar Schindler (played by terrific Liam Nesson) becomes concerned about his Jewish work force after witnessing the massacre. It's black and white except the one last scene because there was no point of using colors till that point. It shows we the people can be nice and can be evil without giving a thought to the reason. It is as graphic as it can be while showcasing the horrors of war. You need to be really stone hearted if not moved by this emotional, horrific portrayal of war times. Ralph Fiennes as ruthless German and Ben Kingsley as Jewish business manager of Schindler's factory give knock out performances. But the movie belongs to legendary director Steven Spielberg's unmatched skills of directing the whole story with such uniqueness and conviction that is hard to believe. Schindler's List surely tops my list of top movies.",9,15,23,26 July 2013
Dog Day Afternoon," MY REVIEW: A Crazy Day!!
","Dog Day Afternoon. Based on a real incident which happened in Brooklyn, New York, Sonny played by the acting maestro Al Pacino robs a bank to pay for his lover's operation; it turns into a hostage situation and a media circus. The whole story claimed to be real always seems so unconvincing like hostages playing with the gun of Sonny, public cheering for Sonny, cops never seem too serious about the situation and so on. But what keeps you glued till the end is the unpredictable nature of events and remarkable performance by Al Pacino. His expressions, dialogs and whole persona is just irresistible. Supporting actors; John Cazale playing the eccentric crime partner and Charles Durning playing the brave cop who has to negotiate with Sonny before FBI takes over do their part quite right. Sidney Lumet tries hard to keep you engaged but story losses its juice because of lack of back story and a rushed climax. Nevertheless, watch it once for its unpredictability and Al Pacino's powerhouse performance.",7,0,1,9 March 2014
The Game," MY REVIEW: Play This Game with Caution!!
","The Game. A gripping mystery with the victim of the dangerous game played efficiently by Michael Douglas keeps you on the edge throughout the run time except the last five minuets. For every great mystery, it is must to get you surprised in the end by a distance but here the apple just fell very far from the tree. For obvious reasons I can't tell you why I felt cheated at the end, after all it is a mystery. Smooth uncluttered narration done with haunting back ground score with lots of twists and turns makes you feel intrigued. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for The Game. I could you have given it a perfect 8, but you know the ending, huh! Anyway, play this game any time with Michael Douglas giving his best and let me know how did you feel about ending.",7,0,0,20 April 2014
Gran Torino," MY REVIEW: The Last Man Standing!!
","Gran Torino. Disgruntled Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski played by director-actor the old school champion Client Eastwood sets out to reform his neighbor, a Hmong teenager who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: a 1972 Gran Torino. The plot is simple, narrative is straight, drama is deep, emotions are heavy, dialogs are witty and message is huge. All in all, from the word go, you are glued to last days of Walt and how he bonds with his Hmong neighbors and how it affects him and others. Clint Eastwood never misses a beat playing the on your face last man standing. His interactions with ladies around him are much funnier and deep than his main ally the Hmong teenager. The only false note in this class act is the ending of his interaction with young priest who is awaiting for Walt's confession for so long. Nevertheless, the out of the box climax leaves you so much to think about what you will do in similar situation. So watch it because it is witty, funny, emotional and quite a manly movie.",8,0,2,2 March 2014
No Man's Land," MY REVIEW: literally the piece of international cinema
","Lagaan lost to this movie at Oscars because it is more impactful, with authentic feel and literally the piece of international cinema involving characters across borders that even can't understand the language of each other but have to do their duties in the name of war and peace. The movie is a satire, making you laugh most of the times and making you feel sorry for the characters at the same moment. The chats between the three trapped soldier is skillfully written and narrated. The movement of the single gun between the two soldiers are the most smart parts of the movie. At the end, movie hits and disturbs you in the most unforgettable way.You will end this movie thinking, even the wars are just a big joke for us.",9,1,2,17 November 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," MY REVIEW: The Amazement Continues!!
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I always find Andrew Garfield (smart, witty and funny) and Emma Stone (beautiful, smart and charming) better replacement to Tobey Maguire (a bit dull) and Kirsten Dunst (nagging and crying). These two make whole and soul of Mark Webb's version of Spider-man engaging and more enjoyable. Whenever you see these two leads sharing scorching chemistry, the screen just lights up. This movie uses the advance technological geniuses in Spider-man's flight scenes and action scenes and awesome 3D adds icing to the cake. Dane DeHaan as Green Goblin or Harry Osborn gives a chilling performance and he will be the one to watch out for in next movie in the series. But this amazing experience does not end on a high note. Last 20 minutes into the movie and you are given as many as three climaxes to absorb. Jamie Foxx playing Electro is not given right finish. Rhino makes a very late entry. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Amazing Spider-man 2. Despite its over stretched climax, this one makes a terrific superhero movie experience because of its casting and enjoyable characters.",8,2,9,6 May 2014
Back to the Future Part III," MY REVIEW: The Time Travel Adventure Ends So Well!!
","Back to the Future Part III. And then I was finished with one of the longest time travel fun ever. Starting from the point where Part I and Part II finished, Part III takes you this time to the old west era of 1885. You might think how many ideas they have up their sleeves to make us laugh, you will be surprised to see they have never run out of ideas while making this totally coherent screenplay that can be fit in three movies rather single one. Most of the laughter comes from how to make time machine work in the technically backward 1885. Michael and Christopher playing Marty and Doc respectively are still at their best. Dialogues like 'Great Scott', 'That's heavy' and 'I am back from the future' remain with you. Doc's expressions whenever he hears about scientific innovation of future are priceless. His subtle love encounter is cute and lovable. I suggest you watch this trilogy in one go and I bet you must not have laughed so much for 6 long hours. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Back to the Future Part III. It ends but it ends so well that you will feel like that they have just started.",8,3,4,16 March 2014
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," MY REVIEW: Really Good Night and Good Luck
","The movie is directed by acting powerhouse George Clooney. Shot in black and white to match the times of black and white era of 50s, the movie is an insight into the world of real journalism which has lost thereafter in 24 hrs of circus show where reporters shout to make a point to which nobody gives a damn. The movie is no nonsense drama of how one aggressive reporter takes on a senator who believes shadow of Communism will kill America so every person who has the history or present connecting to communism beliefs should be called as threat to the security of nation. George Clooney gets the best of the performances possible especially by his lead actor which makes this drama so compelling. The movie is equipped with acidic dialogs and camera-work is first rate. Must watch if political history drama interests you!!",8,0,0,17 August 2013
Mulholland Drive," MY REVIEW: Crazy Drive!!
","The movie has run for more than 1.5 hours. There are lot of scenes that do not make sense or don't seem to be related to each other. You think it is some conspiracy or supernatural element behind all mystery. And then movie turns upside down to you. What is revealed is unthinkable. I felt happy I did not know anything about the plot before watching it because it could have spoiled the surprise. All I can say is that it stands with the movies like Memento which show that human brain or human psyche or human imagination is far too complicated to understand than we think. Driven by terrific performance of Naomi Watts under the splendid direction of David Lynch, movies leaves you with a lot of doubts and questions. I can bet, you would jump to reading blogs once you are finished with it so that your questions are answered and you can sleep peacefully. Watch it first to get surprised and then again to understand it.",8,0,0,27 October 2013
The Hangover Part II," MY REVIEW: The Hangover Once Again!!
","The Hangover Part II. You know the drill, it follows the same template of cult The Hangover. This time it is Stu's wedding and they are lost in the sin city of Bangkok. Like last time Doug is missing during most of the screen time but this time he is not the missing one from the wolf pack. Instead of Alan, Stu gets the center stage and his pain and sorrow is quite inevitable. Bradley Cooper looks cool and plays the guy with a mind quite good. Alan as usual get most of the funny lines and weird emotional scenes like with criminal Chow from first movie and a smart monkey who smokes. Movie gets over the top and overly crass in its humor sometimes but I think director never promised a clean humor anyway. So if you are watching it with your wolf pack then it is a blast just like The Hangover otherwise it is just the rehash of the same formula that made The Hangover so much enjoyable.",7,0,0,2 March 2014
Prisoners," MY REVIEW: Puzzling Desperation
","Prisoners. It's a slick dark crime investigation thriller raising few questions on moral ambiguity. The theme is based on kidnapping of two small children in a small town where police fails to make much progress and a parent takes matters into his own hands. Like Ben Affleck's smashing debut Gone Baby Gone, the movie's journey is about putting the pieces of clues together and in parallel questioning how much evil you can become to counter the evil? Lead actors Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhall give their best and supporting actors provide nice support. Movie takes the conventional route of a crime drama but it's the unsettling intensity in atmosphere through grey background and chilling performances that keep you puzzled in a good way from start to finish. Like other classic crime thrillers, it asks you to provide your full attention and makes you discuss it more and more long after the movie has ended.",8,1,1,29 September 2013
Elysium," MY REVIEW: Elysium is Worth Visiting Once!!
","Elysium. Director of cult District 9, an interesting idea, big actors like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, great looking visuals and sci-fi gadgets, all these raise your expectations to sky high. Elysium fails to meet these high expectations because Jodie Foster is wasted completely and Matt Damon's character despite all his powers does not come across as big hero who saved your world. Technically, Elysium is class apart with very good use of new ideas on future weapons and machinery but when it comes to drama and thrills, movie somewhat lacks the sharpness needed for a serious science fiction. Sharlto Copley as menacing sleeper agent Kruger does well but his character is given a bad turn in last few reels. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Elysium. Despite its many flaws, it makes a good watch any day because of its spectacle of high standards.",7,0,1,28 April 2014
Avatar," MY REVIEW: Avatar of New Generation of Movies!!
","Avatar. For those who live movies within their hearts, they won't deny that Avatar is not just a movie. It's an event in the journey of movies. It's a big cinematic leap. It stands tall with movies like LOTR or Gravity or Batman movies. All these movies have one thing in common, they urge you to come out of your houses and enjoy cinema on giant screens. Even when you are watching these movies at home again and again, they just light up your TV screens and you are glued to them like kids. James Cameron's technical team's shining portrayal of planet Pandora , so many CGI characters having the soul of real actors, relentless action and drama make Avatar a highly enjoyable movie. The lead actor Sam might seem slow or boring but his honest sincerity as Jake Sully is unmistakable. All other supporting actors also give their ample support but it's only and only James Cameron's unexplainable vision that makes you sit through the event called Avatar. Now he has announced Avatar 2 and 3, I know he won't let us down. After all, he gave us Aliens, Terminator 2 and Titanic.",9,2,3,1 March 2014
Saw," MY REVIEW: One of its Kind!!
","Saw. The cult gory thriller from James Wan is a pioneer among movies which rely on gory visuals while creating suspense or tension. It is damn good fun while it lasts.The strength of Saw lies in its twists and turns that keep you hooked throughout and imaginative uniqueness of execution from James Wan. Pacing is fast, color tone mostly black and white, characters are twisted, acting overall good enough and length perfectly short of less than 2 hours. If you are seeing it first time, it has enough to startle you but given the disturbing images you might not like it to revisit. I am going with strong 7 out of 10 for Saw. It is something special in horror genre but only for those who do not mind their cinema dark, twisted and disturbing.",7,0,1,15 November 2014
Mama," MY REVIEW: Oh, What a Waste of Potential!!
","Mama. Created as long feature film from a short Spanish film, Mama has everything that a horror movie asks for. Kids as the central characters so that you always want them out of danger, terrific atmosphere, a chilling mystery and few endearing supporting characters. Still movie never succeeds in pushing the envelope and fails to exploit its potential. Jessica Chastain a rock band member who is given the difficult task of caring about two little girls does good and holds the movie together. But movie belongs to little girls; elder one bridging the emotions of real and super natural world and younger one who enjoys a comfortable relationship with her ghost care taker. First half is good, raising doubts and questions and having few scary moments but second half fails to raise the stakes and summing up the story in a chilling manner. Showing the ghost doesn't work here. I am going with not bad 6 out of 10 for Mama. It could have been much more but restricts itself being a run of mill horror flick.",6,1,1,16 March 2014
3 Idiots," MY REVIEW: Non-Idiotic Bollywood Feel Good Fun!!
","3 Idiots. The greatest director of recent times shows that cinema is magical. He shows, you can club the mainstream masala in a purposeful film flawlessly. All you need is directorial excellence and magical touch of Rajkumar Hirani, supreme performances by as many as six actors in a single movie; Aamir Khan, R Madhwan, Sharman Joshi, Omi Vaidya, Boman Irani and Kareena Kapoor, a story that touches all generations especially youth, a water tight screenplay which feels like a roller coaster ride of fun, emotions, pain, drama, thoughts and new ideas. There are numerous outstanding scenes especially the comic ones. Music might sound a bit below average but in movie it is used intelligently and never holds the fun for you. All in all, it is simply no nonsense Bollywood main stream cinema which serves the masses and classes with equal ease and love.",9,0,1,27 November 2013
Pulp Fiction," MY REVIEW: Delicious QT Work of Fiction!!
","Pulp Fiction. It's not your ordinary movie, it defies the conventions, it is an experiment which became a style of film making. It does not respect the silence, it fills the empty spaces with long and irrelevant but delicious conversations on hamburger, foot massage, act of God etc. Narrated in non-linear or should I say circular fashion where first scene and last scene meet each other at the end and there are scenes between them that define the whole story. There is a whole array of quirky characters played by wonderful talents like Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman. The screenplay is filled with unpredictable events, surprising coincidences, characters who are not related to each other but impact each others lives significantly. So much like Sin City and Fight Club, Pulp Fiction is a unique and amazing experiment of film making that is destined to be studied forever. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Pulp Fiction. More likely, at first viewing, you won't be able to understand this movie's purpose but after repeated viewing you would appreciate the fact that there was no purpose at all.",8,0,2,20 April 2014
Psycho," MY REVIEW: Welcome to the World of Alfred Hitchcock!!
","Psycho. It has been more than 50 years now when this Hitchocokian piece of amazing cinematic experience was first shown to the world and it has not dated at all. A chilling story, watertight screenplay, detailed narration, solid acting, subtle conversations and on top of it the magical touch of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock did not need gore or violence to spook you, he did it with just creating the creepy atmosphere and giving you scares at the right moments. Janet Leigh as the victim of its own actions and Anthony Perkins as the mysterious guy give you chills now and then. There is hardly any unwanted scene and Hitchcock makes you root for all characters including the evil ones. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Psycho. This is my first triumph with Alfred Hitchcock's old world of black and white gems and I am sure I am going to dive deeper and deeper.",8,0,1,13 April 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," MY REVIEW: The Hunt Worth Finding!!
","Zero Dark Thirty. Not sure why it is titled that but anyway it is the chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and his death at the hands of the American military in May 2011. From the word go, the movie takes you to the hunt, importance and desperation of it. Here the lead character Maya played by terrific Jessica Chastain fights fire with ice but in few scenes her outburst gives you the goosebumps in this thrilling chase. In last hour or so where they believe that they have located their man, movie converts into the one of the most thrilling and realistic missions showcased on celluloid. On the flip side, I kept waiting for some back story of Maya to know why she is like that. Even though I felt that they just got lucky in finding Osama Bin Laden and some sequences were over simplified, there is no denying because of this movie I was able to experience the most important man-hunt of recent times. Don't miss it!!",8,6,11,18 January 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," MY REVIEW: Nest or Cage?
","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a hard movie to judge. It's not the conventional drama of good versus evil. Writer never tries to establish any character as good or bad, instead he leaves it to the viewer to decide. Whole movie is set in a mental institution where our hero enters, break the conventional rules and all hell break loose finally. The climax leaves you in a bitter sweet taste and you can't escape from the questions it raises to you. Movie is slow paced, takes its sweet time before action starts. It's the Jack Nicholson's finest acting show that keeps you glued to the screen. Lousie Fletcher plays the Jack's counterpart of hard faced rule book following nurse quite competently. All other supporting characters are also well developed and play their part to the perfection. It's not the storytelling or drama that leaves you spell binded but it is the emotional depth and the soulful characters that leave the lasting impression on you. Not to be missed for whom who like the cinema to be unconventional.",8,1,3,9 November 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," MY REVIEW: Wolf of Film Making!!
","The Wolf of Wall Street. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, whenever they are together, you know you shall be ready for a cinematic treat and The Wolf is no exception.Playing a morally wrong character, Leonardo DiCaprio displays best of his acting skills. His performance in each and every scene is so animated and delicious that you may like to rewind some of the scenes just to enjoy them again and again. Martin Scorsese like a master of his game never let the intensity go down. Supporting actors like Jonah Hill and special appearance from Matthew McConaughey are icing on the cake. Screenplay is full of surprises and dialogues are sharp.Like Goodfellas, The Wolf is seen from the eyes of the wrong side and keeping everything authentic and comic works big time for this movie.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Wolf of Wall Street. It is one hell of an entertainment for three hours.",8,1,2,9 November 2014
Ice Age: Continental Drift," MY REVIEW: Drifting the Fun Away!!
","Ice Age 4 was obvious to arrive after Ice Age 3 was accepted universally as the funniest in the series. But that's where the problem starts. Ice Age 4 is adventurous like its predecessors but not funny like Ice Age 3 nor subtle like Ice Age 1. Most of the new characters fall flat and most of the situations are pretty predictable and pinch like clichés. It's not like everything was bad. Granny character was funny and complimented our adorable and crazy Sid. There are fun moments too but only here and there. It felt like the lead characters are getting tired of these adventures so is the loyal audience. Even the most liked character Scratte did not have enough fun this time. If they are thinking on Ice Age 5, I just hope they reinvent the series with some original idea.",6,0,0,5 October 2013
The Wrestler," MY REVIEW: Wrestle With Life!!
","The Wrestler. A faded professional wrestler, aptly cast and sincerely played by Mickey Rourke, who must retire finds his quest for a new life outside the ring a dispiriting struggle. The first half of the movie gives you insight into the life of wrestlers and tells you the show might look fake but performers are not fake. They are humans like us, they get hurt real bad, physically as well as mentally. Second half focuses on Mickey himself as he tries to fit in his life without wrestling. It is not an inspiring tale but a really gritty one for sure. The wrestling scenes are done in detail and leave a lasting impression of pain on you. However, movie gets a bit depressive and dark as we proceed towards the painful finale. Marisa Tomei lends heavy support in her role of Mickey's love interest. All in all, if you enjoyed those funny looking wrestling on TV screen then this might just change your view and take them a bit seriously.",7,0,0,2 March 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," MY REVIEW: Middle Earth Saga Ends and Ends Well!!
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The master of his craft, Peter Jackson bring the finale of the Hobbit trilogy and as expected, he stuns with his command on visuals, cinematography and creation of memorable characters and action set-pieces.Movie starts right in the middle of action where last movie's star Smaug the dragon is furious and firing all over the city. As movie moves forward, the danger keeps on rising and you are well treated with slick one hour long CGI based detailed battle of the five armies. This is shortest and most action oriented movie among all middle earth movies so there is not a single dull moment.You might find it underwhelming when compared to LOTR trilogy but it is still a satisfying finale. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Hobbit 3. If you are not a fan, you will be entertained and if you are a fan then you will feel sad because the saga of middle earth movies spanned over 13 years has come to an end.",8,3,8,19 December 2014
Halloween," MY REVIEW: Horrific Halloween Night!!
","Halloween. The cult horror from 1978. It might have been one of revelation in its days because of its tone, background score and the idea of scare being personified so diligently but I think it had dated pretty fast because of absence of a puzzling screenplay. In a short run time of 91 minutes, nothing much happens in first 60 minutes apart from the first scary scene at the very start of the movie. You just anticipate that it is going to be chaos soon. It happens but then things get wrapped up pretty fast. At the end, you feel like movie has just started scaring you and this should have been the interval time rather the end itself. Nevertheless, it makes a nice watch because of its idea and relating the every scare to the day of scares i.e. Halloween.",7,0,1,23 February 2014
Back to the Future Part II," MY REVIEW: The Time Travel Adventure Continues!!
","Back to the Future Part II. And the adventure of time travel ranging from 1955 to 2015 continues. The movie was made in 1989 showing us how earth would be in 2015. Being in 2014, you can't stop yourself comparing that whether they got it right or not. Imagining that by 2015, there won't be any lawyers, justice would be served in 2 hours or so, there will be flying cars everywhere makes you think we are progressing at much lower rate than we could imagine. Marty and Doc find themselves screwing the time lines, creating alternate realities and obviously responsibly fixing the faults made. Despite sitting on a technically confusing plot, writer and director never let things go overly complicated by explaining things in simple English and keeping excellent humor alive and kicking. Peppy instrumental back ground score running almost every second enhance the drama and urgency beautifully. Despite being a sequel to a cult out of box movie, movie succeeds surprising you at many junctures and wherever screenplay crosses with the screenplay of part I, you can't stop yourself saying WOW. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Back to the Future Part II. I do not recall any other science fiction being so much funny.",8,2,3,16 March 2014
The Wolverine," MY REVIEW: The Wolverine Once Again
","The Wolverine. Our hunk Hugh Jackman starring as Logan in its 6th outing still carries his charm as he carries his claws. This time he is in Japan saving his new Japanese lady love from ninja warriors. Set in dark set pieces, first half has little to offer to excite the audience except for the fight cum survival sequence on a bullet train. But second half quickly joins the missing pieces giving the movie its purpose and Hugh Jackman some scenes where he can be punch the bad guys with charming arrogance. The twist in the end is good but doesn't hit you hard. Overall, it won't disappoint Wolverine fans but it lacks the fun that we have whenever Logan fights the bad guys with his fellow mutants. To keep the excitement alive, there is one post end credits sequence hinting about the new threat for X-MEN.",7,0,3,31 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," MY REVIEW: The Rise of Batman Trilogy
","The Dark Knight Rises was always a risky movie because it's a sequel to most respected superhero movie till date i.e. The Dark Knight. The new villain Bane is no Joker but Batman, Bruce Wayne, James Gordon and Luscious Fox are the same celebrated characters of Nolan's Batman story. Movie starts on a shaking ground with more talking and less action but second half gets the things on track and grand finale including the epilogue take the movie out of ordinary. New characters Miranda Tete, Selina Kyle and Blake gets their part right. However the end of the evil characters looks too rushed, but it's just nitpicking in otherwise the high quality spectacular entertainer. As an audience, you finish the movie with mixed feelings because it is an end to an extraordinary trilogy but Christopher Nolan knows that ending it will make this trilogy immortal.",9,3,6,21 September 2013
Monsters University," MY REVIEW: Good Monsters!!
","It's hard to review a pixar movie. The benchmark is set too high that you don't expect anything but the best. MU suffers from the same kind of expectations that pixar fans carry with them. No doubt, movie is nicely built college rivalry story with some funny moments, some heart rendering moments. But this is not enough for pixar fans. Movie has conventional treatment and very few funny moments in first half. Most of the fun is generated by how monsters carry themselves as if they are humans. Second half is much stronger with supporting characters providing lots of fun, movie not following the usual underdog's story pattern and lead characters getting enough screen time alone. At the end, you won't be able to say that it is The Incredibles or Up in the series of pixar movies but it is definitely Brave or Monsters Inc.",7,0,1,22 June 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," MY REVIEW: The Puzzling Love!!
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Woody Allen never fails to surprise us while showcasing the little complexities of being in love and here he does it in pure Woody Allen style. Story is about two polar opposite friends who fall in love with same man over their trip to Barcelona but they don't know that his ex-wife is about to enter into the already complex equations. Supported with subtle and good performances by an A-list cast ranging from Rebecca Hall playing Vicky who likes to keep life simple, Scarlett Johansson playing ever confused Christina, Javier Bardem playing the womanizer Juan and terrific Penélope Cruz playing his crazy ex-wife. Two things that will remain with you after the movie has ended; First Penélope Cruz nagging in Spanish and Christopher Evan Welch's voice as narrator that keeps you awed while explaining the mood swings of Vicky and Cristina. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Vicky Cristina Barcelona. It's a nice sexy little cracker in Woody Allen style.",7,1,2,23 March 2014
Thor: The Dark World," MY REVIEW: Thor Lights Up Again!!
","Thor is charismatic, ideal, no nonsense superhero as evident in his first outing played by Chris Hemsworth. In his awaited return after The Avengers, he takes the legacy further. His loved one is cool Jane Foster played beautifully by talented Natalie Portman. But the most lovable character remains his cunning, clever, cool, likable evil brother Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. In fact he is my second favorite villain after Joker of The Dark Knight in todays superhero universe. Visual effects vary from fantastic to excellent to mind-blowing. Stakes are much higher this time, but movie never tries to take them too seriously. In fact there are lot of funny situations and one liners but this fun was overdone in the messy climax. Nevertheless, it is a fun ride during which you would like to enjoy lots of popcorn. Please note that once movie is over, wait, there will a mid post credit scene to give you a clue for Avengers 2 and one at the very end showing the actual last scene of the movie.",7,1,5,12 November 2013
Happy New Year," MY REVIEW: Happy But Nothing New!!
","Happy New Year. After debacle called Tees Maar Khan, Farah Khan teams up with Shahrukh Khan again and result is similar to their last venture Om Shanti Om. Happy New Year makes you feel happy but there is nothing new or fresh about it.Fortunately movie has a plot to talk about where a team of losers led by Shahrukh himself plan a heist while faking themselves as a dancing group. Movie has its moments because Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone has got a knack for comic timing and their characters make you chuckle. Farah Khan in her usual spoof style film making creates few moments of laugh as well as irritation.Shahrukh Khan is here in his comfort zone but an actor like him should aim much better at this stage of his career. Sonu Sood seems pretty uncomfortable in comic avatar. Boman Irani is competent as usual. Movie is around half an hour extra long. The first hour could have been easily trimmed for more impact.I am going with not bad 6 out of 10 for Happy New Year. If you don't mind brainless entertainers in the name of cinema, Happy New Year might satisfy you.",6,4,9,26 October 2014
Godzilla," MY REVIEW: Godzilla Returns Big Time!!
","Godzilla. If you loved Godzilla version of 1998, then this Godzilla will tell you loved a fake Godzilla. In this 2014 version, Godzilla returns in its pure ancient form where he is quite distant in size and behavior from lost race of dinosaurs. This movie works because it's a sincere cocktail of monstrous beasts, their fights, illusion of humans that they can control the nature, heroism of Godzilla, right amount of suspense, drama and emotional connect through well etched characters. First half is a bit slow, takes its time to create the felling of danger but second half makes sure that you do not blink your eyes otherwise you can miss the finest CGI effects done for a monster movie. The noisy roar mixed with emotionless eyes of Godzilla helps establishing Godzilla as the ruthless hunter. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Godzilla. If you are already fan of this monster then you can't afford to miss it. If you are first timer then you would end up being a fan.",8,3,7,21 May 2014
Rockstar," MY REVIEW: one of the most poignant piece of bollywood cinema
","Imtiaz Ali understands the love stories to the core but this time he makes two mistakes; first he casts Nargis who need acting lessons and second he allows his indulgence to allow movie to go for extra half an hour. Don't start thinking, that you should avoid this movie. Imtiaz gives his golden touch to first half of the movie and plays the master stroke by casting Ranbir Kapoor as the central protagonist. Rahman's rocking music and Mohit's golden voice are the integral parts of the story and help the movie whenever direction and editing falters. But above all, this movie belongs to Ranbir Kapoor who gives more than a riveting performance. As J.J he is lovable and as Jordan he is irresistible. He makes you feel the pain of being in love in every scene he is in. The movie is packed with witty dialogues and soulful moments. Far from perfect piece of cinema, this is one of the most poignant piece of bollywood cinema. Go and experience the Rockstar from the hands of Imtiaz Ali who keeps on exploring the different dimensions of love.",8,1,1,17 November 2011
Braveheart," MY REVIEW: The Epic Tale of Bravery and Heart!!
","Braveheart. The Oscar winning war drama acted and directed by Mel Gibson. It is the heroic tale of how a Scottish commoner rebelled against an English tyrant. With a grand canvas, absolute stunning cinematography, a water tight screenplay, very well acted and above all directed with such a passion and courage that you want this tale not to end at all even after the three hours of running time. After an emotional twist in the tale, the movie goes to a very high level of film making in unforgettable last hour of it. It's Mel Gibson's show from start to finish as he acts and directs with full love and understanding of cinema. The war scenes are detailed, uncluttered and mesmerizing. Sophie Marceau as English queen looks beautiful and acts smartly. The camaraderie among Scottish rebels is charming and provides the comic relief. Just like Gladiator, Braveheart is the heroic tale worth revisiting again and again and again.",9,2,4,18 January 2014
Back to the Future," MY REVIEW: Hilarious Time Travel!!
","Back to the Future. Remarkably clever, witty and hilarious sic-fi ever made. When Marty played by adorable Michael J. Fox is accidentally sent 30 years back in time, he needs to make sure his teenage parents fall in love in order to save his own existence. When you go back in time where you were not supposed to be at all, you actions can change the course of your own future. This concept creates lot of hilarious situations and full credit goes to writer-director Robert Zemeckis and his team for consistently imaginative screenplay, excellent music and back ground score, witty dialogs and emotional connect between characters. All supporting actors have done a pretty decent job especially Christopher Lloyd playing the crazy scientist and Crispin Glover playing Marty's timid father. Don't miss this cult sci-fi classic. It is one of those rare clever and really funny comedies.",8,1,2,9 March 2014
The Birds," MY REVIEW: The Wings of Thrills!!
","The Birds. Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is a mystery around a love story and some family drama. It has all ingredients required for a taut thriller but the level of satisfaction at the end might is questionable.The story starts as a typical love story where heroine chases down her hero to far distance in order to win him but gets stuck in his town when mysteriously birds start attacking people. Like a pure hitchcockian experience, there are consistently impressive performances by all actors, beautiful locations, mysterious conversations and delicious screenplay. The scenes of birds gathering before attacking and attacking from unlikely places are haunting enough to give you goose bumps.But The Birds feels like a betrayal at the end. With so much suspense built up in 2 hrs, you feel cheated when at the end no questions are answered and movie ends abruptly.I am going with good 7 out of 10 for The Birds. It is good in every sense but the unquestionable thirst for answers might irritate you at the end.",7,2,4,6 October 2014
