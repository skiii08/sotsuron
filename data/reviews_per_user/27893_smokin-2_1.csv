Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not disappointed at all, definitely a good start to the trilogy
","By far the best flick I've ever seen.  This film has everything for all ages and genre's. Special effects that are best described as amazing throughout the entire film, coupled with fantastic characters. Absolutely the best setup possible for the up-coming films. It was great to see the Jedi in their prime. In 'Jedi' I thought Luke was a bad-a**, but as I see him now as an undertrained Jedi-Knight, he is nothing in comparison to a well trained, from the proper age, Jedi.Although criticism is rampant over this film. I disagree with everything I've heard. This is just the beginning of a six movie series, and should be viewed as such. It is not meant to be complete. It is meant however to be a setup for characters, and plot, and is supposed to leave you wondering about what is to come.",10,0,0,2 July 1999
