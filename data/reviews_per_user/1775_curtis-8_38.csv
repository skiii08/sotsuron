Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Brilliant bits floating in a Bloated sloppy mess
","Quentin's 2-part return to Pulp Fiction Land is a sloppy mess of excess and dead space. The filmmaker has obviously bought entirely into the Boosheet that everything he touches is golden, and therefore he cranked out two bloated flicks instead of one good one. It's as though he figured, Why wait until the 2-disc Special Edition DVD to show my fans all the parts I cut out in order to make a single, coherent, compelling film--I'll just leave every little thing I shot in right up front! Or perhaps the Weinsteins figured two new Tarantino flicks would make more than one, seeing as how it takes him so long to crank one out these days. In either case, I was sporadically entertained by the two films, but annoyed and saddened as well, because I could see a really great film hiding under all the excess footage and slop. Quenting needs to grow up and realize that Jackie Brown was by far his best film--because it had a story! Quentin has good stories in him, too--he just doesn't have the guts to tell them anymore when he knows all his fanboys really want is violence and pop culture references.Sad.",Null,1,3,4 June 2004
Minority Report," Nothing Special; Slick but Full of Holes
","I wasn't much impressed by 'Minority Report.' There really wasn't a lot that was new or all that complex. Or perhaps there had been at one time before the script was 'Spielberged.' Seemed soft to me. The technological advances envisioned didn't seem much more impressive than those in 'Back to the Future 3.' BUT what bugged me most were the many glaring lapses of logic, and one in particular that will necessitate a SPOILER to explain (below).OK, Cruise is on the run--formerly a government cop, now a wanted man, considered a top criminal by the all powerful government. The most common means of identification in the future (apparantly)is the retinal scan. Everything requires a retinal scan. They always know what you're doing and where you are via the retinal scans of your eyes. SO, Cruise has his eyes removed and replaced in order to make it harder for the government to ID and find him by a retinal scan. Got that? OK. Now, after his eye transplant, Cruise wants to sneak back into his old super-secret, high security government controlled lab. So, what does he do? He brings his original eyes with him in a jar and uses them in the retinal scanner in order to get entry.DID YOU GET THAT?Do you get how stupid that is? HE HAD HIS EYES REMOVED FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF NOT ALERTING THE GOVERNMENT TO HIS WHEREABOUTS WHEN HE HAS TO USE A RETINAL SCANNING DEVICE!!! I MEAN, HAVING DIFFERENT EYES WAS THE WHOLE POINT--WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF HE'S CARRYING THEM IN A JAR OR THEY'RE STILL IN HIS SKULL? IT'S THE STUPIDEST THING EVER!DON'T YA THINK THE POWERS THAT BE WOULD HAVE REVOKED HIS SECURITY PRIVALIGES ONCE HE BECAME A TOP CRIMINAL? Or, at the very least don't ya think that once the retinal pattern of the most wanted man in the country showed up on the grid that the omnipotent government would then rush to the scene?It's this kind of complete disregard for even the simplest logic that convinced me that Spielberg needs to just stay away from Science Fiction all together. All in all--very slick, but also very sloppy. Closer to Jurrasic Park 2 than Close Encounters.",5,1,3,18 August 2005
Monster," Reality?
","I loved Monster and thought Charlize Theron's performance was the best I'd seen in a film this year. But I wanted to comment on something. Much has been made of Theron's makeover from gorgeous glamour girl to wasted alkie white trash prostitute. True, she and the filmmakers did take a bold chance in transforming her. But they sacrificed a lot of 'realism' in the casting of sexy Christina Ricci as the young lesbian love interest. I've seen photos of the real 'Selby' and she resembles the gigantic, one-toothed, pinhearded character Sloth from The Goonies much more than she does the delectable Ricci. Of course seeing a dressed-down Theron and a big ugly goon making out would not be as a big box office draw as Theron and Ricci as lovers.But it would have made for a much more 'real' film.",Null,0,1,29 February 2004
Inglourious Basterds," Interesting, but not the 'New Dirty Dozen' action film its advertising purports
","'Inglourious Basterds' is an interesting film, but not really a satisfying one. It has the ideas and framework of a cracking 1960's style WWII action spectacle, along the lines of 'The Dirty Dozen' or 'Where Eagles Dare,' (Or even Italy's 'Inglorious Bastards' from which the new film gains its name). But the long sequences that make up IG are really more like outtakes from a Hollywood film. It's as though Tarantinio is presenting the conversations that happened in the big budget 1960s WWII action epic when the camera wasn't on. In that way, it is actually much more like his first commercial feature 'Reservoir Dogs'--long dialog sequences punctuated by violent outbursts; all surface style, no deep characterization; incredibly entertaining dialog, but way too much of it, etc.I had very high hopes after the first sequence, a very skillful lift of the prolonged yet tense opening sequence from Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West.' But I was soon to find out that the film was just going to be one such sequence after another, each less effective than the last simply due to the repetition. There were no real themes developed, the Basterds (except for Pitt's cartoony 'Psychotic Andy Taylor') were basically faceless and uninteresting, and the whole thing was unfocused and unbalanced. But even so, the dialog scenes were entertaining while they were taking place—it's just that they served absolutely no other purpose than momentary amusement. It would have been really cool if Tarrantino had collaborated with someone who could have integrated the best of his conversational sparring sequences into an actual story.",6,5,12,14 September 2009
Underworld," Kate+Skintight Black Leather=Good Fun (with the Volume Turned Down)
","UnderworldIf watching Kate Beckinsale run, jump, strut, pose and fly across the screen wearing a skin-tight black leather outfit sounds like a great way to spend two hours of your time--and it does to me, I tell you what--then 'Underworld' is the best film ever made. That's because Kate's leather-clad form and pale, gorgeous face is about all the entertainment value there is in this incredibly derivative Goth-kid's wet dream. 'Buffy,' 'Matrix,' 'La Femme Nikita,' Neil Gaiman, and Anne Rice are only a few of the sources blatently 'resourced' for this over-budgeted hunk of junk.If you don't find the vision of Ms. Beckinsale's hide-wrapped hind quarters enough to interest you for two hours, however, all you have left is incredibly bad dialogue, overripe sets left over from other, better movies, and a bunch of lank-haired wannabe rockstar pretty boys glowering and acting all testy.  Luckily, now that the movie has been released on home video, you can turn the sound down and at least not have to suffer the inane sub cartoon dialogue. In fact, 'Underworld' would have worked much better as a silent film.  Fortunately (or sadly, depending on how you look at it) I find Kate's patent leather packaged butt to be plenty entertaining all on its own, however, so I have to give the flick all thumbs up!",Null,1,2,27 May 2004
This Is the End," Good Concept, Some Good Jokes, But Not Really a Movie.
","This is the End plays less like a real movie and more like the longest video ever featured on Funny or Die. Imagine if Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd had played themselves in Ghostbusters, add in a TON of dick jokes, toss in the inspired Danny McBride, remove virtually all plot, reduce the maturity and intellectual levels of the all-male thirty-something cast to that of 15 year old virgins--and you've got this movie. There are a lot of good ideas here, but this is strictly first draft stuff. Rogan and company should have worked with a REAL screenwriter who could give the movie a real story and help to flesh the characters out a bit (I mean, are we really to believe that not ONE of these successful GROWN UP male comic actors has a wife or girlfriend? That THEIR ONLY relationships are with each other, like they are all 15?). This is the rare occasion when at least SOME studio intervention would have helped, as Rogan is apparently too inexperienced a story teller to know what to keep and what to toss.The middle sags especially, with one disconnected, overlong improvisation after another doing little more than filling time. Only Danny McBride really excels at this type of thing, and he's kind of the 'Richard Pryor in Silver Streak' element in this--not really the star, but easily the most memorable player). The offhand comments by Rogan and Craig Robinson are funny, but are better used to complement actual dialog, not replace it. And the over-reliance on this kind of dick-joke mumblecore is what almost kills the movie. But if you're a huge fan of even half of these guys, the movie is worth it. I watched many a bad flick back in the old days just because it starred John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Cheech and Chong or one of the Monty Python gang. But this should have really gone the direct-to-video fans only route.",5,2,6,24 June 2013
The 13th Warrior," Why is the Arab there?
","Is there anybody who's seen this movie who hasn't wondered why Antonio Banderas' Ahmed character is included? In Michael Crichton's novel Ahmed is the narrator, and the entire first half of the story involves the educated Arab's reactions to the ways of the dirty, loud, warlike Vikings. Now I'm not saying that the 'fish out of water' plot is original--but at least it gave the narrator a reason to be in the story. How can the relationship between Ahmed and the Vikings be explored if we have no idea who he is? For some reason the filmmakers decided to skip over any details of Ahmed's background or character, only sketching them in the bare bones during the credits. So what we get is just a fairly decent, and fairly dumb, B-movie Viking adventure story with an Arab in it for some reason. I mean, for all that money, why bother? Still, it is a better Viking movie than Lee Majors' 1978 b-flick 'The Norseman'. Barely.",Null,0,0,28 August 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun, but with a distinctly modern lack of clarity
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' is fun, but it is Johnny Depp's great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow that holds the thing together, not any skill in storytelling on the part of the filmmakers. You have to see this thing twice to understand the convoluted plot and a good four or five times to even catch on to many of the poorly presented running gags (how long did it take you to get the 'wooden' eyeball gag? Be honest). I'd bet my life savings that not a single person who saw this movie 'cold' (without reading a plot summary first) understood what the f was going on until they'd discussed it with someone or seen it again. The screenplay is partly to blame, continually doling out necessary information well after we would have really cared (Oh, THAT'S why they kidnapped Keira Knightly--wish I'd known that half an hour ago). But even though the story is convoluted in a way that only contemporary movies seem to manage, the problems aren't necessarily with the script. This same screenplay could have been filmed and all the story points and gags could have been made crystal clear without changing a word. The main problem here is that we have yet another TV commercial/music video director who has been given the reins of a huge-budget flick without ever having proved he/she can actually tell a story. The director here does put some great images up on the screen, and a few very good bits of business make it as well. But fun performances, great set design, great sfx, make up, etc don't add up to a great movie if the story is incomprehensible. And it's not just the story as a whole I'm talking about, it's tiny bits of storytelling that fail, like the previously mentioned wooden eyeball joke. This director does not know how to visually emphasize the proper elements to tell a visual story. All he is capable of is making it all look either pretty, or loud (or both). And I'll give this to the director--he does get the look of a pirate movie right. SO, annoying as the directorial shortcoming are, the film still ends up being fun. But it could have been SO much better in the hands of a director more experienced in storytelling.",Null,0,2,27 December 2004
Spider-Man 3," Would have been better as 3 separate movies
","The individual parts of Spidey 3 were very well done. Overall, I was entertained, but the whole thing did seem more than a bit disjointed and cobbled together. It took forever to get going and the three main story lines didn't really mesh at all until near the end--and even then, the convergence of the three was clumsily handled.It was as if they made three really, really good episodes of a Spiderman TV show, each with its own story arc, and then forcibly edited the them all into one feature film. They used to do this with popular TV shows like 'Man From Uncle' and 'The Virginian' back in the 60s.As I watched the story lines of S3 slowly unfold I couldn't help but think that each of them--the Sandman's story, the New Goblin story, and the Venom story--was being shortchanged, and that each would have been better if filled out to about an hour and a half on its own. But when a flick costs about a quarter of a billion bucks, I guess they think you should get at least three movies worth for your ticket money--but I'd rather pay three times and get three really good movies instead!",7,0,0,21 May 2007
Cloverfield," Weak, Weak Flick--On the Level of a Sci-Fi Channel TV Movie
","'Cloverfield' is a very weak movie no better than your slightly above-average Sci-Fi Channel Original Made-For-Television monster movie. It has so much in common with that kind of stuff--the bland, sub-par, no-name young actors; the same bland, lackwit dialogue; the same lame, clichéd, tacked-on love story; and the same halfway decent, but barely-glimpsed CGI monsters. The ONLY thing 'Cloverfield' had going for it was the gimmick of telling the story through the 'eyes' of a camcorder--and they blew that entirely. For that gimmick to work, you'd have to totally commit to the concept--ie, exactly what would this kind of thing look like if captured by an amateur with a camera? And this is the part at which the screenplay, producer, and the director totally fail. They mistake shaking the camera around for 'realism.' But 'realism' is the exact opposite of the effect that the direction and camera-work of 'Cloverfield' convey. The movie is supposed to look like someone shot this with a hand-held vidcam, but what it actually looks like is a movie shot by a guy wearing a camera on his head like a hat. 'We see what he sees' is not what you would get if the cameraman is holding the camera in his hand. You'd get that only if he's holding the camera up to his eye for 90 minutes straightall the while running from a big monster, fighting off smaller monsters, climbing across debris, and jumping from one building to another. And he never drops the camera (though it does hit the ground a couple of times, though that's only because the guy holding the camera hits the ground. And the camera never breaks! That is some great damn camera! Must have a 'super-grip' handle and be virtually indestructible! I want one!).But that is not the only way that 'Cloverfield' totally blows its own gimmick. The filmmakers also decided to put their little camcorder in the hands of a guy who, even though he is supposed to be a complete regular-guy dumbass, apparently has an innate gift for pointing said camcorder in exactly the right direction needed in order to catch each bit of clichéd dialogue and each clichéd reaction to said clichéd dialogue.The people who made 'Cloverfield' took a really lame giant monster story, cast it with your typical young Soap Opera actors, and knew that they would have to depend entirely on the 'shot from someone's vidcam' gimmick to give the thing its oomph and interest. And they half-assed it all the way.The trailer we all saw last summer was much more entertaining than the finished product.",2,5,12,22 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Best Animated Film of the Year!
","I'm not really being a smartass when I say that 'Episode II' could qualify as the best animated film of the year. I feel that one of its major flaws is that it has people at all! Honestly, pay attention to the parts with actual humans in them--the actors in Lucas' film stand out against their computer-created environments almost as obviously as the ones in 'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad.' Well, maybe I'm being a little bit of a smartass by claiming 'Episode II' could qualify as the year's best cartoon--the computer environments and animation really aren't even as convincing as those in 'Stuart Little.' This is mainly due to overkill--I mean, there wasn't a single 'set' in the film that wasn't absolutely massive. Distractingly so. And when Lucas' characters are replaced, in long shots, by computer animated versions of themselves, they move in that unnaturally smooth, underwater way that computer-game characters do (also one of the few flaws in this year's 'Spiderman'). This lack of 'flesh actor time' is no huge loss, however--Hayden Christiansen and Christopher Lee give the only real performances in the movie, anyway.On the positive side, even though the backgrounds are invariably busy and distractingly mammoth, the actual action taking place is wonderfully easy-to follow. Lucas' simple editing and framing, influenced by action serials of the 1930s and 40s is a refreshing change from the incomprehensible action sequences in recent action flicks like 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.' For the most part, Lucas just pulls back to a medium shot with the major participants in full view, and has them do their (often computerized) thing. If only he could take a lesson from himself and simplify his epics instead of making them ever larger and more scattershot. He needs to pull in the reins on the FX department and concentrate making movies instead of big-screen, non-interactive videogames.",Null,0,0,29 May 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," Let the 'Roger Moore' era of Bourne begin!
","The Bourne series has often been called the James Bond of this generation. Well, if that is so, the franchise has, with 'Ultimatum,' hit its 'Roger Moore' years. The action sequences are outstandingeverything else is poorly acted, poorly written, idiotic crap. I thought the scenes in the super-secret CIA subgroup's control center were some of the most ludicrous I've ever seen in a big budget movie. I thought the overwrought, ultra-clichéd, sub-Chuck Norris dialog was going to kill me! The CIA guy in command, David Strathairn, is constantly yelling out ridiculously obvious orders like 'I want to know everything about this guy before he even knows it!' as though his team is doing this for the first time and doesn't know what they're supposed to do. And, even though these CIA spooks can apparently see anything they want on video at any time anywhere from the comfort of their secret lair, and even though they can put any number of operatives on the ground anywhere they want at a moment's noticethey still lose a key suspect they're tracking when Bourne tells the guy to STAND BEHIND A BUS. No, I'm not kidding. And there's also an inexplicable (and inexplicably stupid) sequence in which Strathairn (I hate to keep picking on him, but he was saddled with most of the idiocy) barks at his operatives in the secret command center to show him records with photos of the contents of an apartment that has been searched. What they show him are not scanned images or individual items, or anything like that, but photos of documents that have just been dumped in a pile at random. But lo and behold, they happen to see the info they need peeking up from behind some other papers! Wow! What luck. What dumb, dumb luck.And the stupidity isn't limited to the CIA, either. Mr. Super-smart Bourne also has to depend on clues like file folders that have gigantic red stamps on them that read 'CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: TOP SECRET!'. I mean, reallyis there anyone above the level of an 8th grader who actually thinks the government puts big red stamps on their secret stuff? Is that what you do with stuff you don't want others to see, put a huge red sign on it that says DON'T LOOK? However, the action sequences were outstanding. Too bad the people behind the series have taken out all the brains.",2,1,5,17 March 2008
Cold Mountain," A Great 45 minute movie with an outstanding supporting cast...
","...surrounded by another 110 minutes of bad lead performances, horrible writing, bad editing, weak melodrama, incredibly obvious dialog that spells out what you already know, and very, very, very frequent boredom.
I've never seen a movie that depended on its supporting cast as much as this one. The first hour or so focuses almost entirely on stars Jude Law and Nicole Kidman--and it is one of the most deadly dull hours you've ever sat through in your life. It should be a punishable offence to make two such great talents look so amateur. It isn't until Rene Zellweger's Calamity Jane-ish Ruby appears on the screen--about an HOUR into the story--that the film shows any life at all. Luckily, Rene's performance is just the first of a series of great acting mini-masterpieces. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Eileen Atkins, Jena Malone, and, most surprisingly, Natalie Portman, all do amazing bits of work. Unfortunately, they are the lonely dots of pepper in this vast pot of bland Hollywood mush. Without their work, 'Cold Mountain' would just be another piece of homogenized, balless, corporate, tinseltown claptrap. 
How to fix it:1)	Get rid of the sappy music all together. I love movie music, but the score here never adds anything, it only subtracts.2)	Cut the dialog by 70%. What we've seen we don't need a narrator to tell us, and a good story doesn't need its characters to constantly tell us why they exist or what the movie's themes are.3)	Cut the entire film down to less than one hour and fifty minutes--because that's all the story there is.",Null,0,0,9 January 2004
Dreamgirls," Nowhere NEAR Oscar-worthy
","I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was REALLY underimpressed. Despite all the Oscar buzz, this is nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics. Except for Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie with no style or flair. Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each other!Now, the first half hour was good, but I was irritated at how Eddie Murphy's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages. Those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film. And the 'rise to the top' portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually dull and included too many sound-alike tunes.Condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as I'd expected they would. Each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people 'singing' AT each other. And the way they shot Hudson's big 'love me' number was criminal! Condon just shot her stomping around the stage--no drama at all! God it sucked!AND note to all involved--that 'sing-talking dialog' stuff might work on stage, but it DOES NOT WORK IN MOVIES (see embarrassing failures of Evita and Phantom). All that 'I'll teeeell youuuu something Efff-ieeee!' crap should have been left on the editing room floor. Those aren't 'songs.'Again, the film--except for Eddie Murphy's amazing performance--was nothing more than a glorified TV movie. There must have been megabucks behind the PR work for this film! I wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre-release 'one to beat' Oscar buzz? As a whole this film was, except for Eddie, NOWHERE NEAR an Oscar caliber movie! (except for Eddie) I'd rank it right up there with Grease 2. BIG disappointment, especially after all the (very expen$I've) hype!",4,18,28,20 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," 'Look' is Cool, But Story Hopelessly Truncated
","It may seem strange to say this about a film that already runs over two hours and twenty minutes, but 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' needs to be longer by fifteen minutes at the very least. The story is a complex one, by Potter standards, and way too many vital plot points race by up on the screen before they can really sink in. A person who had not read the book will likely not be able to tell what the hell is going on (but then that raises the question, do people who haven't read the books actually go to these movies?). 
Also, it is painfully ironic that while previous Potter helmer Chris Columbus' visual style was flat, obvious, and unspectacular in comparison to the moody, highly textured visions created by new guy Cuaron, his old fashioned simplicity did get the message across. You never had to ask why something happened or what a character's motivations was, there was always some blatant bit of expository dialog to spell it out for you. It may be unfashionable to say, but that's not a bad thing for this kind of flick in my book.  'Azkaban' could have done with a few more explanations from knowitall Hermione, for example: 'Don't you see, Harry, he has to fight the werewolf because'  Many, many plot points that are absolutely necessary for the audience to understand are either explained with a single line of dialog, or often not explained at all.But it is probably true that there at one time existed a longer, more coherent cut of the film, one which was then cut down to size to allow for kiddie attention spans and more showings per day for the multiplex owners.
It makes you wonder how the producers of the Potter films are going to adapt the later, and much, much longer novels in the series. Will 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' be released in two parts, a la Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' (or Richard Lester's 'Three Musketeers')?  Well, if Hollywood says that 3-hour family movies are a no-no, then 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Volume One' might be the only way to go.",Null,0,2,13 June 2004
Tropic Thunder," 15 Years Too Late and a Lot of Laughs Too Little
","I just saw Tropic Thunder. It wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to expectations. I can honestly say that I enjoyed Stiller's last directorial effort, Zoolander, much more than I did this flick. For me TT has two major flaws. Firstly, they couldn't decide whether they were filming a spoof or a satire--spoofs have jokes, satires have bitingly comic themes. Some of Stiller's jokes are goofy, laugh out loud surreal Zoolander-type stuff spoofing war movie clichés, but a lot of the movie is more like a social satire of the modern movie business, with characters behaving in non-joke ways to joke situations. And the two styles don't mix well in this movie. I think Still had way too much time to think about the screenplay over the years and was very, very interested in the story and characters, but couldn't resist sticking the cheap jokes in there as well--which take us as the audience out of the story and characters. Two styles in conflict. Secondly, the genre Stiller is using to spoof and as his springboard of satire, the Viet Nam War flick, is one that would have last been relevant to do a take on about 15 years ago. I mean, really--visual quotes from Platoon and Rambo? Those flicks aren't old enough for true iconic nostalgia and not current enough for most folks to really 'get' the spoofing.Anyway, it's an OK picture. Not much more. Maybe a really skilled director could have done more with it, but Stiller is still more of a performer than a director.",6,5,10,15 August 2008

After turning the bunch of white losers into winners with rhythm, the black coach finds out that he has changed for the better as well, no longer talking out loud to the screen during movies or calling women 'ho's', yadda, yadda, yadda.But I think I'll have to write that one myself.

The Love Guru," Even Meyers doesn't get the Joke
","Apparently even Mike Meyers didn't understand the fluky success of the Austin Powers movies. This is because he has now tried to impose the kind of crude, hoary and often outright juvenile and bad jokes that worked in those films onto a new character. What Meyer's doesn't seem to understand is that what made the Powers movies as enjoyable as they were was that the fact the jokes the Austin Powers character spouted were dumb and in bad taste was much more funny that the actual jokes themselves. In other words, we were all laughing at how incredibly and sublimely stupid most of the jokes were, not at the jokes themselves. Powers was a clueless character who was stupid and emotional arrested enough to think that what he was saying and doing was clever and funnyhe was funny because he was so pathetic yet so joyful about it. Powers was the perfect character for the type of humor Myers used in those films. But the formula just doesn't translate to The Love Guru. Without the proper context, the dick and feces jokes seem imposed on the story instead of being part of the whole concept. Meyers seems to have forgotten that we were very definitely laughing AT Austin Powers, yet he seems to want us to laugh WITH the guru Pitka.",3,4,11,3 July 2008
Batman Begins," Dull, except for the horrifically bad dialog
","I hate to say it, especially in light of the raves, but Batman Begins is a bore. This thing needed a few more rewrites (or at least one by a good writer) before it was set to film. The basic story is very well thought out, the origin of all Batman and all his iconic and psychological paraphernalia, but the dialog is horrible and the visuals lack style. Now I know that director Nolan was trying to set Batman in the 'real' world, but does the real world have to look so dull? More importantly, do the people have to all talk like zombified, robotic idiots? Even the fatass morons down I see buying candy bars with food stamps at the Safeway utter more colorful dialog than is offered in this movie. There is a complete lack of any wit, spontaneity, or intelligence in the dialog. The conversational dialog is stiff and--oddly enough for a film striving for realism-- archly cartoonish. And there are more lame, unfunny scene-ending bon mots in this thing than a 1980s Roger Moore James Bond movie. Oh, it's just freakin painful! If they couldn't hire someone who could write decent dialog they should have at least hired a director who knew when to CUT out bad dialog; this would have been much better as a silent film. And on top of that, the thick rubber bat costume STILL looks stupid. It is really jarring to have all this drab, 'realistic' set design with a guy in a fake-looking, goofy rubber suit running around in it. This thing makes thin Christian look like a black chipmunk with its ears clipped. I'm surprising even myself with this, given the high expectations I went into the film with, but I much prefer Tim Burton's Batman to this boring, predictable junk.",4,5,10,16 June 2005
1941," A Terrific Failure
","Except for a small following of fanatics, Spielberg's '1941' is almost universally regarded as an utter failure. Well, I have to admit that, while I am no fanatic, I do count '1941' as one of my guilty pleasures. I'll come right out and say it, though--the film is indeed a failure. But it is a spectacular one. And I must say that the full length version shown on TV, and currently available on DVD, is much better than the original theatrical version. At least the story makes more sense, in any case. And I believe that the folks who like it enjoy it for the film it could have been. Because, you see, the screenplay was a masterpiece.There is really only one reason why this film was a failure: Stephen Spielberg was the wrong man to direct it. Anyone can point out that his visual style at the time was wrong for the film--too hazy and 'flossy', like 'Close Encounters.' What it needed was an easy to read cartoonish look--kind of like the look Stanley Kramer gave this film's closest ancestor, 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.'Also, for a film renowned for it noise and action, it is in reality very slowly paced.  There are many spots to be bored.This was due in most part to Spielberg's misunderstanding of how to handle comedy as an art form. It is obvious that he abdicated his directorial command when it came to the actors, concentrating his skills on the visuals and effects (and even much of that effort was inappropriate to the task at hand). He had no idea why any of the material was supposed to be funny, so he just let the actors run wild in hopes that they knew. So, each of them tried desperately to be funny, all in totally different--and sometimes conflicting--styles. And, in almost every case-they failed.
A much better choice would have been to have all the actors play their parts 'straight.' As George Roy Hill supposedly told a confused Paul Newman during the filming of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid': 'You don't need to be funny. The story is funny. You just act.' What joy there is in '1941' come from the huge spectacle and tiny intricacies of the screenplay. Ned Beatty, Tim Mattheson, Nancy Allen, that other blonde chick, etc--none of them are naturally funny people--and it is painful to watch them try to be so. The overacting and mugging drags out scenes which should have been played super fast and snappy, like the real screwball comedies of the 1940s. The dialog scenes should have been kept at a minimum, because, by design of the screenplay, the actors are only interesting as props in the Rube Goldbegian plot they inhabit.It is ironic that '1941' is the rare film that actually would have been improved if the dialog and 'characterizations' had been cut to a minimum so we could get to the explosions and noise more quickly. I mean, do we really care to see and hear the lame interactions between Tim Mattheson and Nancy Allen as they each try to 'be funny'? Hell no! Just let us know enough to make it somewhat believable when they end up screwing in a pilotless plane over Hollywood as a crazed John Belushi attempts to shoot them out of the sky! The situation is what is funny--the people are just bogging it down.The only natural comic in the bunch--and the only actor who should have been given free reign to be wild--was John Belushi. The rest of the cast should have followed the leads of Toshiro Mifune and Robert Stack and the wildness of what was going on around them would have been much funnier.Too bad the studio didn't trust Zemeckis, now a famous director, to begin his filmmaking career with this movie.",Null,3,6,24 February 2002
X-Men: The Last Stand," Great Second Sequel That Wastes No Time
","Personally, I think the producers, writers, and Ratner hit this one out of the park. In my opinion there is little if any validity to the popular notion among fanboys that the film lacks characterization. To me, a third act--and that's what this really is as there is a conclusion to the general story arc of the trilogy-- is not so much about further developing characters, but in driving the characters and situations already presented towards the conclusion. We already know the main characters, their backgrounds, relationships, motivations, etc. By this point the actors are inside the skins of them to such a degree that a raised eyebrow or particular movement or tone of voice carries more weight and meaning. And I think the actors carry it off with aplomb. Are the minor mutants less developed? Yes--that's why they're minor characters--a sketch is all we need of them to develop the story, which focuses on the established main characters.Now, would X-3 stand up well on it's own? No, it would not. Because--ta daaaa--there would be a lack of proper character development! But that's because this is the third act in a classic three act story arc. That's how the filmmakers decided to do it. You just don't introduce whole new, fully rounded characters in the third act. They could have made it a whole new story, introduced the new characters with fully developed lives as though the series was going to go on for another ten movies. BUT they decided to bring closure to the story lines of Wolverine, Jean, Storm, Xavier, Rogue, Cyclops, and Magneto--the most important characters to the story arc. I personally think it was a wise decision, because I like stories with a beginning, middle, and an end. We can pick up with the lives of the others in later films.But as the third act and conclusion of the story arc, it was fantastic (Fat nerds all around me were shedding tears at the end). I thought the clarity of the plot provided by the screenwriters and Ratner's clear visualization of that story was refreshing and wonderfully free of bloat (unlike that piece of crap King Kong).And, I'd like to add that those who complain that the movie makers did not make proper use of the comic book story lines should just keep it in their nerdly pants. The films are the films, the comics are the comics. One need not replicate the other. To paraphrase what Cyclops said in the first filmyou want them to run around in yellow and blue tights as well?",10,2,3,20 June 2006
Hero," Hilarious Chinese Spaghetti 'Western' Cartoon
","'Hero' is a hoot! And let's set something straight--this movie has MUCH more in common with Sergio Leone's Italian westerns of this sixties, like 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,' or the Warner Brother's cartoons of the fifties than it does 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.''Hero' has the stony-faced super-powered protagonist of the Man with No Name. That's obvious--in fact almost everyone in the movie is as cool about violence as Lee Van Cleef on his coldest day. But 'Hero' has more than the attitude. It also has the vivid colors and, most importantly, the gloriously--and often hilariously--over the top visuals. Just as the best of the Spaghetti westerns risked being goofy in the pursuit bringing violence to the audience in a new way, so does 'Hero.'  For instance, a character in this movie is killed by 10,000 arrows. All that's left is a wall stuck with a solid coat of arrows--and a silloette of virgin wall where the man was standing! AND IT'S PLAYED TOTALLY STRAIGHT! Dramatic music and all. Funniest damn thing I've seen in years! It's like a Bugs Bunny cartoon!And the scene where Jet Li is doing the flying wire-fu thing over a lake is another riot. He is flying over the lake, barely touching the water now and then. Then, just as he's about to reach his foe, he changes his mind, puts on the air-brakes and does a goofy flip-flop, splashing water all over the place! And again, the musical score emphasises how dramatic this is supposed to be. But it's FUNNY! And I'm not being sarcastic--it was funny!  I can't believe it wasn't mean to be humorous. I just can't. If this movie had a comic musical score instead of a serious one, everyone would see it for the parody of the genre it MUST have been intended to be.",Null,0,0,1 June 2003
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Great Fun and a Great Relief
","I thought 'FF:Rise of the Silver Surfer' was great fun. I'm glad that Tim Story and crew managed to completely ignore the bad press the last film got and just forged ahead with their vision for # 2 (of course, they were helped by a $158 million take at the US Box Office for the last movie).I've nothing against the Batman-Style angst-ridden superhero genre, but after they angst-ed up Superman, the most positive of heroes, I knew that the 'dark superhero' thing had just become a cliché in its own right. Every freakin' superhero has to be miserable for some reason. Bloat is the other Superhero movie ailment. Even the feisty Spiderman franchise has finally caught the 'Too Many Villains, Too Many Plots-itis' disease from Batman. So, depression and confusion rule most of today's superhero movies--except for FF. The Fantastic Four have so far avoided both these traps. For the most part, the film shows having superpowers as being fun. In keeping with the original comic, the super-characters in the FF films do have problems like other folks-- but not deep, dark, brooding problems. And 'Surfer's' plot, while typically comic book fantastic, is comparably straightforward and linear. AND, I might add, free of flab. No three hour epic here. Just a tightly composed entertainment that runs about 90 minutes--like an action movie should.To sum up--I liked it a lot! And I predict another hit and another installment in the works!",8,5,10,18 June 2007
Garden State," For the Under 25 Crowd Only (or those with stunted emotional maturity)
","I'm 43 years old. 'Garden State' was excruciating for me to watch. I found the thing narcissistic, overbearingly precious, stilted, pretentious, unrealistic, and worst of all--dull. But I will concede that I would probably have viewed this 'Graduate' rip off a bit more favorably back when I was in my twenties. That was back when I was a dumbass who thought the world revolved around me (and also back when 'screaming into the abyss' would have seemed 'cool' instead of just a sophomorically obvious attempt at metaphor). Writer/Director Zach Braff might--just 'might'--have been able to pull off something less cloying, obvious, immature, and vomitously faux intellectual if he had turned the directorial reigns over to someone else. The script has some good moments, but they are far outweighed by the monstrous love Braff's camera has for his own blank face and the equally blind love he has for his own often-stilted and pretentious dialogue. An experience filmmaker would have known how to trim away the self-love and nonsense and made a real movie out of this mess.",3,18,40,20 February 2005
Shrek 2," Needs More Kitty! Otherwise great!
","Possible Spoiler if you haven't paid any attention to the ad campaign at all::'Shrek 2' is great fun. My only criticism is the woeful underuse of the new Puss in Boots character. Considering the hilarious buildup and intro the character is provided, he has little to do and little to do with the plot. I suspect Puss was the victim of the filmmaker's need to shorted the movie for kiddie attention spans as it is pretty obvious that his turnaround from foe to friend is severely truncated. One moment he's the unstoppable assassin out to off Shrek and Donkey, the next he's Shrek's bosom pal with no more than an 'I have mish-jujjed joo.' I just know that there's a lot of Puss left on the cutting room floor (stop sniggering). Hopefully we'll get an extended cut with more PIB for the DVD release and not just a bunch of random, out of context deleted scenes tacked on as extras.",Null,0,0,7 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Needed to be at least 15 minutes longer
","This installment of Harry Potter is the first one in which the filmmakers trimmed away virtually every subplot that was present in the huge book upon which it is based; only the main plot is served. A good idea I think. But, even though they cut the plot(s) to the bone, the second half of the film still feels rushed. It is about at the halfway point that the clear, focused editing of the movie turns choppy, with one sequence following another with little or no transition; I kept expecting the characters to get cut off in mid-sentence, but that never actually happened. Also, this HP, though generally very high in quality, suffers from the same lack of clarity that has afflicted each of the films in the series since the unjustly maligned first two installments. The director of the first two, Chris Columbus, was bashed by some for creating a simplistic, Disney-ish version of the Potter stories. There may be a little truth to that, but there's also something that no one credits him for--clarity. There is not a single moment in either of the first two films where anyone in the audience could have been heard asking another one 'What just happened?' The films since the first two have upped the sophistication level and pace considerably, but have in the process lost this clarity. For example in this most recent film I could hear people all around me asking each other questions about what they'd just seen, especially during the rushed second half. The editors don't seem to realize what story points need to be emphasized and made clear. For instance, kissing scene or no, the budding and then decaying relationship between Harry and Cho is played in such muted tones that many in the audience not familiar with the book were left wondering what was going on when things started to go bad. And Luna Lovejoy's last lines were so subtlety presented that my wife whispered to me 'That went right past mewhat is she talking about?' The editors and screenwriters of the Potter films, tasked with condensing the increasingly gigantic novels into 2 hour films are falling into the trap of mistaking the mere dispensing of information with the telling of a story. Storytelling is about rhythm and flow, high points and quiet timesit's not about just lining all the bits and pieces up in neat, even rows.",7,0,2,13 July 2007
The Artist," I Don't Understand the Universal Praise
","I really don't get it. My wife and I went to see The Artist this past Saturday and I was left with an overwhelming feeling of 'meh.' Which is really surprising, given the almost universal, glowing praise this film has been getting--what with Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations, etc (not to mention all the 10-star reviews here on IMDb).I just didn't see anything special here. I mean, they filmmakers did a fairly good job of recreating a silent film, but they didn't take it any further than that. The plot, acting, etc, was no better or worse than a real silent film. I've seen many much, much better silent films on TCM's Silent Sundays each weekend. Those who are gushing over this movie have apparently not seen very many real silent films from the 20s. If they had, I think they'd have found this film kind of a 'been there, seen that' kind of experience as I did. Or maybe this Artist-Praise-Hysteria is mostly the result of folks desperately wanting to jump onto the bandwagon of the newest 'cool' thing.The thing that bothered me most (besides the stretches of tedium) was that the cinematography was distractingly flat and gray--there were no real blacks and no real whites. I understand from articles I've read that this low-contrast, glowy B&W was intentional. But I didn't like it. Just looked like it was poorly shot with a bad video camera with the contrast turned all the way down. (this wasn't helped by the fact that the theatre I saw it in now presents all their 'films' via digital projection--a process that, in my opinion, has NOT been perfected yet and is still too 'low res' for cinema).All in all, 'The Artist' should be nothing more than a minor, vaguely interesting experiment that would have had a better home on video. How it has become an indie sensation with Oscar nominations is a totally mysterious to me. Wonder how much money it took to convince us all that is was a masterpiece?",5,65,106,30 January 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's last flip-off, or just his cure for insomnia?
","I must begin my analysis of the great Stanley Kubrick's last film by describing my personal experience with 'Eyes Wide Shut.' That experience can best be described like this; 'Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......'Admittedly, 'EWS' does have that fascinating Kubrick look on occasion. But the visuals are absolutely the only interesting part about it. If this movie had not been shot by Kubrick, recalling set and lighting design from many of his previous films, it would be no better than any other immature flick foisted on us by yet another  self-important first time art film director whose movie dies a quick late-night death on the Independent Film Channel. Except longer. This is a two hour and forty minute movie in which about fifty minutes worth of stuff happens. The film has been called 'deliberately paced' and that it is. And there's nothing wrong with that, if the film in question eventually takes you someplace. take Jim Jarmusch's movies, for instance--they're slow, but there are surprises along the way you couldn't see coming. With 'EWS' Kubrick and his co-scriptor give us long, drawn-out dialogue sequences that end up concluding just as we knew they would when they started--with no surprises in-between!The plot, such as it is, and without revealing any of the surprises, such as they are, is simply this: A rich New York doctor and his wife (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) have a fight after a party in which she accuses him of flirting. When he laughs off her pot-inspired accusations, she tells him a story of a time when she really wanted to be unfaithful--not a time when she actually was, mind you, just a time she thought about it (and if Kidman weren't dressed in flimsy lingerie during the scene, it would have no interest at all--as it is, it's a dirty old man's mild wet dream). Cruise deals with his wife's shattering non-revelation by wandering the city at night, tentatively attempting to hunt up some stray bootie.
As plot, only two sequences hold any surprises or interest. One involves Leelee Sobeskie in her underwear--I won't spoil it. The other is he famous setpiece which takes place at a super-secret party where everyone wears druid robes and 'Amadeus' masks while they watch people screw (this is the scene which was infamously toned down with digitally superimposed figures covering up the simulated sex acts). Neither sequence can save the film from its dull, ponderous pretend pretensions, however. In fact, the notorious sex society sequence is little more than laughable.Wow--a sex club in the Big Apple? My god!!! What imagination! Let's get real: the only thing unusual about this place, pomp and circumstance aside, is that it's secret! In reality, this 'club' would be running ads in the tabloids like the rest of the live sex dives! Perhaps if the movie had been set back in the 50's or before, the deadly seriousness of the secret sex society would have made sense.
If all of the dead spots in 'EWS' were removed, the entire movie could have been boiled down to a typical late-night skin flick on Cinemax (it makes as much sense). Considering the occasional beauty of its cinematography and the dead zone created by its narrative, 'Eyes Wide Shut' would have been much more successful as a dirty coffee table book.",Null,0,0,31 July 2001

The Da Vinci Code," Already Ripe for the MST3K Treatment
","The DaVinci Code is even worse than most big budget Hollywood slop. Not only is the dialog of Ed Wood quality, the story nothing but a series of clichés, the casting way off on all counts, and the plot twists visible from the end of the block--it's also boring! I mean, lots of crappy movies are also entertaining, but this one, though technically slick, fails to be entertaining on any level. Now, I never read the novel, so I have no opinion on whether the movie was faithful to the book. But I can tell you that if it was faithful, the book must be a total piece of junk. I suspect, however, that the novel must have been fun in some way, must have taken itself less seriously, and must have been more quickly paced and adventurous than this dead-on-arrival chunk of cookie cutter Hollywood blah de blah.I honestly believe this snoozer, with it's cliché-drenched plot and dumb dialog, would have played better as an intentional comedy.",2,0,2,27 May 2006
Titanic," 'A Night to Remember 3'
","I liked 'Titanic'. Its a good old fashioned adventure/romance/epic with a strong storyline and definable characters. Sure the tacked on romance is as stock as the characters, but that is still better than the alternative served up by most modern movies: ie--no plot and no characterization at all. The thing that bothers me about this version of the Titanic sinking is that writer/director Cameron takes full credit for the screenplay, when so much of it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event, 'A Night to Remember' (also a book, and a previous film). And I'm not talking about the fact the Titanic sunk, or any of the other factual details of the story--obviously those will be the same. I'm talking about virtually identical scenes, events, and dialogue that could not be gathered from public record. Scenes such as the ship's builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom, looking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down. Or the rich ship corporation a**hole being told that yes, his ship is going to sink, no matter what he says. Or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking through the gates. These scenes, and many others, are mounted and shot in so similar a fashion to the previous film, with such similar dialog, that I believe they cross the border into plagerism. Rent the 1958 version of 'A Night to Remember', watch it, and tell me I'm wrong.",Null,3,4,21 August 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Empire Strikes Back without the Twist
","'The Matrix Reloaded' suffers heavily from 'The Empire Strikes Back' Syndrome: It's bloated with more special effects and less story than the original film it follows, repeats both the film it is the sequel as well as repeating itself, and it takes itself way too seriously, buying too deeply into the mystical gobbletygook set up in the first film (oh, and each rips off a major scene from 'Dune').  'Empire' was a success, however, because it concluded with a slam-bang revelation that was perfect emotionally as well as plot-wise: 'Luke I am your father.' 'Matrix Reloaded's' big ending is...nothin' really. The movie is all set up and computer generated kung fu. In the original Matrix every action scene meant something to the story, each was a mystery (how's that chick floating in the air like that?), or a learning experience (leap off the building), or at least had a definite purpose in the story. 'Reloaded' simply has fights to have fights. The most-hyped fight, the one with hundreds of Agent Smiths, is amazing at first but soon degenerates into overblown, phoney-looking self parody.'Reloaded' sets up some interesting possiblities, but they would have been best utilized as the opening of a single sequel instead of a 2+ hour prelude.",Null,0,0,27 May 2003

And a lot of the dialog is just lame ('Its like livin' with a rattlesnake'). For me, the music and Jeff Bridges' Oscar-winning performance almost make up for it, except for one other element that drove me nuts--the sound editing is way over the top. Every damn sound effect is pushed to the top of the mix. I mean every snort, breath going in or out of someone's nose, splash of liquor in a bottle, cigarette being lit, groan, bedspring, lip smack, chewing sound, footstep, screen door clatter, door shutting--EVERYTHING that should be basically INCIDENTAL is so freakin' LOUD that it took me out of the story.An odd complaint, probably.

As it is, however, this version of 'Man on Fire' will be remembered more as the movie where Denzel Washington played a badass without winning an Oscar.Don't get me wrong--this is a pretty good Death Wish ripoff, despite all the excessive goop Tony Scott throws on top of it (all the nutty editing, change of movie stocks, and unnessesary subtitling was cool in his short 'Hire' clip, but is intrusive in a real movie).I mean, why weren't they throwing the big budget money at this kinda cliche revenge action script back when there were men more suitable for the role?

Fantastic Four," Almost Great, but 'third act' is totally missing!
","The makers of the 'Fantastic Four' got the characters and spirit of the original comic just right, and the story of how they got their powers and what they do with them once they get them is perfectly in line with the Stan Lee-Jack Kirby classic (The dark-skinned Jessica Alba does look a bit too young for the part, and a bit artificial as a blonde, but I don't think anyone will complain much because she handles the part well and still looks great).But despite these positives, the screenwriters completely dropped the ball on the 'third act'--what we regular people usually call the end of the flick, the slam bang climax,the part where the heroes save the world from the evil villain through thrilling daring do. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone out there, but let's just say that when the movie comes to its abrupt end, you will definitely feel as though about 20 minutes of action was left on the cutting room floor (or in the screenwriter's trash can). Ultimately,however, 'Fantastic Four' is not meant to be heavy like that pretentious, overpraised crapfest 'Batman Begins.' This is a light film, with lots of humor based on the realities of everyday life--more of a 'sitcom with action' than 'gothic opera with action,' just as the comic was in the early days. There's not a thing dark about it. And in a way it is refreshing to see a superhero film that focuses almost entirely on likable characters instead of a huge ear-splitting, eye-assaulting cgi end-of-the-world mindblast of an action ending.Even so, I think most folks who see the movie will leave the theater asking their friends and themselves 'was that it?'",10,5,14,10 July 2005

The Island," Second Try for Obvious Truth
","I found that my original comment on this film had been deleted because 'someone' reported it for 'abuse.' I've deleted on already expurgated fake-expletive and here it is again. If it gets deleted this time, I'll know something is up. Of course in the time since 'The Island' the EXACT SAME THING has happened again, with Pixar refusing to admit that 'Cars' is a remake of 'Doc Hollywood.' The more things change...I haven't seen The Island, so I'm not going to comment on whether it's any good or not. But my question is this: how can the Screenwriter's Guild have possibly allowed the writers of the screenstory and screenplay of The Clonus Horror (1979) to be omitted from the credits of 'The Island' (and also, I'm assuming, the $ that goes with that honor)? From the synopsis I've read it is the same story! And in many instances, the exact same story! Now, don't get me wrong--I think a big budget remake of something like Clonus is a good thing. The original had a good idea that the filmmaker's just didn't have the money or time to make into a good film. In fact, I wouldn't mind if Hollywood made more big budget remakes of low-budget flicks ('Race With the Devil' 2006 anyone?).No, what bothers me is this wholesale rip-off! The arrogance to not even acknowledge the FACT that your film is a remake in every sense of the word. Would 'based on an original screenplay by...' credit have killed them? Would the money they'd have to have paid for the rights have taken that big a chunk out of the $120 million budget? I hope Clonus director Robert Fiveson and his screenwriters take this up with the Guild, or sue in court, and get some money and their names added to the credits for the DVD release.",5,3,6,25 August 2006
