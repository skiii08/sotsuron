The Hangover," Seriously, people think this is funny?
","Maybe it was over-hyped, maybe it just sucked, but this movie is overrated. I am not a movie snob, but this movie was not very funny. There was not one scene that made me belly laugh. Bradley Cooper always seems to play the a-hole and his eyes are annoyingly crooked. Zach G is so much better on Bored to Death. Hated the way they used the baby. Anyway, good concept with weak writing. If you want a mindless comedy Old School is much better, but as far as this year, Funny People had more depth and way more laughs. Don't believe the hype! See it just to tell people how dumb it was. IMDb says I have to write more, but I can't even think of any more to say about this piece of crap.",2,6,13,16 January 2010
