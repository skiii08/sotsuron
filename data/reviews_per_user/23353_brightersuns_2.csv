The Blair Witch Project," Disturbingly brilliant; or brilliantly disturbing?
","Having been a bog fan of 'horror' movies, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of movies that actually scared me. If this is not the most frightening movie I have ever seen, then it's in the top three for sure. The film is scary not in the sense of 'shock', ie. Jason jumps out from behind a tree and yells 'BOO!', but scary in that disturbing way, that for the duration of the film, you have this sense of profound dread building up, the kind of terror that children who play in the woods at night and hear a scary sound feel for a brief while. Sitting in the movie theater, the most honest feeling I had was 'I just want this to END'. Not because it was a bad film; I loved it. But because the terror of the charicters was almost tangible and spilling over into the audience. A must see.",9,1,1,2 August 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Unfortunately Terrible
","I was unaware what to expect from this faux-musical, so I expected the worst. Tragically, I was proven right. While this film will not make my 10 Worst Films list, it's pretty close, and only Luhrmann's visually exciting direction kept me from leaving. If you're researching a paper on Luhrmann, this might be worth seeing; otherwise it serves as a stark reminder of why musicals went out of fashion so many years ago.",4,0,3,2 February 2002
