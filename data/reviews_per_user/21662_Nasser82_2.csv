The Incredible Hulk," 1st Impression , Is the last Impression !
","Alright i'll make it short & sweet . This is one of the most entertaining movies i have ever seen. From the moment i entered the cinema & the movie start , i couldn't finish my pop corn & the drink .. The action views are perfect which can make you jump from ur seat .. ED Norton & the other casts performances was amazing.Basically when i saw the trailer of this movie before it release, i was impressed , However i was afraid that the movie might not be as good as the trailer is ( Like usual movies nowadays unfortunately ) But i was WRONG big time .My 1st impression was the last impression. The Hulk character was perfectly made as well as Ahe Abomonation. The CGI was great. Forget about the people who r talking too much for nothing ! Just enter the movie & enjoy THE WAR ! Thank you MR.DIRECTOR for making our summer a wonderful one with our Green Friend..Good Day ..",10,8,14,27 June 2008
Man of Steel," For me, the 2nd best super hero movie after TDK.
","In short, Brilliant movie, Great visual effects, Deep Drama, Great Action & Great Cast. What more do we need right? .. there was a very slight issue with editing here but its barely noticeable. Henry C. did a great job as a superman. His body language fits the character. Moreover, Hans Zimmer made this movie better and better with the OST. Critics mentioned 'there is too much action' ?!! U gotta be kidding me right. Its a SUPERMAN movie, a GREAT SUPER HERO. Do expect more tears,drama etc.. than action??? Give us a brake critics and get a life OK. The movie is highly recommended for fans. DON'T MISS IT. It deserves an Oscar or 2 if not more.",10,2,6,27 June 2013
