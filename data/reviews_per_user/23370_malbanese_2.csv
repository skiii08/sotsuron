Sucker Punch," Seriously Zack, can i have a refund?
","Any remnant of a story must have been left on the cutting room floor. I waited in anticipation for a year for this and was excited to see the first few trailers. But then i read a review or 2 bagging the end product. 'No' I said to myself, i'll make my own mind up. And that i did. Wish i didn't see it. What a waste of celluloid. Zack S must be one of the best young directors around, but you couldn't tell from this trashy offering. I thought, at least it should be better than Battle:LA. Right? Well actually it's probably on par. Both have poor scripts, both have poor acting, both have taken my money. When being robbed, i like to be hit across the back of the head and told 'this is a stick up'. Nowadays, they just show you a great trailer and slog you at the box office. Heartless Bastards. Now i know why it's called Sucker Punch. I'm the sucker, and i've just been punched. Shame on you Zack. It'll take a lot of making up (not just pointless effects) to get you back on top in my books.",1,8,16,7 April 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," You better not have hoped for much!
","First let me start by saying that I knew when I went to see Transformers 3, that i was going to be in for a big budget blockbuster, so I wasn't hoping for too much in the way of depth or volume or character development. But hell, a little wouldn't have been too much to ask. I know I know, it's Michael Bay at his ocular raping best, but something is missing here. Something big. I think Sucker Punch proved, you can't just through a tonne of money and special effects at a turd and hope it will polish itself. And this is no exception. Don't get me wrong, it's a major improvement on Revenge of the Fallen, but not quite up to the standard of the first. What has happened here (in MY opinion folks. Don't get upset. You're all entitled to one, and have one (opinions, not assholes)) is, we seem to have lost the need or want to tell a story. The special effects here have spared no expense. The 3D is OK only surpassed by Avatar or Jackass 3D (no, seriously, if you'd seen Jackass 3D, you would know what I'm talking about). I guess you have to tune right out and not try to think about the film so much to rate it 10 out of 10, but when I'm paying hard earned dollars to see something special, I expect something special. This is not special. To be honest, my favorite thing about the whole film was the Green Lantern 3D trailer at the beginning. I guess I had hyped this film up for myself too much and it failed to live up to my own expectations (also my friends who sat next to me complaining about the stupidity of the weak ass story). But I imagine I'm not alone. I think a lot of people have high expectations of big budget blockbusters and want to see something mind numbingly great. But this just didn't do it for me. Why? Because it was just plain stupid. The story had holes you could drive Optimus Prime through (at one point he does). And come on, since when do Robots have free-kin HAIR???? Robots with lips is one thing, but hair? I draw the line people.So see it (at your peril). But please don't expect to be blown away. Maybe expectations of an epileptic seizure (there is a lot going on at one time, flashing lights, explosions, space shuttle disasters and robots with hair) are more appropriate.I can only hope Green Lantern lives up to the trailers expectations.",4,8,19,29 June 2011
