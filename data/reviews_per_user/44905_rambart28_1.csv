Sucker Punch," Very enjoyable movie... for a select group
","I absolutely loved the movie but I will be honest, I am a video game playing teenage boy. This movie was designed specifically for me and my general demographic. I would strongly suggest this movie to all teenagers and/or fans of video games or violent anime. If you are looking for a strong character driven story that is deep and thought provoking, this is not your movie.While watching, I tried my best to watch subjectively and avoid being blinded my scantily clad women being very violent (one of the sexiest I can imagine). Keeping that in mind, I can say that the movie is very much driven by the visuals, not the story. Although the plot was not to strong, and at times confusing, it did its job, gave the visuals meaning and context without the feeling of 'why the hell is this necessary?' The plot had enough content to keep me fully involved with what was going on and had bright shining moments but honestly, it is not the reason you would buy tickets.This movie was so squarely aimed at my demographic that it is hard to remove bias, so I won't and i will give it a 10/10 and buy my tickets to see it again. If you are a teenager who enjoys stunning visuals, very well filmed and edited fights, hot female leads, and a video game style plot that resembles a real life anime this is your perfect movie as well. If not, you may be disappointed but i would not discourage anyone from seeing it.",10,5,13,28 March 2011
