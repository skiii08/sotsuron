Black Swan," The quest for perfection is over..
","I started watching this movie out of boredom, for a few minutes before sleep and I found myself shivering at 4 o'clock in the morning wondering what the heck happened...I knew Darren Aronofsky was good after watching 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'The Fountain' but I didn't expect this...Anyway if someone stole the whole show that was Natalie Portman...she delivers the performance of a lifetime...Honey...welcome to the big league...Forget 'Star Wars', 'V for Vendetta' and keep a bit of 'Leon' and 'Garden State'...You are not the best young actress at the moment but you are definitely in the top one !If Natalie doesn't deserve an Oscar for her portraying of Nina Sayers then nobody ever did...Enjoy !",10,3,8,22 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Disappointment of the year...for me
","After expecting the 4th instalment of the POTC for more then 3 years...oh, dear...I feel like I just wasted more then 2 hours of my life...I love the Pirates, especially Jack so I caught the first show on the release day only to feel so frustrated after the first 15 minutes of the movie...Kept saying it has to get better but it didn't...same stale, lifeless,annoying on occasion dialogue, lack of chemistry between the characters (made me miss Orlando Bloom...a lot...and I hate Orlando Bloom..), even lack of action...I enjoyed the sparkly, witty dialogues in the previous parts...Witty Jack doesn't have a witty line in this in over two hours...the best he can do is:' There should be a captain in there somewhere...' Phuah...!!! Barbossa is unrecognisable, Gibbs is plain boring, as is the villain Blackbeard...Penelope is a better actress then Keira in my opinion but in a serious movie, in this pirates flick Keira is as well missed...Not to mention the Pearl crew...!!! If you are going in as I was, hoping to hear Jack saying: Alas, my children...you will always remember today as the day you almost caught...(wave in the face)....Sparrow...!!! prepare for' Alas my children today is the day you will always remember as the death of the Pirates of the Caribbean series' Such a shame...PS Judy Dench & Keith Richards=the only class in the act...",3,7,15,18 May 2011
Skyfall," Oh Sam, oh Sam...what have ye done...?
","Vesper Lynd: It doesn't bother you? Killing all those people? James Bond: Well I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did. Well James, those days are long gone... The sharp, sophisticated and tough as nails 007 that I expected to see in Skyfall died sometimes between Casino Royale and Q_o_S...The only time when I was reminded of the good old Bond in Sam's adaptation was when after a last moment escape from a hairy situation his main concern was to adjust his cuff links...For me this is what James Bond it's all about...This agent is anything but provocateur...depressed, lonely, with a bit of a drinking problem, not afraid to get in touch with his feelings and shed a tear towards the end of the movie...The villain is weak, childish and whatever his reasons for seeking revenge I really can't bring myself to care about him in anyway... the Bond girls make cameo appearances before one of them is shot just for the fun of it, the story has more holes then a piece of Swiss cheese...Disappointing...!I really think that Sam Mendes has no idea of what makes James Bond...well, James Bond. 007 used to fly planes and drive tanks through Moscow, do you really see him riding the tube with you reading Metro on a Tuesday afternoon on his way back from MI6?",2,35,73,28 October 2012
