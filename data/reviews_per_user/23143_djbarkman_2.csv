It," Notice how most 10/10 reviews are from people who didn't read the book.
","I thought this was a good movie, but I spent most of the movie complaining to my brother how different the movie was to the book. And to get things straight, I don't usually care about changes a lot of movies make from book to movie. Everyone else was complaining about the changes in Pet Sematary, but I thought they were refreshing, and I understood why they made those changes. And in IT, I understood some of the changes, like the Turtle, the Spider, and Chud, because that would make the movie TOO weird. It was just the little things, like Mike's bird, the clubhouse, Hi-yo Silver, away, the smokehouse, the mummy, everything with the standpipe, the photo album(s), and stuff like that. What makes IT an amazing book is not the horror aspect (even though that part was amazing too) but it was the times in between the horror where the character development took place and you got to know and love all of the characters. In this, I felt like I knew about 3 things about each of the characters, and that's about IT. I do want to say that I am pointing out negatives in this, but there were so many positives as well. Pennywise himself is amazing in this film, not to mention all the acting. It was a solid film (and I loved the homage to the turtle -- try to spot it when you watch the movie) and the only reason I didn't like it was because it didn't make me feel the love for the characters that it did in the book. I don't necessarily think it was anyone's fault, IT is just a really hard book to turn into a movie.",8,0,0,19 May 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," This movie is a champion, my friends.
","This movie is amazing, and I recommend to about everyone. When I used to think of Queen, I just thought of it as the 'We Will Rock You' people. But after seeing the movie, they are so much more to me. This is up there with Shawshank for the best movies I have ever seen.",10,2,2,29 December 2018
