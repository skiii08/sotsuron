Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful from Inside Out
","I've been a huge fan of the original blade runner, I think it's one of those cult classics which not many people talk about, however after few years people started appreciating the beauty of that film. The original blade runner is a movie which is known as a movie ahead of its time, a movie which not many people found intriguing, even today many of the audience will not prefer such type of world building story arc with breathtaking visuals, but even then, it was a masterpiece
Now after 35 years we have a sequel to that movie, at first I thought it's probably one of the worst ideas to make a sequel of blade runner, cuz we all know how sequels of classic movies turn out to be, they make it so bad that they even ridicule the original, but I still had some optimism in me, because the director of the sequel is Denis Villeneuve, who has directed movies such as Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival movies which I have clearly enjoyed, and writers who did the writing of the original blade runner such as Philip K. Dick, Hampton Francher and David Webb Peoples.
So I thought maybe there is a chance that this movie will not disappoint or at best will be good but nowhere near close to the OG blade runner, and oh my god how terribly wrong I was.
Blade Runner 2049 is a cinematic feat at a high level, this movie is brilliant it's all those good heavy words you can come up with and still not appreciate enough the efforts director of this movie has put and his team. Blade Runner 2049 is not only an excellent sequel but it's a sequel which is even better than the original, if the IMDB had a higher rating than 10, then I would give that rating too.
Blade Runner 2049 is a perfectly paced sci-fi drama you can watch right now, in terms of its visuals, the plot, the characters this movie is a seamless experience of what a great film supposed to be. In this movie we get introduced to the characters such as K who is a replicant his job is to hunt down the older models replicant, after hunting down one of the older models he finds a box which was dugged deeper in the old replicant's property. His mission is to find out the true mystery of that box, and what more the mystery folds into.
This movie has focused about this character, he wants to know about his purpose, he know that he is a replicant, but why he is in this world, what is his purpose, what is the distinction between Humans and replicants. What I absolutely like about this movie is that Denis focused very well on the main character, you feel for him as the movie progresses, when he finds out something new about the case, you are witnessing that too. Character building is one of the strongest part of this movie, but in terms of its visual this movie is refreshment for the eyes, the set designs, the CGI, the cinematography of this movie is unlike anything I've ever seen, I've never seen the practical effects and the CGI effects go hand in hand with each other so perfectly and the end results are just Marvellous, I've never seen such a beautiful movie in my life since Avatar, the movie is dripping with colours. Denis Villeneuve didn't change much of the environment as the futuristic technology driven world looks similar to that of the original blade runner, but 2049 has more location and overall is much more grander in scale, the soundtrack of this movie is also a excellent, Hans Zimmer yet again has done a great job with sound composing, well I would expect nothing less from such a talented person like him.
Blade Runner 2049 isn't your average movie it's not like those summer block buster action pack film which will keep you at the edge of your seat for its thrill or this isn't a sci-fi movie which is based on good Vs evil generic concept. It's something different we've never witnessed before, even with a runtime of 2 hrs and 43 mins which is almost 3 hrs this movie feels long but not too long, that was the only problem I had with the OG blade runner is that the movie felt lot longer than its runtime and even at certain scenes the movie dragged a bit, but that isn't the case with 2049 it is perfectly paced from the beginning till the end. Denis Villeneuve has a created a masterpiece and years from now this movie will be remembered as classic to the sci-fi genre.",10,0,9,10 September 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Overrated
","Now by the title you must be thinking that I'm one of those people who just for the sake of being a idiot calling a really great film not so great cuz I want to standout, well NO! I really and Genuinely feel like into the spider verse is quite overrated, now do not confuse overrated with bad, at the end of the film I actually found myself really enjoying this one, I watched it with my lil brother who's a massive Spiderman fan we really had a great time, the characters were enjoyable, the humour was good, The animation was jaw dropping it was spectacular, the story was good, the villains could have been better but the director gave the main villain a backstory which I would say for the most part is convincing but not anything we haven't seen in tons of other comic book movie but he wasn't a hindrance so not a big issue for me... Cuz this film really focuse on the journey of miles Morales which I was never really interested in, but this movie did the character a justice and he served his purpose well so what went wrong?
THE FAN BASE I watched this movie pretty late, I waited for this movie to come on OT platform and it did and I watched it, basically every reviews I read about this movie everyone was praising how brilliant this movie is.. what an amazing time people had in the theatres.. hailing this movie as not only one of the best comic book films of the year but one of the best movies of the year.. some of the latest reviews that I've seen people count into the spider verse as one of the best films of the DECADE! and I was like OHK. fine I'll watch it then. Now I didn't watch this movie with sky high expectations.. whenever I watch a film I try to watch it with as minimum expectations as possible and into the spider verse was no exception in that way I can enjoy a good movie to its full potential and to watch really bad movie by not getting too frustrated
And after the film I was entertained but I was thinking what was in this film which made people really appreciate it's quality talking so many great things about it which made this film won an OSCAR for a featured animated film where some other movies like A Silent Voice, Your Name, Wolfchildren, The Wind Rises, When Marnie Was There and Grave Of The Fireflies. were not even considered for Nominations and into the spider verse was. Although I've already lost my faith in OSCAR but I thought people really had a better understanding of what should be great and what not should be
Look I'm not a hater of this movie and I'm not being a harsh critch either. I like this movie I would rather was 100s of into the spider verse than one Homecoming or Far From Home but I wouldn't exaggerate by counting it as one of the greatest.",7,1,2,1 January 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," The Third Great Charm.
","In most of the trilogies that I've watched over the years, the third movie is inferior to the first two, I've seen it in the godfather Trilogy, the matrix trilogy and many more. However, very few times we actually get a trilogy in which the third film is as good as the other two or even better.
Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight was a cinematic masterpiece, a movie which revolutionaries the entire comic book genre, after that many people started paying attention to the comics book movies, but the bar which was set by The Dark Knight was very high. People really wanted to know what happened after The Dark Knight.. what happens to Bruce Wayne? Will the Harvey dent's secret will always be a secret? Or will it ever be revealed, and what will happen to Gotham if there will be no batman.
Which makes The Dark Knight Rises one of the most anticipated movies of all time, but it also has a job to deliver people's expectations and does it deliver it? The answer is ABSOLUTELY YES!
The Dark Knight Rises is simply brilliant! It's a movie which gave me nostalgia, but most importantly it was a great Conclusion to one of the great trilogies we have now.
The Dark Knight Rises is a slow burn unlike The Dark Knight, it starts off introducing the characters to knowing how some characters are doing after the events of The Dark Knight. How some characters are living under a lie, how some characters couldn't move on from what happened and how some characters couldn't face the outside world. This movie doesn't have the cheap drama which will force you to cry or to feel sympathy for the characters, these characters feel genuine, you feel for their loss, you understand what they are going through, but when the heat slowly feels to get warmer with intensity and thrill it will keep at the edge of your seat.
Christian bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman has delivered an excellent performance, by far the best in the trilogy. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Mr. Fox, Gary Oldman as James Gordon all of the actors which you are familiar of has given us a remarkably good performance.. the new characters like Anne Hathaway as Catwoman and Joseph Gordon Levitt as Officer Blake was very appreciable. As they played the characters so well they completely blend into the movie.
Tom Hardy as Bane was outstanding, in the entire movie I was terrified by the villain and made me worry so much about Bruce Wayne because he is completely at his vulnerable point where he hasn't been batman for years to face such a villain who's superior to him in terms of strength but also very intellectual just makes you more pumped up for the film Bane is a villain which is driven by motivation and rage but is very much clear to his goal and will make it happen no matter what. As he has some evil plans to torture an entire city. And does most of those thing to Gotham.
I can go on and on about this movie but I worry that I accidentally will give out spoilers to you. But I can say this with confidence that The Dark Knight Rises is a great conclusion to The Dark Knight, if you want to watch a trilogy in which all the three films are great, then you might want to check this one out.",9,0,1,21 May 2019
