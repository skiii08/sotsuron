Skyfall," If not the best Bond film of all time, it's pretty damn close
","Skyfall is in my personal opinion, one of the greatest James Bond movies ever. I realize that what I have just said is a very huge statement to make, but Skyfall delivers so much on so many levels. Director Sam Mendes deserves a ton of credit. From the dialogue, to the cinematography, and amazing villain (portrayed brilliantly by Javier Bardem) it's hard to stop praising this movie. For the first time ever we get to see a Bond who is actually pretty rusty. Due to the events in the beginning of the film, Bond is trying to get back into the field at MI6 and has to go go through testing (which turns out to be not as easy as it once was for him) Bond is aging and a bit weathered and this film clearly portrays that. This however, by no means takes away from the elite killer and bad ass that he still clearly is. I felt that Daniel Craig stepped more into the character of Bond in this movie than in his previous Bond outings. Long time Bond fans will be sure to love a couple of throwback scenes and references from the old movies that are in Skyfall. I think in the end the main thing that really makes this movie work is Bond's connection with M. A major plot point of the movie is Bond protecting M, and exploring the sort of mother/son relationship the two of them have. As always Judi Dench is great as M and you really do see how deeply she cares for Bond in this movie. Another great thing about this movie is that the dialogue is just as engaging and interesting as the action. This is a very sharply written script, and I found that a lot of the character scenes were executed perfectly. The movie doesn't drag at all and keeps you interested the entire time. I really can't stop praising Skyfall. Craig is great, Bardem is flawless, I don't think one bad actor is in this movie. Skyfall is a must see Bond film that will leave you hoping and praying that the next film in Craig's series will be just as good or even better. Definitely see this in theaters if you get the chance to do so! 5/5",10,2,13,28 November 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Hands down the best Marvel movie since Iron Man.
","Yes I said it. I personally even enjoyed it more than Iron Man actually, because Captain America The First Avenger has much more to it than just great action sequences and a solid story. It has heart. The quiet confidence of star Chris Evans speaks the loudest without him even saying anything and ultimately, that's what makes this movie succeed more than anything else. I enjoyed Chris Evans performance so much in this film I kind of wish he had never played Johnny Storm from the Fantastic Four movies. He was just that good, and to me was born to play this role. Without a doubt he IS Captain America. The film is extremely well casted and Marvel may have just nailed their most frightening/menacing villain yet. Hugo Weaving plays the Red Skull who squares off against Captain America and who's motives tie into a previous Marvel Studio film. *hint hint.. Thor* This is also the very first Marvel Studio film without a rushed romance. The chemistry between Chris Evans and co-star Hayley Atwell oozes off screen and makes for Marvel Studios first believable romance. (I liked Thor's romance as well but compared to Captain America the romance in that felt too rushed) The movie really does a terrific job of making you feel for Steve Rogers before his transformation. I felt the skinny Steve scenes were the most meaningful and helped you to really connect with Steve after the transformation as well. The pacing of the movie is really well done. It never dragged once, and kept me interested and entertained the entire time. The action is also very fast-paced and slick, director Joe Johnston definitely knows how to work the camera around an action scene. The fights are very easy to distinguish and their are really no quick cuts or 'slow mo' scenes (which is director Zack Synder's forte.) and I really appreciated that. Overall I would give Captain America the First Avenger a 5/5 I just absolutely loved this film and cannot wait to see it again. It captures the spirit of old adventure classics and you can definitely see a bit of an influence from 'The Rocketeer' in this film. Go see it! Captain America is without a doubt the best comic book movie out this summer! I enjoyed it better than Thor and X-Men First Class (both which I loved as well) so that should definitely tell you something! See it in theaters while you have the chance!",10,16,40,20 July 2011
