It," Best movie in years - best Stephen King adaptation ever?
","I have waited and waited for this film to come out. Usually the problem with that is it's become something so amazing in my head the real life movie simply can't match the anticipation. That absolutely did not happen in this movie. This movie for me is simply excellent, perfect, spellbinding, horrifying, wonderful, funny and absolutely terrifying. I am very sceptical with Stephen King adaptations as for me the bad ones outweigh the good, so chances are this wouldn't have been any good but the film makers, actors, everyone involved in this plus of course the genius that is Stephen King should be very proud of such a fantastic movie. If I could go again tonight I would. And the next night. Bravo.",10,8,18,8 September 2017
