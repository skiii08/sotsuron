The Devil's Advocate," Really good thriller with strong message
","The devil's advocate was an amazing movie. I first decided to see it based on the reviews I read from IMDb. The movie was better than I expected. The movie, however, is not without flaws. The pace of the movie was one things that slightly bothered me. I felt the movie would have been slightly better if it moved a bit faster and had a little more action in it. The movie was still far above average. The end of the movie has a very depressing tone to it, but you never see the ending coming. The ending was very surprising. The isn't really scary, like some people have said, but it definitely freaks you out and makes you think. Overall 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,9 March 2005
Dawn of the Dead," One of the best zombie movies ever
","Out of all the horror movies I have bought this year, dawn of the dead is by far my favorite. I don't know if you could really classify dawn of the dead as a straight up horror movie, because it isn't scary. It is more of a suspenseful action movie if anything. The the makeup for the zombie's in the movie are so believable. I watched the special features for the DVD and they used people with real hadicaps as the zombies without arms or legs. The camera work looks like it is done with a hand held camera, you it puts you right in the middle of the action. Their is also enough blood, gore, and violence to satisfy both action and horror fans. The movie also does a great job of how people can turn on each other so quickly in times of crisis. Overall, i give this movie a 9 1/2.",9,0,0,18 January 2005
28 Days Later...," Good horror flick
","As far a zombie movies go, it is one of the best ones, but I would have to say that I enjoyed dawn of the dead a little more. 28 days later does have certain pros over other zombie movies. 28 days later contains a lot of very suspenseful moments and situations. I enjoyed how it accurately depicted how you would get on with your everyday life after such an event( one instance being they go into a deserted grocery store and go 'shopping'). The movie did have a few o.k. action scenes, it also had a pretty creative beginning. I rented the DVD with alternate endings, so I don't know which one they actually used in theaters, but both endings were pretty good. Overall, I give the movie a 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,20 January 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Way better than the 1st
","Resident evil 2 by far blows the first resident evil away. I'm not saying the first one is bad (i still recommend it) but the second one is better on so many levels. I think the 2nd one does a much better job of explaining the disease than the 1st. In the 2nd movie, you also get a wider and more colorful cast. All the cast in RE2 played their parts very well. The one thing that sets RE2 apart from the first is the action. RE2 is non stop action from start to finish. You also get a wider variety of enemies. In RE2, you get a much more varied environment than in the first movie (which took place entirely in the 'HIVE'). You also don't have to have seen the first one to appreciate the second movie. The RE2 gives a brief summary of the first movie in the beginning. The movie is sometimes labeled as horror, but that is very wrong. The movie is not at all suspenseful, which is one of its flaws. Overall RE2 is a good action movie that will satisfy your need for violence. 7 out of 10",7,1,2,20 January 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Not the best vampire movie
","I've read many reviews about the movie and most say that the two different stories within the movie just don't seem to connect very well. I don't really agree. I think the dramatic shift change made the movie more interesting, even though the shift change could have been made a smoother. The thing that brings the movie's rating down is the fact that the action gets really old after awhile. The action is in the EVIL DEAD style, but it just doesn't have the same way of keeping you entertained as it did in EVIL DEAD. The movie still isn't bad though. I would advise that you watch the movie because of the great PULP FICTION style dialog in the beginning of the movie. There are a bunch of really great lines. Overall, I give the movie a 6 1/2.",6,10,18,24 January 2005
