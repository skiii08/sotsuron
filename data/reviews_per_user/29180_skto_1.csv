Sucker Punch," good movie when you are bored ....
","just checked out sucker punch and i must say it was eye candy from start to finish. i would say that it incorporated some of the titles from past movies into the action scenes but tried to do its own thing by having over the top stylized action.this kind of film will please the die hard comic/gamer male or female... because out of that range it will be difficult to gain followers.the director has proved that he isn't afraid to take on an action film and could he be the successor of Michael bay in the future.... from this movie i believe he may walk down that road.pretty girls and action are what guys fantasize about and they will get that satisfaction. females will feel empowered by the sexy girls courage to stand up and fight. but will ,in my opinion, disregard the stunning 'fakeness' of the girls on screen.the review is right on IMDb.com 6/10 no more no less",Null,0,1,16 August 2011
