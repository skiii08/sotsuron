Lucky Number Slevin," - Film facts
","For the film geeks, I got some interesting facts about this film...On promotional material for the film, Ben Kingsley's credit included his honorary title. At first, the actor was singled out for some criticism as they usual are, from professional credits especially. It transpired that this was a mistake by a studio executive, who was unfamiliar with the British honors system. The movie's violence and style earned it comparisons with the work of director Quentin Tarantino. In Australia the film's release title is 'The Wrong Man'. This is the title of a 1956 Alfred Hitchcock film in which the lead character has a case of mistaken identity, a theme which many Hitchcock films as well as Lucky Number Slevin share. In fact the main character's plight in 'North by Northwest' is referenced in the movie as being similar to Slevin's. The film shares many similarities with Akira Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo', where a samurai plays two rival criminals against each other. Yojimbo was remade as Walter Hill's 'Last Man Standing' which also stars Bruce Willis in prohibition-era America. Bruce Willis' character Mr. Goodkat is also referred to as Smith, perhaps as an allusion to Willis' character in Last Man Standing, John Smith. This film is so genius that I can't write any more about it really.Written by, AKAJEF",10,3,6,2 January 2007
