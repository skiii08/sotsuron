The Sound of Music," Sometimes saccharine can be a good substitute.
","1965's 'The Sound of Music' is everything a bad musical should be. Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples, it has coy, silly songs, an inane, innocuous script, and unbelievably sugary characters.  So why is it one of my favorite musicals?  OK, go ahead.  Shoot me at twenty paces.  But after all this time, it still remains a guilty pleasure.  I find myself going for a tub of rocky road ice cream and Rodgers & Hammerstein's immortal classic whenever the real world gets to be too much.  I seem to play it a lot around tax time.And I'm not alone.  Why is it still considered the most popular musical of all time?  Well, first of all they spared no expense.  The extremely well-produced blockbuster has gorgeous, eye-popping scenery.  From the first moment Julie Andrews flails her arms and circles around on that beautiful sunny hillside singing the rousing title song, I know I'm being swept away to another world.  I'm not in Kansas anymore...or L.A., anyway.  The panoramic Salzburg background complements and never intimidates or takes away from the characters or their story (like the other R & H extravaganza 'South Pacific.')  That in itself is an incredible feat.Now about those songs.  Almost every one of them is absolute drivel.  So what makes them work?  Easy.  The utter joy and sincerity of the cast who sings the infectious, hummable tunes, which are backed by  extremely moving orchestrations and an exceptionally beautiful score.  It's hard to resist Maria prancing about, pillow-fighting with a bunch of knee-highs and gushing about her most favorite things.  Or the austere Captain Von Trapp (the meticulous Christopher Plummer) turning to butter after hearing his brood sing in perfect harmony for the first time (with no prior lessons even) and joining right in.  Or the Mother Superior's soaring number that unknowingly forewarns Maria to head for the hills (I mean, mountains) before the Nazis escort them elsewhere.  Or the 16-year-old going on 17 squealing with delight after receiving her first kiss.  Or the kids working up a clever little ditty to leave their formal party guests when its time for bed.  Or two people declaring their love in a moonlit gazebo.  The songs work because they come straight from and aim for the heart, not the head, which is exactly the place the viewer should be coming from when watching this movie. If the songs don't transcend the script (which they didn't prior to the 70s), they certainly transcend the mood.The script is undeniably trite and probably the film's weakest link.  But again, the characters play it straight all the way.  Not one actor looks embarrassed.  Every scene is done with total enthusiasm and total commitment, and the performers who are telling the story are pitch-perfect and picture perfect. And as for the characters.  Try and think of anybody better than jubilant, crop-haired Julie Andrews as a postulant nun who has gorgeous pipes, can make play clothes out of curtains, can set up and operate marionette shows at the drop of a hat, and is confident enough to convince a man that a failed nun is ideal marriage material.  I certainly can't.  Thank heavens for her Oscar-winning 'Mary Poppins' the year before or we might have gotten Julie LONDON instead!  After all, Andrews did lose out on 'My Fair Lady' the year before.  But now  certifiably bankable, she proved she could handle this dream role.  Andrews is cutely silly, cutely stubborn, cutely astute, cutely shattered and cutely...well, cute.  She gives the most wholesomely appealing musical perf since Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz.'  To actually make you forget Mary Martin in the Broadway role takes some doing and she does it effortlessly.  Christopher Plummer is all seriousness, handsomely patrician, and quite a catch for anybody...much less a nun.  I can't think of anyone more suitable for this role either.  As for the Seven Little Foys, I mean the Von Trapp children, they are adorable and perfect in their own ways too, whether they are marching or singing,  creating their own individual personalities by film's end.Richard Haydn as Max and Eleanor Parker as the flamboyant, haughty Baroness provide wonderful catty relief.  Despite having their musical numbers snatched away from them, they make up for it with droll, sophisticated humor.  The elegant, perfectly coiffed Parker is particularly delicious as Maria's chief romantic rival, getting some of the film's best zingers and delivering them with biting understatement.  Parker developed a devout cult following after this role.  Peggy Wood's Mother Superior is suitably reverent and inspiring.For those who tear 'The Sound of Music' apart for its shameless, sugar-coated manipulations, well, I can respect that.  But to attack it for its political and historical inaccuracies is like attacking 'Peter Pan' for being a subversive plot that encourages young children to run away from home.  It's ludicrous.  Despite the fact that it's based on a true story, we're not watching 'The Sound of Music' for stark realism.  Like a sparkling and lavish Ernst Lubitsch operetta, we want a feel-good movie, with feel-good songs, with a feel-good story, and a feel-good ending.  Nothing more.  If you want a movie that presents a potent depiction of pre-war Austria or anti-Nazi sentiment, rent 'Holocaust' or 'Schindler's List.' Here, we want to believe that a group of nuns can tear out an automobile carburetor and save the world!  Period.I suppose the reality-based MTV generation cannot truly respect or relate to the relative innocence and pure escapism like 'The Sound of Music.'  If this movie was made today I'm afraid the Von Trapp children would not be dangling out of trees for fear of drive-by shooters.  It's a tough new world today, sad to say.  The 50s and 60s are looking better all the time.Anyway, for what it's worth, 'The Sound of Music' is indeed schmaltz, but its QUALITY schmaltz at its very, very best.",9,136,222,31 March 2001
Moulin Rouge!," One colossal little love story.
","The vivid, vibrant, highly graphic strokes and style of French impressionist Toulouse-Lautrec was inspired by the colorful night life of the Montmartre district of Paris -- the circuses, the brothels(!), but notably the Moulin Rouge cabaret which he frequented often and became a routine host to an elite, partygoing bunch of artistic intellects and deviants.  Were he alive today, he could very well have been reinspired by this ambitious recreation of the Moulin Rouge 100 years later.  A mammoth, toyingly libidinous piece of escapism to be certain, the painter would simply revel in the outre, over-the-top, visually assaultive mind of its creator writer/director Baz Luhrmann.I, too, was quite bowled over by this 'everything but the kitchen sink' extravaganza, although not always as ecstatically as I would have wanted to be, but certainly enough to appreciate the intentions of this masterful deluge of gaudy Gallic grandeur circa 1899.Refreshingly original (the previews had me fooled), what did NOT race through my categorical mind while experiencing this film!  In its initial stage, the love story seemed to borrow its concept directly from Christopher Isherwood's 'Berlin Stories,' specifically the Sally Bowles 'Cabaret'-inspired chapter in which a naive, struggling writer recalls (via his typewriter) his doomed love affair with a capricious entertainer who got caught up in the phony glitz and decadent glamour around her.  But from then on, it was anybody's guess.  A potpourri of other musical shows and films flashed through my mind --from the typical (Jose Ferrer's 'Moulin Rouge,' 'Can-Can,' 'Les Girls,' 'An American in Paris') to the more imaginative and surreal ('Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' 'Blade Runner,' 'Fellini Satyricon,' Fosse's 'All That Jazz,' the phantasmagorical 'Yellow Submarine', anything Gilbert & Sullivan-ish, and Disney's 'Aladdin').  Don't even ask me why on some of these.Nicole Kidman's Satine could have easily been based on the life of the indelible French star Renee Adoree, a one-time circus performer who became a Folies Bergere dancer.  She subsequently was ushered to Hollywood and illuminated one classic love story, 'The Big Parade' with John Gilbert, that remains a silent screen treasure.  A frail beauty, Renee died in her mid-30s of tuberculosis/consumption.Once the incessant battering by the camera's eye took a breather and I was allowed to actually focus on something tangible -- like the love story -- I found the enticing, highly photogenic Kidman, coupled with Ewan McGregor's honest-guy Christian, to be quite affecting as a pair, even moving.  And that wasn't easy.  The visual bombardment and gimmicky use of modern songs constantly threaten to isolate the viewer from the film's emotional core. Fortunately, it did not succeed.Speaking of, the use of contemporary pop and classic rock songs worked better at the beginning when it was a novelty but, of course, the pattern eventually wore out its welcome as I started spending my time ingenously thinking about what next classic hit should be used for the present scene -- much like the so-so musical 'Mamma Mia!' wherein a series of Abba songs are thrown together (very weakly) to create a ridiculous storyline.  I thought the 'Material Girl' number (despite the engaging presence of Jim Broadbent's bombastic impresario, Zidler, and Richard Roxburgh's oily villain, the Duke of Worchester) was stretching a potential good idea too far.  However, Kidman's breathy song stylings and, especially, McGregor's sturdy pop tenor handled the love songs quite effectively.As for the handling of simple little love stories, however, I sincerely hope Luhrmann doesn't get any ideas by setting his sights on a remake of 'The Fantasticks.'  I don't think the fragile little story could take it!",8,1,1,2 June 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," Must see cult film -- still has bite and humor.
","Trendy, well done 'rockumentary' as director Rob Reiner interviews and accompanies former rave Spinal Tap, now an un-hip, dispirited British metal band on the last legs of a hardly formidable American tour, all the while seeing its audiences shrink and age, the gigs get progressively shaggier, and the whole thing grind to a near halt.This winning send-up of the rock world is, to be sure, much more hit than miss.  Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer (also script and music co-writers, along with Reiner) have the time of their lives while giving right-on-the-mark perfs as the brain-fried band members who are suffering the usual indignities of a band slowly going down for the last count.  Hilarious squabblings over bad album covers, cheap set props, and poor management, along with informal comments on the direction of the band, their image, promo parties, and scheduling headaches get the full treatment, satirizing every cliche there is.  The boys themselves present riveting Jagger-like stances, attitudes and accents that go beyond real.  The backstage haps and 'concert' footage, in particular have real bite.Favorite bits:  Guest and his 11-volume control amplifier, Fred Willard greeting a very unenthused band to his military base fete; Shearer getting pinned inside a futuristic prop piece; and McKean's all-out raunchy vocals.
A cult favorite over the years, the cutting edge humor has dulled a bit, becoming more and more a time capsule piece as time goes by, but that alone is probably the best reason now to see it, just to find out what all the buzz was about when this first came out in 1984.Guest, of course, went on to create two other highly successful 'mockumentaries' -- 'Waiting for Guffman' and 'Best in Show.'",8,0,1,19 April 2001
Some Like It Hot," Billy Wilder's screwball masterpiece with Curtis, Lemmon and the immortal Marilyn handed the best comedy roles of their careers.
","Admittedly biased, 'Some Like It Hot' can certainly stand on its own merit with or without my thunderous round of applause.  More than a decade ago, I had the privilege of performing both the Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon roles in 'Sugar,' the musical adaptation of 'Some Like It Hot' which originally starred Tony Roberts, Robert Morse and Elaine Joyce on Broadway in the 70s. Though it hardly compares to the film's original (how could it???), the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences.  I can't remember ever having a better time on stage than I did with 'Sugar,' and it's all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated it all.In the 1959 classic, Curtis and Lemmon play two ragtag musicians scraping to make ends meet in Prohibition-era Chicago during the dead of winter who accidentally eyewitness a major gangland rubout (aka the St. Valentine's Day Massacre).  Barely escaping with their lives (their instruments aren't quite as lucky), our panicky twosome is forced to take it on the lam.  Scared out of their shoes (sorry), the boys don heels and dresses after they connect with an all-girl orchestra tour headed for sunny Florida.  Killing two birds with one stone, they figure why not go south for the winter while dodging the mob?  Once they hit the coast, they'll ditch both the band and their humiliating outfits.  Enter a major detour in the form of  luscious Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane, given one of the sexiest (yet innocent) entrances ever afforded a star. Snugly fit in flashy 'Jazz Age' threads, a blast from the locomotive's engine taunts her incredible hour-glass figure as she rushes to catch her train to Florida.  The boys, stopped dead in their high-heeled tracks by this gorgeous vision, decide maybe the gig might not be so bad after all. As the totally unreliable but engagingly free-spirited vocalist/ukelele player for the band, Sugar gets instantly chummy with the 'girls' when they cover for her after getting caught with a flask of booze.  As things progress, complications naturally set in - playboy Curtis falls for Monroe but has his 'Josephine' guise to contend with, while Lemmon's 'Daphne' has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire.  What results is an uproarious Marx Brothers-like farce with mistaken identities, burlesque-styled antics, and a madcap chase finale, all under the exact supervision of director Billy Wilder, who also co-wrote the script.  Lemmon and Curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team, you almost wish THEY ended up together! Curtis does a dead-on Cary Grant imitation while posing as a Shell Oil millionaire to impress Marilyn; Lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous Joe E. Brown (who also gets to deliver the film's blue-ribbon closing line).  As for the immortal Monroe, she is at her zenith here as the bubbly, vacuous, zowie-looking flapper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Despite her gold-digging instincts, Monroe's Sugar is cozy, vulnerable and altogether loveable, getting a lot of mileage too out of her solo singing spots, which include the kinetic 'Running Wild,' the torchy 'I'm Through With Love,' and her classic 'boop-boop-a-doop' signature song, 'I Wanna Be Loved by You.'The film is dotted with fun, atmospheric characters.   Pat O'Brien and George Raft both get to spoof their Warner Bros. stereotypes as cop vs. gangster, Joan Shawlee shows off a bit of her stinger as the by-the-rules bandleader Sweet Sue, Mike Mazurki overplays delightfully the archetypal dim-bulbed henchman, and, if I'm not mistaken, I think that's young Billy Gray of 'Father Knows Best' fame (the role is not listed in the credits) playing a snappy, pint-sized bellhop who comes on strong with the 'girls.'For those headscratchers who can't figure out why the so-called 'mild' humor of 'Some Like It Hot' is considered such a classic today, I can only presume that they have been brought up on, or excessively numbed by, the graphic, mindless toilet humor of present-day 'comedies.'  There was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity - it relied on wit, timing, inventiveness and suggestion - not shock or gross-out value.  It's the difference between Sid Caesar and Andrew 'Dice' Clay; between Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon and Chris Farley and David Spade; between 'I Love Lucy' and 'Married With Children'; between Lemmon's novel use of maracas in the hilarious 'engagement' sequence, and Cameron Diaz's use of hair gel in a scene that ANYBODY could have made funny.  Jack Lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props.  While 'Some Like It Hot' bristles with clever sexual innuendo, today's 'insult' comedies are inundated with in-your-face sexual assault which, after awhile, gets quite tiresome -- lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination.  I still have hope...Having ultimate faith in my fellow film devotees, THAT is why 'Some Like It Hot' will (and should be) considered one of THE screwball classics of all time, and why most of today's attempts will (and should be) yesterday's news.",10,234,298,18 April 2001
Psycho," Hitchcock's landmark horror that led to a slew of slayers.
","This is the 1960 culprit that catapulted the horror film to an altogether new and gruesome plateau.  It's the ship that launched a thousand blood-spurting imitators, although that was never Alfred Hitchcock's intent. Unfortunately, 90 per cent of those writers and directors inspired by his unprecedented work in 'Psycho' never got past the initial primitive thrill of seeing on-screen violence for the first time.  They didn't 'get' the homework that went into this brilliantly macabre masterpiece.  Just what DID make the infamous shower scene and 'Mother' Bates' stairwell confrontation so shockingly memorable, other than providing front row forum seats to the carnage?With 'Psycho,' the master of suspense would tempt us to enter the intricate, insidious mind of a violent, psychotic killer, something he surely tampered around with in 'Strangers On a Train.'  Hitch himself created the essential tool kit for modern day terror  implementing story, set-up, characterization, photography, camera technique, mood and music in order to weave an elaborate spider's web that would playfully entice, then seduce his intended victim, the audience.Norman Bates will forever be enshrined as THE infamous poster boy of cinematic psychosis.  As expounded by Simon Oakland's psychiatrist in the last reel, Norman was an isolated, terrified, severely undernourished man-child consumed by a hideously abnormal fear of change.  In the end, the self-suffocating Norman lashed out like a wild, kicking, screaming child at a world he never knew or understood.  Smart enough to distance himself and the Bates Motel as far from the highway of humanity as possible, it still wasn't far enough.  For somewhere down the line, fate, coincidence, or maybe just a primal need for human contact, would inevitably lead a John Doe (or Marion Crane) to his door.The most compelling scene for me is when the verrrrrry brave Lila Crane sneaks into the decrepit Bates' house behind the motel to investigate her suspicions as to sister Marion's disappearance.  After coyly tormenting us throughout the first three-fourths of the movie, Hitch finally lets us in on the equally decrepit world of Norman Bates and his mother.  Norman's bedroom holds the key elements to his enslaved childhood.  The pathetic little bed with his careworn stuffed animal nearby, the little phonograph with Beethoven's 'Eroica' record in place.  It's such a private, eerily invasive moment that one feels guilty for possessing this natural Peeping Tom' curiosity.Seeing Norman huddled up looking maniacally serene, immured within the confines of a 'new' prison and armed only with a security blanket, you know that the poor innocent fly that lands on his hand, a fly he promises to respect, will never see the light of day again.  And neither will Norman...despite the inferior sequels that tried to alter his obvious fate.We can only thank Anthony Perkins for sacrificing a brilliant, promising, and highly versatile film career after bestowing upon us the most definitive, sympathetic creature of violence ever to assault the eyes. There will never be another one like him.  Janet Leigh, one of Hollywood's biggest, fluffiest stars at this juncture, graciously cut short a dramatic 'starring' role and instead offered us the screen's most tragic golden girl of all time.  Both of their sacrifices were rewarded with film immortality.I was introduced to 'Psycho' at the age of 9.  My older brother and I had the option one night of seeing 'Psycho' or Jerry Lewis' 'Cinderfella' at the local Riviera Theater.  I wanted Jerry Lewis but my older brother had clout and, of course, won out.  Needless to say I lost a good portion of my innocence (and my hair!) that night, succumbing to the frequent nightmares and shower traumas that obviously accompany such a youthful experience.  Oh, yes, there is that abnormal fear I developed of screeching violin strings...On a bright note, my faith in today's horror suspense was restored after experiencing the bravura Shyamalan-directed 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Blair Witch Project' a raw, but creepy and effective little thriller filmed on a pittance.  Both took stock of Hitchcock's tool kit for terror.  'Blair Witch' proves once again that the real horror of shock films today lie not in its low-grade budgets, but in its third-grade scripts and mentality.Alfred Hitchcock opened our eyes in awe, wonderment and, yes, horror.  But never in disgust.  And he never sacrificed his story or characters for the sake of shock.  We can only apologize for all the gratuitous 'Friday the Thirteenth' and 'Halloween' dreck that rose out of his ashes.",10,1,3,28 April 2001
To Kill a Mockingbird," Warm, beautifully-realized piece of Americana, and now a part of Hollywood's treasured classics.
","The warmth and affection generated by Kim Stanley's brilliant, thoughtful narration in the Oscar-winning 'To Kill a Mockingbird' couldn't capture better the essence of Harper Lee's semi-autobiographical novel.  I could swear hers is the inner voice I heard when I first read this book as a young teen.A woman recaptures a single childhood summer during the Great Depression, a period she recalls with great fondness despite the difficult times. As seen through the eyes of an impressionable tomboy (nicknamed 'Scout'), the story, set in a drowsy, dusty Alabama community, initially centers comfortably around typical adolescent escapades, until the town is jarred by a grown-up incident in which an indigent black man is accused of raping a white woman. Scout's widower father is given the daunting, disputatious assignment of representing the already condemned man.Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is exemplary as the father we wished for as a child.  A tower of quiet strength, he is a man of utmost integrity, a steady voice of logic and reason, a man of disciplined, yet tender reserve.  A father you can count on to defend you against mad dogs or pervasive demons that disturb your sleep at night.  Too perfect?  Maybe.  But in that perfection Atticus represents everything we aspire not only in ourselves, but for mankind as well.  He is a reassuring factor that man, in spite of his flaws, is innately good and decent -- his saintliness accentuated by his offspring's loving reflection.  Peck's utter sincerity in this role is never doubtful for a minute.  And for once his sometimes stiff, sobering demeanor meshes beautifully with a character that has become his signature piece.
The superbly talented 'young 'uns', Mary Badham and Philip Alford, play the children Scout and Jem.  They may not have had longevity in their acting careers, but here they make an everlasting imprint with performances so natural, triggering sweet memories of our own lost innocence.  Their simple joys and fears are exquisitely realized and instantly become our own.  They and the late John Megna, as their rather frail, awkward summer-time friend, touch the heart with their simple discoveries, theories and revelations.
The trial aspects may seem overblown by today's standard but the dramatic tension and poignancy is not lost.  Brock Peters gives a deeply felt performance as defendant Tom Robinson, a man rife with fear, yet able to muster shaky courage and dignity throughout his ordeal.  On the other side of the coin, James Anderson gives despicable meaning to the term 'poor white trash' as the bigoted, redneck father of a piteous rape victim, played with neurotic intensity by Collin Wilcox.  Atticus's closing argument and the trial's denouement are only two of many highlights, with Peck's speech one of cinema's most memorable soliloquies.  Slow-minded recluse Arthur Radley, who is taunted by the nickname 'Boo' (a compelling Robert Duvall), serves to represent the fear in all of us...fear of the unknown.  He becomes a phantom-like symbol for those who have ever been unfairly judged or persecuted due to prejudice, gossip, opinion, and/or ignorance.  His final scene with Scout remains etched in my mind. Director Robert Mulligan evokes welcoming sentiment without the saccharine in this sensitive Horton Foote adaptation.  'To Kill a Mockingbird' never fails to open my heart, mind and tear ducts.A triumph of the human spirit.  It is a treasure to be sure.",10,0,1,23 May 2001
