Blade Runner 2049," A rich, contemplative, but ultimately lesser sequel to 'Blade Runner'
","I am a fan of the original 'Blade Runner': its groundbreaking work on visual sci-fi is an incredible achievement, even though it's a tad overestimated on its conceptual aspects. On the contrary, '2049' lacks a true stylistic coherence but it's much richer in ideas and its interesting (although slow to the excess) pace in the first half is then replaced with too much standard blockbuster action in the second. '2049' can hardly be considered a true sequel to the original, as it brings out a world of its own: a very different -if extremely beautiful- cinematography, that ultimately hides, behind the constant layers of smog and fog, an inferior attention to stylistic details. The amazing world where Deckard moves is only hinted at with a couple of great shots, but there's lack of the subtle pop culture elements that make the original a work of genius. The same could be said for the music score: while Vangelis's electronic compositions were spot on to channel the mood of futuristic Los Angeles, Zimmer's is a more generic series of sounds without melody that increase the sense of unease very well, but without the same personality. Gosling, coming from the success of 'La La Land' is a great lead and the cast as a whole is filled with superstars and unexpected returns, more or less welcome; Villeneuve has always worked in the realm of the cryptic and profound, and with '2049' he does it again, simply not matching the original's uniquely personal style. 8/10",8,0,4,7 November 2017
Vertigo," Hitchcock crafts a near perfect movie which is much more than a mystery
","'Vertigo' is considered by some the greatest movie ever made, and while I find impossible to give that definition to any movie, I see why it's praised so much. To date I have watched three Hitchcock movies: 'Rebecca', 'The Birds' and 'Psycho'. None of the three fulfilled my expectations: I see the modernity and sometimes brilliant solutions by the author, but they always felt overpraised to me. Maybe after 'Vertigo' I'll have to watch them again and understand the depth I sensed in this one. Is it a mystery movie? Yes, but only on the surface. Like any masterpiece, this film has a number of levels of interpretation: the plain mystery, solved at 3/4 of the movie; Scottie's spiral into madness, man's need for control over life and death, the meaning of colour to address emotions. These are just a few examples of just how multifaceted 'Vertigo' can be, evolving from the original script into a real work of art. This might very well be the best example to show how Hitchcock managed to craft popular movies with a (heavy!) authorial touch for those who can grasp it.I also loved James Stuart's performance from likableness, through catatonic depression into obsessive maniacal behaviour, and keeping a continuity in his character only the greatest actors can achieve. Kim Novak, just like every other Hitchcock girl, is not my favourite on screen, but can always get the right intensity and sex appeal necessary.",9,6,7,26 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The biggest disappointment in the galaxy
","Making a comparison between the first film of the original trilogy of 'Star Wars' and the first one of the prequels is just heartbreaking. Where there was fun and wit, there are dumb, flat, B-comedy jokes. Where there were fantastic characters there are weak, poor and sometimes irritating characterizations that make you hate the new ones and even the old ones in their new guise. 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' is easily the most disappointing film ever, considering the hype and hope that everybody had at the time to see something that could stand between the originals. I usually say that the prequels can't be canon, they must be considered a fan fiction that someone started as a kid (Episode I), then continued as a frustrated emo teenager (Episode II) and ended as a disillusioned adult (Episode III). Jokes aside -if that is to be considered a joke-, it's very hard for a fan to not get angry at all this mess. Story-wise, the introduction of a scientific reason behind the Force is a gigantic mistake, as it takes away all of the magic aura the concept was surrounded by. Character-wise, Ana-kid is unbearable and his final act is so random you'd hope you never saw it, while the others are barely easier to sympathize with, also thanks to some of the most wooden performances by otherwise good actors. The baddies in this one are most significantly represented by the honestly good looking Darth Maul, but his haunting looks are not supported by an adequate personality, which is as thin as paper. Even the music is not as good as before, consolidating my idea that John Williams perfectly molds his soundtracks on the movie, for better or for worse. Let's take a breath, though, and evaluate the silver linings. The massive CGI use is still impressive, with a number of strange and imaginative creatures and vehicles (in the best Star Wars tradition), with kinda-exciting scenes where characters shut up and let the computer graphics entertain. And, fortunately, they do. So, although I hate when that happens, special effects and a little imagination on Lucas's side help the otherwise messed up movie.Your best course with 'The Phantom Menace' is to get excited for those great, imaginative worlds and effects and to forget the rest. 6/10",6,0,6,26 January 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Fan service, fan service...
","'Rogue One' is the first of (probably) many side installments in the form of films in the Star Wars universe. Its reason of being is clear and, for once, legitimate: to explain how Leia got the info about a weakness in the Death Star and how to destroy it. Decades of discussions spun out of what many called a plot-hole, but which happens to be closed by this film. I won't get into the details because f*ck spoilers, but what they came up with is a half-satisfactory reason, which makes half-sense after thinking about it. Everything surrounding this purpose is more or less the basic plot of any blockbuster introducing 'new' characters: the tough girl, tough boy, a funny stooge (as any SW film, a droid), and a few others. Actually, it's the few others that make for an enjoyable bunch, as Jyn Erso and (especially!) Cassian Andor are some of the most linear characters I've seen in some time; on the other hand, Chirrut, Baze and K2, while not being especially memorable, are fun to watch and get to you on the long run. The plot itself is nothing special: just another shoot-out, another space battle, another base infiltration, same old, same old. Also, two great actors such as Mads Mikkelsen and Forest Whitaker are criminally underused for criminally badly written characters. Only the final moments of the movie are particularly well staged, with an ending that managed to shock me -and, thus, please me- quite a bit.When watching a sci-fi and more specifically a Star Wars entry, special effects and awe-inspiring visuals are vital. And 'Rogue One' might very well be THE best one yet on this account, even surpassing Episode VII. A pretty bad story is structured so that the most awesome scenes could be made, and they are just as incredible as they should. Maybe the classic space battle near the end of the film could've been slightly better staged, though. There are two characters from the original trilogy that come back for this movie in the splendor of CGI: the one taking some time on screen is so well made that I could hardly realize it wasn't an actual person. The other, appearing at the very end, SUCKS TERRIBLY. He/she looks like a play dough doll, really shameful.With its highs and lows, 'Rogue One' is not an extremely memorable Star Wars film, being better than the prequel trilogy (and that is no hard task, if you ask me), but worse than any other (and that is not strange either). Hopeful and excited for next year's Episode VIII!",8,1,5,16 December 2016
Aquaman," Classic intro to a new superhero that shoots every single bullet available
","I've been a superhero comics fan my whole life, so I was extremely excited at the idea of Aquaman having a legitimate movie of his own, less so that it would be in the low-quality context of the DCEU.First off, Momoa was a great casting choice for the man himself: he has the energy and looks to actually make a lesser superhero very charismatic nonetheless. The problem comes with almost everything else: the other members of the cast have nothing interesting to give their characters, not even the 'queen' herself Nicole Kidman, and the plot is... just a mess. It's a fun mess, but a mess still. What I mean is that Aquaman has an interesting mythos, but also a limited one: the authors managed to stuff the plot with Orm, Manta, the War between Land and Sea, the trial of the Trident AND the Trench, a newer and awesome addition to the canon of recent years. Now, this has consequences: the story makes no sense, of course, but this has to be taken into account when watching a superhero flick (a DC superhero flick, rather); the story is so absurd it's fun and funny: I found myself laughing at some of the most bombastic and/or cliche scenes, but this is not necessarily a bad thing; last, but not least: this makes it incredibly hard for a sequel to happen. I know DC is already considering throwing away the whole project, and I'm honestly happy with that, but the team could've focused on fewer plot points, delivering a sharper, shorter film, instead of burning every cartridge with a long and messy one.",6,3,5,12 January 2019

Thor: Ragnarok," Hiddleston/Hemsworth fun-pack
","What 'Thor: Ragnarok' explicitly states is a doomsday catastrophe going on; what it really does is reinvigorate a dying cinematic hero with the power of comedy. Who would've known that the Thor universe could have so much comedic effect in the right hands, and that it would be the right direction for such a traditionally serious character. So that is the good aspect of this new Thor, which also happens to be the best of the three; the bad is that, unfortunately, even the creative Taika Waititi can't upset the tired Marvel formula of filling too many scenes with mindless action. It's not like action scenes are bad per se, as they are perfectly rendered in other recent MCU films like 'Homecoming' or 'Civil War': they just don't fit in this story as they would elsewhere because they ruin the flow of the story. The story itself is nothing special: just a series of bad guys to give Thor someone to punch or characters from other Marvel brands to team up with. Some of said team-ups are really cool and/or unexpected, and yes, my man Stan Lee has a funny cameo in this one as well. As most people know, the main side-kick of Thor's in this one is the Incredible Hulk. Although they may not be the most sympathetic of characters in the Marvel Universe, it's undeniable that Waititi does a good job of making them fun, at least until they are bound to save Asgard in the customary final big fight. The main villain is a new entry in the MCU: Thor's sister Hela, the goddess of Death, played by a slick Cate Blanchett with a less slick headgear. Her character starts strong, but as the film goes on her personality gets flattened and it's ultimately relieving to see her go to Hel. It is very clear that Disney knows how well received her Star Wars characters have been and it's trying to reformulate them in this Norse context. One can clearly see Han Solo's disinterest, confidence and ultimately reformation in the amazing Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, or Jabba the Hut's careless cruelty in Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster; both actors did incredible jobs on this one, by the way. If it seems that this whole mess may be any fun, yes it is indeed, and its icing on the cake is the fantastic Korg, voiced by Waititi himself, and, even with his limited screen time, one of the best additions to the show. But again, it's the action pieces that really show how handcuffed the author is here, not being able to completely liberate his comedic genius by force of contractual restraints. I would've liked a completely different Marvel movie, but I know it's kind of a non-possibility. Nevertheless, he's able to save the movie with his outstanding witty dialogues, from which the first beneficiary is Chris Hemsworth, proving himself a better comic than he is a dramatic actor. His timing and delivery are simply perfect and it shows from the get go, when our hero is chained from the wall of Surtur's cave. Those chains he frees himself from are the token of him getting rid of his upright persona and finally able to behave the way he does best: having fun. And it only gets better as the next scene is one of the most hilarious in the whole movie: Thor realizing that Odin is actually his brother Loki while watching a Shakespeare-like play of his heroic death in battle. Loki himself, as expected, plays a core part in the film, and he has as effective comedic pieces as everyone else. 'Thor Ragnarok' really works under many aspects: for a change we get a memorable soundtrack, also graced by 'Immigrant Song', that really works in the context it's put in. It's a shame that the MCU format demands mindless, useless action at all costs, because outside that downgrade, this could've been the comedy of the year. 7.5/10",8,11,19,8 November 2017
Snatch," Guy Ritchie at his worst
","Mind you, I didn't hate this movie completely. There actually are some fun parts and a great performance by Brad Pitt. All the rest is a tiresome gangster comedy with little fantasy, mediocre dialogs and average to bad performances. While I usually defend Ritchie's bombastic style-over-substance philosophy, this time around he really bombed.",6,1,2,18 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A fitting end to a wonderful trilogy
","Every movie addict loves the original 'Star Wars' trilogy and many of them consider it the perfect three-film experience. I'm totally okay with that, although I can't say that 'Episode VI' is as good as its predecessors, which is fine considering how good the previous films are. 'Return of the Jedi' is one hell of an entertaining experience, but I think it lost some of the genius in the writing to deliver a politically correct ending to an overall family friendly saga. Awkwardly enough in this movie there are some of my favorite scenes in the trilogy (the revelation of how Luke and Leia are connected; the showdown with Jabba's crew; the epic fight between Luke, Vader and the Emperor) and some of the worst (the introduction to Jabba's palace; the Ewoks), and still every scene feels like it needs to be there and (just like its two predecessors) like it is essential sci-fi adventure film. For all the cheesiness and plot-holes that can be there, 'Star Wars' is one of those cinematic miracles that you love no matter what rationality induces you to think, because art works exactly that way, more on an emotional level that on a cerebral one. So, I can't rate 'Return of the Jedi' as high as the other two films, but with the note that I love it just as well.Despite its flaws, 'Episode VI' gets you just as well. 8/10",7,0,0,25 January 2016
Barry Lyndon," The life of an Irish scoundrel
","'Barry Lyndon' is a coming-of-age story with the Kubrick touch, so nothing you've ever seen before. It is the story of an Irish boy whose life takes him to roads he'd never think he'd get in, nor does the viewer. Instead of the classic story of growth and overcoming of one's own limits, with 'Barry Lyndon' Kubrick gives us his customary pessimistic view over the need for control of the human beings over fate or, in other words, the unfathomable number of variables that can change one's life in an instant. Almost comically, the viewer gets used to Barry's continuous shifts from luck to bad fortune in the first half hour, so that the rest of the (long) movie can be played with both the author and the addressee conscious of the rules. The setting in the XVIII century cannot be random: Kubrick alludes to that historic age in almost everyone of his films because it's the purest moment of coexistence of reason and passion, reality and staged society, some of the director's most beloved themes.Kubrick's attention to detail and maniacal perfection in cinematography could even make the movie unbearable for some. Every single shot in three hours of film are blatantly studied and show conceitedly how amazingly the light is used throughout the scenes: most shots are filmed solely with the use of natural light and/or candles, something any other film-maker would've thought utterly impossible (and it would have been, if Kubrick hadn't had the permission to use new lenses produced by NASA!). There is a continuous use of reverse zoom to 'paint' in front of the audience's eyes pictures which reveal more of the scene as the lens widens. The use of music is also noticeable, with classic tunes employed for superb emotionally resonant editing cuts (I'm thinking about a specific one near the end about Barry's child).'Barry Lyndon' is where the audience can see how one of Kubrick's greatest talents was to mold his actors into the kind of actors needed for a specific film. In this one, every single character has a certain immobility to him, as if an actual painting was brought to life just as long as it is necessary for the narration. Many scenes are simply frozen, with just one character talking or doing something, and even then the movements are perfectly calibrated and artificial, as if instead of actors Kubrick bought machines for his film. This rule is suddenly broken in moments of rage or pain where the camera becomes shaky and the scene confused too.'Barry Lyndon' is a fantastic example of Kubrick's maniacal perfection in shooting and between his best works, although not as emotionally or intellectually groundbreaking as his VERY best.",8,3,5,18 January 2017

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An improvement over Episode I
","Everyone knows that the prequel trilogy in the 'Star Wars' universe is light-years far from the magical results George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan managed to pull off with the originals. However, I'm not inclined -like many hardcore fans- to completely destroy these movies as if they were some of the worst results in the history of cinema, and with Episode II, which I consider the halfway between the pretty bad I and the pretty good III, I have the chance to explain why. This film starts off as a pretty boring one, making the viewer fear for the worst, but as the plot progresses it shows its interesting political points and some impressive CGI scenes, if you consider that in the early 2000s this technology was the life itself for action/adventure motion pictures. It surely lacks the wonderfully amusing relationships and characters that developed in the originals (except C3PO and R2-D2, who are lovely as usual and are used in a more active way than 'Episode I'), and the 'love story' between Anakin and Padmé is good only as a script, but fails on the actual complicity between the lead actors, who seem ashamed of taking on a romantic scene. That's one of the big problems here: Hayden Christensen is an awful actor and the single worst choice in the whole series of films also considering the key character he's entrusted with. Obviously he can't take all of the blame, as the man who should have directed him and the others in the right way apparently does nothing to help, with no acting direction at all (I hope!) and uninspired shots. That said, I will save this flick and brand it as an enjoyable one, when not considering the let-down you get knowing what kind of masterpieces George Lucas had been able to invent in the past (with the evidently needed help of his brilliant collaborators).Give up your anticipation for great characters and enjoy the great fights, chases and (titular) wars. 7/10",7,1,4,22 January 2016
Bird Box," Average Post-Apocalyptic Flick
","The 2010s have been flooded with post-apocalyptic movies and TV shows, the most popular and iconic arguably being 'The Walking Dead'. What Bird Box tries to do is nothing new -at all-, from the formulaic characters to the good-hearted, moralistic drama. The acting is quite solid, though, with a great cast being part of the project and Trevante Rhodes being the highlight: I absolutely loved him in a much, much better written film ('Moonlight'), but he makes do with the script here as well.",6,0,4,10 January 2019
The Revenant," 'Birdman' was just the beginning.
","Alejandro González Iñárritu's career in Hollywood is going pretty well nowadays: only at the 2015 Academy Awards he won three Oscars for directing, producing and writing 'Birdman', and as if that wasn't enough, he's back one year later with another incredible piece of cinema, longing to take home a few more statuettes and to make history as the first director winning twice in a row the biggest award in cinema. Watching his new work, 'The Revenant', there's little to argue about his deserving the price: every scene is studied in the most impacting way possible, and sometimes you get to wonder how did he manage to shoot a piece in a certain way that appears to break the laws of physics. Sure thing, his camera work is supported by the unparalleled cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who already worked for Iñárritu in 'Birdman' and for fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuaròn in 'Gravity'), whose use of light makes this movie not only an engaging survival adventure, but one that can also be enjoyed for its views and landscapes only. The story may be considered the weak part of the project, as it isn't particularly inventive (at least until the last few sequences) and maybe exceeds sometimes in giving some sort of invincibility to the protagonist, but it works perfectly with the other components and it's hard to imagine how else it should have been unraveled once the film is finished. Speaking of the protagonist, Leonardo DiCaprio may have found the role that will finally let him enter the Oscars family: his turn is incredibly real, brutal and painful, his voice is raspy and hardly recognizable and his physicality has changed a lot for the role since 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. He definitely deserves the gold, even only to make amends for the previous snubs. At his side are two of the busiest actors of our time, Tom Hardy as the baddie (or is he?), and Domhnall Gleeson as the captain of the expedition. Both of them did a great job, but especially Hardy with his hypnotizing, rough way of speaking and his complex personality which makes him a very hard character to define. All considered, this movie is well deserving of his Best Picture nod and the probable winner.May not be as stellar as 'Birdman', but it's a very close second. 9/10",8,0,3,21 January 2016
Dunkirk," A disappointing example of bad pacing
","I would never had thought that Christopher Nolan, the man that created some of my most beloved films as a young cinema goer, would film such an unusually bad paced film and I'm starting to think that all the fuzz about it comes from the natural instinct of patriotism it evokes rather than actual technical prowess. Sure, the film is beautifully shot, but it's a shallow beauty. There are so many films that show the horror of war and coming to face one's own mortality to the point of giving anything to 'go back home': 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Full Metal Jacket' come to mind. Both films are wisely divided into tense and relaxing scenes, so that the tension is shared by the public when it comes on screen. In 'Dunkirk', the whole movie is a tension scene, which completely cancels any reason to feel tension after the first few dangerous situations our heroes find themselves in. And let's talk about these 'heroes'. It rarely happened to me to find a movie so crowded with useless talent: none of the characters mean anything to the overall story, they are sketches of the valiant, the mean, the wise, etc. and we have no time whatsoever to indulge in more intimate moments with them. This was definitely a conscious decision by Nolan, so that he could convey the feeling of telling the story of all 400.000 men and not only Harry Styles's, but if I don't feel anything for the few we actually get to know, then all 400.000 are misrepresented. Not to mention the only relevant death (which I won't spoil): it clearly just happens for some emotive involvement between such arid scenes, but it looks so artificial, so useless and stupid that it really makes you chuckle. One of the worst aspects of the film is the music, by Hans Zimmer. I would say by previous Hans Zimmer tunes, considering how any part of this score could have come from 'The Dark Knight' or 'Inception' and no-one would've noticed. Apart from its repetitiveness from other films, it's repetitive in itself: just like the endless action and danger, Zimmer's music is always tense, always on a high-alert tone, resulting in pure nothingness. Last, the week/day/hour narrative device. Nolan clearly needed something original to tell such an ultimately dull story so he and his team conceived this utterly useless idea. Throughout the film there is not a single time I thought 'Wow, now I see why he organized the story this way!' and that is because it serves no purpose other than to give the feeling of an edgy, nolanesque feature. For reference, consider 'Memento', Nolan's debut; there the complex narrative pattern makes complete sense and is functional -nay, essential- to the end result of the story. In 'Dunkirk' this temporal distortion is completely useless: the film could've followed a more regular pattern without suffering anything on the narrative side. I consider this the worst film Nolan has ever made, and I feel very disappointed knowing his potential.",9,5,8,31 August 2017
It Follows," She has no idea...
","Is it too early to say there is a renaissance of horror movies going on? One thing is for sure: in the last few years we've experienced more than a few smart, well-made spookies coming from the US. And it's such a big relief to see that, apparently, the sh*t-show of endless jump-scares seems to be kind of over. So, alongside the fairly good 'The Conjuring' and the fairly great 'The Babadook', we can now add to the list of good American contemporary horror 'It Follows': as the previous two, in fact, it shows what a good script, creative directing and pretty solid performances can do to the genre. Starting from the script, it has a beautiful simplicity to it: there's a non specified entity that follows the cursed and if 'it' gets to them, it kills them; only way to get out of it is to pass the curse on to someone else through sexual intercourse. Alongside this thin but solid premise, Mitchell showcases simple, credible dialog and well-rounded characters. The chosen stage for the story is the declined city of Detroit: another spectral aspect that perfectly fits with the ghostly presence of the title. Sure, the group of teens that form the core characters of the movie are nothing short of the classic stereotyped nerds, jocks and so on, but they are enriched with a sort of ambiguity and uncertainty in their actions that's almost never seen in this genre. It's also noticeable how Mitchell leaves some important moments in the narrative out of the viewer's reach, with underlying meanings. It is not easy to work as an artist and not as an exploiter of mindless teenagers looking for a thrill in the horror industry, but Mitchell and his team worked out an unflinching film, that doesn't care to be too innovative, and yet modernizes classic '80s style creeps. It (see what I did there?) may not appeal to more gore or shock oriented moviegoers, but it's their loss. And it is because 'It Follows' is the smartest horror in years.8/10",7,1,1,7 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A thoughtful and gorgeous addition to the Star Wars epic
","Finally, after two long years, the third trilogy continues in 'The Last Jedi' by Rian Johnson. From a writer/director of this calibre I could only expect the most mature Star Wars ever, and I was not disappointed on this end: in this film we finally see some doubt in the sharp distinction between good and evil, a more interesting dinamic between the baddies and the good guys. Rey doubts master Luke, Luke himself hides some shadows in his past that he would like to bury forever, Finn and the newly introduced Rose team up with a guy whose lesson is 'Good and Evil are the same: it's just business'. One could see this as a common carefree character, but in reality he channels an interesting point made throughout the film: good and evil may not be as different as they seem. Maybe. Because eventually the good guys (kind of) win, and Kylo stays true to his baddie persona, if with some very interesting twists coming along. To this regard, Rian Johnson seems to be playing with fan fictions here, proving all of them wrong even if the solution he finds is not quite as satisfying sometimes. Is it really a good idea to make Rey's parents some nobodies? What about all the threads scattered around in Episode VII that we got crazy to understand? Can it really be the best choice to let it all die this way? Sure, Kylo said that, Rey believes that, but nothing forbids for Ep. IX to change everything on this end. Luke's death is pretty good, although maybe not that necessary. Same goes for Snoke's fate: he was never anything more than a nobody himself? An all-powerful being without any connection to the past of the Sith order? Seems very cheap if you ask me.If this SW really did something better than all his predecessors, it is to show us what the 'Wars' in the title mean: there are so many combat scenes, but they are unusually complex, with great military strategy behind every move and with incredible visual effect on the spectators. I really loved how some things require some time to be understood: for example, Yoda laughing at Luke's willingness to destroy the tree containing the Books of the Jedi and telling him that Rey already has what she needs to become a Jedi is a great piece of writing, because everything gets a simple, clear explanation later on: she had already taken the books away, with her.The Last Jedi follows the trend started with Episode VII and continued with Rogue One last year: it's not as groundbreaking as the originals, but it carefully works both with the source material and with new ideas, crafting a very good new entry. The best part are its insightful ideas about shading the line between good and evil; the worst are some writing choices (like Snoke's and Phasma's deaths, two interesting and completely underdeveloped characters).",8,5,18,15 December 2017
La La Land," Blending classic and modern musical is possible
","'La La Land' is nominated for a record-tying 14 categories (obviously including Best Picture) at the 2017 Oscars and it would definitely deserve the win if so. Damien Chazelle is an incredibly talented young director, with both his feature films nominated and both being the greatest achievements in musical films of the 2010s.'La La Land' is both a love statement to the classic Hollywood musicals and a bold new direction for the genre, that never looked more done for if not for Chazelle. Sebastian and Mia both have dreams of glory and both of them are talented artists: she's a wannabe actress and he's a wannabe jazz player. For two thirds of the movie we're fooled into thinking that nothing will divert from the canon except (more or less) the setting. But little by little an attentive observer notices how intelligent the plot structure really is: the ending feels extremely sour on one hand, and yet happy on the other, which is perfectly represented with those last, beautiful smiles. Some may not like it, but a story like this manages to cover both the dreamlike state of musical characters and the new, more grounded conscience of modern filmmakers, that never touched the musical romance before.'LLL' has a lot in common with 'Whiplash' under a directorial point of view, and yet it manages to stand on its own quite well. They share a love for grand-angular shots and bold camera movements, but LLL stands out with its incredible long takes coordinated with the musical pieces. On that account, LLL stands out once more. Its all-original musics feel modern and classic at the same time and they are sided with fantastic dance choreographies (although sometimes the leads don't seem to dance perfectly, they're still actors, not professional dancers). Chazelle plays to the limit with chromatic effects throughout the movie: the colors on the scene are generally extremely bright and his use of the lens generates strange optic effects of dots of light on the side of some frames.Stone and Gosling's performances are a true tour de force: they act brilliantly, sing lovingly and dance like they worked in Broadway all year long. As I said, the dance sections are not without imperfections, but to think what these two went through to accomplish this is simply amazing. Stone's performance is particularly noteworthy as she acts like she can't act very well, but not even that badly during her auditions, which is something any actor would want to do that well. Gosling unexpectedly shines more in the musical pieces, solidifying himself as a multifaceted talent.'La La Land' is definitely one of the Movies of the Year 2016 as it renews a dying genre with vigor, talent and new spirit.",9,4,11,17 February 2017
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's last gift to cinema lovers
","Stanley Kubrick died four days after showing Warner Bros. the alleged final cut of 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Those close to him claim that he considered it his best work ever, like many great authors do in their old age. I can certainly see why Kubrick thought so (if he actually did): EWS is the absolute, perfect representation of his kind of approach to cinema. Disoriented characters, an eerie duality, in this specific case between the world of daylight and that of nighttime, broken pieces of dialogues, loss of control over one's own purposes. In one sentence, Bill is THE Kubrickian character. The story itself, another adaptation from a novel, is hauntingly mysterious, with its apparently random encounters of strange characters, from the menacing unnamed follower to the sketchy owner of the 'Rainbow' shop. The night wanderings by Bill reminded me of a simple, yet smart film by Martin Scorsese, 'After Hours', which could be an inspiration for some of it. Another engaging aspect are the many inner links between different scenes that eventually add up to nothing but give a weird sense of connection and of a bigger scheme behind Bill's actions: the one that struck me most was the 'Place under the rainbow' reference made by the two models at the party, which connects to a locale under the 'Rainbow' shop where Bill buys his costume. As in most his films, Kubrick has a taste for the esoteric, hinting at many things without explaining anything clearly, which is to me his most interesting style feature. Ironically, I think that in this film Kubrick was so explicit while attempting to show us his own way of cinema that it loses some of the wonder the viewer has in his most ingenious works, first of all '2001', where the idea behind the film is so hidden and unclear that to understand it makes for one of the greatest experiences cinema can offer.Kubrick's style choices for this picture are more similar to those made in 'Barry Lyndon' than it may seem, for two reasons. Most scenes are shot with the impression of using only 'natural' light, meaning there is no stage illumination but only lamps, Christmas lights and so on. Christmas trees are everywhere and their multicolored lights take us back to the 'rainbow' theme, meaning the bright side of the world, under which lies the darkness of raw desire (see the models...). Secondly, Tom Cruise is used more like a mask himself than an actual man: his expressions are recurring and almost unnatural, as he tries to find his way in the labyrinth of his perceptions. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were married at the time of shooting, which reinforces the fact that Kubrick loved the interaction between reality and fiction. If in 'A Clockwork Orange' the viewer actually goes through the Ludwig cure, here he has the opportunity of seeing unveil a crisis in a couple played by one of the most famous couples of the time. While I loved Cruise's acting, Kidman's felt a little too obvious and extreme, although I don't know how much of a fault she has in it, as Kubrick always had total control over his works.",9,1,2,23 January 2017
Sicario," A masterclass in acting (Del Toro) and directing (Villeneuve)
","2015 was a very good year in films, and 'Sicario' can be considered one of its highlights, but not one of the very best. First off, for me this movie was a great way to get to know for the first time two big names and talents in the industry: lead actor Benicio Del Toro and director Denis Villeneuve. The former did an outstanding job -maybe Oscar worthy, totally nomination worthy- at portraying a cold and expert man (I won't get into detail not to spoil anything), the latter made great use of the south-US/Mexico landscapes, but also of the focus on small details, to give a proper identity to the film, which eventually looks slick and classy while also portraying horrifying images (i.e. the amazing first scene). I also liked Josh Brolin's take as an eccentric, no-nonsense DoD consultant, though his character tended to turn darker and darker for no apparent reason. Probably (hopefully) he's gonna have a big role in the sequel. Jóhann Jóhannsson keeps up the good work with a simple, yet fitting soundtrack: he reminds me more and more of the mastermind, Hans Zimmer, in that sense. But let's get to the nay part. Before watching 'Sicario' I'd heard that Emily Blunt's performance was the one to look after. It isn't. She really tries, and she does so hard she gets irritating. She's always swearing, crying, being disappointed, and all that in a desperate way, as if she needed to show us she's the lead actress in a boys' flick. Her partner does the same, or even worse. Finally, some words on the complicated plot. At the end of the story, everything fits well, and you won't be disappointed, but in the making it feels at times disorienting and excessively cryptic.A very good movie, an outstanding work by cast and crew, with one major disappointment. 8/10",8,3,5,23 January 2016
Arrival," Interesting, but too reminiscent of other recent sci-fi's
","'Arrival' begins as countless sci-fi stories begin: a few alien space-ships land (or, in this case 'float') on Earth and people freak out to understand their intentions. In 'Indipendence Day' their intentions were bad; in 'District 9' the aliens become the victims. Here a simple story as this one evolves into something I could call Nietzschean, not to spoil with specifics to future viewers, growing into something I was not prepared for at the beginning. But at the same time this clever story shows some inevitable similarities to other hit sci-fi's of the past few years, first of all 'Interstellar' by Christopher Nolan. While the first 3/4s of the film work magnificently, the ending feels more like a b-movie finale, with its race against time and predictable solution, although the final speech may bring less philosophically learned audiences food for the mind. It is not clear what the final encounter with the aliens means, though, and I fear that the scene was written that way to justify a sequel in a few years, but maybe it's just me.Denis Villeneuve's 'Sicario' was a 2015 hit movie first of all because of its brilliant visual style. 'Arrival' is no less so, with more beautiful landscapes and ingenious shots, especially inside the aliens' den. Johann Johannsson is also back for the score, which is true to his minimal style and really manages to enhance the power of some of the best scenes in the central part of the film; I actually didn't really like the use of the very well-known 'On the Nature of Daylight' at the beginning and end of the movie though, as it feels like a cheap move to trigger an emotional response on the audience with such easy means. The simple design of the aliens and their space-ships is a true winner, being simultaneously mysterious, ominous and intriguing; the language used by the creatures is the greatest value of the whole movie, a true stroke of genius both in its design and in its broader meaning.It seems like Amy Adams's star has no intention to burn out, as we saw the actress star in two well-praised 2016 movies: 'Arrival' and 'Nocturnal Animals' by Tom Ford. While I personally don't like her too much, I must admit she's a true force of nature when it comes to explore emotional acting: in both films her characters undergo intense moments and she acts them out surehandedly and with a magnetic touch, helped by the two visual-heavy directors, who love to linger a lot on her face. Renner's Ian Donnelly is a funny guy, a lot similar in his behavior to the more famous role of his, Hawkeye. As a whole he doesn't do too much, but may be better this way. Whitaker is a great actor and, although his role is not the biggest ever, he stands well between the other mains.",8,0,7,19 January 2017
The Conjuring," An old school horror that frightens without cheap thrills
","'The Conjuring' is a 2013 horror movie by James Wan. It features what is claimed to be the true story of a family haunted by a demonic entity in their new house in Rhode Island. Their story merges with that of two famous ghost-hunters who take to heart their situation. Although a ghost story is maybe the most overused narrative trigger for a horror movie, Wan manages to direct a film where the usual thrill providers (doors squeaking, childish voices whispering, hand out of nowhere and everything else) are used in a stylish and well paced way, thus incredibly managing to feel as fresh as the first time you've experienced it. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson do a great job as the explorers of the supernatural, delivering some heartfelt performances. The feel of the movie is very classic: it's clear that the director tried his best to make the audience feel like watching an old-style horror flick, and that mostly works, with explicit references to 'The Exorcist', haunted house movies in general, and even 'The Birds' by Hitchcock. I also enjoyed the duality of the story, taking its time introducing a seemingly unrelated side-horror tale about an extremely creepy doll, Annabelle, whom apparently people keep in their houses although it gives chills just by looking at her. Anyway, 'The Conjuring' is a rare well-crafted horror movie in these years, so it deserves a round of applause for trying to keep the genre from collapsing. I'm still bedazzled by the fact that this movie and the god-awful 'Dead Silence' share the same director: an example of how important is the screen writing in a movie, especially a mystery one like this one.",7,0,0,26 June 2016
Halloween," I blame this film for stupid horror films
","Wow, great start: the long shot and the plot twist. But then it's this scene repeating for an hour and a half: - an apparently normal situation - Meyers suddenly appears (tense music) - characters feel something wrong - Meyers has disappeared! - characters say 'oh, silly me' - deadNot to mention how incredibly stupid the protagonist is, how predictable are the killer's comebacks, how awful is the acting and so on. The bright sides are cinematography and directing, but all the rest is bullshit, even for a self-produced film. How dare people say this is the best slasher when 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', a truly clever and terrifying modern horror, exists and existed 4 years before this, beats me. That is the father of the slasher genre and this one is the beginning of its end.",9,2,4,27 February 2017
Paths of Glory," An anti-war masterpiece
","'Paths of Glory' is the film that officially transformed Kubrick from a talented young director to a genius in the eyes of the public. Although I consider 'The Killing' an already stellar film, I see why this one would get so much love: its anti-war themes are splendidly developed in Kubrick's unforgiving way, giving the viewer every reason to keep his hopes high, but regularly smashing them in his face, showing how the world actually works and not how the classic movies would like to make us believe. The character of Dax (a performance that Kirk Douglas grows into as the movie progresses) seems to be the only reasonable person in a maddened system where human lives matter less than the career of the powerful. The natural instinct of survival (showed by the sentenced soldiers as they approach the end) is labelled as 'cowardice' and reprimanded by those who are not in danger, of course. But the scene that may have moved me the most is the ending, with the French soldiers first taunting the German girl but then getting emotional as they realize that they share the human nature, and all the mad orders they follow have no meaning at all.",9,2,4,16 January 2017
Black Panther," The best MCU movie to date
","I would never have expected for 'Black Panther', out of all superheroes, to be so engaging and thought-provoking as this film was. Ryan Coogler is known for being a smart director, but here he completely breaks the usual scheme of simple, one-dimensional characters siding for good against evil and creates some of the most unique heroes ever made for the cinema screen. Killmonger, a barely known villain, is elevated to a complex personality, filled with rage and vengeance, and it's not unreasonable to actually understand his points. After all, he does nothing legally wrong, but he's overthrown for a supposed greater good. Now, this is what a great protagonist-antagonist interaction is about. 
Every actor gives their best, especially the lead, Boseman: the accent invented for Wakandans is so unique, and he manages to play beautifully with words through it.On the cons notes, there still are a couple, which doesn't let 'Black Panther' enter the masterpiece zone: 
1) The gags are forced, a problem many MCU movies share. Producers should understand that laughter is not a necessity all the time, and there can be a Marvel movie where the public just doesn't laugh. The result in a movie like this one is a huge cringe-effect when jokes are evidently juxtaposed for such goal. There are a couple decent ones, but they are exceptions.
2) The other problem virtually all Marvel movies share, the inevitable bombastic, over-predictable final fight. In particular, I found the CIA operative an uninspired addition to the cast in this section, as well as the sudden atonement of W'Kabi.",8,1,5,26 April 2018
Godzilla," Great Godzilla action, but little soul
","This is the quintessential American blockbuster, for better and for worse. It sports amazing visuals and CG, but it really lacks on character development and psychology. While I sort of enjoyed the unexpectedly logical choices by the military (who, shockingly, aren't evil and don't confuse friends for foes), I was bummed by the titular monster's little screen time, which relegates him to an awesome secondary character. Overall, not stellar but a decent reboot for the franchise.",7,0,2,11 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The one movie that changed it all
","Oh, boy. Reviewing a film that so many critics have been writing about is so hard, but also deserves a try for sure. The original Star Wars is not that kind of movie you love because it's so well made or so complex and deep; you love it because it makes you happy. George Lucas back in the day didn't want to create the perfect sci-fi movie (he says so in a Rolling Stones review), as that was '2001: A Space Odyssey' in his opinion; he wanted to make something special in its lightness, a space opera not focusing on space (as did its future rival, Star Trek), but on a very, very simple story of a rescue (and later on in the saga, a family). Each character is just perfect in his role: Luke, the hero, with his strong sense of duty; Han Solo, the roughneck, a guy whose role in the universe is not yet written but soon will be; Princess Leia, a role model for girls at a time when a woman leading a group of adventurers was just fantasy. And this is just the main squad. I won't dwell on the amazing comedic commentary by the two droids (one of which, without a single word, became the favorite character of many fans!), the ominous figure of the mysterious Darth Vader and the mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, with the delicate role of introducing us to the mystical side of this world, the Force. No movie is perfect for me, and in this case I'll have to state the one, unimportant flaw in the whole original trilogy: the acting in itself isn't great and some points of the plot are off. That said, the chemistry between the actors is palpable and the story is so funny, you don't need to stress every aspect of it.When every single scene in a movie is canon, you know you're watching a masterpiece. 9/10",9,1,1,23 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best sequels in the history of cinema
","The incredible, universal success of 'Star Wars' in 1977 was a big incentive for George Lucas and his squad to deliver a sequel that could cover them in money just like the first did and that could satisfy fans and critics. The final result was (and is) a fantastic movie, arguably the best sequel ever in this kind of cinematic experience. As Lucas left the writing job to his fellow storyteller Lawrence Kasdan (very possibly the real mastermind behind the most amusing lines, considering the awful job Lucas did all alone with the prequels), the adventure is just as iconic as 'A New Hope', but with a darker and somewhat more mature mood, as the title suggests. If 'Star Wars' was an epic poem, and in some ways it is, this film should be considered its 'discentio ad inferos', that is the lowest moment for the hero, who then rises from its ashes and manages to win once and for all ('Return of the Jedi'): both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker find themselves in great danger at the hands of Darth Vader, a character that immediately grows in depth after one of the last scenes, which is also one of the most famous scenes (and worst quoted lines) in the history of cinema and possibly the best idea to come from George Lucas's mind. One possible mistake could have been to recycle our beloved characters in cheap fashion, but instead everyone of them grows and gets more defined through the story and we are introduced to yet some other iconic members of this wonderful universe, like Master Yoda, Lando Calrissian and the baddest bounty hunter ever, Boba Fett. On top of all that, John Williams's music is just as fantastic as the first time around, modelling itself to the more grim atmosphere.Is Episode V better than Episode IV? Not for me, but it's the other masterpiece in the saga. 9/10",9,1,2,24 January 2016
