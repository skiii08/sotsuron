Casablanca," Everything That Makes a True Classic is Here
","To have lasting appeal in the past, present, and future, that defines a classic. As for my humble opinion, I believe there are two things which enable a filmmaker to create a classic that people hold dear: identifiable elements that are not so far-fetched from our own world and a profound message that continues to inspire and strengthen us with age. Bearing this in mind, it's understandable why the acclaimed Casablanca is a beloved work of cinema and counted among the great classic films. A romantic, patriotic, and idealistic movie that continues to stand the test of time and enchant present generations. Derived from an unpublished play that surprisingly went nowhere, Casablanca is as beautifully photographed as it is narrated. The central focus is a timeless relationship between two characters played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, without whom there's no doubt the movie wouldn't be as memorable or appealing. A loving relationship between Rick Blaine (Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Bergman) in Paris tragically ends because of the outbreak of the War and leaves Rick a heartbroken and apathetic man. It drives him into hiding away from the world's problems in his café in far off Casablanca. But the fires of a lost passion are rekindled upon Ilsa's unanticipated reentry into his life, their fates forever entwined. Ilsa explains to Rick that something greater than the both of them had begun to unfold in her relationship with Victor Laszlo, the hero of the Resistance. She appeals to the sentimental heart and the patriotic spirit that rests within Rick's cynical exterior. His former self revived, Rick grants his lover and her husband passage to America in one of cinema's most memorable finales, as they say farewell outside of a plane, all for the sake of the cause they fight for. The rest is cinematic history! I find it hard to believe that no one expected anything grand to come from Casablanca during the course of its development. The film is handled with great care, having a strong script and outstanding performances. Humphrey Bogart brilliantly portrays a hero, ranging from a broken man with little to lose to a redeemed figure who is changed for the better in the end. As Ilsa, Ingrid Bergman conveys a very warm and tender nature. And of course, the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is top-notch and deeply moving. Countless are all the classic moments and dialogue that even those who have never seen the movie can recognize. One of my favorite scenes takes place during the second meeting between Rick and Ilsa. Upon entering the café, Ilsa seems bathed by an almost heavenly light, symbolic of Rick's salvation. Another sequence that lingers within me is when the crowd singing La Marseillaise drowns the Nazi anthem out. Both scenes illustrate the crux themes of the movie, of how much hope a loving relationship can provide and how justice will prevail over evil if we all stand united. Casablanca is not a movie that's to be marveled for technological achievements, but something infinitely more meaningful. For the leading characters, their relationship meant hope, which was exactly what was needed throughout the bleak time that was World War II. Casablanca is a movie that encourages viewers to follow their hearts and to take a stand for the many. No matter how insignificant you may seem, making a difference is never impossible. Those who have thought that Casablanca would never go far, let alone be hailed as a timeless classic, could not have been more wrong. I expect I'll be asking Sam to play it again soon!",Null,3,5,3 December 2012
Citizen Kane," Greatest Movie Ever Made? Debatable. Deserves to be Recognized? Absolutely!
","Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is reputed to be the greatest movie of all time. Roger Ebert calls it his number one favorite and it is believed to have revolutionized the world of cinema, as it was known during its time. That sort of compliment carries more weight and depth than many realize. While I would not go so far as to call Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made, it cannot be denied that it is a work of extreme ambition which defied conventional standards and deserves to be recognized and respected for its brilliance. It's my belief that few understand the courage that was needed to stand against up William Randolph Hearst, a very influential figure in American media and politics, whose ambition, like Orson Welles, knew no bounds. After learning about the unflattering portrayal of him in first feature film of the 24-year-old Welles, Hearst went out of his way to ensure that the production never saw the light of day. To my great relief, he did not succeed. The great potential of Welles became known during his time at the Mercury Theater. Although he was a newcomer to the film industry, he was granted total control of his signature work and had many of his theatrical colleagues to assist him. Even a novice at filmmaking sorely lacking in experience can go far with a good editor and director of photography. Welles took all the credit, but it's more than likely that without the luxury of cinematographer Gregg Toland and young editor Robert Wise, Citizen Kane would not be as praised as it is today. A portrait of William Randolph Hearst's life, Citizen Kane follows the events of Charles Foster Kane's death. Reporter Jerry Thompson is tasked with uncovering the meaning of Kane's dying word 'Rosebud'. Was Kane a good man, an egotistical tyrant, or a sympathetic tragic figure? Thompson interviews everyone who was close to Kane, providing the audience the opportunity to examine the titular character through their perspectives. Deprived of a normal childhood, Kane attended and failed in a number of schools before gaining control of the sensational newspaper The New York Inquirer and eventually entering politics. A man of noble intentions, he degraded into a megalomaniac over time, leaving him empty and alone in the end. The meaning of 'Rosebud' remains a mystery to the characters in the movie but not to the audience, as a sled from his youth, the only time when Kane was ever truly happy, is burned with the rest of his forgotten treasures. Citizen Kane can be considered a textbook of cinematic techniques. Even if you are not impressed by the collection of memorable and well developed characters or the means by which the story is told, from a technical standpoint the film is groundbreaking, with atmospheric and environmental effects used to convey the plot and the brilliant use of cinematography to capture all the emotion and mystery through the use of varied angles and darkness. All in all, simply impossible not to appreciate!How unfortunate it is that Citizen Kane received a negative critical reception upon its release and failed to win all but one Oscar (Best Writing, Original Screenplay) out of its nine nominations. Orson Welles was a born artist who lost everything as Kane did and spent the rest of his life trying to live up to the promise shown in his magnum opus. His career declined, but his legacy will forever stand as a testament to one man's creative vision and the steps he was willing to take to fight for his dreams. There are those who claim that Citizen Kane is overrated. Is that so? Perhaps. But regardless, there is much to be admired for avid filmmakers and anyone else who enjoys a thought-provoking narrative experience. One thing I can say with certainty is that the efforts of Orson Welles were not in vain.",Null,1,2,26 November 2012
Sinister," Testifies that graphic violence is unnecessary to make a frightening ghost story.
","When it comes to the underside of modern cinema, the horror genre frequently falls victim, plagued by uninspired remakes and tiresome clichés. For some time it's been apparent that fresh original ideas are not easy to come by and I'm among the many that misses being scared. I attended a theatrical showing of Sinister with soaring expectations, prepared to be frightened once again, and left almost two hours later more satisfied than I've been in a long time. This supernatural movie is easily the most impressive of it's kind in recent years. Exorcism of Emily Rose director Scott Derrickson has demonstrated an effective ability to convey horror and understands how powerful atmosphere and suspense can be. Let's hope that he'll continue to give us more.True crime novelist Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) sees great potential for his accomplishment of a lifetime in an unsolved murder that has taken place in the house that he and his family have moved into. His only lead, a mysterious box of Super 8 footage of the murder that has taken place in his new home as well as several other cases of unsolved family murders abroad, found in the attic. Oswalt's findings deduce two aspects that make a connection with each murder. A disappearance of one child in each family and a demonic apparition that appears somewhere in each film. The malevolent phenomenon of the movie is the Pagan deity Buhguul, who subsists on the souls of vulnerable children and resides in a netherworld to which images serve as a gateway for him. Even though Buhguul is silent and makes brief appearances, his presence is felt and feared throughout the movie and he is sure to find his way into your nightmares for a long while to come. The possibility of solving the mystery is opened thanks to the advantage of modernized technology. As the investigation unfolds, eerily evocative happenings begin happening to Oswalt's family. Against forces beyond his comprehension, Oswalt becomes torn between his goal of uncovering the truth and the well being of his loved ones. Ethan Hawke is very believable in portraying his role. You feel his determination to uncover the truth and how much his job means to him. As he becomes more detached from his family so do we as an audience. He emphasizes a potential that I hope won't remain obscured. Palpable tension builds as the climax draws ever closer and the intensity is amplified by haunting visuals and Christopher Young's spine-chilling soundtrack. The blend of Super 8 footage with traditional cinematography gives Sinister a gritty down-to-earth feel, taking the viewers along for the experience. I've long grown accustomed to foreseeing and identifying film clichés and predictable outcomes, especially in the horror genre, but to my great surprise I found myself frightened on both a conscious and subconscious level. Graphic violence and explicit bloodshed are not needed to make a ghost story scary and Sinister deserves to be admired in this respect. What greater horror can exist than the evil that defies our comprehension? To all my fellow avid fans of the horror genre that have thought about giving Sinister a watch, surrender to your temptation because a refreshing treat awaits you!",Null,1,3,19 November 2012
Les Misérables," Surely the best cinematic adaptation of one of literature and theater's great classics.
","There's no need to vouch for the musical that swept the world. Few are as celebrated as Les Miserables, and for all the right reasons. The musical production was truly beyond compare. Its songs; powerful, its acting; stellar, the storytelling; wondrous; and its impact; everlasting. It's long earned its place as my favorite. To develop a work of cinema out of this phenomenon would be a great challenge requiring respectful care, but would not be an impossible matter. This much is established by Tom Hooper's most recent addition to his growing body of ambitious work, an entertaining film adaptation that faithfully emphasized the themes that countless viewers, myself among them, fell in love with. The movie follows the same path as the musical, starting with Jean Valjean's release from 19 years of slavery on a charge of stealing bread to feed his starving family and his failed attempts at escape. A Bishop who shows him compassion and the path to salvation sparks Valjean's journey to redemption. Henceforth dedicated to upholding his bargain with God, Valjean assumes a new identity and a new life, breaking his parole to fulfill his mission to show the world the goodness that he has found within himself. Years pass and by that time Valjean has become a respected factory owner and the mayor of a town that prospered under his reign. An intervention of fate leads Valjean to a new task that would change his life once again. Fantine, a desperate woman symbolic of the miserable life of poverty in France was betrayed and deserted by her lover. Left alone with Cosette, the child she bore out of wedlock, she commits herself entirely to her daughters welfare, going as far as to sell her own body for the coin she needs to ensure her daughter's survival. As Fantine lies dying from an illness, Valjean learns that he had a part in her downfall. Fantine had been a worker in his factory who Valjean fired at the request of his lecherous foreman after she rejected his advances. Overcome by guilt and wishing to make amends he now makes another promise of a lifetime – to become the father Cosette never knew and raise her as his own. Valjean finds Cosette and what then begins is something greater than he could ever imagine being possible; he experiences love for the first time, a sequence illuminated in a beautiful song; one of the original touches this movie delivers which has rightfully earned its academy award nomination. Made possible by Victor Hugo's novel, Les Miserables is a timeless story filled with timeless characters and enriched by timeless themes. The essential pillars which hold the structure upright are the complex forces that come into play. Throughout the course of the story, Valjean is hunted by his obsessive enemy Inspector Javert; a man obligated by his duty to the law who shows no remorse for those he perceives as unjust. Since he does this sincerely in the name of God, he and Valjean prove to be two sides of the same coin. Javert isn't evil, but his own unbending sense of Justice renders him blind to the forces that can lead weaker men astray. This and his complete lack of compassion for those he considers sinners ultimately lead to his tragic downfall when he realizes that Valjean is a better man than he. The Thénardier couple, an innkeeper and his wife, who kept Cosette in a dismal life of servitude light the tone of the story with comedic appeal. All of these events unfold in the midst of a revolution of youths rising up against an oppressive government, under the leadership of the dashing and charismatic Enjolras and Marius Pontmercy (who would later develop a loving relationship with Cosette). Within this turmoil, all the characters find themselves bound. Fresh from the success of The King's Speech and the John Adams mini series, Tom Hooper gave the world of Les Miserables a gritty and down-to-earth atmosphere and took the unusual step of recording the songs during the filming rather than dubbing the voices in later. This is where the movie has fallen flat for those expecting top-notch vocal performances. More focus is thus placed on the acting as opposed to singing and it doesn't seem fair to compare the actors to their musical theater counterparts. There are enough positive elements to overwhelm the negatives, including the Oscar nominated performances of Hugh Jackman (who is no stranger to the musical world and as a result is absolutely wonderful portraying Jean Valjean) and Anne Hathaway, who despite having much less screen time, delivers a stunning performance as Fantine. Her scene involving the famous song 'I Dreamed a Dream' shows how far she has come since Princess Diaries, a powerful blend of song and emotional acting. The production value reflects the tone that was intended and enables the viewers to immerse themselves in the world of strife and struggle; to savor all the passion. The most important aspect is conveying all the emotions and all the themes for which Les Miserables the classic novel and classic musical is rightfully renowned for – liberty, love, redemption, and the triumph of the human spirit even when the battle is lost. I admire all movies that take risks, those that take a path that conformist filmmakers dare not tread. Tom Hooper's Les Miserables is a work of exceptional fidelity that is surely the best cinematic adaptation of one of literature and theater's great classics. The cinematic experience is one that won't soon diminish for me and frankly I hope it never will!",Null,1,3,22 January 2013
