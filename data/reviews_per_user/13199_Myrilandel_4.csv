The Ring," Good, but...
","I just recently went to the theater to see 'The Ring'.  While I can't really say that I was disappointed, I just can't understand why everyone thought this movie was so terrifying.  True, it did have its moments, and there are a couple of images in it that I don't think I'll ever get out of my head, but this film struck me as more of a dark mystery than true horror.  I even got a little bored in the middle as the main characters struggled to develop the plot, which was creepy, but not so much that I couldn't sleep at night. If you have nothing else to do and feel like watching a movie that actually makes you think, then you'll enjoy 'The Ring'.  I give it 3 out of 4 stars for a great plot and some really scary images.",Null,0,0,24 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Well...
","I absolutely adored FOTR, even with my impossibly high standards due to my reading the entire series twice.  Jackson not only was faithful to the plot but also created a movie that was enjoyable on its own.  Then, the sequel came to theaters.  After hearing many rumors of how the plot was going to be altered, I admit, I was apprehensive as I sat down in front of that large screen.  My fears were soon justified. Yes, the visuals were stunning.  Yes, the CGI was beyond anything I could have imagined.  Still, the character development was noticeably lacking. Legolas got a little more screen time than in the first movie, but nothing significant, and poor Gimli was reduced to comic relief. Then, Jackson made really unnecessary additions to the plot.  Between Aragorn's repeated fantasies about Arwen, and the incident where he almost perished after falling from a cliff, not to mention the kidnapping of Sam and Frodo by Faramir, who was supposed to be wiser than his late brother, I was wondering if the book had been so boring that they had to create an entirely new plot. There were also numerous plot holes.  Why were Merry and Pippin brought before the newly-revived Gandalf, and then in the next scene it was like it never happened?  Even with elvish abilities, why did it take such a short time for the Lothlorien elves to arrive at Helm's Deep?  For that matter, why were they there in the first place? I realize that artistic license must be taken to bring any book to the big screen, but the unnecessary changes only served to hurt the movie as a movie, book aside.  I'm hoping that the final film of the trilogy will return to the original plot and give the characters the depth they deserve.",9,0,0,11 January 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Satisfying Treat in a Lovely, Shiny Wrapper
","First off, I would really like to emphasize that this movie is *not* a remake of the 1970's film. That's like saying Peter Jackson remade Ralph Bakshi's 1970's version of LOTR. It's instead a new, darker, and more cynical look at Roald Dahl's novel. Dahl's work is infamous for being darker than your average kiddy fare, so in that sense, Burton *was* being faithful to the source material. Beyond that, I honestly don't care how faithfully Burton recreated the original book because what I saw on the screen was captivating, satisfying, and definitely enjoyable. The opening sequence, complemented perfectly by Elfman's quirky soundtrack, had me eager for the rest of the film. The acting was great, including Depp's quirky and original take on Wonka and Highmore's heartbreakingly pure Charlie. I loved the overall look of the film, including the beautifully bright and colorful, yet still sterile, semi-dark, and slightly off-kilter, factory. One major change that Burton made, which seems to be a point of contention for some, is the inclusion of a back story for Wonka which brings in Christopher Lee in a delightful cameo. While the flashbacks themselves could run a little long and make the action of the movie stutter a bit, I liked the overall story and how it influenced the eventual ending, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The only complaint I really have is the lack of dialogue on the part of the children while they're in the factory. There were a few nice bits of memorable banter, but I left wishing they had had more screen time. This is especially true for Veruca, who was nowhere near whiny or demanding enough for my taste. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but wished there had been a little more to it. Still, I understand that it's difficult to pack so very much into a short span of time. While it may not be the richest treat, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a solid and delicious, if a bit small, piece of dark chocolate in a shiny and eye-catching wrapper.",8,19,33,23 July 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Whoo hoo! Best movie ever
","Ever since I've started seeing previews for this movie, I've been excited. Could it possibly be? Classic Simpsons humor brought to the big screen without mangling the characters that have become so real and interesting over the years? Well, I'm happy to say that this movie delivered, and then some. Hearty laughs were interspersed with genuine heartfelt moments (seriously, I got teary-eyed at one point), and the magic of the early seasons of the show was captured flawlessly. Homer wasn't just a food-monster with a few one-liners every so often, and all the other characters had similar depth. All this was achieved within a mere one and a half hours.I applaud all my favorite Simpsons writers (yes, you too, Swartzwelder, much as you try to avoid the spotlight). This movie has waited decades to be made, but it was certainly worth the wait. I can't wait to see it again.",9,3,6,28 July 2007
