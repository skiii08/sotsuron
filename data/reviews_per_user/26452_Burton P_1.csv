Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Betrayed in a galaxy far far away
","All that I could say after watching this film was 'that was awful'. It was everything that I have come to despise in Disney films. It was a cutsey, sappy, plotless homage to the power of a  a bunch of mindless, unimaginative teenagers weilding Silicon Graphics workstations. Put Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers, and the Little Mermaid in a blender and the Phantom Menace will pour out. Don't forget to spin it up well, all of the plot and character development should end up splattered on the wall. This movie was made to sell toys to seven year olds. I have to say that I rank the original three movies as some of the best that I have seen and the Phantom Menace (aptly named as a menace) was a major, major let down. I was prepared to be annoyed at the computer graphics, I was prepared for some cutsey nonsense, but this was worse, far, far, worse than I ever could have possibly imagined. George you've betrayed us all and gone to the dark side.",1,3,6,26 May 1999
