The Legend of Bagger Vance," We are looking for a Bagger Vance
","This is what a movie should look like; a lot of innocence, a little mischief and just a hint of tragedy. This movie is from the era when Charlize Theron still retained some of her feminine grace and beauty. She looks absolutely stunning. However, Will Smith, as an extremely likable mysterious mentor, stole the movie. All characters are well placed with as much screen-time as it was necessary to keep the pace of the movie while holding on to the attention of the audience.The best thing about it is despite being a feel-good movie it does not have too many emotionality. Just the amount necessary for the flavour. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat but the time did not just go by but flew like a jet. Bagger Vance is someone who fills a void in all of our lives as we go through our day to day routines looking for someone to tell us whether we are doing it right? If not then how to do it right? Whatever this 'it' might be.Most American movies teach audience that one can do anything with mere belief, whereas this movie shows that even the best of the best can't do just by self-belief but one needs a proper guidance to believe. You cannot believe a lie and a proper guide shows you the truth and then you choose to believe. That's all this movie is about.All in all it is definitely feel-good movie especially when you are really feeling down. Don't judge it by your version of science of movie making but judge it for what it is as it is not pretentious. It is what it is. A great movie.",9,1,3,17 February 2010
50 First Dates," Another idea, another gutter
","It is not unusual for Hollywood to create or discover a unique idea and then throw it right into gutter by making a movie about it. Most of the time they don't base the movie on the idea instead it entirety is about the idea. In any such case the content simply seems to say, 'The creators of this movie had an idea and they happen to think that you should know about it.' And this is another example. The basic theme behind '50 First Dates' is quite unacceptable for me. Or maybe it is bad writing and Drew Barrymore's acting.After my above rant it is needless to say it was a badly written film. However, I must say I don't find Ms. Barrymore's acting abilities particularly entertaining and this was no exception. Her childish style and media craze attached to her physical properties, which was fuelled by her infamous Late Show adventure, makes her even more unattractive. Anyways this movie could not be better without Drew Barrymore, thanks to the writing.I don't know how but Adam Sandler always manages to entertain with his monotonous acting and invariable style. He was no different in here but even he could not help this failure.The idea of memory loss was not thought over thoroughly. Many of the paradoxes associated to such a condition were simply ignored. Given the human psychology and its basic instinct to stay wary of a total stranger – not to mention the psychological stress of given situations – such a scenario is impossible and help less.'50 First Dates' is not recommended if you don't want to wonder after watching it 'Is this really what I wasted a sunny afternoon for?'",5,2,4,16 April 2008
Minority Report," A Line between Science-Fiction and Spiritualism
","As a matter of fact, I do not like Tom Cruise as an actor. I have nothing against him personally; however, I don't think he is a good actor.In spite of all above, 'Minority Report' is a movie which is worth looking at. The movie, basically, deals with an important problem of ethics and philosophy, which, in itself is appreciable. The movie deals with looking into future but entirely differently from time-travel movies. It is looking into an individual's future, finding out if he/she is going to commit a crime, and capturing a criminal before he/she actually becomes one. Tom Cruise is a police officer in 'Pre-crime' and turns out to be a future criminal.Tom Cruise was not bad in the character. Plot twists are quite clever but could be even better.The basic philosophy of the movie is worth thinking about.",7,1,2,28 October 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," This is a Johnny Depp movie
","This movie really belongs to Johnny Depp. I wonder what'd have this movie done without him. I began to watch 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' without any idea of who Johnny Depp was and what this movie was about. By the end of it, I was wondering, 'Who is this stunning actor acting Jack Sparrow?' I have watched some movies of Johnny Depp without being impressed by him, hence, without concerning about even his name. But this movie was elevated by none other's but Johnny Depp's acting. A movie is never complete without the team-work but someone has to be outstanding.Story, as it is obvious, is entire fiction but cleverly written and well handled. Action sequences are simple (compared to lots of other action flicks), but according to the story line, hence impressive. Special effects are stunning. All actors contributed in an impressive way. No one tried to be unreasonably clever (this is a common problem that I have noticed in Hollywood movies as non-English viewer.) It is not 'just-another-pirates-movie'. It is a must-watch.",10,0,2,6 March 2005
Insomnia," This is Al Pacino
","This is the first movie of Al Pacino that I ever saw. In my opinion, this is not a very special movie. It could be a one-hour TV drama. It was predictable to some extent. At some points, it is very boring. The only thing in the movie which inspired me was the acting of Al Pacino. His acting was superb, however, it hardly made 'Insomnia' a watchable movie. The only good thing this movie did to me was it introduced a great actor, Al Pacino, to me. Although, 'Insomnia' was not a good movie (IMHO) but since the day I watched it, I am a big fan of Al Pacino.The story revolves around the murder of a young woman and local writer. Al Pacino is to investigate the murder and gets caught by sleeplessness because of some reasons. Basic idea in the story is not bad. However, the way it was filmed was more like a TV drama.Good for killing some time if you are not feeling sleepy, because 'Insomnia' can make you fall asleep.",5,0,2,28 October 2005
Knowing," One of the greatest bad movies
","Let's face it; if you are not a hardcore science fiction fan, this movie is not for you. It is not a great movie but is so darn entertaining, I just don't care. It has so many plus points that they cover that big minus on the entire movie.Disaster scenes are so emotionally intense and moving you simply forget less than perfect computer graphics. Not very long ago, there was plane crash in a city that is very close to my heart. When I saw the plane crash in this movie, it got me very emotional; so emotional that it actually hurt. Even if you don't like this movie, just for that scene entire flick should be considered watching.Synopsis is good old 'end of the world'. Story has sometimes cartoonish touch. My all time favourite, Nicolas Cage, is not very impressive in it as far as his acting skills' demonstration goes. But, somehow, he fits the movie. That 'you, me, together, forever' father-son routine is painfully clichéd and marred the entire story. You'll know what I am talking about when you see the film.Curiously, after watching this movie, when I searched Internet for scientific fact-checking whether the destruction of entire planet earth by a super solar-flare was possible, I stumbled upon an astronomy discussion board where I saw a question titled 'Could a Solar Flare destroy life on our planet?' and the asker, a Silverman (obviously an internet nickname) mentioned that he was doing research for a 'script'. If it is the same person who wrote this movie, here is my message for him/her: Gone are the days when you could rely on interest for true information. Now it's the age of Wikipedia where information is created, not gathered.",9,0,4,19 September 2010
