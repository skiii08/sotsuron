Requiem for a Dream," Top Five
","Requiem for a Dream is by far one of the greatest movies around.  The acting is intense and captivating to say the least. Not to mention the camera work; exceptional and a perfect fit for the film.  Ellen Burstyn's role as Sara Goldfarb is one of the most powerful characters that I have ever seen in a film.  The emotion displayed by Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans (who, after this performance would only insult himself to be in another spoof film) couldn't be more real. The rise and fall that takes place in the plot left me nearly sick my stomach, but I loved every second of it.  I spent most of the film thinking to myself, 'No he's not gonna do that, there's no way anyone would want to do that.....Oh my god...He did it.'
As you can see, I can't say enough about Requiem, so I think I'll cut it off after one last thought. Though it will never happen because of all the parents, teachers, and administrators out there, this movie should be shown in EVERY school...no one would ever do drugs again.Perfect 10, unbelievable. I would watch grass grow if Aronofsky directed it.",10,0,1,18 July 2002
