Child 44," Thriller plot forgets thrills and plot
","What a bizarrely dull waste. The successful Child 44 book had three or four things going for it: a stunningly atmospheric opening in a winter of starvation (here rushed over and its relevance weakened), a big reveal (cut), the evolving relationship between Demidov and his wife as they first realize the emptiness of what they thought they had and then build anew (next to Noomi Rapace's pained wisdom Tom Hardy's Leo is a nice picture of inarticulate bewildered loyalty, war hero as premiership footballer out of his depth, but it doesn't go anywhere) and a reasonable cat-and-mouse/chase plot. Trying to squeeze in most of the narrative of the book, but still dropping a couple of significant facts and incidents, the film manages somehow to be both too long and too rushed. The Demidovs hurry back and forth across Russia having unpleasant train incidents, the commuter experience from hell, and then the mystery gets addressed in a couple of brisk and largely unrelated bits of business at the end. Espinosa worthily films most of the book, but loses its sense and its drama. Child 44 has some vivid styling and performances (largely for decoration – Cassel is intimidating because he's Cassel, nothing more; Oldman has to resort to maximum shouting-and-spitting to get any drama into his scenes; Dance, as so often, is paraded as a token of film gravity), but it's otherwise as empty and lifeless as its Siberian wilderness.The Script Hack (https://thescripthack.wordpress.com/): if we're skipping the plot relevance of the starvation opening, we can skip the whole scene; if we're dropping the key bits of information gained from the mid-story return to Moscow, we can drop that whole sequence; and we could trim some of the secondary scenes (the last, for example, nicely true to the book, could be 30 seconds instead of five minutes). That would create much more time and space to pace and build the mystery and anticipation and drama of the hunt, and the relationships at its heart, and still leave a tighter more powerful film.",3,1,3,30 July 2017
Bridge of Spies," Extraordinary true story becomes ordinary
","Steven Spielberg is getting awfully stately. He's always been family-friendly, but there used to be an energy, a bit of sass about him. Now the challenge to authority is no more than Tom Hanks being a bit smarter than the Government men, and the whole thing is played at an unchanging ceremonial pace at least as reverential as Lincoln.This is Cold War thriller become costume drama. Despite the genuinely tense storyline, and some normally bullet-proof anxiety scenes (crossing the wall! waiting on the bridge!), not once does the pulse get above what you'd get from watching the documentary.It's an extraordinary true story with the extraordinary taken out. And the interesting: there's some potentially really thoughtful stuff about Hank's relationship with Rylance, and where patriotism might be when American interests clash with American values, and what he's inflicting on his family by his stubbornness - but none of it comes to anything. Hanks attracts danger (more in America than in Germany) and shame, but then his family gets to see him on TV so it's all OK.https://thescripthack.wordpress.com",4,2,3,26 August 2016
Prometheus," unsuccessful genetic experiment
","HERE BE SPOILERSWell, it's all a bit of a muddle. Grand in scope and sometimes beautiful, but it feels like far too much got thrown into the mix and none of it really works. Oddly enough, it's as if Ridley Scott of all people lacked confidence in the different elements. The problem isn't that he's repackaging things like 2001 and Contact and of course Alien, but that the recipe works less well than any of the ingredients. (Or, to adopt the film's own theme, the inheritor is less successful than the ancestors.)There are too many characters to care about any of them. There are too many half-stories for any of them really to grip. There are too many ideas for any of them to make clear sense. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba enjoying a bit of casual whoopee would be ideal if you wanted to create the most glorious line of humans ever, but in Prometheus there's a sense that the big names are cameos rather than characters. I know Scott wasn't trying to remake Alien, but its focus on fewer characters and their affections and antipathies increased the claustrophobia and concern when they started getting slaughtered. Alien made space-travel seem mundane, made spacemen into long-distance truckers, and the literally alien horror was starker against this humanness. Prometheus's hi-tech crew are dehumanized themselves.There's an argument that all films, of any period and genre, should feature Theron in a catsuit. There's clearly an argument at the moment that all films should feature Michael Fassbender. Both are brilliant in this – Fassbender as Peter O'Toole/android as Lawrence of Arabia/O'Toole as perfect man is a film in itself – but I'm not sure there's enough room for them. Crucially, the half-developed theme of Fassbender the android as the old man's attempt to create a more perfect Theron (if you've not yet seen the film, don't even begin to try to unpick that line) is stifled by all the other half-developments, including the wider stuff around the old man and heredity, Noomi Rapace and her father and her incubation of the alien, and so on.(What happens if we tidy up a bit? Thin out the crowd, straighten the plot, get rid of some of the superfluous fathers, polish one or two central ideas? Say there's only one father, with two daughters: a natural one (Rapace) who disappoints him despite her efforts at science, and the android (Theron) he creates in the attempt at perfection and obedience. There's a much clearer tension at the heart of the story, between emotional questing human Rapace and cold rational perfect Theron. Lose Rapace's one-night-stand, along with some of the other cannon-fodder; instead have Theron impregnate her with the alien, partly because it's how to prolong the experiment and partly out of spite at the one capacity that human Rapace has that android Theron doesn't – reproduction. Madness, of course, because we'd never dream of losing Fassbender and his O'Toole. But the whole story would be tighter and stronger, and more clearly reflect the underlying theme of how the ancestors tried to shape and instrumentalize their descendants.)https://thescripthack.wordpress.com",6,1,3,30 July 2016
