Howl's Moving Castle," One word: wonderful
","I love this movie. It is so magical that you can't just describe it...you HAVE to watch it. Maybe someone won't understand it completely, but it just need you to dive in the story and be a part of it.And the story is about (so complicated so simple) a girl who get coursed by an old witch, forcing her to find a way to break this curse by joining a group of strange people (people?) who lives in a moving castle...Each character is well developed, the colors are amazing, the music and the atmosphere...i love it.Miyazaki gave us not just an animated movie, but a wonderful journey in the form of a magical dream. Don't miss this one.",9,1,2,20 August 2009
