Marie Antoinette," Beautifully presented, hard to follow for first timer's.
","Sofia Coppola shows us a sympathetic view of the ill fated Queen of France in this contemporary and youthful retelling of her young extravagant life. From her early marriage to Louis XVI at 14 to her reign as Queen at 18 and the beginning of the French Revolution and ultimately the fall of Versailles.Those of you who are not familiar with the story of Marie Antoinette or ultimately the French Revolution may find it hard to follow or rather pointless to watch as there is hardly any dialogue or explanation of the reason or cause. Or, to be fair, what she even had to do with it. Unmentioned in the film are her later incarceration, trial and execution.I was pleasantly surprised at Kirsten Dunst's performance as Marie Antoinette as I wasn't expecting much from her at all. She does a fine job of portraying a youthful and fun spirited Marie in her years of decadence and luxury.Beautiful and fun insight into the early life of Marie Antoinette as a young Queen, Mother, Party Girl and Socialite! A personal favourite.",7,0,0,7 March 2015
