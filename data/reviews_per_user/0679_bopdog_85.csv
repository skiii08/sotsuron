The Legend of Bagger Vance," Redford's best ever. Mystery, charm, grace... and great entertainment!
","This is great! When I saw 'A River Runs through It' I thought if Robert Redford never did another thing in his life, making that movie was enough. It would have provided a positive balance and karmic payback for all his life's mistakes (etc.). It would have given enough true artistic glory for him to bask in for the remainder of his days. Funny thing is, as much as I respected and admired that movie, I've never seen it again since that first time. 'Bagger Vance' is different, though. It is even better than anything Redford has ever done before-- and that's saying A LOT-- and I will for sure go and see this one again. Maybe twice more. It is uplifting. It is easy to love.'Bagger Vance' is: 'The Natural' meets 'A River Runs Through It' meets 'Good Will Hunting.' Sort of. It is about redemption, grace, mystery, and power. What makes it special is that the mysticism isn't magic. It isn't science fiction, or some far out fantasy deal. Rather, it is the actual, real, human mystery and magic that all of us live every day.Some critics may not like this movie, because as a rule, the pretentious, dysfunctional geeks who usually write movie reviews for a living are frightened when made to feel a bit more emotion or reality than they're used to. There are exceptions, of course, but... Feel sorry for those poor, repressed souls! 'Bagger Vance' is exuberant, lofty, loving, exciting, and meaningful. Oh, and immensely fun and very entertaining. Go see it-- you'll love it. I promise. I gave this a 10 out of 10, even though it deserved an '11.'",10,0,1,3 November 2000
Walk the Line," Masterful! Deeply inspirational, thrilling love story. And, I was not a Johnny Cash fan, either!
","I have just seen 'Walk the Line', and was very surprised. I expected a bio-pic, interesting, perhaps, but no big thing. What I saw was astounding. And I must point out that I have never been a particular Johnny Cash fan, either. So my total admiration for this movie comes from the movie itself, and not from any satisfaction at seeing the life of a personal hero. In fact, it was the reverse: my general distaste for Cash was an obstacle to overcome. And overcome it the movie really did. I am still not a fan of the music, particularly, but am now a fan and admirer of the people--- Johnny Cash and June Carter.First, Joaqin Phoenix was brilliant as Cash. I 'bought' his portrayal at all times. Whether he looks exactly like Cash or not is irrelevant, although he looked like him to me. His vibe and spirit were spot on. The fact that Phoenix did all his own singing was a bonus. What an amazing talent! Phoenix made Cash into a likable, complex, thoughtful, and 'deep' person. Given the Phoenix slant, I now have a genuine respect for the actual Cash.Reese Witherspoon was also astounding. Her Oscar nom was well deserved. As you know, she is a native of Tennessee (in the American South, and the state where Memphis and Nashville, the two capitals of country music are), so the Southern accent and old-timery Southern demeanor were natural and easy for her. More than doing a mere imitation of June Carter, though, Witherspoon also portrayed the loving and passionate woman Carter was in real life. With Witherspoon's portrayal, it was easy to believe that her love for, and belief in, her man could save him, turn his life around, and deliver him to greatness and peace.And the portrayal of the entire Carter family was also inspirational. The intelligent love, acceptance, and understanding of Johnny Cash by the Carter clan was truly heart-rending. I also enjoyed the scene where Daddy Carter appears brandishing a shotgun, chasing away Cash's erstwhile drug connection, while Cash was recovering in his bed, about to give up his drug addiction, go clean, and 'walk the line' for the woman he loved. Then, to hear the women's voices (Mother Maybelle Carter and June Carter) joining in with the Dad in chasing the drug dealer off, and then the camera shot of Mother Maybelle Carter also appearing with her own shotgun was breathtaking. With a family like that loving you and believing in you, when folks like that 'have your back', then anything is possible in this world.So, I was surprised and inspired by this movie, and Johnny Cash, and the Carter family. Who would have thought it was a great love story? Go see it, you'll love it! As a 'date movie', or as your once-a-year cinema experience. It's really worth the effort. I gave this a well-deserved 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,12 February 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hold on there Jethro--- this is OK, but great... NOT
","'Borat' has some laughs. But how hard is it to ridicule a bunch of lower class Bible-belt hicks and rednecks, though? That doesn't take much imagination, and seeing their earnest adaptation to ignorance and poverty, over and over and over, wears a bit thin. A lot of the humor here was a 'cheap shot'. I don't object, I just point out that while this is a mildly amusing movie, and a bold concept, it is not a great movie. It is certainly not 'the funniest movie in years', as some are claiming. Maybe it was the funniest movie this month.It also has a lot of cringes too--- such as the naked fat man whose belly fat hangs down so low that his genitals are obscured from sight--- most of the time. He and Borat wrestle around stark naked, and mouths and anuses touch. Ewwww. But whatever.I kind of admire Cohen's boldness in making this movie, and I don't object to any of it. That's not to say I was thoroughly entertained at all times, either. I could have done without much of it--- especially the 'real life' candid-camera kind of confrontational humor. I HATE that kind of thing, personally. Preying on other people's basic good naturedness is a bit cruel, as is 'stealing' glimpses of their rather dreary and crappy lives, and holding them up for ridicule. We all have stuff we wouldn't want some smart-ass filmmaker to tape and put on the screen without our knowledge, or at least without our fully understanding what the joke is supposed to be. This was definitely a case of laughing at people, not with them. As the late, great Eudora Welty remarked, proper comedy satire is a tool for the weak to 'get back at' the powerful. This was the other way around. The 'powerful', the movie crew, exploited the weak, the dullards who got trapped in Cohen's 'jokes'. That's not proper, it's not nice, and it's not really all that funny. It's mean spirited and ugly at times.I would ordinarily not be so negative about a comedian I kind of like, because he does bend the noses of the Right-Wing Christians, powerful warlords, and even so-called Liberals, and the like. Except that so many people are hem-kissing and drooling and genuflecting in front of this movie, and it simply isn't THAT funny, nor is it THAT good.",6,9,27,3 November 2006
The Monuments Men," 'Monuments Men' allowed me to enjoy a riveting and entertaining story about the best of humanity.
","I loved it. Anything with Matt Damon or George Clooney is an automatic 'Go see!' for me. Add John Goodman and Cate Blanchet and it only gets better. I heard one or two unflattering critics' comments about the movie a week or so ago, and was a little nervous that maybe the Laws of the Cosmos had been reversed in some fashion and the movie would not be good, despite its can't-lose topic and Oscar-great cast. I needn't have worried- it was marvelous.I don't want this to be about what's wrong with those critics, but perhaps you'll find a small bit of that helpful to decide that you should treat yourself to this wonderful project? I suspect that if anyone didn't find themselves entranced and entertained it might have been because they were expecting something else. 'Saving Captain America' or something.The film deals with choices we make as a people. What do we value? What might be worth fighting and dying for? Personal power, glory, and money? (read: the Nazis' and Stalinists' cause). Or human striving for charm and grace and love and compassion and harmony and 'art,' as imperfectly as we may have carried that out? (read: the Allies' cause, in principle, anyway).This IS a thrilling movie- but the thrills are very real, thus not sexy. I'm a scholar by trade (social psychology) and have studied this era and human relations extensively. As near as I can determine, this is how the war went for most people. And this project in real life, I hear, was rather quiet, and not thought to be glamorous- despite its 'monumental' importance and its consequences for humanity (pardon the pun).There is real danger in the movie. And suspense- made more gripping by the vast scale of the stakes... but of course made a bit more bearable by our knowledge that we won the war, and saved a vast chunk of our cultural heritage with the mission depicted in this movie.For myself, I felt a surge of pride toward the end when the movie showed filmed newsreel items, re-enacted from the day. Yes, it showed the Army generals gloating over the cache of more than one hundred tons (!!! - worth more than $4 BILLION at today's price) of stolen gold recovered from the salt mine where the Nazis had hidden it. Hey- I'd gloat too! But it also showed the overall integrity of the Allies illustrated by their care and concern to return the art - worth jillions of dollars - to the countries, families, cities, museums, that were the rightful owners.That just reminded me that while the flag-waving and money-making and glory-seeking may be the norm in this world, there are also millions of decent, honest, caring, compassionate, and spectacularly honorable humans among us. It feels good to know they were there then; it heartens me to suddenly realize that they are still out there today.'Monuments Men' allowed me to enjoy a riveting and entertaining story about the best of humanity.",10,29,57,8 February 2014
Catch Me If You Can," Well made, but romanticizing an evil, psychopathic criminal in this way is sick!
","I'd always thought these 'pretender' guys were in it for the thrill, the romance, the acting out of diverse roles, etc. That they loved the challenge, and that kind of thing. Didn't Tony Curtis play someone like that 30-40 years ago, also based on a true story? Anyway--- I was a bit surprised to find out that the Leo DiCaprio character was a criminal--- a thief, a forger, a rip-off artist merely in it for the cash. As he was portrayed in 'Catch Me If You Can,' he seemed psychopathic, cruel and fundamentally evil.This movie is unquestionably well-made. DiCaprio has displayed admirable maturity and power as an actor--- he no longer looks like a girl. he actually resembles a young Johnny Depp (and that's a good thing). Tom Hanks is also typically great. The 60s period setting is all good. But what I saw on the screen was a lot of innocent people having their lives ruined, in both big and some small ways: The would-be stewardesses who were humiliat ed, the fiance was unnecessarily hurt, her father was abused--- and why? What did those people do that made it OK for the movie audience to laugh out loud at their pain? The people who lost the $4 million dollars ($15 million in today's money), the various folks whose jobs were threatened, etc. How many families lost their income? How many elderly people suddenly could not retire as planned, but had to crawl off, unwanted, to some corner to die?Part of this movie wants us to somehow cheer for the Abagnale guy, to somehow 'see through his flaws' and yet love him anyway. Bulls***! Based on what the movie showed, he was a horrible, evil little vampire. Hurting, destroying, crapping all over decent folks. His victims weren't even guilty of that old cliche rationale movie con-men have so often used, that they were trying to gain unfair advantage themselves--- no, the victims had done nothing wrong. They were not 'up to anything.' They were merely trusting others, and being loving.For this reason, this otherwise very good Speilberg effort was a bit disgusting. Movies over the years such as 'Fitzwilly,' 'The Sting,' 'The Flim-Flam Man,' and 'Paper Moon' all romanticize and celebrate evil, because they all make light of thieves and seducers. But think about the people they hurt, the people they destroy--- somehow the victims are always forgotten in that Disneyesque focus on the cute little heroes. I'm sorry Steven, but the subject matter of this movie has gone too far. If you want to make a movie about Charles Manson the monster--- fine. I won't watch it, but at least the movie would be honest. To have made this movie about 'Frank Abagnale The Cute Misunderstood Thief Who Is Really A Romantic Hero' is sick.",6,1,5,25 December 2002
Marie Antoinette," Stupendous 'translation' of Marie's life and times for those of us alive today. Allows us to feel and experience what those folks felt and experienced, perhaps?
","Sophia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' works on all levels. It is a brilliant and spectacular portrayal of a long-past time; yet it also has an immediacy, and intimacy, and a warmth that draws us in and seduces us. The realness of the human dimensions, and the warmth and truth of the movie was truly surprising to me. I expected a bit of a chick flick--- but despite the 2-1/2 hours length, I was engaged right through the ending credits.Part of the success goes to Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman, of course. And the brilliant supporting cast, such as Rip Torn, as King Louis the 15th. And the surprisingly apt Molly Shannon, as the bitchy and cavilling Versailles court snob. But surely a ton of the credit must also go to Coppola, for the insightful writing, and inspired directorial choices.I have seen some of the nay-sayers for this movie criticize it on an historical accuracy basis. Fair enough. Maybe this or that aspect of the life of Marie Antoinette was not displayed fully, or 'just right'. But these critics are missing the whole point of THIS movie. THIS movie is not a 'bio pic', nor a flat, factual 'visual aid' for a history classroom.Think about it for a minute--- how do you portray other times, or other countries and cultures than your own, and those of the likely audience? Some artistic translation is required. If we could go back in time and plant hidden video cameras in Versailles from 1768-1790 (or whatever it was), what would we have? I doubt very much that we would understand any of what was happening. Because the times have changed, and the values and mores and norms and expectations have changed, AND the manner of expression for each of those things has changed--- I don't think 'real time' video footage of a long distant past age would even be comprehensible to us. We need a way to portray the values (etc., as above) in current terms, terms that we can feel and understand NOW.For example--- I noticed a party scene, where Coppola had modern, cool, very So-Cal music playing as the background. One might think 'Hey! That's not the 18th century!', and they would be right, of course. But the party vibe that we, the actual audience in 2006 might feel NOW--- the exuberance, the color, the fast moving interpersonal interactions, the joy and the abandon of a true party goer, lost in the happy, wacky party atmosphere of the moment--- all of that must be evoked to us now. Modern party music is an appropriate way to convey it.I have seen so many movies with an historical aspect, showing parties, dancing, social interactions from previous centuries, using music and speech from the time. That has its place, too. But often, what we get is a remote, stilted, unapproachable and unaccessible museumy-looking piece that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to relate to at all.So we, the audience, might be said to be experiencing and feeling the same vibe the actual 1780 crowd felt and experienced. We just had to have a slightly different means of evoking those feelings within us.It is analogous to a movie about ancient Greece, or modern Mongolia, or even France (if one is not French)--- the movie, if intended for an English-speaking audience, will be spoken in English, because that's what the audience speaks. No one would say--- 'How dare the director not have the actors speaking in ancient Babylonian, or ancient Greek, or Mongolian'. No. Equally, we are not offended when English language movies are translated into other languages, so other folks in other countries can enjoy them too. It's simple. It's called communication.Sophia Coppola, and the stellar cast, did a stupendous job of translating what it might have FELT like for the young Dauphine and then queen in the 18th century for us here in the 21st century. Also, do note that the movie was able to accurately get would it also looked like--- the filming was done on location, at the Versailles Palace itself.So--- tremendous and spectacular job all-round!!! I gave this a 10 out of 10.",10,9,17,21 October 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Seamless and brilliant enhancements bring the current eyeball-reality up to par with our cherished movie memories. Well done!
","I had fond memories of having seen 'E.T.' at the theaters when it originally came out in 1982. I have never seen it since, because the VHS was late and limited, and there was no DVD until now. Anyway--- upon watching the new DVD anniversary edition, I was re-charmed and re-enrolled in the Steven Speilberg fan club (so to speak). Wow!I watched the entire restored version, waiting for the 'new effects.' i never saw them. It looked like the 'E.T.' movie I had remembered. It was bright, deep, warm, engaging, and utterly cool. It was only upon watching the marvelous commentary portions on Disk Two that I got my answers, as to where the new stuff was. Speilberg does a shot-by-shot explanation of the enhancements. Nothing 'new' in the sense of added stuff--- by what looked great as sci-fi FX back in 1982 really DID look a bit stupid today. Not quite on the Flash Gordon level from the 1940s and 1950s, but pretty lame and stale. the enhancements added the sparkel and zong we now have come to expect from the techno advances of the California film industry. The new stuff really is seamless, and brilliant. It didn't 'change' anything--- it merely brought the current reality up to the level of our cherished movie memories. Well done Steven! 'E.T.' on DVD is a spectacular 10 out of 10 for me!",10,2,4,4 November 2002
If I Stay," Surprisingly evocative of my own early love development years. Sweet but slooooow
","This was certainly a 'lovely' film. It is obvious that the writer/director cared about presenting something genuine and touching - rather than some plot driven smash-a-thon. I could relate to the themes. They were telegraphed so clearly, however, there were no real surprises. We could see each line and exchange and development coming from a mile away - and the movie took forever to get to each tiny step (it's 2 hours and 15 minutes).It pains me a bit to say it, but the movie's glacial pace and repetitive nature slowed it down a bit too much. And how it would linger over each small movement in the two kids' relationship, and then go back over it and over it and over it - made it feel repetitive. I suspect women might find this more of a match to their style of fantasizing? If the movie wasn't so earnest, and 'real' in some very authentic ways, I would have found it annoyingly tedious. Didn't quite happen, though. I was surprised to find myself flashing back to some very sweet moments from my own teen-aged love affairs. It was sweetly evocative in that way, which I appreciated. I can't remember seeing a movie depicting the development of love with 'youths' turning into adults so authentically and with so much meaning for me. Usually romances are either rom-coms, or formula set-ups, or twinky vampire book treatments. Or set pieces from current hip culture. This was none of those. This was nice. Sloooow, but nice.Although the very predictable (and extremely limited and overly simple) plot points failed to 'move' me particularly - it was interesting but no big drama - I was generally liking all the characters. I was glad for the characters finding romance, and I enjoyed reliving a bit of my romantic development in a fresh way no other movie had managed to do. But getting all weeping with the deaths and near-deaths and reuniting and all - nope. It was just life, and no cause for any tear-jerking hullabaloo.",8,9,20,23 August 2014
Fight Club," Gritty but not grim; Almost Light and Soulful! Oscar nominations are a shoe-in!
","I was pleasantly surprised by 'Fight Club.' Based on reviews and previews, I expected something heavy, and with a cruel, grim, almost evil undertone. Much like the horribly negative 'Seven,' by the same director. 'Fight Club' was actually almost full of 'light.' It was, to be sure, gritty, and a little heavy-- but whether due to the actors (all Oscar quality performances, and Yaay! to Brad Pitt for finally doing some acting), or the writing or editing or the director-- it was fluid, humane, almost kind, and with a faint and subtle touch of humor. The humor was never overt-- it was something sensed, not heard. And not the mocking, sarcastic kind of humor one sometimes sees with 'artistes' who are a bit to full of themselves-- but an almost gentle, reassuring kind of zen-like reflectivity. This movie was actually about the Soul, and the human heart, and Life, and all that kind of thing. It was more about how to be a happy and successful human, and how to heal your 'broken' mind and heart and spirit, than a plot driven star vehicle (which was a nice bonus to me as an audience member, and a bit of a shock, given Brad Pitt and Helena B. Carter's movie track record).Again, based on the reviews I expected carnage galore. 'Rolling Stone' magazine, for example, had me thinking this was so violent it would be a nightmare, or vomit inducing. Nah. As usual, that mag got it wrong. First, the fighting and violence were not the overdone features I was expecting. Scene for scene, other movies such as 'Rocky' have shown the same thing. In fact, for a comparison meter, 'The Godfather' was far more unsettling and violent than 'Fight Club' (come to think of it, any of the 'Batman' movies are so dark, violent, and depressing, that 'Fight Club' looks like 'The Sound of Music' in comparison to them). But even when the movie's violence was depicted graphically, it wasn't particularly awful-- and I am a person who LOATHES graphic violence on-screen. Why wasn't the violence a problem? I don't know. I can't explain it. Maybe it was so subtle and/or surreal that it was processed differently in my brain. Maybe the richness and high quality of the story was so great that it overshadowed the gore (really, 'gore-lite'). I cannot say, but over all, this was a splendid affair!Oscar noms all around! Helena Bonham Carter was also a surprise-- her English accented Ice Queens and Frigid Virgins in previous roles are nowhere to be seen here. She authentically portrays the genuine article-- the American accent, anyway. She also seemed convincingly and consistently crazy, and that can be hard. So Hurray to John Cusac, Brad Pitt, and H.B. Carter.If you feared a horror show, or a testosterone-zone flick, fear not. Lighten up a touch, and slide on over to the theater. You'll be glad you did (although for mature audiences-- really! -- only). I gave it a '9.'",Null,0,1,15 October 1999
The Maze Runner," Kids may find it exciting and new. Over-35's will find it worn out and tiresome
","Didn't read the books. I did read The Hunger Games, and enjoyed books and movies. This one had its great moments, but overall fell a little flat for me - but I think that's an age issue. A generational problem. Not that I am too old to appreciate rebellion and questioning authority, but rather because I've seen all the 'Maze' tropes a hundred times before.Recycling old tropes isn't a bad thing, nor am I implying it's some kind of art crime! Rather, I am just noting that anyone over 35 may find it a bit old hat and even tired by now??? I'd have to add books to the list of 'The Maze' forerunners - Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World,' Michael Creighton books, and others I can't recall now. And all the 'Mad Max' movies - 'Logan's Run,' 'Lathe of Heaven,' and of course 'Lord of the Flies.' Even 1990's fare such as 'Water World' and 'The Postman' echo a bit here. And other movies I can't remember. Add the iconoclastic vibe, taking down The Man and The Establishment, and unethical experimentation and manipulation by The-Powers-That-Be, and you might already be wearied of 'The Maze' before you even get to the cinema.In some ways 'The Maze' has a trick ending, and relies too much of corny plot twists - 'Surprise!' wears thin. I could imagine that once someone knew the trick ending, the movie would be unwatchable. It would be way too silly, way too tedious and dull. Virtually unendurable to sit through. That's never a good sign for a movie.Katniss - she still holds interest, together with the whole Panem bunch for me!!! So I am not 'anti' anything. I just want a newer, fresher approach is all. If you're young - and this is your first exposure to these themes - go see 'The Maze' and go nuts and enjoy yourself! If you're a grown-up - don't expect anything new or fresh, or startling. It just isn't there.",5,0,1,22 September 2014
Captain Marvel," Loved it! FINALLY - adult themes in a Marvel movie! Marvel's best to date.
","I walked into the theater with low expectations, but was blown away. OMG - 'Captain Marvel' was AWESOME. I suspect the initial low ratings on IMDb were from 'fanboys' and other young people who wanted chases and shoot-em-ups - the kind of mass melees and Battle Royales seen in the Avenger gang fight movies. That's OK - each to his own taste! But this Marvel movie actually dealt with real and important themes that sucked me right in, and kept me riveted until the end.In my personal cosmology, on some level we are all the same, and time does not exist, except as a shared construct, and perception is projection (i.e., in some way we make it all up). OK - that's me. But to see Marvel wrestle with these ideas, present them in a fascinating and thrilling story-line, AND feature a cat? I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven. Do not be mislead - there is tons of action, too, and brilliant FX and Sci-Fi dazzle.And... it doesn't hurt that Brie Larson is sturdy, talented, and adorable. And this was Samuel L. Jackson's best role in what? 20 Years? He played a good guy for once... even kind of a hero. That sat VERY well on him. I hope he considers doing more positive movie roles henceforth.Bottom line: if you've been watching Marvel/DC movies with a child's eye, consider if it is time to step up to a grown-up version. You stand a chance of advancing your movie-art appreciation with this. Possibly. And if not, let enough time pass until you're ready for the adult world. Please consider that this might be a great movie to begin life like the grown-ups do it. You'll have a blast!",10,4,10,9 March 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Shamefull waste of talent and resources. Some bright bits, many tedious and ugly bits. It all adds up to nothing.
","What an ugly and un-inspired movie! Although watching this movie was a definite throwback to some of the old time Disney fare, and reminded me a bit of my childhood in movie theatres on a Saturday afternoon. Pirates was not quite as good as the dated but charming Swiss Family Robinson (1959, was it?), but it was about as bad as the dreadful Fitzwilly (1967).Visiting Disneyland, you see rubber rocks in the faked-up 'wilderness' area. How hard would real rocks be to get? Disney movies are equally prone to the fake, when audiences would probably accept the real, even if the real stuff was flawed. This shows a tremendous disrespect for the audience on Disney Studio's part. As an example of the weird moral 'logic' Disney CAN at times stoop to, consider Pretty Woman--- about a hooker who meets Mr. Right and strikes it rich. The moral lesson of that Disney flick, evidently, was that only money matters, and having some cash to flash, and a trendy wardrobe, automatically makes you a person worthy of social position and respect.Pirates has some moments that are interesting. But as you've probably heard, it's all flash, and no substance. There is no love, no romance, no likable characters we are rooting for. Nothing in the movie really matters. And some of the bits are so gruesome, gross, and ugly that I feel tainted merely by having seen them on the screen.This movie is like being shown some old lady's button collection. Some of the bits are pretty, some interesting. Some ugly, many are dull and plain. But they don't add up to anything at all. When you're done looking at the buttons, you have nothing. Not even a rag doll or a simple garment. Just the experience of having handled somebody else's second-hand buttons.Pirates of Caribbean, Deadman's Chest, is vapid at best, and immoral and a shameful waste of talent and resources at worst. Having just come from this dreck, I suspect the worst. I am embarrassed for the excellent and worthy cast. Disney should be ashamed. I need to go home and take a shower now.",3,8,16,7 July 2006
The Notebook," Mostly enjoyable, but also too formulaic and overly sentimental
","Overall, nice little movie. But it is also a bit 'tricked out.' That is, it is a bit manipulative and overly sentimental. I LIKE romantic movies, generally, and even some intensely emotional ones. I even cluck-cluck when film critics attack anything with strong emotions, or too-real humanity, mentally scolding them for their shallow self-anointed mantel of the too-cool.Point is, I usually defend the 'sentiments' of humanity in movies! But here, I was (and to my great surprise) put off a bit by some of the formulaic vibe of the movie. It was kind of corny, and silly, and inauthentic. Again, though, it was nonetheless watchable. I gave it a 6 out of 10, and would have posted a 6.5 if I could have.James Garner is magnificent in everything. Gena Rowlands is good, and good here. The guy, Ryan Gosling, may be a great human being, but his screen persona is too creepy for me (recall his total creep-out role in 'Murder by Numbers'). The chick was good--- Somebody Mc-Something. Don't know her name or work yet, but assume she will continue with a good career, and then everyone will know her.",6,12,22,13 July 2004
The Rocker," Believable, likable, and GREAT entertainment. Great music, too!
","I must admit I wasn't keen to see this movie. But I went because I'd seen everything else, and I wanted one more cinema fling before school starts. I am SO glad I did. The Rocker is GREAT! In my opinion, one of the potential downfalls of this kind of comedy, with an actor such as Rainn Wilson, is mugging (being overly cute for the camera, figuratively winking at the audience, etc.). To be kind, I won't mention examples of fatal cutesiness in other actors--- but you know what I mean. The Rocker avoided all of that, and came across as honest and friendly.What was refreshing, and very enjoyable here, was the heart in the movie. It has a sweetness and an authenticity I really enjoyed. Solid story, believable plot, and it is populated by characters who actually make choices, learn, and grow. Sounds soppy, perhaps--- but it works very well. The movie has substance to it, and is thoroughly entertaining.Lastly, I actually liked the A.D.D. music! I don't know who wrote it or sang it or any of that--- but if I had an album of it, or at least a few singles, I'd be pleased. Too bad it was all from a 'fake' band, and will probably never be heard again.",10,1,3,23 August 2008
Balls of Fury," Chuckle Out Loud. Quiet humour. No belly laughs, but lots of long and slow comedy, done fairly well.
","This definitely comes under the heading of 'Stoopid Comedies,' which I happen to really enjoy. But the jokes are more wit than belly laughs. There isn't much outright slapstick--- which I would have liked. The funny parts are quiet, although not particularly subtle. The humour is more from the mild delight of seeing some old-time character actors like James Hong and Christopher Walken play out some long and slow bits over the course of the movie. Some of the humour also comes from a bit of satire--- although not of the outright 'spoof' category. Mostly, it's just a series of improbable and goofy scenarios--- silly, whimsical, and with enough colour and dash to be enjoyable. If you want laugh out loud comedy--- you'll be disappointed, although I, and the audience, chuckled out loud.

Alexander," Appallingly bad! More like a panto than a movie. Angelina Jolie's accent is so bad, she sounds like Dracula
","Some of the sets used in this movie were great. I presume they were historically accurate? In any event, some of the scenes thus evoked were exotic and very appealing to the eye. The acting, the script, in fact, the rest of the movie, however, were appalling. 'Alexander' was more like a panto version of 'Braveheart' or 'Henry V' than anything real. There were awkward snippets of action, especially anything involving Alexander and his troops, that appear to have been stolen from 'Braveheart', Shakespeare's 'Henry V', and even 'Gone With the Wind'. One guesses that Oliver Stone might have imagined a much grander, more noble, and truly stirring combination of these elements. As it turned out, unfortunately for us in the audience, nothing fit.His international cast also seemed to be speaking in a variety of accents--- no one accent was selected by the director for the characters to use. The majority of the cast was British, so English and Scottish accents prevailed, but there were others. Angelina Jolie, for example, sometimes sounded Spanish, sometimes Russian, but mostly like Dracula. That was VERY strange! Overall, a real disappointment. It deserves a 1 out of 10, but given the nice sets, I gave it a 2.",2,0,2,4 February 2005
Hot Fuzz," VERY subtle! It builds and builds. Gets weirder and funnier--an exquisite crescendo of thrilling humour!
","'Hot Fuzz' was not at all what I expected from the trailers--- but I LOVED this movie! It is quintessentially British, goofy and charming, with enough dead-pan 'serious' bits to set yo up for the absurd and hilarious comedy.The plot is simple. A hot-dog London Met super-cop gets on everyone's nerves in his London cop precinct. They transfer him out because he 'makes us all look bad'. He gets sent, with a promotion to Sargent, to a peaceful village called Sandford. As it happens, my house-mates are all coppers (really). They tell me that Sandford is used in UK police training, and amongst British coppers, as a clichÃ© for the stereotype peaceful English village. Similar, in American jargon, to 'Anytown, USA', or perhaps 'Mayberry', fictional home of TV's Sheriff Andy Taylor and goofy over-eager nerd Deputy Barny Fife.Anyway--- the situations are never presented as slap-stick, which surprised me. They are KIND OF played 'straight'--- except they develop, scene by scene, into situations so surreal and so silly and funny and thrilling--- I can't say more without giving away the plot. But I can say that in an odd way, this movie is more realistic in its depiction of English country life than many so-called 'straight' dramas.The whole thing is a masterful build up--- a crescendo that builds and builds for the entire two hours, culminating in some of the charmingest and funniest and excitingest scenes in any comedy I have ever seen.This is a great good time. I saw it in a packed theatre tonight--- and while there weren't the kind of huge belly-laughs and raucous laughter one enjoys in some types of wacky comedy, the audience did laugh a LOT, did not squirm--- no one slipped out to loo during the entire time, and during the credits the bulk of the audience stayed in their seats for quite a while. I, and I think they, seemed to enjoy simply basking in the glow of this wonderful and lovingly made, silly, goofy, wild, and oddly touching British comedy. Thank you, American studio Universal, for producing it, and evidently paying for it. I LOVED this movie!!! I gave it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,16 February 2007
Chicken Run," Charming, clever, but does it MEAN anything? It's cute but vapid.
","No doubt at all that this is a masterpiece of animation. or at least a sub-species of animation. Clay and computers blend here for some smooth, convincing action. Some funny spots, even some mildly interesting ones-- but except for a few isolated highlights, the whole thing was a bit vapid. Kind of empty. I thought of it a bit like Jello (gelatin desert): It's colorful, it jiggles, it can have nice shapes, but after all of that, it's not much.Contrast this movie with the recent family & kids' movie, 'My Dog Skip.' Even with its occasional contrivances, 'My Dog Skip' was a real story about real people in real situations. Think of it as eating fresh strawberries. 'Chicken Run,' on the other hand, was like strawberry flavored Jello. Not a bad thing-- hey, I eat it!-- but not actually real, either. And therefore not actually satisfying.For those who wonder if animation can be made into an engaging movie-- go and see 'Titan A.E.,' or either of the 'Toy Story' movies or any number of other animated movies from Japan, Disney Studios, Warner Bros, and others-- there's lots of good stuff out there. In summary, 'Chicken Run' was VERY well done technically, and it's moderately entertaining, but it left me craving more dramatic/comedic nourishment, too. For its technological skill, and semi-risky chances, I gave this a very generous 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,25 June 2000
The Day After Tomorrow," Somewhat engaging, Somewhat dumb--- But fun!
","I expected a silly but entertaining movie, and was mostly rewarded. The first half of the movie was totally engaging for me. I appreciated the science, even if it may have stretched a bit, explaining how things could freeze so fast. The second half was less satisfying, what with the love story and family thing going on. The second half, to be frank, was stupid, and didn't quite work. But overall, the movie was an above-adequate entertainment. Dennis Quaid is always good, and was enjoyable here. Ian Home was typically amazing and very watchable as well. Jake Guyllenhaal (Sp?) is a recently rising actor, and was less of THE 'Toby McGuire wannabe' that he seemed to be in the past. Must be coming into his own, and that's a sign that we may see more good things from him in the future. The rest of the cast seemed fine, with no particular stand-outs.",6,0,1,14 June 2004
X-Men," Amazing next generation effects-- plus a superb movie all 'round!
","A marvelous, spectacular movie!!! Very un-Batmanny, un-cartoony. None of that dark, brooding self-indulgent crap that has marred so many cartoon adaptations in the past. In fact, if I didn't know this was an adaptation of a comic book, I honestly wouldn't have guessed it.First, the special effects are genuinely a new generation of anything seen before. Truly! I know that may sound trite, and maybe not appealing, but that's one of the reasons the effects here are sooooo good. They are so smooth and integrated into the story that at no time did I think: 'Oh, a special effect.' I just found myself watching and believing and enjoying the movie without much self consciousness or self-awareness of being an audience member. And that's a high achievement for ANY movie.I am NOT a fan of the genre, particularly, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this one. And I suspect that the great actor Patrick Stewart may find his star with this role. He was so good, and so believable and natural that I had to squint my brain to even recall that he was Captain What's-his-name for all those years (and I love that portrayal, too, and hope to see a few more movies yet in that franchise). And the entire cast was wonderful too.Great job. Fantastic accomplishment-- made a fan out of me. Stop reading this and go to the theater and see it right away-- you'll be very glad you did! I gave this a well deserved 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,15 July 2000
Yes Man," Pure joy. A great film, true to its rom-com genre roots. I was uplifted, and grandly entertained!
","Yes Man was a delight to watch. Critics had panned it a bit, but unfairly, in my view. Granted, it is formulaic, but it IS a rom-com, and rom-coms have formulas. What made this film so great was the natural charm of Zooey Deschanel. She is beautiful, of course, but not in a 'model-y' kind of way. She has always had a freshness and honesty about her that makes her appealing. When I first saw her in 'Almost Famous,' playing the older sister, I wished I had an older sister like that. When she played the girl lead in Big Trouble, she was quirky, but without any of the self-aware conceit that can often accompany quirky young female actors. I will be kind and avoid names, but perhaps you can picture in your mind some of the 'Tragically Hip' and oh-so-cool young actresses who do quirk with a smirk. Zooey Deschanel has an innocence and a friendly quality that really make her shine, in the way a flower shines.Jim Carrey was also very good in this. He is who he is--- goofy and loopy and elastic. This wasn't a 'Serious Role,' such as Truman Show serious--- but wasn't over the top like Ace Ventura. Maybe he's mellowed with age. I liked him as a wild kid, but like him even more now that he is a bit 'evened out.' He is still hilarious--- but also a bit more human, and a bit more approachable.This movie runs through its rom-com paces, but each new scene, while a bit predictable, was nonetheless a pleasure. I felt uplifted by the end, and am very glad I went, even in the blizzard occurring where I am now staying. It was worth it!",6,232,302,20 December 2008
The Beach," I appreciated and enjoyed it, even with its major flaw
","There is a lot to like here, even though there are some major flaws, too. At first I thought it starred Matt Damon, who is great, but in the lobby of the theater on the way in I saw it starred Leonardo DeWatchimacallit, who I dislike and distrust. So I was prepared to hate 'The Beach,' but was surprised at how very good it was. I was particularly impressed with Leonardo, who I had previously thought of as nothing more than a giggling trifle. He can act! And he can come off as a actual man, too, not just the foppish object of teeny-bopper desire. Good job, bud!The first hour is powerful, mysterious, beautiful, and very engaging. The second hour is probably where the detractors were turned off. Admittedly, the conceptual material becomes really corny-- the type of obvious, belabored ideas about hedonism, love, character, etc. that one would expect from a precocious 19 year-old. I imagine that 35 years ago 'The Beach' would have been a stunner-- and it would have been hailed as a gripping, bold view into the darker parts of the human heart. Now, the moral lessons and conclusions seem naive to the point of silliness. But wait! In spite of that, there is something about this movie that is immensely rewarding and entertaining. A vibe of pure power, and a vibrant life emanate from every scene. I can't explain it beyond that-- this movie has LIFE. And it is technically perfect, too. Visually amazing, well acted, well edited, etc.  It's kind of the opposite of the recent movie 'Snow Falling on Cedars,' in which the scenery was rare and imposing (lots of snow on lots of cedars), but it was empty and sterile. As a movie it struck many folks as lifeless and dreary. 'The Beach,' by contrast, looks like a masterpiece, and feels like a great movie-- even though the story kind of falls apart towards the end. Often times flawed movies piss one off, but this movie won me over and had me appreciating it even as I was seeing the conclusion as amateurishly juvenile. Go figure?I gave this flick an '8.'",8,1,2,12 February 2000
Pan's Labyrinth," Brutal and lovely. Perfect! Its dramatic intensity will stun you!
","I believed them on 'Front Row', on BBC Radio 4, when they said this was a tremendous 'fairy tale' for adults. They also said it was NOT in any way, shape, or form for children. They were right. It does, indeed, hearken back to the original Brothers Grimm, and the older form of fairy tale, which was violent and very intense. Contrast this with the dumbed-down nursery tales pumped out by virtually everybody else, especially Disney.Disney fairy tale stuff is fine for 3 to 8 year-olds. And they do some great movies for adults, too. But Disney's over-sanitized cutsie-a-thons even troubled me as a child. My dad gave me the book 'Pinochio', published ca. 1900, when I was 10. It was a long, brutal, and scary story, very exciting and satisfying. Nothing like the treacle the Disney movie dished up to us. This is not to beat up Disney--- they do fine work, for what it is: morally ambiguous, maudlin, saccharine tales suitable for the uncritical. But do, do, DO understand that this movie is as far from anything Disney has ever even contemplated as possible. This is not for kids. It is for you. It is deep, serious, and as thrilling and exciting as any war movie, murder mystery, or family drama you'll ever see.I was intrigued throughout, and uplifted and gratified by the end. Clearly, this spectacular beauty is a masterpiece! I gave it a well deserved 10 out of 10.",10,9,18,25 November 2006
Begin Again," Keira Knightly shines, but otherwise it's a poor imitation of 'Once'
","This is a mixed bag - Keira Knightly, as always, brings a charisma and warmth that make almost any movie worth experiencing. Sadly, it is only her warmth and charms that kept this movie afloat through what was a lot of straining and over-efforting with pieces that did not quite succeed. The pieces were poorly done, and did not really fit together into a coherent and fluid narrative. The fails are three-fold: 1) The music. This might be just my taste, but I found it lame and flat. And rather than showing a mastery of music that takes us beneath the veneer of 'pop' and commercial product we are continually sold, the writer displayed a shockingly superficial grasp of the art form. For example, when the Keira Knightly and Mark Ruffalo characters discuss the music that inspired their lives, instead of introducing us to a wonderful and delightful new paradigm of music we may not have been familiar with, all the script did was halfheartedly mention a few stiff and silly clichés.2) Ruffalo's character's behavior was really just a clown show. A fine actor, he was given a series of set pieces as if from a TV movie - and was ACTING bits of the drunken has-been on the verge of rediscovering his family and his integrity and his career, rather than someone actually living that, or doing that. His over-wrought histrionics were, therefore, clownish - unconvincing. One was completely unmoved at those empty displays of 'emote-by-the-numbers.' 3) Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener were both rather wasted. Hailee is a very young Oscar nominee with a bright future, but her character's story arc didn't go anywhere. Her character had no spark, nothing that really set her apart as anything specific or meaningful. Similarly the older but equally appealing Catherine Keener also didn't have much to do. Aside from expressing a few standard ex-wife and 'mom' concerns (she played Hailee's mother), her character didn't do much in the story. Certainly in both cases both of the women were under-used. Both of those otherwise talented and brilliant female actors could just as easily have not been in this movie - and no one would have noticed their absence, their characters had such a teensy impact. And that is the fault of the writer/director, not the actors.As the movie wound down to the final act I had an inkling that this was a limp attempt to rip-off the really great indie movie 'Once.' Except this did not have the spontaneity of 'Once,' nor the artistic musical sense of that movie. I was shocked to read, later that night, that this movie was written and directed by the same guy who did 'Once.' That is sad - he aimed for a repeat of his earlier success, but completely and utterly failed to capture any but the most superficial resemblance.He would have been better to have steered clear of music and any other similarities to 'Once,' and made a movie about welding. Or beekeeping. Or something. It could only have been more interesting, more authentic, and more satisfying than this clunker.Overall it was really a '4,' but the otherwise talented cast made it a '5' (even though they bombed here), and Keira Knightly's good vibes made it a '6' (even though her movies are usually 10s).",6,7,13,14 July 2014
Closer," Better than I expected. More than a mere emetic, it evoked love, joy, and goodness in me!
","This was way better than I had expected, based on what folks were saying. It was good to hear some things, though. The characters in this movie ARE odious. They are selfish and scheming and snotty and thoroughly unlikeable. Having said that, their self-centered actions DO represent an aspect of the darker side of all of us. Or, maybe, not so much the darker side, as the lower end of our potential. In other words, most of us have been one of those characters at one time or another. And watching this movie evoked the extreme of that. The movie kind of 'rubbed our noses in it', so to speak. It's more than a mere emetic, however. It was also grimly fascinating to watch. Something stirred inside me, not just recognizing the lower side of things, but my reaction to it all, which brought out the better part of me.Julia Roberts was sensational. I must confess to never having liked her much before. She always struck me as a light-weight. But dang--- she was the co-best part of the movie, sharing that brilliance with the amazing Natalie Portman. The two of them proved themselves as actors of the highest caliber.The boys--- Jude Law and Clive Owen--- I cannot say. Their characters were pretty scummy and unsavory. Maybe the male actors were so good that those nasty qualities naturally oozed out of the screen and onto their real-life personalities? That is to say, I didn't like them at all. But, perhaps the male actors were simply so artful and so convincing in their portrayals that my distaste was for the characters, and not the actors. Dunno... But I am made suspicious by the fact that so far in my movie going career as an audience member, Jude Law has played creeps almost every time (Enemies at the Gate notwithstanding).I gave this a juicy 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,24 January 2005
Glory," A miraculous and brilliant movie-- ALL the history must be considered, however!!!
","Director Zwick set out for a really tough task when he decided to make 'Glory.' Think about it--- he wants to combine solid entertainment with accurate history. PLUS--- he wants to capture one of the core values of the American psyche, our Civil war, and do justice to all of it in a couple of hours. First, all those who carp and nitpick upon the film's possible lack of 'divine perfection' should be ashamed! Given all those goals, Zwick, his technical crews, and the superb cast all did a magnificent job. The movie is brilliant. Second, a better understanding of the history might help appreciate this marvelous achievement.Some have knocked the Col. Robert Gould Shaw character as whimpy and pale, too young to be a proper colonel. Hey--- this is the history part: The actor Matthew Broderick actually looks exactly like actual photos of Shaw. Shaw WAS young, and he was the pampered son of a rich family. Can't help that now-- that's what happened. And regardless of his whimpiness, note that he DID willingly go off to battle with the 54th, losing his life in the process. Letters from members of the 54th recount how much Shaw was devoted to his men and the whole social evolutionary process the 54th experiment was engaged in. Evidently Shaw was genuinely loved and respected by his men. Eyewitnesses in the midst of the battle itself report that Shaw was indeed a brave and inspirational officer right up to the end.History can never be effectively understood through the values of the present. Any historian or historician will tell you that. Historical events must be understood in terms of the times in which they occurred. Slavery is an evil and horrible thing on any continent, in any culture, and in any century. Given the circumstances that it did exist, however, one must view the recovery process from slavery realistically. To recover from slavery--- as a slave or a slave-holder--- could not have been an easy or quick process. It was probably extremely difficult, and probably required an heroic amount of strength, endurance, and courage. Certainly many folks of those times undoubtedly never made the transition, and suffered for the rest of their lives in one way or the other.The heroism of those who took the steps that they could take in those times should not be sullied or unvaunted merely because we modern people find the whole episode embarrassing or unbefitting our modern self-righteous self-important notions of how people are 'supposed to act.'The marvelous actor Morgan Freeman, a real hero of mine, says on the 'Glory' DVD commentary that President Lincoln was not interested in freeing the slaves, and was not interested in black freedoms, as evidenced by the fact that the Emancipation Proclamation (the decree that 'freed the slaves') was not issued until 1863, two years after the Civil War started. Perhaps-- but I have heard history professors and 'Lincoln experts' lecture that Lincoln's interest in abolishing slavery was genuine and a guiding force of his political and public life for many years before he became president. These Lincoln historians said that Lincoln was also a consummate politician and realist--- i.e., he knew that to agitate for emancipation before the Union forces began to win battles was futile. In fact, his realistic appraisal of the times in which he lived was such that he knew that to emancipate the slaves any earlier would have shattered the Union, split all of his support, and lost the war. In effect, bad timing in the political realities of the day would have established the Confederacy and its slave economy forever. Thus, Lincoln the realist timed his actions in the only way he could have and still achieved his goals of ending the horrors of slavery.Lest our British cousins feel any degree of superiority about this bit of 'dirty laundry' in our American past, recall that Britain only outlawed slavery in 1850--- a scant 13 years before Lincoln. AND, the British government tried to enter the American Civil War on the side of the Confederates, in exchange for which the British would have access to the largest cotton supply in the world at that time, along with the cheap slave labor (Shocked? Look it up!). The American Southerners would have received inclusion in the British aristocracy--- dukes, earls, knights, and what-nots. What ultimately prevented this 3rd British invasion of America was the British working-class mill-workers. They protested and rioted by the tens-of-thousands, and threatened to revolt if Britain went ahead with their new war plans. Did the British Poor riot to defend the rights of the American slaves? Or to protect their own jobs? Doesn't matter. Maybe both reasons--- but their stubborness did save the Union and effectively insure the freedom of the slaves here.Sorry for the speech-- the point is that any historical decade in a country such as ours is a VERY complicated affair. The wonderful movie 'Glory' does a miraculous job--- not telling every story, of course, but of telling SOME of the stories, some of the truth, and conveying a vibe that was historically and spiritually consistent with all the stories. And to the millions of Afro-Americans who stayed away from this movie, perhaps because it is too painful to watch--- be proud, be brave, and celebrate what your great-great-great-grandfathers did. It is an amazing story, and 'Glory' tells it well.",10,1,2,27 May 2002
Gone Baby Gone," Signs of a first-time director, but still pretty good. Great cast!
","Actors making their first movie as a director often show signs of the novice. So I find myself critiquing such efforts differently, even if that is unfair or not totally logical. The cast here was superb, the performances excellent. The story had depth, and you could tell that Ben Affleck and his writing partner really tried hard to do something real and meaningful. And... it is nice to be in the States this autumn and winter, to see new movies as they come out!Nonetheless, as is often the case, there were some tell-tale newbie marks. I don't know exactly how to articulate it--- but maybe an overly stated drama? Or times when things veer toward the obvious, or the melodramatic? Well, not quite melodramatic, here. But without giving anything away, let me just remark that for me, some of the choices made by the lead character, and aspects of the denouement of story, seemed a little too harshly, or simplistically, drawn. I certainly thought what the lead guy, played admirably by Ben Affleck's younger brother Casey Affleck, decided to do at the end was stupid. I thought the character's decision to follow the letter of the law, and turn all the morally 'goods guys' in to the police, was selfish, immature, and the mark of a guy who is WAY too full of himself. Rather than seeing that as a Greek tragedy, where the hero is doomed to follow his crappy destiny, or whatever, I saw it as an indulgent and destructive action of a narcissist. His wonderful girlfriend was absolutely right to dump his sorry bum, and walk out on him.So--- was it entertaining? Yes. And pretty good, and worthy to go and see. This may, like with some other actors-turned-auteur, be Affleck's only directorial job. Or, he may keep on and do some more--- he can only get stronger.Affleck's novice efforts reveal a certain timidity. He was too timid and weak to make a really strong statement about life, in my view. He kind of copped out, and kind of took the easy way, in the story's ending. But, hey, he DID give it a go, and he did a nice job.If this were a seasoned director's movie, I'd give it a 7. But out of affection and admiration for the 'new guy's' try, I give it a special-case 9 out of 10.",9,2,6,19 October 2007
Léon: The Professional," Different movie now than in 1994-- Besson's artistic vision is now understood
","I just saw 'Leon' on DVD. Missed it in the theaters. I read some reviews (now, in late 2001), and noticed that some respected reviewers were properly concerned about the young age of the heroine, the then 12 year-old Natalie Portman. Funnily, those 1994 concerns were washed away by events since 1994. Natalie grew up: Now she's un-twisted, wholesome, and gorgeous (and adult). Luc Besson, the director, made 'The Fifth Element,' among others. With 'Element' we see a definite trend emerging in Besson's work. Some of the scenes in 'Leon' were EXACTLY like some of the scenes in 'Element'-- same Moroccan music, same words, similar casting, same vibe.Not that it's a bad thing. Just notice that with 'Leon' in 1994, critics were trying to get a 'fix' on Besson, talking about 'Leon' in terms of 'La Femme Nakita.' That put an entirely different spin of 'Leon.' But with subsequent movies, we can now re-position Besson's stuff, and understand his movies, including 'Leon,' better.So, think of this: 'La Femme Nakita' was Besson's whole thing applied to politics and spies. 'Leon' is is Besson upon crime, love (especially the wholesome filial). 'Fifth Element' is Besson on Sci-Fi, and 'The Messenger' is Besson on culture, and native French pride (and not a very good movie, either).'Leon' was good, especially with Reno and Portman. The New York City, and NYPD aspect was SO impossible and foreign to any conceivable reality, that it seemed to be taking place in Morocco, or Frankfurt, or Paris, or ANYWHERE but in the U.S. (for my foreign friends-- trust me, the police behavior is not even remotely akin to reality, thus was peculiar and odd, rather than exciting. Couldn't happen!) Note-- bad things CAN happen-- just the fantasies of Paris-born Besson were so far removed as to be silly. His far-reaching and ungrounded imaginations worked best in 'The Fifth Element,' because as a sci-fi world, there IS no standard of expectation or other reality-tempering structure.Besson's all right. OK. Just know that all of his cinematic expressions sure seem to emerge from the same distinct, and fantasy-based, vision. That can be refreshing!",9,0,1,16 December 2001
American Pie," Way better than standard teen sex movies-- Funny, sexy, and has a heart!
","Much better than the usual teen-sex-glitz-farce. I watched the unrated version of 'American Pie' on DVD the same week I also watched '10 Things I Hate About You,' and the contrast between the two was clear. Both movies are a little gross for some tastes, and probably will concern or even offend a portion of the population. But beyond that kind of knee-jerk 'tut-tutting' in the media there is a very good reason to enjoy 'American Pie': It's a very good movie.I avoided 'American Pie' in the theaters because the trailers and the reviewers focused on the 'hi-jinx' aspect-- clumsy, self-absorbed boys running amuck while trying to satisfy their physical urges without regard to any higher values such as love, relationship, appreciation of their fellow human beings, etc. At the urging of my parents, however, I watched the DVD, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie indeed had a heart. As well as a bunch of crude, funny material-- solid comedy.Without revealing the outcomes of the 'plot'-- let me just say that the characters undergo a believable redemption and maturing that would be a high point in any 'chick movie.' I hesitate to give praise here at others' expense, yet I think it is important to note the vivid contrast of this fine and good hearted movie with another teen sex flick: '10 Things I Hate About You,' which was released about the same time. '10 Things...,' as with so many movies in this genre, was mean, low-spirited, and viciously hostile. It was an insult to the audience, especially in its vulgar depiction of adolescent boys as perverts and buffoons, and adolescent girls as greedy, ego driven bitches. That's bad!  It perverted what is otherwise a normal part of human life-- wholesome, randy good humor.'American Pie' has a good heart, and a good eye. See it and laugh, but don't be surprised if you also get a tiny bit edified at the same time. Oh-- the commentary track on the DVD is also great-- The director, the writer, I think, and several of the actors all appear together with spirited good humor and genuinely informative info-- that alone is worth the DVD price!",9,0,0,16 January 2000
Burn After Reading," J.K. Simmons stole the show-- and was hilarious.
","There are different dimensions to a film, of course. They could be great or so-so on their own, and appreciated thusly. How they all come together, however, makes the movie a good one or not. This film has great actors, all doing a marvellous job. But the plot is so oblique that I didn't quite 'enjoy' the movie, despite the great bit of dark humour toward the end.J.K. Simmons stole the show here. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovitch, and the others, did a splendid job--- no complaints. But J. K. Simmons' character was the only truly funny one. The interaction with him toward the end was actually my one nice memory. Malkovitch chopping the the gym manager up with a hatchet was absurd, of course, but completely appropriate, in a weird and perverse way, and totally apt. Sounds gruesome, but it wasn't--- it was hilarious. And Simmon's matter of fact approval of that deed was priceless. The rest of the film, though, was so dark and loony, and about total losers, so it was actually more depressing than funny.Simmons, who played so many authoritarian and 'hard' characters in his career, seems to have discovered a new vein of talent, and perhaps a new career for himself. First, last year he was the grounded and loving dad in 'Juno.' Now, while this character was 'blissfully out of it,' he had a similar presence. One liked him in Juno, one likes him here for much the same reason.",7,1,5,12 September 2008
The Bourne Identity," Damon and Potente are brilliant! Ludlum's best movie by far.
","I've never been a fan of Ludlum's novels, but I love this movie. I read the first 6 or 7 Ludlum books--- and they all seemed to be the same plot, same characters, same implausible and tedious world-spy-villain conspiracies, etc. Either Ludlum has matured, and now writes better books, or else this screenplay simply departed from his norm and did something different (Ludlum is also credited as 'Executive Producer' of this flick, whatever that means). This movie version of a Ludlum book has snap, depth, and an interest that goes far beyond Ludlum's 1970s and 1980s work.Matt Damon is brilliant--- he has a believability and warmth that most other 'action star' kind of doods sorely lack. Franka Potente really establishes herself as an amazing and wonderful new international star. She spoke English before, in 'Blow,' but had a limited role in that movie. Here she gets to be the co-star, holds a major role and carries almost as much of the flick as Matt Damon. She is the real deal! Her intelligence, grace, and charm of course always shined through to American audiences in her German language roles. She is equally attractive and compelling speaking English this time. I expect to see much more of her in the future.Overall, a great movie, and a great couple of hours spent in the theater. Top-notch entertainment!",10,0,1,15 June 2002
Baby Driver," Over-hyped! Tarantino-style wannabe that mostly fails
","Here's a nutshell version why 'Baby Driver' failed: Director Edgar Wright did some great 'homemade-style' British indie flicks: 'Hot Fuzz,' 'Shaun of the Dead,' 'World's End.' With Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (and many other great British actors, like Bill Nighy, etc.), the small indie UK movies could be small, because the talent was so huge. They could be a bit 'loose', even sloppy. It was OK with those previous hits, because the wonderful cast filled up the screen for the audience, and kept them entranced. 'Baby Driver' was simply too big for Wright's casual, loopy style, however. What might seem charming in a casual context can now seem woefully under-developed. The movie came off more as unfocused and an annoying, disjointed ramble (albeit a frenetic one), than creative and edgy.Lots of hype with 'Baby Driver,' but sadly, it is misplaced. The vaunted soundtrack is meh - 'OK' but not memorable. The music sounded geriatric, as if it was being played on a desk-top stereo by someone's Nan, at her Rest Home on an afternoon when she was feeling frisky. The actors are superb! But the overall theme and direction has mislead them into a no-win confused mess.Yes, there is LOTS of action. LOTS of violence. LOTS of the 'no talk, just shoot' heroics that so often can be energizing and refreshing in a macho action movie. But here it just comes off as cruel, even creepy. In fact, after this movie was over I was stuck with the nagging feeling that this was little more than a flabby rip-off of Quentin Tarantino's style. While Edgar Wright is undoubtedly a lovely man in person, and possesses many other talents, as a director, he is no Tarantino (after all, Tarantino is just barely Tarantino).One trembles a bit when one considers what last year's amazing 'Antman' would have been like had Wright, and his uneven lounge-party style, not been replaced!",1,54,103,28 June 2017
U-571," DVD edition improves over the theatrical release
","Just as we'd expect from the better DVD commentaries and documentaries that accompany movies, this one adds dimensions additional to the flick itself, and add to our enjoyment of the flick. At the time, I was irritated at the theatrical release of 'U-571.' The special effects are kind of lame-- wooden and fake. The the 'all-too-human' hesitations of the supposed 'excellent' executive officer would never happen in real military life. The guy simply would NEVER have made it that far or lasted that long with that kind of psycho-drama going on. And the insubordination displayed by some of the crew would also never have been tolerated in a real military situation. The mouthy, smart-assed crewman Mazola, for example, would have been shot on the spot in a real combat situation. Really.But then you watch the making-of segments, and you hear the film school dude-- Mostlow, I think, talk about the kind of movie he wanted to make: An actual replication of a 1940s era WW II movie. And elderly Dino DeLarentus talking in the same vein-- and then you get it. And the effects guys and the set designers and the costume lady show off the research they did, and you appreciate 'U-571' even more.OK-- it's a little cheesy, a little corn-ball. But knowing what the producers and director set out to do, it's also spot-on entertainment!One point that should be addressed: Some British viewers wrote early on that the movie was 'bad' because it insinuates that the Americans first captured Enigma, rather than the British. The points should be made: 1) No American student of history would ever deny the British the hallmark of being the first to capture the Enigma device (although the British actually had their first machine delivered to them by a Finnish businessman; it wasn't captured). Everybody over here knows that the British combined bravery and genius to round up a few of these priceless gizmos, and contrive Bletchley Park's amazing and heroic team of code breakers and communications analysts on a scale almost equalling America's Manhattan Project. Yaay Britain. It is also true that even with the machines, there was much more work to do. Consider that by mid 1942, the movie's time frame, the allies (due, of course, to the British) had the Enigma machine for close to 2 years, and we still had NO idea what the German U-Boat service was saying to itself. And, the Americans had been able to crack the tough Japanese 'blue' Naval Code that same year, in time to defeat the Japanese at Midway, without an Enigma machine. And with continuing mechanical and cryptographical improvements and alterations introduced by the Axis Powers throughout the war--- code breaking and daring military raids throughout the war were on-going affairs.The movie does not claim America was the first. In fact it dedicates the film to the British submarines who actual were. But American submariners did mount such attempts-- one which actually succeeding in 1944. AND, this is just a MOVIE! An American movie, for American audiences, with enough truth to have integrity, and enough glam and flash and theater to entertain the intended audience.",5,2,4,11 February 2002
"I, Robot"," Laughably unsuitable character for Will Smith. Fake & lame, but adequate TV-level entertainment
","Will Smith got an unfortunate rep a few years back as the 'King of Summer Blockbusters,' or the 'King of July,' or some such. It was entirely coincidental to his adequate talent that the summer release movies he was in happened to be blockbusters, and happened to make a ton of money. 'Independence Day' and 'Men in Black' were great, and loads of fun. Let's be honest, though--- they would have worked equally well with or without Will Smith. That's not to say he isn't charming. He does, indeed, have a kind of talent. But to saddle him, at that time a green and novice actor, with somehow having the 'magic touch' turning ordinary fare into blockbuster magic was unfair. It raised the expectations of his abilities far beyond reality, and far beyond his ability to actually deliver.'I, Robot' is just OK. The robots and the general sci-fi environment were, at all, times, laden with the paper-thin, two-dimensional vibe of a dim CARTOON!!! There were a few bright spots, such as the tunnel scene where the giant robot-hauling vans overtook Smith's cartoonmobile. But his acting job here, trying in vain to capture the cliche of the ironic, world-weary, been-everywhere, seen-it-all street cop, was so fake and unsuited to Smith that it was almost entertaining for its laughability.So, see 'I, Robot,' if at all, with a attitude expecting light, superficial, quickly forgettable 'TV' quality fare. I gave it 5 out of 10, and that was fair and generous.",5,0,0,9 August 2004
American Beauty," Some Oscar acting, but a thin, incomplete, cliche of a movie overall
","Give Kevin Spacey his Oscar now, to avoid congestion next February and March. The directing and writing, though is a little more suspect. Something rang false in the set-up of the story, and the way the movie brought itself to the conclusion. But what, exactly??? I honestly don't pretend to know, but I'll make a guess.Some of 'American Beauty' is great. But there the family and the neighbors and the workplaces were 'stock' elements from a recently emerged indie/reality/'Oh my God how daring' kind of movie making. Ten years ago they might have been revelations-- today they are cartoons of gut-spilling (as in spiritual and emotional exploration, etc.).What was the point of much of it? And NOT in the academic sense, but rather to me as an audience member? My buttons were not pushed by most of the movie. Oh sure, 'She was nasty,' and 'Gosh, that's quirky/interesting/arty, etc.' But other than occasional voyeurism or revulsion, my own personal and actual emotional buttons were not pushed. Nothing meaningful in me was addressed-- again, not in some easily definable intellectual sense, but in a visceral, emotional way.The director was taking the obligatory 'chances' with the material, but very much like Spacey's character in the shower scene. The movie felt more like the Sunday afternoon ruminations of a stoned, self-indulgent, and frustrated young artist just getting over his first divorce than any kind of real mirror held up to the world.The kid's sullen, the husband's a suppressed loser, the wife's become a hardened, dried out bitch. Duh. We've been churning that plot around and around since Rod Stieger's 1967 'The Pawnbroker.' And these days that is such a cliche and such a common TV set-up that it is only unusual when a theatrical family ISN'T that way. And again, to what purpose? What's new here? Or even, what of what's here is being shown in a new way, or even a full and thorough way?A lot is missing from this movie that I needed for it to have been personally meaningful. Oh yeah-- there were lots of great naked scenes, and a pretty effect or two with the rose petals (and for any Europeans or whatever not knowing this, American Beauty is the real, and well known name of the kind of rose depicted in the scenes. Such a clever, clever, clever play on words: Oh my God, the Art! Quick, somebody get my beret.)American Beauty is like the emperor in the kids' story: The dishonest tailors utilize millions of dollars worth of the emperor's jewels and gold to make him a new set of robes. They steal the money, of course, but to hide their crime they tell the emperor, and his toadies at court, that the new clothes can only be seen be wise people. The emperor, not wanting to appear out of the loop, walks through town naked, pretending to be dressed in fine duds that he, of course, can see. Everyone is buzzing and applauding the emperor's new clothes, not wanting to appear unwise and uncool themselves. Finally an innocent little kid shouts out-- 'Hey! The emperor has no clothes on. He's naked!' Then everyone wises up and sees the scene for what it is-- a naked guy who foolishly vaingloriously spent millions of dollars getting that way.This movie, I think, might be naked. Or at least walking around in its underwear. But Kevin Spacey-- man, what a tremendous job! And the others-- good, too, but without a full movie to act in, their efforts are somewhat wasted. I gave it a '6.'",9,0,0,9 October 1999
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Goofy and wonderful! Hilarious for adults!
","After seeing everything else at our rather slow moving and small multi-plex, I steeled myself for a dreadful 90 minutes in a cutsie-dootsie kiddies movie. Wrong! Despite the presence of two dozen toddlers in the auditorium (with their families, obviously), this was HILARIOUS! It was as adult, and bright, and funny, as any of the Shrek movies. Maybe Chris Rock playing a herd of zebras in this reminded me of Eddie Murphy in the Shreks (?). Truthfully, Madagascar 3 was that good.I suppose one doesn't have to be a genius to write one-liners and story lines that operate on two levels--- the kids' level, and the parents who brought them to the show. But maybe these writers are geniuses, I don't know. They certainly wrote some surprisingly sharp, witty, and adult jokes for the grown up portion of the audience. I have no idea what the toddlers experienced--- but in the time my showing was on, I never heard any crying, squawking, nor running up and down the aisles. Over the course of the 100-odd minutes (with trailers and whatnot) there were 5 or 6 dashes to the loo by a parent carrying or leading some youngster. Otherwise, no disturnbaces at all. The little ones seemed content.All of us in the audience roared with laughter OFTEN. That was both a surprise, as I said, and of course a delight.",10,2,6,12 November 2008
The Patriot," Historical quibbles aside-- a wonderful, and mostly accurate, historical movie!
","A lot of TV time has been given to historians and other scholars criticing this movie, a bit, for some of its 'factual' lapses. Benjamin Martin, the Mel Gibson character, was really Somebody Else Martin-- an actual historical figure of that time known as the 'Swamp Fox.' Kicked a lot of English butt, and was a hero of his generation. As mores and values change over time, dramatic devices and details must also change to evoke the same feelings in the audiences of future generations.That is, what might have thrilled the 18th and 19th century Americans to hero worship might now merely bore or even appall. Thus a few 'facts' must be changed for dramatic purposes-- Martin is now NOT a slave holder, was goaded by personal tragedy inflicted  by the English, etc. But this does represent, perhaps, the same feelings. Thus, while the facts of the history might be a little bit different here and there, the realities for the people actually involved, their feelings, and thus the real lives of those depicted, is in reality very true, and very correct. This might have been what the author of the book this was based on meant when he said recently: 'I don't let the facts get in the way of the truth' (or something close to that).From a Hollywood standpoint-- a good movie or not, etc., this is top notch entertainment. And all the hub-bub over facts notwithstanding, much of the period was actually displayed quite accurately-- the movie was shot in the same locales as many of the events of 1776-1781. The uniforms, guns, and tactics of the opposing sides were also accurately shown-- much of the technical expertise coming from historians and 're-enactors,' folks who devote years of their lives to reproducing the military look and behaviors of historical periods.In case some people wonder about Mel Gibson playing an early American patriot in the movie-- is there anyone left who doesn't yet know that Gibson was born and raised in the good ol' USA? He only went to high school and college in Australia, consciously learning and adopting an Australian accent to avoid being beaten by his teenaged Australian hosts. Upon returning to America, his accent has been flushed away, leaving his original New York state American standard inflection.You might see a bit of 'Braveheart' in some of the action. Hey-- when all is said and done, this IS a movie. I am curious about one thing-- Do the English allow Mel Gibson movies to be shown unedited in their country? Just wondering, given the rather unflattering portrayals of them Gibson has brought to the screen. I gave this flick a 10 out of 10. Go see it, you'll love it!",10,1,5,1 July 2000
Spider-Man," Well cast-- Kirsten Dunst and Toby McGuire are very good. 'Batmanish' overkill present, but kept to a minimum
","How could anyone resist the charms of sweet little Kirsten Dunst? Although she's now 6-foot eight, and is 47 years old. No wait--- she's still young, and a delightful actor. Her dramatic work in 'Crazy/Beautiful,' as well as her extensive and marvelous comedy work prior to that ('Drop Dead Gorgeous,' and 'Dick' are two under-appreciated modern classics)have proven her to be a major talent. She is definitely the Real Deal--- not just some poof-in-the-pan passing fad. In 'Spiderman' she does the obligatory 'Oooing' and 'aaahing' at the hero--- but funnily, she also brings a realness to her role that goes beyond what previous comic-book-movie actresses have done. She brings an innocence and an excitement to her on-screen behaviors that is disarming and engaging for the audience. Yaay Kirsten!Toby McGuire is well matched for the role--- 'Spiderman' comic have always been a bit on the underdog side. The movie is no exception. But I was very happy to see that this movie avoided (mostly) the bizarre and depressing 'dark side' vibe that somehow seduced the makers of the tedious and self-absorbed 'Batman,' the pretty good 'Mask,' and even the horrid 'Monkey Bone' (from an otherwise brilliant Brendan Fraser. What happened with THAT, dood?). Spidie's world seemed virtually normal, and the sci-fi overkill was only hinted at with Willem DeFoe's space-scooter thingy that could evidently run around the sky forever on a single, invisible, tank of gas.Over all, much more good hearted than previous movie-cartoons of comic books. WAY brighter, way better all around. Still not a masterpiece--- but entertaining enough.",6,0,0,3 May 2002
Collateral," Brilliant directing and acting. Cruise and Foxx proved themselves masters; the Oscar nom is well deserved!
","Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise both proved they are real, actual actors, and not mere 'celebrities' or cutsie poster boys. This movie is a tad dark, but it is very exciting. For me, there was never a moment where the violence seemed gratuitous. That is, there were many moments throughout the film where a 'typical' thriller action movie would have resorted to familiar clichÃ©s. Here, Jamie Foxx's character really seemed to react in the same way most of us would have as well. And Tom Cruise, cursed by overly cute looks, has always run the danger of being smarmy, but has avoided it for the most part. In this movie, that danger was never felt, nor ever sensed. For me, that proves that his acting and his portrayal was so solid, and so real, and so right on the money, that its genuineness and veracity were never in doubt.Overall, this movie is violent, although not gruesome. It is directed and acted with subtlety and finesse. It is worthy of Foxx's best supporting actor Oscar nomination--- although Cruise deserved one too. But hey, that's the way it goes, sometimes. Paul Giamati deserved one as well for 'Sideways', along with his nominated co-star, Thomas Hayden Church, but didn't get one this year. I gave this a 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,7 February 2005
The Fast and the Furious," Tons better than I'd heard-- An entertaining thrill ride!
","This was a pretty good movie. I'm not a car freak, but I do appreciate fine machinery. That's not enough for a movie I'd go see, however, so i was hesitant to watch 'The Fast and the Furious.' I did get the DVD, though, and am glad I did. Maybe my low expectations helped me to enjoy it-- I admit that I was pleasantly surprised. There are two heros-- the blond guy, and Vin Deisel. The blond guy was an annoying weasel and wuss for the first three fourths of the flick, and then I began to like him. The other hero is played by Deisel, an amazing actor. I'd seen him in 'Saving private Ryan,' but nothing else. This dood' screen presence is magnetic. He's got charisma as well as depth. My guess is we'll see Deisel become a solid and major star--- that is, if he chooses his roles and career moves rightly.",9,1,1,3 March 2002
Spirited Away," A stunning and lovely masterpiece! BUT the bad distribution and zero-promotion is a crime against movies.
","One of the things movies CAN do, and great movies ALWAYS do, is evoke: Dimensions, ways of being, feelings, thoughts, emotions, etc. Dimensions that are somehow 'above and beyond' our normal, everyday lives. 'Spirited Away' really does a great job of that. Any description I can imagine fails in capturing the essence of the movie. It is animated, but it is no cartoon. In fact, its essence, its life, its 'legs' are so much richer and closer to a truth of some kind than many conventional movies shot on film stock with more or less human actors. For example, 'Spirited Away,' in my opinion, is much more real and much more watchable than any Julia Roberts performance ever put on film. 'Spirited Away' is, in fact, a breath of fresh, vibrant air. OH MY GOD--- I sound like a film school graduate--- but it's true nonetheless.One very sad thing, however, is the lack of promotion and evident lack of care exhibited by the U.S. distributor--- Disney Studios, is it? I was eagerly awaiting a chance to see this movie, but when it finally did arrive there was zero advertising in my community, so I almost missed it. Some friends called me and said it was playing nearby and they asked if I wanted to see it on a Wednesday night. I said sure--- although I was a bit shocked that it had come to my town completely unannounced. Good thing we went that Wednesday (it had come to the theater just four days before, on the Friday), because it was gone in only two more days. WHAT??? A masterpiece like this only played for 7 days! And even sadder, the four of us sat in an almost empty theater during a 'prime time' screening. That is a crime against art. A crime against movies!!! I'm sure that if the movie had been advertised and promoted on TV, many, many people--- adults, families, kids--- of all kinds would have really enjoyed themselves at this flick. Buying the rights to it, and then ignoring it and even virtually burying it away like they've done is shabby treatment for a master-work, and very tacky. Does the entire corporate world treat innocent creativity and joyous movie making in this way?If you have any chance at all to see this movie (even a 4 hour drive would be worth it), please do yourself a favor and hie thee thither. It is more than amazing--- it is thoroughly entertaining, and most wonderful!",10,0,1,30 November 2002
Pearl Harbor," Awful! If this were a book, you'd read it in the bathroom and never tell a soul!
","Everyone probably has a different reason for hating this movie; and most likely, they're all correct. And yet, to be honest it also has some engaging aspects, and even a tiny number of good moments.First, the effects are good. Having seen literally hundreds of recreations of the Pearl Harbor attack over the past decades, what could they do that would dazzle or even inform the audience? Not much, I'm afraid. So the good effects don't really mean much. They are kind of wasted, because they are so humdrum. Although the flying bullets were scary.Second, the history is rudimentary. That's OK, but it does ignore a lot of real-life meaning. For example, the movie depicts Japanese Admiral Yamamoto, the inspiration and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, commenting on the bombing success. In the movie, he (as played by way-cool actor Mako) is merely a head-shot, evidently in the open air. He says, 'Perhaps we have merely awakened a sleeping giant.' Ok, that's historically recorded. What isn't depicted in the movie is context within which he is said to have made that remark. According to historian and author John Toland, the pilots, officers, and crew of the Japnaese aircraft carriers were wildly celebrating their victory at Pearl Harbor. Amidst the drinking, whooping-it-up,  and general Part-ay!!! vibe, the admiral refused to join in. His officers begged him to party with them, and he declined, saying, in effect, 'I lived in the United States, and have toured her industries extensively. You have NO idea how vast her power is. As successful as this raid was, I'm telling you we've only awakened a sleeping giant. Rather than partying right now, I suggest we get back to Japan as fast as we can, and start building as many airplanes and training as many pilots as possible. We're going to need them.' OK, so maybe that's close enough to the movie version, but in a 3-1/2 hour movie, don't you think a few seconds of character development time could have been devoted to the Japanese?Lastly, the soap opera vibe was hideous! Right from the first scene, the music score was loud, dramatic, syrupy sweet, with 'dramatic-climax' violins and female choral voices. Throughout the movie, the tone was mawkish, overly sentimental, and annoyingly corny. Many of the scenes, and story threads, were so ham-fisted and clumsy, it was just plain BAD!If 'Pearl Harbor' were a book, you'd read it in the bathroom, skip half it, hoot and laugh and the other half, and never reveal your dirty little secret to anyone!",1,0,1,26 May 2001
Batman Begins," A Welsh Batman? Crazy, but it works. Finally, a GREAT Batman movie!
","Hey--- a Welsh Batman? I never thought I'd be saying that. And he is, undeniably, the absolute best, as much as Keaton, Kilmer, and Clooney are fine actors in their own rights. I must confess that I hated the earlier Batman movies. Thus, I had no intention of seeing this one. However, a few critics' thoughtful analyses won me over, at least for a 'look see'. I am grateful that I took the chance.Part of what made the earlier Batman movies so awful, and so depressing, and so cartoonish, was the completely bummer and downer environment. Gotham City was soooo evil. Life was lost, hope was gone, etc. The villains could never really be stopped, elsewise why would they keep coming back every issue of the comics, every week on the TV, and each sequel of the movie?This new movie is completely different. It's not about the stars. It's not about the effects. It's about a man, and human issues that to some degree we can all understand and appreciate, even if we don't, maybe, completely identify.Anyway--- very entertaining, very un-cartoony, very exiting and 'real', in a weird movie-world way. I gave this an astounding and well-deserved 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,17 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Better than the original--- this one is a true love story, with warmth, charm, and wit
","Great sequel---I didn't care for the original very much. It was too negative, too many of the 'jokes' revolved around frustration, mishaps, and pain. Not my scene! But this second one was VERY good! I was especially surprised, and pleasantly, by Barbara Streisand's performance. I actually liked her. A LOT. The rest of the cast was outstanding as well. 'Meet the Fockers' had lots of jokes, but wasn't the 'madcap' zany freak-fest the first tried (and failed, ultimately) to be. This was more of a sustained wit. It also has charm, grace, and warmth. I found that surprising, because it is marketed (at least here in the UK) more as a slapstick job.It is not too much to say that this movie was actually somewhat of a love story--- and for the first time, I could actually see what the various characters might be seeing in each other. I was charmed, delighted, and completely won over. Good show!",9,8,17,28 January 2005
The Pianist," Scary parallels to present Iraqi war. Adrien Brody is jaw-droppingly amazing!
","I just saw 'The Pianist' at my local theater. It is Saturday, and the British and American armies and air forces are in day four of their invasion of Iraq. I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the German invasion of Poland in the movie, and events just now unfolding. In 1939 the Germans had their own 'documented' grievances against the 'aggressive' Poles. Later it was revealed that the dead German bodies produced for the German newsreel footage justifying their invasion of Poland were just some corpses the Nazis rounded up, and dressed in German and Polish uniforms. Point to make is that 69% of the Germans--- otherwise law abiding, Christian, decent people, probably felt the same grim determination modern day American and British peoples feel toward Iraq. No one is cheering the deaths, but they are nonetheless sanctioning them, in the name of some political agenda. Saddam as Hitler? Yes--- but Bush and Blair as Hitlers, too? Sadly, it seems so. 'The Pianist' gives a human face to the real victims--- and I am fearful that many innocent Iraqis may get a double dose of what this movie points out--- first from their own government, and now again from ours.'The Pianist' portrays the fate of Polish Jews during world war two. The movie is a true masterpiece, surpassing most other movies that have undertaken the story. I attended the movie reluctantly--- I did not feel like sitting through another retread of the same old theme, and the same old victims and villains. Great reviews tempted me, however, and I am glad I went. Adrien Brody, the star of the movie, is amazing. His performance was breathtaking. Really. I hope he wins his Oscar Sunday night. By the end of the movie I was in absolute admiration and awe. He is jaw-droppingly good.",10,1,2,22 March 2003
P.S. I Love You," Strained to NOT be sentimental, but the clumsy attempt at 'realism' was unconvincing. Should have just followed the genre. Overall, was good though
","'P.S. I Love You' deals with the trickiest of movie subjects. Think about it. It COULD be complete treacle, and nothing but cheesy sentimentality. Overall, though, while the movie has its flaws, and is a BIT soppy in parts, it actually does a decent job.Where it did well, in my view, was in its portrayal of the relationship between the main characters, Holly and Gerry. It is no secret that Gerry dies (it's in every trailer and poster), and Holly is faced with having to cope, whilst moving on. The clever bit is that while his health was fading, and he knew he would die soon, Gerry arranged for a series of communiques and other messages to surprise, delight, and inspire the woman he knew would soon be his widow.All of that is plausible enough. Hey, it's a MOVIE, for goodness' sake, and this plot is not any more implausible than any other fiction.I found myself actually believing and enjoying the first third of the movie, then. I LIKED Gerry, and I 'bought' Holly and Gerry's marriage. Where it fell apart a bit for me was the middle third, where Holly dealt with her friends. These three or four women were some of the dumbest, most annoying characters I have seen this year. What slags! Selfish, short-sighted, and shallow, every one of them.The final third was almost as frustrating, although things ended on a better note. However, it was painfully obvious that the director was straining overly to avoid any 'pat' or too happy an ending. As if he was afraid of his genre, and was desperate to appear 'realistic' or something. The movie's forced sense of nonchalance was strained, and was worse than if it had just given in and given the main female character the happy ending the genre demanded, and we were all expecting.Life DOES work out for people very often! People DO find happiness. There is nothing wrong with a bit of cinematic 'happy ending for all' from time to time. It would have been more honest, easier to film, and more satisfying to watch.But, overall, not bad. Maybe because I'm a bloke I missed some subtlety or nuance? Maybe women will be more appreciative? Dunno... I thought the girl-gang was lame, and the false 'non-sentiment' was unconvincing. But truthfully, I DID enjoy, mostly, the movie, and gave it a 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,22 December 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Jackson remains a genius, and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein, and a fantastic movie!
","I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's 'original' manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very 'literary' Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!Therefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many 'festive' people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.Maybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the 'literary' vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series.  Oh well--- if wishing were having...Overall, 'LOTR Two Towers' is an excellent movie! A '10' out of '10'!!!",10,38,50,18 December 2002
Cars 2," Dazzling and charming!
","I knew I would like this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing I found it. As a hold-out and a bit of a cranky git, I confess I am one of those who find the 3D experience an annoyance. Maybe if they someday come up with a contraption-free (no glasses) way to see it, I might like it. My cinema only had it in 3D. Drat.However, the 3D annoying gimmick aside- I was thrilled by the lush beauty of this movie. I was also gratified by the depth and meaningful quality of the story. Recounting the plot here would not accomplish anything, so I'll skip it. Let us say that if the outcomes of all the plot points were probably predictable, that's OK--- As a 'comedy' that is the formula- and it was well served.I was entranced throughout.Emily Mortimer's solid feminine sweetness and likability came through- and Michael Cain was a hoot. And the skillful comedic actor Eddie Izzard's characterisation was also true to his particular form. The cast from the first Cars film all seemed to be here as well- to good effect.I will note that this did not seem like a film made for small children at all. My auditorium was filled with the little guys- a cute and amiable crew, to be sure. But I cannot imagine that they would find the characters and the intricate story intelligible. And the jaw-droppingly beautiful scenery and artwork would also likely be lost on them.I loved this movie!",10,28,39,26 June 2011
Coyote Ugly," Familiar story still has great energy, and works for me!!!
","Not bad, not bad. I read reviews that criticized the cliche-ness of this movie, and I can see their point. At times the plot made the characters a little bit annoying. But hey-- story cliches often become that way because they speak to universal 'truths,' or at least things that interest bunches of people over of time.This movie is interesting-- it is engaging, and even touching at times. I DID care about the characters throughout the story. I wanted to see how things would work out for them, and I wanted them to win. Sure, the plot is kind of predictable-- but the energy kept the theme in the forefront, and I AM interested in the theme presented here-- love, taking risks, courage, and all of that. The women actors were wonderful-- hot, sure, but also outrageous in an innocent kind of way. I had the sense that none of the characters in the movie, even the raunchy extras in the bar scenes, was belittled. I suspected the writers, director, cast, etc., had a basic affection for their subjects and topic.The dancing was great-- I noted 'dancing doubles' in the credits for all of the girls-- and the bar tricks and stunts were fun. I enjoyed pretending that those stunts were even possible, and that they wouldn't have killed 7 people the first night they were tried in a real bar in real life. I gave this one an '8' out of 10. Go see it-- you'll like it!",8,31,41,5 August 2000
Men in Black II," Good-- not great-- but at least it's an 'honest' sequel!!!
","I LOVED the original, and found this sequel much less brilliant, but still a decent movie. Some good critics have slammed it for not being a work of originality and genius, but that is unfair. True, sequels, by definition, must be taken along with the first movie that inspired them, and put in the overall context. But, can't sequels also be judged, at least somewhat, as movies in their own right?Given the 'entire franchise' context, and the 'stand alone' criterion, 'Men in Black II' has its moments, but clearly isn't as good as 'MIB.' One nice thing to say in its favor, though, is the evident fact that the director and producers did NOT populate the second movie with 50,000 more aliens, puppets, and cartoons, as so often happens in sequels. That showed a bit of restraint. Also, the plot didn't 'undo' all the achievements of the characters and the story in the original. That is, whatever we as the audience might have enjoyed in the make-believe world of the first movie remains intact. Note the difference in some franchises, where virtually ALL of the gains, wins, achievements, etc. obtained by the characters in the original are essentially wiped out, nullified by some lame-brained Hollywood Suit who can only see the dollar signs of the sequels. 'Back to the Future' comes to mind--- a brilliant, sweet, and innocently spiritual movie wherein characters changed their destinies and overcame fear, limitations, etc.--- only to have all of that completely undone in the opening frames of the second movie.'MIB II' at least takes up where the first one left off--- (although I'd have loved to have seen the gorgeous and interesting Linda Fiorintino return as agent 'L.')---and that alone is worth high praise, given the crap that 'summer blockbuster' movie producers often deliver via sequels. 'MIB II' is true to the theme, although not very well done. It is a bit dim, a bit shoddy-- but at least it is an honest sequel! And that is, indeed, cause for praise and admiration.Bottom line: decent. Not bad. 'B-,' or a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,5 July 2002
Children of Men," If Stanley Kubrick were alive today, and 32 years old, HE would have made this movie!
","There is a strong political element to this movie. Do note, also, that the director is from a third world country (Mexico). In one sense the general vibe of the film is similar to the great, recent, 'V for Vendetta'. It is kind of a portrayal of Britishness gone completely off the charts--- although the world politics depicted here are not exclusive to the UK by any means. Whatever your personal politics, however, you absolutely must give this movie credit: it is exciting, rich, detailed, and thrilling. Certainly solid entertainment. If you get any kind of 'message' out of it, then that's your bonus.'Children of Men' is not perfect--- but it is so good that it doesn't matter. Clive Owen & Julianne Moore give believable, outstanding performances. The supporting cast was also up to the task.I was reminded as well of early Kubrick work. Thematically, that would especially be 'A Clockwork Orange'. Directorially, that would be 'Full Metal Jacket'. And such circa 1970 fare by other filmmakers such as the wrongly-forgotten 'O Lucky Man'. If Stanley Kubrick were alive today, and 32 or so years old, HE would have made this movie! I gave this 10 out of 10.",10,6,13,7 October 2006
Million Dollar Baby," A masterpiece! Stunning Grace and Love from cranky old coot Clint Eastwood. A miracle!
","This is truly an amazing film. I'd read that it was a masterpiece. That can be an ominous sign, however. You know, one of those dim, fuzzy, dark and depressing movies that critics shove down our throats because watching them will somehow make us more spiritual. Like a 'Watch it and shut up. It's good for you' kind of thing. This was completely different, and wonderfully so. I loved this movie, and so will you.'Million Dollar baby' IS a masterpiece, but thank God it is also NOT dim or down, and at no moment whatsoever was it in the least 'arty' or 'significant' at all. It is an amazing work of stunning grace and power. It is radiant with Life,Love--- and a shockingly high level of genuine humanity. And to think all of this came from that cranky old coot Clint Eastwood! Sorry,Clint, but you have shown your heart, and your vision, and it is immense. Too late! You will forever be known as a master artist, and a first class human being. I gave this a 10 out of 10, because 'these don't go to eleven'.",10,1,3,14 January 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Important, well-crafted. Wouldn't have worked 10 years ago, but hey, it wasn't needed then either
","I really liked this movie. It's black and white, which I hate. It's kind of heavy, and it deals with sad political realities. Even so, it is an important movie. It is extremely well written and well crafted.I always had a personal 'connection' with Edward R. Murrow. I never knew him--- I'm way too young, and not at all important--- but I got a master's degree from the Edward R. Murrow School of Communication at Washington State University, which was Murrow's alma mater as well. We were steeped in his history, and his culture. I feel a bit proud of our 'hometown hero'.More, though, Murrow stood for an integrity and honesty in journalism that is virtually extinct today. He gave a speech in 1962 or so where he spoke to an audience of broadcasters in Washington D.C., noting with genuine horror that commercial adverts were now appearing adjacent to news broadcasts. He spoke of a foreboding future when he remarked to that crowd, 'It's not too outrageous to imagine a day in the future when there might actually be advertising WITHIN a news broadcast'. He was right, of course, much to the sorrow of the modern world.This movie captures the 'Ed' spirit very well. The production of the film has obvious political motives. George W. Bush is clearly portrayed by the stupid yet cunning, selfish, self-aggrandising, greedy and all-around evil Joseph McCarthy. Sadly, the resemblance is spot on. The movie pulls in archival film of folks in the day, Murrow, of course, and even President Dwight D. Eisenhower to point up the short-sightedness and tawdry vibe of the McCarthtry/Bush style of politics. Eisenhower, who also warned America and the world of the growing threat of the power of the 'military industrial complex', is shown supporting the Murrow approach. It is not a stretch to imagine that Eisenhower, even though he was a Republican, and a military general, would be horrifed at George W. Bush, and the current administration.All together, it is an important movie, and a splendid movie. It probably wouldn't have gotten the attention it has if it were made, say, 10 years ago. But then, it wasn't needed then.",10,3,5,18 February 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Adequately charming and entertaining. True to the dark and creepy book by the dark and creepy Roald Dahl
","I liked the original, even though the 'special effects' of that one were lame, even by the funky FX standards of the early 1970s. This second one was better in some respects, not as charming in others. The first had heart, however contrived it may have been. But do remember that with the era of the first one, none other than the ancient, albeit venerable, Sammy Davis Jr., famous lounge singer from the 1890s, seemed the appropriate choice to snatch the 1st movie's theme song (Candyman) and make it his own signature tune. Anyway--- that just shows how old and fusty the first one was.The second one, this movie, is a lot truer to the original Roald Dahl book. But hey, as much as the unwashed masses are keen to admire the 'emperor's new clothes', that is, to praise Dahl as a genius of kid books, Dahl is, to be honest, a very dark creepy writer. In my humble opinion, I question whether his books are even suitable for children. After having read his actual books, and not just having seen movies based on his books, I myself would not allow any child over whom I had responsibility or influence to read them. They are mean-spirited, ugly, and really, kind of disgusting.Having said that, the marvelous and always amazing Johnny Depp did a good job. The kids were great, and Helena Bonhan Carter was a brave trooper to sport real 'Englishy-looking' teeth as the poor mother. It was also nice to see Missy Pyle, the hottie alien from the great 'Galaxy Quest', begin to emerge from what had begun to look like permanent third-banana character actor status.Given the dreary and disturbingly creepy book source, this movie was adequately entertaining. TAKE your kids, though-- and be prepared to talk with them and comfort them as needed. Do not just send them in to the theater alone.",7,0,1,29 July 2005
For Love of the Game," It is slow, but it's also depressing!
","Good news and bad news... First the bad news: I went to see 'For the Love of the Game.' The good news: I got up and left after 20 minutes, and the theater management refunded my money. Yes!!! I'd mention the name of the Santa Barbara theater chain that operates the Goleta movie theater I went to, in order to compliment them, but we're supposed to avoid commercial mentions here. Well OK then.Doesn't Kevin Costner-- who is supremely talented and can be marvelous on-screen-- have any friends? You know, honest, loving, committed people who will tell him the truth about the movies he does? Kevin, dood, forget your 'star power' (while you still have it), and get some real, down-and-dirty, from the heart, tell it like it is, advice and direction. It could come from a creative director, an artist, or even someone not in the movie biz. But find SOMEBODY, my brother. You could be making masterpieces instead of this dross.",1,3,9,13 October 1999
Friends with Benefits," Deft and engaging. Brilliant cast delivers the perfect tone. I loved this movie!
","Very pleasant surprise! I enjoyed this film. I knew I was heading into a rom-com, of course. Often rom-coms have at least some major element of what I can only call 'the stupid'. Maybe a supporting character is so lame or even unsavoury that it detracts from the overall integrity of the movie. Or perhaps, in some cases, the plot hinges on events that aren't even just theatrical (after all, all films are 'fake' and theatrical), but so contrived and removed from life as to be just plain silly. Or stupid.The only criticism of the movie I have, and it is a minor quibble, I guess--- I never understood what the Shaun White character was doing in the movie. Minor spoiler: I kept waiting for him to be a catalyst for something, but all the writers had him do was act yobbish and odious. Shaun White is a lovely and admirable man in real life- so what was the object of his 'fictional' appearance in this film? Dunno... Maybe it was funnier or more interesting on paper? But aside from that odd bit of character insertion, everything else was pitch perfect.This movie felt solid and real all the way down to every character, each scene, and right up to the end. Please understand I am granting a 'theatre' realism to it, not a 'how my actual life goes' realism. But isn't it just so that we have some stories we tell ourselves, both for solace for our disappointments, and for inspiration and maybe even guidance for how we'd like to live our lives? In that latter case we'd call the stories 'inspirational'.'Friends With Benefits' was also like that latter case. it is a fantasy, to be sure. We aren't meant to take it as a documentary. But there are many levels of greatness amongst stories and fantasies, and this movie had th best quality of art. It was the best kind of fantasy- it spoke to me on deep and true levels, it uplifted me and yes, as clichÃ© and hippie as it may sound, it also inspired me.The actors were perfectly cast. I've always liked Mila Kunis- but here she shows up as a powerful actor with a wonderful playful nature that wins her friends in any audience. Justine Timberlake- I must confess I always kind of thought he was a poser, producing music that pretended to be 'all street' and whatnot. But i was proved wrong here, and am glad of it. he was sympathetic and engaging. Both the leads were people I could identify with, and cheer on.Patricia Clarkson was pitch-perfect. her role as the wacky mother could easily have turned into a cringe-worthy cartoon of 'an old drunk broad' who still lives in her salad days, in lesser hands. Clarkson was human and warm and likable- a master acting job, and a master class in the deft touch with perfect tone.Jenna Elfman was also a pleasant surprise--- I remember her well from the likable TV fluff 'Dharma and Greg', and a few roles in the likes of the Edward Norton directorial movie 10 years or so ago. Kind of 'sharp,' then. here she seems to have matured into a very likable and strong woman. Her character felt sensible, essential to the story, and loving. That was very nice to see.Overall, every character appeared for just right amount of time. No character over-stayed their welcome or purpose. Even keeping the adorable and amazing Emma Stone down to just a few too-brief scenes was, in the end, probably a smart move on the director's part. Any more would have been distracting. It was all just right!",10,2,10,24 July 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Entertaining AND a masterpiece. Wow! What a great combination...
","Typically, movies dealing with human consciousness (in the woo-woo, metaphysical sense), even when very well done, scare the pants off of most critics. Something about deep emotion, intuition, or anything new and 'personal' in that sense will usually elicit cries of 'Witch! Witch!' from most critics. How come this movie was universally beloved? Dunno... Whatever the reason, the critics seem to have got it right, and in this case, I agree with them 100%. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is brave, thoughtful. meaningful, and best of all, exceptionally well done. It is, truly, a masterpiece.Truly an extra-ordinary movie! Any conceivable description of it would be a disservice. Thus, don't try to imagine what the movie is about, or even whether or not you'll like it. Trust the critics and the vast public ravings on this one--- 'Eternal Sunshine...' is GREAT!!!",10,0,1,17 June 2004
The Mummy Returns," Silly, exciting, illogical, stupid, grand, and entertaining!
","Don't expect high art, or even simple logic, for that matter. But DOexpect to enjoy the action and to be entertained. The effects areamazing (and whose wouldn't be with 'lebenty billion dollars tospend?). The effects also are unusual. It's something thoughtprovoking to watch, like the acid induced light shows andotherwise 'meaningless' film experiments of the late 1960s. It's atrip! And in this way, it is arty, in that it allows one to imagine andexperience realities (albeit fake movie realities) not otherwiseavailable. Maybe this is a nice actualization of a dream timeexperience.Anyway-- the cast is great. The Scotch guy plays an annoyingcharacter, but all the other characters are either intriguing, or sexy,or spooky, or all three. The showing I attended was 98% doods-- afew boys, some with dads or older brothers, tons of college aged,20s and 30s, and even a pile of gray haired men. There were only5 or 6 females present in the entire (new and fancy) theater. I'm notsure what that means, but I know my female roommate refused togo, or even hear about it later.If you're a guy, maybe you should just take some fellows along;don't strain the relationship by trying to educate your partner. Ifyou're a female-- what the heck: Live dangerously, and give thisguy flick a try. You might love it too. At least you'd have a glimpse ofyour boyfriends', husbands', and brothers' ideal fun movie!",8,1,1,4 May 2001
Toy Story 2," Excellent movie alone or as a sequel to the original-- A rare thing!
","This rare sequel is a great movie unto itself. That is so uncommon with sequels, it should get an Oscar in a new, special category-- just for being as good as the original. Moreover, it intelligently portrayed the characters and the movie's 'world' in a truly sequence fashion. That is, in a plausible universe where situations develop and grow, 'Toy Story 2' actually shows what one might expect a few months later (from the supposed time of of events in 'Toy Story,' the first movie).So often sequels smell like desperate movie business deals-- adding in ridiculous and artificial complications and dangers, and emphasizing 'shtick' that the producers think the audience loved about the original. This shtick-- tag lines and quirky mannerisms-- then become fodder for billions of fast-food drink cups, and endless TV commercials that grind every last bit of potential pleasure that might have been gleaned from the movie into the dirt and dust. So often, a sequel only manages to undo the pedigree of the original.Not so here--  'Toy Story 2' is a great movie, with or without the first; yet it also adds value and enjoyment to the first film. In the future (a 'Toy Story 3'?), the two flicks will definitely become a treasured boxed set of DVD's, to be seen and enjoyed together. I gave this a '10.'",10,0,1,28 November 1999
Super 8," I was loving it before it opened, then my fond wishes dashed- crap movie!
","I was really expecting something much better than this. I read respected reviewers all ooo-ahhh-ing about the Spielberg touch and the old-school Hollywood 80s magic making a comeback here. I must say I saw none of that.What I saw was dim, clumsy, and amateurish. The characters were unappealing. Of the 'corps de kids,' so to speak, I wouldn't have minded terribly if ALL of them got hit by a bus and disappeared, they were so unpleasant and whiny. The only exception I can remember is the kid called 'Joe.' While the others are played by youthful actors who are without doubt fine young people, the characters they portrayed, the behaviors the adults in charge of production demanded that they engage in, were unattractive.I was SO on this film's side! I was cheering it on, willing to make all kinds of allowances in order to support its artistic flair. Truth is, this film seemed to be about on the primitive level of an early 1960s kids' TV show. I needn't have worried about the flair- there was none.The deliberate attempt to bring on a Spielberg vibe was ham-fisted, clumsy, and embarrassingly obvious at all times. There were passages in the movie where various Spielberg shticks were imitated, especially places where there was frenetic camera action and lots of Voice Over. For example in one puzzling 20-minute stretch the kid actors in this movie were sounding EXACTLY like the pint-sized crew from The Goonies, even the two 'fat kid' characters from the two movies were in sync.I don't ask sci-fi or fantasy to make sense outside of its own world. But there is a degree of internal logic, or artistic coherence, that is a minimum requirement for a human being to even follow the story and make sense of it. This movie lacked such a minimum.I am not angry at all- I am more disappointed and puzzled by this movie's poor quality than anything else. Seriously- it is BAD.",2,16,47,11 June 2011
The Da Vinci Code," Delightful thriller. Minor logic 'problems', but belief stuff aside, this is a brilliant and rousing chunk of movie magic and movie fun!
","The spiritual 'truths' of 'The Da Vinci Code' are not the point. What does seem more important, and worthy of our consideration vis-a-vis the movie, is the phenomenon whereby whenever something powerfully new is in the offing, and then the old-school die-hards resist it. It seems to be a story about how humans will do virtually any evil thing to protect their ego's stand on whatever topic is at hand.This movie is not anti-Catholic. The so-called 'codes' and secret societies depicted in the movie are illogical, and pure hooey, in my opinion. I personally think that whole aspect is silly. I have read the book, and thought it was all pretty silly then, too. Upon seeing the movie, I was not convinced otherwise.Having a world-wide religion broaden its base, and begin to appeal to the feminine, to the Universal Mother principle, is undoubtedly a very good thing. Perhaps some version of this, minus the hokem and hooey of Dan Brown's book, of course, is in fact The Next Big Step for mankind.That aside, the movie itself is extremely well made. It is very effective, well acted, and an exciting way to spend an afternoon or an evening. I heard some homegrown English critics on BBC Radio 4 this past Friday, reviewing it. One woman said she was gratified that the British actors acquitted themselves admirably, especially contrasted to the timid and hesitant character played by Tom Hanks. As much as her pride in the British actors was well-placed, her panning and criticising of Tom Hanks was unfounded, and grossly unfair. The character he was portraying WAS a timid and hesitant character. He played an academic who was swept up in a storm of mistaken identities and mistaken guilts and purposes. This is called 'act-ing', and is what a great actor such as Hanks excels at doing. I thought Hanks did a fabulous job of being someone--- an intelligent, well educated, and basically good and wholesome someone--- who got caught in events way beyond his control, that he neither understood nor could control. Audrey Tatou (Sp?), the French actress who played the other main character, also did a wonderful job. It was refreshing first to hear her speak English (because I speak English, of course). Second, it was nice to see her play a 'real' person this time, rather than the simpering fluffs she played in 'Amelie' and another role I cannot remember the name of just now.Ian McKellan was amazing, as usual. Isn't funny that it now seems that he is in HALF the movies coming out of Hollywood these days? He deserves the success, as he is a great and sturdy actor. Paul Bettany, also in director Ron Howard's previous film, 'A Beautiful Mind', was great, as was Alfred Molina--- who continues to defy categorization as to his nationality. Funny, the BBC 4 Brit-praising critic did not mention him! Molina is such a chamelion--- another great actor. He is a native Londoner, and his generic Euro-Dark looks allow him to repeatedly play Frenchmen, Spaniards, Italians, or whomever else the script (and subsequent paycheck!!!) calls for.The cast--- superb all around. Marvelous! So, forget the churchy stuff, or not, as you will. But do leave your logical brain at the door, and you'll have a wonderful time at the movies with 'The Da Vinci Code'.",9,3,5,21 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," 'Matrix OVER-loaded' Desperately straining to match the original, it tries to cram in way too much psuedo-profundity
","As a 'stand-alone' action movie 'Matrix 2' ain't bad. It's technically clever and inventive. As a sequel to 'The Matrix,' however, it falls quite short. The first 'Matrix' dazzled audiences with its special FX, to be sure. But more than that, I believe it conveyed a model of human breakthrough that inspired people consciously, and on unconscious levels. Whatever it was, SOMETHING about the first 'Matrix' movie captured people's imaginations on a level much deeper and more profound that mere special effects wizardry.'Matrix Reloaded' was very obviously under tremendous pressure to duplicate and advance that earlier success--- both in the technical crafting of the film, and the transcendental vibe that sparked out from the first movie. This 'Matrix Reloaded' script strains to be 'heavy,' and strains to over-load with fluffy philosophy, profundity, and meaning. It tries desperately, and that vain, panting effort in the script is evident. It tries too hard. To quote the recent movie 'Super Troopers,' 'Desperation is a stinky cologne.'Funny thing--- if there was no 'The Matrix,' this flick would probably be a 9 or 10. But because it is a sequel, comparisons are invited, in fact, comparisons are demanded--- and 'The Matrix Reloaded' falls way short. I give it a generous 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,15 May 2003
The Fountain," Bold try... but ultimately rubbish. A tedious hash of a whinger with OCD
","I hesitate to criticise someone else's spiritual beliefs--- but I get the feeling that this movie was not about spiritual beliefs so much as crazed attachment. The hero can't let go of his wife. Does that echo the romantic attempts and psychological profiles of the director or the writer? Dunno. But the sentiment is very Rob McCuen, Leonard Nimoy-ish, for those of you who may have come across those two writers' attempts at love poetry and such in the late 1960s (Nimoy, famous as Spock in Star Trek, also wrote a very gooey romance novel). Maudlin to the point of mawkish.Just so you're clear, I LIKE metaphysical movies. And I like boldness in movie making. For that, the director gets kudos. But the pay-off was really bad. The hero displayed a narcissistic OCD that was meant to be endearing and inspiring and loving--- but just came off as creepy, indulgent, and well--- just plain crazy. As a result, most of his histrionics were annoying, rather than moving. He was, by turns, always shouting, throwing things, slamming things, or crying.But Hey--- what about that Rachel Weisz? is she HOT or what? The movie is almost worth the time just to see her for a couple of hours. But even so, better just go and rent 'The Mummy' and be satisfied with that.If you're a seeker--- well, you won't find it here. If you're a romance fancier--- same deal--- nothing here. The FX were nice, and the monkey had character, but that's about it. Save your time and your dough, and do something else. I gave this a 6 out of 10 because of Rachel, the FX, and the monkey, and at least the movie tried. Otherwise, to have been unnecessarily cruel, it was more of a 3.",6,0,4,27 January 2007
Enemy at the Gates," Atmosphere, plus important entertainment!
","True, this movie is heavy on atmosphere, but isn't that at least one of the points great art can strive for? Many critics have said the love story was an awkward 'add on' affair. I disagree. 'Stalingrad,' the town and the battle, has always been a mere name to me. And a drab one at that. This movie is rich in vibes, rich in humanity. Maybe it would have been strange to portray Stalingrad as a corny love story if wee knew anything about the place or the times. As it is, this movie, love twists and all, is the first and only human slant on the Russians and the history that I have ever seen. Plus, in addition to all that good civic-duty stuff, it's a well made, entertaining, and exciting movie to boot! Go see it-- you'll like it!",10,2,3,2 April 2001
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Bold idea, very entertaining. Spectacular music! But it's not for everybody
","I am adding this single, top paragraph two weeks after I first wrote and posted my comments here on IMDb. I just found out that 'Tenacious D' is, evidently, Jack Black and Kyle Gass' real band, in biz around LA since 1991. Unless that web-based info is part of an elaborate hoax. If legit, it does explain the virtuosity described below. Just wanted to say, I was not aware of them, nor, therefore, was I a fan, particularly. But to give credit where credit is due, those guys do a marvelous tribute/comedy cover 'review' of the hair band phenomenon. It also explains, to a degree, Black's involvement with 'School of Rock'. Kind of a long way to go to nurse a one-laugh gag, but hey--- this movie did have its bright and stirring moments!'Tenacious D' is not for everybody. It has some stellar moments, but also some lamer moments. It's a bit uneven. But overall, it is a bold concept movie that works. I was entertained.Jack Black has by now proved himself to be a pretty funny guy. He's got a charming naive 'chutzpah' that makes him an endearing character, no matter how stupid his on-screen behaviors have been written to be.The other guy, Kyle Gass, is a new one for me. But his pudgy, middle-aged self was somehow sympathetic for the audience. At first I thought Gass would be a 'Curley Joe'--- the odious actor who was a horrible 3-Stooges replacement, trying to steal the role of the late, great 'real' Jerome 'Curly' Howard. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gass' resemblance to Curley Joe was merely a superficial resemblance. He pegged the character of the aging loser, who dreams of a rock career, and who is, at the end of the day, a complete 'nobody', perfectly. His character is every comic book store clerk, Dungeons & Dragons master player, and general nerd, geek, and flake stereotype. But you really LIKED the character anyway.I don't know who did the music for this movie, but it was fantastic. If you love the memories of the 70s and 80s hair bands, you'll find this rendition very skilled. Not mere mimicry, but an amazing set of stylistic creations. They say you have to be a true virtuoso in order to do comedy music--- this movie seems to prove that point. Some real songs were woven in with some excellent new stuff. The writing, and the musicianship, were spectacular.It's a bit salty, and raunchy--- probably not a good date movie,. unless your date likes a good gross laugh. Intriguing movie--- not perfect, and kind of unique and weird, but that should be a welcome thing in this era when we all like to complain that all movies have become money-obsessed cookie-cutter clones of every other movie. This one is no clone! I gave it an 8 out of 10, with the caution that not everyone will get it, or like it.",8,4,9,19 November 2006
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Wonderful movie! Fitting send-off for Richard Harris-- Now bring in Sean Connery as the 'fittest' new Dumbledore
","This flick was great! I took a 6 year-old kid, and he loved it. I asked him later if he was scared (he held his jacket in his lap during the movie just in case he needed to cover his eyes during the scary parts-- how cute is THAT?). He said it was a little scary DURING the show, but in a good way. And not at all scary for him afterwards, he said.Everyone else has probably said all there is to say already. I will add only that the best new casting choice for Dumbledore is probably Sean Connery. Think about it--- he wouldn't be doing a mere 'impersonation' of the late, great Richard Harris--- he'd be doing a new thing; his own thing. The transition to such a new figure behind the character's mask would be a smooth one in Connery's extremely capable hands. Such a bold move on the part of the producers would literally be a 're-casting' of the role, in the best possible way, rather than an 'attempt' at shoe-filling.If you're an adult--- go see Harry Potter, kid in tow or no kid in tow. You'll love it for its own wonderful sake! 10 out of 10",Null,0,0,21 November 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," All meringue, no pie. A pretentious and tiresome piece of narcissistic fluff, by some self-absorbed Hollywood players
","This is narcissistic fluff. I suspect this movie is trying to imitate some of the famous 'couples movies' from the 1930s and 1940s, such as the Nick and Nora Charles characters in the 'Thin Man' series, and Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn in 'Bringing Up Baby'. Sorry, but NO way are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie anywhere near the class of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn!Nothing against Brad and Angelina Thingy personally. The fact that those actors have their own lives, and the right to pursue their professions in whatever way they see fit is not lost on me. God bless 'em! Let them go for it. But surely, after having cringed my way through several of their movies in the past, I should have learned my lesson and stayed well away from any movie they are starring in.Think of the Danny Divito 1989 movie 'War of the Roses', which was vicious and rather ugly, when you consider it. Then imagine that movie having the sheer delusion that it could be one of the William Powell and Myrna Loy detective couple movies, or Grant and Hepburn. Sort of sad, really. A weird and sick blend of marital cutesy and really gross and hurtful violence.This flick is offensive. It is stupid, it is silly and worst of all, it is guilty of taking itself, even in its alleged whimsy and spoofiness, WAY too seriously. It might be OK viewed on DVD at home, whilst drunk. Otherwise, this fluffy piece of crap is all meringue, and no pie.",3,22,45,9 June 2005
War of the Worlds," 'Outside the box' movie-making. Magnificent! Atmospheric, human, and artful. A classic movie for future ages.
","Viewing this movie from the ordinary 'modern' audience perspective that enjoyed 'E.T.' or 'Independence Day' might have lead some to have been disappointed. Being able to switch your head around, though, and see this through new eyes will assure you a magnificent movie experience! Being true to the original Vicotorian-era H.G. Wells novel, and taking huge and courageous leaps of artistic risks that pay off handsomely for all of us, director Steven Spielberg has created an immense and awe-inspiring movie. He has clearly made a movie from 'outside the box'. Not everyone may appreciate this at first, perhaps, but eventually this will be seen as a breakthrough classic.I've seen dozens of critic's remarks about this film prior to seeing it today, its opening day in Wales. Some appeared to like it because 'stuff blowed up real good', while others moaned that it was 'too dark', not at all sunny and cheerful, and it wasn't 'E.T.'. Still others criticized the movie because the Martian invasion wasn't 'practical' (which is wasn't), and the tactical and strategic behaviors of the Martian invaders were not logical (which they weren't). Well--- yeah. They are all correct--- the Martian killing machines were definitely Victorian. The sounds they made could well have been London-ish mechanical war sounds from the 1890s or so, if the English had built giant robots and invaded the rest of the planet at that time. Rather than being frustrated at the illogical details, or the evident lack of sound thinking on the Martians' part, I found all of that extremely atmospheric. It was frightening, thrilling, entertaining, and delightful.Spielberg took a chance, and went in a direction he hadn't gone before. This is definitely 'outside the box' film making. Bravo! May all the critics who so often complain and moan about lack of originality in modern movies and Hollywood please try to reward an originator in this instance. I gave 'War of the Worlds' a well-deserved 10 out of 10.P.S. Watch for the quickie cameo-homage appearance of Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, toward the end of the movie. They were the stars of the original film, the 1953 version of 'War of the Worlds'. An appropriate, classy, and fun move for Spielberg!",10,2,9,30 June 2005
Love Actually," A rare and astounding ensemble performance of true artists. Inspires love, uplifts our 'human-ness'
","The premise, which you must know by now, is the romantic trajectories of 8 couples. Even critics who praise it have remarked that the filmmakers were a tad bit rushed to find satisfactory conclusions to each couple's romantic potential. I disagree! The premise, that 'love is, actually, all around', is a delightful and uplifting tale. Following the characters through from promising beginnings, to uncertain middles, all the way to emotionally resonant ends is a legitimate and worthy enterprise.There are no spoilers here, although I would say that it does not stretch the imagination too much to anticipate certain types of outcomes in a romantic comedy. All of the story lines, even those with a bit of sadness, feel true- to me, anyway. I was, at all times, able to identify with the scenes on the screen (a TV screen for me, because I had only gotten to watching 'Love Actually' recently, on DVD).The cast of 'Love Actually', is, duh, an amazing constellation of superb actors. Some 'star vehicles' contain only stars, seemingly not really portraying anything meaningful, but merely being their own famous selves. The assemblage of stars here, however, is that rarest of things--- an assembly of world-class artists and 'presences'. Each was perfectly cast, each gives a natural and astounding performance.I loved this movie! I found it a rich and delightful source of inspiration and upliftment. Hurray for all involved. I gave it a well deserved 10 out of 10.",10,3,5,27 June 2005
Ice Age," Almost could have gone Direct To Video. Bright moments and lots of dull and bad stretches
","'Ice Age' is one of the most mixed and uneven movies I've seen in a long time. Overall it was 'OK.' There were wonderful aspects-- and some really bad aspects. The mammoth and the sloth, for example, were amazing bits of animation. The water at the end of the movie was also marvelous. Some of the scenes, though, were cheesey rip-offs of way better films. Note the similarity between the mountain cave passages in 'Ice Age' and the flying whale scene in Disney's 'Fantasia 2000.' The flying whales, and the whole trapped under the iceberg thing--- was enchanting, evocative, uplifting, and a masterpiece. The rip-off version in 'Ice Age' by contrast seems dim, depressing, and dreary.Much of 'Ice Age' resembled the frenetic and abbreviated desert scenes of the later, crappier, Road Runner cartoons. I saw 'Ice Age' in a small town full of ordinary people. The audience at my showing was a mix of small and medium kids and their parents. There were a few moments of 'Ooooh!' and a few quiet chuckles. One or two kids guffawed every time an animal stepped on a stick and got hit in the face. Otherwise, the theater was pretty quiet. I think we were all waiting for the cool part to start, when all of a sudden, the movie was over.Referring again to the moments of goodness-- the tigers looked awful, but Dang! The mammoth and the sloth looked great. Their fur was so well done! But if it weren't for their great looking fur, this movie could probably have gone straight to video.Take the kids! Take the grandparents. But to keep from boring yourself into a stupor, get drunk first (but don't drink and drive, take a taxi!).",5,1,2,22 March 2002
The Last King of Scotland," Marvelous masterpiece! Forest Whittaker went far beyond a mere character impersonation, to recreate the essence of Amin
","Forest Whitaker did an amazing job here. He resembled Idi Amin--- looked like him, moved like, and sounded like him. But Whitaker's performance was much, much more than a mere impersonation. He really inhabited the guy. The vibe was so full, and so complete! It was as if Whittaker recreated him in a perfect translation for us, the movie audience. That is a rare and marvellous thing. Whitaker more than deserves his Oscar nomination. There are some worthy candidates for best actor this year. Others also did great jobs, and deserve to win as well. But Whitaker also clearly did a masterful job, and clearly deserves to win as well. His portrayal went far beyond the trendy and gimicky 'impersonations' of famous folks.The story is scary and sort of creepy. But as far as a westerner such as myself can know, it appears to be real. It has a ring of truth and authenticity to it. News stories report the Scottish doctor character was indeed a conglomerate of real-life white visitors to Amin's world. I was engaged and engrossed in the movie from the first scenes that took place in Africa. What an amazing movie! And being true, it also rang with a certain satisfaction that not many movies do.The Scottish doctor was all too human. He was not painted as any kind of do-gooder or saint, which I liked. How many of us could have resisted the temptations he was faced with? I would guess that most of us would have done exactly as he did, and probably worse. Even though he was a fictional character, it seems that he was based on a conglomerate of western, white people and their behaviour when confronted with the favour of koo-koo despots with unlimited power and wealth. He was seduced. But I think most of us would have been as well.Overall, a stupendous movie! Please don't be shy about the reality theme, nor the grittiness. it had some gory moments, but wasn't all 'The Killing Fields'-y, as I had feared. It was thrilling, fast-paced, and truly human. I gave it a well-deserved 10 out of 10. And good luck at the Oscars, Mr. Whitaker! I hope you win.",10,3,4,28 January 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Funny! Satirizing the 'news models' but appreciating the poor dim-wits nonetheless!
","Nice blend of slapstick, subtlety, and wit--- very funny and humorous movie! Moreover, it also has 'heart,' and a genuine story (romance? drama?). Will Ferrell's characters in other movies, such as the magnificent and under-appreciated 'Dick,' (1999-ish) and the solid 'Zoolander,' (2001)have always been unpleasant dorks. His characters have always been the darker, villainous types, always odious. 'Anchorman,' however, avoids the easy path of making his character simply a prat, simply an a**hole. The character is, actually, dim-witted and naive, rather than malevolent or mean. One gets the impression that he just doesn't know any better, that he wouldn't be all that bad of a person to know, even when he does do the arrogant and narcissistic things (typical of many, one assumes, who lust after careers as 'news models').The supporting cast, especially Christina Applegate, are wonderful! Overall, a funny movie with a bit more depth and meaning than might have been in a satire. Well worth seeing!",9,1,3,13 September 2004
Hitch," Botched job. Some bright moments with the supporting cast, but 'Hitch' is not funny, not romantic, not believable, even as a fantasy
","'Hitch' has some pieces of better movies in it. But those good pieces are hopelessly tangled and mangled in a mean-spirited failure. It seems that writer Kevin Bisch and director Andy Tennant have seen lots of good romantic comedies over the years. The polite thing would be to say that they envisioned an homage to the genre. A more blunt expression would be that they ripped off what they thought were the cute bits from other people's work. There are stretch marks all over this turkey. At the end of the day, they missed the point entirely. 'Hitch' is not at all funny, nor even pleasing, nor is it particularly romantic.Will Smith is a good actor--- likable, strong presence, wholesome demeanor. That was obvious here, although he might have phoned in part of this performance. In a very weird way, the most successful bit of sex and romance with Will Smith came in a comedy bit involving not a chick but the dude, Kevin James' character.The rest of this cast are largely unknown, Michael Rappaport's (Sp?) and Adam Arkin's cameos notwithstanding. The cast of yet-to-be stars appear to have reasonably strong chops, and some of them may well make it as successful and long-career actors. In fact, the surprising bits of the only grace and good vibes (the rare portions that approached romance) came from the two 'secondary' characters, Albert and Allegra, played by Kevin James and Amber Valletta. The sparks and romance between them were believable, and really nice to watch.Will Smith's character was actually believable enough most of the time, but the female lead he was saddled to was a first class ****. I don't know what part of this character, named Sara, seemed funny or endearing to the writer or director. In real life, such a demonic witch would have gotten a prison sentence for aggravated assault, and would be avoided as a poison by all who had even heard of her. Whatever, in this movie's universe she was not in prison, and not shunned---- but what could Smith's character have possibly seen in her? She wasn't beautiful, merely sort of pretty, in a trashy kind of way. She wasn't nice, wasn't funny, wasn't witty, wasn't sexy. Oh well, that is a head-scratcher. She and the odious Vance character were actually the better match for each other.So, lofty aspirations, fellas, but stick to the old adage, and only write what you know. So go out and have some real romance and some real love, laughs, life, etc., before you attempt to make another movie. I gave this a 4 out of 10.",4,4,8,19 March 2005
The Terminal," Textured and deep, life-like and worthy, but not a 'funny' comedy as it had been advertised to be
","'The Terminal' was advertised as a comedy, but it wasn't at all funny--- It had texture, however,and some depth, and addressed some issues of human life that may be important. It is a worthy artistic piece, so overall it was a good movie nonetheless.One of the movie's qualities--- and both a strength and a weakness--- was the evident lack of single purpose, or, perhaps, obvious point. That is, it was unclear what the movie was actually about, and it was equally unclear what the movie was trying to say. Was it saying governments are mean? Borders are bad? Individual humans are mere victims at the whim of political and social powers? I sure couldn't tell what the movie folks thought about the issue, and that was a bit 'deflating' as far as my emotional involvement went. That might also explain why some readers here, for example, criticize the movie for being over-long and/or boring.On the other hand, raising such issues, especially in today's security conscious borders, is important. And raising the issues and providing clear and strong answers would have been a disservice to the audience. Leaving the questions unanswered, and simply percolating along, and the audience free to make up their own minds--- or at least give the matter some serious thought--- was a rarity in movies today, and a welcome bit of respect for us from Steven Spielberg as the director.An example of the disjointed vibe some folks have mentioned--- What was Catherine Zeta Jones' character doing in this movie? What was her character's purpose, and place in the scheme of things? Dunno... and that was a bit disconcerting. On the other hand, isn't life frequently like that? Don't we often encounter diverse and dis-connected phenomena, and attach what purpose to those things as suits our own little world at any given time? I think so--- The other characters were equally non-seqeutious--- but also equally plausible in the world of the central character, played by Tom Hanks.Overall, then, I liked this movie well enough, even with a touch of disappointment after finding that it was wasn't, as it had been advertised, a funny comedy.",6,0,2,6 September 2004
Music and Lyrics," Implausible fluff, mere candy floss, but sweet and enjoyable!
","This is a surprisingly average movie, with an implausible plot, and a dodgy set-up that would flop miserably in other hands. As it is, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are likable stars, and Haley Bennett, the young newcomer who plays the 'world's number one pop diva,' the Cora Corman character, is very apt for the part. She's perky, wickedly innocent, and out-Britneys Britney herself. She's what Britney Spears USED to be, years ago. Overall, is was rather lame and kind of stupid, but enjoyable in a 'two-hours of escapist fluff' kind of way. As nice as candy-floss (cotton candy), which has its place. Although I did not for one minute believe the pop-singer voice dubbed in for High Grant was really he!(It remains to be seen if Miss Bennett's career ever goes anywhere, or if the pop star glam in this flick was just a veneer that wears off in the first wash.)One of the things 'Music & Lyrics' brings up is the weird real-world of pop stardom and 'celeb' status anyway. Here in the UK, entire TV series are devoted to endless tripe about nobodies who somehow got to be called 'celebrities' for a few weeks. And even with those with an ostensible 'talent', such as pop-singing, one must ask oneself: Why is one singer or act famous, and another yesterday's news?That's a rhetorical question, of course. It certainly seems that the way the real-life Britney Spears and Madonnas get to be number one, famous, and so rich, is as much a result of pure luck and marketing as anything else. One likes to think there was a day, back in the 60s and 70s, perhaps, when true artistry was a prerequisite for celebrity. True, many real geniuses did not make it, and the coffee houses and Denny's (in the US) are filled with thousands of nice folks with real talent who have stories about how they 'almost' made it, but ended up ordinary, like the rest of us. Many great artists still can't make it today, too--- but blame the Fates, or karma, or Mega-Global-Com Inc.But wasn't it that way, once? You know--- when the vast majority of those who made it big and got famous had real talent? Or is that merely my nostalgic imagination? Anyway--- 'Music & Lyrics' reminded me of all of that. And middle aged Hugh Grant was believable as a self-described '80s has-been', and Drew Barrymore was charming and sweet. Although, to be honest, her plant-nanny character's instant lyrics and song skills resembled the advertising jingles continually cooked up on the old 60s TV show, 'Bewitched'. Barrymore reminded me more than once of Bewitched's hapless Darren Stevens, at the phony and clichéd McMahon & Tate Advertising Agency. Oh well.",6,1,3,12 February 2007
Blade Runner," The DVD director's is spectacular! This movie really holds up after 18 years
","I just bought the DVD version of 'Blade Runner-- Director's Cut.' I couldn't quite tell what new material was added, nor how this was different. It's been 18 years since I last saw it, so that's not a surprise. The character voice-over narration from Harrison Ford is gone-- I think I miss it? Overall, though, this excellent and ground breaking old movie holds up superbly and strongly in the year 2000-- at least on DVD wide-screen. I rated it a solid '10.'",10,0,0,21 February 2000
Bruce Almighty," Hilarious and uplifting. A remarkable, joyful movie. Anniston, Carrey, and Freeman are wonderful!
","Wow--- a really great movie! As a concept, 'Bruce Alimighty' could have gone in a number of directions--- a few good, many bad. But the course the movie takes is charming, winsome, wholesome, and remarkably reverent. It is hilarious, but also was 'about' something. I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie was about redemption, and self-empowerment. Love themes, and consciousness expanding themes, are usually met with derision and scorn by some lifeless, ego-tripping critics who consider themselves tragically hip, and somehow 'Cooler Than Thou.' Not surprisingly, there have been a few negative reviews by these members of the self-conscious Undead. However, many excellent critics have praised the movie, and I totally agree. It is life-affirming, funny, heart-warming. Thoroughly bright and entertaining.Jennifer Anniston is such a great actor! Who knew her TV gig would evolve her into a real person with amazing grace, wit, and heart? Yaay Jennifer! And Jim Carrey is equally amazing here, as is the always magnificent Morgan Freeman. Go see it with a loved one, or someone you hope will become a loved one. You'll be uplifted and very, very glad you went! 'Bruce Almighty' is a total 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,23 May 2003
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Majestic and splendid! Why the unfair attack by critics? A well-made and GREAT movie!
","Grand movie! First, I am truly and sincerely puzzled by the seeming 'attack' on this movie by the critics. From what I read, I expected a gaudy, clumsy 'bodice-ripper' girlie romantic movie type thing. Being a devoted fan of both Cate Blanchett AND Elizabeth I, I went anyway.How wrong the critics were! This movie succeeds on most levels. It was enthralling, fully entertaining, and engaging every moment. The atmosphere of the authentic palaces and castles gave it a wondrous feel. Granted, the ending had a few cinematic weak points. But bear in mind they were trying to depict a battle that took place over two days, as I recall from school, and hundreds of miles. In real life, the Spanish plan was very complex. But a freak storm drove the Spanish armada off course, and caused a series of cascading coincidences--- Spanish Phillip's navy had planned to join up with Dutch troops and soldiers in France, etc., etc.--- but the wheels came off. And the English DID capitalise on this brilliantly and win the war.While many forces combined up to make the Catholic Spanish plans go pear-shaped, how could a movie deal with all of that in just 10 minutes or so at the end of the film? The 'literary license' taken by the director to condense it all into a few dramatic moments is understandable, and forgivable. The SPIRIT of the denouement of Catholic Europe's attempt to topple Elizabeth was spot on. It was, by and large, historically accurate. Although her thrilling speech to the troops at Tilbury, as recorded by history, was not fully given here, and that was a loss. Her real-life remark: 'I have the weak body of a woman, but my father gave me the heart and stomach of a king!' sent the troops gathered there into a frenzy, making them ready and able to defend England against ANY enemy. But alas, those famous words were missing from this script. Oh well.I also read criticism that the music was too loud. Frankly, I didn't even notice it, it was perfect 'movie' music. Also, critics blasted the costumes as being too gorgeous, too elaborate. I am a bloke, and not into women's clothes. But even I was impressed by the costuming--- females and males alike; lead characters and background characters equally apt. What--- were the critics searching THAT hard for something harsh to say? They were way off base on this movie--- ignore them, and go enjoy yourself.As for the cast and the acting--- again, brilliant. As a self-confessed fan of Cate Blanchett, of course I am biased. But she and Geoffery Rush, both Australians, oddly enough, made a great and believable team. As did fellow Aussie Abby Cornish, who played Elizabeth's best friend, protégé, lady in waiting, or whatever--- and Walter Raleigh's booty call. And, again, not being a girl, I can only guess at the accuracy of the 'girls only' chit chat and boudoir scenes, but they SEEMED realistic to me. Elizabeth was one of history's greatest leaders. Her successes and political acumen and power went far, far beyond any dosage of mere 'luck.' She was, historically, a true political genius. And I believed the movie when it portrayed her as considering all of England as her children.I never did understand the full extent of what the heck Rhys Ifans' 'Robert Reston' was doing--- his plotting and such were clear, but then he simply got arrested and said his purpose was fulfilled, even though his plot to kill Elizabeth failed. Or WAS failure his plot? Or something else? I dunno... I suppose that's a cinematic weakness.And Clive Owens was mostly great as Mr., then Sir, Walter Raleigh. I liked his roughneck character--- although during the naval battle scene, which he did NOT participate in, he acted a tiny bit like Eerol Flynn in 'Captain Blood.' That was a bit lame, and after he sets his fire ship ablaze, and dives overboard, we magically see him dry and tidy on some other English bloke's warship, unsure how he got there.But those are mere quibbles. The atmosphere, the majesty of the royal court vibe, the history, even with its abbreviations and dramatisations, and the homage to the real Elizabeth's true greatness make this a splendid effort.Go with an open mind, ready to forgive a few minor flaws, and be ready to simply BASK in a sumptuous and enthralling drama that really did happen.",10,4,14,14 October 2007
Amélie," Pleasant fluff, but WAY overrated!!!
","There are no complaints when watching 'Amelie.' It is pleasant enough, and it even displays a bit of depth that is the hallmark of better romantic and 'feel good' comedies. However--- it isn't a great movie. It is no masterpiece. The foppish poseurs who drool over this light fare as if there were beholding some amazing jewel is getting a bit annoying. In the artsy theater in our town, I could hear the forced and hollow 'salon chuckles' of the local cognoscente wannabes, as if displaying to us all that they, too, 'get it.' Humbug! Those folks should get out more!This is a good movie, and it deserves to be watched and enjoyed. But dang, folks... while this emperor's new clothes may not be totally imaginary, he is, nonetheless, given all the uber-hype and Oscar predictions for this cinematic bauble, severely underdressed.",7,5,8,16 January 2002
A Walk to Remember," WAY above most teen movies-- Authentic, sweet, and very real!
","Great for what it is, and what it sets out to portray. 'A Walk to Remember' is a well made, thoughtful movie. It is dramatic in a manner one might think is aimed at adolescents. But what makes it appealing to adults as well as kids is the 'truth' of the drama. That is, unlike many teen movies that seem to capitalize on the angst-y, overblown melodrama and theatrical nature of teenaged fantasy, 'A Walk' touches on very real and important (albeit sometimes very quiet) issues that everyone deals with throughout their life.'A Walk' is also very sweet, but avoids sentimentality. Overall, it is a very authentic and meaningful depiction of some of the big issues facing us all: Our choices, self and social identities, and having a vision of who we want to become, and how we go about becoming that. Perhaps this is a bigger issue to one who is 16 or 18 or 19 years old, but it certainly reappears over and over to some degree or other throughout our life span.The performances were especially great. Peter Coyote is a strong, skilled, and delightful presence. Daryl Hannah (Sp?) is unrecognizable as a brunette, so we get to experience a wonderful aspect of her character-- which is totally on-target and deep here-- without being distracted by her glamor and stardom. I was enjoying her as the mom for the first 2/3 of the movie, wondering to myself, 'Where have I seen this amazing actress before?' before it dawned on me that it was she. Good job to both of them!Mandy Moore was grand, avoiding all cliche of the 'ugly duckling' female character we have seen so many times before. The male adolescent lead, Whats-his-name, at first struck me as a bit young Charlie Sheen-ish, and therefore a tiny bit of a rip off. But upon reflection I saw his portrayal as 100% appropriate. After all, isn't this what 17 or 18 year-old boys are like in real life? Especially the confident and popular ones? You know, a bit of posturing, a bit of performance, a bit of bravado, and a bit of uncertainty and fear. And yet in the end, the better ones are capable of change, capable of personal breakthroughs and transformations for the better.Overall, an excellent movie! I gave it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,30 January 2002
Gangs of New York," 'A Fist Full Of Phony Scenery' -- What a substandard piece of crap! A waste of talent and time. BO---RING!!!!
","Bad movie. It looked like one of those stale 1972 movies. It also continually reminded me of 'A Fist Full of Dollars' and similar old timey Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. You know, those cheap-o movies with only two sets that look fake and flat. Oh wait.... it was exactly like a 1950s live TV drama. Those were excusable in the early days of television--- all the action takes place on essentially the same set on a small stage. But in these modern times?'Gangs of New York' may disconcert some because the historical premises are not widely known. But the problems with 'Gangs of New York' go far beyond any potential discomfort with those novelties.As an epic, this is too stylized. As a style piece, it isn't stylistic enough. It has a claustrophobic feel--- as if all the action takes place on the same small set. Cut-aways to an artist's drawing of Manhattan at the beginning and the end of the movie try to give us a geography and a context, but they only remind us we are NOT seeing a large city. The suffocatingly small sets are more suited to a stage musical, and an old stale one at that--- something forgettable from the 70s.I was reminded of 'Goodfellas'--- a movie that film essayists and others revere. I saw it, and was affected by its ugliness and brutality. Why did Scorcese feel the need to make that one? 'Goodfellas' is so ugly as to be a psychic and emotional pollution, a form of 'vibe abuse.' 'Gangs of New York' is similar--- one wonders what Scorcese's point was. Are we supposed to think that immigrants were crazy? That Europeans were nuts? That Irish are 'bad'? Or, Irish are 'good'? New York had a past? The mid 1800's sucked as a century? I think everybody's life the world over sucked in those days. Remember, the real-life historical Irish evidently thought what they had in New York, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Broadbent, Cameron Diaz and all--- was nonetheless better than what they had fled in Britain.But what's the point here? ANY point? This movie seems so unnecessary, and thus such a waste. In any event, it is boring. I mean BORING!",3,2,7,28 December 2002
Joy," Lovely - though rich and quiet, a powerful Life Choices type adventure
","Unexpected pleasure. Jennifer Lawrence drew me in; then the depth and 'truth' of the story got me to enjoy it all. I read some negative notices saying it was 'boring.' I can see why a nervous person might say that - this movie is about that deep place inside us where we make our life choices. That may not be a thrill like a car chase or a shoot-out, but it was immensely more engaging.I don't care if this is a faithful biopic or not. It might be - but it doesn't matter. The script and narrative were about the heart - make that Heart. Life often sucks; sometimes disappointment could easily be life's middle name. This story was about a woman who slogged through the pile of doodoo life dealt her, found the family and love and joy (and all that good stuff) that is at the core of us all, made the tough, life affirming choices and persevered until strength and happiness (and grace) were her real, genuine experience.Robert Di Niro's character was a bit of a bully - passive-aggressively, AND aggressively. I like cheerier stories, and would have chosen to eliminate that character, or at least his prominence in the story. Same with her mother, and Peg, the half sister. But to the character Joy's credit, she tolerated them all, without undue fuss and without rancor. My first impulse would not have been to do that - and I found Joy's forgiveness and grace inspiring.Overall, excellent movie. I am surprised the poo-pooers had the gall to post their whiny little cries of 'boring!' and 'what's the POINT?' online, for the whole world to see how shallow and dull they are. Oh well, takes all kinds, I guess.Lastly - I think it must be time for director David O. Russell's recent cinematic shtick to be over. That is, the Di Niro, Lawrence, Cooper trio thing is on the edge of becoming tiresome. All are so talented - but they need to move on to higher and brighter pastures, with different people. IMHO",10,12,31,26 December 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," Not nearly as good as the original. 'OK' overall, but also a bit disappointing and unsatisfying
","WARNING --- SPOILERS!!! I really loved the first movie in what now seems to be a series. I always like Matt Damon, and I also like the German actress, Franke Potente, and feel we have been seeing far too little of her in Hollywood movies, or at least movies available to us in the English language movie world.'The Bourne Supremacy' was advertised with the characters played by Matt Damon and Franke Potente diving back into some wacky spy world, danger, thrills, etc. But that was misleading. She gets killed off in the first set piece! I didn't time her screen time in minutes, but it couldn't have been more than 9 or 10 before she dies! She is shot dead in the opening scenes, and the bulk of the movie is without her. Fortunately, at least Julia Stiles' character survives long enough to play a part in the story--- but even that is not really satisfying--- after some dramatic and meaningful action between her character and Damon's, she kind of disappears and is never referred to again-- what actually happens to her? But that's just one of many unanswered questions raised in this rather vague sequel.Overall, the movie is entertaining, I guess, although more than once I found myself confused by seemingly arbitrary and unexplained developments in the storyline. I was disappointed, and a bit dissatisfied by the whole experience.",10,0,1,13 August 2004
The Soloist," Master cast. Admirable characters, True story, real characters, so lots of acting courage, but not so much inspirational...
","MAJOR SPOILERS!!! Is the writing spot-on? Yes. Is the acting performed by very likable masters of the art, and with great skill? Yes. Is the story worth telling? Probably. Is this one of those uplifting and light filled movies of redemption? Erm... not so much. It is based on a true story, and life isn't always so pretty. This movie is NOT pretty! The trailers implied there would be beautiful music, and the beauty of the music and the very act of learning (once again) to re-create it would save a soul. Again, not so much. Nathaniel Ayres Jr. is/was a genuinely crazy man. Not cute. His personality and demeanour, on the surface, anyway, are marbled with profound humility and heartbreaking misfortune. One hopes, and because it's a movie, expects, him to be lifted out of it.Again, the trailer has a voice-over of Steve Lopez, played with superb honesty and courage (because he is, alas, no miracle worker. He is only human, like the rest of us) has been greatly edited. His words about friendship, and the real-person/character of Ayres, end with something about 'This friendship, in the end, takes you home.' In the actual movie, you hear the whole paragraph, and it is, again, more ordinary, more human.Are the people in this movie admirable? Yes. Inspirational? Not so much.Acting praise must go to Katherine Keener, Jamie Foxx, and Downey Jr. God, they are good.",7,6,10,25 April 2009
Dodgeball," Hilarious, above-average spoof. Hugely funny, and Brits should also be able to enjoy it!
","Hugely funny! And like all good comedies, this one has many layers of subtlety (well, sort of), permitting appreciation at many levels. Some Brits may not get all the North American references and jokes, probably. Such cross-cultural differences are unavoidable, and were illustrated recently in the London newspapers' reviews of the wonderful 'Shrek 2,' for example. But they all will nonetheless have a great time.Will Brits know that dodgeball is a common children's game, and its quasi-violent theme makes it somewhat of a rite of passage in many American's memories of primary school? Dunno... but they should be told that dodgeball, portrayed as a 'sport' in this movie is a total gag, joke, folly, etc. Reminding us of the male modeling world in the under-rated 'Zoolander.' It makes a wonderfully sardonic backdrop for the sheer silliness and deep humor of Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and the ever-great and immensely talented Rip Torn.This isn't a masterpiece, and may not even be 'great,' per se, but it is very good, and well worth making the trip out to see. Not for children, however, as it is extremely raunchy! I gave it a 9 out of 10.",6,1,2,23 August 2004
