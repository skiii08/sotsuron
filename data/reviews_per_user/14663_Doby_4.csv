The Blair Witch Project," That Last Scene - WHEW!
","As many readers before me have contested, this movie was truly excellently done!  Well-deserved kudos to all involved because it did truly frighten me. I went to see this BY MYSELF on my 1/2 day off from work and, as Paula O'Keefe says in her user comment, I was *NOT* breathing during the tremendous final ten minutes (quote/un-quote).  I found myself holding my breath, seriously, during the whole last climax, which I believe was longer than ten minutes and I had to remind myself to physically breathe.I found this film terrifying because it left everything up to my imagination.  I do not consider myself creative, but when it comes to imagination for horror, I guess I have it!  I must agree with Rick Peach's user comment of 'The last shot of this film will be stuck in my head for years to come' because it will be; it truly will be.  When I finally remembered the story and figured out why the last shot was done the way it was, BINGO ... I had trouble sleeping that night and I did have nightmares, I hate to admit!All in all, a wonderful movie that I look forward to dragging my husband to see with me.  I HAVE to see it again!  I hope it's number one in its wide-release weekend!!!",8,1,2,1 August 1999
The Butterfly Effect," Definitely the Director's Cut!
","I definitely prefer the DIRECTOR'S CUT! I completely agree with whoever wrote that the DC ending was one of the most fitting EVER in Hollywood. I could hardly believe what I was watching, but I agreed with Evan's decision. Yes it is the saddest thing, but I think it makes the movie that much richer. It just makes the BEST sense!!For those who think too much, this is just a movie. It's pure entertainment :) on a different level than most 'normal' cinematic films. We're all aware of paradoxes. That's not what the movie is about. I was too caught up in the movie to think about that stuff.I was slightly surprised by the darkness of this movie, but the whole thing went together so well. Kudos to most of the actors in the movie, but truly to Ashton Kutcher. I admit it took me too long to see this film b/c he was in it. But I am glad I did. I will definitely recommend this movie, the Director's Cut, to anyone who enjoys a good movie. I don't think the theatrical release is even worth watching, but that's just one opinion.",Null,0,2,30 October 2004
Mission: Impossible II," Great except for my theatre
","Just to say that this movie would have been quite excellent if our theatre had taken the time to make sure its THX was working properly!  They handed free passes at the end of the film due to various people leaving the film to complain.  Who wants to leave an action-packed adventure film like MI2?!Besides the sound, this was a great movie:  excellent acting, out-of-this-world stunts, and beautiful scenery - and I am not a Tom Cruise fan even though I'm a female!  Basically, what you'd expect, plus a little more :-)  Enjoy this film - it's darn good!",10,1,1,25 May 2000
There's Something About Mary," The 2 guys
","I just have to mention that I really enjoyed the two guys who sang and played the guitars.  My guy clapped at the end of the movie (those of you who saw it know why) and I slapped him!  I enjoyed their singing!!!  I'm the only one, so far, but I did!This film was highly humorous, not what I expected at all.  I even laughed at the dog-scenes, and I have 2 of my own.  I was pleasantly surprised at this movie and now understand why everyone talks about it so much (even still).",8,0,0,26 March 1999
