The Blair Witch Project," Creepy, Disturbing...I recommend it!
","This film was definitely one of a kind, and it was truly impressive for such a low-budget film.  This film has not been Hollywood-ized in any way...the lines in the movie are not polished by any means.  The amateur filmmaking itself made the movie seem all the more real.  And the fact that there is no soundtrack to spice things up only adds to the seeming reality of it all.  I would not, however, recommend this movie for anyone that gets queasy easily, not because of any gore or blood in the movie (in fact, there's barely any of that), but because of the shakiness of the camera throughout the film. I myself got a little queasy from it, but all in all it was worth it, especially in the final minutes of the movie. Oh, and be sure to pay close attention to the interviews....enjoy!",9,1,1,2 August 1999
