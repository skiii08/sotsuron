Alien 3," Not as bad as some think
","As most know, this isn't exactly the best the Alien series has to offer. But it's not as bad as some say.  Personally, I like it, and I like it for a lot of reasons. Now, as for me, Aliens is my all-time favorite movie and there is rarely a film out there that even comes close to touching it's glory, so why even begin to compare?  Alien 3 is a movie all in it's own.  Yes, it's a bit slow, not as action packed, and there is a little too much swearing (but hey, they're convicts) but it's also a very tense and realistic story.  Like the first two, the plot and story line are sound and believable.  Unlike the first two, it's not an action movie and I think that's where it lost some people.  Yes, it does have action in it, but that's not it's main focus.  I think this installation to the series needs to be viewed for it's powerful grip and sense of realism.  It's so real, the viewer almost feels as if they're really there (which would suck big time).  Unlike it's piece of junk sibling (Resurrection) it really is a good movie and well worth a watch if you're not comparing it to it's two older and more powerful brothers.  Plus the musical score is excellent. And after reading the alternate scenes, I wish they'd release that to the public!  I know I'd buy it in a second.",7,1,5,15 September 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Good, but could have been done without
","Alien: Ressurrection was definitely a good movie, but lacked much of the strength and purity of the other three.  As in Aliens, the plot was perfect, there were no holes, no corny lines, no cheesy plot.  Alien: Ressurrection had its share of these.  Put it this way, three times in the movie, twice in almost a ten minute span did someone come out from behind a door, just happening to come upon the main group, and just so happening to be (every time) a crew member they thought had died earlier.  Only like 3 or 4 main people died so the aliens weren't that much of a threat.  And you didn't get to see the aliens much, they were just kinda there, as if they were almost minor. It touched all areas of a good movie but lacked in every one of them.  It may be possible to reclone Ripley, but ones genetic code wouldn't include the alien.  This makes for a weak (but pretty cool) main idea.  The baby alien was evil, but dumb.  It was gross and irritating.  Everything that makes the Aliens series so good was altered and tampered with in Ressurection and just made for a poor addition to the Alien series.",4,1,1,1 December 1998
Alien: Resurrection," Definitely different than the other Alien films, but unfortunately, this is not a plus.
","Alien: Ressurrection was definitely a good attempt at a sequel but definitely fell short by a long, long way.  The other three Alien films were solid. Their plots were strong and held their own.  If the Alien species were to be real, these films would describe them perfectly, in mannerism and in habits, reproduction, and thinking patterns.  In Alien 4, much of this structure and solid foundation were thrown away.  It is easily proven impossible and contradictory in many ways.  Even the slime and gunk the aliens put off to build their homes was altered and very different. Alien: Ressurection was an addition that was best to do without.  The characters were somewhat weak except for Ripley's.  The only character that truly fit the alien movie specifications was the leader of the Betty crew and he was killed right away.  Too many times in the film did a door open and those who were still alive thought it to be an alien whereas it was someone they thought to have died earlier on.  It might have been ok if it was done once, but three times?  Two of them within 5 minutes of each other. Talk about lacking ideas for suspense. Speaking of suspense, the film wasn't even suspenseful, nor was it thrilling, and the action was weak and almost non-existent.  The film was so full of plot holes and unrealistic ideas and concepts that it was almost funny. And the 'Newborn'?  It was rather a stupid idea to begin with. Now I'm not saying that Alien: Ressurrection was a bad movie, there were some very strong points to it, such as how the newborn was torn between it's thinking of an alien and as a human was very realistic (even though the overall idea was dumb).  The film definetly would have done much better as an independent idea and film but completely lacked everything as an alien sequel.  It truly did not live up to it.  What a disappointment.",4,0,0,27 September 1999
Alien: Resurrection," How did this happen?
","How does Alien: Resurrection have a higher rating (on www.imdb.com) then Alien 3 does?  I'll WATCH Alien 3, I might even like it, but this movie is a total piece of trash. Alien 3 had a point, it was meant to be a dark, moody version of the Alien world and it succeeded.  There was a story behind Alien 3.  It might not have been the most exciting, but there was evidence that someone who cared had worked on it. Alien: Resurrection is an example of Hollywood making a little more money off of a franchise.  There's barely any story, just a bunch of people trying to get off of a space ship, most of which characters we WANT to die.  Just a dumb movie all around. In comparison to Alien 3, Alien 3 is definitely the superior film so I don't understand how Alien: Resurrection was rated higher.",4,1,2,11 December 2002
The Terminator," Awesome
","The Terminator, created after another one of James Cameron's reaccuring dreams (Abyss was another one.)  A true beginning in sci-fi movies.  As Schwarzenegger said to his friend when he was picked to play the part as the Terminator, 'they want me to play as some robot from the future in this weird sci-fi movie.' His friend said, 'take it.' Schwarzenegger is perfect as the Terminator, merciless, no fear, no love, no pity, no remorse, no emotions.  None could have pulled it off as well as he did.  Even his eyes showed no emotion with still showing true evil. Michael Beign is just the opposite.  A man sent from the future to stop this machine.  He plays his part as perfect as Schwarzenegger plays his.  A perfect cast of characters for an all star movie! Plenty of action, story line, plot, character interaction, love story, and romance.  Everything is tied into this movie that possibly could be, making it a 3 star movie.  Only drawback is it's a little dragged out at parts and gets slightly boring from time to time but it's so minor that one would have to think about it to care. A truly awesome movie.",10,11,12,22 September 1998
Predator," A different kind of Sci-Fi
","The most interesting part about this movie is that it's not a hi-tech sci-fi.  It's a down to earth movie with a sci-fi creature brought into the middle of it. Arnold Shwarzenegger potrays the main character, Dutch, in this film.  He's the leader of a special forces team assigned to investigate missing army operatives.  After completing their mission, they find themselves in the Central American jungle being stalked by an intergalactic hunter that collects the skulls of his kills for trophies.  Awesome acting, storyline, and non-stop action.  A definite must see.  Very different from any other kind of sci-fi and is pretty much uncomparable because there's nothing to compare. Do yourself the favor.",10,0,0,22 September 1998
Aliens," Simply Perfect
","Twelve years ago, James Cameron made the ultimate sci-fi movie ever created. At first, it was thought that either it would be a bomb and ruin his career or be a box office hit and all the credit would go to Ridley Scott (Alien). Both speculations were wrong.  In 1986, Cameron made the most amazing Sci-Fi movie imaginable.  Adding all the aspects of a thick plot, action, suspense, terror, and realism any movie could possibly handle.  The acting was perfect as was the special effect.  At a budget of $18 million, Aliens beats even today's visual masterpieces.  After years of watching Aliens, I was able to watch the special edition and saw the sentry gun scenes as well as the colony scenes, making the movie a whole 2 hours 34 minutes long.  I have one thing to say, 'simply perfect.'",10,4,6,22 September 1998
