It," Why Misuse Kids for the Sake of Entertainment?
","This is probably the first time that I've rated any movie so low. Why use kids to speak lot of profanity? And there are many scenes that have them deliver sexually charged lines too. When I saw it was A-rated, I figured it could be some violence or blood but now I know why. There's enough filth(words) that these kids throw up! Also, there's a particular scene(best left unsaid) that revolves around the young girl Beverly Marsh in her home that left me quite uncomfortable in my seat. Is this supposed to be entertainment? 'It' is technically a very well made movie with lots of tension and unpredictable jump moments but what is the point of it all? I feel sad for the kid actors, all of whom gave an excellent performance and Bill Skarsgard was also brilliant as the clown. Verdict - A big thumbs down. Kids are NOT adults, leave them alone!",2,6,14,13 September 2017
Train to Busan," A Very Good Zombie Thriller, Worth A Watch
","This is one of the better zombie movies I've seen in a long, long time. The zombies are scary and the first half of the movie packs a lot of tension. Especially the moments when the passengers(what's left of them) flee from the train and attempt to come out of a station and the utter mayhem that awaits them is probably the best part of the movie. There's good drama too, the notable among them like the father and daughter conversation or that between a pregnant wife & her husband. I was totally hooked until the final few scenes that I felt didn't pack much punch like the initial horror. There's also a particular scene towards the end where a negative character who survived so far finally gets bitten but how he turns while he still begs to be saved looked almost comical in this otherwise intense thriller. The best performances were from Eui-sung Kim as a very selfish passenger and child actor Su-an Kim. Verdict - get your popcorn & soda, and munch away your jitters while you watch this one.",7,1,2,13 September 2017
The Maze Runner," Good Scares, Suspense and Performances
","I like this movie not for its story but for the brilliant suspense, scare thrills, sound effects and the performances. The horror doesn't go overboard either and takes its time to grow on you and gets relentless only towards the final scenes deep inside the maze. The cast is good too especially few of the boys from the maze like Dylan O'Brien, Aml Ameen, Ki Hong Lee, Blake Cooper, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Will Poulter(very good as Gally the bully :)). Even the end was quite unpredictable. What I don't really get is the story. The people who built the maze intended something(revealed in the end) from it which didn't convince me well - all that complication just to find out a.......(spoilers) - which is why I'm not keen to watch out for any sequel that follow as hinted by a major character in the climax. Yet don't let a bunch of very young actors & a maze make you underestimate this movie. It engages you all the way and is watchable with family too.",7,0,0,11 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One - Not Just Visually Grand But Has Heart Too
","I don't think any Star Wars movies I've seen(at least those released since 1999) thrilled me the way Rogue One did - it has all the characters (humans, droids, aliens from different planets) and all those space ships, weapons or mammoth space stations like the earlier releases that fascinates one about Star Wars but also, the effects and the dark tone really captured my imagination.And I don't mean dark tone in a negative way. To see many of the major Alliance characters fight bravely and die in their war against the Empire only made the story of Rogue One more believable and likable for me. Of course there were moments that didn't make sense or fails to convince but that didn't matter, it was an enjoyable watch from start to end. It was also good to see many popular stars among the cast like Mads Mikkelsen, Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen or Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn as the ambitious, military director Krennic is my favorite performance among the lot. But my best part of the movie is when Darth Vader shows up in the climax - that entire scene of him is only a minute long but must have got the loudest whistles in the theatres. Verdict - this Star Wars is dark, funny, emotional, feel good, suspense...whatever I wanted or more from an action adventure, science fiction in space. A big thumbs up.",8,0,5,25 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," The Best Thor Movie So Far
","Indeed Ragnarok is the best Thor movie I've seen till date. The music when Thor unleashes his thunder at Hela's army is pure adrenaline rush, there's loads & loads of humor, the action is so well choreographed and of course the performances are very good. My favorite in the movie is Cate Blanchett as the Queen Hela - what a show of villainy! From a beautiful royal elf Galadriel in the Lord of the Rings to the ruthless Queen of Death, Hela in Ragnarok, she wows us effortlessly. Infact the female actors seemed to have stolen the show here like Cate and also Tessa Thompson as the warrior Valkyrie(her best scenes are her entry before the interval and also a slow motion walk towards Hela's army with her sword in hand). Of course Chris Hemsworth as the Thor himself entertained us with his machismo, wit and also few emotional moments. Also a Thor movie does not feel complete without the presence of the mischievous Loki and Tom Hiddleston excels again. One of my favorite actors is Karl Urban and it was great to see his funny side here in the role of a Asgardian warrior who changes loyalty at the drop of a hat. Also cool was the presence of the 90s heartthrob Jeff Goldblum as a ego maniac ruler, he provides much of the comic relief in the movie. I don't see much flaws except for some scenes towards the end(after Thor's final encounter with Hela) Some of those moments felt like a drag on the total movie time. Verdict: See it for the action, humor, music and the gorgeously evil Cate Blanchett.",8,2,4,30 December 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Lots of Humor and Very Good Effects But the Action Disappoints
","After we got to see a preview of actor Tom Holland as the new Spiderman in Captain America: Civil War, I must say he has grown into the character with this movie and is very likable. Moviegoers worldwide have kinda accepted him with open arms as the new Spidey just like they did with Ben Affleck as Batman. I find Michael Keaton better as a villain here than the Batman he once himself essayed decades ago. He was great in this movie. Marisa Tomei was a wrong choice as Aunt May compared to the mature, elderly look we were used to over the years and also I think such roles don't do justice to her talent. Laura Harrier as Spidey's love interest did good but had a weak, forgettable role. The action & the effects(especially) are good and there's lot of hilarious moments too yet I felt the comedy in the Tobey Maguire Spiderman movies were more natural and adorable. Also, the climax confrontation between Spidey and the Vulture was damp in its intensity and didn't feel bang for the buck. Otherwise, this Spider-man movie is a funny, clean entertainer and very watchable with family too.",7,4,6,13 July 2017
Justice League," A Heroic...Disappointment
","When I saw the trailer, I wasn't impressed...it's not the effects or the cast but there was something about it that lacked spark. Maybe it was a lack of bright, colorful visuals but when I actually got to see the movie, it left me very disappointed. The visuals infact felt ok and the effects are very good as expected. So were the cast performance. But the movie as a whole was still a let down. Did Zack Snyder really direct this? :( I guess a director is only as good as his writers or even choreographers. Many lines felt predictable, the action(except for Amazon warriors vs Steppenwolf) was average for DCU standards, few scenes were unnecessary(a 'race' between Flash & Superman for example) or cringe worthy and some of the important characters were wasted or weakly portrayed here like Lois Lane(Amy Adams), Martha Kent(Diane Lane), Commissioner Gordon(JK Simmons) or Alfred the butler(Jeremy Irons). These are hugely talented actors who could have been given a better deal in this movie or ensure that whatever little moments they've on cam don't look superficial. The lead actors(Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa & Ray Fisher) got to hog too much of the limelight that it end up wasting others' presence. Except for a short fight between Amazon queen Hippolyta & her army against Steppenwolf that hooked me for a while, everything else about movie was an uninspired watch. They even made Superman look yuck(digitally removed Henry Cavill's moustache and his face end up looking worse). Unless there's a major transformation among the people behind the camera - a change of director, writer or action choreographers etc - the sequel is gonna be a disappointment too.Verdict: Gal Gadot is still adorable, the others are ignorable and to sum up, this one is avoidable.",7,0,0,17 December 2017
Dunkirk," Beautiful Movie on the Dunkirk Evacuation
","At first, I thought Dunkirk was yet another war movie based on World War II. After I watched the movie, I learnt it's the story of the Dunkirk evacuation(captured beautifully)..about many heroes who saved the lives of those near them. And the heroes of that evacuation were not just the army, navy or the air force but innocent civilians too. What I especially liked is how the tragedy or horrors of war is effectively portrayed without the need for explicit violent scenes or display of blood. It was also quite a marvel to see the confrontation scenes between the Allied Spitfire planes and that of the enemy Heinkels. The performances were equally very good, the direction & cinematography were excellent and the music was apt too. There were big actors in the cast like Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy etc but you don't feel the weight of their stardom here as they & other actors were like tiny cogs who did their bit to move a beautiful wheel around. The best thing about the movie is the movie itself. Maybe there were a few cinematic liberties taken but it doesn't matter. It is a part of history that's important to know and I'm glad Christopher Nolan and his team brought that to the screen. Highly recommended.P.S. Saw this movie thrice in theatre already and still find it an inspiration.",9,4,11,26 July 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Great Effects But Wish They Kept Things Simple
","For a non-Marvel follower like me, this movie was too much for my senses. I did enjoy the effects and much of the action(atleast those that involved the characters Wanda or Vision because I found their relationship adorable) but felt for a sci-fi movie that's intention is to simply entertain, this one took itself too seriously and has left audience like me wondering that things could have been kept really simple. I wanted to be entertained the old fashioned way - a bunch of super heroes on Earth save the planet from a huge, aggressive, alien guy(or whatever Thanos is). Fight against him & finally destroy him, that's it. But here the story takes on many layers, I think with the objective to stimulate our minds and keep up thinking deeply about the characters. But these are comic characters, why complicate them? Maybe Marvel comics are for adults, not for kids. And I thought comics are created with primarily kids in mind...The performances, music, effects, action - all were mighty impressive(with whatever herculean budget that must have been offered, they better be) yet because these type of complex story telling is not my cup of tea, I rate the movie a 6/10.Verdict - if you are a Marvel fan, you'd probably love it I guess. Others, I wouldn't recommend it. Give me a B-grade monster movie any day.",6,2,7,16 May 2018
A Quiet Place," Very Creepy & Suspenseful, Wish the Action Was More
","A Quiet Place is a no-nonsense scare movie that has a good mix of family drama too. As in the Alien(1979) movie, we get to see only glimpses of the beasts as the movie progresses and they finally show themselves in all their terrible self towards the end.The performances are excellent especially from Emily Blunt as Evelyn Abbott. She manages to get the most footage and like Ripley in the Alien, she gradually learns to kick some a** for good especially towards the final scenes of the movie. John Krasinski(also the director here) makes his presence felt as the doting husband of Evelyn, father of 2 kids and who would go to any extent to save them from slaughter of these ruthless creatures. He's as good a director as an actor, the direction would get slightly more marks. Millicent Simmonds & Noah Jupe as the Abbott kids also convince in their roles especially Noah who's so natural & confident in front of the camera.The only flaw I can think of is the action. When it comes right down to it, there isn't much as you'd expect from a typical man vs creatures movie except for the climax moments. Maybe the sequel which seems to be in the works will be the stage for a more & dramatic showdown but I still wish there were more of it in this movie too.Verdict: Still, a very watchable creepy flick with enough tension to squeeze your nerves.",7,1,2,28 April 2018
Event Horizon," The Ship Looks Creepy, That's About It!
","I wonder if this movie was intended as a horror or just a dark sci-fi because there wasn't anything really creepy except for the look of the ship Event Horizon - its face resembles that alien from the Ridley Scott movies! The effects are quite good and there's also tense moments when the rescue crew docks with the ship and goes in to check for survivors. The performances are OK but I felt the choice of actors could have been better - Laurence Fishburne and Same Neill are the only ones who really held my attention. Some scenes confuse especially how a certain dead character comes back and attack the rest of the survivors. With the effects and the atmosphere they attempted to create, this movie had lots of box-office potential but failed to deliver as expected. Verdict - with lots of misses than hits, there was nothing much even Laurence Fishburne could do to save Event Horizon(ship or the movie)...a forgettable, one-time watch.",6,1,2,9 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Great Entertainment
","I have seen a couple of DC & Marvel movies in the last few years but none of them entertained me as much as any of the Star Wars movies. All of them are very watchable with your family and kids too. And the Last Jedi is another example of that. Its prequel, The Force Awakens was quite good but this one came out a lot, lot better. The music, the action, the light vs dark drama, the performances...everything about it hooked me to my seat for the 2 hours in the theatre. Unfortunately I haven't seen any of the Star Wars from the 70's or 80's but it's been a pleasure to watch the late Carrie Fisher's performance in the Last Jedi and the prequel. The rest of the cast are also good but my favorite in the movie has been Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, especially how he struggles constantly with his conscience to destroy the Resistance forces. The effects and the camera work are brilliantly done as expected. There were some scenes especially the Jedi training scene by Luke Skywalker with Rey(very well portrayed by Daisy Ridley) or his confrontation towards the end with Kylo Ren that could have confused many viewers but maybe it's best left to our own interpretation. I especially liked how spiritual these scenes were.I think few of the action between the First Order and the Resistance or escape by some of the Resistance characters looked a bit too unbelievable but even so, the movie as a whole more than made up for any flaw I felt.Verdict: Absolutely loved it. Watch it with family, friends or alone and may the Force be with you :)",8,1,4,31 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A Noisy Entertainer
","It's a good action movie with beautiful special effects that hold your attention from start to the end. But although it has racy action, at times I felt it needed more drama or stillness(that way I liked the predecessor) than more of zip, zap, zoom! But this movie is laced with more humor when compared to the previous one and therefore made it quite watchable for me. All the lead actors are good but my favorite performance would be Karen Gillan as Nebula, she's very expressive and also Michael Rooker as Yondu. In one or two scenes, I felt Chris Pratt looked quite aged(I felt it was the makeup), they could have gone easy on the close up shots. Verdict - a bit too noisy for me but still fun and bam bam action, you could like it.",7,1,4,11 May 2017
The Shape of Water," I Didn't Like the Shape of the Story..
","At first, congratulations to Guillermo del Toro for the Best Director Oscar for this movie. I guess one of the main reasons for that is how he got all the actors to deliver excellent performances especially Michael Shannon(as the ruthless colonel Strickland) and Sally Hawkins(the mute cleaning woman Elisa who falls for the amphibian man). The movie also offers beautiful visuals(of a 60's era) and also the effects are masterfully done.So, on paper it seems like a fascinating movie but ends up as a surprise disappointment. For one, I don't understand the need for a sexual scene that involves Strickland or even if we were to ignore that, the use of graphic violence many times. As a viewer, I could already feel the brutality of his character in many scenes that didn't have an explicit display of blood or gore. Maybe the writers were not confident they could deliver a wonderful cinematic experience without them. Some moments were even unintentionally funny. There's a song & dance routine like in Bollywood between Elisa & the amphibian man, thankfully that gets over within a minute. And the climax encounter between this amphibian dude & Strickland where in those final brief moments, we see this thing all of a sudden emote and fight back like a pissed off lover! Another aspect of the movie that annoyed me is a remark by one of the characters Zelda(very well essayed by Octavia Spencer), Elisa's close confidante at work, about her dislike for people who biologically look a certain way. It was a minor conversation but I found it offensive and irrelevant to the story. So unfortunately, Shape of Water is a thumbs down for me. It could really have been an otherwise epic cinema. If you still want to, watch for the shape of performances and the beautiful cinematography.",6,5,10,8 March 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Horror Entertainer Worth A Watch
","I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. There's not a single moment that drags - it keeps you hooked from the word go. The choice of cast was good, perhaps the only weaker choices I felt were Tom Hiddleston as a skilled British tracker and John Reilly as a World War 2 pilot. They do justice to their roles but somehow I felt they weren't really the best choices to don them. Samuel Jackson breezes through in a negative role. What I really liked was how many actors in the movie(the two teams that go in to discover the island) get well etched roles with a good dose of humor in the midst of the horror around them. The visuals of the island are beautifully captured and the effects are equally first rate. The good(Tom Hiddleston & team), the bad(Samuel Jackson & team) and the terrible(the beasts of the island) come together and give us our ticket's worth of entertainment(there may be plot holes but who cares?) Verdict - watch it for the humor, visuals & nearly 2 hours worth of man vs beast action.",8,2,3,13 October 2017
Wonder Woman," Yes to Gal Gadot, No to Wonder Woman
","I saw this movie a week ago and at the time, I was too impressed(a woman director, first female led superhero movie in a long time, lovely music, action..) to have any second thoughts. I wrote a very positive review and in the end, mentioned that I'd gladly pay a ticket for the sequel. But over the days since I posted the review, I have had uncomfortable thoughts about the script even if the movie has been very well made. It has a story based loosely on events around World War I or II and projects the Germans(of that era) as villains. Yes Germany in the early 1900s were the 'bad guys' like how maybe North Korea is looked upon today. It's a past that people want to forget, so it can feel uncomfortable for many who are natives of the country to see glimpses of their dark history show up on screen again, especially as an entertainment. Is this how a comic need to be? But then, Hollywood has, over the last many decades, made entertainment and profit from past misdeeds of other countries like the Vietnam, Russia, Iraq, North Korea or Afghanistan. It's ironic since in this movie, Wonder Woman accuses a character that he's into the war for profits. My dislike is just not about Wonder Woman really. I have had issues with the scripts of few other DC or Marvel movies released over the last few years(not to mention some of the violence shown) too.So although I score Wonder Woman high for sincere performances(Gal Gadot, Chris Pine and Robin Wright especially) and lot of technical hard work(music, visuals, effects, action or cinematography), I cannot recommend it unfortunately. I wonder even if I'd see a DC or Marvel movie again.",8,3,10,7 June 2017
Black Panther," Less of the Panther, More of His Toys...
","I had a huge expectation about this solo Black Panther movie after whatever little of him in Captain America - Civil War movie left me very impressed. I mean, that movie was the first time I got introduced to the Black Panther character and I was instantly bowled by his black suit, mask and how he fights(no guns or fancy gadgets, just his claws & kicks..). But with this solo venture, I didn't get to see him in a pure fight except for the intro encounter with some rogues in a forest. The action in the rest of the movie is more about his fancy gadgets, Spiderman like jumps or other visual effects show off. When I entered the theatre, Black Panther was my fav Marvel character. When I left, it ceased to be. That tells it all. They made him like the James Bond or the Iron Man of Wakanda with all the latest gadgets to save his a**! Black Panther's USP, I feel, is his hand to hand combats, kicks and ofcourse that suit that can take on anything earthly atleast. Making him fly around like Spiderman or use toys makes him no different from other Marvel or DC super heroes and one loses interest eventually.The movie is otherwise a decent entertainer especially the first half. There are lot of hilarious moments as well especially among the Panther and his sister Shuri or from the hugely built Mbaku, the chief of another tribe whom Panther fights for the throne. Among the performances, Chadwick Boseman fits into the Panther role very well. Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia, Panther's love is breathtakingly beautiful. Martin Freeman also makes his presence felt but somehow I think these kinda roles don't suit him at all or explore his potential the way the Hobbit did. My fav performance among the cast is from the brilliant Andy Serkis as the ruthless trader Ulysses Klaue. It's refreshing to see him perform purely as an actor for a movie than just prance around in a body suit. And finally the climax...well, I didn't stay back for the post credit scenes but it wouldn't have made me any less disappointed. Really the story could have done less with the technology in Wakanda or the glory of metal vibranium and more about the man T'Challa(the Black Panther), some realistic action and his emotional struggles to save his family or the world.Verdict - a nice entertainer but next time let the Panther hunt without his toys!",7,5,10,19 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Glad I Saw the First Star Wars Movie, Finally
","The first Star Wars I got to see were the ones made from the period 1999 to 2005. I saw them all. At the time I found them quite funny and didn't like as much as I assumed. Later, when Star Wars by JJ Abrahms came out in 2015, I saw it mainly 'cause I'm a fan of the director. It was good but again I wasn't impressed as much but now I realise that's because I didn't have any clue about who these major characters are like Luke Skywalker, Hans Solo, C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewie or Princess Leia. What prompted me to finally see A New Hope was the 2017 release starring Daisy Ridley. That movie was awesome and I decided to see the rest of the Star Wars I missed. Now, after A New Hope, I finally understood who these people are and also appreciate the passion of some of the veteran actors like Harrison Ford, the late Carrie Fisher & Mark Hamill when they came back nearly four decades later to be in the new sequels. The effects in this movie is still good for a 1977 movie. But more than the effects, I liked the story and there were many intense action scenes especially towards the end when the Rebel Alliance were hellbent on destroying the Empire's Death Star space station but closely pursued by Darth Vader & his army. Some of the action between the characters didn't convince but those were minor flaws in this otherwise first class thriller. Verdict: I'm glad I finally saw it. The force(entertainment) is strong on this one :)",8,4,5,20 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Yoda and Darth Vader Make the Movie Very Watchable
","Compared to the prequel A New Hope(1977), this movie has lesser action I felt, but some intense drama which still make it good entertainment. Some of the best scenes here involve the Yoda & Luke Skywalker and those between the latter & Darth Vader towards the end of the movie. There's some good action for sure but not as much as you'd have expected or hoped from a Star Wars movie. Not that I mind because I liked a lot of the conversation between the characters especially what Yoda says about the Force & how to use it to Luke Skywalker and when Darth Vader spills the beans on who he really is to Luke. Those scenes which had some emotional or spiritual touch to it almost gave me goosebumps. The performances are good especially from Mark Hamill as Luke. The only flaw I could think of here are some of the visual effects which stumbled a bit at places but still impressive enough.Verdict: a very watchable entertainer & sequel to the first Star Wars movie.",8,2,3,21 January 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," A Decent Entertainer of Fun, Gore & Horror
","Cabin in the Woods is like a horror comedy. There's lot of humor amidst some of the gore. It doesn't take itself seriously yet the horror is well done and the effects are first rate too. In a genre like this, one would expect lot of jump scare scenes but this movie doesn't offer much of that. Instead it offers a variety of hideous creatures, zombies or spooky beings(an army of nightmares..) and also nice suspense. The entertainment is especially towards the final scenes when all of these monsters go out on their bloodthirsty rampage. It was comical yet a satisfying feast of mutilation & slaughter :) But the gore is also not too graphic in my opinion, they keep a balance because I think the intent is to simply entertain at the end of the day. The cast performance is good especially by Fran Kranz as the constantly 'high' Marty. Wish there were more scenes of Thor, I mean Chris Hemsworth in this movie but does his support role well enough.The only flaws I could think of are the final scenes again. Although it was fun to watch all the monsters on the loose, it felt as though there were too much of these things running all over the place and that messed up the spook factor a bit. I also didn't like how it ends - how the 'ancient ones' reveal themselves in the end was a disappointment.Verdict - a typical slasher, horror movie that blends well with your popcorn & soda, don't expect too much that's all..",7,0,0,26 February 2018
Warcraft," Nice Fantasy Movie, Expected Better Action & Visuals
","The effects, the music and some of the characters like the orcs Durotan & Ogrim or even Garona(a half-orc) are what I like about the movie. The performances are good too but I feel there isn't any one act that I can single out because this movie is heavy on actors in body suits(the orcs) and also lot of effects. The action disappointed me however and it could be because all the fights seem to be happen within a very limited space or at least that's how it looked to me...they give out a visually cramped impression. Even the action choreography could have been better - nice but expected much more. The end hints a sequel so I hope that offers much more bang for the buck, both visually and the action or else, the part two or a three even could have a dismal run at the box office and compared unfairly with other fantasy movies like the hugely successful Hobbit or Lord of the Rings trilogies.",7,17,21,21 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," Far creepier than Prometheus, but Alien is still the Best
","After the Prometheus which though well made was bit of a disappointment due to less alien action, I found the sequel Alien Covenant to be a very good work and more scary too. The effects as expected are excellent and the performances too are impressive. We don't have to wait until the interval's over for the action to start. Once the alien(s) comes into the picture, the nightmare is quite relentless until the end yet thankfully, it isn't overly done either. There is a satisfyingly good mix of horror and drama. How it ends suggests another sequel the way Prometheus did which annoys me slightly. I'd prefer there is a completion to a story in a movie, irrespective of a sequel later or not. Katherine Waterston as the 'Ripley'(if I may say so) here does a neat job although Noomi Rapace in the Prometheus impressed me more. But the actor who's truly the life of the movie is Michael Fassbender as Walter/David. This is the first Alien movie where a male character seem to get the most footage, and Fassbender does his best. And is The Covenant Ridley's best alien work yet? Of course no, that is still the Alien(1979) by a mile. However The Covenant is still a very good entertainment.",8,59,114,12 May 2017
