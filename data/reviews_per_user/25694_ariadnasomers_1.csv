It," Deeply disappointed
","I won't give this movie a lower rating because I don't think it deserves it as a movie. As an adaptation, it would get a -5 at best. First of all, the kids. They are NOT amazing. They have no real chemistry, plus the unconditional friendship factor is absent. You never get the feel that they're supposed to be together to beat It. They fight and they're petty. They changed them so much, and quite unnecessarily. Bill is weak, Eddie is unbearable, Stan is hardly there at all. Why steal Mike's glory? He's supposed to be the history oriented one, not Ben. Why kill off his parents and make him kill livestock? He's barely in the movie. Why make Ben, a kid who has been in Derry for a month, the knowledgeable one? Just because he likes the library? Ugh. All the kids are different than what they're supposed to be. Also, no Barrens, no dam, no clubhouse. Stop comparing this to Stranger Things. That shows the camaraderie in 10 minutes, while this fails to show these kids as a unit. The bullies failed too. Except for the father killing scene, Henry Bowers was pathetic. The movie fails to show his descent into madness at It's hands completely. Pennywise is decent, but there's too much of it. You may have noticed the movie is called 'It', not 'Pennywise'. Far gone are all the things that scare the kids, there's only this clown and a leper that looks more like a zombie. WHY SAY GEORGIE WAS MISSING???? He was dead. His body was recovered. Actually, many children's bodies were recovered. The scene with them all floating was dumb. And don't get me started on Bev being kidnapped. That takes from the kids' courage to go and kill It, which they did by choice, and reduces it to a rescue mission that nobody wanted to take part of. The change to the 80's was terrible. Awful use of music and sound. They could learn a thing or two from Stranger Things in that department. Edition is terrible too. They could have earned the R rating with awesome death scenes, but they chose to waste it on language. If I have to mention positives, I'll say the CGI is far from being as terrible as they say. It works. Also, the initial Georgie scene is good. All the movie should have had that tone. If you've never read the book, the movie is average, thus the 5 stars. I really hope the adult part makes up for this, but I doubt it. There are many more things I could say, but I'd never finish. I'll just close with this: the miniseries was infinitely more faithful to the book than this.",5,2,3,1 November 2017
