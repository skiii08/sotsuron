Requiem for a Dream," The ultimate all-time-favorite
","Just amazing and perfect! The acting, directing, scenography, costumes, music, everything! The story of a dangerous path people take for love, attention and success. The story of fragile self-control, insecurities and ambition. The impact it has on the viewer is just stunning! One of those movies that grabs you to take a ride with it, one of those movies that makes you question your habits! I remember that I didn't smoke for a long time after watching this movie. Hands down to Darren Aronofsky, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Bursty, Marlon Wayns and, above all, Clint Mansell! Should definitely have a special place in the history of cinematography!",10,1,2,2 May 2020
