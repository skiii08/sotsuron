The Ring," Not very good...
","I didn't care too much for 'The Ring'.  I didn't find it scary in the least and fairly comedic at times when it wasn't intended to be (its pure slapstick when the horse jumps off the boat).  The plotline seems solid enough but it lacks any real depth.  The videotape in question origin is never explained, nor where it came from, only a horror story involving a child (which has become fairly cliche in psychological horror movies as of late).The supposed 'twist' at the end (which was supposedly more surprising than the one in 'The Sixth Sense') was bland and didn't warrant me going through and watching the movie again to appreciate the full magnitude of it, since there was no real magnitude to it whatsoever.I always liked movies that had an open-ended finale, but this was just idiotic.  The question 'How can we stop this tape from killing more people?' is essentially asked.  My response:  JUST DESTROY THE DAMN TAPE!!!  The special effects were admittedly very well done, especially in the final scene, but that's hardly reason to recommend so much as a rental of this. Don't waste your time.",3,0,2,12 March 2003
Minority Report," Awesome, simply awesome
","I thought I had seen the best sci-fi movie of my life with 'The Matrix'. Not anymore.  'Minority Report' has everything: special effects, suspense, mystery, action, storyline, twists...I could go on and on about this film and laud all kinds of praise upon it but I'd rather you just get on with it and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  Even if you're not into sci-fi, you'll get so engrossed in this its incredible.  Even if you don't like the premise, the actors, whatever, you won't be sorry.  Trust me!!",10,1,3,12 March 2003
Ocean's Twelve," Convoluted to the point of ridiculousness...
","Ocean's Twelve isn't so much a movie as it is an opportunity for the majority of the actors involved to mirror their own predominant personal behavior: pretentiousness. The 'coolness' of Ocean's Eleven, prevalently displayed in the previews for the movie, turned me off to it, but I saw it at a friend's after it was released on video and ended up liking it very much. This brand of 'coolness' is irritating and confusing, and though the movie can be entertaining, there are far too many subplots for us to care (or most times understand) what is occurring. The major heist involved here is clever and the dialog can be very entertaining at times, but the majority of the movie still feels like a stranger's conversation in which we are just observers. The backstories of many events are shown after the scene in which it would be essential to comprehend, and while this may seem like an original cinematic twist, it just doesn't flow.Simply put, the movie has little of the original, tightly packed feel of Ocean's Eleven. Most everything goes wrong for the crew this time around, whereas they had an almost perfect heist in the first movie. It's an interesting switch, but it dramatically hurts the pace of the movie. I didn't dislike the movie as a whole, but I didn't particularly enjoy it either.",5,1,3,1 August 2005
Scary Movie 2," Someone remind me why I wasted 99 cents on this??!
","Wow, as bad as 'Scary Movie' was, I didn't expect it could get much worse. 'Scary Movie 2' is exponentially worse, though there is something to be said for utter stupidity with no clever humor involved whatsoever.  I just can't remember what it is at this moment...If you hated Beverly Hills 90210, however, you'll get to see Tori Spelling in one of her finest roles yet:  cheap ho for a polergeist.",1,5,10,12 March 2003
