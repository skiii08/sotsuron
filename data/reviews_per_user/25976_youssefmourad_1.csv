First Man," Damien Chazelle is cinema's long lost son who once left to seek perfection and never came back.
","Chazelle's 'First Man' is an absolute cinematic masterpiece that can be labeled as 'Oscar Material'First of all.. Acting :
Ryan Gosling nailed it as Neil Armstrong, I haven't seen Ryan this good so far.. He impersonated NEIL so well and showed all his sides so well that sometimes I felt I see the real Armstrong in front of me.
Claire Foy, what can I say? I saw her in' The Crown' TV series and she was great,.. But this! Breathtakingly outstanding performance as Jane Armstrong and she must be expecting some respectable awards for this role.
Great Displays from the rest of the acting cast specially Jason Clarke.. A big 'Chapeau' for the casting crew.Cinematography:
Academy award winner- Linus Sandgren
When I saw Sandgren's work in LA LA Land, I thought that's is the best work that he can ever do, and actually he won an Oscar for it, but today after I watched First Man he changed my mind, this guy still has a lot to offer.A great thank you for Art Directing, Sound Mixing, Screenplay and special Thanks for the Editor.Directing :
Today I can proudly say, Damien Chazelle is the legitimate heir to The cinematic directing Throne.
Damien's Rythm, Vision, Control, Sense were above everything.
You can see Damien's talent in every shot in the movie, also he was the reason this movie wasn't just a space travel movie, it was a leap inside human beings and how can life affects them whether here.. Or on the Moon.
