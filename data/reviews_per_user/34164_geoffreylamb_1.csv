Changeling," Prepare to enjoy
","Clint Eastwood has done it again. A marvelous story , well acted by all. If you like slow burning, story building with a proper ending. Well this movie is for you. It is probably 98% 30's LA which is good enough for me.Ms Jolie played her part extremely well along with all the young cast, although the bad guy might of been a small bit more creepy. Having said that it was not all about him , but about the emotional journey ridden by a mother who doesn't know which way to turn. There are questions answered some not answerd,however the unanswerd questions keep the movie charged.There is a good mix of good cop bad cop and knight in shining armour, good friends bad friends. It is defenatly a roller coaster of a journey to be fulfilled and enjoyed by all who can appreciate a good story",9,3,4,4 March 2009
