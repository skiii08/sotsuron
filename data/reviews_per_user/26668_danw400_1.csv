Requiem for a Dream," over-editing
","Well, i saw this movie and was rather disappointed.  In my opinion, it was gruesomely over-edited with that snappy 'MTV-style' (i hate the way MTV does it too) editing, flashing all about.  It really makes me think my attention span was too long for this movie... I understand why he (when I use he, I'm referring to the director) was doing it like this, to create a feeling of anxiety and intensity, but like many things, its WAY overdone.  He certainly had good intentions, 'drugs are bad' and all that, but the way he did it kind of felt blunt and cold like a drugs class at school. I couldn't really relate personally with the sorrows of the main characters, and most of the arguments he presents seem to argue more for legalization of drugs than not doing them.  It seems that most of their problems would have been solved merely by a more accepting open-minded societal outlook towards drugs, and just not being stupid.  (trying not to point out any spoilers...) For example, the lady taking drugs to lose weight? was she out of her mind? not to mention her gradually stepping up the dosage.  As with what happens to her son, i knew what they problem was the minute i saw it, and knew the consequences if he soon didnt get it fixed from that point early in the movie.  The one good point I'd really like to point out is how they dont really distinguish between legal and illegal drugs, as with the lady popping pills that her doctor gave her, anything in moderation wont hurt you, and anything abused will, despite whether or not your doctor recommends it to you.  I've known some people in my time who have become pretty messed up on perfectly legal drugs, and they dont even really exceed the dosage (to my knowledge).  There's not a miracle pill cure for everything, but our society seems to think there is, so pop the pill and everything will be better...Anyways, I'm off track, point is, the motives were clear, the message wasn't, and the editing gave me a headache, i gave it a 3/10.",3,6,13,29 August 2002
