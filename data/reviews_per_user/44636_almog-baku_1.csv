The Avengers," the MOST BORING movie!
","Congratulations! This is THE MOST BORING movie I ever seen in my whole life.I require for a refund. I waste 3 hours and 25$ for this awful movie. Next time please turn off the music so I could sleep as well.----- I waste my time at this movie. At the first time I get up at the middle of the movie and leave the cinema. I've really tried to sleep but the should was too loud, and the movie has no really a plot.The basic plot is simple, alien come to America(as usual) he trying to destroy the world(WOW! surprising!), the army is fail(I think I've already say USUAL?), and they save the world by the power of friendship... BORING!!..So if that's so simple.. why does its take 3 hours?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!I really can't believe i said it.. but- I REQUIRE FOR A REFUND!",1,26,72,16 May 2012
