Blade Runner 2049," I believe this movie needed a sequel as much as I believe Donald trump is going to take care of the poor
","Give me a break. The Tyrell corporation has gone bankrupt and its work been banned, but another corporation is doing the same at a larger scale!The world is for the destitute and desperate, but people are living in palatial casinos all alone drinking Black Label and have a cute dog for a company. The escorts are sexy cuties and the hologram girlfriends are sweet perfect tens. There is apparently no lack of drinks or food either.Then these guys have the temerity to have an ending where nothing is resolved and we will have to pay for another six sequels probably soon.Ridley and Ford need to see a shrink and work through their addiction to sequels and remakes. I am not paying for any more of these. They can release another six Aliens, Star Wars, Captain Americas and Avengers 9and yes so-called Blade Runners) but I am done. This is good-bye.",2,7,14,15 October 2017
Alien: Covenant," A Film For Gullible Idiots (Maybe Trump Groupies Will Love It?)
",This film is made for mental retards.On a mission to colonize a pre-selected planet an interstellar ship (imagine how much training and money went into that) runs into trouble and hears a John Denver song. What does this crew of intelligent hand picked geniuses do? Divert the mission to go check it out. Once landed do they have protective gear or bio suites? Of course not. When they see an alien ship what do they do? They hop skip and run into it and then when one of them is ill bring him back into the shuttle and contaminate the whole thing...I give up.,2,4,7,15 October 2017
