The Blair Witch Project," Stupid!
","The Blair Witch Project was one of the stupidest movies I've seen this year. That was supposed to be scary? I've heard stories about people who were afraid to be by themselves after seeing that movie. I didn't get it. It was boring, the longest 89 minutes. The characters were annoying and inconsistent. I was rooting for the Witch to get them.I was glad when the movie was finally over. All I got out of the movie was nausea from all those shaky camera movements.",Null,1,2,20 September 1999
