Hereditary," Left Dissapointed
",Very creepy film . started really well and continued to do so until the final 10 minutes.Sadly the ending was terrible. Even laughable. This film could have been very good.,6,2,4,22 August 2018
The Irishman," Give me my 4 hours back!!!
","If you rate this over 5 then you are puddled.
Is the slowest most boring film ever seen. Nothing happens.
If it wasn't for the cast who are class, I would have rated it less.
Don't bother.",4,4,10,19 December 2019
A Quiet Place," Heart still racing 2 hours after seeing film!
","Probably the most tense film I have ever seen. From start to finish you are on the edge of your seat. What a rollercoaster. Acting is fantastic and the drama is just intense. 
Great job John and Emily!",9,1,2,17 April 2018
Joker," I need a spa day after that!
","Intense, brutal and heartbreaking!
Oscar in the bag 🏆
Enough said.",8,1,2,5 October 2019
