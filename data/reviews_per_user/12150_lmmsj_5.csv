The Benchwarmers," Absolutely hilarious
","I laughed so hard at this movie that I thought at one time I was going to throw up. It was funny, and the characters were awesome. I think that Rob Schneider's wasn't all that funny but the others were hilarious, especially Howie, the agoraphobic who thinks the 'sun is bad'. I love the salad bowl mullet hair cuts of David spade and his brother, Howie. Jon Heder did a few things reminiscent of Napoleon Dynamite and that was a welcome treat. Also, Jon Lovitz was funny as the dork who grew up to be a BIll Gates style rich dude who has all the toys and the last laugh to those that teased him when he was younger. The other hysterical part is the little guy, Marcus Ellwood who plays the bullied little kid who as an adult lives in his mother's basement in a 'peanut butter fortress' and casts spells on people. Let's also not forget the cameo of Reggie Jackson, who says he is going to train them like he learned....running, catching and hitting which equates to : ding dong ditch, playing hot potato with a real hot potato and taking mailboxes out with a baseball during drive by. At one point the opposing team tries to get an adult on their roster to play against the bench warmers and his ID constitutes a Polaroid picture taped to a piece of paper with green crayon written..'I am 12'. I laughed so hard at this movie, I had tears in my eyes. While, not the best movie I have ever seen, it was definitely the funnest, and the most likable that I have seen in a long time.",10,1,3,12 April 2006
Pacific Rim," OMG I love this movie
",I had a lot of fun at this movie. I think that the special effects were awesome and that the story line was good. Charlie Day was fabulous and hilarious and the other actors were pretty good. Thank you for bringing back the fun and memories of blockbuster monster movies like Godzilla and some of the old time greats!!! Fun for the entire family!! It's been along time since I have seen a movie that was not only visually striking but also made me feel like the admission price was well spent. I look forward to any sequels that this movie will spawn. Hopefully they will find a great storyline to continue the fun and bring another great movie full of fabulous special effects!! Highly recommend!!!,10,6,11,28 July 2013
Saw III," missing pieces
","On the whole, I enjoyed the movie, but there were certain things I did not understand and now may have to go back and rent 1 and 2 again to see what I missed. When Jigsaw is in and out of consciousness, he has visions of a blonde woman...who is this? Is this his wife? When he is saying, I love you...I love you...and he is directing this at Lynn the doctor, is Amanda jealous? What was in the envelop that Jigsaw gave Amanda? I thought maybe it was his will? In the end, did Jigsaw or Amanda kill Det. Matthews. The info on this saw 3 say that the guy who played the judge was also in the 2nd one...where? I don't understand what the guy with the chains had to do with it. I understand everyone else related to the killing of Jeff's son and his need for forgiveness/vengeance testing..but some of it I don't understand.",6,0,2,1 November 2006
Casino Royale," Horrible....no flow at all
","When the movie first starts, you think that it is something of a terrorist plot with the code name of ellipse and the constant chase scene from one place to another. The stunt work is fabulous and I have to admit I have never seen anything quite like it, but then the story makes no sense. We are not told why he is after the frenchman to start with. We think we are following the plot at the airport when all of the sudden we are taken elsewhere to the casino with no apparent idea of why he is in this game. The frenchman loses all the money on the stock market on purpose?? and then he plays in a high stakes poker game. Also, the gianni character..mathis..he is completely out of place. We don't know what he is supposed to be doing. Also if the boy friend of vesper is being held for ransom, and she is a high level British government worker from the treasury representing the money factor, don't you think they would know about her background? She would have to have some type of security clearance and she already had access to the money so why would she go through the charade of having to play the part at the poker game. I was very disappointed and I have to say it was the worst bond film yet.",1,18,32,4 December 2006
Valkyrie," Surprisingly a great movie
","I don't know where to begin. When I first heard the movie was coming out, I had a lot of interest in it, but as soon as I heard Tom Cruise was going to be headlining, I was less than enthralled. After seeing a trailer for it during one of the earlier movies this year, I was impressed with what I saw for the sneak peeks, and Tom Cruise seemed okay so far. I took my children (15, 18) to see it last night and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movies really is. I was very impressed with the star studded ensemble, but especially with Bill Nighy..wonderful. Thomas Kretschmann was awesome too, as the Germany Army Major who is confused at whether or not all of the alerts are real or drills. The script is wonderful, the direction is great and the cinematography is superb. Any fan of WW2 history will surely love this movie.",8,6,9,31 December 2008
