Skyfall," Good, but not that much...
","This review may contain some spoilers, not that I think they can be any disturbing.The movie was not that bad. The performance of Javier Bardem was one more time impressive, as you can't tell the similarities between this and his other characters. Bond wasn't in his perfect shape, which demonstrate some loyalty to the old Bond of the books (a person who smokes 60 cigarettes per day can't be in shape, right?), specially after the first scenes emphasizing his alcohol addiction. The plot was good, not astonishing, but OK, whereas three really important things missed in my point of view. 1) there wasn't much attention given to exotic places. Turkey was shown in its worst scenario ever and there were nothing at all like in the old Bond movies; 2) there wasn't almost any involvement with the actresses, too quick, no story...; 3) there was no games! Bond arrived at the casino and just took the suitcase full of money. One can say that some of the most exciting parts of previous films were behind the games of Poker, Baccarat, and so on... To sum up, this was a not-so-bad Bond movie, although I might state that this was the worst Bond movie of all time. There was a good amount of action and some characters were brought back to the scenes, like the old Aston Martin DB5 and Miss MoneyPenny. For those who only watched the two last Bond movies, it might seem to be OK... Unfortunately, it seems the director forgot some essential elements for the old fans, but, of course, in my point of view...",7,7,17,26 October 2012
