United 93," Superbly put together
","Greetings from the UK , watched this film didn't know what to expect at first but was well portrayed by actors showing what really happened on this flight and that dreadful day we will never forget , the people on this flight showed their bravery and guts whilst living in fear of their lives they knew they had to react and did but these terrorists cowards took the easy way out , my thoughts go out to the people on this flight who will rest in peace feeling proud of themselves knowing they had the guts and balls in a relatively helpless situation also thoughts to everyone else who lost their lives on 9/11 and the families and friends , anyway superbly put together film and worth watching lots of love to everyone from here in sunny UK.",10,0,3,21 May 2006
