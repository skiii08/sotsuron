Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Okay at best
","It's sad that out of all the people that pitch movies to production executives, the ones that get made are generally storylines that are incredibly predictable and boring.  When I saw that they were making a prequel to Star Wars I expected great things.  I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, but I enjoy a great film, so I decided to see it.Unfortunately, I found it like most of the new movies I end up seeing- predictable and boring.  I felt they spent too much time at Tatooine, and too much time with the pod racing.  I feel as if I need a trademarked or copyright after pod racing since the whole marketing plan of the film was based off of this sequence.  Everywhere I turned in a store was pod racing this and pod racing that.My largest complaint is the fact that the whole movie was done on a computer.  Computer generated graphics to enhance a fighting scene or an explosion is one thing, but to use computers to generate whole scenes and characters is not right.I think the film would've been much more effective if they shot it with a little more than the story of Star Wars in mind.  They should've used the filming techniques like they did when filming Star Wars, using their wits instead of a computer.  For example, filming the flights passed the Death Star was done by building many, many model battleships together and driving by with a camera.  The point I am getting at is that putting the prequel next to the original looks funny.The Phantom Menace was okay at best.  It was not a 'wait in line for weeks to see it' good (no film is that good anyway), but it was a decent movie. It barely held my interest, especially during the pod racing scene.  I found little entertainment in it, I found the most entertainment in the light saber scene with Darth Maul at the end.  It was an okay film, nothing to brag about, but nothing to put down either.",Null,0,1,23 November 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the best Action/Adventure movies of all-time.
","If adventure has a name...it must be Indiana Jones. That line says it right there. The contrast between this movie and all of the heros before it was that Indy was human. He gets hurt, unlike his predecessor James Bond. With whip and revolver in hand, Indiana was an exotic hero. Indy was sofisticated (a college professor), he was handsome and adventurous. Harrison Ford was liked by all audiences, women found him attractive, men found him daring. Qualities found in Brittish spy, James Bond. Most people know now that Steven Spielberg was denied the directors position for a 007 film. He teamed up with George Lucas to make an American hero- Indiana Jones. There are many parallels between the two characters, but I'm not going to get into that. Another thing that made Raiders great was the plot itself. An archeologist travels around the world to find the Ark of the Covenant- the ark that contained the 10 Commandments and was said to have special powers. Indy gets entangled with a rival French archeologist who is working with the Nazis. An amazing story which keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire time. What keeps you there is not just the plot or action sequences, it is also the score by John Williams. Some of the best soundtracks are from John Williams (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman). This adrenaline-pumping score of the Raiders March makes you wish you had a theme song everytime you walked into a room. This is a great movie, it should be seen by anyone who enjoys a good adventure.",1,3,67,23 February 2001
