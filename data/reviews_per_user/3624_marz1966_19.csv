The Blair Witch Project," oh look,a twig and a pile of rocks.so scared.so very scared.
","I am sorry.This movie wasn't what I was hoping it would be.'Scarier than the Exorcist' is one of the comments that I had heard,but it failed to even live up to such a remark. What's so scary??!!Just a three city kids lost in the woods.I think it would have been a better movie if there was a script and we did see the witch,then again maybe not.Too many colorful metaphors for my tastes,yet I do believe that the young gentlemen and lady did good in there acting. I would love to see them in something else besides this garbage!Don't bother watching.Well, maybe if you have absolutely nothing to do...",Null,0,1,31 July 2000
Training Day," A must see film
","Once in awhile, a film comes along and totally catches you off guard. Training day,is one of those films. I just had expected a typical bad cop film or something of that nature,but my friends, it wasn't. Denzel Washington has proven, once again, that he is one of the finest actors of his generation. His character,Alonzo,a highly decorated officer of the l.a.p.d.,is charming,street wise,cunning,and dangerous. Now, some actors would have made this guy just a bad ass cop.Heartless.However Denzel gave him a just the right amount of humanity(there's a scene with his son,that briefly gives you a glimpse of that aspect.)where there might be a heart deep within the beast. Ethan.My god. He is wonderful in this film.Playing this first day on the job,fish out of water,and some times confused cop,you see why he,along with Washington, was nominated for the oscar this year. I watched this on DVD and after seeing the deleted and alternate ending of the film, I have to give kudos to the director,Antoine Fuqua. It was very wise to leave out some of those scenes...but at the same time, you got the feeling it was true what the character,Alonzo frequently tells the young det.Hoyt(Hawke),'you remind me of me'. Training day is a must see film that may shock and surprize you. It really made me wonder,how widespread is the corruption in the police. Must they,as in the film shows,be criminals to catch crimals??God help us all. See the film. You will not regret it.",10,8,19,23 March 2002
Meet the Parents," Three words:Funny,Funny,Funny!
","I just saw this movie last night with my wife and I must tell you guys,it was hilarious! Ben Stiller and the reliable Robert DeNiro are excellent. A good story and solid acting. Haven't had this much fun in a movie since,'Austin Powers:the spy who shagged Me.'Of course,it was Jay Roach who directed this instant treasure. A definite must see!!!!",9,0,0,21 October 2000
X-Men," eXcellent Movie!!
","I just finished watching the x-men movie and was blown away by it!!!Kudos to Bryan Singer for doing such a wonderful job!!!Once again,Mr.S has showed the world what a gifted man he truly is by presenting to us such a fanstastic comic book adaption!The person who I really was impressed with was Hugh Jackman(Logan/Wolverine).He is a very good actor and to be honest,I can't wait to see him portraying another character in a different movie.He's the one to watch! Patrick Stewart(Professor X) and Sir Ian Mckellan(Magneto) were,of course at their usual best.James Marsden(Cyclops) did a fine job as well.Framke Jenssen(Jean Grey),Halle'Honey'Berry(Storm)were perfect although I did wish they gave girlfriend(berry)some more lines.It's cool,she'll get them next time!I loved everything about this movie!Mystique(meeeyowww!)and Wolvie fight scene was one of the best that I've seen!Check this movie out.I think that it will appeal to both fanboys and non-comic book fans alike!!Thanks bryan for your hard work!!",9,0,0,16 July 2000
Milk," An amazing film
","An excellent film.I was taken aback by how WELL written this picture is.Diaglouge is excellent topped off by Sean Penn's Oscar winning performance.wow.However,I think an actor excels to greatness by the surrounding cast(all fantastic) and a director who guides and brings out the best in them all. I never knew much about Harvey Milk until this film.I mean,I know OF him.I was in California when he was assinated by Dan white but this film enlightened me so much to his life. It made me look beyond his sexuality. He was a caring and loving man that wanted basically equal rights for all. This film is something that everyone should see.It gives hope and in these crazy uncertain times we live in now,we need as much of that as possible.",10,0,2,9 January 2010
Lost in Translation," Lost in translation:Jet lag and alcohol
","I was fortunate enough to see this incredible film recently and I must say I was awe struck. There are many who have commented that they didn't see what the big deal about this picture. Well,everyone is entitled to there opinions,but I do encourage all to see this celluloid classic.This is not your typical hollywood romantic comedy. No,sir!It's deep and speaks in unheard volumes. Sofia Coppola scores a direct hit in capturing the subtle nuances that we all experience in our daily lives. I love how she tells the story through the camera as we follow Scarlett Johansens's recently married character leading a somewhat lost and mundane existance in a far away mystical place called Tokyo! Bill Murray plays with perfection,an actor who has been in the business and married for years and is perhaps facing a mid life crisis of sorts.These two lost souls find each other in a foreign land. They both see a bit of themselves in each other but at different stages of life. They both obviously are outsiders and that just makes them more endearing and empathic to each other.I loved this film. It was real. The ending,which some may not like,is to me,the most impacting to me. A whisper of a shared secret that no one else knows will make us,the audience, wonder for years what had been said.See this movie.Relax.Take in the beauty and great acting of Lost In Translation.",10,0,1,15 February 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," an unexpected gem...(some spoilers,mates.)
","Ok. I will be the first person to admit that I really didn't expect much from this film. In Fact, I did all what I could to get out of seeing it.(Faking colds,financially challenged,I have an impending surgery..etc.) But I must thank my wife for her tenaciousness and curse the creators of the video tapes..With a big all encompassing grin on her face and video in hand, I knew the jig was up,as it were..... Well,from the beginning,this wonderfully enchanting film had me. Renee Zellweger's Bridget is a happy go lucky single woman in her early thrities who is in search of true love(hoping to avoid all the 'commitment phobic' blokes that she often falls for)and a slimmer waist line. I immediately fell in love with Renee's almost flawless performance in this picture. She,at least to me,took control of this character and breathed life into it. She made me care for Bridget as if she was one of my own friends,who was going through life's ups and constant downs. This is an oscar worthy performance by Zellweger.It seemed like it was tailor made for her. Written by Helen Fielding,Andrew Davies,and Richard Curtis(who wrote some stuff for Mr.Bean as well as the movie)this movie takes through the times and trials of Bridget Jones.All involved in this picture did a splendid job. Colin Firth, who sometimes plays a bit of jerk in films,does a great job playing the rather stiff but honorable,Mark Darcy...The movie,at first,makes him out to be rather a snotty sonofagun,but as it progresses,we see that's not the case. Hugh Grant,plays Bridget's wolf in sheep's clothing,boss,Daniel Cleaver. He is very effective as this womanizer that gets his claws into our dear Bridget,but fear not....all turns out well in the end. This movie was a real unexpected gem. It's not just a 'chick flick'.It's about accepting yourself and others.About making changes in your life,for yourself,and not for anyone else.Having good friends who love you,just as you are. It's a great film.Don't pass it up.",10,1,1,4 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Film Fantastic....
","This movie,directed by Peter Jackson,had me from the it's beginning!! I was held captive by it's beautiful cinematography and set design. The little Hobbit village was all that I had hoped it would be. Kudos to the casting Ian McKellan IS Gandalf!Everyone did a great job! I was one an emotional roller coaster with this first installment of the lord of the rings trilogy! If this doesn't inspire a new generation of readers of the books written by Tolkein,then I don't know what will. I whole heartedly encourage all to see this movie because you are in for a treat!The movie is about 3hrs long but you don't feel it all!The action sequences where excellent although at times the camera work was a bit to jerky to follow things,but other than...AWESOME! Special effects were breath-taking. At times,it was hard to distinguish the CGI from the real thing and in my opinion,that's incredible!! So,what are you reading this review?!!You're wasting time!Go see this film on the silver screen where it belongs!You won't regret it!!",10,0,0,25 December 2001
Man of Steel," Man of MEH......spoilers
","OK. So just finished seeing Zack Snyder's 'Man of Steel' and over all, I found it rather slightly underwhelming.Let me break it down like this:The GOOD- Casting. Kudos to the makers of the film for choosing Henry Cavill for the archetype of the super hero. I think he did really good, capturing the essence of Clark Kent/ Kal-EL. One of the coolest things about 'Man of Tomorrow' character, is his strength of COMPASSION, which Cavill, to his credit succeed in showing. I did enjoy Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon, as Jor-EL and General Zod, respectively. Very good indeed...BUT I really think they got MA and PA KEnt RIGHT. God Bless you Kevin Costner and Diane Lane. You were as I had hoped and envisioned the parents of the big blue boy scout would be. The love,care,and fear so genuinely portrayed by these two talented just hits the mark in my honest opinion. Their parts,are brief,but memorable. I enjoyed the different take on the technology of Krypton and the culture. That was kind of cool. The special effects were impressive.The BAD:THE SCRIPT....oh boy. I don't know. It was kinda light and not fulfilling,which is a bit of a surprise from David S.Goyer. I usually enjoy his work. Lack of chemistry between the very talented Amy Adams and Cavill. I just didn't FEEL it. Kinda stiff and forced.I didn't appreciate that*spoiler* LOIS FINDS OUT CLARK IS SUPERMAN!! I mean What THE HELL?!!! That was kinda of the fun part and mystique with Supes! True Superman fans will know what I mean. The fight scenes. WELLLLL...they were good but I found them rather drawn out and tiresome. Hey, I know our beloved man o'steel can kick some major ass and that he has GOD LEVEL super strength and what not..but I don't know. I think I just got tired of he and the other Kryptonians hitting each other through building after building. Structure after structure. ETC.I just felt,too,that they played this movie a wee bit to heavy on the dramatic side. I mean, maybe just a little bit more humor to lighten things up a bit? and FINALLY Zack Snyder. I know that he has a lot of respect for the source of the material for these types of films. I think he did great with films 300 and THE WATCHMEN! However, I don't know. I think he excels at doing more extraordinary humans than SUPERHUMAN if that makes any sense.Now, this film was way better than Superman Returns but nowhere NEAR as good as one of the BEST comic book adaptations EVER, 'Superman, the movie'.They did it right and after 30 something odd years, it STILL is a good time.Man of STEEL isn't a HORRIBLE film..just mediocre",6,2,4,15 June 2013
American Beauty," An American Classic!
","American Beauty is a modern classic.It makes you appreciate that there can be beauty found in almost anything.The entire cast of this movie is Excellent!If you aren't a Kevin Spacey fan before seeing this film,you will be one after it!It has such lovely powerful scenes, that it overwhelmed my senses.I must go back and see it again,so I can swallow them,a piece at a time...See this movie and be forever touched by the world around you.",10,0,0,31 October 1999
Spider-Man," The AMAZING spider-man!'Nuff SAID!
","I have just seen one of THE best comic book adaptation movie...ever! That's right. I said it. Sam Raimi and company have sucessfully translated the 40 year old comic super-hero,Spider-Man,into what I hope to be the STANDARD of comic adaptation films. Raimi balances drama,action,humor,and romance perfectly in this film. Tobey Maguire was the best choice as Peter Parker. He is excellent. He doesn't over or underplay this part. This role will forever be his and no one elses.EVER. Kristen Dunst? With what they gave her,once again,she delivers. We see Mary Jane's fears and insecurites..but in the end how she learns that she doesn't need a man to give her an identity. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin gives us a deliciously evil schizo villian. There is one scene when he and the 'Goblin' are having a discussion...chillingly convincing. The special effects were good,but yes,there are times where you can tell it's total CGI. Yet, the story,the action(some of the best and kind of brutal fight sequences I've seen in a comic book flick.) and,listen up you hollywood big shots,CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT, made it forgivable. Elfman's score was good,but what is kind of distrubing,is that it sounds like the REST of his stuff.(Unlike the music he did for a Simple Plan.) Spidey fans,for the most part, will love this movie. Yes, there are a few things that could have been better..but hey, it could have been a lot worst too. I can't wait for the sequel. We got the origin story out of the way now come 2004...let's get into the GOOOd stuff!!!SEE THIS MOVIE.....and be AMAZED.",10,0,0,3 May 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Magic,Mythic and Magnificent...
","I saw this movie just yesterday and still I am in awe of this masterpiece of film making. Ang Lee has out done himself with this marvelous piece of art. It contained so much.(romance,action,and comedy)There was a tale of unspoken love between the characters.Michelle Yeoh and Chow Fat are outstanding. The fight scenes were breathtaking.The choreography was fluid and beautiful to behold. I was really taken aback by the scenery!Two Thumbs up to the ciminophotographer. This is a difinite most see film that is oscar worthy on all counts. An intellingent story that has two very important lessons:'If you love someone,tell them.' and second,'With great power,comes great responsibility.'...This is a movie that is destined to be a classic.",10,0,0,22 January 2001
Velvet Goldmine," still ill...
","I think of myself as a person with an open mind and usually when I comment on a movie here on IMDB it's usually because I was so emotionally moved by the efforts of the cast and crew of the film.However,Velvet Goldmine was just an unfortunate waste of good talent(Ewan M.,Toni,and Eddie)and time. I felt that the writer(who happens to be the director of this film)was trying to make this film like some 'Glam'orized version of the classic,'Citizen Kane',but it fell flat on its face. I will give the movie these few good points:some clever visual work,music,and it was able to capture the very essence of the glam movement of the early 70's. That was well done. I can't help but get the feeling that the two main characters of the movie were loosely based on former glam star icons,David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Alas,if it this movie were a biopic of those two maybe I wouldn't feel so ill.",Null,0,2,23 November 1999

Moulin Rouge!," intoxicatingly wonderful...
","Moulin Rouge. When I had first heard that Nicole Kidman was going to be in this flick, I thought ok...what?She going to sing too?!Ridiculous.Well shut my mouth and call me Doofus McDoorknob!She was actually quite good.Ewan, I knew had the vocal skills(Check out Velvet Goldmine),so I didn't worry at all. This film is about the thing we all want so much in our lives:LOVE! It is a wonderful film which incorporates great songs of the 20th century to tell the most familiar tale, that most of us have seen throughout celluloid history but it does so with such vigor,verve, and colorful passion. My hats of to the director. The whole movie's visuals give you,well at leasts me,of how it is to be in love with THE one.You know,the special person that everytime you see he/she and there are fireworks and electricity!It's how we want and hope so much that how real and true love is. Everyone involved in the making of this lovely gem, should be praised. Now,there are no in betweens with this picture. Either you will love it or hate it. I loved it. See it and experience the fantastic......",9,0,0,30 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," It's never as good as the first time...
","Well, I just saw MI:2 and I must say that it pails in comparison to the first. It kinda dragged in the beginning. I mean, guys, I know how cool Tom Cruise is and am very much aware of his sexual proweness,but c'mon! I wanted it to start off with a bang! Instead, we are given something half baked. The dialouge was very weak and there are some major holes in the plot.Predictable.Predictable.Predictable. The cast was good. They were a handsome and effective bunch. Dougray Scott was very impressive as the movie's villian, but he was weighed down by a bad script. The other thing that kind of made me upset, was that they took a lot from the movie Darkman!Those who are fans of the movie will pick up on this right away. The best thing I can say about this picture are the action sequences! Nobody does it better than John Woo! They were well staged and executed! If you are going to see this movie, may I recommend that you see a matinee showing! You won't feel like you were robbed at least.",5,0,0,25 May 2000
The Dark Knight," a Great film
","Yesterday, I went to see 'The Dark Kight'. I think I'm in agreement with most of the IMDb users,that this film a masterpiece. Bale,Eckhardt,oldman,jake's sister(I won't even attempt spell it.lol) and caine,deliver solid performances! HEATH,God bless 'em,was remarkable. He completely submerges himself in this role. I don't think anyone will remember Jack Nicholson's joker,after getting a taste of Heath's.YE GODS.The story was compelling. I look forward to more. I'm glad that incorporated more of batman's DETECTIVE skills in this one too.OK,now my complaints: 1)The film kinda slowed down a bit for me. When dealing with dark themes,when the action isn't there,sheesh..DRAAAAAAAAAG. I started to nod off. It was like coming down off one of those energy drinks.CRASH.2)The fight scenes. Hmm.I don't know,could just be me,but the whole quick cuts and such..meh. I wish that they would have used the guys who choreographed the bourne movies!AGain.just my opinion.With that said,it's a great film. There's been talk about this being the best comic book adaptation movie,EVER.Hmmmmm...wouldn't say that. Definitely in the top 3,that's for sure.",9,0,3,20 July 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," eternal joy,eternal bliss,and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.
","Oh,God bless Charles Kaufman. Once again this man,who is gifted shares with us,again his creative genius...You must see this film:EVERYTHING is good about it..EVERYONE is wonderful in it..I think THIS is Jim Carrey's finest role to date!THIS man totally erases every pass thing that he did. Kate,Kristen,Tom Wilkson,and the rest are a complete wonderful emsamble to this unique and visually spectacular film..A mixture of comedy,romance,drama,and FATE makes this film a treasure.There are such cool hauntingly beatiful moments in this film that only Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet can pull off....I won't tell you anymore..but trust. You wil be amazed. SEE IT,LIVE IT,and LOVE IT.",10,0,2,11 April 2004

","There are not enough words to describe this extraordinary film, but I will try. I saw this film back in January of this year and I still find myself getting all teary-eyed whenever I see the ads or just talking about it!This film moved me!It had romance, it had comedy,it had drama,and suspense! Roberto changed my entire view of foreign films and made me fall in love with movies all over again! I am so happy that he won!If you have not seen this film, please do so!It will make you appreciate the splendor and beauty of life!How precious it is...",10,1,2,23 March 1999
