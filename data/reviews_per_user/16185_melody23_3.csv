Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," One of the best films I've seen in many years
","You will have to bring your brain to enjoy this movie. It doesn't talk down to the audience. It doesn't cheat the audience. And anyone who thinks it's anything less than a work of art didn't see the movie I saw from my perspective. I detested Dark Shadows, the last film from this producer/writer duo, but if they spewed out that to get to this, they are forgiven.Benjamin Walker is superb in this. He's as big as he needs to be to encompass the metaphor. As one might surmise, this isn't about vampires. It's not about the Civil War. It isn't even about Lincoln as much as it is about the moment in time he represents. In fact, the last few scenes clue us in that the director/writer believes the war is still going on, and I agree with them. I simply adore this film. Yes, it's violent, but it's not as bloody as it might have been. It is also pitch perfect. If they had gone one degree more in any direction, this film might have been howlingly silly, but if you're bright enough to get what the director and writer are getting at, I think you'll love it. Benjamin Walker is now one of my favorite actors, and I've only seen him in this The rest of the performances -- as well as the casting -- are first-rate, too. The only bad note is the really bad age makeup on Mary Todd Lincoln, but when a film is so good that you notice stuff like that, it's easy to forgive.I can't recommend this film highly enough.",10,3,7,24 June 2012
Mystic River," Truly amazing film without one false note or even mediocre performance
","People shouldn't review the movie they think they are seeing, they should review the movie they are seeing.This isn't a bleak, hopeless OR grim film. It's a movie about real people and real lives and the real situations that bind us together and tear us apart. There are no caped crusaders here...each person is explicable and even sympathetic in his/her own way. Some devices are figurative (the distant wife over the cell phone, the symbolism of which I really liked), others are literal.Robbins' Dave is just phenomenal. Anyone who has ever been abused (or knows someone who has been) will see their own thoughts rippling through this performance. He's quite clearly still the victim...never having fully grown (as the characters say toward the end) past the events he suffered at the age of 11. The context itself is the villain.And really, it's a film without villains or heroes. It's a movie about real people. And it has a cluster of some of the most remarkable, quiet, intelligent performances ever put to film, all riding above a fine script, and woven around an amazing directing feat.I love this movie and recommend it unreservedly, for those who can appreciate the flawed, striving human in all of us.For those of you who snipe at 'American films', I do hope you'll include 'Mystic River' in your assessments of what that phrase entails. It is a very, very American film without being Hollywoodish in the least.",10,1,3,6 February 2005
Dark Shadows," Insults about half of the original fans
","With the admonition, 'I never liked the bitch anyway,' the Willie character in the new DS dispatched my favorite Dark Shadows character, pretty much summing up Depp and Burton's apparent opinion of her. For me, Dark Shadows was about Julia and Barnabas. Their chemistry created the dynamic that made the show work for me. I'm not only a first- generation DS fan, I'm the co-author of the Dark Shadows Companion. Johnny Depp, supposedly a first-generation fan, even though he's two years younger than I am and I'm supposedly very young for a first generation fan, apparently thinks Barnabas Collins is part moral icon, part victim of his crotch. I wonder if Depp was watching the same series I was. As much as I loved the original Barnabas, I see no trace of the character in his interpretation. Frankly, the minute he murdered Julia, the whole movie collapsed for me -- the implied oral sex scene was bad enough, but the killing finished it. In the House of Dark Shadows big-screen remake this was accepted by fans because the series was still on-going. Depp does not have that salvation.I really don't care that she's alive for the sequel. I doubt there will be a sequel. If there is, it's still not the characters I grew up with. However, we're supposed to be reviewing what the film is, not what it's not. What it is, is an overstuffed suitcase that somebody sat on in order to zip it shut. It spills out all over everywhere. The cohesiveness is forced. The characters are largely unrecognizable. As I watched the film, I was at first taken by the wonderful graphics, but Collinwood seemed to morph into Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.There are some good performances, it's occasionally slightly funny, it's graphically intense and interesting, but Depp and Burton seem to have nothing but contempt for the original series. I'm sorry, but flawed and bad as it could be, Dark Shadows was still far more compelling on its tiny budget than this movie was with its huge one.What a shame -- and a waste. I really wanted to like it.",4,133,193,11 May 2012
