The Ring," The Ring will haunt you!
","The Ring is the best horror film i have ever seen, I am afraid to admit it but it even surpassed Psycho(1960). This kind of film is a treasure and should go down in history as the film to watch on Halloween. The film holds a PG-13 Rating and it still terrifies you down to the last bone in your body. Naomi Watts coming fresh off Muhollund Drive does a decent job as a mother and a victim of the situation of the videotape. No gore or blood, instead great quick shots and a haunting score from master Hans Zimmer causes this film to  scare without the over done sick killer movie. (ex. Scream). Watch the unique shots and colors in this film - they will stick with you.  BY THE way you will never look at another Television the same WAY! The Ring is GREAT! 9/10",9,4,6,4 October 2002
American Beauty," Did the Director have an obsession with teenagers showing themselfs
","I mean this movie could of been very good except for a couple key elements. The crazed i like to hit my child gay man next door. Didn't need his character to end like that, that was quite disturbing. Last but the most important is did this director have an obsession to see teens naked, a long seen with mena's breasts, and a scene of Birch's too. Not to mention some nudity of wes bentleys butt, all this nudity was very unnessary to the story, the movie would of done just as good without it. Sam mendes has potential, since this was only his second film, but he need to learn to develop a story with nudity, the better movies in history have not had nudity and neither do the movies today, like for example (Pearl Harbor - Epic movie, its got love, romance, action, war drama, and war action all without nudity. Except when the movie comes out on dvd, it will have a quick scene of Kate's rear, i think that is unnessary too). Sam Mendes your good but you actually could be great.",4,1,2,16 August 2001
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Harbor will blow you AWAY!
","Pearl Harbor is very well done in every aspect of movie making. Yes the movie is long but it is needed to be that long to show everything it needs to show.The acting is superb.All should win an oscar especially- Jon Voight, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett. The visual and sound deserves oscars. The directing and producing deserves oscars. Since Jerry and Michael are the best in film making these days. overall this movies rocks, and an epic movie that i hope goes down in history, for making you cry making you cheer and making you sit on the edge of your seat. SEE this MOVIE!!!",10,4,10,5 July 2001
Black Hawk Down," Superior to all others
","Black Hawk Down (****)The movie is realistic and emotionally, making it a superior war movie.
The movie is very gory, but the scenes are quick and right into another
action sequence. I wouldn't think the scenes would haunt you!
A must see film, 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,20 January 2002
