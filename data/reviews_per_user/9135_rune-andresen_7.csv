The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Slow & Boring
",What did I expect? The Hunger Games concept is a copy of Battle Royal. When a writer is trying to develop the concept to be something else than young people killing each others - well - the result is quite boring. This movie could have been a 15 minutes intro to the next movie. In order to add some excitement they are adding small scenes that have nothing to do with the story or the story boarding. I have forgot all about the characters from the last movie - and I don't care. The only thing I can do is to be amused/entertained by Donald Sutherland's evilness. Jennifer Lawrence is not a bad actress at all - but her acting skills are not sufficient to save this movie alone. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman is/was indeed a great actor is role is to small as well to make any difference.This movie is a disappointment - and they are 'milking the cow' shamelessly.,2,30,44,4 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A worthy ending to Disneys cash cow saga
","Star Wars will never be the same after the original trilogy. Sure, it has been a cash cow for a long time - However, the ending trilogy is at least an improvement to the mediocre soap opera from the early 2000s.This final episode is actually not too bad. Specially the story about Rey and Palpatine is the backbone of the whole movie. It's dark and interesting. The droids also have plenty of personality in this movie, and some of the nostalgic flashbacks are good fun as well. I was also relieved that the political correct and victim of bullying, this Rose character was limited to a background role in this movie (Just like JarJar).It shouldn't be Disney nor the SW fans mission to embrace/accept mediocre and not very attractive actors.However, the worst part of this movie is the scenes with Leia. They didn't have enough material to make this credible and the dialogue felt stunted. Rey and Palpatine also made some of other characters feel like Disney channel at 12:00 PM.I would like to see a new final cut, with less Disney channel content, less Leia and stupid/simple X-fighter pilots, more Droids, Rey and bad guys. That said, I am not disappointed.",6,2,8,29 December 2019
Evil Dead," No humor or self-irony
","Graphically, the movie is very good. Initially, there are some scary scenes too. However, the humor and self-irony seen in the previous Evil Dead movies are not present at all. This movie is trying to make a 'serious' version of Raimis old humor... And it doesn't really work. See Drag me to hell instead!The story boarding wasn't to good either:<ul><li>I didn't understand who is the main character. - I didn't understand why some things happened - I really was not able to get to know the characters at all.</li></ul>The end make no sense at all.",3,1,6,22 September 2013
The Witch," Authentic and well made
","Witch is a different horror movie - not for everybody.This movie is authentic and well made / produced. There is a mysterious atmosphere in the wild woods to say the least. The story may be interpreted differently - as a horror movie or a description of what people believed back then. However, it's a bit boring and slow - and a bit too depressive. It is like an intelligent version of the Blair With project - but you need to be patient in order appreciate it. That said, I believe there is a lot of potential in this way of making movies. I will look forward to their next movie.",5,1,3,23 October 2016
Arrival," Good Sci-fi - but trying too hard to be 2001 space odyssey and fails
","The movie is good - and perhaps better than good. If you like sci-fi it's a must-see movie. However, it is not great – and it is really trying way too hard to compete with movies like 2001 Space odyssey and Interstellar. The movie cannot decide whether the main object is the alien or the human. The humans are boring and I really just wanted to know more about the aliens. The movie is trying to give us insight into the 'main character' life story – but it's difficult to care. Of course, this movie is more about humans and human behavior and communication – and the aliens work as a metaphor. The main problem is that the metaphor has a personality, while the 'main characters' has none. The visuals and music is Excellent. The movie would have worked very well as a music video. Due to very boring main characters the movie is not even close to 8 stars. However, there are several elements of greatness in this movie. 6 stars.",6,2,8,12 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A solid work with a few opportunities for improvements (until next time)
","Do not read this if you have not seen the movie! As an old Star Wars fan, few movies are more important as a part of my childhood - and no movies can even replace them. I did tolerate the pre-sequels, but never respected them. The Force Awakens is more than approved, and even a bit more. They have managed to give new life to the franchise - and I think that was a difficult goal to achieve. What was particularly good was the visuals and the ability to tell a good story. It was also nice to see old heroes once again. However, what I liked best was the new and young actors - all were trustworthy and good actors. They will undoubtedly be able to carry the story forward! Due to the above reasons, I give this film grade 8. It may be a strong 7, or something between a 7 and 8 - but I have to give it a 8 for now. What is most important: It is indeed a good movie.However, there are some opportunities for improvements for the next movies from my point of view:<ul><li>The new order is a little implausible, and we'll never get a good explanation of how they managed to be established in the first place. Even more difficult to understand is that they managed to build a new Death-star while the Republic has dominated the galaxy for the past 30 years.</li></ul><ul><li>The new evil 'Emperor / Big evil boss ' looks like a monster from The lord of the rings. They could have defined the new emperor in a slightly different way IMHO. </li></ul><ul><li>The new order may seem like a parody of Nazism, and is not very dark or very mysterious. I hope they manage to define the new order in a slightly better way next time. Right now they seem a bit like the bad guys on a Sunday morning movie / Matinée.</li></ul><ul><li>I liked that the movie had a bit of humor and self-irony (this is a complete new element in SW - and may be a bit difficult for old fans to get used to - but we will eventually will get there), but it was a little too widely used in scenes where they should have been more serious.</li></ul><ul><li>It's a little difficult to understand what the new order really wants. They are just 'bad' right now. </li></ul><ul><li>The film is a little easily digestible and does not provide the viewers the opportunity to think so much themselves. It is not uncommon that American movies may be a bit straightforward, and leave behind few 'loose ends' or opportunities to interpret the movies in different ways - but I really hope that the next movie is a bit more mysterious or darker.</li></ul>Alle this said, It is really nice to have Star Wars back. I have waited since 1983, and I am grateful for this solid peace of work. I cannot be compared to the pre- sequels, and I am happy that George Lucas sold his rights to Disney. They have proved themselves worthy to take over the franchise.",8,2,11,20 December 2015
Furious 7," Poor story with plenty of action, half-naked ladies and guns
","An action movie can indeed have a great story and balance. The best action movie ever, in my opinion, is Terminator 2. The action is there, but there are also moments of low-key scenes to build up the story. When the action scenes arrives, they are set in context with the characters and the story.Fast 7 have very poor story boarding and a even worse story. The characters are very shallow with few exceptions. Some scenes are very embarrassing to watch, and the dialog in 'romanic' moments are stolen from an essay from ground school. There are almost no breaks between the action scenes, and the overall music does not match the scenes very well.Fast 5 was in contrast a far better movie with more self-irony and a more 'trustworthy' story. I suspect they have tried to amplify Fast 7 to make it even more spectacular. They failed in my opinion. The best part of the movie is the very ending, but it is not in harmony with the rest of the movie at all. I was very furious after watching this movie - it is a waste of time and money.",1,151,535,2 April 2015
