Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Truly Awful
","This film was rubbish. Watch LOTR and see how special effects should be used. They should support the story, not be the story. The characters were silly, the film was childish and everything was ridiculous. I won't waste anymore comments. This film has managed to actually spoil my opinion of the original trilogy.The story starts with a bunch of special effect and silly spaceshifts. All the actors perform badly, even the black guy from Pulp Fiction! After this, there is some Jedi council and a green guy with a long neck talking some gibber gabber about the universe. Then there are a few armies and some fighting. Here we get more silly special effects and computer stuff to hide the lack of plot, acting and directing. The new characters are pathetic compared to Harrison Ford. Also the landscapes are nothing but effects and looks silly.At the end some spaceships fly around and a few people get hurt. Then there is somemore spaceships and something else happened. What a load of rubbish.",1,2,4,28 February 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Great film
","This is an excellent film. The direction isn't perfect but the performances, especially Zhang Ziyi's, are awesome. The fight scenes are awesome*********Spoilers******* The film starts in China and finishes there as well. So there isn't much travelling to different countries at all. Then there is some fighting over a sword.The film is not gr8t. But the cinematography is. Also the fights are beautifuly choreographed (although i dont really approve of the flying and weird suff.This film is worth seeing though. In fact, anything with Zhang Ziyi in it is worth watching cus' she is gr8t and looks good",10,0,1,28 February 2004
