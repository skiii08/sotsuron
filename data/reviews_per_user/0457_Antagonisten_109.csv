The Devil's Advocate," Epic train-wreck
","It is with mixed feelings that i review this movie. Simply because every time i re-watch it i get a different feeling about it. Sometimes it's just awful, other times it's close to entertaining. I guess it depends mostly on what mood i'm in.This movie actually starts out pretty good in my opinion. This is definitely one of Keanu Reeves least embarrassing performances, at least the first hour or so of the movie. He's still stiff as a wooden board and about as exciting, but it fits his character. He's the hillbilly hotshot lawyer from a back water in Florida who has never lost a case. And now he gets the chance to go to New York and play with the big boys. And the biggest boy of them all is an adrenaline-pumped Al Pacino. It seems that every other movie or so Al Pacino goes off (or on?) his medication and suddenly turns into a freak show all of his own. Watch 'Scent of a woman' for another example of this. Here he is over the top most of the time. Barely just pausing to catch his breath.The movies main topics are sex, expensive wallpaper and Satan. And of course Keanu showing off what a damn fine lawyer he is. And before the end the whole story crashes like a train wreck of epic proportions. And the mad driver on the crashing train is an Al Pacino on speed.This movie certainly has some entertainment value. And the first half it also has some potential. But the decline from the first to the second half is almost unprecedented. All quality, sense of cohesion and plot just disappears into a black hole. And the rating? Well a 4/10 maybe?",4,4,10,22 March 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The boredom of sequels
","It's not news that Hollywood has serious writing problems these days. Most of what comes out is tedious rehashes of things we've seen a million times before. Especially this is true of sequels where the previous movies often seem to be a heavy luggage that drags the movie down, rather than a legacy to build on.I loved the first Pirates of the Caribbean-movie, I still think it's one of the best adventure movies in a very long time. It's got a near-perfect mix of adventure, action and comedy without ever becoming too silly or too violent. Of course it also had great actors to match. The second movie was slightly less entertaining but still good. The third one I remember seeing at the theater, but I can't for the life of me remember anything from it. Probably that's not a very good sign.This fourth installment has all the elements that made the first movie great. It has the adventurous music, good actors (Depp, Rush, McShane etc.) and a fairly suitable mix between action and comedy. Still, it does nothing to excite me. I just sat there feeling like I had seen it all before, and nothing really came as a surprise. There is just no creativity here, like everyone is just going through the motions. Quite frankly, half-an-hour in I was beginning to get pretty bored. And of course it didn't help that each and every movie these days has to drag on for almost 2,5 hours even though there is script for about 1,5. Is there some hidden premium when you make long movies? Wouldn't it be cheaper to shoot a movie that's 90 minutes instead of 200? Many of the problems I experience with a lot of movies today could be solved by slashing 20-30 minutes from the running-time and adjusting the script accordingly.In the end watching this is like watching Pirates of the Caribbean for the fourth time. Nothing new, nothing fresh and I found it incredibly hard to care about anything that happened. If you really like all of previous movies I guess you will like this too, since it's more of the same. But honestly, for the rest of us it's not worth the trouble. It's not as bad as the latest Transformers-movie, but seeing both of them in a short space of time I'm about fed up with Hollywood-sequels for a while. I want to see something fresh, and this corpse has been floating for a while.",Null,0,0,15 November 2011
Scarface," Over the top
","I had a lot of fun reading all the comments about this movie here on IMDb. It seems almost everyone agrees that this movie is a classic, almost to the point of being underrated (and a movie loved by everyone that is STILL underrated must be amazing!). I must say that i am of a different opinion. I would rather have to say that this is one of the most overrated movies of our time.The story of the Cuban immigrant going from having nothing to controlling the drug-trade in Miami, making millions and millions of dollars, is nothing spectacular. The same story has been made numerous times both before and after. This however is not necessarily anything negative. The story does have it's points. What i can't help feeling is that the story has been done so much better before. While there are many things separating 'The Godfather' parts 1 and 2 from 'Scarface', too many things to really compare them, the Godfather movies were still a so much better tale of an immigrants rise to criminal fame and riches.The main problem i have with 'Scarface' however is that most of the time i don't even know if it's being serious or not. Simply because everything is so ridiculously over the top. Wardrobe, acting, music, cinematography and not least the dialog. It's all bordering on comedy, and sometimes quite blatantly stepping over that border. The most shining example is Al Pacino. A talented actor no doubt. But his accent here is... i can't even find the right word to describe it. It comes and goes through the whole movie, and his English is more broken in the finale than ever before in the movie (his English is WORSE in the end than it was when he first came to the US. 'Sayy helo to my liddle fren'?! And i don't even want to know what Michelle Pfeiffer did here, she was awful to say the least. It looks as though she felt completely out of place. And i can imagine that a frantic movie like this could make actors feel a bit strange.So this is an entertaining movie. But i'm entertained more by how bad it is than anything else. It brings out loads of laughter, but not from being smart or well-made, rather by being silly and overblown. Many lines of dialog are instant classics, but mostly because of the laughable way they are uttered. DePalma proves here more than anywhere that he is the king of 'style over substance'. I watch this, and i am entertained. But a classic it is not. I rate it 3/10.",3,19,38,21 February 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not as enjoyable as it should be
","Sacha Baron Cohen is a very unique comedian in my opinion. He is undeniably intelligent, can be very very funny and he seems to have no single ounce of shame in his whole body. While that is his strength, it's also his Achilles heel.For those who have watched the Ali G-show and other Baron Cohen-outings, Borat is not a new character. I have often found the Borat-segments to be among the funniest in his shows. The happy and easy-going, but always misunderstanding, Kazak brings out both the best and worst in the people he meets. Cohen does a good job of bringing out peoples prejudices and strange (and often 'forbidden') opinions through the seemingly ignorant Borat. In this movie we get to see him provoking people at a rodeo, at a dinner party and at several other public events.The thing with this movie is that i don't know if most of it was really that funny. Most of the time i was just shaking my head in disbelief. Sure there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but most of it is just so embarrassing it's hard to watch. He does so many 'forbidden' things that he soon becomes a walking faux pas. Which is funny for a while but becomes more painful after a while.In the end this becomes one of those cases where i can see what they were thinking, can appreciate the effort, but in the end the result is not as enjoyable as it should have been. After all, there are just so many times i can hear him call people retards, bashing homosexuals and Jews before it becomes old. Borat is a funny character but i think i prefer him in smaller doses, this becomes almost overpowering. For those who can't get enough of the embarrassments this should be a treat though. For the sensitive people it's, as always with Cohen, best to stay away. I rate this 6/10.",6,1,6,4 December 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Improvement on the second movie
","The first Mission Impossible-movie with Tom Cruise was a pleasant surprise for me when i first saw it. The mood of the original series was decently preserved while it was still a modern movie. The second movie directed by John Woo was in my opinion a complete disaster. Woo is one of my favorite action directors normally, but he failed miserably there. The action scenes were awful, the story pathetic and the whole movie felt like anything but Mission Impossible.So, brand new start with installment number three. Or at least that was what i hoped for, something more along the lines of the first movie. And was it? Well, both yes and no. The emphasis is still much on action scenes, but at least it's not as overstated and pathetically choreographed as in Mission Impossible 2. The story is somewhat better better in the third movie, and the action scenes are much improved. Also the balance between smartness and action is better with at least a little more agent-style scenes. So while it was an improvement there was still much i didn't like.First of all, the idea in Mission Impossible was always solving things with your brain, not with guns. There is too much focus on the guns in this movie. I had also expected a lot more from Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy, he's definitely one of my favorite actors. But his part here doesn't really let him come into his own, although he is by far the best actor in this movie. Tom Cruise is what he is and he works OK without being brilliant, much like always. Another thing that bothered me is the plot-holes that keep appearing. Without saying too much it soon becomes impossible to trust anyone and everyone seems to get a hold of secret information very easily. That is always something i feel is very annoying, when the very organization the hero works for seems to be structured by and for imbeciles.All in all this is a great improvement on the second installment, but that doesn't make this a great movie. I had hoped it would be more along the lines of the first film but the action is still the main thing here. Also the 'smart' parts that are more Mission Impossible-like are not very good here. Many of them are just too unbelievable, others downright silly. It's a pretty entertaining ride while it lasts, but it leaves a pretty dull impression when the show's over. I give it a 5/10.",5,0,0,8 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh my god!
","This movie actually hurt my feelings. One of the greatest trilogies ever to reach the screen, and THIS is how they make the follow-up? The two Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) come to help out negotiating a truce between the trade alliance and a small planet kingdom. While doing this they encounter a boy who has the possibility to become the greatest Jedi ever.Oh my god! That's all i thought while watching this mess of a movie. I have had my expectations shot to pieces before, i know what it feels like. But never has it hurt like this. I had waited for so many years for the follow-up to the original Star Wars-trilogy. And what do we get? 133 minutes of wooden actors reading lines that could make grown men cry, and action scenes that look like a video game.The thing that bothers me most about this movie is that all the feeling for what actually WORKS is gone. The first movies might not have been the pinnacle of cinematic perfection. But they had that feeling that made them such a great experience. It was adventure, drama, emotion and action mixed in a way that was every young man's dream! Here instead we have whiny little kids race-driving, silly aliens and actors that seem to be completely lost. The magic has gone missing! When this is written the third part in the prequel trilogy has not come out yet. The second part was a clear improvement over this one, but unfortunately not enough so. The only positive thing i can think of is that now expectations are so critically low that the third part would really have to hit rock bottom for it to be a disappointment. This is kindly enough rated a 4/10.",4,6,12,2 February 2005
Skyfall," Didn't do it for me
","I feel like a grumpy old man these days, realizing that very few movies 'do it' for me any more. Skyfall is one of the movies that fail to excite me. While it's certainly competent film-making, it doesn't have that wow-factor and in the end failed to grip my attention properly.The James Bond-franchise has felt a bit tired and outdated for a long time. While I felt that Casino Royale breathed some new life into it, Quantum of Solace was more or less a dud. This movie seems to pick up on the fact that this sort of movie is more or less an anachronism today, and they play a little with that in the story. The truth though is that I'm not sure Bond has a place in today's film. Especially not since much of what made Bond unique is more or less lost, this movie basically plays like a regular action-movie without any of the real characteristics of a Bond-movie. They have even let go of the gadgetry, and while Javier Bardem is certainly a competent actor, I think he makes a somewhat pale villain. While the Bond-franchise is struggling to get up to date, I feel that it's history is weighing it down.Disregarding the Bond-factor this is, like I said in the beginning, competent film-making. It looks good, action-scenes are not bad (although not spectacular either). Daniel Craig is his stone-faced self, and Judy Dench is given a lot of space which is never a bad thing. Of course, as is almost standard fare today, the movie is far too long. 30 minutes could easily be cut out without diminishing the movie.I didn't dislike the movie, it just failed to wow me. I think it has a lot to do with expectations, I want that exciting crazy feeling you got from the older Bond-films where villains where almost magically evil, and they built up entire cities inside mountains with little trains running through them. You just don't get that any more. I miss it, and Bond is a lot less compelling without that magic.",6,17,34,30 July 2014
Marie Antoinette," Surprisingly good
","I must admit the subject-matter of this movie didn't interest me much. The only really interesting historical facet for me was how the film-makers handled the love-affair with Axel Von Fersen, whom i wrote an essay about in a distant past. Anyway, the attraction for me was undoubtedly Sofia Coppola, mostly since 'Lost in Translation' proved to be such a magical experience.What i expected from this movie was something infinitely lighter. A minor and pleasant distraction. A beautiful little film with wonderful costumes, nice visuals and fair acting. Actually the movie surpassed my expectations. While it was not a masterpiece or a movie i'm likely to remember on my deathbed, it was still a lot more entertaining than i imagined it would be. The actors all do a fine job, Jason Schwartzmann surprising me the most as Louis XVI, and the visuals are wonderful. So the movie delivered where i thought it would. The bonus was the fact that the story was more engaging than i expected. The beautiful and frail Marie Antoinette feels like a real person and i actually cared about what happened to her. Sure in retrospect it might be difficult to feel any true sympathy for someone like her, someone who lives in extraordinary luxury while the masses starve. But it's hard not to see her as somewhat a victim of circumstance. A person placed in a time and place she doesn't fully understand, and who tries to make the best of it.Marie Antoinette is sure to please those mostly interested in the beautiful surface. There is definitely enough of that since this is a beautiful-looking movie. It also has a very nice soundtrack to match the visuals, a mix between modern music and more period-like pieces. Surprisingly though there was also more to like beneath the surface, which made this movie that much more enjoyable. Worth watching! 7/10",7,7,13,1 January 2007
Training Day," A B-movie
","I can start off by saying that i consider the Academy Award to be a very dubious award. It seems more like a pat on the back for long and faithful service (and with a little added political correctness) than a true award for outstanding achievement. That being said i still think it's insane that this movie (or rather the actors in this movie) was nominated for two Academy Awards and received one.Now don't get me wrong, Denzel Washington is a terrific actor. I have seen and liked him in many parts but this just isn't one of them. In fact part of why this movie is such a failure is Denzel Washington. The whole streetwise cop-routine just doesn't work for him. He ends up looking like the kind of cop who wouldn't have survived one episode of 'The Shield' (to name one similar reference). And still we are to believe that he is a man who has lived well off of bribe money for a long time.And the second issue of credibility is of course Ethan Hawke. I'm not an expert on the American police authorities but somehow i doubt that someone would like to put Ethan Hawke in plainclothes in an all-black/Hispanic neighborhood. Even that issue put aside Ethan Hawke still looks like he's fifteen years old and completely lacks any credibility as a policeman. And for this he gets one Academy Award nomination? And beside these monumental issues? Well it's more or less like one long and quite poorly written episode of 'The Shield'. The old jaded corrupt cop shows complete disregard for his own and his rookies safety when he plays the streets like an amateur throughout. The technical quality of the movie are OK, as is the scenery. The acting is not impressive though, although i would credit that to poor writing more than substandard actors.'Training Day' is a B-movie in every respect except one; it has stars attached to it and one of those stars was long overdue for an Academy Award. This movie could just as easily have been in theaters for two weeks and then gone right to the video store if you replaced Denzel with, say, Cuba Gooding Jr. And an over-acting star in a poorly written role does not a good movie make. Personally i lament that Denzel couldn't get his award for a more memorable performance, also in that regard is this movie a waste.",3,2,6,14 August 2006
The Big Lebowski," Stylish and exceptionally funny
","The Coen brothers make the kind of movies that i think you either love or hate. Their very special brand of humor and their weird characters make them an experience out of the ordinary.Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is called 'The Dude' by his friends. He's an aging hippie living the comfortable life mostly just bowling. However one day he is mistaken for the infinitely more ambitious Jeffrey Lebowski, an industrialist of considerable wealth. The mix-up leads to a set of events among including among other things German nihilists and kidnappings.You have never seen Jeff Bridges like this before! I don't know what it is that the Coen brothers have, but they always seem to bring out the strangest things in the actors they use. Just look at John Goodman, as soon as he works with the Coens he shines like never before. Anyway, the very strange comedy that this movie presents is something that defies explanation. But i can say that i found it amazingly funny, well written and well played. And it's also a beautiful movie with high quality photography as well as cinematography.This is probably the funniest movie that the Coen brothers have ever made, in competition with 'Arizona Junior'. A hysterical mix between weird characters, weird comedy and great film-making. A must-see. I rate it 7/10.",7,0,2,15 January 2005
Underworld," Kate Beckinsale in leather
","When i tried to watch this movie the first time i didn't even get past the first fight scene. I thought it felt like such a cliché i didn't even want to see the rest. But now i gave it a second chance. And well, not as bad as i expected the first time around, but i don't know if it's that good either.The style of this movie is sort of the classic 'bits and pieces'. Meaning that the director and script-writer has taken small pieces of movies they like and put it together into a movie of their own. Now and then i just felt like 'Oh, that's The Matrix' and 'Oh, that's Blade' and so forth. Not that there is anything wrong with that necessarily as long as you have something of your own to add to the mix.So, what worked? Well some of the action scenes were pretty good. The actors took the whole thing the way they should, the acting didn't become neither pompous nor silly like it so often does in vampire movies. And admittedly Bill Nighy is always a joy to watch, as is Kate Beckinsale in tight leather (although a different kind of joy completely). Also, as someone else mentioned in their review, the lack of comic relief was very positive. Nowadays it seems nobody can make an action or horror movie without pushing in stupid one-liners and quips. Here though the mood is kept throughout, which is refreshing. And what didn't work? Well, the whole story is a bit silly really. Vampires fighting Werevolves, and nobody noticing apparently since there is no police and seldom any regular people in the city where this whole thing is taken place. Also the fight scenes again, while some of them were well done, many of them lacked the real nerve. When the fighting is done between two different kinds of monsters i want to see fierce fighting, animal rage and carnage. Here we get some sort of martial arts Matrix style mixed with a little biting. Which really takes the edge of.To sum the whole thing up i found this movie to be less bad than i had anticipated. Certainly no masterpiece and absolutely not a classic, but still a decent entry into the worn genre of Vampire movies. Also any Vampire movie that excludes the whole eastern European accent thing more or less completely gets at least one extra point.",6,1,4,13 March 2006
The 13th Warrior," Decent entertainment
","This movie, directed by Michael Crichton and based on his novel 'Eaters of the dead', is considered one of those quite massive mistakes that sometimes happen in the movie industry. The movie was delayed by months (maybe even years) and the test screenings were disastrous. In an effort to save what could possibly be saved the movie was cut down and released in a more or less completely altered version.What appealed to me with this movie was most of all the swinging of swords. I don't what it is with such movies, but ever since i was a kid and up until today swordplay holds a certain appeal to me. Probably that's why i've even seen the Conan-movies a few times too much... Anyway, when it comes to sword-swinging action like this movie there are two things that must be included: (1) Well-filmed fencing scenes, (2) Blood.The problem with many movies today is that the ratings-system must have gone overboard since the early 1980's when Conan got away with displaying gushing fountains of blood when people were sliced with swords and mauled with axes and hammers. There is little blood in this movie and that's of course a letdown, but a bigger letdown is the lack of decent fencing-scenes. The action-scenes are few and far between and much too short.This movie does feel like an edited version of itself. It's probably hard to salvage a movie that's been put through so much editing and re shooting as this one, so i guess the result could have been much worse. It's not nearly as awful as critics at the time made it out to be, but it's definitely flawed. Crappy writing and pale actors doesn't help the issue, and the fact that the final battles hint at a budget swiftly running dry is not to the films benefit either.The verdict? Recommended to fans of the genre i guess. If you like viking/barbarian-style action movies there is not much to choose from today (at least not much that's not child-safe). This is not a good movie, but not as bad as it could have been. I rate it 4/10.",4,0,1,4 November 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," As worthy a successor as i could have hoped for
","I have to admit i love the first 'Pirates of the Caribbean'-movie. I'm not that much of an adventure-fan usually, but there is just something about playfulness in movies that attracts me. When filmmakers allow themselves to play and have fun with the media as well as the subject. The first movie was genuine fun, and so of course the expectations were high for the sequel. Did it deliver? I think it did.Captain Jack Sparrow is a character to fall in love with. Insanely weird and existing somewhere between good and bad, wrong and right, he's just the perfect. Orlando Bloom who should have the Academy award for stiffness (if such is ever presented) is also perfect as the, guess?, stiff William Turner. The first movie had captain Barbossa (the always wonderful Geoffrey Rush) and this movie has Davy Jones (the equally wonderful Bill Nighy) who is a worthy successor. So the stage is set character-wise for a repetition of the success. Don't forget story though. Of course treasure is the goal and enemies must be avoided and vanquished. In this movie though there is more at stake than just simple gold, something that doesn't destroy the fun luckily. There is sword-fighting, acrobatics, insane stunts and crazy sailing to make everyone happy. Much as in the first movie.So we have the characters, we have the story, we have the action and the comedy. Is this a better movie than the first? Not in my opinion. The first movie had the advantage of being first, as well as a story that perhaps made more sense. But this is as worthy a successor as i could have hoped for. Intensely funny, exciting and without losing the comedy and tongue-in-cheek that made the first movie such a delight. Maybe just one small point, i somehow wish the third movie would have been released closer to this one considering how close it follows story-wise. But that is just a small complaint, something that will make the arrival of the third movie all the more exciting.7/10",7,3,6,24 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Surprisingly entertaining
","A movie based on a 'ride from Disneyland' or something like that. That was the first i ever heard about this movie. Not the best premise for a movie you might say. But i was very pleasantly surprised i must say.The governors daughter gets kidnapped by pirates. Her love-interest and the famous captain Jack Sparrow both set out looking for her. Her love wants her, Sparrow wants the pirate ship.Many have tried to live up to the matiné-classics of old. Or not just them maybe, also more modern classics like the Indiana Jones-movies. But it seems the essence of the adventure-film is hard to capture, considering how many have failed. And the pirate genre especially seems to be treacherous ground. Just think about such catastrophes as 'Cutthroat Island'. Here though the tradition of adventure, and fun for the whole family, is picked up in an admirable way.There are several elements that make this such a great experience. The acting is solid, especially from Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp who both seem to have a lot of fun here. Orlando Bloom is his rather stiff and bland self, even though it's less evident here than in most cases. Also this movie is very playful. It makes jokes at the genres expense, at almost everyones expense. And foremost it doesn't take itself very seriously. There is quite a bit of violence in the movie (it involves pirates after all), but it's all quite mild and it never disturbs the experience.When it comes to family fun this is one of the best i've seen. Not that i'm a fan of the 'family' genre, but still. And the older viewers can always stare at Keira Knightley, and maybe dream that we too could fence, sail and rescue ladies like her... Rating is 8/10 and very recommended!",8,1,4,15 February 2005
Hostel," Very little to like
","I have watched some of the horror movies that have come out this past year, and most of the time i have been tragically disappointed with what i've seen. Watered-down remakes of Asian horror films mixed with even worse remakes of Hollywood-ditto. And on top of that we have absolute crap like 'Skeleton Key', not a remake but still lacking all kinds of creativity and fresh ideas.One of the movies i did in fact enjoy somewhat was 'SAW'. And when i read what was written about 'Hostel' it seemed this would be something similar. But i think that it's pretty far from it. While 'SAW' was no real masterpiece as such, it did have a couple of nice touches. It was fairly original and most of all it had a definite touch of evil ingenuity to it that gave a certain touch to all of the unpleasantness. I found that touch sorely lacking in 'Hostel'.This movie starts out like a college-movie. Three guys in Europe enjoying legal drugs and loose women. Then they hear of a hostel in Slovakia where the women are apparently insanely beautiful and willing, and they love Americans. Too good to be true? Of course it is, this is a horror movie after all.It seems to me director Eli Roth really went above and beyond trying to create as many disgusting effects as possible in this movie. And in that respect at least, 'Hostel' was a success. But all the blood in the world, nor a shallow ending trying to make some sort of commentary about human nature, can't save a movie that lacks style as well as substance. Without either a sense of humor or a distinct message in all the carnage it's just blood, and blood in itself is not very interesting. I guess there is a huge crowd loving movies like this one and maybe i'm just not one of those people who can appreciate this kind of unpleasantness. Because when the movie ended i found very little to like or be impressed with.",2,0,0,28 February 2006
Blade," Entertaining for what it is
","The premise of this movie didn't look very interesting to say the least. So it was only natural that i was skeptical when viewing this for the first time. But i was actually surprised at how entertaining this movie turned out to be! Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half man, half Vampire who hunts evil Vampires and try to protect humans from the bloodthirsty creatures of the night. Now however he has become the hunted one. His special half-breed blood is interesting to the Vampires since they think it can be used to summon the mighty blood-god.There is mainly one reason why this movie works so well. And that is the action-scenes. There is a frenzied pace here that just keeps going throughout the whole movie. The acting is of course over the top, but still suitable to the movie. Stephen Dorff is entertaining as a Vampire leader, Wesley Snipes is suitably hard and composed as the hard-case Blade. There is some gore in this movie, but i think it's balanced quite nicely. It never becomes excessive.So watch this movie for the heart-pumping action and high pace. It's not movie of the year, and it's not Oscars material. But entertaining it is. I rate it 7/10.",7,0,1,11 February 2005
Alexander," Disappointing
","I caught this at the Stockholm International Film Festival of 2004. The theme of this year's festival was Oliver Stone and they showed several of his older (and better) films. Also there was an interview with Stone at the festival (although he was nowhere to be seen the day i watched this).Alexander is the story of Alexander the Great who conquered large parts of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. His armies went as far from his native Greece (or Macedonia as the movie states) as to India in his quest for more land to conquer. During his short life (he died at 33) he became the ruler of most of the known world and spread the western culture to many lands.Oliver Stone is an interesting director in my opinion. In my eyes he has always been capable both of great film-making (Platoon, Wall Street) and utter garbage (Natural Born Killers, U-turn, Comandante). But it seems lately his track-record is beginning to lose it's shine since most of the utter garbage he's made is later in his career. Unfortunately this borders on garbage.When i've read reviews here (and on other sites, not in papers since the movie is not released in Europe when i write this) i often see many references to the homosexual content in this film. Which i find surprising since that content feels more or less non-existent. Sure Alexander kisses a man and expresses affection for another, but it's not even clear whether this is proof he was bi-sexual. Anyway, the reason i bring it up is that i want to make clear it had nothing to do with my rating of this film.So, what's wrong with Alexander? Well the script is the main thing. It feels to me like the script emphasized the wrong things. We never get to know Alexander, never get to crawl under his skin and know the man he was. Instead, every time he's on screen he's either weeping or making a speech. It's the same with all the characters, they come out as extremely shallow cardboard figures. Instead of developing the characters, Stone tries to make the narrator drive the story ahead. This could have worked in a more story-driven movie, but this movie is centered on Alexander as a person and a king, which makes this a problem.Also, the editing is terrible in many ways. For instance, the first battle fought in the movie against the Persians ends very abruptly. Alexander attempts to beat the Persian king's army of 250.000 men (with his own army of 40.000) by killing the king himself, hoping that will stop his men from fighting. The attempt is failed and Alexander barely escapes with his life. Then suddenly the scene is cut, and the next scene shows Alexander marching into Babylon after his victory against the Persians... Editing like this, and the fact that the movie jumps 8 years forward and back a couple of times, doesn't really help the experience.The acting is another thing. I think Colin Farrell did a very good job portraying Alexander. It's not his fault that the character felt shallow and uninteresting, he undoubtedly did his best. Angelina Jolie on the other hand was a catastrophe. She screamed and looked menacingly at everyone, and her Russian accent is completely misplaced and uncalled for. The accents were a chapter of their own. All of the Greeks spoke a kind of Scottish/Irish accent that there is no real explanation to.So, in the end, what can i say to sum things up? Well, Alexander sure looks nice enough. The battle scenes (the few there are) look very nice and certainly more interesting and well done than in Troy for instance. But the movie feels like it doesn't know what i wants to be. It's too shallow for a biography of Alexander, it's too muddled and messy to be story-driven, and there is way too little action for it to be action-driven. The end result is very slow, rather uninteresting and forgettable. I rate it 4/10 and conclude that the thing that will probably stay with me longest after this experience is the music. Vangelis hardly ever disappoints.",4,0,1,26 November 2004
Hot Fuzz," Lame
","I'm a fan of British comedy, and quite honestly i'm not really a gourmet when it comes to comedy in the first place. I don't have a problem with laughing at both high and low. So i expected this movie to offer some serious laughs. Especially considering the hype. But i was disappointed.We see this kind of comedy now and again. It's an attempt to mix old-fashioned small-town gag comedy with something cool and new. And it rarely works. The result is almost always too slow-paced, teeth-less and lacking any serious bite. Hot Fuzz has a few funny moments, but in general it's found wanting. The beginning is rather funny and i did see the potential in the whole set-up. But it's very poorly executed. Much of the movie just drags on with jokes few and far-between. The film-makers try to create a sense of action by some quick editing, which makes the movie seem even slower. Then, in the end, when we finally have our showdown... Well, it's a big anticlimax. Somehow it seems that they never really wanted to go all the way. Instead of going 100% in the end and make it the crazy shootout it needed to be, we instead have a mellow fight that never reaches more than 60%. This movie is not so bad that a huge blowout in the end couldn't have saved it, but that never happens.In the end this movie warrants a few smiles and the occasional laugh. But it's far from great. Great actors are thrown away on small parts and Simon Pegg honestly isn't that funny. I don't know why they decided to make the whole affair so lame, there is certainly enough gore to make this movie appropriate for adults only... So why tone down the violence and the more no-holds-barred comedy? No, this won't do.",5,1,9,7 October 2007
Constantine," Not very entertaining at all
","This movie is what i would term 'promising but flawed'. The premise i found to be quite decent, but the film-makers were unable to capitalize on it. And the end result is a rather dull movie that fails to deliver.How Keanu Reeves gets to continue his mission of destroying every single project he touches is beyond me. The man lacks any discernible talent and yet he keeps on appearing in high-profile projects like this one. I won't go as far as to say that Reeves ruined this movie (far more people contributed to that), but he was one of the disturbing factors. The more deep-seated problems here are the lack of a decent script and the lack of feeling for the subject. What could have been a good setup for an action movie turns into a movie that doesn't seem to know what it wants. Which is sad really. The very good special effects and very nice photography show that a considerable amount of money and work has after all gone into this movie.There is just too little action for an all-out action movie, too little actual story for it to be story-driven. In the end 'Constantine' falls between the two genres becoming a rather slow action-movie and a very thin supernatural thriller. So, what's the problem with Reeves? Well besides his wooden acting he doesn't feel right for the part. The jaded, chain-smoking 'who gives a crap' hero is far too rugged for Reeves. He's just too well-combed, too neat, for a role like this. With an actor more up to the part it could have been at least a little better. Rachel Weisz does what she can with the female lead, but she obviously struggles with her rather uninteresting character.The main problem still remains the script though. It has serious problems with the pacing. The movie is very slow at times. It never becomes really interesting either, the story just never feels original or interesting enough to carry the movie. I think this was one of those times where the film-makers should have realized you can't have it all. Either they should have made this a no-holds-barred 'Blade'-like action movie, or they should have worked on the script and ideas and try to make it a solid supernatural thriller. Because this is not very entertaining at all.I rate it 3/10.",3,2,6,3 April 2005
Troy," Gladiator is to blame!
","I don't know how the whole 'swords-and-sandals'-trend started this time around. But i can take a qualified guess and say that it started with Gladiator, and of course all the Oscars that rained down on that film and it's cast. Just so you know who to blame for this bore.Troy is based on an epic by the Greek Homer. Since it's a genuine Greek tragedy one should not expect laughter and brightness to be the bulk of the film. It starts off with Troy making peace with Sparta. However the Troyan prince Paris can not keep his hands away from the Spartan king's wife, and as he steals her away the Spartan king promises to destroy Troy. The whole Greek army comes with him and they lay siege to Troy, among the Greeks is also the great warrior Achilles.I don't think movies that are slow are necessarily bad. I think a slow and thoughtful pace can sometimes heighten the experience. But Troy just seems to drag on forever. And, can you say pretentious? I don't really know what they wanted to make here. Did they want an action take on history, like in Gladiator? Did they want a loyal and truthful rendition of a classic story? Or did they just want people endlessly walking around i loincloths murmuring pointlessly to each other?! I don't think the last alternative was what they were aiming for, but i'm afraid that's what they got.Of course there are forgiving attributes. The acting is above par in many cases. Especially Brian Cox as king Agamemnon and Eric Bana as Hector stand out in my eyes. Eric Bana is increasingly becoming one of my favorites on the big screen. Brad Pitt however feels tragically miscast as Achilles, and his blond muscular surfer-look never really conveys the feeling of a 'great warrior'. And Orlando Bloom still remains one of the most overrated actors of our time, this is another stiff and uninteresting performance from him.But in the end, the actors neither save nor destroy this film. A script with more depth and perhaps more background to makes us feel 'inside' the story would have been needed. Also the pace should be quicker. If they moved a little faster and cut 20-30 minutes the movie could actually have been watchable. They could also have worked a bit on the period setting. It doesn't feel too convincing when all the actors have perfectly toned muscles, waxed and evenly tanned bodies and cleanly shaved faces. This is a constant annoyance in period-pieces like this. While Gladiator felt like a great film in the vein of (for instance) Ben Hur, Troy only feels 'big'. It looks expensive, feels expensive, but never really achieves that feeling you need to make it a true epic.A disappointment to say the least. I rate it 4/10.",Null,2,4,25 November 2004
Brokeback Mountain," A must-see
","It took me a while before i got to see 'Brokeback Mountain', and saying that expectations were high is an understatement. Raving reviews, Oscars and Ang Lee's track-record said that this should be something out of the ordinary. And it was.Movies about forbidden and impossible love is nothing new. Usually it's between a man and a woman, separated by perhaps family, culture or other such boundaries. Here instead it's two men facing that cultural boundary. A love that society can not and will not accept or understand. In my opinion the greatness of this movie is that it manages to feed the viewer both hope and desperation, both happiness and sadness. Happiness that there is love in the world despite the obstacles, sadness that small things should be allowed to get in the way of people's happiness.I'm quite surprised really that this movie has become so intensely popular despite it's, in many parts of the world at least, controversial subject. But i'm happily surprised. And 'Brokeback Mountain' is worth watching for so many reasons. The beautiful imagery, the flawless direction from Ang Lee, the powerful acting from especially Heath Ledger. And of course the amazing story. Definitely one of the best movies of 2005 and a must-see.",8,19,21,8 March 2006
Spider-Man 3," My eyes hurt
","I liked the first Spider-Man movie a lot. I liked the second somewhat less, but i still liked it a lot as well. Few movies have managed to capture the comic book-adventure feeling in quite the same way. The two first movies managed to be dramatic and funny at the same time, while still managing to get the best out of the comic.This however is something else completely. I wonder who at the studio made the decision to replace everything in the movie with a special effect? Where there used to be comedy, there are no special effects. Where there used to be action, there are now special effects. It's ridiculous to even call it special effects since there is probably hardly a single frame in this movie that is not edited with CGI. And trust me, i have nothing inherently against CGI, i only dislike it when it becomes a substitute for real film-making. And it does here.First of all a good villain is missing. A lot of the quality from the first two movies were Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina. Both were great villains in their own way, although Dafoe had more fun themes to work with. Here we have a man made of sand that makes you more sad than anything, and an 'evil' Spider-man which definitely makes me sad. While Haden-Church does the best he can with Sandman, the character is just not a lot of fun. He's more the tragic kind of villain. He has my sympathies, but he won't carry the movie on his own. Topher Grace in the sort of villain/asshole part is also OK, but again he doesn't have a lot of fun material to work with.Besides missing a proper villain though, this movie has one major flaw and that is the effects. While they are probably technically very well done, they look expensive anyway, they are difficult to look at. At least for me it felt many times as though i was watching an animated roller-coaster. People were flying through the air, punching each other and my eyes started watering after a while. First of all, it's too exhausting to watch - especially for an effects-packed 140 minutes, and second it's not very well done despite the technical qualities. After all, i want to be able to see what's going on, now it was just things buzzing in front of my eyes. It hurt after about 80 minutes. After 140 minutes i was ready to throw away my lenses.The third point that bothered me was the running time. Like i said above, 140 minutes is steep for something this action- and effects-packed. And besides that the movie really doesn't have the script nor the story for this kind of marathon-like running time. I was desperately bored by the end of the movie, and felt for a while it was the worst thing i'd seen in the theater for a long time. Of course, it wasn't that bad, but painfully slow endings will destroy even the best movie experiences.In the end this isn't a disaster of an experience. I can't say i enjoyed this movie though. It was a mix between high expectations from the first two installments, and a general disappointment in the fact that an obviously huge budget has given such sloppy and hysterical special effects. I want more than this from Spider-Man. This just won't cut it. I rate it 4/10.",4,0,0,10 July 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Not very good
","So the 'Resident Evil'-movies have reached the trilogy-mark. Apparently the first movie trilogy based on a video game. I have to question if this is something admirable or not. The first two movies were mediocre at best, and this third installment is no exception.First of all the story (if it matters). The world has been completely destroyed by the virus, almost all humans are zombies and the whole ecosystem has failed because of the virus. Basically the world has been turned into one giant desert. In this wasteland a few human survivors roam, among them Alice (Jovovich). Meanwhile The Umbrella Corporation has continued their research.First of all i can say that this is probably the best-looking of the three movies. The sets are very nice and the world does feel desolate. But mostly the positive comments end there. Like in previous movies, the action scenes are the major problem i have with the movie. I don't understand what's so hard about making decent action scenes. Here we have crappy choreography, boring fights and firefights that look like people are just running around shooting randomly. There is a lot of blood and gore (obviously), but not even that manages to spice things up. I wouldn't go as far as calling the movie boring, but the more quiet moments in the movie are actually the ones that work best. And for an action movie, that's not a very positive remark.What surprises me most about this movie is that they let Russell Mulcahy direct. There are a few directors in the industry that i wonder why people hire, Mulcahy is definitely one of those. Incidentally, so is the even-worse Paul W.S. Anderson. If you look at Mulcahy's track record, there is very little (if anything) to be impressed of. He has churned out almost exclusively crappy movies. And you can also see that in the last few years he's mostly had to settle for directing TV. Why they would hire him for this movie is impossible to understand. But i guess that it's yet another sign that the bar is not raised very high when making a Resident Evil-movie...In the end i found this to be about as enjoyable as the first two movies. That is: not very. It's not utter crap, but it's still light years away from better action movies. The problem nowadays is that there are other zombie-movies being made that are so much better than these. '28 Days Later', 'Dawn of the Dead' and '28 Weeks Later' for that matter, have raised the bar for the genre. Resident Evil doesn't even try to catch up. Which is kind of sad. I rate this 3/10.",3,1,2,25 January 2008
Zodiac," Lacks something
","It was hard for me to know what to expect when i sat down to watch 'Zodiac'. The word beforehand ranged from 'very good' to 'unbelievably slow and boring'. As usual the truth was somewhere between the extremes.'Zodiac' has one major flaw and one major advantage. We can start with the advantage: the actors. It was a long time since i saw a movie with this kind of ensemble. It seems almost every face is instantly recognizable from movies and TV, and all performances are top-notch. I especially liked Mark Ruffalos cop and John Carroll Lynch as an unusually creepy suspect. Brian Cox is as usual excellent in one of the best scenes of the movie (the TV-scene).The major flaw in my opinion was the pacing. I acknowledge that it's a fairly complicated movie (although not so much as many have tried to claim) and that it encompasses a lot of time. While that may be true, there are still ways to make time fly a bit faster for the audience. In the beginning of the movie the pace was pretty good and the tension was high. But as the movie went on that seemed to bleed off. There are a few moments when the nerve returns in the end, but i still looked at my watch number of times in the last hour.The pacing problem might suggest that i didn't like 'Zodiac'. But that's not true at all. Rather it's a good movie that has a few flaws that keep it from being great. The pacing being the worst of those. It has definite qualities though. The acting was the first one i mentioned. The second is the scope of the movie, it's an ambitious project to show decades of police work with the intense beginning and the dreary and long investigation, long after the media interest has died down.In the end this won't make it into my favorite movies because of something i can't really put my finger on. This movie lacks something. While it has an interesting story, great acting and ambition, there is still something missing. It would be pretentious to call it 'heart', but somehow that's the way it feels. David Fincher has always been a very competent but sometimes emotionally detached director. Sometimes that spills over and makes you care less about the movie than you would like to. That's unfortunately the feeling i got with 'Zodiac'.",6,1,2,23 October 2007
Cloverfield," Original
","Cloverfield made me curious when it came out. The whole thing with the film-makers not wanting to give anything away before the release has been done before. And the other similarities to 'Godzilla' were also worrying... But i chose to ignore them and feel curious nevertheless. Cloverfield looked it had something pretty unique to offer. But you never know until you actually watch it.And was it unique? Both yes and no i guess. The whole 'monster attacks New York'-thing is old as King Kong. But Cloverfield did have a few things to offer that sets it apart from most other movies. First of all the whole home-movie style works pretty well. We only get to see what the people in the movie see, nothing else. It creates both a sense of urgency and actually being there. That was a good move. I might also mention that the camera work is still not that bad considering it's supposed to be handy-cam. The picture is clear, the effects are really good and there is very little of nausea i can feel sometimes when the camera is waved around a lot.There are however a few things that i didn't like as much. While Cloverfield highlights the way the feel of a movie can really benefit from an unusual approach (handycams), it also shows one of the classic weaknesses of horror movies. Namely the monster itself. I'm afraid it works just as bad as it did in Godzilla. In the end the movie is also a more or less standardized action movie with a more interesting presentation.I did like Cloverfield fairly well. I think there are things that could have been done better. Not least the monster (how hard can it be?) and also it could have been more experimental with the story, like it was with the presentation of the story. But in the end this movie is pretty original and i did enjoy it. I think it's good to see something that at least tries to break the mold a little bit. I rate it 7/10.",7,1,3,4 May 2008
The Adventures of Tintin," Halfway great
","I have loved the Tintin-albums ever since I was little. I remember going to the library, having a few on loan most of the time. They are great stories and also artistically great. There has been some controversy lately about supposedly racist content in the Tintin-albums, but honestly I don't think most people who read the albums see them that way. And also, you have to consider that these are very old cartoons written in another time. Anyway, it was with a mix of fear and anticipation that I went to see this movie.I have to say the resulting movie has given me mixed feelings. It's a very divided experience with the first half feeling more like the albums. It's a puzzle mystery, the slapstick comedy of Thomson and Thompson and in general classic Tintin-fare. The second half contains a lot more action and feels like classic Spielberg-fare more than anything. I have nothing against Spielberg, but I'm not so sure that making Tintin into Indiana Jones is my preferred choice. Since I watched the movie in 3D (the only way to watch the movie with original language here) I found a little extra testing with the many fast and pretty roller-coaster-like action scenes.Considering that the movie is based on more than one album (three if I remember correctly), it can be a bit strange for those of us who know the stories. But in the end I think that the writing was above expectation. Even though the focus on action sequences in the latter half of the movie was a bit overdone, I think that the movie is very watchable. Tintin looks a bit creepy at times with his pale and waxy complexion, but Haddock is very well done and transports the character from the albums superbly. Although I don't remember him as having such a big nose...In the end I would have preferred a more toned-down movie with more emphasis on mystery and less on action. But I guess they have to sell their video games and appeal to kids with ADD as well. Considering that there will probably be a bunch of sequels I can always hope for a more subdued experience next time. I guess mostly I'm just happy they didn't ruin it.I give it 7/10.",7,1,5,7 November 2011
Ocean's Twelve," Fun for the moment
","So i finally decided to see 'Ocean's Twelve'. And i must say that it was above expectation. I feel the movie has been rather unfairly treated in the media, at least here in Sweden. But then again i never considered 'Ocean's Eleven' to be a masterpiece either so perhaps it has mostly to do with expectation.'Ocean's Eleven' was an entertaining movie no doubt. But the whole almost legendary status that it's gotten is pretty much beyond me. Sure it had loads of good actors, a fun sense of humor and was pretty nice all around. It was good entertainment for the moment, and in that respect it was among the best of it's genre. But a masterpiece? Not really.Perhaps this is also why i can accept 'Ocean's Twelve' more easily than many other people. The actors are still there, the style of the movie is pretty much the same and the comedy is also same brand as in the first movie. What is somewhat lacking here might be good ideas. It seems like in the first movie they knew exactly what kind of movie they wanted to make, they had a decent idea that (while being very far from original) worked. Also they had a plan when it came to using all the obvious talent in the cast to best effect. Here that plan seems to be missing. Also the movie has a problem with pacing, the first half is rather slow and it's not until the second half that the pace is picked up properly.Heist-movies pretty much follow a very strict formula and the 'Ocean's'-movies are no different. Cool people stealing things in a ridiculously complicated way. Added to all the famous names from the first movie is also french actor Vincent Cassel who is always a colorful addition to any movie he stars in. Despite his french antagonist, and despite the obvious attempts to leave the heist-formula a little bit, this movies greatest problem is still that we've seen it all done before.In short this is not a movie to remember, but i found it decent entertainment while it lasted. 'Ocean's Eleven' is a better movie, but not by as much as people seem to think. I rate this 6/10.",6,0,0,26 April 2005
Scary Movie 2," Not comedy, tragedy.
","This is not a comedy, it's an abomination. The Wayans brothers now prove that they have NO feeling whatsoever for what is funny and what is NOT funny.Four teens are here tricked into going to a haunted house by their teacher. This of course to spoof the horror-movie 'The Haunted', which fails miserably. What i don't understand is HOW they could fail to spoof 'The Haunting' which is a movie that offers ample opportunities for spoofing. But somehow they succeed. And basically all other attempts to make fun of movies, TV-commercials, music-videos etc. fail just as much.But this movie does have ONE redeeming feature. And that is that the only scene in the movie even remotely funny is right in the beginning, even before the credits! Because the spoof of 'The Exorcist' featuring James Woods at least offers a small laugh. And when that's over, you can just turn the TV off and save yourself 80(!) minutes of your life you could never ever get back. I rate this 2/10.",2,2,3,18 February 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Sad but enjoyable
","It's been a while since this movie came out on DVD. At first i wanted to see it in the theater, but it just never happened. And then i wanted to catch it as soon as it came out on DVD. That didn't happen either. But now, finally, i saw it.I can start by saying that i'm somewhat of a fan of Guillermo del Toro. Of course most of the movies i've seen from him have been either horror or action. But there has always been a distinct sense of style that i have appreciated about his work. Here he really takes that style to the next level. The first thing i noticed about this movie was the overall visual style. It looks simply gorgeous, be it in the fantasy world or the regular world.I was a bit skeptical of this movies theme at first. The whole idea of mixing fantasy and reality is something that i feel rarely works. My skepticism was mostly proved wrong by this movie. Mostly the mix between fantasy and reality works very well, and it's well integrated to the point where you are sometimes wondering what is real and what is not. Still del Toro manages to keep the 'real' elements of the movie stark and convincing, which is not an easy task.I guess what surprised me the most here was how sad and tragic this movie was. I expected something fairy-tale like, but what i got was a mostly sad and at times very violent story about something tragically real. I actually felt sad after watching the movie, it was a lingering feeling that i don't have very often. I was also surprised at how graphic the movie was, it really is a movie only for grown-ups. And probably not for all grown-ups either.To try and summarize this. Did i like the movie? Yes, i did. There is a lot to like here. There are strong emotions, beautiful visuals, magnificent acting, a gripping story and a good mixture between fantasy and reality. I found it to be somewhat overly graphic at times, and almost depressing in how bleak it was. But i still enjoyed it very much. I recommend it. 8/10.",8,1,5,27 January 2008
Blade II," Entertaining
","I have a weak spot for comic-book action. Something about the mix between today and the supernatural has always drawn me to it. And i found the first 'Blade' to be one of the more entertaining in the genre.Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been looking for his old-time companion Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) for a long time. Whistler was taken captive by vampires and Blade has slaughtered his way through the vampire clans of several countries to find him. Now though there is another threat to the human race that also affects the vampires themselves. Soon Blade is given an offer he can't refuse, resulting in a unholy alliance between the vampires and their greatest enemy.Guillermo del Toro is a man with what the Germans would term 'fingerspitzengefühl'. He's got that special feeling for what works on screen, especially when it comes to movies like this one. Blade 2 refines most of the elements seen in the first Blade movie. This is a violent and action-filled journey into a comic-book world and del Toro is not taking any prisoners. Wesley Snipes seems to enjoy himself as Blade and most of the other actors also seem to blend in nicely in the mood of the film.There were only a few minor flaws that bothered me. Most of all the sometimes shaky CGI-work. Some of the special effects look cheap to say the least. Especially the use of digital 'stand-ins' for the actors that are used in some action scenes to spice them up a bit. All in all though this is an entertaining ride in it's overblown testosterone-rich way. I rate it 6/10.",6,33,45,18 January 2005
Blades of Glory," Do you like Will Ferrell?
","It seems to me that Will Ferrell is working like a factory these days. Movies like this one seem to come out every six months or so. Or maybe that's just how it feels, but after seeing movies like 'Anchorman', 'Talladega Nights' and others in rather short succession it feels like Ferrell is everywhere. And why not i guess, he does have genuine comedy talent in my opinion.This movie is about the rivalry of two male figure skaters. One of them, Will Ferrell, is the bad boy of skating. The other, Jon Heder, is a saint-like mamas-boy. After a competition they start to fight, after that they are both banned from male skating forever. Although new ideas soon get them both back on the ice, this time as a team.The whole figure-skating thing just begs to be turned into a comedy. It's a silly sport (figure-skaters will have to excuse me) and on top of that of course very feminine even for the male skaters. I guess part of the reason why figure skating is considered so feminine is the fact that if you skate you either figure-skate or play hockey... And those things are at very opposite ends of the scale. Anyway, the idea of Ferrell as slating's bad-boy works pretty well. There are quite a few memorable scenes in this movie, most of them happening on or around the ice. It also has quite a few moments of silly comedy that doesn't really go anywhere. But in general the whole set-up works pretty well.I guess the main thing here is whether you like Will Ferrell or not. If you don't like him, this is bound to become tiresome rather quickly. I think Ferrell is one of the most talented people doing these kinds of movies, so personally i didn't mind. I did like Talladega Nights better though. Still, if you like this brand of comedy (the brand of other Will Ferrell-movies and movies like Dodgeball, 40-year Old Virgin etc.) this will probably keep you entertained. I rate it 6/10.",6,0,2,3 September 2007
Lost in Translation," Magic!
","When it comes to feel good-movies i always find it hard to point out the special thing that the movie has that makes me feel GOOD. I guess i have that trouble here as well. But still, somehow this movie makes me warm inside.The actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) comes to Tokyo to shoot a commercial for a whiskey-brand. There he meets the bored Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who visits Tokyo along with her boyfriend who is a fashion photographer. The odd couple find each other and experience Tokyo together.Bill Murray is almost always excellent. Here he's just fantastic as the jet-lagged and world-weary actor Bob Harris coming to Japan to shoot a commercial, seemingly without knowing really WHY he does it. Scarlett Johansson is equally great as the boring young woman he meets at the hotel and teams up with. Their journey through Tokyo with all the confusion and wonder is just something out of the ordinary. As i said before, i don't know exactly what it is. But something in this movie just makes me feel... good! And more than anything it makes me want to pack my bags and go to Tokyo.This is a very different movie experience. But it's an experience that everyone should at least try. I know a lot of people think it's boring, and in a way i can understand why people would think that. For me though, this is not boring, it's magic! I rate it 8/10.",8,1,2,7 February 2005
Pacific Rim," Guillermo del Toro knows his stuff
","I'm always somewhat like a kid on Christmas eve when it comes to Guillermo del Toros movies. I don't expect the world or an eye-opening life-changing experience, but I do expect to be entertained. He has a combination of visual flair, and understanding of how you build an effective action scene (and in extension action movie) which makes a potent cocktail.The plot is pure nonsense, and is rushed by mostly through voice-over right from the start. Seemingly just to get it out of the way. 'Bla bla, giant monsters attack and we build robots to meet them in a boxing-match.' Honestly, most of the plot is not explained much further in the film than in the trailer. Acting ranges between bland and pretty lame, some of the actors are competent performers, but it's not like they are especially challenged in this movie.So, with that out of the way, let's talk essentials. I'm not a fan of the monsters, they look clumsy and lack elegance. Generally though, this movie is beautiful. del Toro knows how to get the adrenaline flowing with visuals and a suitably high-octane soundtrack. Everyone talks tough, walks tough and acts tough. It doesn't always work, and parts of the story feel tacked-on and just an interruption to the action. But mostly though, the movie delivers when it comes to action and excitement.I view this as a guilty pleasure. Something that should appeal mostly to 13-year-olds, and not men three times their age. But still, even though I can't say that I feel like seeing it again, it entertained me for most of the duration.",6,1,2,17 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Still not good enough
","From the original trilogy to Episode 1: The Phantom Menace this film series has become a roller-coaster of quality. The original trilogy is among my all-time favorites while 'The Phantom Menace' is one of the greatest disappointments i have ever had when it comes to movies.Some years have passed since the events in 'The Phantom Menace'. Anakin Skywalker has grown and is now training to soon become a Jedi himself. He and Padmé have a secret romance while he is also acting as her bodyguard. There is trouble in the Republic though as separatists are challenging the senate. This causes some worries because there are not enough Jedi to defend the republic against outright confrontation.I can start by saying that this is a clear improvement on 'The Phantom Menace'. Everything is better. The movie still looks like a video game, but a better quality video game... And the pacing is a lot better. There are no scenes like the 20 minute pod race in 'The Phantom Menace' to completely kill the movie. What still strikes me as abominable though is the casting. Who had the 'bright' idea to cast Hayden Christensen as Anakin?! There has to be thousands of actors in the right age group that can perform better than him. He sounds like an obstinate child every time he says something. Pathetic! What i feel is still missing is the magic. The little thing the original trilogy had that made it work so beautifully even when it was quite silly (i mean come on, midgets in bear-suits?!). Unfortunately this movie is missing that, and when a scene is silly it has no redeeming features. What the 'magic' does is make the whole worth more than the sum of it's parts. And i'm still waiting for that to happen.That said, this is still quite entertaining. And i guess it would be a quite decent sci-fi movie if it didn't have the words 'Star Wars' in the title. But since it DOES have those words, it still falls short of my expectations. I need something better than this. It still shames the original trilogy, and the rating can never be higher than 5/10.",5,38,77,2 February 2005
The Aviator," Enough for an Oscar?
","There is always a little extra excitement involved when seeing a movie that has had a lot of buzz about it before reaching Sweden. And 'The Aviator' is such a movie. Not least because most people are wondering if this is the movie that will finally give Martin Scorsese his Oscar for best director.This is the story of millionaire Howard Hughes. The man who started out with a tool company, began his film-making career with the worlds most expensive film and then went on to become a pioneer in aviation. A story about a manic and intense individual, a man of great success but also one who lived constantly on the edge. And not only is this movie about his life's work but also about his turbulent personal life and the many women he loved.Martin Scorsese has long been a man with a distinct feel when it comes to style. And that is very noticeable here. 'The Aviator' is a beautiful film with a lovingly created world, intense pictures and astonishing sound and music. A delight for the senses. But the movie is also well played with a huge cast of well known and talented actors in both big and small parts. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Howard Hughes, but the strongest star of the movie is still Cate Blanchett. She steals every scene she graces with her appearance.The story of Howard Hughes is fascinating. Not the least because he himself was a fascinating man, but also because of all the famous people that he crossed paths with. Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Erroll Flynn Scorsese treats Howard Hughes with a certain respect, but he doesn't shy away from his less flattering sides. This also means that Scorsese steers away from making an idolized portrait and the movie feels more real, Hughes never feels like a saint.So, about the Oscar. Will this be enough for the 'Best director'-Oscar? My guess is no, unfortunately I believe that Scorsese will once again fall short. That however doesn't mean that this is a bad movie. Far from it. 'The Aviator' is well directed, well played, interesting and entertaining. A recommended viewing, I rate it 7/10.",7,5,9,19 January 2005
Watchmen," Loved it
","I can start out by saying I'm not a fan of graphic novels. It's not that I dislike them, I simply don't read them. I have tried a couple of times, but it has never been my thing. When they get transferred to the big screen though, I find them very appealing. Something about the borderland between realism and unrealism attracts me. Not always of course, but surprisingly often.As you might have gathered from the above, I haven't read the Watchmen graphic novel. But I still find this movie hugely appealing. I love the different characters and I especially love the feel of the movie. I don't mind calling it poetic, and not a little nostalgic. I have to admit I'm not a fan of Zack Snyder otherwise. 300 put me to sleep with it's endless and tedious slow-motion scenes, Man of Steel violated the Superman-legacy completely. This however, is genuinely good.Of course, a lot of the kudos has to go to the actors. A bunch of them are doing a bang-up job, not least Billy Crudup who has one of the more difficult roles as Dr. Manhattan.The movie is not perfect, there is a strange amount of gore which doesn't really fit that well with the movie in general. The plot is slightly unfocused and the ending felt slightly like a 'Meh'. But the movie is vastly enjoyable throughout, and I would rate this as one of my favorite among adaptations of graphic novels. Sin City for instance is more visually appealing and coherent, but this movie has a lot more interesting characters with more depth. I realize though that for fans of the graphic novel, this might be open to another interpretation completely. I also realize that this will not be for everyone. But I urge anyone to give it a try.",8,1,3,30 July 2014
The Village," Hugely disappointing
","M. Night Shyamalan has to be one of the most over-rated directors in Hollywood right now. Not only is he getting paid very good money to make his movies, he more or less makes the same movie again and again. And I for one am getting tired of it.The Village centers around a lonely little Village in the middle of a forest. Around their village they have a fence that marks the border that no one may pass. There are beings in the woods that will take anyone that crosses the border and exact vengeance on the village for the trespassing. But when something horrible happens, what will they do? Will they dare venture for help? As most of Shyamalans films 'The Village' starts out fine. He is adept at creating a mysterious and haunting mood and it works here. For a while at least. Because soon the constant speaking in riddles and constant mentioning of 'those we do not speak of' becomes annoying. Also the pace is terrible. The movie moves onward at a slow crawl and never really picks up pace before the end. Acting is mostly decent but no character really stands out as very interesting.But ultimately where this movie fails is the script-writing. I think it's time for Shyamalan to stay away from writing for a while, to get some new ideas. Because the formula of 'Movie that drags on forever with a twist in the end' is becoming more and more dated. And even more trouble when i could see the plot-twist coming a mile away. 'The Sixth Sense' was a decent thriller, 'Unbreakable' was excellent. But since then Shyamalan has been going downhill. Which unfortunately makes this a waste of talent and money as well as my time.I rate it 3/10.",3,0,4,10 January 2005
Pitch Black," Decent SF
","I saw this at a press showing in Stockholm back when it was first released. Back then i thought it was a decent Sci-fi action movie. Recently i saw it again on DVD (after seeing the horrible train-wreck of a sequel 'The Chronicles of Riddick') and actually liked it more on the second viewing.A ship containing a mixed group of settlers, traveling businessmen, pilgrims and one dangerous captive (and his captor) crash-land on a deserted planet. The planet is a desert wasteland and the survivors try to survive first the heat and then nasty beings that awake when all the planets' three suns are blocked by a total eclipse.'Pitch Black' is nothing special really. It doesn't break any new ground and is not very innovative. Rather the strong point of the movie in my opinion is how much they manage to make out of so little. The ingredients are simple. A crashed ship, a bunch of survivors with different skills, a dangerous convict that creates tensions in the group and finally an alien species bent on killing them. And considering how many movies are made with themes like this 'Pitch Black' feels clearly above average. There is suspense, action, crappy one-liners and CGI to go around and it never really becomes boring.Of course there are weak points as well. I have a hard time accepting Vin Diesel who becomes almost like comic relief with his deep voice and flexing muscles. Also the story is nothing to cheer about although i think it does the job.I would recommend 'Pitch Black' as a Friday night entertainment. It's a lightweight and entertaining no-brainer without being overly stupid or weak. But stay away from the sequel however, it's a completely different experience and shares nothing with this movie except the main character. Goes to show that a large budget can never get you farther than a good script. I rate this 6/10.",6,0,1,14 January 2005
American Psycho," Well worth watching
","American Psycho really struck a chord with me when i first saw it at the theater when it came out in 2000. And after seeing it a couple of times more on DVD i can say that the fascination still lives.I wouldn't call myself a fan of the Brett Easton Ellis book that this movie is based on. While i felt the book did have it's points, i was put off by the overly crude descriptions of violence. While i understood the points Ellis' was trying to make i thought it was excessive and not at all to my tastes. Also the book became somewhat tedious in it's descriptions of pop culture and 1980's phenomena.The movie however i feel has removed much of what put me off with the book. The brutal violence and gore is toned down (but still present enough to get the point through i think) and the references to 1980's culture are more easily and quickly done in the format of a movie. In this way i felt the satire was more pure and focused in the movie, of course many people are likely to think that the experience is diluted because much of the extreme aspects are gone. I do not, however, share this view.The first aspect of the movie that strongly appealed to me was Christian Bale. He's just perfect as the well-cut, rich, successful and utterly insane yuppie Patrick Bateman. The casting overall is excellent, but i must say Bale stands out as something of a sensation.I have seen a lot of discussion on many different message boards about whether the murders in this movie were real, or if they were just a figment of Batemans imagination. My return question is immediately: does it matter? Bret Easton Ellis was on to something when he wrote his book, and that point is further refined here. In a world where every man just cares for himself, and nobody cares about anyone else, it's possible to get away with almost anything. For instance ripping a company apart leaving thousands without a job, or maybe even murder... The idea of the psychopath being allowed to do whatever he pleases without punishment, be it physical or economical harm. To me the concept is what's interesting, not whether he did it or not. The fact that he had fantasies about doing it is enough, the only thing really stopping him was his own inhibitions. Getting away with it was the least of the problems for one who was so inclined.I think that American Psycho will appeal to many people for many different reasons. Some people will see it as plain comedy, others will recognize it more for what it is. I found it interesting and well worth watching, no matter if you have read the book or not. I rate it 7/10.",7,0,2,20 March 2005
"I, Robot"," What would Asimov have thought?
","It seems the latest trend in Hollywood is to slaughter the works of classic Science Fiction-authors. Not a trend i necessarily disapprove of as long as it's done with some respect for the subject matter, and with some quality. I can't help wondering though what Asimov would have thought of this...Del Spooner (Will Smith) is the low-tech policeman investigating a suicide at the company which makes all the household robots in tomorrows society. The man who committed suicide was chief engineer at the company and it seems his death has something to do with the launch of a new generation of robots.The basic philosophical discussion prominent in Asimovs novel is not entirely removed here. The discussion of what intelligence and 'life' is can still be seen. But soon enough it more or less evaporates and this becomes a modern action movie. The special effects do, not surprisingly, look amazing and the action scenes are very well made. I felt Will Smith was a bit miscast here. He doesn't handle the jaded cop routine very well, most of the time it just looks like he's flirting instead of being world-weary. But i guess this is a minor complaint.So, what is this? Well this is a slaughtered Asimov-novel turned into a pompous action movie. Is it bad? Not at all. Rather i enjoyed this movie quite a lot. And i think it proves that it's not necessary to follow the original work perfectly as long as you make something good with the idea. An example of a slaughtered novel that went wrong is 'Paycheck' which was simply terrible because they deviated from the original story without having any good ideas of their own.So watch this expecting not philosophy or Asimov-like discussions, rather a well made and entertaining action movie. I rate it 6/10.",6,0,0,16 February 2005
BASEketball," Funny
","Sometimes you see a movie and you know that it's stupid. You know that it's childish to laugh at it, and that it's not really THAT funny. But still you can't help yourself and constantly find your self laughing.. This is that kind of movie.Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) and Doug Remer (Matt Stone) are two friends from school who are heading to a reunion when the movie starts. They are both losers and everyone else at the reunion seems to have made something out of themselves. Then they get dared to play basketball against two other guys. They then proceed to invent their own game where you don't have to run or break a sweat... Soon this game becomes a huge hit under the name 'Baseketball' (mix between Basketball and Baseball).If you've seen a David Zucker-outing before you know roughly what to expect. Like in the Naked Gun the comedy is fast and often below the belt. What really works to this films advantage is Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Their comical timing is excellent and they seem to really enjoy themselves. I'm quite surprised how well they work here!So, this IS really funny if you overlook the fact that it's more than a little childish. I rate it 6/10.",Null,1,2,25 November 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Arguably best action movie ever made
","Every time i see this movie i am amazed at how well it still stands the test of time. When i first saw it i felt it was the best action movie ever made, and i still think that when i see it today. The pace, the effects, the music, the pulse raising action...The story is probably known to most people. Two machines come back from the future looking for John Connor. One of them to protect him, one to kill him. Both because of what he will become later in life, the leader of the resistance against the machines.To begin with, the casting is perfect. Arnold Schwarzenegger is his usual mechanical self, Robert Patrick is brilliant as the evil liquid-metal T1000. Edward Furlong has just the right amount of cockiness to pull off the part of the troubled John Connor. And Linda Hamilton is simply amazing as the hardest woman on screen since Ripley in Aliens.But what makes this film so great? It's the special touch that James Cameron seems to have. His ability to turn a great budget into a great film (instead of just an overblown b-movie like for instance the horrible 'Chronicles of Riddick'). He uses the millions of dollars in an intelligent way and makes a truly magnificent action movie. He can make your heart pound like few others as the movie races to it's magnificent finale. I don't know exactly how Cameron does it, or what it is he has, but i can say this: it's a shame he doesn't make action films any more.So if you're tired of all the modern action films failing to deliver. All those movies with high budgets and big explosions that still refuses to make your heart pound, then revisit Terminator 2. It's the best there is (in competition with perhaps 'Aliens') and i have a hard time seeing how any movie could surpass this one in the near future. It's a 9/10 and as recommended as can be.",Null,1,1,19 November 2004
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," It could have been better
","Honestly i have very little patience with spoofs like this one. The kind of movie that is both a spoof and serious at the same time. Sure it's a spoof of movies like 'Walk The Line', and at the same time it's not all comedy, but rather adapts the same sort of style as serious movies, but with scenes of comedy thrown in. I thought it worked better in 'Walk Hard' than it usually does, but it's far from perfect.Starting with the good i can say that i always enjoy John C. Reilly. His comical timing and ability to stay serious while doing hilarious things is just great. Letting him be the star rather than the sidekick (like he usually is) is not a bad idea. Undoubtedly he has the talent to pull it off. The second good thing is that there are some scenes in this movie that are hilarious. Especially the scenes where Reillys band-member played by Tim Meadows tries to talk him out of using drugs (usually by saying how good they make you feel). Also a few of the songs are really great, good enough to be taken seriously in their own right.The major problem i had with this movie really is the sort of episode-like structure. This is not so strange considering it's something the movie inherited from Walk The Line. It starts out when Reilly's character is little, and then shows a bunch of scenes from his career. The problem is that those scenes are far too uneven in quality. Some of them are quite good (like the scene with The Beetles), while other scenes are just boring and lackluster (mostly the childhood-scenes). In some instances the movie feels more like a line of sketches rather than a complete movie.In the end i think it's a very thin line to walk for a movie like this one. Finding the balance between comedy, music, and serious scenes is difficult. Sometimes this is almost pure slapstick, other times it's almost as serious as Walk The Line. I enjoyed this movie, but i can't help feeling it could have been done better. John C. Reilly frankly deserves better. I rate this 6/10.",6,1,4,24 March 2008
Van Helsing," Disastrous
","I know Stephen Sommers had previously directed 'The Mummy' (which i enjoyed) and i knew this would not be a film for the Oscars so to speak. My expectations were rather low in other words, or rather i was expecting an entertaining adventure ride since Sommers could previously deliver on that. But Van Helsing is not an entertaining ride. It's a train-wreck!Van Helsing is the Vatican's premier monster-hunter. Now the Valerious family is in trouble. They swore that they would destroy the vampire Dracula, if they didn't none of their family-members would ever enter heaven. Now only two members of the family remain and Van Helsing must help them, otherwise the family will be doomed forever.Van Helsing sure doesn't lack action. There is shooting, fencing, kicking and fighting going on throughout the whole running time. It also doesn't lack CGI as almost every scene is filled with CGI of a varying quality. Some of it looks exceptionally good, while some of it is simply terrible. Maybe they ran out of money somewhere?Of the actors, Hugh Jackman is the only one that really works in his role as Van Helsing. Probably because he seems relaxed and at ease. Everybody else is terrible. Especially Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious and Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. Their characters are a mess of stiff acting and horrible accents.Still. The acting is a minor distraction in this mess. Worse is the complete lack of coherence. Everybody runs around, screaming and fighting, and you never ever get a feel for a single character or what the movie is about. Rather it's loosely connected action scenes put on top of each other. I feel that if i had seen this while i was still 12 years old i may have liked it. But now it's just a lot of noise with no substance. I rate it 3/10 and hope they never make a sequel.",Null,1,2,26 November 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Steve Carell
","Just reading the title you know that this movie will depend heavily on comedy based in embarrassment. The embarrassment of being 40 years old without having done the business, as well as the embarrassment of trying at that age. In the worst case scenario this could have been awful, it could have been degrading in a way that makes me at least turn off the TV. This is luckily not the worst case.I have to admit right away that i for some reason like Steve Carell. His whole appearance is just amazing. Seeing him finally outside the newscaster-role is great. You might say 'But he was already in The Office'. Then i say: i wouldn't watch that crap even if i was paid to. There is only one boss in 'The Office' and that's Ricky Gervais. Anyway, i got sidetracked. Let's get on with it.Carell lends a certain warmth to his character here. He's not such a bad guy. He's just an insecure man who lives his life pretty much alone in the same way he has since he was fifteen years old. He collects action figures, plays video games and watches movies. He seldom goes out and never ever meets women. Basically he's the man most guys could have been if they hadn't met that first girlfriend. Which makes him human, and also it makes us pity him and feel for him when he goes through his embarrassing stages on the road to getting laid.The jokes and comedy in this movie is of a shifting quality. There are moments that are intensely funny and there are also many sly remarks that are great. The most fun are Carells work-buddies who make it the purpose of their lives to get him laid. And even though it becomes too much sometimes and they overstep the line, it never becomes truly disgusting or repulsive. Which is a feat considering the subject.Steve Carell makes this movie worth a five, his buddies makes it worth a six, and the fact that it's a movie about sex that doesn't end in a disgustingly cute way it's worth a seven. It's a laugh and sometimes that's all you need.",7,0,0,14 May 2006
Face_Off," Perfect mix
","John Woo has always been one of my favorite action directors. And this is somewhat of his crowning achievement. The perfect mix between Hollywood and Hong Kong you might say.The terrorist and criminal Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) has placed a dirty bomb somewhere. Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has been chasing Troy for a long time and now he is close to catching him. But things go out of control and Troy falls into a coma. Now the only person who knows the location of the bomb is Troys brother Pollux. Now Archer has to go undercover looking like Troy to get his brother to reveal the location of the bomb.This movie has a story that stretches reality quite a bit. But in the end that doesn't really matter. Because this might be the ultimate action movie. Why? Simply because John Woo here manages to mix his Hong Kong-brand of action sequences with the plot and acting of Hollywood. Both Travolta and Cage are majestic as the two enemies. And this is bullet ballet as it's best. Woo uses every trick in the book. Slow-motion, dual pistols and a pace that never lets you up for air.Unlike Woo's Hong Kong outings (most notably The Killer and Hard-boiled) this movie has a story that holds together though, and the actors to pull it off. The disturbing elements of confusing plot turns that are almost always present in Hong Kong are also gone. Allt this combines in making this one of my top-three action movies of all time.I rate this 8/10.",8,2,4,23 January 2005
Jarhead," Different
","War movies are a difficult genre. The trick is to avoid both being overly patriotic and heroic, as well as avoiding being too negative. It seems to me that most war movies are made with either one of those two agendas, pro-war or anti-war. Both movies bore me really, it can work when the style is more oriented towards satire though.'Jarhead' is different in the way that it stays clear of both agendas mentioned above. Based on the autobiography of a marine who served in the Gulf war, it tries to show the life of the individual marine. Staying away from politics is usually a good idea, especially when dealing with something fairly recent like the Gulf war. In scenes reminiscent of 'Full Metal Jacket' we get to follow soldiers when they go through training and then we get to see them preparing for the war in the desert. A war that never seems to reach them.If you expect an action-filled war movie in the vein of say 'Black Hawk Down' you will be sorely disappointed. This is a much more bleak and, i believe, more realistic look at how the modern foot soldier experiences war. He's been replaced in many ways by machines like tanks and, above all, airplanes. And in the end boredom is his worst enemy.Even though boredom is a prevalent theme throughout 'Jarhead', the movie is never boring in my opinion. Rather it's an interesting look at pretty regular people that find themselves in an extraordinary situation, a situation that puts all their expectations to shame. Aside from the story 'Jarhead' is also a very solid movie technically. The photography is beautiful, the music is well chosen and the direction from Sam Mendes is flawless. The acting is also above average from most of the actors, even Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty good. The one that stood out most though in my opinion was Jamie Foxx.'Jarhead' is a very untraditional war movie and that makes it worth watching all by itself. But it's also interesting, well made and contains some great acting. A war movie that probably appeals more to people who usually don't enjoy war movies.",7,1,2,17 January 2006
Collateral," Excellent
","I enjoyed 'Collateral' quite a bit. Not that surprising maybe since i consider Michael Mann a very competent, but maybe not that exciting, director.'Collateral' has a few things going for it. First of all it has a story and script that is original without being revolutionary. Also it's reasonably plausible without becoming dull or too focused on staying true to reality. With this script the movie could have been a decent thriller. However there are two things that lift this movie and make it better than decent. The first of which are the actors, the second the directing.Tom Cruise is something of a mystery to me. I have trouble standing him when he does his frantic noisy parts, like in 'Jerry Maguire'. But as soon as he comes to his senses and keeps it down he can be excellent. He is very good in 'Collateral', better than i thought he could be in a part like this one. It doesn't feel like familiar Tom Cruise territory to say the least. Still though Tom Cruise is still Tom Cruise and i expect some quality from him. The one who surprised me was Jamie Foxx. I still feel that somewhere along the line i missed something with this guy. One day he was the irritating guy in 'Any Given Sunday' or the loser in 'Booty Call'. Next day he's excellent in movies like this one, and perhaps most notably in 'Ray'. The chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise is perhaps the biggest key to why this movie works.I also mentioned the direction. There is a sense of style to everything that Michael Mann does. Even if i find him rather dull sometimes i can't deny his talent and his sensitive fingertips. Here the visual style, the music and the pace is mixed in an excellent way. Scenes that could have been pathetic are carried with a steady hand by Mann, all the way through the rather weak ending.So, what about flaws? This movie is not a ten, so what's wrong with it? Well, for one i DID find the ending to be weak. It just didn't live up to the rest of the movie. Of course i can't really say any more without ruining it for you. But still. Also there is the thing about originality, but that is a minor thing.So, even though this is not one of the most original movies in recent years i think most people will enjoy it. I found it to be a display of excellent film-making, acting and directing. While a few more elements of chance and surprise would have spiced things up, this is still well worth watching and one of the best thrillers of 2004.I rate it 7/10.",7,0,0,1 April 2005
The Machinist," Interesting
","I saw this film at the Stockholm International Film Festival in November 2004. In the audience was director Brad Anderson, and i think he very much appreciated how the film was received by the rest of the audience. And this film was well worth the applause.This film is about a man (Christian Bale) working in a heavy industry. He suffers from insomnia and hasn't slept for a year. This condition is causing him to lose weight, and his perception of reality to become twisted. Soon he doesn't know what's real or not.I won't elaborate any more on the plot since it could really spoil the film for you. There are some twists and turns along the way that might not be all that obvious and you should be able to enjoy them without being told too much. What i can say though is that the story is in no way revolutionary. A couple of films have been made in the same vein as this one, the most famous perhaps being Memento and Fight Club. And 'The Machinist' shares elements from both these films but still, i think, manages to create an identity of it's own.But aside from the story, Christian Bale really steals the show. Having seen him in his previous films it's hard to be prepared for what he looks like here. For this film he has turned himself into a walking skeleton, a run-down shadow of a man. And his performance is, throughout the movie, mesmerizing. I have ever since American Psycho been fully convinced of Bale's talents as an actor, and this further proves his talent and commitment. The rest of the cast also do a good job, strengthening the overall strange mood of the film.Although i thoroughly enjoyed this film i understand it's not for everyone. This is not the least proved by the fact that Brad Anderson (as he stated in the interview after the screening) could not get funding for it in America. Instead he had to go to Spain to make the film the way he wanted to. And i'm not surprised, this is not your standard Hollywood fare. But for those of us who enjoy films that go beyond the will to suit everyone (and make loads of money) this is a rewarding experience. I rate it 7/10.",Null,281,320,21 November 2004
Aliens," Stunning
","It's always harder for me to comment on the movies i really love, than the movies i didn't even like. Which makes this VERY hard. Aliens is along with Terminator 2 probably the two action films that for me define the genre. And these two also collaborate in making James Cameron, in my eyes, the still undisputed king of action blockbusters. The one man who can have a huge budget and make an action film where every dollar still feels well spent.The story here is more or less an excuse to reunite the two factors we want to see reunited after the first Alien-movie made in 1979: Ripley and the Alien. Ripley wakes up in the beginning of 'Aliens', having drifted through space for nearly 60 years after the first movie. Her reports of the alien creature is met with skepticism from 'The Company', that she used to work for. But something must have stirred, they sent someone out to check on her story. And things begin to happen, they lose contact with a colony and are forced to take the matter seriously. Soon Ripley and some of earths finest marines are heading out to take control of the situation. And this time it's war.How do you make the perfect action movie? Well, don't ask me. Ask James Cameron! Because this is a close to perfect as we are ever likely to come. The music, the weapons, the vehicles, the characters, the pulse-raising pace, the aliens and last but not least (the ultimate queen of action) Ripley! Everything work together to make this a crushing experience. It's sadly not often you see something like this, something so exhausting you break sweat just by watching it.Admittedly some of the effects look rather dated today. Especially the scenes of the landing shuttle and the spaceship. But in all honesty it doesn't bother me at all. For what this movie lacks in modern-day CGI it more than makes up for in pure action. It doesn't matter how many well-made CGI-creatures more recent films throw at you, none of them are as menacing or as frightening as H.R. Gigers Alien-monster. And while there was just one creature in the first movie, there are swarms of them here. All closing in on the small group of humans...So, watch this and prepare for the ride of a lifetime. In the director's cut (which is the version you want to see if possible) it's 154 minutes of pure adrenalin rush. This is probably the only time i will ever do this, but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do: i rate this 10/10.",10,1,2,20 November 2004
Saw III," The charm is waning
","Sequels are a funny thing (or a tragic thing, depending on who you ask). It seems that the formula for sequels in Hollywood is 'more is more', not 'less is more'. So with SAW that formula equates sicker traps, sicker games and of course more blood. In that regard, the third movie is a completely logical step.What i liked about this movie is the whole set that they have built. It's a really disgusting warped reality with rotten pigs, disgusting smells (i imagine) and plenty of rooms with sick games. This time two people have been kidnapped for apparent and not so apparent reasons. The formula is basically the same, although the characters are beginning to reach the end of their arc. Amanda is obviously deranged and Jigsaw in worse shape than ever. Also that's one of the things i found quite admirable, that the film-makers were actually able to keep any interest in what was basically rather simple characters to begin with. Sure, Jigsaw had a motivation and an idea, but that didn't exactly make him three-dimensional. But here i find myself actually caring what happens.What i didn't like so much was that the level of disgusting effects and gore has been turned up another notch or two. Most of all i felt it was quite unnecessary. The amount of blood in the first movie was quite enough, the amount in the second movie was pushing it, and here it's excessive. I guess most of the audience (at least the real fans) won't think so though, so i understand why they do it.This is not a bad movie. It's not as entertaining as the first two though. Mostly because the charm of the concept is really beginning to wane. I would say that this should be the last movie in the series, but i know that there is already at least one more film in the making. I doubt that i would watch that one though, to me the SAW-franchise has been milked enough (and then some) after this movie. I rate this 5/10.",5,1,2,10 July 2007
Spirited Away," Amazing!
","I can't say that i'm a huge fan of animated movies. Sure i did enjoy Shrek immensely and also Pixars outings the last few years. But still i felt i was able to appreciate those movies despite the fact that they were animated, not because they were.'Spirited Away' is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time. I don't really know what it was that appealed so much to me here, it's something that might be hard to capture. But more than anything i would put it down to the amazing attention to detail. There are simply so many funny and peculiar creatures and figures in this movie. The whole movie just oozes with joy. Sometimes i get that feeling when watching a movie, like if the film-makers enjoyed themselves immensely while making the movie. I get that feeling here, there are just so many good ideas.The animation itself is strange in the same way that Japanese animation often is. It's quite far removed both from the regular Disney-style animation as well as from the computer-animation of Pixars movies. It's a style hard to describe since it seems like a mix between different styles as well. It looks nice though and works very well.I could write a lot more about this movie, but i won't. This is not a movie to read about, it's a movie to watch! I rate it 7/10.",7,1,4,3 April 2005
Pearl Harbor," Sleep-inducing
","It seems that this movie is one of the most hated movies ever made (at least reading comments here on IMDb and also listening to people commenting on it elsewhere). But then there's the other crowd who truly enjoyed it and thought it was among the best war epics ever. Myself, i must say that i have seldom seen a movie that felt so much like an endurance test. I was chewing on my seat just to have something to do while sitting in the theater.The problems with this movie are numerous and of catastrophic proportions. While a lot could be said about the atrocious acting and overly pompous style of the movie, that is not the main flaw. Rather the script is the main offender. Seeing that writer Randall Wallace has also written such epic manure as 'We were soldiers' and 'The man in the iron mask' comes as no real surprise. The scriptwriting here is terrible, and it's completely insane that the demands for the script were not higher on a movie budgeted at over 135 million dollars. Basically this is a script and story worthy of a porn movie. It's one hour build-up, one hour massacre and one hour slowdown in the end. Unbearably boring is the key-word for all three sequences.Because the main problem with this movie is not the keen patriotism, the laughable 'acting' from Ben Affleck or the sappy love themes. No it's the combination of all these. It's not awful like 'We were soldiers', nor is it crap in a 'bad but entertaining' way. Rather it's just an insufferable bore. The only part of the movie where i was not half-unconscious was during the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. In that sequence one could easily see where the 135 million dollars went...Maybe it's just me. But still i personally feel that demands should be a little higher on a movie that cost as much as this one. The least i should be able to demand is that i don't fall asleep in my chair! I rate this 3/10 with an extra point added because it can be used as a substitute for Valium.",3,10,18,28 February 2005
Resident Evil," Uninteresting
","I'm no fan of the Resident Evil video games. I have played them but i found them to be quite tedious and slow. Not bad, but nothing that didn't feel like 'Alone in the dark' hadn't already done it years ago on the Amiga.The research complex called 'The Hive' is buried deep under ground. Now a virus have gotten loose there that has caused the hive to close itself. A special military unit is going in to investigate.I was of course skeptical when i saw who directed this movie. The Antichrist of b-action Paul W.S. Anderson. And here he does it again, the same thing he almost always does. Turns the movie into crap. And there are several reasons for this.First of all Milla Jovovich is completely wrong in the hero part. Going to war in a mini skirt is ridiculous to begin with, and it just becomes even worse from there. The cinematography is surprisingly OK as are most of the special effects. But the action scenes completely lack any kind of tension or pulse. It's just people firing weapons while REALLY loud heavy metal music is playing, but there is no real excitement. This is typical of Paul W.S. Andersons movies though. The lack of any pulse in the action scenes. Seldom have so many fired bullets and so much fighting felt so incredibly slow.So why watch this? Well it's not recommended. I don't know how it compares with the video games as i don't know the games well enough. But i do know that standing on it's own this is an inferior action movie. There are a few tolerable scenes and a couple of moments that lift this a bit above the lowest mark. But in the end you can do something better with your time. I rate this 3/10.",3,1,2,7 February 2005
Independence Day," Entertaining
","Sometimes it's hard not liking a movie even though it has so many things to dislike. 'Independence Day' is one of those movies.I remember when the trailer came out for this movie. It was one of the best trailers i'd seen back then. Simply because it really made med want to see the movie. Everything about it just seemed so cool. And i guess when i saw it at the theater i was not disappointed. It was a fun ride. And seeing it now a couple of years later i may not enjoy it as much as i did, but i can sure understand why i enjoyed it the first time around.Because let's face it. Plausibility is exceptionally low here. Goofs are present in almost every shot. The dialog is a joke, the characters are caricatures and the plot is basically 'War of the worlds' moved to present day. But still, like a video game that may be stupid but can still entertain this is not so bad. Admittedly though the movie loses most of it's entertainment value as it slows down toward the end. But up until then it's a lot of fun.It feels like most people who disliked this movie did so for rather strange reasons. It seems they expected something completely different from what they got. This is a classic matinée movie about peoples fear of the unknown. A classic genre no matter if the unknown factor is Aliens or Russians or whatever. This movie is not trying to be smart, only entertaining. And while the dosage of dull and pompous American self-pride is a little too high, it still manages to rise above it and entertain most of the time.And when i see a movie like this one i first and foremost want to be entertained. That's why i rate this movie a 6/10 despite it's faults, goofs and general silliness.",6,0,1,21 February 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Not as bad as i feared, but not good
","I´m sure that director Paul W.S. Anderson does whatever he can with his films. He seems like a nice enough guy, and very enthusiastic about each project. But he has yet to make a single movie i found enjoyable and this is yet another good idea wasted.While it can be argued that part of the problems with this film is not Paul W.S. Anderson (a PG-13 rating, substandard acting) he has still made yet another bland and unexciting actionfilm. I love the first two Alien-films, as well as the first Predator-film. And to mix these two is one of the first truly exciting ideas i´ve heard when it comes to mixing franchises. It´s sad to see though that all the good vibrations from both series of films are wasted here.So, what´s wrong with this film? Well it´s not cheap-looking and boring (like Resident Evil) nor is it a total catastrophe in every way (like Mortal Kombat). It´s just... bland. The action scenes are few. And the pacing is slow, especially in the beginning of the film. When the action scenes DO happen they don´t look too bad although the lack of gore effects is obvious. But i feel that the gore is not the main thing missing, the film would have benefited much more from better editing and more frequent, and longer lasting, action scenes. What made 'Aliens' so great? Was it the gore? No, it was the way the action-scenes just throbbed with energy. An energy severely lacking here.Probably this will spell the end for both the Alien and Predator franchises (or at least for any future films mixing them) which is sad because they deserve better. With a proper director, and a rating adjusted to the kind of film this SHOULD be, this could have been the action-film of the year. Now, it´s just sad.I give this 4/10.",Null,0,0,3 September 2004
Batman Begins," Could have been so much more
","I can't say i'm a huge fan of the Batman franchise. Since i have basically no interest in comic books i'm usually also quite free from expectations based on comics. I do enjoy a good comic book adaption though so i don't mind watching a movie like Batman Begins. Seeing as how the actors and director were both talented i must admit my hopes were rather high. Unfortunately this movie is ultimately a disappointment.I love movies based on comic books. Which might sound strange considering i don't like comic books themselves. And maybe it's strange, but still there is something about the over-the-top playfulness that should always be an element in comic-book adaptations that appeals to me. Christopher Nolan who directed Batman Begins has not done anything like it before, but then again neither had Bryan Singer before he made X-men, and just look how well that turned out. It's my firm belief that a truly talented director can make almost any kind of movie. And has Nolan succeeded? Well, both yes and no i would say.The first part of this movie was very much to my liking. The background of how Batman came to be Batman, as well as the background to where he gets all his lovely toys and his neat cave. Christian Bale is a good actor and the supporting cast is also excellent so there is no problem with the fact that there is not much action in the first half. Rather the problems start when the action starts... The action scenes are dark, messy and not very well done at all. Effects-laden and with a lot of kicking and punching without us seeing very much of what's going on. Maybe a testament to Nolan not being used to action-films? In the end there is just too much lacking from this film for it to be truly successful. The script feels like it's been re-written somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the studio thought people wouldn't see a Batman-movie without constant action-scenes? In the end it feels like two movies in one, and the first part is by far the best. The actors are superb and most of them do an excellent job. Bale is great as Batman (the best Batman so far alongside Michael Keaton), Michael Cane is enjoyable as his butler and Liam Neeson offer as solid a performance as ever. So what's missing? Well apart from the story more or less disappearing in all the explosions in the end i really miss the super-villain in this movie. There is just not enough madness to go around.To make a long story short this is not a failure as such. Rather it's more the feeling that it could have been so much more that bugs me. A promising start is dragged down by inefficient action-scenes and i feel this movie deserved better. It's a 6/10 for the effort.",6,1,3,3 September 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Mixed feelings
","I have mixed feelings about this movie. While it is clearly one of the better WW2-movies to come out the last decades it must still be one of the most overrated films ever.A small group of soldiers set out to find a paratrooper, private Ryan, who has landed behind enemy lines in Normandy. The reason is that Ryans brothers have all died in the war and now the army will try to bring Ryan home so that at least one son in the family can be brought home to his mother alive.I said in the beginning of this review that this movie is overrated. And i stand by that comment. This movie has received a rating of over 8 here on IMDb which i think is preposterous. What this movie has that makes it very good (although not great) is the battle scenes. They are simply the best i have ever seen. The adrenaline rush, the shaky close-ups, the gore. Seldom has the complete terror of battle been captured this well. Those scenes are worth a rating of 10. But the rest of the movie? That is where the problems begin. Because the story is rather dull and unbelievable. And the pace is at times very slow. But more than anything the characters disturb me. They act like idiots. I don't know if the soldiers in World War 2 acted this stupid, or if this is some strange addition by director Steven Spielberg.My point in the end is that this movie contain great elements, but they alone do not make this a great movie. When all is said and done i give this movie a rating of 6, that could have been 8 if the story had been stronger and the characters more believable.",6,2,3,19 January 2005
2012," No more
","Disaster movies is very far from my favorite genre. Ever since i first watched the disaster movies from the 70's as a kid i have had trouble with them. And watching '2012' i can't say that the genre has come a long way since the 70's either. Sure the movie looks better, but beyond that? So, what are the positives here? Well, the movie does have some pretty good special effects. Of course they are over-done and over-used, but that's the way you have to play it with a movie like this one. Also you have some pretty good actors doing their best with the material. I also found the movie quite entertaining until all hell broke loose...The negatives are, however, easier to point out. Honestly, Roland Emmerich is one of the most uninteresting directors of our time. He seldom makes anything interesting, usually it's just sentimental and clichéd, effect-driven movies. Not my cup of tea to say the least, and to top it off this movie is like regular Emmerich on steroids... The whole world is literally destroyed in this movie, entire cities ground to dust. And in-between the scenes of destruction are moral preachings and sentimental scenes that are quite hard to stomach. The movie follows a well trodden path and a strict formula, and how exciting is that? Not very.In the end i think this movie shows two things. Firstly that disaster movies are still unbearably boring to watch. Secondly that special effects can be used to do anything today, which ultimately make the effects less special. I remember watching Jurassic Park when it came out. I was completely mesmerized with the special effects, they actually made the dinosaurs come alive! But today, special effects are nothing to be excited about. They are everywhere and a heavy use of CGI is expected in every big-budget movie. And unless there is something behind all the effects; a great story or at least some substance, the effects amount to nothing. They days when i watched movies just because of the special effects are over.So hopefully this is the last cry of the shallow, special-effects laden Hollywood-movie. Now they have destroyed the entire world with millions of pixels and huge detail, so we have seen basically everything. Now they have to wow us with something else. And even as i write this i know it's not what's going to happen. Crap like this will be released next year too.But i won't watch it.",3,4,6,25 January 2010
Ghost Rider," Not good
","I'm usually very tolerant when it comes to comic-book movies. For some reason i like them even though i don't particularly like comic books. I guess it's the way that they can bend reality with an alibi to do so, as opposed to when they do it in a regular action movie. In the end though rocking action scenes, or a good solid story, is needed to make it work. There are loads of examples of movies that did work with different approaches. Like comedy (Spider-man), action (X-Men) and emotion/story (Hulk by Ang Lee). This movie however doesn't really have an approach...I can freely admit to never having heard of the character Ghostrider before this movie. And i'm not surprised, it's not a very interesting character. And it works less well in a live-action movie. Considering the Ghostrider is basically just a special-effect with a flaming skull, there's not much acting to be done. Nicholas Cage is his usual self as the troubled man who turns into Ghostrider at night. Whether Nicholas Cage being himself is a good thing or not is up to you to decide. The rest of the performances range from dignified (Peter Fonda) to downright silly (Wes Bentley).The real problem here is not the acting though, it's the fact that the movie has precious little to offer. It lacks direction and purpose almost completely. It's too slow and lame to be a good action-movie (although there are a few decent special-effects scenes), it lacks comedy almost completely and the story is too lame and shallow to carry the movie. I guess going for the action-angle would have been the best way, but the Ghostrider doesn't really have any interesting ways to fight. He punches people, strangles them with chains and looks deep into their eyes. The fact that the money seems to have run before they got the flaming-skull effect right doesn't help either.The thing i was thinking when the movie was over was 'Spawn' from 1997. This movie reminded me so much about Spawn that it could easily have been a sequel. Both movies are very heavy on special effects (although this one is obviously light-years better in that department, or well, ten regular years...), both have an anti-hero with connections to the devil, both seriously lack weight in the action-scenes. And in the end both of them are thoroughly dull, and while they make a lot of noise, they have precious little to offer in the way of entertainment.I rate this 3/10.",3,2,4,26 September 2007
Hellboy," Highly entertaining
","Guillermo del Toro proved his feeling for comic-book styled action with Blade 2. So it's maybe no surprise that this movie is also full of just that: feeling.Hellboy is the story of a demon who came to earth as a child. He was part of Rasputins evil plan to destroy humanity, but the demon child was rescued and raised to good instead. Now he, and a bunch of other special heroes, fight the occult evils in modern day society. Rasputin is back though, and he has other plans for Hellboy...There are a couple of factors that make this one of the most successful comic-book adventures i've seen so far in terms of style. First of all the casting is perfect throughout. Ron Perlman is very entertaining as Hellboy, and the other parts of the cast are equally up to their tasks. The special effects are also excellent, among the better i've seen actually. The action sequences are also well done without being too excessive. But mostly it's the feeling for what does and does not work that strikes me with this movie. Guillermo Del Toro seems to really like the genre and know exactly what he wanted out of this film.Of course there are also flaws as always. For instance the movie becomes a little silly sometimes, and a bit more action wouldn't have hurt i think. Mostly though i feel the ending, without saying too much, is sort of an anticlimax. But all in all this is very entertaining in a way that comic-book action should be. I rate it 7/10.",Null,4,5,26 November 2004
I Am Legend," Not awful, but not great
","Sitting down in the theater to watch what is basically another zombie-movie didn't feel all that appealing. But 'I Am Legend' seemed to have a few things going for it. Like a being based on an actual novel, like having nice cinematography and a style that seemed appealing. In the end though, i found that this movie had serious trouble rising above mediocrity.We can start with the good. This movie has a few things really going for it. It looks gorgeous to begin with. The empty and partly overgrown streets of New York are awesome. The visual style is generally very nice and atmospheric. Second the music is great. Both the score and the very well-picked songs add to the mood of the movie. The third thing i liked was actually Will Smith. I'm not one of his biggest fans, although i do think he has some talent, not least in comedy roles. Here though he carries the first half of the movie quite admirably. After that, the whole thing degenerates in a way that not even the best actor could save.The actually brings me to the bad points. In general, people have been saying that the first two thirds of the movie were great, the last third awful. In most parts i can agree, although i would say that the first two thirds were good, and the ending disappointing. Honestly i can't say that this would have become a favorite of mine even with a good ending. But the ending they chose for this movie must have been one of the worst choices they could have. Since they didn't seem to follow the book that closely, they could easily have remodeled the ending to something a lot better. One of the other things that bothered me were the zombies (or 'Dark Seekers' as they call them) themselves. They are a mess of decent quality CGI that somehow turns quite awful in a few scenes. This is not the first time that movies have shown fluctuating quality in it's CGI, but i'm wondering where it comes from. If you have a big budget it shouldn't be that difficult to make the quality decent through the whole movie.In the end this movie didn't really appeal to me that much. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. I almost always have a problem with movies that are basically one-man shows. I loathed 'Cast Away' for instance due to the fact that Hanks is far from good enough to carry a whole movie. It worked better in this movie due to the fact that Will Smith had more things to interact with, but it's still a problem. Also the whole 'zombie-virus' thing feels explored already. We have 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later which are both better movies on basically the same theme. I think it's time that Hollywood left the zombie-theme alone for a while and started on something else. This is getting repetitive.",6,1,2,16 February 2008
Hero," Beautiful but no masterpiece
","It seems that Hero has really appealed to many people in the west, which is not so strange considering this is a very 'western' take on Chinese cinema. Zhang Yimou was already a famous and successful director before Hero, but this is sure to bring his work to a bigger audience.I was fortunate enough to see Hero on the big screen which is really the way it ought to be seen. This is simply the most beautiful film i have ever seen, the photography is magnificent. Also the attention to detail is quite magnificent, every scene is as carefully composed as a classic painting. In the end, the visuals alone make Hero worth experiencing.The story in Hero revolves around a couple of assassins and their attempt to assassinate the king of Qin. In the early days of China several kings fought for control over the land, and the king of Qin was the mightiest and most aggressive one. In the end he would be the one to unite the whole of China under one ruler. The story is told in segments as the local magistrate 'Nameless' (Jet Li) tells the king of how he thwarted the assassins who would try to take his life.The story in Hero is by no means unique, it is a story told in quite many films and the tale of the emperor who united China is a common one (see for instance 'The Emperor and the assassin' from 1999). What makes Hero rise above is the stylish and beautiful way the story is told. Also, many of the actors do a commendable work.When it comes to comparisons my first (and obvious) choice is 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' which also has a style very well suited to western audiences. When i compare the two i find Crouching Tiger to be the superior one. This because of the one true flaw in Hero; the way the surface becomes more important than the depth. While there was more depth, emotion and warmth in Crouching Tiger, there is less so in Hero despite the love story. In the end it becomes too much of a style-study more than a complete experience which somewhat lessens my appreciation for the film. More heart and less polish is what i would have wanted for the grade to rise a couple of notches.However, Hero is a rewarding experience and a must-see. For the amazing visuals if not for anything else. I rate it 6/10.(I have refrained from commenting the often discussed 'political message' in Hero, simply because i feel there is none. This is a legend filled with nationalism just like any other legend about a nations birth. Get over yourselves.)",Null,0,1,30 October 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Frantic
","I hate musicals. Well, not all of them but almost. That's also why i put off watching this one for years. Simply because i didn't think i could possibly enjoy it. And did i? Well. Let's see.Baz Luhrmann has made the more or less 'hysterical' film-making his thing. And this is certainly quite hysterical. The pace is admirably high throughout, but also skillfully kept at a level where we still have energy to keep watching. Luhrmanns feeling for visuals and audio is impeccable. Making this an experience that assaults the senses in a very dramatic way. I must admit though that even though the movie seemed to do everything available to keep the viewers interest up, the frantic pace got the best of me in the end. The last 15-20 minutes were rather painfully prolonged.So what about the music? This is a musical after all. Well, the songs were quite sing-a-long friendly. I felt like breaking out singing myself several times. Especially when hearing the sometimes quite painfully weak voice of Ewan McGregor. Maybe it was not THAT bad, but i was not impressed. Otherwise the singing as well as the picking of music was top-notch. A lot of classic songs that might not fit that well into the 1900's Paris, but perfectly into the burlesque mood of the film, mixed nicely with brand new material.So, what's the verdict. Well i must say this movie was not really for me. While i enjoyed it more than your typical musical it was still just too frantic and bizarre for my tastes. The acting was OK and the music was great, but still it's too much for me. I guess many people love this, but i give it an average rating. Knowing that my taste is the real problem here. 5/10.",5,1,4,21 February 2005
The Illusionist," I liked it
","Sometimes it's good to see movies that are not too pretentious, not too full of themselves. I don't know exactly how you spot them, and set them apart from the movies that just want too much. It's not necessarily the themes or the visual style, nor is it the script. But there is something there. The Illusionist tells a story in a straight-forward way while still letting you think for yourself. I like that.The first notable thing about this movie is the acting. Edward Norton is one of my favorites, not least because his best work is usually quite minimalist. In this movie that is definitely the case. Norton is toned-down and excellent. Jessica Biel on the other hand shows that she is not just a pretty face, she does well. But the real star i found to be Rufus Sewell as the crown prince. I have know before that he's a good actor, but he excels here. His subdued rage and mood-swings are beautiful.The second thing i noticed was the visual style. It has a very nice touch to it. It comes in pale, almost sepia-toned, colors with a very nice 'old film'-style to it. The environments in Vienna are beautiful and the sets are a wonderful recreation of the late 19th century. The quite understated score from Phillip Glass complements the visual style nicely.The third and last thing is the plot. I really liked the way that it's straight-forward and yet... not. Even after the movie stops rolling it's not so easy to say what you just saw. Was it real or was it illusions. Paul Giamattis character ends the movie with a laugh that's almost maniacal, and i know how he felt. Movies are about illusions and perceptions. The people making 'The Illusionist' understands this. In a time when audiences are constantly underestimated, and points are driven in with a sledgehammer more often than not, a movie that leaves you thinking is worth a lot, even if the plot itself is not advanced nor exceptional.This is hardly set to become a classic, or most peoples favorite pick for movie of the year. It's not that kind of movie. However it is proof that you can raise the bar with very small means, and make a solid movie just be respecting the audience. Very recommended. I rate this 7/10.",7,1,1,21 May 2007
Transformers," Mindless entertainment
","I'm always a bit on the defensive when it comes to making movies about things i remember from my childhood. Mostly i guess because my memories are probably not that accurate, and in the case of 'Transformers' i was also mostly interested in the toys and not so much the comics. What made me watch this was mostly the fact that a lot of things were actually changed from the 'old' Transformers. Especially the look was completely different, and i guess more adapted to live action as opposed to the cartoon-look.And what did i think? Well, after watching this movie i was happy i did. I have always been a bit of a sucker when it comes to really nice-looking movies, and this is definitely one of those. It's no surprise though since it's Bruckheimer behind the wheel. He might be about as subtle as an earthquake, but he does deliver the goods when it comes to high-octane action. And it doesn't get much more high-octane than huge robots fighting it out in the middle of a city. Also Bruckheimer has started to get his stuff together now. Previously i thought he was probably the worst budget-waster in Hollywood. And i guess in a way it's true, but he still seems to get a lot more out of his money today than a few years ago. The 150 million dollars they sunk into 'Tranformers' gave them what is arguably the best special effects i have ever seen in a movie. And as far as blowing money goes, that is a decent deal.And what about the rest of the movie? Well, i guess that is where you might object. Aside from the effects there isn't much of a movie left. There is a little love story here which is cute in a '80's high-school-movie'-way, but other than that it's mostly just action all the way. And lousy comedy. That was my main complaint with this movie actually, the lousy comedy. There is in particular one scene that shames the whole movie. It's the lowest form of silly comedy with huge robots reduced to clowns. A real mood-breaker to say the least. Also one of the robots has clear Jar-Jar Binks-tendencies with silly noises and moves.In the end though this movie is all about the robots, huge ones. They fight, they transform and they talk and scream with deep voices. There are a few truly huge scenes here, not least the battle scenes in the desert in the beginning of the movie. I would have liked more time with Starscream and a deeper story, perhaps based more on the comic. But in the end this is a huge blockbuster the way one of those are supposed to be. And as long as you don't think too hard about it, it's mindless entertainment at one of it's best.7/10.",7,2,5,17 October 2007
Garden State," Good
","It took me a while, but finally i got round to watching this movie. The DVD had been waiting on my shelf for quite some time and i'm not sure why it took me such a long time to actually put it in the DVD-player. I guess the fact that several people i've spoken to call it one of their favorite movies. That always raises my expectations, which is a dangerous thing. But the danger of disappointment can't keep me away forever.Zach Braff is far from one of my favorite actors. I do enjoy 'Scrubs' somewhat, but mostly because of John C. McGinley. And mentioning 'Scrubs' i think that's the only place i've ever seen Zach Braff before. Or well, i might have seen him in other movies too but not so much that i would remember him. And that in itself says quite a lot.While i find Braffs performance in 'Scrubs' to be quite mediocre, he's a lot better in 'Garden State'. His almost childish looks and rather shy and meek delivery fits perfectly here. He's the man who left his hometown as a boy, who's had psychological (real or imagined) problems ever since he was a child, and who now gets the chance to make peace with his past. His cautious personality is easily explained by a life spent on mind-altering drugs. The cast surrounding Braff is solid though not spectacular. Sarsgaard and Portman perform well. The one that steals the show though is Ian Holm who dominates every scene that he's in, although those are few and quite far between.The story itself in 'Garden State' is not spectacular either. I guess that's part of the movies charm. It's a rather unpretentious drama with quite a lot of humor thrown in. The thing that i found most disturbing (and that lowered the grade by one point) is the ending. Someone wrote that it feels like the movie takes a different turn at the end, like the ending and the movie don't fit together properly. That's a good description because that was my feeling as well. Somehow the movie leaves the unpretentious past and tries to be some sort of 'large-than-life'-drama in the last ten minutes. It doesn't go down well. Since it was entertaining until then i'm going to let it pass, but the ending was nevertheless a disappointment.I rate this 7/10.",7,0,1,2 May 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," At least not as bad as the first...
","I didn't have very high hopes for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I thought the first Resident Evil was a typical Paul W.S. Anderson outing. Meaning an action film making a lot of noise and really trying to be cool and heart-pumping, and failing in every respect. The first movie was in my opinion slow, rather boring and with special effects that needed a lot of work.I don't know if it's because Paul W.S. Anderson has given the directing job to someone else this time around (he was too busy destroying the promising 'Alien Vs. Predator) but something has at least changed for the better here. The action scenes actually seem to have a pulse! We are still quite a distance from what i would call 'blood-pumping', but we're closer than in the first movie. The story here should be pretty easy to guess for anyone who saw the first movie. The first Resident Evil ends with Alice (Milla Jovovich) standing in what's left of Raccoon City. And basically this is the plot, the virus is loose in the city. To make things worse another Umbrella creation, the Nemesis, is also loose in the city and looking for Alice. Oh well, the story seems to be more or less besides the point here.So, what's good and what sucks? Well, as i said the action scenes do have a bit more punch in them than in the first movie. Also they are longer and seem to be made with a larger budget. The setting is also a bit more interesting this time, an abandoned city is almost always a good place to set an action movie. So what sucks? Well, Milla Jovovich is still one of the worst actresses ever to star in a major Hollywood outing. Also, and more importantly, i'm still looking for that sensitivity from the director. That little special gift that makes the action scenes leave you breathless. You know, that thing James Cameron has?Anyway i guess for popcorn-entertainment a Friday night this is not too bad. But don't expect to remember it more than a few minutes. I rate it 5/10 for effort.",Null,0,3,31 October 2004
Saw II," Worthy follow-up
","How do you follow up on a shocking success? Or should i say a successful shocker? Any which way, much of the allure of the first SAW-movie was it's rather original take on the splatter/serial-killer genre. And original movies seldom lend themselves to good sequels. So does this suck? No, actually it doesn't.The film-makers decided to open this movie up a bit more. So there are fewer scenes from a confined space, more characters in the mix and more of a story to follow. That was a good choice, seeing another movie basically following people trapped in a room would have been tedious. It worked great in the first movie but we've seen it once and that's enough. Here instead it plays out as a mix between the first movie and a regular race-against-time thriller.The biggest problem as i see it is the legacy from the first movie, which is of course a classic Achilles-heel for sequels. Here they have tried to remedy that by twisting the story one step further. Making the traps and tests more disgusting, the deaths more gruesome (and plentiful) and of course the characters more deranged. In a way it does work, this movie kept me on my toes for the duration. I didn't really feel there was a need for all that extra blood though, although some of the more disgusting traps were delightfully sick.In the end this attempt at a follow-up works pretty well. It's not that far behind the original movie in entertainment-value. Sure, much of the originality that made the first movie great is gone. But instead they have tried to give some background to the characters and events, some additional story to the script and more interesting and plentiful characters. Also they manage to include a twist-ending that's not quite on par with the first movie, but still nice.I rate this 6/10.",6,0,1,10 July 2007
From Dusk Till Dawn," Two in one
","This movie can be seen in two ways i guess. The first way is to see it and not think, in which case you can just look at it as an entertaining vampire-flick. The other way to look at it is to think a little and realize that this is really two movies in one.The movie starts out quite slow and somber. Two brothers are on the run from the law, having broken out of prison and leaving a trail of dead police officers behind them. They are heading toward the Mexican border at top speed. Their paths cross with a family consisting of a father and his two children. Thinking that it would be easier to cross the border in a motor home with a family the brothers take them hostage.For about half the movie this is not so different from what you would expect from Tarantino. Some quite funny dialog, George Clooney as the foul-mouthed hard-case. And Harvey Keitel as the world-weary preacher being taken hostage. Then the other half of the movie changes style completely. From a rather comfy thriller of sorts it erupts into a splatter-filled vampire-flick. And i guess this is where many people start having trouble with this movie.However, i must confess i really like this movie. In forging these two styles together Robert Rodriguez shows that he has the fingertip-feel needed to balance them out. While there is certainly a lot of gore the comedy never leaves the movie. I found myself sitting with a more or less constant smile on my face throughout. Sometimes, in very rare cases, the sum of the parts are bigger than the whole so to speak. And this is such a case. I rate this 7/10.",7,0,1,27 April 2005
Saw," Despite my tastes, i like it
","I'm no fan of splatter-movies. Rather i don't like them at all with a few notable exceptions. I'm not sure why that is really, i'm not squeamish about blood and i'm not sensitive otherwise either. I guess i just don't see the qualities in a movie where the blood itself is the point.I have seen some people summarily disregard SAW as another splatter-movie. Blood and gore just for the sake of it. Luckily most people don't agree. And indeed there is another quality here. Sick, deranged and quite possibly insane, but also devious and intelligent. There is a method and thought to the killing in this movie. It's not random neither in purpose nor in execution. And that does in fact help when the disgusting scenes become a little too much to watch comfortably.The Jigsaw-killer, as the orchestrator of the games in SAW are called, is one of the more colorful villains in recent years. His insane designs of self-punishment, or rather forced life-defining decisions, are both amazing in appearance as well as devious in function. His single purpose is to make people appreciate life more after having fought a bit for it. While i find that idea disgusting in itself, it is a very alluring concept for a movie.The acting is pretty good, the sets are amazing, the props equally so and the story original. There is blood here, but i think it's still less than what you would be made to believe. Also the sequels live up to the gory expectations more as you would imagine. Here though we have a quite perfect mix between blood and suspense. That being said, i don't think this is for everyone considering that some people would probably just spend the entire running-time behind a pillow.SAW is suspenseful, disgusting and smart - all in the same package. And despite myself and my tastes, i find myself quite liking it. So if you haven't seen it, you should. I rate this 7/10.",7,0,1,10 July 2007
From Hell," Neither good nor bad
","The movies i find most difficult to write a review about are the ones that are neither good nor bad but rather somewhere in between. This is definitely one of those movies.I saw 'From Hell' in the theater back when it was released. And i left the screening not really knowing what to think. While there are a lot of things to like about the movie, it still didn't give me a lasting impression and the story quickly faded from my memory. What i definitely liked was Johnny Depp's doped out investigator, i also liked the very beautiful sceneries and the fact that several of the surrounding actors were very good. No, the problem was neither in the production nor in the acting department. Nor was it due to a boring subject-matter, there is definitely something that's still enticing and curious about Jack the Ripper.So what was it? Well, i don't know really but my best guess is the script. Because despite all this scenery, these good actors and this interesting real-life story, the end-result is actually rather dull and uninteresting. The movie didn't leave a mark, didn't make me want to learn more about Jack the Ripper, and worst of all it didn't really entertain me much. There was simply no nerve, no excitement, present. And for a thriller that's not good.So i guess the grade is... difficult to give. While it was decently entertaining during it's running time, and there was much nice scenery and images to watch, it faded immediately after the movie ended. And of the exciting chase for Jack the Ripper not much excitement remained (or was ever present). So i guess this is somewhere between good and bad, which means... a 5/10?",5,2,4,8 January 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Long-winding
","I could start out by stating the obvious here, that the movie wasn't as good as the book. But that would imply that i found the book to be good, which i didn't really. Don't get me wrong, it was OK and i didn't fall asleep reading it nearly as often as i fell asleep watching this movie.The thing with 'The Da Vinci Code' is that the story isn't that interesting to me. Maybe it's because i've never been a religious person, never been in a family that goes regularly to church and all that. But the subject of the virgin Mary and the Holy Grail is just not that mind-boggling to me. For people who have more of a personal relationship with the Christian mythology it must be something else completely. The book was a pretty smart spin on the whole story though, i have to admit that although i'm no fan of Dan Brown's writing style.This, however, is a review of a movie so let's get down to business. There are three major faults in this movie in my opinion. The one you notice first is Tom Hanks. He's just not good as the Robert Langdon i remembered from the book. Hanks is all wrong and everybody seems to realize it except himself. I admire Tom Hanks for his ability to be at least decent in almost every movie he does, but here it's just wrong. He's not bad, but it would have been so much better with someone else. The second thing is that the whole point of the book, the riddles and mysteries, is almost wasted here. Sure we get some special effects showing us how Langdon sees patterns and deciphers code in his head, but it's never exciting nor intelligent like it was (at least occasionally) in the book. Third and last is the length and pace of the movie. It's far too long-winded with endless scenes and a very slow pace that isn't very inspiring. Since the riddles didn't work very well one could have thought that they would go for the more fast-paced thriller style (which could have worked well with the content in my opinion). Instead it's a slow and methodical iteration of almost every scene in the book. And it's not exciting at all.It's always hard to film a literary success like 'The Da Vinci Code'. People have read the book, liked it, and their expectations are astronomical. These expectations are made to disappoint, and i guess most people didn't really like this movie either (even though they might cut it some slack because at least it looks nice). My expectations on the other hand were quite mellow and i was still somewhat disappointed. Sure, Ron Howard is perhaps the most boring director of his generation, and sure Tom Hanks is not someone who lifts a production all by himself. But still, there was enough cinematic style and content in the book to make a very decent movie. But i can't call this anything other than a failure. And not only that, it's a boring and very long-winding failure, which is even worse.I rate it 4/10.",4,0,2,4 December 2006
Titanic," Better than expected
","I don't consider romantic drama to be my genre exactly. And since Leonardo DiCaprio was a notorious pretty boy (cast mostly to satisfy teenage girls) expectations were exceptionally low. But i was actually pleasantly surprised.The story revolves around the poor and artistic Jack and the rich girl Rose. They meet by chance on the Titanic and fall in love. First their love has to stand the test of class difference, then the test of the ship sinking...When i say i was pleasantly surprised that of course has to be weighed against the fact that expectations were exceptionally low. But still this is actually a lot more entertaining than i could ever have dreamed it would be. Most of the credit for that i would have to give James Cameron who seldom disappoints. But while this movie does entertain (not least because of very impressive visuals) it's still a very simple and basic story. I guess what it comes down to is expectations. If you expect it to be movie of the century, a deep and sensitive film, you will be sorely disappointed. It is well-made, decently acted, beautifully shot and rather entertaining. As long as you remember what kind of movie you are watching. I rate it 6/10.",6,1,4,18 January 2005
Mystic River," Second time around
","I must admit that when i watched this movie for the first time i didn't really think that much of it. Sure the acting was amazing, but that was expected. But then something happened. I got a chance to read the book by Dennis Lehane and suddenly all the pieces fell into place. I watched the movie again and this time it was amazing.I don't know how i should interpret how my feelings toward this movie changed after reading the book. Is it a good adaptation if i like it more after reading the book? Should a movie stand so well on it's own merits that the book is not necessary? I don't know myself, all i know is that it all became so much clearer after reading the book.First of all the acting was amazing even the first time around. But still, after reading the book it was as if the characters gained one more level of depth. I have always felt that Tim Robbins is the true gem in this movie. His pained portrayal of the lost soul Dave Boyle is pure magic, seldom has an Oscar been so well deserved. Sean Penn is predictably great in his portrayal of Jimmy Markum. It's a difficult character, a person you really don't know what to think about. In one respect he is a worried father, in another respect he is a cold-blooded man with few things to like about him. The rest of the cast is solid, with Kevin Bacon the brightest star among them.When it comes to the plot itself this was where much was changed from reading the book. The trick is not to watch this as a crime-drama. Rather it's a movie about behavioral patterns, about humans. What they are capable of and what dictates their actions. There are huge amounts of sadness and melancholy to this story. Of people unable to break out of the path it seems life has chosen for them. This i think didn't really break through to me that well when i watched the movie for the first time. But the book is much more clear on this and when i watched the movie again i saw it there as well.In the end this is a triumph of two things really. First the great acting of some of the finest actors in Hollywood today, second the sensitive and thoughtful directing of Clint Eastwood. He manages to bring out Dennis Lehanes story in a way that is so understated and minimalistic at times i didn't even catch on the first time around. But if i look closely all the elements are there and it is truly a great adaptation as well as a great movie.",8,146,180,8 November 2005
The Departed," Great!
","Scorsese is one of my favorite directors, at least he has certainly made a few of my favorite movies. And seeing how he keeps the quality of his work so constantly high is astonishing. And not only that, i would rate this as his finest movie this decade. While i did enjoy 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator' (both are fine movies in my opinion) this is still a lot closer to the masterpieces of Scorseses previous career.I have always considered the American way of taking foreign movies and making a new version rather silly. I don't know whether they do it because they can't stand reading subtitles or if there are other reasons. Generally the new versions are also inferior which makes it an even less understandable practice. Here though we have the opposite. While i feel that 'Infernal Affairs' is certainly an interesting movie, and a quality film to boot, i still feel that 'The Departed' is a vast improvement.What i was perhaps most impressed by when i watched this movie was the way that Scorsese brought the best out of the entire ensemble. Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg are far from my favorite actors but they are all as good as i have seen them here. Damon usually has something stiff and almost detached about him that i don't like, but here he seems a lot more relaxed and really flows into his character. Jack Nicholson on the other hand is one of my favorites, and he is absolutely magnificent in 'The Departed'. He makes one of those appearances where he just dominates every scene that he's in, and unlike many other great actors who have been in the game for a long time, he never seems to relax and turn on the autopilot.Of course in a thriller the story has to be interesting too, a great ensemble is not enough. And i think that 'The Departed' delivers there as well. While it is perhaps maybe 20 minutes longer than i would have liked, it never becomes painfully so. A few twists along the way are also bound to keep most people guessing.After watching 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator' i felt afraid that Scorsese might never reach the peaks of his earlier career, and therefore would never receive the Oscar that should have been his a long time ago. But 'The Departed' gives me hope since this is yet another memorable and simply great movie. Very recommended! 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2007
Die Hard," One of the best
","'Die Hard' is one of those numerous action movies from the 1980's with one strong hero and caricature-evil bad guys. And of course the obligatory outrageous body-count. It's also one of my favorites of the period.I read somewhere that Arnold Schwarzenegger was first offered the role of John McClane but declined. Which is a stroke of luck to say the least. This is the movie that launched Bruce Willis action-movie stardom and he is one of the definite high-points in this movie. It also helps that he looks more normal than the beefed-up Arnold, lending at least a little more credibility to his character. The second high-point is of course the always excellent Alan Rickman as the German bad guy with the British accent. He has got to be one of the most memorable movie-villains ever. The third and final piece of the puzzle is the action-scenes. This movie has some of the best action-scenes produced in the 1980's to say the least. Many 80's movies were mostly about some huge body-builder standing still mowing people down. This on the other hand is a lot more refined. Willis is the kind of character that actually bleeds and hurts and feels vulnerable. And actually has to get out of the way when the bad-guys fire back...The story of a team of international criminals wanting to steal 640 million dollars in bonds is not the most original story ever. But the claustrophobic 'nowhere-to-run' theme of the movie set a new industry-standard and felt genuinely new. The fact that it's also exceptional in the action department and has actors to match makes it one of the most intensely enjoyable action movies to date. Recommended! 8/10",8,1,3,1 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Solid entertainment
","Stephen Spielberg is a legendary director, no question about that. While i don't see him as the one making the most enjoyable movies in the world there is a certain quality to his work that usually makes it worth at least the two hours you spend watching it. 'War of the worlds' is no exception.Lately it feels like overblown special effects and huge scenes of destruction have been showing up in almost every movie. What was previously something almost unreal and astounding to watch has become commonplace and nothing at all spectacular. When stepping into the movie theater today, watching a big-budget movie, you know that the effects will be good. It's simply not that hard anymore to make it look very nice. So a movie relying more or less exclusively on it's effects is not very likely to appeal to me. 'War of the worlds' is more or less a movie like that, but still i found it quite enjoyable.First of all Tom Cruise is not a bad actor. He's not worth the insane wages he pulls in but he hardly ever gives a bad performance. Here he's as solid as Spielbergs directing. Dakota Fanning is suitably annoying as his odd and twitchy daughter, Justin Chatwin rather lame as his 'rebellious' son. The effects are, as can be expected, very good. Rating among the better i've seen as a matter of fact. Adding quite considerably to the enjoyment of the film. Also i like the way that the film-makers kept the look of the original 1950's movie. A nice touch.So, what's the verdict? Well it's not a bad movie, actually it exceeded my expectations (that were not very high i willingly admit). It's entertaining enough while it lasts. In the end though it's just too bland to really stay with you. The day after i watched it i remember being asked if it was any good and even that close to watching it i could hardly remember it. So it's not likely to ever become a classic or a movie that i would like to own. But it's good entertainment for the moment, saved mostly by it's fast pace and solid directing from Spielberg. I rate it 6/10.",6,0,2,4 September 2005
Love Actually," One of the best of it's kind
","Sometimes it's not easy to put your finger on why you feel the way you do, but the fact that you feel it is undisputed. The fact that i almost always like British comedy is one of those facts. I can't always say why but it more or less never fails.Light British romantic comedy is a genre that seems to have grown considerably these last few years. Add Hugh Grant and you have a winning formula. And why not? Even though movies like 'Love Actually' are often quite corny and never really surprising they are nevertheless enjoyable. Mostly because of two things really. First of all the comedy is very British, meaning that it's usually quite subtle and often a little peculiar. Second there is almost always great actors involved. Here we have a big part of the British acting elite. Aforementioned Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman... The one that stands out most in this movie though is without a doubt Bill Nighy as the washed-up rock singer who gets one last chance with a Christmas song.This is very much a Christmas movie. Not only because it's set at Christmas but also because it's warm, funny and very cozy. And i say that in the best sense of the words, not in the vomit-inducing way that sugar-sweet TV-movies are cozy. It does have problems. Some of the episodes are less necessary really and it does get overly long before the end. But still it's one of the best of it's kind, and i have to admit i play 'Christmas all around' every Christmas since...7/10.",7,0,2,1 January 2006
30 Days of Night," A good idea wasted
","I don't even know why i watch vampire-movies any more. The genre has become a marsh-land of mediocrity. But i guess i liked the premise of this movie. Living in the north myself i can relate to long and dark winters, and how this would actually benefit the vampire (if he or she can stand the cold that comes with it).My main problem with this movie is undoubtedly the fact that they wasted the whole premise completely. First of all they have no idea how winters in the north work. Here it's: one day there is regular sunlight, daylight for hours. The Next day it's complete blackness that goes on for thirty days. Doesn't that strike people as odd. They would have had almost no sunlight at all for a long time before it turns into complete darkness. Well, whatever. That's a minor point, even if it does make the plot a lot more nonsensical.A larger part of the problem is that they haven't done anything fun with the darkness. There is no skulking vampires, no regular town getting picked off one by one while life tries to go on. Rather this is a sudden slaughter and then humans skulking around. Without revealing too much i have to say that i would have preferred the other way around. After all the vampires come there to have a steady food supply over the winter while being able to walk around 24 hours a day. Basically that's not what happens.So, i liked the premise but not the execution. What of the other qualities of the movie? Special effects? Actors. Well, the effects are decent enough for the most part although it's nothing you haven't seen about a million times already. Vampires are pale with bad teeth, walking around wheezing and growling for no reason. The heroes are Mr goody two-shoes (Josh Hartnett) and a motley crew of not too interesting townsfolk. And of course there is the always-present ex-wife/girlfriend with a pretty face.Honestly, this movie bored me. There is a lot more finesse required for the vampire genre to do it for me. And if not finesse then maybe a sense of humor or good action scenes. What we have here is basically a long wait for something to happen. And when it finally does, it's less than exciting. I actually found myself preferring the Blade-movies to this one. At least there something happens and the vampires are menacing in an entertaining way. This is mostly just a good idea completely wasted. I rate this 3/10.",3,1,6,29 July 2008
Man on Fire," I want my two hours back
","Once in a while i see a movie so completely and utterly pointless, so bereft of entertainment value, that i wish i could have the two hours of my life back. It's not often, but it does happen. 'Man on Fire' is one of those movies.The outlook was rather promising. Academy Award-winning Denzel Washington in the lead, a plot that sounded at least as promising as most of the things coming out of Hollywood and decent director Tony Scott at the helm. Despite all these things the movie falls completely flat. And for this there are several reasons.Denzel Washington is a great actor in my opinion. He's not that bad in 'Man on Fire' either. I would say he does his best. Acting is in fact not one of the major problems of this movie at all. Rather the complete lack of emotion is what disturbs me. The first half of the movie is a jaded Denzel working as a bodyguard for a little girl (Dakota Fanning). Her parents hired him to protect her from kidnapping, which apparently is a common thing in Mexico. The little girl is kidnapped and Denzel seriously wounded. The rest of the movie is Denzel exacting vengeance on the kidnappers in the most sadistic ways he can think of. Completely without emotion the movie shows Denzel performing one disgusting act after another, with the obvious logic that his violence is justified. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to say the least.Apart from the violence then? Well this movie feels in style like watching a two-hour episode of 'CSI: Miami'. The camera constantly zooms in, zooms out, light flashes, focus on, focus off, zoom in, flash, grain, flash. Incredibly annoying to say the least. There was obviously a rather substantial budget behind this movie, yet they completely fail to make it visually appealing or interesting.To summarize this movie it's a classic tale of vengeance. Movies like this one have been made for a very long time with varying results. Generally i find the genre quite uninteresting, and this is a prime example of that. Seldom have i seen a movie so cold and without emotion, which is of course a bad thing considering we are meant to feel just how justified the protagonist's actions are. The end result is just one blood-filled orgy of violence filmed in a twitchy and annoying way. I want my two hours back.I rate this 2/10 (2 instead of 1 only because of Denzel)",2,5,14,17 May 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Visually stunning
","Vampire movies seem to be one of the most popular genres in film, both past and present. I'm no huge fan of the genre, but this is an interesting movie well worth the attention.The solicitor Renfield is sent to far-away Transylvania to negotiate a purchase of an estate in London. The buyer is the mysterious count Dracula. Soon though it dawns on Renfield that the count is a vampire who plans on stealing his fiancé and having his way with the people of London.The book 'Dracula' by Bram Stoker is an interesting book i think. It's not what i would call brilliant in any way. But still the way it's told, in letters between the main characters and entries into their diaries, is interesting. This movie is one of the few i have seen that at least tries a little to follow this concept and does it successfully. I won't elaborate much on the story since it is well known to most people.More than anything this movie is a feast for the eyes and ears. The cinematography and camera-work is outstanding. The effects are also very very good and the music is a masterpiece from composer Wojciech Kilar. Gary Oldman is magnificent as count Dracula and further heightens the experience. The rest of the cast are also mostly well cast. Unfortunately one of the things that really disturbs me is Keanu Reeves portraying the important character Renfield. I can't understand why they would choose to use Keanu Reeves with a thick obviously fake accent when there are so many good British actors around. When will film-makers realize that the audience DO appreciate a good actor rather than a big name on the poster?!The focus in this film is on the love story. Something that contributes to the fact that you many times feel sympathetic towards the vampire. And it also lends a warmth to the story that many other similar films lack. Still this remains a faithful rendition of the book, well adapted for the big screen. Well made, mostly well acted and beautiful like few other movies. I would rate this experience 7/10.",7,0,1,16 January 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Decent rental
","'Anchorman' is one of those movies that i have a hard time with. I don't know what to think really. While i did get some laughs out of it, it still left me wondering what it was i just saw. It's like a joke with no clear punchline, it might be funny but you still wonder what the big point was.This movie rests heavily on the shoulders of Will Ferrell. He's in almost every scene in the movie and i think he carries it quite well. Ferrell is one of those comedy actors that has the ability to be at least somewhat funny even when the material is not. Many Saturday Night Live-skits were saved by him in my opinion. Here he is the centerpiece but he also has good help from the standard supporting actors for movies like this one, people like Vince Vaughn and Steve Carell. Aside from Will Ferrell most responsibility lies on Christina Applegate. She has comic timing enough but her character is quite poorly written which doesn't really allow her to deliver.'Anchorman' is a movie that is sometimes very funny but most of the time not spectacularly so. Rather i was sitting there watching, often with a smile and an occasional laugh. It's not boring but it's not great. It's the most funny when well-known actors show up in cameos. Not only do they add some surprise to the mix but those scenes also feel more well-written than most. 'Anchorman' is not an intelligent movie but it doesn't offend your intelligence either like so many other movies with this set-up and actors. Recommended as a decent rental.5/10.",5,2,3,15 November 2005
Kingpin," The golden age of the Farrelly-brothers
","I liked the Farrelly brothers for a while. If it was something they knew it was how to make comedy that was sometimes downright nasty, but still with so much heart and love for their characters. Lately they've lost that touch (as well as almost all the other qualities they had), but this movie is still one of my favorites from their golden age.Actually i would rate this as their best film along with 'Something About Mary' which says a lot. The story in Kingpin is nothing spectacular, but the actors all seem to enjoy themselves. Randy Quaid is awesome as the unwilling bowling Amish, Woody Harrelson great as his con-man manager and finally Bill Murray is as usual brilliant as the antagonist. Just like most of the work from the Farrelly-brothers this movie constantly uses cheap tricks and nasty comedy to get laughs from the audience. Often below the belt, often mean, but always with a tongue-in-cheek that makes it work.When it comes to the combination bowling and comedy, this is number one next to 'The Big Lebowski'. Silly, sure, but also very very funny. And seeing this movie today almost brings a tear to my eye when i think about the huge and disastrous failures that are 'Stuck On You' and 'Shallow Hal'. I rate this 7/10.",7,2,5,21 September 2005
Kong: Skull Island," Best monster movie I've seen in a long time
","Monster movies are a genre of their own, and common rules don't apply. Plots need to follow certain formulas and the drama is always somewhat predictable. I haven't always been a fan of the genre, not least because there are a lot of big-budget stinkers in the past. This is not one of them.First of all, breaking the standard plot for a King Kong-movie helps. Another straight remake like the one from Peter Jackson would have been unbearable. Adding a lot of well-known and well-performing actors also help. Of course the movie is packed with special effects, and yet I'm not really bothered by them the way that I often am. Not that they are very life-like or believable, but they are done with a certain flair. Also, the ape itself is just the right amount of human.When it comes to popcorn-movies, this is the real deal. Running a very reasonable two hours (instead of the insane three hours these movies tend to run), I was never bored. Good entertainment.",7,1,1,5 August 2017
Ray," Mixed feelings
","That 'Ray' would lead to mixed feelings was something that i had gathered from reviews as well as comments from other viewers. And i think the term 'mixed feelings' sums this movie up pretty well indeed.Let's start with the acting. Jamie Foxx received an Oscar for his portrayal of Ray Charles. After seeing the movie i must say that the Oscar felt justified. Foxx performs very well and is very believable as well as emotional in his part. Well-deserved. The rest of the cast perform rather well too, especially Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. So far so good. So what about the portrayal of Ray? I would have to say it's surprisingly candid. Often when movies are made about legends like Ray Charles they don't turn into biographies as much as idolization. Here the film-makers avoid that. They spend a lot of time showing that Ray Charles was not only a musical genius but also a heroin-addict and a womanizer. The fact that they didn't only show the rosy parts added to the experience.I spoke in the beginning about mixed feelings. So far i've only really told you about what i appreciated. Well, there are also problems in this movie. Especially when it comes to pace and story. It feels sometimes like the movie is moving on very fast while still managing to be slow. Especially the first half is quite a test of one's stamina. But the slow pace was not what i found most annoying. Rather it was the constant and rather misplaced use of flashbacks all through the movie. Flashbacks is a thing usually left to B-movies and in my opinion that's where it should stay. Here flashbacks are used as a way of showing Ray's torment with some of his childhood experiences, but it's just too much. Many of the flashbacks are a little over the top as well.So a mixed feeling it is. The film-makers manage to get what feels like both sides of the person Ray Charles, they also manage to find the perfect actor for the job. However they mistreat the story and tell it in a way that makes it unnecessarily slow. And somewhere along the line it seems they realized that it was going to be slow, so they added a couple of dramatic flashbacks here and there. In the end though this is a decent biography of a brilliant musician. And the movie does contain a lot of great music as well. I rate it 6/10.",6,0,3,12 September 2005
Shooter," Fuquas best
","I wasn't exactly expecting a miracle when i sat down to watch this movie on DVD. Antoine Fuqua had never made an enjoyable movie before this one, and Mark Wahlberg with his mumbling acting is not one of my favorites. Although, i have to admit that Wahlberg has gotten his act together lately. Expectations where nevertheless not very high.The story here is easy to recognize, you've probably seen it many times before. One man is betrayed by his government, but is lured back by his sense of duty and patriotism, just to have someone screw him over once again. In this case it's the sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) who is disillusioned when his spotter is killed in some African country (or some such). Now the government wants his help to flush out a sniper who wants to kill the president.The problem with a movie like this one in the suspension of disbelief. While many movies try to pass themselves off as fairly realistic they still demand that you turn off parts of your brain. This is one such movie. Wahlberg with his hillbilly name constantly faces off against hordes of people who are easily as 'elite' as he is. There are all manners of special forces people trying to kill him and he mows them down by the dozens. And not only with sniper-rifles either...That being said, i still enjoyed this movie in general. The action scenes are pretty well made, the story itself is not very original but it works. Also the actors are pretty good, with especially Danny Glover in good shape. And in general i'm willing to forgive action movies for a lot of the inconsistencies that comes with the package, as long as they are entertaining. So just turn of the part of your brain that says one-man-armies doesn't exist, and you'll be able to enjoy this movie. It is without a doubt Fuquas finest to date.I rate it 6/10.",6,1,4,26 September 2007
Lord of War," One thought
","One thought went through my mind as the overblown starting credits to this movie rolled over the screen: MTV. Without MTV we wouldn't have movies like this one. I remember seeing a sort of AIDS-themed weekend on MTV once, and this movie is like that weekend only here we are dealing with guns. So if MTV ever chose to do an 'MTV: Gun Weekend' it would be something like this movie.Nicholas Cage (looking more or less constantly bored) is the hotshot arms dealer in this movie. A Ukrainian American starting out with small deals on UZI:s and ending up selling half the Ukrainian Soviet arsenal to third world countries at war. And all the while, not a single emotion shown in any of the characters. Except perhaps from the perpetually depressed dope-head brother of Cage, played by Jared Leto.I don't demand much from movies like this one. Sure a pop-culture styled drama about guns could work. But here we have a movie that also wants to portray a person that should at least be halfway believable and who is supposed to be an amalgam of a bunch of real arms-dealers. And yet, with all those personalities in him we don't get a schizophrenic person, rather we get a cardboard character. A person completely bereft of any humanity. He just walks through life doing things like a machine, never saying 'why'. He doesn't seem to enjoy his work, his wife or his money. So what is his motivation? Apparently nothing.Beside the shallowness of the character this movie is a true believer in the thesis 'style over substance'. It seems more like an experiment in style and special effects than a real movie with a real message. Message? Well, when you make a drama like this one asking so many questions about guns and the morality of selling them one could actually expect a message. I would have settled for something like 'decide for yourself whether the arms-dealer is evil', but we don't even get that. This is a waste of time.",3,6,13,27 February 2006
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Above par
","The Korean War is somewhat overlooked in cinema i think. I guess it's because it happened between two big and traumatic American wars, WW2 and Vietnam. Seeing a movie made from a Korean perspective is not surprisingly also more interesting than it would be to see an American movie of the same thing. Having said that, the differences between this movie and a Hollywood-production are few except the language.Korean movies have come closer and closer to western movies both in quality and design. This is a very well-made war movie with high production values and good special effects. The story is pretty straight-forward with two brothers being drafter into the army at the same time. One of the brothers try to gain commendations so he can have the other one sent home to continue his university studies. But somewhere along the way he loses his perspective and forgets why he's fighting.The refreshing (and surprising) thing here is the way that South Koreans are not pictured as saints. Usually in modern war movies it's common to try and humanize the enemy, but considering that the conflict between North and South Korea is still ongoing (albeit in a 'cold' form) i didn't really know what to expect. But this is fairly balanced, although of course told from a South Korean perspective.The acting is fairly good here, with several faces you recognize from other recent Korean movies. The story is fairly coherent and aside from a few scenes i found impossible to understand this was a straightforward affair. That's one of the larger complaints that i've always had with Asian movies, the fact that the story is often not very coherent. Also the characters often feel illogical in their actions and motivations. But in this movie, they avoid this problem more or less completely.In the end this is a rather straight-forward war movie that's very similar to most western equivalents from later years. In that regard it might not be revolutionary, but it is well made. Character development and story arc are above par for Asian movies, and in general the movie looks expensive and well done. It's entertaining while it lasts. I rate it 7/10.",7,1,2,6 August 2007
The Good Shepherd," Worth the trouble, despite pacing problems
","I had 'The Good Shepherd' lying in my 'to see'-pile for quite a long time before i finally popped it in the DVD-player. I always find it somewhat daunting to see movies that are almost three hours long.This has to be one of the most toned-down movies i have seen in quite a long time. Actually this movie and Zodiac makes me think that the toned-down movie might have sort of a revival now. Most movies made are still full of bells and whistles, the pace is high and the special effects are plentiful. Seeing movies that take more time to tell the story is refreshing, although i didn't think neither this movie nor Zodiac managed to balance the pace perfectly. Both of them become somewhat slow at times, and while i did enjoy both movies, they would have benefited from a more to-the-point story and narrative.I can start by saying what i did like about this movie. First of all i think this might be one of Matt Damons best roles. I'm not a huge fan of Damon in general. He's a pretty good actor, but very stiff and lacks the edge that would make him great. Here his stiffness works for him and becomes one of the characters main features. It works great. Second i liked the whole story and layout of the movie. The spy business is interesting and this is a very down-to-earth look at it, and probably closer to the truth than most movies. Third i liked that it was about the person more than anything. How much can a man sacrifice for his job and his country? All choices and acts have consequences, and they can be very unforgiving.What didn't i like? Well, i have mentioned the pacing problem. It's quite substantial through parts of the movie. Not only is the story moving forward very slowly, it also has the habit of moving back and forth in time for a while in a way that doesn't exactly clarify things. A more straight narrative that was a bit more quick on it's feet would have been preferable. Also the running time of 2 hours and 40 minutes is a bit heavy. Even though i was never really bored with the movie, i still think that in general most movies benefit from trimming some of the fat. This movie is no exception.In the end i found this movie to be enjoyable. It shows that Mr DeNiro is a competent director, able to tell a story in a sombre pace without boring the audience. The movie does have pacing problems, but in the end those problems are far outweighed by the positive features. Matt Damon is excellent in the lead, most supporting actors are great and the movie looks gorgeous. I would recommend it, although you need to know what to expect (a long movie moving at a slow pace) and take your time with it. I rate this 7/10.",7,1,2,18 February 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Friendship
","Still ranked #2 on IMDb:s top 250-list, this is not one of those epic masterpieces like resident #1 'The Godfather'. Rather this is a small and quite low-key film that brings up some of the biggest concepts in life. And that it certainly speaks to people can be seen from the grade if nothing else.I had watched this movie a few years ago, and i didn't really understand then what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed it, surely, but not in the way that other people seemed to. But having recently watched it again i must say that the message finally drove home. For several reasons this is an amazing film.First of all the concepts it touches. Justice, fairness, endurance, hope and of course above all friendship. Seldom have i seen a movie so filled with emotion and still it's not weighted down by it. The movie is one of the few i have seen where all this emotion truly feels justified. Not least because of the second reason why this is an amazing movie: the actors. Tim Robbins is one of my personal favorites, an amazing actor to say the least. He almost never fails to deliver and here he is mesmerizing. Morgan Freeman is another stable and dependable actor, but i don't think he has ever been as good as he is here. And they are supported by a very well balanced and well chosen supporting cast. Finally Frank Darabonts directing is done with the lightest touch and an amazing attention to detail. He never lets things slide out of hand as they often do when strong emotions are present.While i find this to be an amazing film the high average score here at IMDb still surprises me somewhat. It's a great movie, but it's not the kind of movie i expected so many people would consider great. But maybe it's just because what we have here is a movie about the greatest thing life has to offer; friendship. And an unlikely friendship at that, simple to understand and simple to appreciate. This is a feel-good movie in the best way imaginable - one where you must first pass through fire before you reach redemption.9/10",9,0,0,26 November 2005
Shrek," Beautiful and funny
","My view on animated film is rather divided i would say. I don't have anything against the media although i find the movies are often not very enjoyable. This has changed a bit with Pixars movies, and of course this one.Shrek is an ogre living in a swamp. Suddenly his wonderfully desolate swamp gets filled with fairy-tale creatures though. It seems that the prince who runs the land has decided to rid it of all fairy-tale creatures. So now they have come to hide in Shreks swamp, disturbing his peace. Shrek goes to the prince to complain, and ends up being sent away on an important mission.The first thing that strikes me about this movie is how wonderfully animated it is. It's simply stunning! The animation technique here seems to be focused more on realism than the one used in Pixars movies. This gives Shrek a more textured look, almost like you could touch the characters with your hand.The second thing that strikes me is the wonderful sense of humor. Seldom has an animated movie been done with such exquisite feeling for what's funny and what's not. Also they have managed to make this extremely enjoying both for adults and children. Pixars movies are good but i always felt they were more directed at children, this however contains enough nods to things an adult understands more than a child, which make it fun for the whole family.In short, i found this movie to be wonderful. The sense of humor, the stylish look, the funny characters, the nods to fairy tales and the world that has been created. All this combined make this one of the most entertaining movies in it's genre. I rate it 8/10.",8,1,3,7 February 2005
Any Given Sunday," Pompous
","Any Given Sunday has to be the most pompous and overblown sports movie ever made. Dripping with emotion and full of slow-motion shots and overly long speeches about the honor in fighting the good fight, winning and losing. Having said that, i found the movie to be entertaining and one of the better sports movies i've seen!The story is pretty straight-forward. The run-down Football-coach D'Amato (Al Pacino) has trouble with just about everything. His wife left him, he has pressure coming from all sides. From the hard-to-control players, from the team owner (a beautiful and sinister Cameron Diaz) and from the relentless media always willing to pick on him. So the question is, can he keep the team together and prove his aging tactics can still win?This movie has Oliver Stone written all over it. The overblown music, the heroic themes and the slow-motion. I would call this porno for Football-fans. It's Oliver Stones salute to the athlete as the modern-day Gladiator, the fighter who never backs down. But then again, it's also a look into a sports world where everything is about money. A sports world where athletes run down the field pumped up with drugs, knowing that the next tackle could cost them their life. Just one more game, just one more until they get the bonus...So, what makes this rise above the (admittedly mediocre) run of sports movies that have come out previously? Well, first of all 'Any Given Sunday' is stylish in a way that few sports movies are. Hell, they even manage to make the Football games look interesting, and the only sport that bores me more than American Football is Baseball! Also, it's quite shameless in it's admiration of the athletes. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. Many people will find this a bit too muscular and testosterone-filled. And admittedly it's not for everyone. But i prefer this to another 'aging-athlete-succeeds'-movie starring Kevin Costner ANY given Sunday (or any other day of the week for that matter). This is grand entertainment, and sometimes that's all you need. I rate it 6/10.",Null,0,1,19 November 2004
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I actually enjoyed this somewhat
","Superman has to be the most boring of all super heroes. Weighed down by the inherent boring quality of a perfect character. All powerful, all good and all wise he just prances around doing the right thing. I don't think any movie has really been able to complicate Superman to any relevant degree. I don't think that this movie does either, but I still found it a lot more entertaining than any of the other Superman- movies featuring Cavill. To be honest, I can't say that I have enjoyed any Superman-movie as much as most other superhero- movies.The whole premise for this movie is of course the fight between Batman and Superman. And does it deliver? Fair enough I would say. Batman has turned into some sort of overladen, Iron Man-like cyborg walking around looking very short and stocky. Of course, if you want to fist-fight Superman you will probably need some Hardware. Action- scenes are generally fairly well-executed. Affleck is surprisingly good as Batman, and Cavill as usual does a good job with Superman (it's not his fault that it's a boring character). Jesse Eisenberg seems to enjoy himself as an erratic Lex Luthor.Aside from a few more or less contrived cameos from the rest of the Super best friends (or Justice League or whatever), heralding more movies, and a bit of a pacing problem at times, this is a good effort. As far as popcorn-movies go, I liked it. Not as much as the latest Captain America, but I think this series has the potential to be a bit more grown-up and raw. At least I hope so.",7,1,5,17 July 2016
Casino Royale," Bond for the 21st century
","Seeing a new Bond-film used to be something that i looked forward to. But as the last few movies starring Brosnan have been so awful (not Brosnans fault though) i approached this one with a lot more caution. Especially since the premise looked so good. The director previously directed 'Goldeneye' which was the only really good Bond-film with Brosnan, Daniel Craig looked like a perfect Bond, initial reports were positive etc. But all the more reason to be cautious in getting my hopes up.Fortunately 'Casino Royale' delivered. I must say i find this to be the best Bond-film in decades. Sure, it's very different from the things we are used to see in Bond-films. There is very little comic relief, very little romance and almost no unbelievably advanced little gadgets. The modern Bond just needs his laptop, his mobile phone and gun to get around. And an Aston Martin of course, some things don't change.So, while this is not a standard James Bond-film, it still feels like it works so much better than the classic formula. Not least because we've seen that formula so many times that it becomes predictable, as well as dated (electronic gizmo's aren't as fun when we can all get them). Daniel Craig plays Bond more the way you would expect the real Bond to be. A man bereft of empathy, a strong and ruthless person. Well trained, with a face carved in stone and a style to match. Pretty far from the more relaxed suave Bond of Pierce Brosnan or Roger Moore. A different Bond for sure, and i don't know which Bond i prefer, rather i would just state that he's different and works very well, and leave it at that.All these changes are bound to turn people away from the movie. And while i consider this to be a great movie, i don't really connect it that much to previous Bond-movies. Rather it's a great movie in and off itself. It has great pacing with quick and energy-packed action scenes, as well as calmer moments of suspense. It's well acted, well written and makes a lot more sense than most Bond-films of late. No madman wanting to take over the world, but instead a more logical and believable foe. While i admit that i feel a bit of sadness at losing the Bond-movies unique touches, this movie really brings the franchise into the 21st century.So i recommend this both to people who are Bond-fans, as well as people who just want a well-acted, well-written and action-filled movie. I rate it 8/10.",8,0,2,6 January 2007
Signs," Roller-coaster
","M. Night Shyamalan seems to be like a train. While he does move on in a steady pace, he doesn't leave the track. Prestenly he has directed four films that are very similar in style, the last of these 'The Village'.Graham Hess is a farmer who suddenly discovers huge crop circles in his corn fields. What do these mean? Signs from above? But from who and why? Graham is about to find out along with the rest of humanity.My summary above was 'roller-coaster'. And why? Because 'Signs' is like a roller-coaster ride? Not really, what i meant was rather that this movie displays an astonishing spectrum of quality. From very good and solid scenes to some elements that are pure garbage. It's very 'up and down' you might say. There are two things that i found very disturbing about this movie. First of all the ending (or rather the resolution), which i won't discuss in detail since it would mean spoilers. But one thing to think about is this: if you were an omnipotent being, how hard would it be for you to force your way through a wooden door?! The second thing is Mel Gibson. I don't know what it is about that man. Sometimes he can be great, and sometimes he degrades his acting talent to the level of Christopher Lambert! His attempts at emotional displays here are pathetic to say the least.With that said this movie has a few strong points that makes it worth watching nevertheless. First of all the almost patented atmosphere of suspense that Shyamalan always manages to create. The effective mood of something bad about to happen. Also the story works pretty well despite some flaws. What i also appreciate is the rather quirky sense of humor that Shyamalan displays in this movie. Some people have interpreted this as the director making fun of his own movie. But rather i see it as his way of not making the movie grave and serious to the point where everything becomes silly.So, i recommend this to fans of Shyamalan and fans of suspenseful thrillers. But i also raise a flag of warning about Mel Gibson. If you didn't like Mel Gibson to begin with, you will loathe him here. I rate it 5/10.",5,2,5,18 January 2005
Beowulf," Mediocre
","I wasn't really that interested in the movie Beowulf, but i when i got a chance to see it on DVD i thought i might as well. And honestly it was a bewildering experience.Robert Zemeckis is in my opinion a fairly competent director, although not the most exciting one. Somehow it seems he's made it his 'thing' to make special-effects heavy movies that even have effects where none are needed. I remember watching the (quite good) 'What Lies Beneath', not realizing that almost every scene had been full of CGI. So it seems that Zemeckis gets a high from CGI (it rhymes!) and of course to each his own... But Beowulf really suffers from this. Maybe it's just me, but i can't see the point of this movie being animated like it is. You take good actors, nice-looking actors, and animate them to look like plastic versions of themselves. The effect is somewhat reminiscent of a slightly more realistic Shrek. Why would they do this? The CGI is so good today that they could just record the movie in front of a green-screen and add whatever they want, why animate the characters? This is my main problem with this movie, especially since the CGI doesn't look very good. The animations are stiff and objects seem to lack weight and substance in a way that was more common in CGI a couple of years ago.I can't say that this movie 'did it' for me aside from the CGI either. The story has been seen many times before and it's not really spectacular any more. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's uninteresting, but it does lack something to make it truly interesting. A definite upside to the movie is the actors. There are many recognizable voices (and faces, although they look plastic-wrapped) and many of them do a fine job with the material. I have always liked Ray Winstone and he doesn't disappoint here either. Most of the supporting cast were good, and Angelina Jolie was awful as usual. I honestly don't see what she has going for her except her looks. She re-uses the Russian accent from 'Alexander' and puts in another pathetic performance. It's impressive to get so far while being so lousy in most of what you do.Anyway, to sum things up i guess this could have been an interesting movie save for a few major flaws. We have a story that's a bit bland, characters that are hard to care about and a visual style that is severely lacking. On the upside we have mostly good actors, a good orchestral score and fair entertainment as long as it lasts. The next time around i hope they go for a more natural look, skip the CGI and work harder on the script. Unfortunately, this movie is mediocre.",5,1,3,17 July 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Better than i thought
","I had heard a lot of bad things about this installment in the Die Hard-series. That the good old catch-phrase was even deprived of it's 'f-word'. While that did sound lame, i decided to give it a fair try. And it was a lot better than what i expected.It's not an easy thing following up on the legacy of the first Die Hard-movie. It's one of my absolute favorites in the genre and a classic action movie if ever there was one. It was action-filled, mean and filled with loads of the dirty action scenes that i came to love. Also John McClane was the ultimate action hero. Bruce Willis wasn't filled with steroids like most of the action stars of the time, but he made up for it with loads of attitude and mean spirit. Die Hard 2 and 3 were not as bad as one might have feared, but something was obviously lacking. This fourth movie is also lacking seen from the perspective of the first movie, but it's still a good action movie that doesn't suffer as much from it's rating as i feared.The positive points here is that the pace is quite high through the whole movie. The action scenes are generally very well done and look expensive. Also they don't look too 'plastic' like they tend to do in some movies that rely too heavily on obvious CGI. Also the Die Hard-feeling is quite well preserved, with the fact that McClane is not really your typical omnipotent hero, rather someone who gets the job done even if it's not pretty or sometimes even intentional.I felt the movie had two major cons. First of all, I don't dislike Timothy Olyphant, but i feel he was seriously miscast here. He doesn't have the charisma nor the looks to make a good villain. Die Hard has come to depend on charismatic villains. That is what raised both the first and the third movie above the crowd. The lack of a charismatic villain in the second movie was very obvious, and it's very obvious here too. He's just not evil enough. The second con is the rating problem. It becomes a problem especially because the previous movies were 'all-out' when it came to violence and profanity. I'm not the kind of person who demands gore and blood in movies, but when it becomes very obvious such things are cut out, it does ruin the experience somewhat.There are a few other minor problems in this movie, like a few extremely unlikely scenes where all plausibility is left behind. I won't say what they are but one of them involves a helicopter and a car, and it's very far from any reality. All in all though, i found this to be a quite enjoyable movie. More so than i thought i would. It's not a classic, nor will it ever be, but it's a pretty good continuation of the Die Hard-franchise and also a pretty good action movie in it's own right. I feel that i can recommend it. 7/10.",7,0,1,3 September 2007
Munich," Most interesting movie from Spielberg since Schindlers List
","I'm no huge fan of Steven Spielberg, rather i find him a competent if rather uninteresting film-maker. Especially these past years. Now however, after seeing Munich, i had to re-evaluate my stance somewhat.It is a brave thing Spielberg is doing in this movie. Tolerance for multiple perspectives has declined recently to say the least, and here Spielberg is presenting a movie without clear morals dealing with the touchy subjects of religion and terrorism. And in my opinion the timing is perfect. The ability to not see things in just black and white is what i feel separates intelligent people from fools, and so many people act foolish today just because they don't use that ability. What makes this movie great is the fact that Spielberg never comes even close to justifying the terror attack on the 1972 Olympics in Munich, he just asks if barbaric acts should answered in kind. A just question.The movie itself is well made with excellent acting. Great thought must have gone into the casting process and what we get is near perfection. Eric Bana is excellent as is the rest of his team of assassins. The technical qualities of the movie are excellent, achieving a very 70's feel. But of course the story is the star here and this is by far the most interesting movie from Spielberg since Schindler's List. Unfortunately for him the race for the Oscars was tight this time around with loads of worthy entries, otherwise this would have been a clear-cut contender for several awards.",8,3,4,2 April 2006
The Truman Show," Interesting concept
","With all the reality shows currently on TV it feels almost like the concept presented in 'The Truman Show' would be the next logical step.The Truman show is about the insurance salesman 'Truman' whose life is a TV-show. The biggest reality show in history. He is filmed around the clock and has been for all of his life. The only thing is, he doesn't know it. But now things are happening that makes him question his reality. How will this affect him? 'The Truman Show' is a very entertaining film. Besides the interesting concept presented it is also well written, well acted and masterfully directed. What also makes it entertaining is the way that you feel sympathetic towards the characters, the way that many of them are believable in their artificial way. Jim Carrey does some of his best work here as Truman, far removed from the antics of the Pet Detective.In the end what raises this movie above the crowd is the interesting concept. A concept that should give plenty of food for thought for people with tendencies towards paranoia. It also asks important questions about the importance of freedom vs. security. Questions that are more important today than ever before.I rate this 7/10.",7,3,6,19 January 2005
300," Sorry
","When i saw the trailer for this movie i was intrigued (as was most of the population of the western world judging by message boards and internet forums). The trailer didn't say very much about what the movie would be like though. And i had no reason to expect what this turned out to be: a porn movie...'A porn movie?!' you might ask. Yes, that's right. This is definitely a porn movie. Sure, there is no explicit sex in this movie, but that hardly has anything to do with it. In all other ways this is definitely a porn movie. Just replace all the sex with violence and the whole thing is done. And like a regular porn movie, this becomes tiresome incredibly fast. Unfortunately though there was no way to fast-forward the movie in the theater.What, then, are the characteristics that this movie shares with porn? Simple: 1. We have a meager, almost completely pointless, story that works solely as an excuse for the real purpose of the movie: the porn. Here it's 'We go out to defend our freedom' instead of 'I'm here to fix deine kabel', but the principle remains the same. 2. We have a movie that's (at least) 70% slow-mo. Most of it with sweaty, half-naked muscled bodies moving in rhythm to music. Recognize that? 3. We have dialog that ranges between ominously pompous to exceptionally pathetic. Most of it is rather pointless though as it's more or less interludes between bloodshed.Saying, and accepting, that this is porn is one thing. But the question, as always, is: is it entertaining? The answer i have to say is 'not very'. I know that a lot of people love this movie, but i can't for the life of me understand why. This is one of those cases where the trailer worked a lot better than the movie itself. Sure, the battles here are not poorly done. Mostly they look OK (although not stunning). But the fact is that after seeing people chop each other up in slow-motion for ten minute it becomes rather tedious. And then you have to consider that this movie is almost two hours long... Blood squirts, limbs are torn etc. etc.I usually have a problem with movies that mess with history (i guess that's one of the problems of being somewhat of a history-buff), but in this movie it didn't bother me. The Persians could as easily be called 'The Orcs' or something in this movie. They fight with what is obviously trolls, goblins and giants, and their famous king Xerxes is a 3-metre tall transsexual... So honestly it's impossible to take this seriously. So arguing about historical accuracy and racism feels completely moot. They haven't violated history, they have thrown it out the window. And somehow that feels better.In a way, i really wanted to like this movie. I like movies that look good, i love action movies. I also like sword-play. But i didn't like this. I just can't stand this porn-type of movies. Maybe it's a sign that i'm getting older, the fact that i can't stand movies that have no story and nothing to offer except splattering blood. And even the blood-splattering has had it's bar raised in the last few years, so not even there does this movie measure up. I would rather watch 'Gladiator' or 'Lord of the Rings' again any day of the week. Sorry Zack Snyder, although i still loved 'Dawn of the Dead'.3/10.",3,2,5,20 May 2007
Jackie Brown," Underrated
","Being a huge fan of Tarantinos earlier efforts Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction expectations were of course high. Especially since Jackie Brown is based on the Elmore Leonard novel 'Rum Punch'. And Elmore Leonards stories usually fit the big screen very well, they are actually one of the rare occasions where i usually prefer the film to the novel.Tarantino sets a different mood here compared to the more frantic and violent Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. This is more of a slow crime story that focuses more on being cool than being shocking. I think this movie works very well despite the slow pace which seems to put a lot of people off. Mainly i think it works because the actors are all giving it their best (the casting is also excellent) while Tarantino seems to handle the whole story more gently than in Pulp Fiction. He doesn't stress it, he doesn't run the risk of over-doing the 'cool' parts. The end result is enjoyable but a lot more somber than what you're used to from Tarantino.All in all i feel this movie is underrated. It's enjoyable, well made and stylish. Recommended to those not demanding all movies to head on at breakneck speed. I rate it 7/10.",8,111,132,29 October 2004
Sin City," Amazing
","It's not often, but once in a while when i watch a movie i feel that i'm watching something truly unique. And that is one of the most rewarding things that can happen while watching a movie. 'Sin City' is unique.It's hard to know where to start when reviewing this movie. It's really something that has to be experienced. And i can immediately say that it will certainly not be for everyone. It's broken-up storyline, it's excessive violence and comic-book style hardly suits everyone. But for me it was a feast for the eyes.And 'a feast for the eyes' is also the first impression as well as the lasting one. How insanely well-made the visuals are in this movie. Every frame of the movie is just so incredibly well-made and thought out. The elegant use of color vs. black-and-white, the comic-book hues. Everything about Sin City just looks amazing.The second lasting impression for me was the acting. Sometimes, once in a rare while, directors manage to get the absolute best out of their actors. This is one of those times. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl.. I could really mention all of the cast because they all perform wonderfully. It just seems like every single actor was so well tuned into the project that it was natural for them to act the way they do. Outstanding.Last but not least, the third lasting impression is just how violent this movie is. I'm usually no fan of excessive violence, simply because there is seldom a need for it. Here though it's done with more style and flare than in most cases and i wasn't really bothered with it. Also the use of colors lessen the effect, giving it all the more of the comic-book feeling.Trying to summarize this review is not easy. This is an outstanding movie in my opinion. I wouldn't rate it as the best i've seen this year, but by far the most interesting. I would also have to say that it's perhaps the best comic-book adaption i've seen to date, which is to say a lot considering how many such movies have come out in the last few years. The movie rises above the competition not least because it really feels like a comic-book. I was very much reminded of the computer game 'Max Payne' myself. Both that game and this movie capitalizes on just how atmospheric a comic book can be.In the end this is a beautiful, amazingly stylish, wonderfully acted movie. It guards it's comic-book roots carefully and makes the most of them. The directing felt sensitive and with a definite fingertip feeling. One of the movie experiences of this year for sure. I rate it 8/10.",8,0,1,10 May 2005
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A complete waste of time
","I know that Michael Bay is the king of crap, and in that regard slamming one of his movies for being a jumbled mess is probably pointless. But still, despite myself I enjoyed the first two Transformers-movies. The first more than the second, but the second was alright all things considered. There has always been a mental cramp when it comes to comic-relief and the scripts have always been paper-thin. But something still appealed to me, I guess I could blame my 1980's childhood with a box full of Transformers-toys.First of all, I said before that the scripts were paper-thin for the previous Transformers-movies. Considering that, this movie seems written on a napkin and then added to and subtracted from in a system of loose papers. Then someone dropped the pile of papers and all the pages got mixed up and nothing was where it was supposed to be... But Michael Bay seemed to say 'screw it, we'll just shoot the movie anyway'. If I say that this movie makes no sense, I'm being as kind as I could ever be. Most of the time it's just a confused mess of events piled on top of each other. There is no cohesion at all, there is no plausible connection to the story from the first two movies. I understand that the writers were probably struggling here to find a new approach and create something out of nothing story-wise. But they chose the wrong direction. Completely.Second point, this movie is almost one hour too long. There are so many places where this movie could have been cut, trimmed and polished. It would even have helped with the story because it's such a mess now that you could remove most of it without it really detracting from your understanding.Third point, this movie wastes a few pretty good actors. And no, I don't mean Gray's Anatomy, but rather John Malkovich and Frances McDormand. I think that for them this was a fire-and-forget movie. Just go in there, do the scenes, forget about it and smile when you see your bank-draft. Because people are not the main thing here, the special effects are. There is no room for characters, proper dialog or building good drama. It seems like Bay sat in his directors chair and said 'Oh, these people have been talking for almost a minute, let's have a robot smash through the wall and break something before people fall asleep'.In the end this really is a complete waste of time. Special effects are, just like in the previous movies, very well done indeed. Product placements are very obvious and hugely embarrassing for all involved, especially for the companies that payed to be shown in such a crap movie. I guess if you are twelve years old and have ADD there might be something here for you, but everyone else should just stay away. This is a brainless blockbuster in every wrong way imaginable.",Null,1,4,14 November 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," Disappointment
","I thought the first 'Bourne Identity' with Matt Damon was a good agent thriller. Both when it came to acting and action. But this second installment fails to deliver, mostly because of clumsy action sequences.Agent Jason Bourne tried to hide from the agency he worked for. But now they have found him and framed him for murder. He has to use his skills to survive and clear his name.The set-up here is pretty much as it was in the first movie. We have our hero and we have the mystical government agency hunting him. But several things are missing that made the first movie great. First of all the story feels uninteresting here. We have seen it all before, and seeing Bourne run around the same way (for the same reasons) as in the first movie holds a limited appeal. Also Bourne never feels out-gunned the way he does in the first movie. Here it feels like he is the one running the show, while he tried desperately to stay alive and mostly had to run in the first movie.But the main drawback is without doubt the action sequences. When is Hollywood going to learn not to let a spastic handle the camera?! As soon as something happens (a fight, a car chase, someone shooting) the camera starts shaking uncontrollably. This is a popular Hollywood-technique. Especially when using actors who can't fight properly, because when you shake the camera like this it's impossible to see what's going on. Unfortunately this also rather limits the entertainment value to say the least.So, with a more interesting story and camera work worth the name this could have been great. Matt Damon is still good, Karl Urban is vicious as his opponent and Brian Cox has long since perfected his 'evil-agency-boss'. This experience is sad, not just because of what it is, but also because of what it COULD have been. I rate it 5/10.",5,0,2,23 January 2005
Jurassic Park," Stands the test of time
","I remember seeing 'Jurassic Park' for the first time in the theater when it came out. It was probably one of the defining moments for me when it came to movies. It was magic, pure and simple. Of course, i wasn't very old and far from as blasé as i am today. But still, i can't shake that memory.Watching the movie now though, with a bit more sober eyes, proves that it is a very competent movie. It might not be the magic show it was when i saw it for the first time, but how could it be? We have seen everything from Transformers to aliens and every critter imaginable come to life on the screen since then. What was groundbreaking and hot in 1993, is such standard-fare in 2007 that you're more surprised if a movie doesn't have huge impossible creatures running around. Or well, that might not be true, but it's commonplace to be sure.What surprised me the most was the fact that the movie has aged rather gracefully. It's almost 15 years old now and it feels like the special effects industry has taken leaps since then. But the effects in 'Jurassic Park' still look great for the most part. Sure, they are less 'there' than the effects today and some effects look rather dated. But for the most part the illusion is intact. And that's important, because this movie is of course about illusions. And when the illusion is believable and you let yourself get immersed into it, you get one of the best adventure movies...ever.Complaining about the lack of pulse-raisers and heartbeat in many adventure- and action-movies feels almost moot at this point. I've done it in what feels like half my reviews. But the argument is still valid, a movie like this one needs something to raise the pulse and make you sit on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie. This one has something like that. It starts out rather calm, but with a clear sense of impending doom. And then, when it happens, it doesn't let you go until the very last frames. What is perhaps most impressive is that it does this without excessive use of neither violence nor blood. Of course there is blood and violence, there has to be. But it's used sparingly, and therefore to greater effect when it does happen. And Spielberg might not be my favorite director, but you can't say that he's not a highly competent man. He plays this movie like a grand piano, finding the right pace, the right tone and the right moods at the right moment. The result is a movie with hardly a single dull moment.In the end this movie has stood the test of time better than i expected. And still, fourteen years later, i found it to be exciting, well written and highly entertaining. I rate it 8/10.",8,2,4,13 August 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Great
","I think like most people who are fans of the series, i dreaded to see this movie. That's also why i waited a few weeks after the premiere before actually going (and another few weeks before writing about it). I guess the thing i was most afraid of was the whole 'another episode of Simpsons, just 90 minutes long'. And was it? Both yes and no.Making a movie out of The Simpsons seems like a long overdue project. The South Park movie was released long ago after all and The Simpsons have all the elements you need for a good movie. I guess the only problems really would be originality and the fact that if you want the series to continue after the movie, you can't really change all that much.I can begin by saying that while this movie wasn't really that original (the story is very much like the series after all) this is still a very entertaining movie. And it didn't actually feel like an overly long episode of the series either. Rather it felt like a real movie with a proper story arc and time line.The real winner here though is the pace. This movie moves at breakneck speed with jokes coming constantly both left and right. It reminds me of movies like Airplane! where there almost always something funny going on. Here they also have a lot of stereotypes and well-known characters to play with and use for effect.Honestly i can say that i don't think a movie based on The Simpsons could have been done much better. It's entertaining, quick-paced, a real movie (when you look at the script and the story) and the look is classic Simpsons with just a little more visual flare added. Maybe i would have liked a storyline that was a bit more drastic and had a more dramatic impact on the Simpsons universe. But in the end i have to be satisfied with this movie. It's great.8/10",8,0,1,26 September 2007
V for Vendetta," A pleasant surprise
","I didn't know what to expect from this movie really. That the Wachowski-brothers produced it didn't really tell me anything. Somehow i have the feeling that the first Matrix-movie was more or less the highpoint of their creativity, the sequels were definite disappointments and beside their visual sense they are not a reason for me to watch a movie any more.I guess more than anything i watched this expecting an action-movie. This is something else though. Sure there are a few action sequences in the movie and generally they are reasonably well-made (although not really very spectacular). So if it's not an action-movie, what is it? Well, it felt to me like some sort of mix between Orwell's '1984' and a superhero-comic. Much of the time the movie is devoted to semi-philosophical discussions about the value of freedom and views on justice. I guess this might put some people off, not least because it's always odd to see someone wearing an expressionless mask talk so much.The fascist-future thing has been done so many times in my opinion that i had a hard time seeing what news 'V for Vendetta' could actually bring to the table. But still it's not a bad take on the genre, and the fact that it's very distinctly British helps as well to separate it from the pack. There are quite a lot of clichÃ©s (not least when it comes to the dictator and his appearance) but i could stomach most of them. The acting in the movie is OK and Hugo Weavings voice is enough filled with expression to make up for the lack of facial movement or other expressions.I guess whether you will like this or not depends on how much quasi-philosophical discussions you can accept, especially when these discussions happen where most people would expect blazing guns. In that respect it's much like the Matrix-sequels in that it's less action and more talking. The difference in my opinion is that 'V for Vendetta' is a better movie for it while the Matrix-sequels lost all their appeal without the fast pace and gun ballet. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie and i think many others were too. The fact that the result had very little to do with my expectations just heightened the positive feelings.

The Island," Not the mess i feared it would be
","Living in backwoods Sweden it's always custom to hear a lot of things about movies before the finally reach us out here. And this movie was more or less written down before it even arrived. Attendancy was poor, the studio blamed the actors for being.. well terrible actors! The actors blamed the studio for poor marketing. It all seemed like a piece of crap that nobody really wanted to take responsibility for. After actually seeing the movie i sort of wonder why.Michael Bay is one of the most awful directors active today. He completely lacks all sensitivities vital to a successful director. He has no sense of pace, no sense of mood and absolutely no sense at all when it comes to temperance. Bay is more or less just about one thing: spend as much money as possible and make as much noise as you can while doing it. Considering his previous works i guess they must have had him restrained during the first half-hour of the movie because it's actually quite calm and controlled.The actors are the main upside to the movie i would have to say. Glorious computer effects and action scenes with dozens of cars being smashed, helicopters exploding and people flying left and right are commonplace today. So that's not really an incentive for me to see a movie. Good acting on the other hand, now that is something i'm willing to pay for. And i think i get my money's worth here. Scarlett Johansson is decent enough as the female protagonist and Ewan McGregor makes his usual solid performance, although in my opinion Sean Bean outshines them both. They show once again what 'The Bourne Identity' taught Hollywood, that even in action movies decent actors go a long way.So what's the backside? Well i would have to say Michael Bay. Because after a while it seems he managed to escape from his restraints and from then on it's full speed ahead and 'insert earplugs'. Bay goes ahead and does what he always does, let's a couple of dozen million dollars explode with loud bangs. All accompanied by shaking cameras, epilepsy-inducing editing and loud music. So while i would probably call this the best movie Michael Bay has managed to make to this day, it's not thanks to his directing, rather despite it.Beside his major flaws as a director the other cons of the movie sort of fade away. Oh, i noticed them (like extremely obvious and silly product placement, a plot with more than a couple of holes etc.) but i didn't mind them much. In the end this is an entertaining ride, entertainment for as long as it lasts. And simple mindless fun is not something to despise, just as long as you realize what it is you're watching. 'The Island' is far from the mess i feared it would be, and it's a lot better than most crap i've seen in theaters this summer. I rate it 6/10.",6,0,0,3 September 2005
