Resident Evil: Afterlife," Good film but still left you wanting more
","The storyline was good and although it was not engaging and complete compared to the last film RE:Extinction.The film contains cool fight scenes with slow mo thrown in often, what make the film is Milla Jovovich's acting and stunt skills. Ali Later as Claire is decent her but character is not developed, and importantly I think Wentworth Miller was not used properly to portray Chris other than make indirect reference to his character in prison break.I found myself asking when Milla is in the plane she get injected with a antidote for the T-Virus by Albert Wesker she thanks him for making her Human, now does she have her Super-Human strength or not that is never answered in the letter part of the movie.Overall good film better in 3D yet at the end makes you question: IS THAT IT?",7,16,34,15 September 2010
Megamind," Funny enough to keep you watching for more
","This film was very funny and i feel the cast was chosen very well there was a lot of character development which added depth to the growing relationship of Megamind and Roxanne(Fay.although it felt it fit the typical genre of super hero comic book films and a lot of people will find it to be not like despicable me that does nothing to reduce in the quality of the script. The comedy was good with all the parent laughing to the jokes, like the reference to the God-father etc.I think overall the film will be able to reach out to kids and parents alike the twists will keep you seated till the end. The moral of the story Destiny is the path you chose not what is chosen for you, 7.5/10 a good family film",7,14,16,23 December 2010
