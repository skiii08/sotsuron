Casablanca," Good Film to Watch
","Individuals are always dealing with war inside themselves. Whether it's a war between jealousy, self-centered behavior,neutrality,fear, or love, it's important for people to let go of those emotions and go for those feelings that are within your heart, even if it hurts you, or if you have contradicting feelings about someone or something. People can't always hide from their feelings. They have to go out into the world and release them to the person that an individual cares about.Bogart's acting portrays all of these characteristics well in this movie. The entire acting in the movie was great and well timed. The romantic twists throughout the film were good,romantic, and very suspenseful as the viewers are glued into the interesting triangle between Rick,Ilsa, and Victor.The cinematography throughout the movie was good with a balance of soft lighting on the lead woman,bright, sharp focused contrast on the leading men as throughout the interior and exterior scenes, and the dark, gloomy, climatic clear contrast on Bogart's face was well shown to display his saddened angry mood at Ilsa's betrayal at the train station. The use of the piano, live bands, and recorded music was used well throughout the film. The use of depth of field was used well.If you're interested in watching a romantic suspenseful drama, then this movie would be a great film to watch.",8,0,3,15 October 2009
Citizen Kane," A Good Film to Watch.
","It's important for all people to explore the world and pursue their dreams and goals for themselves. It's important for people to be happy with their lives and not force people to help them become successful. Money, greed, and selfishness don't bring happiness to someone that was forced to get into a career at an early age or of any age at all. It's important for a person to enjoy their childhood while looking ahead towards a brighter, happy future.The actor's portrayal of Kane and his colleagues was shown very well throughout the film. The juxtaposition of the flashbacks and the present time research of Kane's life were used well and made the plot flow through fast and easy for the viewers to understand what was happening in the film. The news reel and the voice narration of providing the back story of Kane's life and death was effective to set up the main idea that the viewers are going to see and find more information about Kane's life and what the meaning of the last word that Kane said at his deathbed was all about. The use of framing and cinematography was used well throughout the film. The lighting on the back of the actors and the front of the actors was really dramatic, sharp in focus in the depth of field, and kept people guessing what was going on inside their minds and the emotions that they're feeling at the present time as Kane and the reporter are searching for success. In other scenes, the use of lighting was soft and sometimes balanced through the film. The double exposures in some parts of the film were used well.Overall, it's a good film to watch. It has a great moral story that everybody should follow in their lives.",9,10,14,13 October 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Very Interesting Movie to Watch!!
","Wars, whether you're fighting against your brothers sister, relative, or if your fighting in a foreign war, are very horrific times with bad results. Wars are always constantly tearing families apart just to protect our country from harm's way.The view of war in the United States in this movie is shown really well. The cinematography was very dramatic in the red and sepia-tone brown hues in the dramatized scenes. The special effects in the movie were excellent. Theacting was excellent and their actions kept me interested in seeing what was going to happen in the movie. The music written for the movie set the tone for all the scenes perfectly. The mood of the music for the dramatized chaotic scenes were often dark with louder thematic tones in a familiar tone that is later used for food and cartoon shows throughout the 20th century to the present, while happier scenes had calm and patriotic music that kept viewers in their united, peaceful American spirit.I would recommend this movie to anybody that is interested in a good drama and is interested in learning about American history and the terrible effects of war.",10,8,16,14 September 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," An Okay Anti-Cold War Film
","In times of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union have competed against each other in getting their first spaceships into space,building nuclear weapons that could destroy all human kind in one day, and the battle between communism and the free enterprise system. Although war is a bad thing that'll end with bad consequences, Kurbick direction into the film was good and to the point in showing what would happen if the United States had used nuclear weapons on Russia during the Cold War.The cinematography in the film was good. The various shooting angles on the US Air Force planes flying towards Russia in close up views was good. The use of dramatic lighting shined on the generals, ambassadors, and the president was clear in focus, well lit on their faces, and very dramatic sense of light that establishes the characters as important, privileged leaders that are willing to fight and prevent the war against Russia. The lighting on the pilots and the soldiers fighting outside a building were dull in their mid-tone gray contrast emphasizing the gloomy mood and their need to be the people that'll be disposed in the fight against Russia, as a result of their deadly weapons. The use of back light on the general sitting in a chair was really nice. The special effects that were used for a full-view airplane flying towards Russia made the plane feel like it was flying in the older Superman series style. The duration of the plot throughout the film dragged causing the overall mise-en-scene of the film to drag and cause the viewer to lose interest in the film.Although the screenplay dragged the plot and storyline throughout the film, the overall message was strong and to the point. If you're interested in seeing a Cold War film, come see this film.",6,0,5,4 December 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," Best Movie of the 1940's!!
","During the Great Depression and today's recession, it's important for families to never give up hope on themselves and keep looking foreword and ahead to the future as they want to advance towards a better life in an economic, political, and social standpoint. Sometimes,money doesn't usually bring happiness and success for people, only family, respect for others, and love are what keeps a family together. No matter how many times a person hasn't succeeded in a goal, they continue to persevere until they make themselves happy and successful in their goals as well as making their family proud.It was Steinbeck's novel and the screen writing is what made this movie stand out as the best movie of 1940.The narrative writing of the film was full of realism by showing us what it would have been like to live in a poor family that's been evicted by their home by greedy land owners, banks, gangs, and sheriffs that are supposed to protect the people from harm's way in the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. The narrative allows viewers to feel the experience and be in the movie as the actors were reliving real life experiences of moving away from home,exploring life, traumatized by death, despair, anger, and hope of finding a new life. The overall acting in this movie was excellent and well shown through their actions, the directing, and the script. The use of real natural wind, light, and the outdoor setting also made the story even more realistic and believable within the time period of the depression giving the film a more realistic feel. The photography and the use of the camera lens was excellent!! The juxtaposition of the two pictures of images in Muley's flashback and the movement through the states as shown by the signs in the moving time period, flowed well with ease through the story and adding the dimension of how the family drove and persevered to reach their goals and their attempts to save their homes from destruction. The use of shallow depth of field, lights and darks on the actor's faces, and the dark and light contrast in the sky was used very well in the film. The dark contrast and shadows brought out the mood of fear,anger, worry, and sadness that each of the characters expressed throughout the film during the tough economic crisis that was very emotional for the entire United States. Lighting created a sense of emotion, depth,mood, and how we see these characters in the film. Lighter outdoor scenes in the film were very opportunistic and bright as the families were looking into a happier life in the future.This's the best movie that Zannuck has ever made in his life!! I would recommend this movie to everybody that needs to be influenced and want to persevere into having a better life for their family during the recession or need to be cheered up. It's an excellent movie overall!!",10,0,0,5 October 2009
The Graduate," Awesome Film to Watch!!
","Moving ahead into the future can either be exciting or scary for an individual.It can be very scary if the individual has no idea how to let out their emotions and go achieve their goals and desires that they want in life. It's important for people to be honest with one another as well as themselves in life. If there's something that the person wants, then they need to get the courage to get it, despite the other individual's opinion against your goal. Never do anybody else's bidding for them because they'll prevent you from obtaining your goal or that special somebody that you love. Otherwise, you'll regret it in the end.The Graduate is the best movie that shows how an individual can be determined to be with that special somebody for the rest of their lives and achieve that goal, through many obstacles that block their path. It's important not to have an affair with somebody's mother because they're afraid to let their emotions out about the mother's daughter that they love so much that they'll do anything to win her love. The plot is easy to follow and captures the viewer's interest right away. The use of back-lighting and shadows on the character's faces are great and dark in contrast through the artificial lighting. The depth of field on Hoffman as he's watching television was shot well. Selective editing was used well to show Ben's path in the diving suit as he tests the new suit in the pool. The overall acting in the film was excellent.If you're interested in viewing a classic coming of age film, then this film is great film to watch. With it's interesting screenplay, great cinematography, great acting, and good plot, The Graduate is an awesome film to watch!",10,0,0,15 December 2009
Pulp Fiction," Most Confusing Film to Date
","American culture has changed significantly throughout the decades.What was once a peaceful society where families were living in nice houses and a clean, safe neighborhood where drug overdoses, robberies,gangs, and murders weren't a concern.Today,in times of recession or desire,people will find other ways of obtaining money and valuable items,and giving illegal drugs to obsessive users through the use of robbery,trading, and murder. It is not necessary to harm other people for no reason, as a result of greed or desire. It's important to redeem yourself from a life of crime and focus on turning yourself around into a whole new good direction into doing the right things in life.Although the acting was portrayed well throughout the film by Willis, Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman,and the use of the cinematography and lighting was excellent,the screenplay written for this movie was horrible!! The plot duration and the screen time dragged on and on throughout the movie,giving the film the feeling that it's never going to end in most scenes. The juxtaposition of the present and past alternative plot twists were confusing to follow and it would have been better if the plot flowed through smoothly through one storyline. The offensive language in the film was overused too much in every scene.The use of the cinematography was excellent. The cinematographer's use of natural and non-naturalistic lighting, contrast, and shadows were used well in the indoor scenes. The cinematographer's use of the close ups, crane shots, long takes, dolly shots were all used to create suspense, and make the viewers wonder what's going to happen to the major characters in the film.",5,0,2,10 November 2009
