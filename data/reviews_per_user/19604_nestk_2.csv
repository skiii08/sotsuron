The Devil's Advocate," very silly and stupid movie
","This is a very silly and stupid movie.. the acting is OK but the story is very silly and rather just for the lovers of  the genre.. it is for people with religious interest or who like stories with devils, angels and such things.. I didn't like this movie at all and I regretted the time I lost watching it.",1,13,46,18 January 2004
Lilo & Stitch," cute Movie rahter for the little ones
",This is a nice welldone movie.. it is kind of 'cute' and some how rather for kids than for grown up's who like computer animated films.it is more like CARTOON rather than something like Monster Inc.So if u have small kids it could b fun to watch it with them otherwise u it ll b kind of silly .. but to be fair.. its very well done and funny.,7,0,1,11 January 2004
