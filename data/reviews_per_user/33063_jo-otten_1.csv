Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Great decors, great music, great characters
","I watched this movie together with my husband in cinema. I liked this Sherlock Holmes even better than the first one! There is a great atmosphere, created by beautiful decors and great music. Some people might not like the slow-motion action-scenes, but see them as a parody on movies like James Bond an you will cherish them like I did (think on the effect Inglorious Basterds had on you)! Although the title makes you expect a dark movie, this is a cheerful movie with a lot of humour, and not very much of a shadow. Some critics criticise the movie for it's thin plot line. I don't agree. There is really a lot happening! Maybe some things aren't very likely to happen in the real world, but in my opinion this is one of the charmes of Sherlock Holmes. The historical settings are by the way very plausible. Characters are quite multi- dimensional...Holmes is not only a genius, but he is also a little bit pschycho (in a good way) en turns out to be quite lonely sometimes. Here you see one of the strenghts from the first movie again. Although my husband and I mostly watch art-house-movies, we enjoyed watching this movie, because this film was so well-made and so very entertaining!",8,1,2,3 January 2012
