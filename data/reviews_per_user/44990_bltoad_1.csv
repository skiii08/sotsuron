The Blair Witch Project," Brought me to my Knees, The best film from Sundance
","Halfway through the premiere screening the girls next to me were so frightened they were crying. I was literally trying to climb into myself to get away. My heart was racing, I was actually having a panic attack. The Blair Witch Project is not a movie, It is a phenomenon. A introspective jouney into the very nature of fear. The Blair With Project is to camping what Jaws was to swimming in the ocean.",10,2,5,9 March 1999
