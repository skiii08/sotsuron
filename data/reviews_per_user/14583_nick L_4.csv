The Blair Witch Project," Pure psychological terror
","I have never been so drained, physically and mentally, than when walking out of the cinema after seeing this, surely a modern classic, and quite possibly an Exorcist' for the MTV generation. We all know now of the legend of the Blair Witch and how three young and arrogant students got lost in the woods, their only legacy being their footage. It is this knowledge of the film that has perhaps partially ruined the experience of this film for me and many others. I can only imagine how terrified I might of been had I believed that what I was seeing was real, as those who saw it at Sundance did. Yet the film holds together brilliantly despite, or maybe even because of, the hype that has surrounded it's entrance to the UK.	What the film does best is to build up the tension, almost silently, and allow one thing to go wrong after the other before dropping the crew (and us) in a living hell, within reach of all of us. It is hard to define the point at which they realise that they really are going to die, because it all builds up on different layers. The genius is that we are seeing this arrogant bunch do everything wrong, yet we know that we would do exactly the same thing in their position. We are annoyed with them, but we don't want them to die, even though we know they will. 	Because we never see exactly what it is which is stalking them, we are left to imagine something far worse than CGI or animatronics could conjure up. The sound effects paint everything for us. The gore is minimal, but devastating. The design of the film (the stick figures, the house, the hand prints) is extremely effective. But what the film gives us more than anything is indescribable fear which oozes out of the film at every moment. The pace never lets up, and we are left every bit as exposed to the terror on the screen as the characters are, thanks to the ultra realism provided by the vérité style of the film. Thank God Hollywood didn't pick up on this, for it would have no doubt tainted the film with effects, music, gore and A-List actors. There is nothing intellectual or clever' about the film, but that is not the point, because this reduces the audience to a primal state, turning us into the closest we have ever become to cavemen.	I don't think that it was a fluke that this film was a success, and I fail to see how anyone could be less than terrified by it. I have noticed that those friends of mine not scared by it are not the most imaginative people I know, and if there is one thing that could have been added to this film, I think it would be a glimpse of the witch, and JUST a glimpse, for anything more than that would render the film dead. I believe it would have worked every bit as well as the gore did, for as I walked out of the foyer, the dialogue that was ringing around my head to that final, truly disturbing image was not Heather's now infamous monologue in the tent but rather the early description of the witch by a local. The key to this films success is really the fact that you are not once spoon-fed a CGI ghoul or witch, but are treated like an intellectual, educated filmgoer, who can imagine the witch perfectly well (although it would still have been nice to see it).",Null,2,3,24 November 1999
Alien: Resurrection," A flawed, fascinating and distinctly Freudian monster movie.
","I have to admit that this really is not the film that I had anticipated for so many months leading up to the release. Viewing some snapshots on the web page, I could almost feel that Gallic style that had oozed out of Jeunet's City of the Lost Children in this, the fourth of the Alien franchise. Yet, Alien Resurrection manages to be the most unremarkable of a series of films that has virtually defined the modern sci-fi action film. And while it may not be as frustratingly hamstrung as Alien3 was (which I actually thought was far better than people gave it credit for), Alien 4 has little of the action, suspense, tragedy, plot and unique style that the three previous films gave us. Perhaps that's just a bit too harsh, but for a film with such high production values and from such a diverse series of films, I don't think it's fair for the audience to have to put up with such an anti-climax (although scribe Joss Whedon, has said that this film is merely a prologue to the planned fifth film, which he will now script).For those of you that opted not to see Alien3, at the end Ripley chose to sacrifice herself so that the alien inside her would never be born. 200 years on, however, scientists on the USS Auriga have been attempting to clone Ripley so that they can get at the Alien Queen she was carrying when she died. Ripley's gene pool has been mixed with that of the Alien's, meaning that she is now a sadistic schizophrenic with superhuman strength and acid for blood. However, the scientists keeping Ripley overestimate the power of a glass box and (Surprise, Surprise) the aliens break out, causing the inevitable mayhem and frantic running around corridors. The band of likeable but morally cloudy alien fodder (re - the nostromo crew of Alien, the marines in Aliens, and the er... murderers and rapists of Alien3) are this time provided by the crew of the Buffy, sorry I mean Betty, the pirate ship which delivered the bodies needed to incubate the alien embryos. Jeunet regulars Perlman and Pinon make up part of the crew, while Winona Ryder is call, the ships engineer. A slight problem occurs when the survivors realise that the ship is heading straight for earth, finally allowing the Aliens the buffet meal they surely deserve for turning up in space uninvited so many times. Along the way, the Betty crew must weed out the traitor in their group and a confused Ripley must decide where her destiny lies.Writer Joss Whedon really has tried to make as good an action movie as he possibly can (and he can make good ones ... Speed). That's fine for a Die Hard movie , but it sure as hell is not what is wanted in an alien movie. Jeunets freaky French style is similarly unsuitable, due to being overly stylistic (which, again can work well in the right movies as his previous features have shown us) and never gels properly with Whedons script. However, the most excruciating aspect if the entire film has to be the way that so many elements are interchangeable with previous Alien films, notably Aliens. For example, the crew of the Betty, with their sexism and gung-ho attitude are bad copies of the marines in Aliens, with Perlman's Johner particularly similar to Bill Paxton's Hudson. Also, Ryders sole purpose in the movie seems to be to act as Weavers foil and someone who can outfox the males of the movie, in true newt style. But while Newt was endearing, touching and yet remarkably unnauseating, Ryder seems lost and dizzy for the entire movie.But it's not all bad news. Weaver gives possibly her most varied and difficult interpretation of Ripley yet, proving that she is one of the worlds most underrated actresses and making Ripley by far the most complex character ever to have appeared in a series of sci-fi films. And if this is the prologue to a more eventful fifth film, this could work better in context (a La Alien3). There are also some gruesome and highly inventive death scenes and the design and FX of the film are stunning . The highlight of the film has to be the truly suspenseful and original underwater chase, closely followed by a dark and tragic scene in which Ripley discovers the not so successful Ripley clones, with one agonisingly alive. The scene allows Weaver to shine fully and I was stunned after seeing that scene for the first time. Overall, the film is a very mixed bag indeed, with some good ideas, underutilised ideas, brilliant ideas and just plain stupid ideas.",10,0,1,24 November 1999
Dark City," A dazzling, unique and jaw-dropping movie experience
","When buying dark city recently in a special offer, I have to admit that I was not really expecting much. However, my initial reservations proved to be totally wrong, and I implore anyone with similar feelings to go and see it to be as gob-smacked as I was.The movie provides several jaw-dropping set-pieces and is a hell of a lot better paced than most hollywood movies. Right from the perfectly understated opening scene to the final, climatic battle, your attention is never allowed to lapse. I will not reveal any plot details to spoil those who have not yet been enlightened, but I will say that the building change scene is the most original set-piece of the 90's. How crap like Armageddon grosses $200million and this little gem only grosses $14million is beyond me, but I hope it gets the following it deserves now it is out on video.When I say this is the best film of the 90's I do not come to that decision likely, but I beg of anyone who loves sci-fi to watch this. You will either love it or hate it. I hope you love it.On a final note, has anyone else noticed how much the Matrix copies this ( the neo 50's design, the flying fight between the good guy and the bad guy). Mail me if you have.",10,0,1,19 August 1999
Event Horizon," 'Alien' meets 'The Shining'. So there.
","I have read more than one review which has used the above statement, and upon viewing this slick but mixed bag of frights, I can see their point.Here are just a few things that this film rips off of 'Alien' & 'The Shining': - In Alien, Ash (played by a non-American actor) is the traitor in the midst. In Event Horizon it's Weir (played by a non-American actor) - The tone is almost identical to Alien, what with a largely unseen enemy and the final race against time (and a ticking bomb) - The 'inventor's block' suffered by Weir is almost identical to and is handled in a very similar (if more clumsy) way to Jack's madness in The Shining. - There are two scenes lifted directly out of The Shining - the beatiful naked woman in the bath who turns nasty and the cascade of bloodHowever, I still found myself enjoying this film immensely and getting completely taken in by it, and the FX and art direction are great. In any case, at least it steals from two good films. There were several good set-pieces throughout (occasionally marred by Anderson's use of over familiar cliches) and some impressive effects shots (the pull back from the space station and the first visit to a zero gravity Event Horizon are perfect examples). For the first hour, the film keeps impressively spooky yet keeping it's tongue firmly in cheek.The downside of the film is the clumsy scripting. To say that the dialogue is cheesy is an insult to dairy products ('we won't need eyes where we're going' and Weir's constant repetition of 'DO YOU SEE!!!' are prime examples of some lazy scripting). The concept that the ship has gone to hell is severely underused, and is really quite a good concept. Although we are given some brief hints of the Event Horizon's journey into hell with the final, squirming log entry, it never develops into the true nightmare we so wish it to, instead opting for done to death 'eerie' corridor walks and some grisly but boring 'Hellraiser'-style make up effects. Yet the film is still entertaining, and we are least given a juicy, explosion fuelled climax., but for all it's efforts it remains flawed. At least it is this good, given the pitfalls of such an over used genre.",7,0,1,6 November 1999
