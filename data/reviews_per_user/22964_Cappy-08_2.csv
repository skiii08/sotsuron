Requiem for a Dream," Unforgettable
","I just watched this movie last night on television, and let me just say.... This was one of the most engrossing, emotionally involving, gut wrenching and thought provoking movies I have ever seen.The portrayal of the characters by all four main cast members were absolutely perfect, especially Ellen Burstyn, whose powerful perfomance of an elderly woman addicted to diet pills, blew me away. Her final scenes in the movie were enough to make me cry the first time I ever had in a movie.Overall a five star movie. Exceptional work by aronofsky.",Null,0,1,27 August 2002
Insomnia," Superb
","As Christopher Nolan's follow up to his masterpiece 'Memento,' Insomnia is an excellent film, and will definitely establish Nolan as one of Hollywood's most brilliant directors.Insomnia is a very intense, gripping, and thought-provoking movie, and should not be missed by all people who enjoy taut, heavy, and satisfying thrillers.Extremely Recommended.",10,0,0,24 May 2002
