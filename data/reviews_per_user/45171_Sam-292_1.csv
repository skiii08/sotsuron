The Blair Witch Project," Original? Yes. Any good? Not at all.
","I was dragged in to this movie at the insistence of my friends. I expected it to be bad. I didn't expect it to be terrible. Credit must be given to the directors/writers for their original and even creative approach to the filming of the movie. More credit must given to the marketing team, however, for their ability to devise a campaign to actually make this movie look a little bit good.Luckily I realized within the first 30 minutes that the film was a complete waste of time and money so I walked out and demanded a refund. The next day, the friends that had originally persuaded me to see the movie worshipped the ground I walked on. Stay at home and watch the news, it's better.",Null,0,0,16 December 1999
