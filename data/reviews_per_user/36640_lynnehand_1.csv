Mission: Impossible III," Where is the duh duh duh duh?
","I am watching this right now. It's not awful, but it is far from great.OK - it's an action film and I liked the bit when he leaves the phone next to the radio - but....Where is the signature tune of MI? It's just not the same without it.Hubby and I are sitting here trying to fill in the right moments with the do do do do - duh duh duh duh. But we really need the sound track.As far as I can remember the first and second film were filled with this. This is like watching James Bond without the dah dah dah dah der dah dah. You get the idea?",4,0,2,18 November 2006
