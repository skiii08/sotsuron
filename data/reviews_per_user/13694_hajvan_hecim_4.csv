Blade Runner 2049," SLOWEST SEQUEL EVER
","I will not lie, but i've expected this.
First part in 1982 was slow and boring.
This one is even more slow and boring.
Not to mention that it lasts for almost three hours.
They have spent 150.000.000 $ in most boring way ever.
Story and events are full of gaps.
Story is made in a manner that can produce sequel, next year or in next decade.
Harrison Ford obviously was not interested in movie, because his acting is so lame.
Main actor have frozen face, with barely any emotions expressed during movie (lame acting).
Big city where Harrison Ford is hiding is abandoned because of nominal radiation???
Harrison Ford is obviously used to attract fans, because movie without him would be even bigger disaster.
Luckly, I've watched it home, but my wife fell asleep in first half, because she could not watch it any more.",4,1,3,26 December 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," sentinels
","Anyone who doesn't want to know few details should stop reading this. My main problem in this movie (which is great) is that sentinels from the future are just too powerful. I mean they are able to hold multiple mutant powers at once, not even Apocalipse was not so mighty. They can heal, turn to flame or ice or diamond..., shoot energy beams, extremely strong... If you ask me, this is just too much for a machine. Also in the future there are not many humans too, because sentinels can detect ability to pass x gene to children. So, people in charge from time to time should be executed because they'll be on turn to pass x genes on to their children. In general I had great time in cinema, but my problem is that I'm trying always to follow logic in the story",8,0,0,28 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Recycle movie based upon original trilogy
","Unfortunately, this episode did not fulfilled my expectations at all. It is just recycled movie which took some of the parts from original trilogy and have tried to combine it in a new movie 30 years later. Main villain for this part is also very inconclusive, looks more like frustrated teenager who wants to prove everyone he is bad ass at any cost, and there are some minor mistakes in the story. Too bad that after so many years they could not make a movie to be a fine successor in plot and to be memorable. Deserves 6 out of 10 not a star more and this is real, even i am a fan of this serial since i was a kid, and it hurts me more than average fan",3,7,14,23 December 2015
Cloud Atlas," very slow and dull
","Not very often in my life i have opportunity to see a movie with such a high rating (stars in IMDb) to see it later as complete failure. I've entered in this uncommon piece of 7th art with open mind just to be totally disappointed. Movie is so slow and boring and with mostly totally uninterested characters that after about one hour I had to turn it off. I knew the fact that story is a little bit strange and I like to test new experiences in story design. Unfortunately this is such a huge flaw in almost every way and the only interesting parts were some tingling when some murders happen. I've had a lot of experience in my life, so this can be interesting only to people with a low life content in their lives. Maybe upon seeing other reviews many people will disagree with me, but I and my wife just could not watch it any more.",2,4,11,5 February 2016
