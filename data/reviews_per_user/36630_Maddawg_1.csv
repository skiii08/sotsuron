The Blair Witch Project," Uhh, Am I the only one who thought this was about as scary as Count Chocula?
","Was this a P.T. Barnum production or what?  I felt totally used after seeing this pathetic indie.  I mean the web site made it look like this thing might be a really creative new film.  I fell for the bait.  I kept waiting for this thing to get scary. If this was scary, so was that episode of Seinfeld where they got lost in the parking garage. It starts out with this lame attempt to make the thing look like a real amateur documentary. This looked like a bad high school project.  At no time did I believe that these were real film student.  Had they been, they would have failed out semesters earlier.  I kept waiting for this to get scary.  Oh, there is a scary pile of rocks. Eww, there is blue slime on my back-pack. In the 87 minutes of the film I must have looked at my watch 5 times.  The only hoax in the Blair Witch Project was the one played by the marketers on the public.  This was one of the only movies for which I almost asked for a refund.  One last thing.----------BOO!  There, I just saved your seven dollars and you got a bigger scare.",1,0,2,1 August 1999
