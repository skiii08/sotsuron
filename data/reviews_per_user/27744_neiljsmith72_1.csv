Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Bad Move
","I was SO SO SO Disappointed with this movie, I almost cried! To put it bluntly it was one of the worst films ive ever seen.  Script was terrible, no depth in any of the characters, Special effects looked way to computer generated, i.e. Yoda looked terrible, what happened to the models and puppets.  Jar Jar Binks: - I hoped they killed him off within 5 minutes of watching the film.  The only cool character was Darth Maul, but he was killed off too quickly and wasn't in the film enough.  The light sabres, ships etc make it look like it was set as a sequel rather than a prequel. C3PO and R2D2 just were not needed, and look back when watching the originals; you would never have thought Darth Vader was C3PO's creator. What a big mistake that was.  It spoilt the whole Star Wars franchise for me. I'm so glad the people behind the creation of the Star Trek Films don't make appalling cock-ups like this.",4,0,1,6 January 2003
