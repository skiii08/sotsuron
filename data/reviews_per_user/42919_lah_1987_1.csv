Hereditary," Do not see this!
",I am so mad at the 7.8 rating. I just knew this was worth seeing smh i should have done more research. If you filter 1 star reviews you get about 150 and if you filter 10 star reviews you get 70 something. So disappointed. This movie was very slow. Far from scary. A couple of creepy / weird moments.,1,3,6,20 June 2018
