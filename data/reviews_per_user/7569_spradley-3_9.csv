The Equalizer," Wow - unexpectedly awesome!
","I like Denzel but never thought of him as a Jason Bourne type but in this movie, he's definitely up there with Liam in 'Taken'. He doesn't just kick butt, he really kicks it and he looks them straight in the eye when doing it. He's no nonsense, no explaining the situation, no negotiating. The payback in this feels good because the bad guys are so bad - well acted, too. The scenes are done well - setting the mood. The late night diner scenes are great. If you've ever been up in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep, and you go out to the local 24 hr cafe - this is just what you'd picture it would be like. You don't get a lot of detail behind Denzel's character only that he's definitely been through a lot, had a wife, has OCD. His apartment is stark - no decorations, just the necessities to live. No mess. Everything in it's place. Denzel does this characters incredibly well. It's a tough one to play. There's very little emotion even in very emotional situations. Great action - great power. Check it out - highly recommend.",10,0,3,22 October 2016
Knowing," Some parts were good - some were really bad!
","I'll start out by saying that I am a Nicolas Cage fan - big time. I love his movies - usually buy the DVDs and watch over a few times. I also go to movies to be entertained - and don't ask a lot from plots as in the 'National Treasure' series. But this one - there are few if any one-liners - the ones that make movies such as 'Con Air' great viewing. In 'Knowing', the plot is actually pretty good - a time capsule is buried by a grammar school and unearthed 50 years later. One very odd student had written pages filled with numbers, in no recognizable sequence. Cage figures out what the numbers mean and races to prevent or survive the last prediction. However - and here's the 'bad' part of the movie - (SPOILERS NOW!!!) aliens have been hanging around for years, 'whispering' to the odd kid 50 years ago and 'whispering' to her kid in today's world. Then, as the prediction comes to fruition, the aliens take the kids who can hear their 'whispering' along with two of all the animals/life (ala Noah's ark) away to 'rebuild' on another planet. Gawd - the music was awful during the last alien scene! Cage drops to his knees when he sees the space ship, the kids are standing there with rabbits calmly, and the music is blaring crescendo for way longer than was needed. It's like a climax that was supposed to last 5 secs extended to 2 mins. So what were those aliens - who are obviously advanced enough to get here, figure out all the disasters that Earth has endured, figured out which kids and animals to take - out of the goodness of their heart or whatever - and they couldn't figure out a way to shield the earth from the 'disaster'? I guess I could have accepted the alien thing but the aliens looked to 'human'. Why make aliens who are all 'energy' shaped like a human body without skin? Head, two arms, two legs, ... The space ships were a cool design and the last visual effects of the earth were great. Again - too much loud blaring, climatic music. I felt badly for Cage at the end - so hokey. 4/5ths of the movie was pretty good though I missed Cage's one liners. Disappointing ending but not a bad way to spend a rainy day. Entertaining but poorly executed ending.",3,1,3,30 March 2009
Now You See Me," Loved it! Action - great illusions - kept you guessing.
","OK - while not the best of the best - this movie is way ahead of most of the movies out right now. I really like Jesse's style of acting - fast talking, great sense of humor - and Woody is always a great supporting (or even lead) actor. Spoilers coming - The objective of the magicians' illusions were not completely altruistic, but pretty close. While Ocean's 11 was fun because of the interaction between the characters, the illusion was for profit, for themselves. The fast pace of 'Now you see me' was good at keeping you from guessing who was 'good' vs who was 'bad'. I'm pretty good at these and I didn't guess it until about 2/3rds in. And I wasn't sure. I like the energy of the characters and the way revenge was metered - which is what it was all about. It wasn't about money - it was about knocking down arrogant, egotistical know-it-alls, which - admit it - feels really good when done right. And since we can only get that satisfaction from movies (not in real life), this is a good movie to see. There's no torture like some revenge movies - this is all pretty tame stuff. But knocks a punch to the 'bad guys'. Anyway - it's not a Bourne, Bond or Die Hard - but it's pretty darn good. Check it out. It definitely will not be the worst movie you've seen lately!",9,3,7,5 July 2013
Taken," Excellent - didn't expect it to be this good!
","Lots of spoilers! I must have seen the previews for 'Taken' between TV programs several times/week and it was beginning to get really irritating. However, there was something about the vigilante plot that made me want to see it. 'Taken' started out a bit slow, with the background of the family - Liam was the Dad who quit his Secret Service job to get closer to his daughter, whom he rarely saw because of his job. His ex-wife remarried an ubra rich guy who upstages him at his daughter's 17th birthday by giving her an incredibly beautiful horse. Liam brought a karaoke machine. This all wraps up nicely in the end - I won't give it all away. So the daughter decides to go to Paris with a friend, pretending to stay at a cousin's place with aunt/uncle who, of course, aren't in Paris - they took a trip somewhere else. So the two girls land in Paris and are immediately hit on by a cute boy who shares a cab with them, checks out their place and calls in their location (and that they're alone)to a ring of international human traffic-ers. The two girls are typical teenagers their first time away from home - freedom clouds judgment - taking rides from strangers in a foreign country - in which neither could speak the language, bragging they're alone, bragging the whole '5th floor' is theirs, and they want to party. Good Lord, write 'stupid' on their foreheads and send in Jason (Friday the 13th). That's where the previews begin - but nothing could prepare me for Liam's strength and drive at finding his daughter. No Jedi tricks here - This guy does not fool around chatting or providing background for the audience who might have dozed off and forgotten the plot. He goes right for the information - and kills anyone in the way - right away - no time for them to plead for their lives or 'James Bond' their way out of his clutches. Liams takes the shot - every time. It feels good - these guys are scum of the scum. 'Taken' gives the audience what they don't get in 'real' life - quick justice for creeps, another chance for parents who should be more careful in sending their kids off places unsupervised - just because other parents aren't taking the time to make sure the 'i's are dotted and 't's crossed for teenage journeys. The films wraps up really nicely, too. The introduction into Liam's type of job at the very beginning of the movie comes in again at the end - like the stuffed bear Ryan brings back for his daughter in 'Red October'. Great directing - action shots are incredibly well done ala Die Hard and Bourne. Pace is fast, steady but with a breath here and there so you're not exhausted by the end of the movie. I haven't seen a good action movie like this since 'Live Free or Die Hard'. This is a good one- don't miss it - in the theater.",10,1,2,14 February 2009
Up," More than fabulous animation - see it with someone you love!
","I'll start by saying that I am usually taking my daughters to these animated films and have not been engaged in any of these until WALL-E. However, even with WALL-E- beyond the relationship of the two robots, the rest was done well but ... Anyway - UP was different. ******Lots of spoilers******** The film starts with Carl as a young boy, getting into mischief, meeting his wife - also very young. Still in the opening scenes, with essentially no dialog just images- we are taken through Carl's life and tender moments with his wife. It is truly moving, their love through difficult moments but mostly happy, together times. Then Carl is 78 years old - it is today - and he's alone. For me, half of the film was about Carl's fulfilling his promise to his wife, to make their home in a special, beautiful spot in South America: their special adventure. As Carl embarks upon this endeavor, he meets wonderful, endearing characters whose personalities shine with and without words. The way that Pixar weaves stories with so little words is incredible. The animation is wonderfully detailed and beautiful - you could see individual fur on the dogs, intricate feathers on the bird and stubble chin hair on Carl. The adventure has the usual villain but (for the adults), the second emphasis of the story is about Carl letting go of his loneliness and sadness after losing his wife and becoming engaged in life again. His wife had started a scrapbook when they met as children, about the greatest adventure she wanted to have in life - being the trip to South America. Carl always thought the pages after the 'Great stuff I want to do' in his wife's scrapbook was empty because they had never gotten to go to South America. At the end of the movie, he moves past that page to find that her scrapbook is filled with pictures of all the times they had together - that those were her best adventures. Amid all of the characters, comedy and activities which had the audience laughing and cheering, was the kind of love we all search for: enduring, fun, tender - and how hard it is to lose that love. You could feel Carl's sadness. Very moving, poignant - absolutely worth the tears. It will help you value your loves more while you have them. And the movie is filled with smiles too. The kids won't understand why there are tears in your eyes...",10,2,6,30 May 2009
Departures," Very sad look into Japanese culture
","Views into cultures that visitors cannot experience are fascinating. Quickly reading the description of the film from the DVD jacket - I thought it was going to about the cello player and his family. Wow - was I wrong. However, the film is an accurate view into the stoic, unemotional Japanese persona. This was a hard film to watch. The marriage of the main character, young, attractive, healthy - is unconnected. They barely touch. They talk in generalities about unimportant things and never about what each is feeling. As the main character begins his journey into a new line of work - after being laid off from the symphony - we see how the Japanese face funerals without shedding a tear, silent. The 'coffiners' are more human, treat the deceased with more love, tenderness than we ever see the live people show each other. This somehow gives the mourners permission to allow themselves to show their sadness, their tears. This is not an action movie - don't watch it if you are sleepy or want to vege out and be entertained. This movies will take attention and your thoughts will wander to your own or loved ones mortality/death. It does not have any scenes of violence or grossness - CSI shows way more of the dead bodies. It is not a 'happy' movie - it will generate conversations.",8,4,4,5 August 2012
The Secret Life of Pets," Previews looked funny - not for 90 minutes!
","I don't usually go to animated movies. I drop the kids off and pick them up but I love cats and the previews had a couple of interesting looking felines so I decided to stay for this one ... It had good moments but, overall, the movie was tedious. The cats were good and the hawk was very good. The dogs were sappy and their personalities seemed more boring than interesting. Dogs are supposed to have a special connection with their humans - the humans are in the movie so little, there's no time for a relationship to develop so it's really a romp of pets on their own. For kids, that's enough. Adults are looking for a little more of a connection to identify with. I did understand the message that most pets are left alone too long during the day and that pets have become disposable, discarded when no longer useful or convenient. But adults know that already. I don't think the message was strong enough for the kids. If you're an adult thinking that this might be a funny movie - it's not funny enough, not poignant enough, though the ending is nice.",3,3,23,9 July 2016
Looper," Lots of hype - very disappointing!
","We were really looking forward to this movie - most of Bruce Willis' movies are fun, exciting and tongue-in-cheek humor scattered throughout to make for great re-watching. There have not been many good sci-fi movies about time-travel and after reading the glowing reviews here (on IMDb), I even dragged my husband to this movie. He enjoys Bruce Willis movies but not scifi. This movie is at least 60 minutes too long. Bruce's role is well-played. His 'past' self is also well acted. It's all the stuff between that is an unbelievable, awkward time-travel/scifi story. For those of you who liked the 'Terminator' plot where it starts in the future, with Kyle looking at a picture of Sarah Conner that's taken in the past, at the end of the movie - closing the 'time' travel circle - Looper does nothing even close. Changing the future by altering the past is the typical time-travel story, done well in many movies, and unfortunately - done very badly in others. Looper is in the middle. While the stories being told in the past and future are interesting and well-acted/directed, the story linking the past-future is an 'eye roll' moment. In 'Looper', Bruce is not a good person, though he becomes one through the love of a woman. That should be the first clue to - oh brother - not one of those! So he tries to convince his 'past' self to change without figuring out what really needs to be changed to alter the future. It's so hokey in some parts that it's embarrassing. Like watching Bruce in 'Color of Night' or 'Hudson Hawk' - it's like - geez. Nothing about how the world is in the future is described except that a very bad guy is in charge and that's what needs to be changed in the past. Things keep happening at this diner in the middle of nowhere with no customers, black-and-white - and all the bad guys continue to meet up there. The people in the cities are living in the usual dark, cramped and lots of crime - future. How does this woman get a huge house, with electricity, out in the middle of a corn field - that theoretically - she is maintaining by herself? And why is she out there? None of that is explained. Maybe these are all metaphors - which are lost on me - I go to see an action movie not to try to figure out why the director shot a scene in black-and-white or why Bruce is running through a corn maze that's actually dead in the past. So - be fore-warned. This is not a 'Die Hard', not a 'Terminator', nor even 'Vanilla Sky'. It's OK if you go in not expecting much. It's got really hokey moments ala 'Knowing' and 'War of the Worlds remake'. And it's too long so you'll keep looking at your watching wondering how much longer can this movie drag on ...",3,21,42,10 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," Wow - blew me away!
","Let me start by saying this is not the kind of movie I generally watch. I'm all for the mindless action, occasional drama genre. So why did I even pick up this film? It was at the library, I looked at the actors and thought - OK. I didn't know anything about the film when I started watching it. I'll also share that I am not the type of viewer that concentrates on movies (on DVD). I multi-task - emails, etc. - while I 'watch'. Luckily, I also had 'subtitles on' (some parts are hard to understand).While the film was slow in getting started, there was something about the timeline stories that caught my interest. The characters are well- done and I wanted to find out what happened to them in the different 'times'. It was obvious right off that the characters move between timelines. This has been done before but never 6 at the same time. What was done exceptionally well was the way the movie built momentum as it neared the end - in ALL six timelines - frantically switching back and forth. So you're watching, waiting to find out what happens in your favorite timeline - you will have one or two - and things are happening fast and furious in all 6. My three favorites were 'Adam Ewing - the lawyer on the ship', 'Somni 451 and Hae-Joo Chang' in the future and the composer, Frobisher. Jim Sturgess was fantastic as were Doona Bae and Ben Whishaw. The sensitivity they brought to their characters was truly exceptional. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are not my favorite actors but were OK in their parts. The comic relief of Cavendish was done well but I have to admit, I had no idea how any of it worked into the timeline threads until I read about the story online and re-watched the movie. Yes - it's complicated, yes - it was not done as well as it could have been - but it has never been attempted before - to do 6 timelines, with actors moving between sets and locations like this. It was a remarkable feat of film-making and gave me a new appreciation for how difficult it must be keeping all that straight! I feel that the critics of this movie were expecting something simpler, more action- packed and more main-streamed. I usually do, too. However, there was something different about this movie that drew me in and made me want to know more about how it was made and the actual plot between timelines. It is not light watching and it's long, you'll probably want to watch it again. Turn subtitles on - it'll be easier to understand because of the pigeon English being spoken in the far future. I understand the film didn't do well when released. I hope it gets more acclaim in subsequent views because it deserves more accolades than it received. It will have you thinking about it for days after viewing.",9,6,9,8 February 2014
