The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Wonderful music, beautiful movie
","Such a beautiful movie! Acting of main character left me awe. Music is really classic.Is it really possible to exist and feel many things of one's life in more than one place or life? This movie makes people curious to find out about this.And its more damn attractive curiosity than passing time unproductively with aimless browsing. Thank God!, this movie was made!",9,0,0,30 November 2019
Rang De Basanti," This only Hindi movie is timeless to me
","This is timeless gem and I think this movie is one of those that changed South Asian film contents forever. The music, story, acting and everything is gem. This gem is the best of everyone who worked in this film may be. We should thank Om Prakash Mehra and Amir khan who was brave enough to work with this bravest content. They really changed the industry. Love you. Still now it is best Hindi movie that can raise sense of nationalism beyond the border.",10,0,0,15 December 2019
V for Vendetta," Was 'Joker' partially influenced by this movie?
","After watching this masterpiece, just this question arisen in my mind. Many things are seemed alike. This movie was hit, not blockbuster and not critically appreciated as Joker is. But this content is unique in it's time. Sometimes it seemed slow, but this film gave variations of feelings- anger, love, affection, revenge, justice and so on. There was a letter, written by a woman, that was emotionally spectacular. Classic lines. Such a good movie!",8,3,4,2 January 2020
