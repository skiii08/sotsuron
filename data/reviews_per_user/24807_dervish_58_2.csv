The Blair Witch Project," You people have no imagination
","Everybody keeps saying that nothing scary happened during the whole movive. Now, if you were lost in the woods, heard weird noises, and then saw odd bundles of sticks or stacked stones the next day, wouldn't YOU be a bit... worried?  Come on now.  The only problem I have with this (the only good big name horror movie since Bram Stoker's Dracula) is that the characters swear TOO much.  I'm all for endless profanity, but it just became annoying. Anyways, maybe you people would enjoy this movie better on some kind of hallucinogen, because you have NO imagination.  You probably didn't like Gummo either.  Sheep.",9,1,2,12 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Greatest movie ever made, of any kind
","Tolkien nuts:  CALM DOWN!!!  I love the book just as much as you guys, but come ON.  It won't be a perfect translation!!!  It would be about 40 hours long, so live with it.  Could YOU do better?  NO!  So CALM DOWN!!!  Look at it as its own entity, not just as a translation of the original.  That's like making the entire Bible into a movie and complaining if it isn't exactly perfect or complete!!!  If you look at it with that POV, you will realize that this stomps Citizen Kane, American Beauty, Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and so forth into the ground.  Nothing this grand and epic has ever been accomplished.  Whenever people try, they FAIL.This movie is simply beautiful.  I started The Hobbit in 5th grade (I'm 18 now), and read LotR itself in 8th, and ever since, I've been waiting for a movie to do it justice.  This was everything I could have ever wished for. I teared up at almost every scene to see the places of all our dreams and fantasies come alive.  The first shot showing a sizable portion of the Shire made me shudder with near orgasmic joy.  The only issue I had with it was Liv Tyler.  She wasn't even bad, I just don't like her.  Let's go through the rest of the cast, shall we? Frodo - perfect Galadriel - perfect Aragorn - perfect Boromir - perfect (wished he woulda had his horned helmet tho) the other hobbits - perfect Saruman - mind blowing!!!  Christopher Lee is the messiah, or I'm a goat Elrond - funny looking, but still great Gimli - perfect, tho he acted a bit like the dwarf from the D&D movie Legolas - second best piece of casting EVER Gandalf - BEST piece of casting ever EVERY OTHER BLOODY CHARACTER - SIMPLY PERFECT!!! I've seen a few times, and I hope to go at least 5 more times.  I just can't wait to see the Ents and Shelob.",10,2,2,21 January 2002
