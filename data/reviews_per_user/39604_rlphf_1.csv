The Lobster," god-awful
","Not going to write a lot here, as not much to say other than contains Boring robotic acting, flat zero-dimensional totally non-plausible characters which one can't care anything about, ridiculous boring pointless dialog, sexual scenes and language in gross and offensive way, pointless animal cruelty, disjointed ridiculous plodding overly long stupid plot.I've seen really boring movies, offensive movies, maddeningly stupid movies, really badly acted movies, movies with annoying, boring and vile characters. But I must admit this movie is a grand achievement in that it manages to combine all these characteristics into one truly stinky boring mess.IT would have wasted 2 hours of my life, had I not walked out. My vote was actually zero stars but scale only goes down to one. The critics who gave this 91% must be all in on black-comedy joke to see if they can sucker people into going along.",1,73,115,23 May 2016
