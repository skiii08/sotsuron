The Blair Witch Project," Wimp in 'too scared to visit the lavatory' shock.
","Like many people have said, the film is just too long: 45 - 60 minutes would've been just fine.  Plus, again like many people have said, the sheer amount of hype and comment detracts from the film, preparing you too well for what would otherwise have been a deeply unsettling experience. Nevertheless, it spooked me, and not just for the rest of the night, but into the bright sunny morning that followed.  Embarrassing to admit, but I didn't want to leave my room, except when nature was calling too loudly to ignore!Is it only me that detects the influence of MR James on the story?  As with James, we learn of the horrors from 'found' material: in James's stories it's usually diaries, or newspaper reports, or letters, or an overheard conversation, arranged and presented by a disinterested narrator; here, of course, it's the tapes and negatives unearthed long after the fact, the 'narrator' almost invisible except for the opening crawl (and for the fact that someone had to decide how the footage would be presented).  I'm not sure why this technique is so effective, unless it is simply the veneer of presenting facts, rather than creating a story.  The more obvious Jamesian influence is in leaving the precise nature of the horrors unexplained, but giving just enough information to leave you in no doubt that whatever is behind the phenomena is very nasty indeed.  Check out any James collection to see what I mean; 'A School Story', 'Count Magnus' and 'The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral' are perhaps the most typical examples.But do you want scary?  I mean REALLY scary?  Oh, I can give you scary.A couple of days after seeing the film, a friend of mine was talking to colleagues about it.  A lady in her twenties had also been to see it, with a group of friends.'Did you think it was scary?' asked my friend.'Oh yes,' she replied, 'it was terrifying.  I don't know how they got away with it.''Got away with what?''Showing those poor people dying like that''You're joking.''And the dead children, too.  They shouldn't have had the dead children on there.  I don't like that.''Tell me you're joking.''What do you mean?''You didn't really think it was real, do you?''Oh, it was.''It was not!''Yes it was.  My boyfriend was reading about it in the paper and they said it was real.'Actually, that's more depressing than frightening.",Null,0,1,30 October 1999
Spartacus," Stan Gets Lucky
","One of those movies which somehow seems to improve as it ages (probably because, between viewings, we forget how many cliches it avoids), Spartacus is a terrific film, and one which, I think, would have been every bit as terrific even if Mr Douglas and Mr Mann hadn't had that little falling out which led to Mr Kubrick getting the phone call.Don't get me wrong, I think Kubrick was a great director, perhaps even the best there has been, but not only had Spartacus been in pre-production for over a year by the time he was told to hop aboard, the actual shooting had already begun (that opening sequence in the quarry is all Mann's, I believe).  On a project of this scale, made in the heart of the Hollywood machine, even the most tyrannous director would be hard pressed to shape it into something that reflected himself, and indeed, some sources suggest Kubrick all but disowned the film.  He certainly wasn't involved with the '91 restoration.The only conclusion is that, whatever contribution he made scene-by-scene, the film's many overall qualities (witty dialogue, an emphasis on intrigue, a political theme, very handsome look) were there regardless of Kubrick, not because of him.",Null,4,7,30 August 2000
Fight Club," Length
","After an hour-and-a-half or so of 'Fight Club', things seemed to be drawing nicely to a close.  'How refreshing,' I thought, 'a contemporary big-budget movie that doesn't feel the need to prove its importance by dragging its unwilling bulk across the two-hour line.'  Then all of a sudden there was a plot development straight out of 'The Twilight Zone' and the ruddy thing went on another 45 minutes!  Hadn't been terribly impressed by it anyway.",Null,0,1,21 February 2000
Ghostbusters," The Difference an Audience Can Make...
","I saw this film on its first weekend in the UK, in Dec 1984.  Of course, it had already been a huge hit in the US, and the waves of enthusiasm had been lapping at our shore for months;  then there was that splendid theme tune which had been sat in the Top Twenty throughout late summer and the autumn, so by the time the pic finally arrived there was a tremendous amount of expectation.That Saturday night there were hundreds of filmgoers in the centre of Cardiff, but all to see the one film (I can still remember the deafening silence that greeted the cinema manager's enquiry, shouted down the length of that great queue, 'Is there ANYONE for 'Bachelor Party'?').  Lord knows how many were turned away, but those that made it in cheered as one when the lights dimmed.  Moments later, we were cheering again, whooping our appreciation of the library ghost's horrifying transformation, and then we were singing - well, shouting really -  along to the theme song, and this mood of festive celebration (it was Christmas, after all) was maintained throughout the next two hours, and it was one in which I joined as enthusiastically as anybody, despite a bladder which had been demanding urgent attention since even before the trailers had finished (and despite the slight disappointment of that giant doughman, which meant nothing to us in the UK), and long before the film's conclusion, I realised that I hadn't had so much fun on a cinema visit before, and nor have I had since.And when it had ended, and we had filed back out into the winter night (some of us via the gents), with each of our group almost taking turns to ask the rest if they had enjoyed the movie as much as he had, we began the ritual of recalling favorite moments from the film. But something odd happened. 'Remember that bit when...when...' When what? Hmm. Try again.  'How about when he said...when he said...'  Said what?  Did what? Hmmmm.Long before we'd reached home, we'd realised that the only highlights the film had were moments of spectacle, that there hadn't been any really good jokes, or plot twists, or weird little moments of invention; less than 30 minutes after leaving the cinema on that high, we'd realised that the movie had been thoroughly mediocre.A paradox, surely: how could we have enjoyed it so if it was a poor film? Simple: the audience made it fun; we'd acted like our own warm-up act.  We were there to enjoy ourselves and enjoy ourselves we did, all the film did was provide us with a few cues so we could keep the vibe up.  I said it is the most fun I've ever had at the cinema, and so it is: it's the same sort of fun I've had on a fairground ride when there's a load of people all screaming in mock terror - wouldn't be as good if you were alone, and so it is with 'Ghostbusters'; I've seen it since on TV, and it passes the time if you've absolutely nothing else to do, otherwise...Oh, and I saw the sequel in a cinema, but one that was nine-tenths empty. It didn't stand a chance.",Null,2,8,16 July 1999
