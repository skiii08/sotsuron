Alien 3," Oh dear, oh dear
","What happened here then.  It would be impossible to live up to the previous two, so why try.  If you throw a quarter up in the air and you shoot a perfect hole in the middle, why and try it again because your more then likely to fail.  Dark film that tries to be like the first in the saga, but doesnt pull it off like the master ridley.",5,302,315,22 January 2002
Alien: Resurrection," Disappointing
","I was really disappointed with this. The reason why Alien3 wasnt as great as it could have been was the restraints on Fincher. So what is the reason for this monstrosity, it kills the saga by making up some stupid way of bringing back Ripley. I preferred the original idea of making 4 after finding out that 3 was just a dream.",1,0,0,10 October 2002
Alien," Excellent, Horrific, Bloody good
","What a great film, when i was a child my dad said that this film was to scary to watch and that an alien burst through someones chest and it was bloody. Well at the age of 9 who was i to go against my dad. So a couple of years later i watched when i was about 13.  Back then i thought it was alright.  But now i that i am twenty the chest bursting scene is one of the best horror scenes in history.  A great film, especially the special edition with the cut 'Dallas' scene, which personally i thought should have been in the final cut.",9,0,1,22 January 2002
Aliens," What a film
","So here we have yet another great from Mr Cameron.  The fact that this film was made with limited 'Aliens', (just a few suits) was amazing and that it felt like you were surrounded by them.  Very atmospheric and it is one of my favourites of the saga.  Roll on Alien 5 and Alien vs Predator.",10,0,0,10 October 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Very fast and very furious and has a kicking soundtrack
","Film great.  Soundtrack is wicked.  I cant praise this film enough. Excellent stunts and cars to go mad over.  The chase scenes are some of the best i have ever seen and the races will completley blow everyone away, even if you dont like cars watch this film just for the rush and thrill of the ride.",8,0,1,3 September 2001
Scream," Horror and Craven at their best
","Wonderful, excellent, perfect. There are not enough words to describe how great this film is. Its highly original, its funny suspenseful and it scared the living hell out of me when i first saw it.  the following sequels didn't live up to the first masterpiece. Great film, great cast.",10,0,0,21 January 2002
