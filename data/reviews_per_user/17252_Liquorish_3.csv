Hereditary," Simply dreadful
",This is a retrospective review after realising the director of midsommar also did this. I will be avoiding this guys movies and anything else he does as if it had the clap. Why is he still making movies and who the hell is rating them highly!!!,1,5,16,13 October 2019
Midsommar," My first review
","Yes this movie drove me to write my first review. To justify a 1 star rating.
So this was...different, it succeeds at being unsettling and kind of original. Only, its in the same way a piece of amateur dramatic statement performance art would be if your mates in but didn't tell you the run time. You'll want to leave but feel you should watch to the end because hey it might get better. So after some extinction rebellion hard core take some mushrooms in a place where the sun always shines, the longest maypole dance scene performed outside of Scandinavia's got talent and Viking rituals kept for the worst of people being performed solely to provide chickens with a new climbing frame. I can say I thought movie did not live up to expectations.1 star to bring the meta down to a realistic rating don't watch it, or do and make you own mind up, it's your time!",1,24,41,13 October 2019
Mother!," The worst
","This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen the fountain and green lantern. I get it so it's not that, it's just weak and boring.",1,3,6,13 October 2019
