Hereditary," Toni Collette Outstanding Once Again!
","I wouldn't say Toni Collette is a particularly underrated actress but I don't think she always gets the credit she deserves. If you want to see a masterful actress at work then I definitely recommend this film.Hereditary is also shot beautifully with some really nice lighting and interesting camera movements. So the times where the movie is rather slow, you still feel engaged.My main problem with the film is the end, and without giving any spoilers, it seemed a little rushed and like it was giving us too much. Less is more with these kinds of film, and they followed that rule right until the last 15 minutes.",8,1,3,3 January 2019
