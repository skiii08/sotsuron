Blade Runner 2049," Nearly Perfect
","For me personally, the first two hours were amazing, I was completely immersed within the world and the story. Being a fan of the first one made me love the first two acts, and cringe a little at the third act, although, it certainly didn't ruin the movie for me, there were just a few things that kept the film being an absolute sequel masterpiece (Godfather 2, Aliens, Terminator 2, Mad Max Fury Road, etc.), that said, it comes pretty close, and who knows, I could change my mind after a few more viewings.Beware if you want to blank slate the movie, but read on if you've read most other reviews and synopses, or even just watched the trailers. But I'll start off with my complaints, so pretty much once Deckard entered the story, things started to go sour for me. First of all, the magic nostalgia is kind of ruined by the fact that this is Harrison Ford's third role reprisal, and the other two, lovable as they are, are comparatively silly. Deckard is a very, serious and dark character, to put it lightly, he and Rachael do not have a Han and Leigha romantic relationship, it's a very hard boiled noir type affair, let's just say Rachael never seems to happy, or even consenting, about the whole thing most of the time. They both have a lot going on. But in 2049, Harrison Ford reminisces about love and such, and seems more like Han Solo or Indiana Jones than Deckard, maybe that's just from the overshadowing of those two other characters. But it's just kind of weird, yes, Deckard and Rachael do run off at the end of the original, but the film is so dark, I doubt too much sweetness occurred, but who knows? They could have had a passionate year or so after.Also, the last climatic scene does not have the emotional punch of the original, also the presence of Harison Ford does not help. And lastly, the last scene is powerful, but very Arrival, and just kind of out of place, sort of like Harrison Ford actually. It's like if Mel Gibson was haniging out in Fury Road.That said, the rest of the film is amazing! Visually it replicates and improves upon the the aesthetic of the original. I very much like the way the story mirrors the noir mystery story line and pacing of the first, perhaps that's why the nostalgic last emotional hour seems a little out of place. Also, it was extremely refreshing to watch shots that were longer than seven seconds, to just let the world, and even the interiors, immerse you. The connection to the first are actually very clever, and Gosling's K's involvement in the whole thing is a nice nod to the vagueness of the original film. Contrary to many reviews and general rumor, the mysteries of the first are preserved. K's holographic HER girlfriend is a nice element, and a welcomed contrast to the original. Ana DE Armas turns what could have been just another empty character into the most fleshed out character of the film. Robin Wright, in a similar role as in Wonder Woman, is fun to watch as a great sergeant character.In summary, all in all, two hours of an absolute masterpiece, with a final act that is, well, a movie, but still a good movie, despite the minor complaints, hence the 9 rating, it was almost there.

Captain America: Civil War," Good, but suffers from being massively over-hyped
","Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed this movie, but it certainly did not live up to it's 90% ratings, which honestly just seem to be spite ratings toward the critically bashed Batman Vs. Superman, which was very similar in plot, similar is kind of an understatement, just with a different tone (campy, Wagnerianly epic, and just downright weird). I love the Marvel movies, but the formula is getting a bit weary. The Avengers is perhaps one of the most balanced and best, the original Captain America and Thor were completely fun homages to their source material, Ant Man was surprisingly unique and refreshingly fun. Age of Ultron was godawful and more deserving of 20% scores than BVS.The rest are good but fall into the sequel bin, this one is close to being bin material, but is saved by the most deservedly hyped element, the airport battle. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems like two hours of filler. I love the characters, so I enjoyed the ride, but because I know the characters so well, I kind of questioned everything and came up with a lot of pros and cons, I'm so torn on this one, I think a pros and cons list will do best. PROS As previously mentioned, the main hangar battle is perhaps the best superhero fight since The original Avengers. Amazing in IMAX. Ant man, is great, Paul Rudd lends a laid back spirit that the plot heavy character heavy movie desperately needs. Spider-Man is fun, but honestly, there's been so many Spider-Mans at this point, it seems a bit odd, but I do like how young he is, it's a new concept for film Spider-Man. The final battle is amazing but kind of underplayed, which leads me to my first and biggest CON The last epic battle between the two protagonists is not even in the IMAX format!??! It's like after the hangar battle (which is more like playful sparring), they just stopped giving a crap, I could have lived without the initial Africa James Bondsy intro action sequence in IMAX but I know they have to have their beginning IMAX sequence.But really, without the awe of the grand scale effect, the last battle left me wondering about the spotty details of the last reveal and the horrible lame ass unnecessary villain, which leads us to Zemo... wtf, so many ridiculous plot holes, google them if you're curious but wow... Just wow. Number one, his diabolical plan is exactly the same as the also underwhelming Lex Luther in BVS... Like framing a super hero for a blowing up a government building and all just to start a fight.... Honestly, for anyone who watches Agents Of Shield, you're sitting there wondering why the Avengers are farting around with each other when Hive is on the loose. Last Con The necessary but cringeworthy spillover from the god awful Age of Ultron. The Scarlet a Witch holds up well but Vision is just as stupid as he was before. Thank God only one embarrassed mention of the awkward Hulk/Black Widow romance is mentioned. Hawkeyes once again abandons his wife/girlfriend whatever with a bunch of kids out in the middle of nowhere to avenge something or rather while hanging out with his best friend, the Black Widow. And as with all Iron Man involved movies, the inevitable Robert Downey Jr. wannabe tear jerker I'm so concerned speech, eh, why couldn't the last scene have been in IMAX format... Tsk, tsk.",6,7,16,18 May 2016
