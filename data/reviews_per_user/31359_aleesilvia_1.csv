Walk the Line," Hugely disappointing... unreal and untruthful
","I have just finished reading Johnny Cash' autobiography and this movie has disappointed me to much that I wanted to stop it half way but my wife wanted to see the end and watching it was my idea, so I had to see the whole thing. It swings from being unrealistic to being in plain contradiction with the reality of events and character of people (first of all, his father, June Carter and his relationship with both) as Johnny Cash describes them. I honestly think it insults his memory by pretending to be biographical. This is not a biographical film by any means, it's a hollywood style romantic/soap opera kind of movie about an artist who had indeed a very interesting and unique life, just nothing to do with this movie.",1,3,7,15 April 2018
