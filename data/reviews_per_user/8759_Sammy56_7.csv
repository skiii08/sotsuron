Vertigo," Here we see that Hitchcock is sadist/master in movies..
","This man did many actors and actresses to make tedious and many unfriendly things. He was full sadist :)) but very genious movie director. Vertigo is one greatest thrill/horror/psychological movie ever made. When i watched this movie first time around 14 years old i didnt catch maybe half of the movies happening , so twisted and many layered this one is. It have to been watched with care, otherwise it wont open. It deservers 9/10",Null,4,5,21 June 2003
Alien," Masterpiece
","That whats it all about. This was luckily my first ever Ridley Scott movie i watched. And Alien saga is one of my favourites. At least 3 first movies. The fourth is more grim humour, but still watchable too.
But the Alien, it is one of the corner stones of Sci-fi/Horror mixing. I do like to watch movies like Star Trek, but even looking these side by side is not good idea. Alien have more the touch of reality in it , thats why it is very scary. Because its in human nature , we tend to be also in real life too eager to look , handle and control everything we see and find. And ofcourse, we dont learn very often about our mistakes.  Especially this first, and second Aliens movie is about betrayal and misconduction of superrority of humanrace. These are wider aspects but these are clearly seen in movie. Also i find it more realistic in Sci-fi by the shown sets in so called futuristic technology. In comparison, Star Trek is hole different world of unbelievable tech. bable. AND! in the end, the time when this movie was produced, it is remarkable work to do such quality in 1979. Its hard to believe but sets are more better made than many of todays computer effetcs in movies. I wonder how long it takes to make better Sci-fi/horror movies as this.",Null,0,1,3 April 2003
American Beauty," Not a masterpiece but..
","This is one way very dark comedy, but it too reassembles normal everyday life so that its giving many things to think about. Still i think in many coutries speaking of 'normal living' its day out of hand or knife fight in drunk, thats more acceptable as normal what happens, than if you have on same street living gayÂ´s fake familys and military patriots. So, this movie won 5 oscars but infact its more not like it says it is. I discribe this movie is like man and woman glued together,very same but still millions miles away from themselves and added the whole life and all other peoples there too. There are some universal thigns it raises but many i dont see so familiar. But hey, after all its American beauty. ;-)) Worth of watching I give it 7/10",7,0,0,21 June 2003
Alien vs. Predator," All in all this is so moderate hack'n slash.
","So, i have too watched these movies of the 2 species , and have read Alien and Predator comics, before this. First i would hoped that Paul W.S Anderson must stayed to direct the second Resident Evil, not this. I think that all directors, especially in all Alien movies have had more deep aspect of character development, and background of the story have been better. If i consider purely of these Alien and Predator movies, the all other movies than AVP has more believable science fiction elements that are all other than action related,and this one has too much pointless action, and that is just like i mentioned because of director. I have seen it already in earlier Anderson's movies, directors make of course their own look a like movies . But in case of these 2 scifi movie monsters and Anderson they come along like red stain in white car. That makes this movie to be allround worse than all its predecessors . I cannot understand why they didn't find better director for it.The second serious problem is that this should have been much longer. Many things don't make sense if you stuck much action , almost nothing more and thats it. This shows that joining of two movie groups is not so good result it can be, not even near. Storyline of predecessor movies is already so huge. There is wery much background that have not noticed. The whole story would been better against action. Now its like pancake.In good side is effects. Though, these develop all the time. It was not surprise as there were skilled persons, making the effects , witch have been much in all movies making these monsters to work.Like i stated in start , this movie is moderate. It means it is watching worth. But not even near as any other alien or predator, so don't get big expectationsIl give it 5 out 10",Null,0,0,27 August 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," Masterpiece Thriller
","I think there is not much to say, all who like thrillers know this one. This is just so brilliant movie, Brilliant Thriller, more of the mind than action. With spot on cast for this kind of movie, especially the chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster is great. And Jodie Foster was perfect choise in her role,as she is known to be very clever/genius and gifted, and was known this in her childhood.Very good example how good movie can be made around few things, if people doing it are the right one. Last line is of course for great Director who made this all possible.I hope there would be more like this, but todays lines in Hollywood is not giving much a chance for that , its a shame.",10,5,11,3 September 2005
Cube," I , You , We, They....
","Cube is not movie for straight action phased sci-fi fans. Here is not Aliens to blow away , not invaders. Only the mind is important. This movie rely on people who is thinking deeper than average Hollywood directors and actors. So there can be undoubt two category of people , others like this movie , the other half doesnt. In critical i dont see any big flaws in the cast of this movie, as we need also other acting than super stars. This movies strenghts are in psychological side. Its effects are fair. But the ending is not so good . Still i rate this on 8",Null,0,1,2 April 2003
Alien: Covenant," Alien Covenant is Something old mixed with Something New..
","This movie is Gruesome in its own right. Where the real monster or sunken into madness, is the Android David.The feel of this flick is somehow confusing or mixed. Because touches are noted into Alien but much other similarities there is not. If not consider typical things to this movie franchise. Anyway it has some good moments, like when Daniels is watching the design prints about Alien creatures and Dr Shaw. It reminds very much Giger like Art.Characters are OK. But would be more deeply illustrated. Monsters are nice, i mean not nice but fits perfectly to his product. I'm giving this movie 7 of 10 But the reviews aspect of Rating, would differ some depending what part or thing it is considered to aim at.In the end. The Alien Covenant is fair continuity to this movie series. And as I'm realist. Lets face it. Its just Entertainment, and no one of us or very few would not know whats the road these Movie series are traveling in first place.Or in the heads of the makers who planned the stories behind these. So, not taking it too seriously. But its not rubbish by any standards.",7,36,65,28 May 2017
