The Blair Witch Project," this is all a load of bull****
","this is the most pathetic excuse for a film... ever. download it illegally online so you don't give these nerds any more money and watch how terrible it is. Americans are dumb enough to think this crap really happened. it's so obviously fake. go to the website and you read, and i quote, 'Montgomery College film students Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard, and Heather Donahue less than a week before their disappearance.' they didn't disappear! they probably just changed they're names before the movie came out just to spook people out. to think this is the highest profiting film of all time is astounding. oi vey (i'm not even Jewish.) anyway, this is a terrible film. never watch it unless you would otherwise die, and even if that were the case, think over which one you would choose first.",1,2,6,21 June 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," along with volume 2, the best movie i've probably ever seen!
","this movie is flippin' awesome. uma thurman is like the best actress on the planet and it. shows. quentin Tarantino is the best director on earth by far (he directed Pulp Fiction, for goodness sake!). the fight sequences are so incredibly worked out and the way he uses the black and white to make it less gory is so cool. beatrix goes and tries to kill all the members of the D.I.V.A.S. (of which she was a former member) and most of all their leader, Bill, because he impregnated her and tried to kill her. the script is so well written and the story of the second one is even better (check out my review of vol. 2). i read that they had to break it up into two movies because the film company couldn't put a 3hr 15min flick on the market, but volume one has so much action and incredible acting. i don't know why it wasn't up for more awards!",10,0,3,18 March 2006
