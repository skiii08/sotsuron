The Ring," The audience laughed alot. Original is far better.
","Just watch the Japanese version, that's an amazing film, the US one is okishygood. Well worth going to the trouble of seeing the Japanese version instead, far scarier etc. Oh surprisingly the Japanese one has got real actors, as oppose the laughable acting in this one(yeh people in the cinema laughed at it). Japanese also develops the storyline better and more fully, and it will make more sense. Compare it to a fighting scene, e.g. US film is just another fighting scene(steven segal type thing), the Jap is the new matrix style, slo mo etc, fighting scene,  they both show a fight but matrix style is more enjoyable to watch and makes the character seem more skillful.Spoilers First it starts off with crappy acting. The girl did not look scary, Japanese girl made you scared. Some scenes were just a complete waste, added nothing really to the story, while leaving out big parts of the story which would have given the viewer a much better understanding. I didn't sense any sort of desperation, when her time was running out, or desperation for her child. That boy annoyed the hell out of me, basically 6th sense child. The scene where she comes out of the TV, nope didn't really do it for me, I preferred the(I'll let you finish the sentence).",5,0,1,28 February 2003
