10 Cloverfield Lane," A great movie till the final 10 minutes...
","OK, I am exactly in the same situation as the user 's-thepatel'. It's funny but it's my first movie comment ever as well. I am going to be honest. It has great acting, it stress you by giving the confinement feeling at all time, and the 'What the hell is really happening here?' and I assume it must have been a cheap movie to make (I mean three actors, 3 or 4 rooms, 2 cars, and a little CGI, economically it must have been perfect).BUT... At the end... I mean, SERIOUSLY??? YOU KILL AN ALIEN SHIP WITH A MOLOTOV BOMB?? AND THEN YOU DECIDE TO JOIN THE ARMY BECAUSE, HEY IF YOU KILLED A SHIP WITH A BOTTLE IMAGINE WHAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITH A GUN... Really, I felt frustrated and cheated.Sometimes it is better to watch a bad movie, that you know is crap from the beginning and then you can relax and enjoy not hoping too much, and not that kind of movie that you start watching excited, and with great expectations, and then ends like it was a joke...I can't either understand why it has so SO MANY good reviews. But of course, reviews are a subjective matter, so my vote is 1 (because there is no 0 unfortunately)Thank you everybody. Regards.PS: by the way, I am sure Howard must have had the Breaking Bad DVD Special Edition among his collection... I mean, perchloric acid in a barrel, that dissolves any kind of organic matter... Rings some bells huh?",1,6,12,5 June 2016
