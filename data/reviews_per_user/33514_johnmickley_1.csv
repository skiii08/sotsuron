Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Incredible!
","I would recommend this movie for anyone who has ever seen 'da ali g show.' I would also recommend this movie for anyone who has a sense of humor. Sacha Cohen completely demolishes the typical framework of Hollywood cinema with this hilarious film. I saw it at a special screening and it the entire audience cracked up.I understand that Cohen has come under much fire for his 'Borat' character, including being sued by the country of Kazakhstan. After seeing this movie I am still completely in awe of his ability to look a random person in the face and say 'Gypsy you must give me your tears.' I don't want to say much else about the movie, because it is too funny to give away any of the jokes. All i can say is: if you don't like this movie, you don't have a soul.",10,8,26,26 September 2006
