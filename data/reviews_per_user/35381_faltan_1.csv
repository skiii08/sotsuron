The New World," great disappointment!
","Despite great landscapes, the entire film passes between sheepish looks of Pocahontas and Smith (and later with the guy who will be her husband).the film is needlessly long, esp. at the second half forced myself to stay till the end. this should be the easiest role for all, because there are very little conversations, just foolish looks at each other's eyes. and about john savage, where did the great artist of the 'deerhunter' go? just 10 seconds of role. was expecting something like 1492 'the conquest of paradise' before going to the film, but now I'm sure it's waste of time and money! Was a great disappointment for me for my one of favourite actors, colin farrell, also.",3,1,5,7 March 2006
