Your Name.," I wasn't interested anymore on anime but changed after this
","I was curious of the high rating of this movie so I watched even this was an anime, although I'm anime fan before so I still watched. I didn't expect there's a movie this great, just in the beginning of the movie it was very entertaining, very unique and very funny. hahaha! I thought that this might be better if done by real actors and actresses, but I this this (anime) would be better, I have seen many anime movies that make a live-action but didn't work, so this is totally fine. No movies to watch? You'd better try this if your not allergic to anime. Unbelievable story, very unique, somehow mind-blowing and you'll fall to the movie. And the animation, the details, the graphics on the background, really great. The creator of the movie is very good.",10,0,0,15 May 2020
