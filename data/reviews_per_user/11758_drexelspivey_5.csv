Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat Great Success!
","'Borat!: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' Brian Murphy-Evanston RoundTable. Sacha Baron Cohen, the London-born, Cambridge--educated comedian responsible for the brazenly funny 'Da Ali G Show,' has made a career embodying clueless characters. His trio of journalist incarnations, including hip-hop wannabe Ali G, flamboyantly gay fashion correspondent Bruno, and naïve, Kazak reporter Borat Sagdiyev, through their shockingly candid questions and bizarre behavior, rile the tempers and wrest the unholy truths from their unwitting subjects. With 'Borat!..,' Cohen has created the funniest, creatively offensive film of the year, and the most intelligent 'dumb' film since 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.' The film blends the line between reality and fiction, documentary and scripted action. While Cohen's guerilla-style interviews remain intact, they are weaved together by a fictional story involving the Kazak government sending Borat and his television producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davatian) on a trip to the United States to learn from the superpower.Kazakhstan is presented in the film as a depressed, backwards country, which led to calls for boycotts from its citizens and the government. After watching the first five minutes of the film, it is easy to see why the moderate, western-leaning country had issues with Cohen's characterizations.We are first introduced to Borat in his small village, preparing to depart for America. He speaks with affection concerning his town while pointing out its problems. Along the way, we meet his sneering neighbor, mother, ill-tempered wife, and after the two engage in a deep kiss, his sister. He introduces us to local Kazak ceremonies, such as 'The Running of the Jew 2004' (an event fabricated by the Jewish Cohen for satirical purposes), which is as funny as it is intentionally offensive.The film takes off when Borat and Azamat reach America, traveling the country in an ice cream truck, a live bear riding shotgun (seriously), seeking advice from true Americans on their way to Los Angeles. Borat, having fallen in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing an episode of 'Baywatch' in his hotel room, hopes to marry the star and bring her back to Kazakhstan.Without giving away any of the gags, Borat terrorizes (with irony, not WMD's, mind you) a humor coach, a driving instructor, rodeo attendants, elitist guests at a dinner party, mortgage brokers at a hotel conference, security guards, and pretty much any one he tries to greet by giving a kiss on the cheek. Inconceivably, Pamela Anderson makes an uncredited cameo at the film's end, and whether the conclusion was real or staged remains to be seen (I vote for the latter).Despite his sexism, bigotry and anti-Semitism, when put up against Americans who are not in on the joke, Borat miraculously escapes as a sympathetic character. His ignorance is played by Cohen as an almost childlike innocence, and his joyful exuberance is infectious. Furthermore, we realize Borat's idiocy is an act. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the disturbing array of homophobic southerners, racist Americans and misogynistic frat boys he meets along the way.Doubters of Cohen's relevance can look to Cannes, among the dozens of other prestigious film festivals, who have championed the film at first screening. Doubters of Cohen's talents and/or dedication to his craft can look to his talk show promotions and film screenings, both of which Cohen has refused to attend other than in full-on Borat method mode. He is like Andy Kaufman with a punch line. And, much like the legendary comedian, he refuses to pull punches, infuriating those he involves for our amusement.",9,3,11,7 November 2006
The Prestige," The Intrigue of 'The Prestige'
","'The Prestige' by Brian Murphy'The Prestige,' a Victorian-era set film about dueling magicians, is much darker than 'The Illusionist,' the recently released magician film starring Ed Norton. It is a startling, sometimes violent study of rivalry, jealousy and obsession. Deftly directed and sharply written (along with his brother Jonathan Nolan) by Christopher Nolan ('Memento,' 'Batman Begins'), the story follows the lives of friends-turned-rivals Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Their unrelenting quest to be the best has profound effects on their entire adult life. 'The Prestige' hooks us right away, with an intriguing shot of a hill littered with top hats. Without explanation, the multi-narrated film begins its first voice over as trick contraption designer Cutter (Michael Caine, terrific again) describes the three stages of a magic trick: The pledge, the turn and the prestige. The devious Nolan brothers have crafted their story to play out with a magic trick, setting out to trick us at the film's end. Despite some meandering scenes and revenge plots that may eventually seem repetitive, when the final surprise is finally sprung, the effect is chilling, whether we have guessed the outcome correctly or not. Narrative structure is bent, as past, present and future become a multi-layered collage that Christopher Nolan expresses with stunning clarity. Whatever points in Robert's or Alfred's lives are given screen time are distinguished with ease, whereas a lesser director would have muddled them. Robert and Alfred, apprentices working for the same magician. Despite a cordial rapport, both seem to have different ideas about what makes a good magic trick, with Alfred always seeming to have the idea of pushing things further. After ignoring Cutter's advice for how to tie a knot proper for Magician Assistant Julia, the woman dies in a water tank, and Alfred is responsible. Julia was Robert's wife, thus spawning the heated, perhaps even murderous rivalry that is to comprise the rest of the film. The Nolan Brothers have done their research, dissecting several, intricate magic tricks and revealing them to the audience. From the 'Bullet Catch' to the 'Disappearing Man,' all angles are dispelled, and Robert and Alfred stop at nothing to sabotage their enemy from completing either trick. Even the bit players offer some spice, such as Scarlett Johansson as Robert's assistant Olivia, who may or may not be playing one side against the other. Rebecca Hall is outstanding as Alfred's wife, Sarah, her performance reminiscent of some of the outstanding, tough performances given by many of the women on HBO's 'Deadwood.' Sarah's feelings towards Alfred begin with intrigue, melt into love, and almost slip into madness trying to understand Alfred's split personalities-loving husband one day, obsessed magician the next. The lines in this film are as shadowy as Wally Pfister's cinematography, where our allegiance is deliberately forced to shift from one magician to the next, a testament to both good writing, and to the outstanding performances of Mr. Bale and Mr. Jackman. Both characters are, at times, valiant heroes and vile villains. Like 'Memento,' picking apart the plot of 'The Prestige' may uncover some holes, but the overall effect is an exhilarating whirlwind of mystery, suspense and shocking revelations that are bound to have audience members discussing motives and theories long after the credits have stopped rolling.",9,2,3,30 October 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Brilliant fairy tale not for kids
","'Pan's Labyrinth' 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a fairy tale film for adults, an astounding visual feast that is as gorgeous as it is gory. Do not be deceived by the fairies, castles and the presence of a little girl as the main protagonist, graphic violence is everywhere, from scenes of war, grizzly torture (though, to be honest, probably not much worse than what is shown on '24') and genuinely frightening fantasy moments.Having done my duty for the MPAA, I am now compelled to discuss the devastating brilliance of writer/director Guillermo del Toro's film ('El Laberinto del Fauno,' in Spanish). Known for his work on acclaimed horror/fantasy films ('Cronos,' 'Hellboy'), del Toro uses 'Pan's Labyrinth' to examine the effects on a child living in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, a conflict and concept he has alluded to before, in 'The Devil's Backbone.' Like M. Night Shyamalan, Mr. del Toro has a gift for extracting emotional depth from young performers, and Ivana Baquero's turn as little Ofelia is no exception. We meet her on a journey through the woods, traveling with her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) on their way to her new father's estate (Sergi Lopez as army Capitan Vidal).Still suffering from the trauma of her biological father's death, and the fear of her new home and father, Ofelia has found escape in books. However, when she uncovers an insect that turns into a fairy, del Toro and his visual effects crew will leave you blinking in amazement. Ofelia is lead to a labyrinth of rocks behind Capitan Vidal's estate, where she embarks on a quest that will, hopefully, lead her to a castle where she will become a princess.While Capitan Vidal hunts down and tortures rebels hiding in the woods, and her mother battles a difficult pregnancy, Ofelia is left to complete tasks designed by a faun named Pan. The story never grants us the knowledge of whether or not Ofelia's creatures and tasks are real, so we are left to infer as to their validity.The omnipresent gloom of war leads to a vital plot shift involving rebels and Capitan Vidal's servant, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu in an outstanding performance), who has become a surrogate mother to Ofelia while also secretly helping the rebels. We see the horror of Capitan Vidal's violence, and the depths of his black soul. Sergi Lopez's performance is powerfully chilling.Ofelia's tasks take her to mystical places, from the inside of a large tree to uncover a key hidden in a toad's belly, to a frightening encounter with a child eating creature with eyes on his hands. Mr. del Toro's vision is laudably brought to life through stunning audio and visual effects, intricate set pieces and brilliantly constructed costumes.The tragedies mount for poor Ofelia as her quest goes astray, and Capitan Vidal's rage becomes increasingly uncontrolled as the film nears a brutal conclusion.Wisely, the film grants us the freedom to draw our own conclusions at the end. Those hardened by the harsh cruelties of human nature may be saddened, but those who still hope for a better world will leave the theater believing in magic.",9,2,4,9 January 2007
28 Weeks Later," Tense, explosive sequel more 'Aliens' than 'Excorsist 2'
","'28 Weeks Later' A film review by Brian Murphy With a prime-time budget, a new director, and sans original star Cillian Murphy, '28 Weeks Later,' the sequel to the indie smash '28 Days Later,' seeks to one-up its predecessor. Shockingly, it succeeds.'Weeks' director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo maintains the look of the original's British, neo-zombie film 'Days' and director Danny Boyle's style through stark, washed out cinematography, and hyper-realist, docudrama visuals created by the use of jittery, hand-held cameras.The sequel also benefits from a more involving story, an intelligent critique of the military (primarily the U.S. military), a seemingly endless horde of zombie extras and more money to spend on CGI effects and explosions.Not much time elapses before the film launches its first, frightening, hyper attack. After a recent outbreak of a 'rage virus' in London and its surrounding areas, carriers, who are eager to beat and bite common citizens, are infecting the inhabitants at an exponential rate.Barricading themselves in a country house, a small group of survivors, including a married couple played by Catherine McCormack and Robert Carlyle (who starred in Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting'). After initially defending his wife from a gang of invading zombies, Don (Carlyle) leaves her for dead, escaping by a boat as she stares out a window in disbelief as he runs away. How's that for a complicated protagonist? Fast-forward roughly 28 weeks later to a U.S.-led, U.N.-coordinated reconstruction of London, after the contained zombies have starved to death. Within the protected 'green zone'(sound familiar?), snipers peep into local high rises, scientists probe returning citizens, and Don's children, Tammy (penetrating-eyed Imogen Poots) and Andy (the 'Harry Potter' sounding Mackintosh Muggleton) come home to their father and a strange new militaristic world.Danny Boyle had creatively, tightly shot a city seemingly devoid of life, but Mr. Fresnadillo takes it a step further, by having either shut down several blocks of London at a time, or by having employed the mass use of CGI. Either way, his endless high-angle long shots of downtown London depict mass areas bereft of life. The experience then, of these returning citizens, is like the discovery of a new world.Don's lies to his children concerning the 'death' of their mother are soon rebuked after his children escape the green zone to return to their house to gather their belongings. The military captures them, along with their still living but infected mother. Her body's rejection of the virus garners the attention of compassionate military doctor, Scarlet (Rose Byrne of 'The Dead Girl'), who makes every effort to protect the mother and her children.When an anguished Don sneaks in to apologize to his wife, things, as they tend to do in horror films, go very, very wrong.In this film, chaos and terror go hand in hand, and both are effectively generated in an instant. The deterioration of the military complex takes mere minutes of screen time. The outbreak abruptly erupts, and the soldiers turn from protectors to murderers in the blink of a an eye.The guitar-heavy, electro-tinged score effectively frays our nerves to further heighten the tension of an inherently tense movie.Poots and Muggleton are fine young actors who convincingly portray a brother and sister looking to protect one another from the ensuing chaos. The script allows ample time for the two to form a palpable, on-screen bond while the pair dodges both zombies and military personnel.Disregard the dodgy ending, it was clearly created solely to set up a sequel, and you've got yourself a taut, well-acted and well thought out horror film, comparable to Romero's 'Land of the Dead.'",8,2,5,25 August 2007
The Fountain," With death breathes life
","'The Fountain' A film review by Brian Murphy Evanston RoundTableI am unaware as to whether or not Darren Aronofsky has obsessive-compulsive disorder, but the characters and themes in his films certainly reflect this trait. The brilliant writer/director has explored the disturbing obsession of a mathematical genius ('Pi'), the horrifying compulsions of drug addicts ('Requiem for a Dream') and now the ceaseless quest of man who, during the course of a thousand years, seeks a cure for death so he can be with his loved one forever. With 'The Fountain,' Mr. Aronofsky has created a stunning visual and thematic tapestry. Three separate yet interconnecting stories and time-lines are expressed with such skill that they become one ongoing saga. Hugh Jackman ('The Illusionist') and Oscar winner Rachel Weisz ('The Constant Gardener') play two star-crossed lovers torn apart by death. Mr. Jackman is a volcano of erupting emotion, while Ms. Weisz is almost Zen-like in her dual, terminal roles. Both are exceptional in their performances. In Spain, 1500 A.D., Weisz is Isabel, a Queen desperately trying to survive the Spanish Inquisition. As a last resort, she sends her loyal Conquistador, Tomas (Jackman), to 'New Spain' (Guatemala) on a quest to find the Mayan-protected Tree of Life, the same one referred to in Genesis that gives eternal life. She gives him a ring and makes him promise to return so that they can rule and live together forever. In America, 2000 A.D., Jackman is Tom Creo, a doctor whose cancer treatment experiments are vastly improved when he uses a root found in Guatemala to cure lab monkey Donovan's brain tumor. His obsession to find a cure as quickly as possible spreads as wife Izzi's (Weisz) health begins to rapidly deteriorate from her own brain tumor. Forgoing his chance to spend time with his beloved during her last days, Tom chooses to try and conquer death, instead. In outer space, 2500 A.D., Tommy (you guessed it-Jackman) floats and meditates in a nebula, finally reaching the snow globe-like orb that contains the tree of life, greeting welcome memories of Izzi/Isabel, and desperately fighting off bad memories, like his failed promise, or even more disheartening to Tommy- listening to Izzi try to explain things like death leads to creation, death will bring them together, or that she is no longer afraid of dying. To Tommy, by definition, the only way to be immortal is to live forever. To separate the three tales, as I have just done, does the film a grave injustice. It is Aronofsky's artful direction that blends this tale into a fascinating work. His use of symbolism not only recalls archetypes (dagger and pen), but is also used as a bridge between stories and time-lines. Perhaps the painting in present day Tom's home, of a Mayan temple that just happens to be the same one he entered, as a Conquistador, comes off more as a wink than an epiphany, but fans of a certain auteur (and Aronofsky has earned the right to garner that title) often indulge the artist, such as Hitchcock making cameos in so many of his films. He forever bathes the mise en scene in gold-both objects and lighting-creating a warm and ethereal tone. Implausibly, the film may somehow manage to peak the interests of both a religious and an existentialist audience. The topic of death and the afterlife (or lack thereof) sets off an engaging quandary for our characters to either accept or conquer. Will it lead them to the same place?",9,1,3,6 December 2006
