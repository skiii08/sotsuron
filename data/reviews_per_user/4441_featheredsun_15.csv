Black Swan," Fascinating and Visceral
","This film is a journey into the dark territory of change.To transcend herself, a girl of innocence must realize that her skill is not enough, must navigate the spined halls of neurosis and conflict, must accept the stark beauty of aggression, and must embrace the glory of pure selfish power.But it is only after fully understanding the inevitable cost and the sacrifices made, that she may come full circle and achieve the grace of tragic beauty and find true perfection, which is impossible to survive.Graceful, moving, and laced with vital turmoil......la danse magnifique.",8,1,4,26 June 2011
Gravity," Gorgeous Peril at Every Turn
","Gravity is a fast-paced flight through stunning beauty and danger.CONS The movie seems short and there's not much time to really learn about the characters. PROS This film is very impressive on three main fronts: visual imagery, technical detail, and seat-grabbing action.The scenes of Earth from orbit are absolutely breathtaking. Space is also beautiful in itself - the silence of it, the empty reaches between objects - it's perfect nothing. The brilliant cinematography and cgi mastery really take us there. I really am in envy of those who have seen it for real if just some movie footage can capture such beauty.And no detail is spared. The EV suits, the Hubble telescope, other satellite components, the space-shuttle, space-stations, and re-entry vehicles. All are rendered with care and loving attention. If you watched this movie 100 times, you probably still wouldn't notice all the tiny parts and pieces. Space-flight does not happen by magic, and the film-makers really want us to see how much ingenuity and craft has gone into letting us float above our world. When some of these parts and pieces get away from us, though, that's when things get dangerous. And there's no deadlier place for this than the airless frozen void of space. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that I've never seen destruction that felt so close and immediately threatening. I was on the edge of my seat grabbing at anything I could for fear of the character(s) losing grip and tumbling off into the forever...or worse. So, suit up and grab on - this is one hell of a ride.",7,0,3,29 December 2013
127 Hours," Don't Avoid This Movie!
","I had put off watching this film for a while after getting it, thinking it would be an ordeal and possibly boring - I mean how exciting can watching a guy stuck for almost 5 days be? I was very pleasantly wrong.The movie's pacing is spot on. It pumps you up with a beautiful vitality and exhilaration to where you're having a great time being with actor James Franco and loving his (Aron Ralston's) life as a vigorous adventurer in the wild. And then the accident happens, and you're so right there with him, unbelieving and struck with shock.And it's impossible not to hang in there though all the trial and horror of what follows.Danny Boyle and his team really do well with this movie, artistically, diving into the experience of a man trying to survive, to get free, and into the depths of the soul that stare back when we have no refuge, literally CAUGHT between life and death. Even with the depths of delerium, where reality blurs, this film is never too arty or pretentious.See this movie now, rather than later. It's a hell of a ride.",9,0,1,18 March 2011
Brokeback Mountain," A Moving Film About Love and Regret
","This movie is beautiful. It paints a nuanced and heady landscape of fear, love, social unease, anger, and most of all - the pain of knowing that you could have had something wonderful and you didn't step up and own it.You can see some parallels b/w the story of Jack and Ennis and Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien in another of Ang Lee's understated love stories, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In both films we see two people who are drawn together by a deep soul-felt bond of love, but hesitant to embrace it fully because of the societal constraints they follow.You can approve or disapprove with the characters' choices in life, and this film shows you plenty of reasons for either. Both men are married and have families and we see the pain, especially in Ennis' case of how infidelity hurts all around it including the men responsible. But though you may judge, you still feel the strength of the bond between these two men...feel the sense of pure freedom the mountain gives them. It transcends many things.The acting, all round, is superb. The cinematography is open, bare, and grand. The story paced perfectly.A great, sad, moving film that will move anyone...ANYONE...who has felt soulful longing and love that for whatever reason was never given a real shot. Whatever your 'orientation,' whatever your beliefs, you should still see this as it WILL move you...and echo in you the way great art always does.",8,5,5,29 March 2011
Deadpool 2," A Charming Comedy Superflick
","CONS
Some of the acting is terrible. 
Some of the earlier fight action is clunky.
There's a bit of drift where the comedy meets the drama.
Hitler survives.PROS
Deadpool and Ryan Reynolds are just charming as f---.
There's some really great fight action in the later part of the film.
The movie is unafraid to make some pretty amazing comedy moments.
The J word.So, maybe it's not as fresh as the first one was, but it's still got an adventurous spirit, and there's a good bit of thought put into both the comedy and the drama - enough to make both work, together and independently.Definitely worth seeing.",7,0,1,7 September 2018
The Hateful Eight," Theatric and Detailed
","This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama - all artfully melded together by a seasoned crew and talented actors.The action is set in antebellum Wyoming, in the heart of a raging blizzard, in a frontier bar. Setting is very important here.The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. Feelings about the American civil war are very up-front, with complicit atrocity present in nearly all the characters. The war brought out horrible things in these people, and we see how they deal with that shared knowledge, both personally and to each other.The blizzard provides the necessary isolation to the story. These characters are stuck with each other, and this forced closeness is central to the story - they're all Hateful, and that hate reverberates among them, destroying peace and hope. Hate is what brings them together and hate is what tears them apart. The blizzard also provides some interesting incidental elements that are fascinating to watch, like the hardship of a simple task like preparing guidelines, or going to the outhouse, and the cold hell explodes inward at times (when the door is opened) with punctuating effect, providing some breaks to the narrative, and even some needed laughs.And the bar... This film's action takes place primarily in one large room. It feels very much like a stage play (as another reviewer mentioned), allowing greater intimacy with the characters and their interactions, while providing us with an opportunity to witness multiple scenarios unfolding at the same time. This density of action is very cool. We are afforded third person omniscience without losing connection with the motives and perspectives of the players.And the stage setting meshes very integrally with the acting. We see the principal actors doing top-notch with not only their primary motivational actions, but nearly every choice in blocking and busy action. The director and production team make a very wise choice in showing the small little details of what's going on here. Attention is paid to realistic procedural actions, and reactions, for these details. The result is that we see characters behaving in reasonable ways to their environments, pausing to disarm a stranger, or undo a shackle, not simply because the plot calls for it, but because it's a reasonable choice that they would make at the time. Very refreshing to see, actually.On the negative side, Tarrantino's choice to use narration was weakly executed. I don't know if there would have been a way to do this without narration, but the actual usage detracted from the ongoing story. Also, there were a few points in the action where the characters seemed to be a little too accepting of the events that transpire around them. This is purely a fault of direction/writing.But overall, a very watchable film, that is notably unafraid to portray some very dirty and uncomfortable bits of the human psyche. Some folks seem to have an issue with this last part. My advice to them is to loosen up a bit and accept art that hurts a little. That's one of the things good art can do.",8,77,127,30 January 2016
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A Beautifully Textured Masterwork
","This is a really amazing film. All the pieces - props, costume, camera-work, script, and acting - fit together as well as the finely crafted parts of a nickel-plated revolver. I was surprised I'd not heard more about it.The film tells the story of the James Gang and specifically the fatal relationship of Jesse James and Robert Ford. During the course of the action we see darkness and light in everyone, even the 'coward.' Care is taken to finely pare into the psyches of these Outlaws and the cold world they walk in. I think I saw just about every emotion there is to have in these men and we can almost understand, even if we can't accept, what moves them in their deadly paths.Pitt is both iconic and vulnerable - beautiful and frightening as Jesse James, a robber and killer who hoists up a reputation of fearless boss on one shoulder and charming folk hero on another. His character's movement through peril and praise reminds one of the great gangster characters from Scorsese's work, with an added rawness that only Pitt and a few others can genuinely summon. His fatalism is also quite entrancing and subtly masterful.Affleck is truly mesmerizing as a born misfit who is so uncomfortable in this world around him, that his neuroses, if they can be called that, really get into your skin. I was reminded of Joaquin Phoenix's role as Comodus, but it's even more intense and yet so very believable. As the audience, I was torn between pitying the character, being utterly disappointed in him, and just wanting him to somehow be better. And the script's maturity really comes into play with this character. No one is beyond reproach, understanding, or grim fate.I'd say that's the main theme here: fate.There's no easy formula. No one simply 'gets what's coming to them.' There are no simple villains or heroes. There's just life and the actions taken and the echoes of those actions and eventually, an end. It transcends any petty ideas of justice or even legend. It takes a full snapshot of a beautiful and grim reality and lets us just take it in, like a corpse on ice. Profound by presentation alone.",Null,14,17,11 November 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Simian Braveheart
","This film is a testament to modern film technology. It is a familiar story about slavery and freedom that cleverly weaves in concurrent themes of super-science, pandemic, and genetic acceleration. An engaging experience that is as much a study in struggle as it is an action/battle movie.The main point of this movie has already been covered by plenty of films and fiction: What happens when some other group of entities attain a sentience formerly only known by humans - the will to assert coupled with intelligence. Whether it be apes, computers, or robots, the prime question is: How will the new beings treat humans? And an ancillary to that is: Will they hold a grudge? This film takes plenty of time to delve into these matters, with quite a few subtle references to man's own enslavement of man, by prison, by arms, and by general attitude. The acting and pacing are just right to let us explore this. But it goes further and PERSONALIZES the whole struggle in the story of Caesar.Amazingly, through well-crafted CGI and the actor/model work of Andy Sirkis, we are captivated by the actions and thoughts of a character, who is not only a different species, but who uses no spoken words through most of the film. This is sheer movie magic, and it's why this movie is important and deserves praise.Sirkis' and the other model actors' work is so nuanced and dense, that the mere posture and gestures of the apes tells us volumes. There's a real genuine emotional force as we share Caesar's life and his discovery of many not-too-pleasant realities, from the joy of his youth, to his first experience with xenophobic anger - his questioning of his origins, his visceral separation from peace, and his rise as a leader of men...er apes. I really have no end of praise for the work done for the non-human characters of this film. Strikingly, it's their performances that are by far the best in the film.And, like Braveheart, by a certain point, we are very much cheering them on. The action sequences are clever and crisp, and a lot of thought went into the questions of how APES would conduct a struggle for freedom and resistance, with unique approaches that are decidedly not human, and therefore quite effective against the unprepared.So come for an action film and linger on the deeper currents. Oh and there's plenty of homage in here too, for the film buffs who actually saw the brilliant originals. Overall one of the best movies of the year.",8,2,6,11 December 2011
Coco," A Tale of Music, Family, and Heart - Weeping for Joy
","I haven't posted a review in some time, but I had to come back to imdb just to share how great this movie is. Imagine an old shining guitar almost buried in bright golden marigold petals. That is this story, deeply surrounded by the rich culture of Mexico, it's Dia de Muertos, and the traditions of remembering our families throughout our lives and generations. Another reviewer said that 'you can't trust anyone who did not get emotional over this movie', and while I won't go that far, I can't see how anyone could not be moved by this story with it's beautiful arcs of familial love, loss, pride, rebellion, hope, and despair. Personally, I wept at the climactic close - a universal rush of gut-wrenching sadness and joy - extremely powerful and meaningful. See this with your family and cry together and feel love together at this magnificent art.",8,0,2,16 June 2018
Thor," Powerful Family Dynamic and Beautiful Landscape
","This is a throw-off piece of Marvel fiction that is packed full of cliché and predictability...to a point.I found myself cringing at a lot of the scenes of heroism and there's a definite stink of pure cheetos-stained fanboyism in many of the scenes in general, with the usual over-the-top 'glory' of this old four-color trope.But certain things caught my attention as well-done.First, Asgard is absolutely beautiful. They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard, the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular, the rainbow bridge, the weaponry, and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.Second, Branagh's touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority. Hopkins does well with that balance, even through some cheesy scripting.And the brothers... the sibling rivalry here is very very potent in that it is nuanced and fully realized by both actors. There is love there, but also a lack of understanding, envy, and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain, in that we see, all in one package - a fighter who protects his allies, an honest counselor, a liar, a cautious thinker, a smooth tongue, and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father, but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it's all very real and very stirring. And even when it's clear that he's done very grim deeds, you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.I was pretty surprised how moving this all was, especially when put in the middle of some otherwise-uninspiring hero pablem.So in summary, this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well, and forget the whole comic-book hero thing, since that's been done far better.Thanks for reading.",Null,30,44,8 September 2011
Rango," Do you want to see a good western, amigo?
","This movie combines phenomenal animation (really amazingly well done), great voice acting, and a script full of wily humor, old-school western legend, and mystic enlightenment. It is a tour de force for both animated movies and a welcome addition to the potent mythology of The West.I felt the plot was a bit convoluted, but it plays out well in most cases, with some very epic moments, and some very surprising introspection at times (meditations on failure, hardship, and identity).And it lives and breathes the essence of the classic western, full of dry, hot, dusty openness and grit. I would actually put this up against Tombstone or Silverado any day - it's got the whiskey and iron for it.",8,0,2,13 June 2011
Straight Outta Compton," Expressing Themselves
","It's 1992, and I'm just a normal teenage kid just starting to expand my musical tastes, and I come across this thing called Gangster Rap...and it hits me like motherfucking train.From Ice T, to Geto Boys, to Bone, to N.W.A. this stuff was potent and vital and raw. And it was musical genius. It was perfect.I think a lot of us grew up with that feeling. And more, it opened our eyes to some things - like how mainstream society can be so blind and deaf to loud new things. How music could intersect with politics and sociology, activism. Not to mention the plight of so many young black men in an American landscape previously dominated by whitewashed culture.And it's nice to see the story of the guys who brought it out, who broke those boundaries, stood up for their freedom of speech, and moved a whole generation with them. The guys who laid the path for so much innovation and really great tunes. To see their personal stories and the troubles and triumphs.A great music biop and a great snapshot of urban culture of that time.",7,3,29,10 October 2015
X-Men: First Class," Generally Solid Stuff
","With any Marvel Comics-based material, there's tons of room for error - from cringeworthy 'fan tribute' to cardboard characters, to contrived plotting, but this movie handles these risks well and delivers a pretty solid story in the meantime.McAvoy is perfectly brilliant as a young, cocky Charles Xavier, who's charisma makes him a natural for leadership and whose moral compass steers him clear of the traps that power can bring. Fassbender is chilling and exciting at the same time as Erik Tellisch (spelling?) whose horrifying past has grown in him a grim desire for justice and revenge harder than steel.Then there's Jennifer Lawrence as Raven, a young woman who finally overcomes her crushing self-consciousness to cast away all masks and become something beautifully lethal. And finally, Kevin Bacon, showing his mastery as a worldly psychopath capable of godlike power.All these roles are well played with plenty of room for fleshing out and development. And they're backed by a solid action script that weaves real Cold War history into itself as seamlessly as genes in a chromosome.Specifically, I liked Nolan's original 2 movies a little better (I'll pretend the 3rd X-Men movie didn't happen, and that wasn't him anyway), but Vaughn here does do a great job and this film can stand proudly among its peers in Action/Hero movies.A good movie. Rent it and enjoy.",Null,0,2,23 September 2011
13 Hours," Beyond any BS - Unexpected Excellence
","Benghazi.In this age of bitter rhetoric, the name conjures all manner of furor and blame. A small stinging wound to honor and prestige - a name to carry hate and zealotry.Michael Bay, OF ALL PEOPLE, was able to peer into the 2012 attack on US diplomatic and intelligence resources, and capture one hell of a war story. Going into this movie, I expected a number of things. Among them were gratuitous explosions, jingoistic flag waving, and tough-guy tired clichés. I did not get what I was expecting.Instead, Bay, his cast, and his filmmaking team have brought out a solid, technically informed, faithfully rendered account of those who were caught in the conflagration - how they found themselves there, how they fought for their lives, and how they made it out...or didn't. There's no political agenda here. The only agenda is to show warriors (who are also real people, with cares, and hopes and flaws) engaged in struggle, with all the courage, and luck, horror, and terrible splendor that is timeless.And in the end, there's no war worship - only somber reflection on the nature of struggle, and what it does to these warriors. This is a clear and worthy work for that. Bravo.",8,170,213,4 June 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," Great Acting but a Ludicrous Script
","I'm voting this down, but I still pretty much enjoyed it. Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, and everyone else in this movie do superbly well with an engaging action thriller. I was engrossed enough in the first 20 minutes to want to see the whole thing through.This movie is about revenge, society's concepts of justice and punishment, and the follies of unexamined ambition. It develops these themes from the start and with a good pace throughout the film. The two main leads and their supporting characters are pretty thoroughly believable and deserve much praise for their work.And the second phase of the film is almost entirely unbelievable. As the action escalates, we are treated to plot action that defies even common sense to hammer home the pervading themes. For specific examples, I'm sure the message boards on this site can elaborate very competently. I was thinking 'oh c'mon...really?' with every scene. It was that horrible.My hope is that whichever producers hacked this up will not be given such latitude in film again. But sadly, schlock sells.If it weren't for the wonderful strength of the performances, and certain nice detail touches during the first phase of the movie, I'd be rating this as a complete failure. Instead, it's a movie with lots of potential and heart that went way way off the rails into stupid Hollywood nonsense.",4,7,14,20 January 2012
