Hereditary," Good story, but the ending...
","At the beginning this story was somehow boring. In the middle got really better and the thriller went to be more interesting. However, the ending was frustrating. A shame because a little more action could turn this movie better.The special effects are poor.",5,0,0,18 April 2020
Get Out," A little slow motion thriller, but worth watching
","Although I consider this movie a little slow, the story is good and worth watching. I think this movie has the merit to be some original. The direction was good enough to keep me locked into the story.",7,0,1,3 May 2020
Logan," Great movie and great story
","This story is just great. The characters are fantastic and the acting of the little girl is notable. Her angry face can be so tender when crying that took me into tears. The end of Wolverine couldn't be better than this. A pitty but necessary to get a final road for this unforgetable character, so well interpreted by Hugh Jackman, as well the incomparable Patrick Stewart, finishing the saga of Professor Xavier, our eternal Captain Picard.",9,1,1,2 May 2020
