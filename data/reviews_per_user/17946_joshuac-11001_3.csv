War Dogs," War dogs is a fun, blast of relief to a pretty bland summer movie season
","War Dogs is many things and bad is not one of them. This film is a ray of sunshine on the recent filmography of Miles Teller who not to mention gives the best performance (so far) of his career and Jonah Hill was a great choice for this role and I think he had a blast playing Efraim. Now where I think this film loses steam a bit is the love story which I think could have been handled a little better, but especially for an action movie romance subplot is was OK. I also thought that Bradley Cooper's character was quite underrated and was a lot more than the throw away character he was going to be. In conclusion, this was one of the best films in the summer of 2016 and it is definitely going to be on my personal list of the top 10 films of the year.",8,0,0,18 September 2016
Dunkirk," Dunkirk is a emphatic war film with great visuals.
",Dunkirk is a captivating and completely immersive from start to end. Out of any of the movies that I have seen this year this movie really peaked my interest because of the unique choices made by the production team (eg; hiring actors that are essentially no names). This film has a great visual style that is intense yet methodical which is complemented very well by the masterful directing by Christopher Nolan. In conclusion Dunkirk is an experience like no other movie that has come out this year so far. Highly recommend it to any type of audience.,10,15,31,22 July 2017
Jaws," Jaws Is One of The Most Suspenseful Films of All Time
","Jaws is so much more than your average horror/thriller film you see today and this movie is 43 years old! The way Spielberg helms the film is unbelievable. Considering this is one of his first films is incredible. I can only imagine how audiences reacted in 1975 when this film first came out. Additionally John Williams score is one of the best and most suspenseful ever. The way the film blends with the music with the visuals is very smooth and gives off a greater sense of dread whenever the shark is lurking in the waters below. The performances in this film are also sensational all around especially from Robert Shaw as quint, a crusty old sailor who was my personal favourite character in the movie. The only issues I have with this film are little nitpicks that I wont spoil for you. Besides that this film is exceptional and I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves movies as much as I do. That is unless you've already seen it then of course, give it another watch you wont regret it.",10,0,2,12 April 2018
