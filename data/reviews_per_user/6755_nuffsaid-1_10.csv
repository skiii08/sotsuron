Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," boring moments
","the movie is boring at times and that is a shame because everything else about the phantom menace rocks! (well almost everything)the wooden acting and so called 'important(but boring)scenes' are to blame for the movie's failure in keeping us entertainedGeorge should have tried filming these scenes in a more exciting way instead of having your characters sit around a table eating some food/fruit...they could have said the same lines and shown the same expressions while avoiding something dangerous...like a sandstorm or whateverthe podrace scene was cool but too long and the beams of the pods looked too computer generated,it looked like some video gameit also needs more action and more daring idea'si rate this movie with a 7and i do love this film ... i love star wars , so George ...keep doing what your doing!",7,0,1,17 October 2002

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," yo!da ...a bouncing green thing
","star wars attack of the clones does not have a very good story the visuals,the sets,the cgi,the special effects look great the acting is a little wooden at times but thats often the case with star wars there is also some good acting in this episode which makes up for all the boring conversations Joda does not satisfy during a fighting scene.....its just to short i like this episode more than episode one because it is a little bit darker...and it contains more action ...george lucas made a mistake with the podrace in episode one which was almost like a movie within a movie ...in episode 2 everything keeps on track with the story... 9/10..............",10,0,0,27 May 2002
