First Man," You did the impossible and made our early Space Flights and landing on the Moon boring
","Ryan Gosling plays an always brooding portrait of Neil Armstrong that came off as one dimensional and uninspiring, if that is possible. At the end of the movie I did not feel attached or close to any of the characters. They were all flat and one dimensional. What I did find humorous, by a humorless movie, was the insertion of the LA LA Land theme music at the end of the movie. I will not spend anymore effort to review this film because it was simply not worth anymore of my valuable time.",1,5,10,25 October 2018
The Irishman," 3 and half hours that would been better used....
","I love Scorsese's films, but this was one, is just one too many. It lacked tight editing, scenes lingered far too long to make artistic points. The technology of that allowed the actors to be made younger was not impressive given the actors could not move as if they were younger. The one scene that made this point, was when De Niro's character roughs up a corner grocer for shoving his daughter. The scene is difficult to watch given De Niro seemed to struggle as much with his own lack of mobility to carry off the fight scene realistically despite having the willing and compliant younger actor. Al Pacino's character looked nothing like Hoffa. Yes the acting was good in general, but the story was just too drawn out and slow and the characters were just not that interesting to hold your attention. As a man of 58, the hardest fact is recognizing the increasing limitation as we age, this movie opens with De Niro's character in an assisted care facility. It is where this movie should have stayed. The Actors and Directors are all legends, but this movie only took away from some of their carrier luster.",3,695,1246,18 November 2019
The Favourite," Medieval Lesbian power play
","Poor soundtrack throughout and in parts nails on chalk board bad. Yet, a somewhat entertaining movie, buttressed by good acting. I could not help to notice the not so subtle attempt to emasculated the men, during a dress up medieval Lesbian Sexual/Political power play. The movie seemed to just give up at the end, confused how to end such a directionalless story after the power play had concluded.",5,43,82,15 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Too simplistic!
","I'm tired of the comic based movie genre which further signals the death of original scripts and content. Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, 'Where is the beef?', or in my case a good story and characters I care about.",1,122,285,18 May 2018
