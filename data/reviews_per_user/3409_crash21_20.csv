Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar Stinks
","I just cannot understand how much they hyped this 'Star Wars: Episode 1' movie coming out, but once you saw it, you learned that the movie was nothing but a bad story, bad characters, alongside awful CGI effects. The movie was centered around what I call the worst character in this movie, Jar Jar Binks. It looked just plain bad, partially thanks to the lame CGI it came from, and Jar Jar Binks had a terribly annoying character though the whole movie. For crying out loud, it wasn't even part of the original Episode I story!Even though the movie had the same bad CGI effects along side awful characters, I sadly have to admit that this is still better than Episode II. The movie at least had a more decent story with characters that had actual lines through the whole movie.",2,0,5,14 October 2016
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. big joke
","I cannot watch E.T. without constantly laughing and rolling my eyes at scenes in this movie. E.T. has to be the most over-hyped, over-dramatized, commercialized, movie that was ever made. This movie is simple proof of what paying the media to hype a movie can get you. E.T. is really nothing more than a dramatic commercial for things like Reese's Pieces and BMX bikes.I think Steven Spielberg gets a lot more credit than he truly deserves, especially with E.T. Steven Spielberg doesn't make these stories believable (as so many people claim), he just makes everything extremely dramatic. The scene in E.T. where the scientists come into the house wearing space suits (by the way his mother is the first to see the suits), is beautiful proof of this. I think this also applies to the scene where they're trying to escape with E.T., and Eliot's brother says 'I've never driven forward before!' Driving forward is the first thing you learn how to do in driving! Plus, he drives forward after backing out of the driveway earlier in the movie. I also love the Halloween eve where E.T. sees a kid dressed as Yoda from Star Wars and screams 'home!', in the same part of the movie E.T. uses the umbrella with crumbled foil for a satellite dish, it's all absolutely comical. And E.T. can't beam up to the space ship because 'this is reality, Greg', yet he can make all of the kids riding bikes float above the neighborhood from a clear blue sky through a dramatic sunset?This movie is labeled as science-fiction. I see a lot of dramatized fiction, but where's the science? The amount of drama in this movie makes me cry, but it's crying laughing.",3,11,21,9 October 2008
Home Alone," Just plain stupid
","First off, wouldn't the family have realized they still hadn't given out an airplane ticket to someone, wouldn't that mean something to them right there in the beginning? This movie is centered all around the pathetic Christmas miracle theory.I have to ask when they realize that the kid has been left home alone by himself, why don't the parents just call the house, a friend neighbor, or even the police to go pick him up? They could even give the cops instructions to use a door-ram on an outside door to get in to the house and secure the kid. When the kid realizes that he has been left home alone, he could go straight to a friend neighbor, call local police, or even call 911.I also love the scenarios the kid supposedly comes up with by himself; first with the gangster movie scene to scare off the pizza delivery, I would hope if the delivery person had actually believed the scenario, that it would be immediately reported to the cops.Then the whole scenario when he realizes the two criminals are going to be trying to rob the house, he comes up with a plan to take them out in a couple hours, the plan nearly kills the criminals and almost burns down the house. After all of this is finished, the kid finally calls the police. If he knew this from the beginning he would have never logically done anything but first call a reliable emergency number.Once the criminals are taken out, he's still home alone and quickly cleans up the stuff that took the criminals out? Then his mom arrives, along with his whole family arriving shortly after. The family is suddenly all together again, was this a Christmas miracle?I will admit, the movie is fun before you're even a teenager, but when you look at it later on, you'll realize it's nothing but a pathetic joke. Logically, it nearly tells kids to do things dangerously while teaching them not to use things that are truly secure like the emergency system.",2,3,7,9 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," I still liked Episode V better, but this was very good too
","The original 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' has rather impressing effects and a great story. When you see what they almost ruin this using CGI and other changes in the movie's later Special Edition, it makes you wonder why they even added things to the original movie.Although, the first half of the movie that involved the rebels' fight against Jabba the Hutt was originally pretty good, the Special Edition had added some poorly edited scenes into all of this. It was also a little slower when Luke whiteness Yoda's death, but the movie does get quite entertaining after Yoda dies.The movie gets rather entertaining, first with the rebels' planning to take down the new Death Star before it becomes completed. The group's discovery of the inner planet's Ewoks group, the concept was a little strange, but not bad. There is another entertaining scene when the Ewoks become help for the rebels in taking down the evil empire on the planet.The original trilogy has a rather nice ending in the fight between dying Darth Vader and the Emperor, along with Luke's realizing he has the same electric hand as he just cut from Vader, then using Vader's remaining positive force to saving Luke from the Emperor. After this, with the rebel's party to their great success, and Luke's personal burn of Darth Vader for a goodbye to his original father.They did make another mistake in this movie's Special Edition with the Death Star's explosion; it had made a lot more sense without the stupid ring going around the explosion of the Death Star, along with other added CGI effects like the scenes on other planets.",8,0,1,10 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Where's the story?
","I can't believe this movie was 2.5 hours long, the dialog for the whole movie could be summed up in less than 5 minutes. I thought Episode 1 was the worst, that is, until I saw Episode 2. I think Episode 1 was sadly better than this, at least it had a story to it. Episode 2 was nothing but one giant action scene, with no dialog to back it up.And as many others have stated, they flooded the movie with terribly fake CGI, this looked more like a stupid cartoon than anything else. It's pretty sad that they can make these scenes look so fake, when they did this so much better with costumes and plastic models in the original Star Wars movies, almost 30 years ago.",1,1,3,5 December 2006
Armageddon," A tribute to the oil drillers?
","This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Armageddon is nothing but a giant action scene, they are running back and forth so much, with actual lines that are so rare that you can't barely understand what is happening in any scene of the whole movie. The only lines seem like they are devoted to the drillers that are (supposedly) saving our planet. I always thought dramatic dust and oil coming from the drillers was what was helping to destroying the planet to begin with.I can't help laughing so much at the drama through Armageddon, it is nothing but an action scene devoted to get people loving the oil industry and the Space Shuttle. If anything, they wouldn't have used the shuttle, and the military would probably be doing most of this, simply in an attempt to knock it off-course, as last resort would they be blowing up the asteroid. I think 'Armageddon' should have been named just plain 'Awful', because it is awful.",1,1,2,3 November 2015
Independence Day," Entertaining but unbelievable
","I will admit, I have loved Independence Day ever since the movie came out. The movie has a good story with a great set of special effects.In the beginning; when the when the SETI guy hears a radio signal while he's listening to REM's song 'It's the end of the world as we know it', I call that a classic moment. Then including Jeff Goldblum's entry to the movie and the aliens sudden invasions to blow-up the cities. The fight back is rather entertaining, but the movie starts going down once they go into the whole Area 51 alien myth (a place that in real life isn't even called Area 51 officially).I love the movie up to the the stuff with Will Smith, his character has some of the most ridiculous macho-man scenes, in rather unbelievable action scenes along with his tribute to the tobacco companies. Along side Jeff Goldblum's saving of the world with an overnight written computer virus for the aliens is rather unbelievable, especially since he starts this immediately after he was tripping around drunk.If anything, a movie like Independence Day is 100 times better than movies like E.T. and Contact. Although, Independence Day always makes me think of a quote from the movie's producer (Bill Pay) who made a quote in a classic Discovery Channel documentary 'Inside Area 51': 'I, in my heart, would like to think that there are aliens at Area 51, but don't really believe it until I see more.'",8,0,0,29 June 2015
Ghostbusters," Classic comedy
","From the beginning through the end, Ghostbusters was a classic comedy. The movie has a really good soundtrack, which includes a uniquely-excellent theme-song, with great characters and the whole movie is very funny.They start the movie with the guys working with the Department of Psychology and Pete is torturing a guy with apparent psychic abilities, possibly just to get himself a date with the girl that is getting everything wrong. Then, when they go to the ghost event in the library, it has things in there that are so funny that it makes you wonder how the actors actually kept straight faces when they were acting this.After they leave the University and start the business 'Ghostbusters', the movie's action scenes seriously picks up. Especially when Pete first gives the guy from the EPA a hard time, after that failing in the later shutdown of their ghost storage facility, one of my favorite moments in all of this is where Pete finds Dana floating around her room saying she is the Gatekeeper and that Dana is gone.The movie had a good ending too, with their fight against Gozer and the Staypuft Marshmallow Man. It was all very funny and is definitely worth watching many times over.",9,5,7,13 June 2016
Back to the Future Part III," From one to three
","I call The Back to the Future movies a trilogy set that was something a lot like the original 'Star Wars' movies, and they made 'Back to the Future Part III' a great part in all of this. 'Back to the Future Part III' was practically an old-west situation with a good amount of science-fiction and humor through the whole thing.Through all of this, you're expecting to see someone get shot and killed in the old west, yet Marty is constantly beating the bad guys. I especially like the ending in the old-west, where Marty has everyone thinking he has been shot and killed by Biff Tannen, then he gets up and simply beats him up having him unconscious, disgusted, and even inadvertently helps with Tannen's arrest. This is a dream for nearly everyone to do to a bully at some point.Watch the whole set of 'Back to the Future' movies side by side and you will find all of them, fun and amusing.",9,5,5,6 August 2015
Mission: Impossible," Unbelievable but somewhat entertaining
","I will admit, I am entertained by this movie, but the whole story is rather unbelievable, from beginning to end. The beginning scenes in the movie are rather strange. Then, after the chaos event, how Ethan gets his own contact with Max all by himself is rather laughable. Although I did like the character Max, she was involved in some of the more interesting moments of this movie.I love how the top secret computer desk in the security office simply has a pullout seat instead of a chair in front of it, because that would probably nail the security system right there with just a rattle. Plus all of the room's security system really needs to prevent the computer broken in is either disconnection from the computer when the person goes out, or even something people had in their home security at the time; motion detectors. You can even have security cameras in the room without direct vision of the computer. It's just ridiculous.The scene when they are on top the TGV is rather interesting, the part with especially with Jim being chased by Ethan towards the rear of a train going at around 360mph, this is rather unbelievable. Especially considering that Ethan's only hanging on with his hands, that's just laughable.I have to say, an earlier movie based on the country's top secret defense, 'True Lies' was a lot better than 'Mission: Impossible'.",5,0,1,9 December 2016
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Unbelievable, but much better than the original movie
","The whole movie 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' was a much better story than the original 'Home Alone', even though it did have a lot of the same dumb moments in the movie. Things like Kevin's supposed stories getting him access to a plane to New York and entry to an expensive hotel room. Then his family's insult to Florida with their supposed bad experience. For crying out loud, they whine about being stuck inside the hotel because of the rain in Florida, yet I hate to tell you this, but snow (which they seem to like) is simply frozen rain. Then, while they're still in Florida, Kevin can get things for himself by simply telling people stupid stories, and out of nowhere he has just what he needs to torture the hotel workers and the criminals.It gets especially bad when he makes the remodeling house of his relatives the center of torture for the same criminals. The scenario is a lot like and maybe even worse than the original movie; he nearly does enough to murder the criminals and things that could possibly destroy the entire house itself.Although I did like the characters like the Pigeon Lady and Mr. Duncan from the toy store, but that was about it. The scenarios with things like Kevin's tricks on the hotel employees (things that would hopefully get police called), alongside his supposed brilliant catch of the criminals using his torture. Note, after all of this he actually does call the police effortlessly. The whole movie is, for the most part, unbelievable and dumb as well.",5,0,1,9 December 2016
Steve Jobs," Just plain awful
","I will agree with this movie a few places, Steve Jobs was a person that asked everyone for a lot, frequently more than the people even thought was possible, but he did at least do this trying to inspire everyone to do the absolute best they can do. I think this movie over-dramatized a lot of Steve Jobs' more negative moments, at least one of which, included a lot of drama in his family situations.I'm not a fan of Apple Computer or the person Steve Jobs, but I have to say that this movie was just plain bad, and not because it was simply about Steve Jobs. The whole movie was just plain slow, they don't give you much to explain the scenes that you are watching, and even though it has some real-life based moments. The movie tends to be over-dramatized practically everywhere you watch. When I saw it, I thought that the whole movie has you looking at Steve Jobs like he was an evil industry gangster or some other kind of organized-crime factor in the IT field. He was hard on people, that's a fact, but there were some good times in there too.I agree with other comments that said to watch TNT's 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' instead, it is truly so much better than this. Or even the old PBS documentary 'Triumph of the Nerds', it explains a lot of the real-life moments in this movie's story and even gives you real-life interviews with some of the people.",5,1,2,1 October 2016
The Lion King," A sweet joke
","I will admit whether they are original cartoons or CGI, Disney's G-Rated are typically nothing but lame 'sweet' crap. The story was lame, and (even worse) the movie had terrible music through all of it. The Lion King is one Disney movie that I saw when it first came out, and it proved this very well in 1994. The whole movie is simply telling kids to be brave and do what you're told.The memories of having to watch this movie will simply give you nightmares. Just watch something like the original 60's 'Flintstones' cartoons instead, they were much more entertaining than 'The Lion King'.",1,14,52,17 January 2016
Back to the Future Part II," Fun, but not quite as good as the rest
","The move had a good connection to the original 'Back to the Future' movie, the movie got a little slow in parts when you compare it with the other movies in the trilogy. I did like their future situation alongside the past situations. But since it has already past 2015 and I am still waiting to see anything close to a flying car, let alone a hover-board item that actually hovers above the ground, instead of something that runs more like a stupid Power Wheels product, the situation does make you question if that will even have a chance to happen.The 2015 part was rather ironic when they saw Arnold Schwarzenegger having been President, when they weren't that far-off after his roll as the Governor of California. Today, it almost makes you wonder if this movie had a part in Schwarzenegger's original inspiration for running to be California's governor.This movie does get a little slow in a few scenes; most of which were the beginning scenes in his trip back to Biff's modified 1985, parts in Marty's correcting trip back into 1955 were somewhat slow too, but (as Marty explains while knocking out Biff) 'Back to the Future II' is still a 'fun' movie to watch. Another moment that was rather interesting and amusing, the ending scene that was simply a picture that pointed directly to the trilogy's incoming ending: 'To be concluded.'",7,0,1,6 August 2015
Speed," A classic joke
","I roll my eyes so many times watching this, I see more of the ceiling than the movie screen. There are so many flaws in this movie's story, I don't know where to begin...First in someone's car he tries to tell the bus there is a bomb on board on the bus, right there, why couldn't the police have contacted the bus through the contact radio? So he has to do a chaotic scene to get onto the bus? That scene is laughable right there.Then the most famous scene in Speed, is the biggest joke; when they jump the unfinished part in the road, wouldn't they just drop down through the hole? Or bang into the other side of the road? Also, why does the bus even have to jump the gap in the road when there were numerous exits before it? (like the exit the bomb squad took). And when the bus is circling the airport runway (with tires taken out by the entrance's spike strip), they can hardly keep the little cart Keanu Reeves is riding under the bus stable, yet, the bus turns round and round, with his cart following flawlessly, plus this somehow has to lead to him poking a hole in the bus gas tank.I also love the last action scene in Speed. This movie was so over dramatized, that all the drama with the bus wasn't even enough, they had to put the characters together on a failed subway car as well. First of all, the subway car wouldn't be running on a track that is still under construction. The scene where they are just crawling on a fast subway car is just a joke, and second, with the failed brake, why couldn't they just shut the engine off and let the car roll to a stop? (instead of having to jump the track) They can speed it up, why can't they just slow it down?Speed is all about ridiculous, over dramatized action, and definitely not logic. For crying out loud, Arnold Schwarzenegger movies are more believable than Speed!",2,7,18,9 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The force in Sci-Fi
","I cannot believe that this movie was made almost 40 years ago, because the whole original Star Wars trilogy is still some of the best science-fiction movies made to the day today. It has a good story and great deal of action scenes that include very interesting characters and more realistic visual effects made with actors, costumes, plastic ship models, alongside an actual story with good lines and a great soundtrack.I don't understand how the original Star Wars trilogy could go behind the recently remade 'Special Edition' versions of the trilogy along with the later movies like 'Star Wars: Episode 1', those were just plain pathetic. Because they seem to just look more like a plain cartoon thanks to CGI effects, including a lack of logic and actual lines in the first three movies that were made later. The original movies there were simply nothing more than real-life scenes with people in costumes, actual lines, and plastic models, were done simply and were so much better. One classic moment screwed up in the Special Editions was when Han Solo meets the bounty hunter Gredo, who was sent by Jabba the Hutt for his money. Han shoots Gredo, then he meets the CGI version of Jabba the Hutt out by Han's ship. The whole situation doesn't make sense, and the added CGI is just plane awful and unneeded for the scene. One more bad situation was the added ring around the Death Star explosion, that was also unneeded and just plain lame.Even though the movie was made nearly 40 years ago, the original 'Star Wars' movie was a great story, a classic soundtrack, alongside special effects that are still some of the best to this day.",9,1,2,15 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best originals
","I actually thought 'The Empire Strikes Back' was the best movie made in the original Star Wars trilogy, even better than the first Star Wars movie.I will admit, the trip that Luke had to be trained as a Jedi by Yoda has some entertaining moments in it, but I also call this the somewhat slow portion of the movie.Just like what they did with the original 'Star Wars: A New Hope' movie, the 'Special Edition' remake of 'The Empire Strikes Back' that they made in the 90's wasn't done well, they did do less to alter this story, but they still had a few bad CGI effects added that did nothing more than mess-up original scenes in the movie.The original story itself is really good. First with their fights with the empire in the snow, then with Han Solo's emergency trip out with Princess Leia on the Millennium Falcon, plus the group's fights against the empire. Then when their trip to get Lando Calrissian's help fails by the empire's quick interference.",9,0,0,6 December 2016
Contact," Good, but nothing special
","After you see Contact, you will realize that Contact was more of a movie that simply got over-hyped. The movie has a good opening half, up to the part where they actually get the signal from elsewhere. I thought that the day after they got the signal was rather amusing, especially where they were driving through the chaos outside and the movie is playing the song 'It looks like a purple people eater to me' was quite amusing.But the part where they start attempting to actually understand what they had just received was simply a bad joke. I almost laugh at the way their received images, having the alien's designs coming together in a cube shape, would something even use a design like this? Imagine how long it could seriously take to understand what came in a signal that includes image formats and whatever else.Then when they quickly get the stuff built, it gets blown-up by some terrorist guy. I can understand someone wanting to blow-up something from the aliens, but then there's a second built version which is unknown to the public and actually only gets to work for the privately built second try. The immediate success in their sudden second location was rather bazaar and lame. Especially when they finally believe the story of her talk with the aliens after nothing but finding extra length in the recordings. Couldn't this have simply been because the equipment wasn't turned off immediately?I honestly liked the opening half of another SETI-based movie, 'The Arrival', much more than Contact.",6,0,2,30 June 2015
Back to the Future," A classic movie in both Comedy and Sci-Fi
","'Back to the Future' has to be one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made, including the film's movie trilogy. It was great with the movie soundtracks and the amount of comedy running through the whole thing.The movie has to be everybody's dream at some point, he starts with a family that is partially wrecked by the father's lifelong bully, alongside his friend scientist shot dead, and (by accident) fixes it all in the past. With a lot of amusing comedy moments in between, one of the classic moments was the 'I hate manure' scenes there were in the whole trilogy.I find it rather sad that most people seem to assume that the DeLorean car in this was just a special car made for the film, because that car was actually a more efficient car made in the 80's. Kind of like 80's version of today's Toyota Prius. Too bad the movie didn't get the DeLorean more popularly bought.Oh well, 'Back to the Future' is a great movie, and to prove this, it is still a popular movie even today.",10,2,2,15 January 2016
Jurassic Park," Just another Spielberg failure
","I will admit, when this movie came out when I was little, I was obsessed with Jurassic Park, but when I watch this today, I roll my eyes at Spielberg's many screw-ups in this movie. The movie is reasonably good up through the parts with the Triceratops, but after that, it gets rather ridiculous.For instance, when the T-Rex gets through the fence hunting down the kids, somehow once the dinosaur gets through the fence, the path back through there is suddenly a 200 ft. drop into the trees below. Then, when the (supposedly electric) SUV falls into the tree below and Dr. Grant comes to rescue Tim. He gets Tim out of the SUV safely, and right there, both Dr. Grant and Tim are safe out of the way of the SUV . Why do they have to get back in front of the SUV? Just so there can be a dramatic scene with the falling SUV chasing them? Plus, that SUV most likely wouldn't just fall like that, the SUV would most likely just tumble out of the tree.The movie does get a little better with when they power the stuff back up and when you get to see technical things again, plus scenes like Dr. Grant faking getting fried on the fence, that was entertaining. But, then it just goes right back to plain drama when Tim gets fried for real (while he's simply six feet from climbing down and off of the fence). Another one in this was where the raptor suddenly bursts through the circuit breaker panel in the utility room.As you can see, the majority of this movie was devoted to Spielberg's ridiculous need for drama, not making the story believable. I just don't understand how Spielberg can work so hard to make the dinosaurs look believable and then screw up so much else in this story.The story the book told was so much better than this.",6,8,17,7 June 2009
