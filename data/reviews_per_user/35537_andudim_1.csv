The Monuments Men," Liked it
","After having seen the trailer I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, not only because of the cast, but the plot as well. However, I couldn't help noticing the bad reviews, made by the critics and/or IMDb users and its poor rating. Honestly, I really liked it. This movie isn't supposed to be a heart-breaking drama or a war-action movie. It's just a movie about art and some things that happened during the war. It presents facts and raises awareness regarding arts and our history.You can't expect to see fights or violence in such a film. People say that the performances weren't good and there was little and unconvincing dialog. I disagree. The main characters are a group of art critics and university professors, who are obviously calm and mild people. It won't be an academy award winner for sure, but it's good and I for one recommend it",8,16,26,16 February 2014
