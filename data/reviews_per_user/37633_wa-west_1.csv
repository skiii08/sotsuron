Walk the Line," Excellent Movie!!
","The movie was excellent. You couldn't have cast a better pair for 'The Man in Black' and June Carter, then Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. They nailed their roles as the two legendary singers and could sing well to boot. I think this movie is definitely Phoenix's best performance. I truly think this is his big breakout movie. Witherspoon played her role as the comedic, talented performer, June Carter very well and deserved the Oscar she received. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the way they portrayed Viv. Cash. In my opinion, they made her out to be a villain.. and I did not think that was deserved. Now as far as knowing how she was in real life, I have no clue. However, I think that was the only drawback. Other then that, I thought the movie was well written, well performed, and would recommend to anyone whose a Johnny Cash or June Carter fan.",10,0,0,13 April 2006
