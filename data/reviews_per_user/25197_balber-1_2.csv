Mission: Impossible III," Technically superb and more straightforward than I @ II
",I guess its kind of expected that an MI movie will look and sound good but this really looks and sounds good.It also does not become so convoluted that you just kind of give up on the story as I kind of did on the first two(esp. MI-I).I think this MI shows a little more emotion and a little more vulnerability and that was a good thing.Cruise is good and Hoffman is better.I get the feeling that a lot plot lines and scenes were left on the cutting room floor as sometimes things just get tidied up too easily.But the movie flowed okay and moved fast for its 2 hr. plus length.I was never bored but neither was I lost in the story either. But all in all I think this is a solid entry in the series even though easily forgettable once you walk out the door.,7,1,13,9 May 2006
Silent Hill," confusing,but visually arresting
",Silent Hill will probably baffle some of those not familiar with its world but its great visuals and CGI will make it a good experience anyway.Gans does his best to explain the world of SH but he is only partially successful.Filmgoers not familiar with the game may not understand why the main character does what she does and why she goes the places she goes.The movie is not particularly scary but is certainly creepy(there is a difference between the two!)and does a good job in creating its own 'world'.The acting is fine with no real standout performances.I wish the film had more action-in the games the main character does a lot of fighting of the various monsters.In the movie the main does more running and chasing.The ending will confuse and maybe even irritate some but I found it intriguing.The good thing about the movie is it is interesting enough for filmgoers to want to see more and Gans has done a good enough job not to offend the gamers and still draw new fans in.,7,3,6,9 May 2006
