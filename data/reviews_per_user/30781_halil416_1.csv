Mission: Impossible III," Below Average, unexpectedly!
","Honestly, it's not even fair to expect some breakthrough imagination since this is third of the sequel and personally I hadn't expect any new idea nor any surprise which is undone. On the other hand, I think I would have the right to expect getting me into some MI style action with some outstanding acting beyond usual action cinema feeling. Mr. Cruise was not in the mood of previous MI series. He was just doing his job without having the feeling of actually living in the adventure. With that rather poor feeling, acting he delivered was stuck below average and never got to rise during the entire film as expected.I leaved the film in the middle, since I couldn't resist the predictable path of scenario with accompanying poor acting.",3,0,2,25 January 2008
