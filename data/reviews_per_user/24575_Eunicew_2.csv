The Blair Witch Project," Truly artistic
","For those who claim this movie isn't scary, GIVE ME A BREAK!  A part (even a very small part) of every one of us had to have felt a little unnerved. I give them credit for making a near blockbuster movie with very little $$. Overall, I thought it was great due to its accurate portrayal of human fear and I will give it a scariness factor of 9 out of 10. Definitely see it!",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A Must See .... over and over and over
","I truly loved this movie and I feel in order to get the full extent of its meaning it is to be watched and analyzed time and time again. I agree with some critics that if you prefer movies that don't require you to think then don't bother seeing it because you will hate it and tell everyone it is a bad movie, which isn't fair. As with the Shining this movie must be digested a couple of times before you catch all of the important aspects of the movie. It was hyped up a little too much and it appeared as though it would appeal to a mass audience, which it unfortunately does not. If you love Kubrick, go and see it.",Null,0,0,2 August 1999
