Walk the Line," Better than expected
","Every one I've talked to that has scene this movie either loves it or hates. it. I was pretty much indifferent. It was better than I thought it would be, but still very lacking. The story jumps too much. You just start to get a feeling for that part of Johnny Cash's life then its bam 2 years latter. Almost none of the characters were developed in the story except Johnny Cash and June Carter. At the end of the movie I didn't even remember most of the characters names. The man lived an incredibly interesting life and they decided to touch a little of every aspect, but in the end didn't really go into detail of any of it. The movie also seemed to drag a lot, which you would think would allow them to go into detail, but alas, no. The movie was by no means bad, and I'm glad that I saw it, but I don't think it is the masterpiece everyone is making it out to be.",6,0,2,16 December 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Not too bad
","This Movie was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. In fact I even sort of enjoyed it. It starts of pretty weak, apparently Dennis Quaid is the only person in the world to be able to predict a huge storm that is going to change the climate and the world forever. What caused such a storm, pollution. Of course the US government ignores him, wouldn't you, and terror ensues. This movie is basically a run of the mill natural disaster movie with with descent special effects. Nothing all that special, but if you enjoy natural disaster flicks you will probably like this one. The movie would have been way better had Donnie Darko and Dennis Quaid had died at the very beginning and the homeless man was trapped in with a bunch of supermodels. However, it did not happen that way and there is only an OK and not great movie.",5,0,1,14 August 2005
