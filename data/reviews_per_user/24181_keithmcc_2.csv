The Blair Witch Project," Please, wait for the video
","All right, I'll tell you what IS scary.  What's scary is that this movie is doing so well in the box office--hopefully, after all the suckers who bought the hype see this movie, they'll tell their friends what a yawner it really was and the sales will drop off.  Luckily, I saw this movie for free at a sneak preview a few months ago, and I foolishly thought then that interest would drop off and we wouldn't have to deal with yet another gimmicky movie making a ridiculous amount of money and sinking the film industry further into the mire it has been festering in for the last twenty years. Look, guys, the movie isn't scary.  We the audience don't hear the things go bump in the night, or get any sense of the darkness of the woods--it is simply relayed to us by our frantic trio of pre-adults, as is all the vital information in this film.  'The Blair Witch Project' is a great ghost story--that is, a story you read or hear.  But film is a VISUAL medium, relying on what you see or, as effectively, don't see.  This movie chooses neither of these paths--instead, we play witness to 80-some minutes of talking, talking, talking by actors who don't have the benefit of a script. Sure, they are scared; sure, they fight.  But so do the nimrods on Jerry Springer, and you don't see anyone being kept up at night by that drivel. I don't quite know what is so terrifying about this flick.  The characters walk around taping trees, get scared over a bunch of sticks (among other things, all of which can be categorized as 'meaningless objects meant to scare you') and mostly waste their breath arguing about nothing.  True, the last five minutes are pretty dang jittery, I'll admit I got the heebie-jeebies--but when's the last time it was worth 8 bucks for five minutes of belated, schlocky entertainment? So wait for the video, rent it for your kids, along with other classics like 'Urban Legend' and 'Disturbing Behavior.'  those are all cute little fright flicks, mutant afterbirths of that mother of neo-horror, Scream.  But please don't do truly gut-renching cinema the dishonor of worshipping 'The Blair Witch Project' as something special.  Read a frickin' book instead.",Null,0,1,29 July 1999
The Matrix," well, at least I didn't fall asleep.
","okay, now I hate to say this, and please don't take this as a flame, but you guys are idiots.  'The Matrix' is not that great.  Granted, the new 'flow-mo' special FX are neat, but they really didn't get used that much, and not that well either (the Gap commericials are way cooler.)  the whole 'dodging bullets' sequence wasn't too spectacular either.  As for the rest of the film, well, we all have already acknowledged that it rips off every sci-fi movie since 'Alien,' so I won't harp on that.  I know I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief and hang on for the ride, or something.  but considering the 'ride' consisted of about four increasingly repetitive fight scenes and whole lot of grim and meaningless filler, I don't exactly know if that counts as a good enough reason to praise the film.  And since the 'complex, thought-provoking' plot was explained in the first 30 minutes and simply reiterated through the rest of the movie, that didn't hold my attention either.  I dunno, I'm just saying that 'The Matrix' was one of the few movies I've heard get good reviews since the New Year, and I'm still feeling pretty unsatisfied.  sigh.",Null,0,0,16 April 1999
