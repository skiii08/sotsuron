Requiem for a Dream," Astonishing, nerve-wrecking, and heart-breaking.
","I have never seen a movie that has affected me to the point the 'Requiem' did.  Like jewinda, I too left the movie feeling sick, mentally, emotionally, physically.  The raw truth and profundity is astonishing.  The movie grips you and draws you in and doesn't let you go until you have experienced the full hell of drug-addiction...and then it leaves you behind in the dust, still alive and wondering just exactly what happened. Incredible, amazing, but watch at your own risk!",Null,0,0,13 July 2001
