The Incredible Hulk," Entertaining, but lacks the depth of the first.
","I think this version gets it easier than Ang Lee's Hulk because most already saw the origin story in Lee's attempt and see Leterrier's as a continuation of the series. There's slightest attempt here at an explanation or background, just small flashes and fragments in the opening credit sequence. And to my understanding this was just a 're-imagining' ? so where's all that? Seems like they're exploiting Lee's HULK in that department. All that aside, this version does provide what the original was lacking; the showdown between two big monsters. And we are supplied with a lot more action than in the first, if my memory serves me right. Pace is clearly faster, because they don't have to worry about building up any kind of background story (Hey, I can't just let it go if this is being labeled as a 're-imagining') so the emphasis is on other things.I think this version has what the first lacked, but it lacks what the first had. You could probably combine the two films in a great manner which would result in the ultimate Hulk film. I smell a fan-edit.",7,1,4,20 June 2008
Zodiac," David Fincher stamp all over
","The movie was just great, don't go in expecting Se7en part 2, because it's not. This movie is a lot more upbeat, with comedic elements but still retaining the trademark Fincher atmosphere. The Thomson Viper does wonders for this film to capture the light in the night scenes and sets the atmosphere perfectly. One thing you will notice is innovative Fincher camera techniques/movements in the film that begin in mere seconds of the film's beginning. (That POV shot out of the car's window had me grinning, and turning to my friend) The movie IS long, 2 hours and 40 minutes - but it's SO involving that you don't really care about the time. It's like with King Kong remake, the time flies by pretty much. Unless you're extremely uninterested.The Transamerica Pyramid being constructed in time-lapse was the highlight moment for me because Fincher managed to sneak in his trademark style that he had previously showed in the Hewlett-Packard commercial. That had me grinning because it looked so cool not to mention the concept of time flying by instead of just using transition effects and some title cards saying 'XX months/years later' Very unique.Also a very suspenseful scene down in the basement! Zodiac has Oscar nominations coming to it. I definitely see Robert Downey Jr. for Supporting actor, some technical awards, editing, DP, maybe even Director I love how this film has an epic feel to it, spanning the entire Zodiac timeline, and going even up to early 90's - how great is that. I grinned when I saw 1991.It's been too long for Fincher, hopefully no more 5 year breaks. Next is Benjamin Button.Any TRUE Fincher fan is going to love this film.",8,1,5,3 March 2007
We Are Marshall," Surprising
","Color me very surprised! McG is indeed a capable director. This film lifted off a load off my shoulders concerning the horribly titled upcoming Terminator Salvation but that's small stuff. We've seen this story a dozen times before, while it is of course a true story, the subject matter does have its' 'sports movie' clichés. That aside however, because the direction, acting, and cinematography combined pack an emotive punch resulting in a very well made drama ala Friday Night Lights, which I think is a bit better myself. I felt McG really demonstrated his potential in this film as a serious director and not a style over substance he seemed to be with Charlie's Angels films. Aside from a relatively strong story he did bring in the visuals, which added a nice look making the film style WITH substance.",8,2,2,8 July 2008
Tropic Thunder," Funny spoof of every war film ever made
","Saw this at the Washington, DC screening on the 10th.And Got Some I did. A comedy that is not Apatow's is refreshing nowadays. A relentless hard R comedy that fuses elements of practically every famous war film ever made. Beginning with trailers a la Grindhouse for every major character was already a sign of a hilarious film. While most of the humor was 'funny-but-i'm-not-laughing' the same amount of laugh out loud humor and gags was provided as well, courtesy of mostly Stiller and Downey Jr. Who I wholeheartedly feel - stole the show. I can't say I've ever seen any character like his in a film of this genre, which already I feel will enter the classics. What's refreshing about Thunder is that it's actually original in certain aspects of the storyline; such as when they decide to shoot the film guerilla style in the jungle only to have the director of the film....- I'll leave this at that. A spoof of war films that isn't tireless or idiotic like the recent Epic/Date films... which do not even deserve to be called 'spoofs'. And be prepared for Cruise, who plays the most radical role of his entire career.",7,136,260,12 July 2008
Batman Begins," Batman Begins
","Minor SpoilersThis is Gold, This is It. This is Why, I love going to the movies! movies like Batman Begins, which do not take storytelling for granted, but instead worship it like gold on a golden platter! Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer - have created something all the previous 4 Batman films combined could not even get close to accomplishing! I will tell you straight up that I had not read every comic book of Batman; in fact I had not read any Batman comic books. I had not read every single graphic novel of Batman, and I, did not love Batman as much as all the fans worldwide have. But let me tell you, that it does not take all those things to really appreciate and understand who Batman really is. I have only seen/read so much of Batman before this film that it made me realize how much more this character stands out from all the other comic book superheroes that were created.This film is exactly what a Batman movie should be. It's been done justice to the character the way Burton, Schumacher or any other person who had ever laid their hands upon this character prior to Goyer and Nolan, could have never imagine of.This is the ultimate, most faithful adaptation that has ever graced this world of Batman, ever.The movie rocked harder than a Metallica concert. I loved the grounded realism. If you compare and contrast Burton/Schumacher's 'gothic' themed Gotham City against Batman Begins' 'present day corrupted, filth-ridden city' you will see it for yourself that Batman Begins is a much more believable film than all the previous four. It makes you feel that something like this in the world can truly exist and Exists! And that there is a person out there without any superhero powers that takes matters into his own hands, dedicating his life to fight injustice, is trying to save and get rid of scum in the city to prevent more murders like that of his parents' Christopher Nolan, once showed a screening of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner to his film crew before they started filming the movie. After the film he said to the whole crew, 'This is how we're going to make Batman.' He not only stayed true to his words, he achieved them. The Narrows of Gotham just look downright filthy. It's so realistically portrayed. I loved every second of it.As a recently converted Batman fan, having read the graphic novels upon this movie is inspired. ('The Long Halloween' & 'Dark Victory' by Jeph Loeb) I was amazed, I thought the film was incredible. 10/10 I was in disbelief of what I saw.One time back in the summer of 2003, I had finally seen a movie I have been dying to see. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. I am a big fan of Terminator. When I saw it. I literally gave it a 10/10 and I raved and raved about how good it is and how much better it is than T2. I jumped to conclusions, and as time went by and I read more and more opinions and thoughts of others on T3 I looked back and thought 'I can't believe I thought this was greater than everything' And then a movie like Batman Begins comes out and you think it truly is, the greatest  and I think I'm right this time. This is a movie not only Batman fans have been waiting for, but a movie people like me, whose favorite movie of all time was T2 since I was a little boy, have been waiting for. Batman Begins can truly stand on its' own as a 'film' not just a character adaptation of a superhero, even though it is the foundation. You ignore all the comic books, novels, merchandise, capes, TV shows, cartoons  and you see this movie as a stand alone. You will appreciate it just as much as you appreciate your favorite movie of all time.Gordon: 'I never said thank you' Batman: 'And you'll never have to' (Batman jumps off the building and glides off into the darkness) A shot of Gordon smiling.Fade to black When the screen faded to black, and the credit 'A Christopher Nolan Film' appeared, I erupted in applause, I was the first one to applause and I'm glad I did it because I didn't think twice; I just loved every second of it. Several people joined in for about 10 seconds! People loved it. My audience was mostly composed of teenagers ages 17+, some adults, and people in their mid 20's to 30's People laughed at every joke that was intended to be humorous.I had not watched a single movie with so much time having my mouth and eyes, wide open. Every scene in which the Batman was present on screen, my expression was of someone who had seen a ghost. Incredible movie. Incredible",10,9,15,16 June 2005
Peaceful Warrior," The one film, you must see in your lifetime - and you better see it quickly.
","Absolutely shocking how powerful this movie is. It's one of the films that will be loved by people who can relate to it, and I'm one of them. Dan Millman is Rocky for new generation. And who would've thought Victor Salva, who made Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, was behind this. I've wanted to see Peaceful Warrior since the first time I saw the trailer, I've read all the raving reviews about how amazing and life-changing the book is and I was absolutely hyped for this. I wasn't disappointed, not even once. I think this film's message is so powerful, and so profound that it puzzles me why this was so under the radar during it's release in the cinemas. I'm a 'sucker' for inspirational films - I think they're the one way to get people to learn something from them and take action in their own lives.Peaceful Warrior has now become one of my top favorite inspirational films, up there with Dead Poet's Society, and Rocky",10,1,4,31 July 2007
The Happening," Unintentional
","James Newton Howard's score is the best thing about this film. That isn't to say this film totally blows as the majority seems to say. No, this isn't worse than 10,000 B.C. it's tightly directed, and Shyamalan keeps the pace quick and snappy. The progression of events is fast, we get treated to bits of information every so often, music is brooding and fitting for this type of film. So what's wrong? Unintentional or intentional 'comedy', I can't tell which for sure, but the fact that the stupidity outweighs 'intentional' and Mark Wahlberg pulling Nic Cage in 'The Wicker Man' tells me this film suffers from bad writing and bad acting, making my conclusion to be - unintentional.Wahlberg is a capable actor, but he's a parody here and he isn't alone. Maybe this is Shyamalan's fault, allowing this from his actors, or his overall direction of actors.The 'shocking' moments, are not all that shocking either. However, Shyamalan's utilization of the landscape is effective, and in my mind the 'greatest' suspense occurred during the very end of the film, which felt less comical and more hard-hitting.All comedy aside, thinking back on this film, there is certainly a deeper layer that underlies the film. The closest comparison I could think of is The Mist.",6,2,9,14 June 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Touching and deep.
","This is Nicholson's utmost finest performance, period. So many emotions have been aroused in me during the viewing of this film. It is an achievement that stands the test of time. It's not a secret why Milos Forman is highly regarded as true craftsman. He sets a perfect balance of comedy and drama. It can be uplifting in one moment, then turn downright depressing the next. There's nothing I could add but echo what's been said before. I think this film should not be missed. It took me a second rewatch a few years later to realize the importance of this film. Essentially, this is a film about freedom. Spiritual and physicial and how absolutely necessary it is for humans to 'break free' from the chains that hold us down. The institution is a perfect metaphor for these chains.",10,0,2,31 May 2008
Heat," A crime masterpiece
","This film will never cease to keeping me, or anyone else who loves well written, character-driven, and all around effective films - so involved and astonished. Michael Mann creates (actually, it's really all there already) a whole world through his attentive eye to details, distinctive characters, and just astonishing cinematography. He knows the meaning of balance, and knows just when to show certain characters in order to move everything to a certain point. Never throughout the film I felt something lagged. Each scene is brought in, and is dealt with in a way that always moves the story forward. That's perfect film-making. A definite masterpiece of the crime genre, and it's no wonder why Nolan is tipping his hat to this grandiose piece of work in The Dark Knight.",10,1,3,5 July 2008
