The Equalizer," All Hype and no substance
","The first 20-30 minutes of the movie was good. But after that, the story just sags. Nowhere near 'Training Day' quality or story. Sad that it is a Denzel Washington movie and we do not see much of his acting skills. If you have nothing else to do on a boring weekend afternoon, then go watch the Equalizer. InterSteller and Gone Girl were much better than Equalizer.The first 20-30 minutes of the movie was good. But after that, the story just sags. Nowhere near 'Training Day' quality or story.

Life of Pi," Movie of the Year 2012
","Astounding movie experience!! Gripping story line that keeps you involved, and at the same time is simple and thought provoking. You start becoming / living the life of Pi as the film progresses and that is the real achievement of the movie. You are not a passive movie audience anymore.Most of you may not be aware, but 'Life of Pi' is loosely based on the TRUE STORY of a person who survived a shipwreck along with a Jaguar. Yann Martel's 2001 Book 'Life of Pi' on which the movie is based upon was in-turn based on Moacyr Scliar's 1981 novella 'Max and the Cats', which in-turn was based on a true story.The quality of the 3D graphics are so real that few scenes may scare the children, but this is too good a movie to skip just because of this fact. Watch it, and then watch it again. This movie may well end up becoming one of your Top10 movies of all time.Simply great!! Two thumbs and two toes up :-)",10,11,22,23 November 2012
