10 Cloverfield Lane," It could have been shorter
","There are not many movies that can glue you to the screen with only 3 main characters, and 10CL is one of them. Whenever you thought you were right, the movie proved you wrong again and again. It's good that they still make this kind of movies nowadays. It had its dull moments, but not for long. As the time went, you became hooked to the story, wanting to know more. All actors/actress did great jobs in the movie. I gave it only 7 because it could have been shorter.",7,1,1,11 October 2017
3:10 to Yuma," Disappointed
","I had high hope before watching this. It is a highly-rated movie with great casts. I had to say I was disappointed. The movie is very long. Unnecessary scenes and pointless dialogues were scattered all over the movie. I believe this movie can be cut short into 1.30 hours at most, instead of 2 full hours like this. I had no problem with all actors' performances but felt bored after 1 hour passed because the movie still didn't go anywhere, and I had not got any excited from the movie yet. I know this movie is a remake. I intentionally watched this one first, then plan to watch the original later. Unfortunately, this version already gave me bad impression. Now I don't know what to expect with the original. But I will watch it anyway.",6,0,1,1 November 2017
Us," Boring.
","I love everything in Get Out. So I have a high hope in Us. It turns out I hate everything in this movie. The story is not believable. The plot is bad, and the the acting is a joke. Two hours spent is totally wasted. This movie should have gone straight to a video.",5,1,2,12 June 2019
Inside Out," Failed miserably
","Disney's animation never runs short of the idea. This one is again giving us something fresh, a girl with 5 living emotions inside her head. Unfortunately, it lacks the most important thing of an animation --- fun. Without fun, nothing is worth seeing. This movie is not fun for the kids, not fun for teens, and not fun for adults. It tried too hard to teach life lessons but it failed miserably. The movie is boring, below Disney's standard, and nothing to talk about.",6,2,10,5 October 2017
Gone Girl," Disturbing in a good way
","What can I say? This movie is disturbing in a good way. I am normally not giving any movie rating of 8 or above, but this movie deserves it. The story is predictable, you know what's gonna happen, but you still want to know how it will go. I had to hold my breath a few times in the movie, and I kind of like it. Having never watched the leading actress in any of her movies before, I was so surprised by her performance. She was so outstanding that she brought all characters up to her level. Even Ben looks great in this movie. You will be amazed and terrified while watching. What's more, it will leave you speechless at the end. Be warned.",8,1,1,9 October 2017
Mama," Disappointed
","I watched this movie because it is the It director's movie. I intend to watch It this weekend so would like to see first how he worked with his old movie, after all they are the same horror genre. I must say I am disappointed with Mama. It is just an OK movie. There were so many CG involved and it made the story unconvincing. Hopefully, he has already improved his directing skill with It. Let's see.",6,1,2,3 October 2017
Parasite," Don't believe the hype.
","I appreciate the effort of the Parasite team, the director Joon-Ho Bong in particular. He tried hard to get recognized from the international audience by creating a non-typical Korea film. Unfortunately, this is overdoing. The movie is too long and quite boring. Many scenes are unnecessary. Yes, there are times that the movie are fun and entertaining, but to say it is the best film of the year, I don't think it is the case at all. I will be shocked if this movie wins any Oscar award.",6,5,22,28 January 2020
Deadpool," Deserves a sequel
","It's is a fun ride. This is not a typical superhero movie. It can't be 100% possible in real life but who cares. The movie is for the grown- ups, and they made sure all the fun was in there. Ryan Reynolds got a breakthrough role here. He is definitely the cool guy not for the bad guys want to be around. The actress is great too. Beautiful as she is, she can be a naughty, and it was a great joy to watch. She and Reynold had such good chemistry together. The movie is fast pace and the action scenes are great. This superhero definitely deserves a sequel.",7,1,2,17 October 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Long boring movie
","A war movie for me is difficult to make. Making one side morally better than the other, it became propaganda. Even though the movie tried not to focus on the war, rather the life of the miracle man, Mr. Doss, himself, I felt it was too long to take. The first half of the movie is just for the background of him, and I felt it was unnecessary. You can literally enter the theater an hour late, and still wouldn't miss the point. I believe this story is true and give so much respect to Mr. Doss for what he have done. But while watching, my mind was asking what American doing there in Japanese territories. Maybe I am not American so I was not so much into the movie. But, ironically, the director, Mel Gibson is not American either. For me, this one is just another long boring movie.",6,1,5,1 November 2017
