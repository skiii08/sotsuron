Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars what else to say?
",Do you really need a description about this movie? just go to the theater or rent it now! If you are a fan of the old Star Wars eps then you will love this one too. The act is fairly good but like the old Star Wars the movie is great for the story and special effects. Go George Lucas give us the rest of the eps!:) ah btw i would like to see Quentin Tarantino directing a Star Wars :) heh,10,8,10,15 April 2001
