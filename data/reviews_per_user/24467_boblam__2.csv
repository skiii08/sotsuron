The King's Speech," one of the most overrated films of recent years....
","Oh dear, oh dear....so many votes, so many Oscars, it makes me wonder what has happened to our sense of values. This is one of the most over-hyped films of recent years. Talk about cream cakes and royal stories, it is enough to make me think a royal wedding is in the offing...mmm, could be a film there. The story of George VI and his stammer is well known but was it enough for a film which stretched like elastic until it rebounded. I believe this was a typical 'English' film which played to the 'soft centre'of English sentiment. Was there a moral to this story? George VI was a decent man? His character was moulded by his family history ? He triumphed over adversity ? Nothing special there. And as for the acting, well that was pretty ordinary . In short this film doesn't rank high. One really wonders how it would have rated without the syrupy press reaction and the topicality of the latest royal wedding party. No, if you want to see this story as it should be told, turn to the television version ( of the same name ) black and white archive footage and a non-dressed up commentary. Much better by far.",5,5,12,5 April 2011
127 Hours," well, guess what ?
","Knowing the story behind this film as it was reported at the time i was looking forward to an earth moving film experience....how disappointing. Starting with a sound track designed to rattle windows on Mars and an introduction which, far from exciting my anticipation, had me wondering if i was in the middle of another film altogether. It must have been difficult to make this film stand up with such a limited story line,resultingly there is continual 'padding-out' which certainly drained my interest. Not very often i find myself nodding off in the middle and looking at my watch. Slumber was however difficult with the music beating heck out of my eardrums. The flash backs really were a nonsense, i mean,was the director trying to force me to tears. ( He failed on that score ) By comparison ' Touching The Void ',a similar theme, was much more successful. Trying to sum up as the credits scrolled down at the end, i came to the conclusion that this was some sort of rock/pop music suite which used the moving image as an accompanying instrument. OK, it had it's moments but for me it would have needed both arms trapped by that boulder to make it watchable.",4,4,9,22 February 2011
