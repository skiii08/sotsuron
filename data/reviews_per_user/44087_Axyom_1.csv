Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The flaw of the masterpiece
","There are three things wrong with the Phantom Menace: Jar, Jar, Binks. There, I've said it.The problem with Jar-jar binks is that he is the epitomy of the PG rating, with his playfulness and silly disposition. Whenever he pulls a gag, I feel a familiar bile rise in my throat like that of when I watched the ewoks jumping up and around. Certainly, it appeals to the younger crowd (13 and under), but those of us who have grown UP with star wars want something darker and deeper than a silly CGI creature whom we can barely understand.What we want, Lucas delivers but not enough of it to satisfy. While the underwater effects, the pod race & the battle scenes are all amazingly created and presented, they are either too bright and playful, or rely too heavily on effects to carry them through.  What many Star Wars fans demand, is a heavier emphasis on the mystic and mythical plot, and a darker tone to the series, in order to inspire the sort of serious emotional grip that only darkness can deliver.For instance, in one major battle scene, jar-jar binks manages to defeat many droid through his bumbling actions. While this is great slapstick entertainment for children, we as the grown audience would like more fear attached to the situation; much like Braveheart's battles which were grimier and painstakingly horrifying.  That sort of edge (though changing the ratings) would shift Star Wars into something deeper and more powerful.The other major flaw with this movie, is not in the dialogue, but in the execution of it. Ewan McGregor (as Obi-wan Kenobi) does an excellent job of his lines, no matter how short. Other cast members fall downward from that standard. To fail in their dialogue, is to break the spell that they carry -- and not suspend the reality for the audience.But overall the movie has an excellent story and structure, which adds tremendously to the trilogy with every moment.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
