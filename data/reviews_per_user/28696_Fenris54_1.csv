"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Stereotypes that make you laugh...
",It is true that this movie is filled with stereotypes but probably that is what makes it so funny. I laughed outloud so many times while watching this movie. The stereotypes make it so outlandish that I can't really see it offending it anyone because it is not even close to the way people are. Also although it makes a point about tolerence it doesn't go into the old moral of  [insert minority group here] are people too. It's a great movie so see it!,Null,1,2,26 March 2003
