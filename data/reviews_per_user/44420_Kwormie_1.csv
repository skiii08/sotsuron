The Ring," Great For a Scare!
","I saw the movie on opening night, I believe that it was well made. Sure there are some holes in the story but all in all well put together. It has been a long LONG time since I went to the movies and got a good scare, at some points in the movie my heart did beat a little faster then others.The Ring, creepy, scarry, chilling. When you get home from watching the movie, you will more then likely take a hammer to your VCR.I give it 8.5/10",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
