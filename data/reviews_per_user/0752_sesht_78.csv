Million Dollar Arm," Low key, but decent
","Had never heard of American Baseball reaching Indian shores before, but it apparently had, according to the true story this movie's based on. A good friend of mine also mentioned following it at the time, and making the connection while watching this one (where the hell was I, and what the hell was I doing?). :-).A slice-of-life / rags-to-riches tale for the main protagonists, this is also a tale of (in-your-face, simplistic) redemption for the main character, who's a cad, conforming to the common perception of most agents. Yes! they're as 'beloved' as lawyers are, never mind 'Jerry Maguire'!This one can't shake off that particular comparison, or others (more on one more later) and doesn't try to avoid those much. What Gillespie (Fright night remake, Lars and the real girl) gets right is his complete focus on the overarching theme, and the fish-out-of-water aspect to the entire thing, though the effect is not dramatic enough to shake off the overall TV movie low-budget feel.It helps that this has been penned by Thomas (Tom) McCarthy, of 'Station Agent' and 'Visitor' fame, though this doesn't quite reach the heights those works did. The sequences where they're scouting around for the various pre-final tryouts are glossed over, but contain a few nice tidbits, with Alan Arkin front-and-center. They're lightweight funny bits that are there to beat any tedium one might feel. Gillespie also tries to avoid many of the racist clichés that abound, and succeeds to an extent.Lake Bell, as always, is a delight, but doesn't have anything substantial to do, as such.Suraj Sharma (Life of Pi) has come a-ways, and the intensity he shows in his performance, with the limited scope provided, is quite impressive. Madhur Mittal, on the other hand, also playing against type, is required to keep it toned-down, and succeeds. In fact, one of the key reasons I feel this movie succeeds is from the strength of its performers. Hamm is serviceable though, and that's not his fault, for he's just playing a stock character, and its a walk in the park for an actor of his caliber. Other than Alan Arkin, the scene-stealer is Pitobash (Shor in the city and Dibakar Bannerjee's Shanghai), who's supremely effective in each one of his scenes. All of the actors respect the material, and do not try to belittle it in any way, performing their roles to the extent required. Aasif Mandvi's also one who gets another stock character, and does what he can with this thankless, yet beefy role. Darshan Jariwala, Bill Paxton (not many meaty roles these days - he chomped the scenery in '2 guns') and Tzi Ma do just fine, and its nice to watch them interact as well.In spite of all the good things, however, this one could've been much, much more, and I'd rate it worth one watch, no more. Home viewing will also do just fine. And oh, for those wondering about another comparison - I'll watching anything with Clint Eastwood in it, but this one's much better than 'Trouble with the curve'.",Null,1,6,9 May 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Cash-grab, nevertheless.....
","Well. I'm not sure how to review this, since it is incomplete. On purpose too. Just like they did it unnecessarily with 'Breaking dawn' (I know, barf), and since that model proved successful for Lionsgate, they've decided and done the same here. Something that would've made a powerful movie, 3 hours long, has been split into 2, around 2 hours each. While I do grant that this approach allows the characters to breathe, unfortunately, there isn't much material here to justify the split.Anyway, the rants can go on, but key decisions have been made, and the movie exists in this form, so there. The bold decision (by the author, not by the makers) was calling the series 'Hunger games' still, though the games ended with the last Quarter Quell that had some very unforeseeable (for us) consequences, that have brought the unrest between the Capitol and the districts into full-on war mode, in spite of all efforts by the Capitol to control the flow of information with all of their in- your-face propaganda (a not-so-clever metaphor for how all media is controlled by the real- world economies).We have to appreciate the aspect of the author preferring to focus on all the politicking that goes on in this context, and keeping us away from most of the action going on in the background (what the movie does, esp. this first part of the 3rd book, is something else entirely) and instead focusing on how our leads are exploited in the bargain, no quarters given.Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman (sadly no more) and JenLaw are all fantastic in their roles, and the casting director should be complimented. Donald Sutherland, at his age, is playing one of the most chillingly evil villains of all time, whilst being topical and relevant to us audiences as well, and once again, this is a job well done by casting, as well as the performer.Who absolutely stands out from everyone else, in spite of them being acting powerhouses, is Josh Hutcherson, who has undergone a transformation as chilling as the one Christian Bale underwent for 'The Machinist' (or even 'American Hustle'). He perhaps has the most difficult role of all, since this is a narrative with characters playing out deceptions-within-deceptions without the crutch of non- realistic scenarios, and his presence is almost more powerful than Sutherland's.There are a few instances where the makers show us snippets of what's going on outside of D13, and those sequences seem shoehorned in, but, from a narrative perspective, this movie holds together much, much better than most PG13 examples of YA novels being brought to life these days (think, 'Divergent', 'Maze runner' and the like). And remember the debt all these authors and film-makers HAVE TO pay to both 'Battle Royale' and 'Lord of the flies'. Unfathomable indeed, in spite of the fact that they seem to have done well in terms of quality, while not exactly treading new(er) ground.I'll still have to reserve my opinion until I see Part 2, but it makes sense that this one is a good quality addition in the series, as good as the 2nd one was (and that IS weird, since Gary Ross, who directed the first one, is more solid a film-maker than his successor, Francis Lawrence, who has nicely carved himself a niche-kinda position within the context or confines of this series).The technical aspects, as in the 2nd one (the first one was not as polished, IMO, though that might have been on purpose) are all top- notch, and I'm looking forward to how the sequences have been captured in the one coming next.All in all, I felt unlucky that this could could not be watched on IMAX, and would have loved to do that. Splitting this one might be costing the team 1/more Oscars as well, but they do get paid, and what's an Oscar worth, in any case, eh?",Null,14,24,2 December 2014
The Monuments Men," Low Key WWII caper
","Finally watched this one on the big screen today. Get why they moved it to Feb. It has all the right pieces, and is a serviceable piece of drama; but is a tad underwhelming (not in a bad way). In spite of that, this is very much up Clooney's alley as a filmmaker, and has him not just reuniting with Damon and Blanchett ('The good German'), but also bring along the reclusive Bill Murray, the Coens' Special John Goodman, and the extremely under-used Bob Balaban for the ride, along with Jean Dujardin (given short shrift here) and Hugh Bonneville. Clooney is not going for WWII epic (Damon should have some déjà vu watching the Normandy sequence, though we're never shown him land either in 'Saving..' or in this one) evidenced by his setting the tone multiple times during the flick, with no grandstanding or bravado diverting the mission-at-hand, though the clunky voice- over by his character feels shoehorned, and we could have done without it. Do I wish it had been more rousing, as more critics seemed to be expecting. Actually, no. Low-key is Clooney's style, and he's picked that up from Soderbergh, Corbjin and the like; and is his strength. There have been too many movies that go the epic route, and this is a welcome pace even for the genre itself, so that it doesn't feel tired and wear itself out (IMHO). All in all, a good time at the movies, but only for those who synchronize their expectations accordingly. And yes, on the big screen - the production design merits that.",Null,2,2,22 February 2014
The Finest Hours," When the goings get tough
","A few observations, based on 2 3D viewings, in Dolby Surround 7.1, on digital 3D screens.This movie is done a disservice by its marketing department, since it 'boasts' one of the most by-the-numbers trailers, which, thankfully, I did not let influence me, especially since the flick itself is engaging from beginning to end, and is a throwback to adventure/rescue movies of yore - think 'Das Boot', 'The perfect storm', 'White squall', 'All is lost', et al. It is also one of the recent movies where the 3D augments, and does not distract, or distort, of course, depending on whether the cinema you patronize maintains their projection and glasses in ship-shape or not.The meat of the screenplay revolves the main plot taking 3 paths after its 15 minute point, followed by long, slow, engaging peeks we get into each of those paths from that point on. Gillespie, of 'Lars and the real girl' and 'Fright Night' (remake) fame, brings his deft, sure touch to the proceedings, never allowing a single plot- point or character to take the main stage, but allowing the plot to be the movie's anchor, so to speak. One aspect that was kinda disappointing, as is always for me, is the based-on-a-true-story trope, which ensures that surprises will be at a minimum, except perhaps for those who have no idea with what happened off the port of Charleston (MA) in 1952 with the Pendleton and the MA Coast guard, or seasoned veterans of watching rescue mission movie plots unfold (or for those among us who read spoiler- laden reviews to be sure that we're watching stuff that others in the mainstream have praised). Chris Pine (his career-best?) and Casey Affleck (a really good year, with this one and 'Manchester by the sea' coming out), on (each of) whose shoulders is placed most of the leadership duties, acquit themselves very well, with each of their characters having well- defined arcs that begin at a point where they're treated like underdogs (in 1 case, deservedly so, while in another case, not so much), and quietly (yet surely) rise up to the occasion when called upon to do so. They're ably supported by Ben Foster (still the best thing about most of the movies he's been in - The messenger, Hostage, Lone survivor, Ain't them bodies saints, 3:10 to Yuma - remake, Contraband - remake of Reykjavik|Rotterdam......), Eric Bana (under-used, possibly miscast, but still damn good), Holiday Grainger (with an arc not as well-defined, but, considering the writing, she does a pretty credible job) and the other stock supporting characters, from among whom John Ortiz, as always, stands out. Along with the trailer, one more thing I thought was super-corny was the tag-line I saw on the poster, which said, 'We all live, or we all die'. However, in the context of the movie and the situations it covers, though spoiler-y, the adage is apt. A friend of mine had complaints about the sound design throughout, even through the character-making low noise sequences in the beginning, excessive use of miniatures and CGI etc. I do not see eye-eye on most of those, though he is more knowledgeable on some of the set design and situations having to influence sound design, even in which case, I'd be on Gillespie+Team's side for making choices needed to keep the movie stayed cinematic. It's a mainstream outing, after all, and I'm all for those outings that stay away from the Michael Bay school of quick cuts and edits (inspired, of course, by the master of those music video-inspired techniques, the late Tony Scott).Over time, and in hindsight, I also find myself disagreeing with most of the criticisms being leveled against the Holiday Grainger led path/arc, since it stayed true to the contexts set at the beginning of this flick. In conclusion, this is surely one to be viewed on the biggest screen possible, maybe more than once.",Null,1,5,9 February 2016
The Equalizer," What about Bob?
","Perhaps one of the most slickly done mainstream action movies out there, in a dying genre, that I recommend it on those genre-related merits alone, though it could've been done way, wayyyy better.The first hour spends time setting the main characters up, and that's the best part about this flick. Sadly, content-wise (that IS important to note here) its all downhill from that point on, and becomes a by-the-numbers vigilante's vendetta flick. Denzel's on call and the loneliness of his character is beautifully realized here, but that character is called upon to perform so many acts that are beyond the realm of suspension-of-disbelief, that few viewers have compared this one to Steven Seagal flicks (more on that later).What this movie has got going for it, in spades, is sheer style and chutzpah (a word grossly misused for effect in a recent overrated local flick). Each action set-piece is preceded by McCall- cam, borrowing, intentionally or not, from Guy Ritchie's rendering of Sherlock Holmes-cam, and that novelty factor, for most, wore out its welcome after the first time, though the technical effort expended whenever it is used is exemplary.The cinematography, and the soundtrack, is some of the best to grace the screen this year, and in the case of the latter, there is one track that fits a particular action set-piece so well, that its presence, along with its companion action sequence, almost redeemed the lazy Bollywood hi- jinks resorted to by the makers for most of its running time: Slo-mo focus on the lead, really???? We get it, but...really?There is also a point after which its not just the lead's invincibility that gets hammered into us, but also the inanity and the predictability of it all, that is only redeemed by the style on display.Antoine Fuqua, with this, has returned to 'The Replacement Killers' territory, which, though slick and technically proficient for its time, was equally plagued with every action cliché that acts as a checklist item for most of its ilk, though thankfully falling just short of corny 'Transporter' or 'Fast and Furious' territory. For that much effort, I'd gladly handle multiple viewings of movies like this rather than 'Transporter' or 'Fast and Furious'. His take-no-prisoners style also mirrors his approach in 'Olympus has fallen'. Coincidentally, Butler was also considered for the McCall role.I wish the movie had continued to include a key character, who precipitates everything that happens in this flick, throughout, rather than dispense with him/her, and then only bring him/her back at the end. I was like, 'Huh? Did I miss something?'Haley Bennett (Music & Lyrics) has a change of scene here, and acquits herself well. The spare, quick, brutal and realistic (for the most part) mano-a-mano fight sequences seem to be used Aikido moves for the most part, and this, more than anything else, perhaps has prompted a few viewers to make comparisons to Steven Seagull flicks after having watched this one. I wouldn't cover them all, but am sure that the final set-piece between Seagal and Tommy Lee Jones in 'Under Siege' was a definite inspiration of sorts to the action choreographer/director, and it is undeniably effective, and is a welcome technique.I'd watch this again, just to enjoy the set-piece I spoke of, and the cinematography + soundtrack, but still feel that the movie could've been better than what it turned out to be. I think there's the inevitable sequel coming, esp. since the box office for this has been decent, and hope they fix what needs fixing for that one at least.",Null,0,2,22 November 2014
John Wick," A reason to go on living
","One would think that the overarching theme of this flick would be redemption by revenge, at least from most of the murmurs I heard during/after the screening, as well as read online. However, no one redeems themselves here. Someone who's stopped living, and is trying to deal with loss, is given a cruel jolt to get back to in terms of life, and ironically, that living is made possible by killing. However, to quote an oft-repeated cliché, this time it's personal.This is almost like a step-child of movies that are in on the joke of sending genres up (like 'Shoot 'em up'), that it is extremely entertaining since it is done right, just the way that Clive Owen vehicle was, but as serious as those movies that are not self-aware of the genre (more on that ahead in this piece).Wick the character is so much in the shadows already by the time the movie begins, that one almost dreads it becoming a parody of itself, something that John Cusack or Nicolas Cage does, with bigger budgets and better (at least on paper) film-makers (Paul Schrader's making the latest Cage vehicle, that still might go DTV). To me, that is one of the major achievements of this particular flick - not succumbing to how easy it is to churn something out, and let it languish on a disc without making it cinema-worthy. First-time directors (one of them strangely uncredited) Chad Stahelski (listing those movies that seem to be close cousin of this one - stunt-work on Safe, Blitz, Faster, Ninja Assassin, Mr./Mrs. Smith, The Mechanic and Constantine - another reference for this coming up) and David Leitch (stunt-work on Ninja Assassin, The Bourne Legacy, Bangkok Dangerous, Mr./Mrs. Smith, The Mechanic, Constantine) make this genre their own, making us wish that they do more movies in this genre, in addition to quite possibly make a strong sequel, or series of sequels to this one.So many are gonna walk out remembering Reeves and the stunts on this one, and they'd be right too, but this one also needs to be remembered for how great Michael Nyqvist is, and he has not got such a meaty role since his turn in the original girl with the dragon tattoo. He has as many scenes as Reeves does, and is a strong presence throughout, taking care not to chew up the scenery (and he sure can), and evoking great memories of his fantastic final mano-a- mano fight in the parking garage with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt in 'Mission Impossible: Ghost protocol'. The fights in this one are a companion piece to that particular encounter, strange though it may sound.The always great gun-fu stunt-work is accompanied by impeccable production design, sumptuous cinematography and perfect metal soundtrack. Both the helmers and their lead's work on 'Constantine' seems to have given them the license to borrow liberally from both the look and some of the concepts in 'Constantine' (concept of neutral 'hotel' ground for assassins in this one was borrowed heavily, even placing Lance Reddick and Ian McShane in Djimon Hounsou's shoes). Speaking of comparisons, Adrianna Paclicki's assassin is as bad as Mireille Enos's assassin in 'Sabotage', and in a good way.Every stunt sequence is minimalist, blunt and brutal, doesn't go on for longer than it has to, and respects every stunt-performer. Each performer who takes a hit, in our eyes, is seen to feel the hit, even an explosion. That way, we see the damage actual violence does, and this could also make a great case for why is should not be used as a resort (though I'm not sure most would feel that way). This is how each action scene, no matter what the movie, should be composed and (ha ha) executed, otherwise it has the danger for not allowing the impact or consequence, to be felt.Look-wise, and action set-piece wise, this also has many things in common with both 'Payback' and 'Safe', and makes all of them look good, since the comparison is fair and complimentary. I still hold the other to be superior works, but this is high up there as well.Willen Dafoe and Lance Reddick could've been given more to do, and McShane shines in the 2 scenes he gets. Alfie Allen plays another d!ck here, and people who hate him from 'GOT' will be allowed to regurgitate those emotions here.In spite of the fact that the cuts to the gore and violence are minimal in the region I watched this in, the body that did said changes makes up for those omissions by posting a HUGE anti-smoking warning on screen, in bright white large CAPPED font (the movie's almost entirely dark, so you can imaging how we all had to squint during those sequences), that completely detracts from anything that might be happening on screen for the duration that any character lights up, or has a smoke in hand. Therefore, I will NOT recommend a local theatrical viewing, and instead suggest that this be viewed theatrically in regions that retain both the Rating as well as do not have on-screen diversions during its runtime.One more thing - the prologue, and the loopback to it, were completely unnecessary narrative potholes, IMO, though the post-loopback was kinda relevant and gratifying.",Null,1,14,16 November 2014
Lone Survivor," ..Heroes...Just for one day....
","Prolly the movie Peter Berg was born to make. Nah, it's defn not a classic. Save all those comparisons to 'Saving Private Ryan' (except for the action, perhaps) too, they're wasted on this. However, it has a great many good things going for it. The casting for one (regardless of the idiotic tell-all title). Finally, Taylor Kitsch gets a role he can be proud of (Is Berg atoning for 'Battleship'?) - he's in great form, and in good company for sure, with decent (as expected) turns from Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch as well. The terrain's as much a (-ve) character as are the Pashtun. Bana's little-seen, little- used, but effective as always. This is his second military rescue genre work after 'Black Hawk down'. Speaking of which, this one shares more with that, and with the far-far inferior 'Behind enemy lines' (which could've been better without the ham- fisted direction). The movie's one hell of a visceral experience, only to be had on the big screen, and I dare anyone not to flinch during the numerous sequences of nature-against-man violence wrought upon the 'survivors'. However, it does get a tad much (not belittling the plight of the lead/s, but more to do with a movie-making perspective), and a little subtlety would've helped, something like the less-is-more approach used by James Wan or William Friedkin. I also quite enjoyed the end-credits track by Peter Gabriel (Heroes) and the New Blood Orchestra(?). All in all, a decent watch, but its being extremely overrated by people who don't know better.",Null,0,2,7 February 2014
Fury," War never ends.....period
","'All sound and fury, signifying nothing'. Yep, that's war, no matter where it's fought, no matter who wins, no matter what they win, and no matter who they butcher doing all that.I'd like to believe that Ayer had that thought while making this one, which I consider his best to date, at least in terms of ambition, of not in terms of execution as well (I'm in his corner, but many don't seem to be).If you wanna watch the horror of war, and feel it hit you over the head and smell the mud and the grime and become numb at the end of it, and still wanna talk about it, trying to make sense of it all, while staying anti-war, this movie achieves that remarkable feat.A respected friend, in his/her critique, called this clichéd and predictable, and I think it is a little bit of both, in parts, but never loses sight of the human tale it tells, even during the final relentless set-piece that doesn't seem to have an end.Of course, harsher people have called this the worst ending in years, and I think they missed the point completely, just as they're sure to have missed the point of the clean-up-and-sup sequence that serves to take us (and mainly, the ravaged characters, who have been through a lot, and have nothing better to look forward to) away from the relentless (there's that word again) brutalities and atrocities of war (and its inevitable fallout), if just for a few moments. In that scene, you completely understand what the main characters want, have been through, and are about. Sadly, the main point missed by most audience-members (it's okay - at least they paid to watch the flick and then make their observations - the movie deserved that much).Every performance, be it the lead (not Pitt) Lerman, or Shia LaBeouf (surprisingly, almost cast against type - imagine the kinda lobbying he and his agent would have had to do to land him this gig), Bernthal (apparently channeling his 'Shane' from 'The Walking Dead' according to some ignoramus who thought he/she could understand what characterization is all about), Peña (always solid, but not given much room over here) or (unsurprisingly) Pitt is grounded in the conflict, and you believe that these men have been serving together as long as they have, and bond as easily as they do. I also cannot get enough of watching Jason Isaacs perform, and he's in 2 whole scenes in this one. I don't think his talents are being utilized the way they ought to be. One of the best sequences, for me, was the infamously derided clean- up-and-sup sequence, and it is so contextual and plausible that I am even more surprised at audience reactions, and wonder what some people expect from a work of fiction. It's almost as though no one has heard of artistic liberty at all, when it comes to this flick, but all the liberties taken by other mainstream flicks are alright. Separate rules indeed!I also got diverted by all the talk (to be fair, I've heard only 1 opinion on the subject so far) on how there were no tracer bullets in WWII. I confess I found it to be slightly distracting initially, and gave the movie-maker the benefit of doubt thereafter, but the one who accompanied me said he was completely out of it all after he saw that, and the movie made no impact on him at all. So it's possible that the other audience-members who felt differently found their own (or the same) points due to which they felt no longer involved in the movie-watching experience for this one. IMHO, they missed a good one.A good time at the movies this weekend - definitely to be enjoyed on the biggest screen possible.",Null,0,4,5 November 2014
The Maze Runner," Lose yourself
","While I do wish this had more to do with the maze than it ultimately ended up being about, and while I wish it had more Patricia Clarkson, those are extremely little nits to pick in an otherwise smooth adaptation of the James Dashner novel.One of the reasons this is such a compelling watch, is a combination of pitch-perfect casting and superior-though-short-of-being-award-worthy performances. The young cast, of whom the only known face (other than Clarkson) to me was Thomas Brodie-Sangster ('Jojen' from 'Game of Thrones'), and another kid (Will Poulter) that plays a (kinda) antagonist within the setting so to speak, who most of us would remember from 'Son of Rambow', 'Narnia 3' and 'We're the Millers' (his physical comedy in that one did evoke peals of laughter in the audience, in spite of most of it being of the juvenile variety, and that's not easy to pull off, regardless of it appearing commonplace). The lead should be known to the TV- watching American audience, since he's more famous for 'Teen Wolf', and suits the role to a T.Much has also been written about the production design that gives the surroundings a suitable, lived-in feel, and that works in building and maintaining the atmosphere of the setting. However, I, for one, felt that this world was not as explored as it could've been, with quite a few holes in the narrative being unexplored/unexplained. However, that would be a quirk of the written word vs the screenplay, since the novel did have its plot set in stone, and Wes Ball and the crew quite possibly decided to stick to it rather than experiment like the way 'Game of Thrones' has been doing, albeit with the support of its prolific (ha, ha) author. Suffice to say that while I did notice that the narrative did not take as many chances with the material as it could have, I was saved from having that feeling while watching the cinematic events unfold, since the editing et al keeps things moving at a fairly decent pace that these become nits to pick only while writing the review, not otherwise. And that IS a compliment, albeit a little backhanded one.They also gave away more of the back-story than I expected they would, and the taste it leaves is one of intrigue and just enough curiosity for us to check out the subsequent movies in this trilogy.Wish I'd had the opportunity to watch this in the format it's been converted to - Barco Escape, but that's an experiment being carried out only in the US for now, and that too across 5 cinemas only, overall. Hopefully, sometime soon. All in all, a good watch at the cinema this weekend.",Null,0,1,21 September 2014
Zootopia," Definitely not standard-issue
","Well, the trailers did make it seem assembly line like. Surprise, surprise: this one's got heart, and brains, to boot...And it does help that its themes are as timely and topical as the ones espoused in the Pixar master-work, 'Wall-E'.Watched this one on(L)I(e)max 3D. Good projection, decent seating, 3D experience worth the surcharge. I think the predominant theme underlying the entire take is the prevalence of prejudices, preconceived notions, and how characters with heart (read, courage) can overcome those and see the truth lying beneath, whether/not they want to see it. Now, though I'm gonna point out my disappointment with the flick, I feel the intent deserves points on its own (which its sure raking up at the box office). Gotta make that reference once again here - this one's almost as ambitious as the masterful 'Wall-E', albeit more in terms of intent rather than content. If only....Now, this movie does many things right, in terms of putting us in the middle of an unfolding tale of an ambitious underdog- type (typical mainstream movie trope, disappointingly so, imho), who, for all intents and purposes, is our window into this alternate universe where humans don't figure (an interesting question actually..are we extinct in 'Zootopia'?). To me, answering that question would have made for a far more interesting movie, but that's a separate topic.Now, most of the entire movie is curiously framed as a buddy cop mystery scenario (another trope used both in mainstream cinema and in Indies, perhaps to better effect in the latter), & that might put a few people off, especially those who've seen this scenario better explored in superior movies ('Kiss kiss bang bang' comes to mind, and 'Lethal Weapon' while it was still fresh - both having Shane Black in common), who've been expecting something different here. The voice-work by named actors is pretty good, and Jason Bateman proves that he pretty much owns anything he's in, even if he's given cheesy lines for an endearing character, but one who's bogged down by utter predictability.But, for me, the lack of anything substantial, and the main plot just taking off a few minutes before it's curtains was the most disappointing thing of all, in addition to, payoffs bring undeserved as well as underserved, along with comeuppances being unearned too (my comparisons? Most Pixar works using the Lasseter name, including the reviled 'Brave'). The McGuffin used, I'd perhaps one of the weakest ever.The movie also goes fully bland mainstream in the selection of its color palette, 3d and musical score choices. To me, that smacked of studio interference at many junctures. Even the mainstream trope thrills don't really pump adrenaline that most Pixar works are known to (Finding Nemo, Incredibles, the aforementioned Wall-E, the inferior Cars and Brave......). To me, the condition and execution of the action set- pieces was borderline bland, as was the villain and the motivation, and the supremely disappointing/underwhelming denouement.Keeping all the negatives listed above in perspective, I find it curious that this one's getting a heavy push from RT etc. though it's not in Pixar league, in spite of some pedigree.And what's Idris Elba doing this year in every Disney flick - this one, 'Jungle Book' and 'Finding Dory'.Also, this one gets a day-date release here, while the (apparently) superior Kung fu Panda 3 might make it's easy here only after a month? Something's not right.Could have been really great. A huge missed opportunity, imho.But - the scene with the Sloths at the DMV, is w0rth the price of admission.",Null,2,13,5 March 2016
The Babadook," Forty Winks
","Never thought this one would get a theatrical release locally. Having said that, the only cinema in one of the places I stay at playing this one disappointed me by canceling the showing (and not intimating us long distance commuters since we don't matter) the first time I tried watching it. Undeterred, I tried catching another one at a different city where I am staying for work, and this time the screening went off without a hitch, albeit in a small size cinema. First off, the color palette used in the final product was quite evocative of another good attempt in this genre - The Conjuring. Muted colors mostly, and though I am NOt a fan of things being done for effect, the quality of the movie-making on this one was so high that I (kinda) ignored that reference.Also, lest I forget while waxing eloquent on all the +s in this one, the artwork inherent in this, while also being used as an inventive narration technique, is very evocative of the superb work done on 'Coraline'. And that IS a compliment, and not meant to criticize. Also, to me, this was also evocative of one of the best entries in this genre, the Hollywood remake of 'Dark Water' (know by the same name as well), in which Jennifer Connelly led one of the best mom-daughter casts in a movie that was nothing short of perfect.Now, to the best parts: - Performance all round, but esp. the leads, Essie Davis and Noah Wisemen knock it outta the park. Each performance complements the other, as do their characters, and there are so many difficult portions that are completely embraced by both, that it is easy to see why this one is gaining accolades throughout. Both are Oscar-worthy turns, and I do hope someone (anyone) takes that into account come awards season. - The technical aspects, esp. the soundtrack, and the cinematography, almost are the supporting characters in this, as they ought to be on any genre entry worth the expense. In spite of the fact that this genre has been done to death (pun most deffo intended), having those 'jump' scares that still have the potential to make one, ehrm, 'jump', is nothing short of an achievement. That it does so creatively even, while foreshadowing said moments, is truly spectacular. That they are tied together by some truly subtle yet omnipresent editing makes the attention to detail all the more praiseworthy, and yes, award-worthy too. - I have referenced 'Dark Water', and that is the only element that could qualify as a spoiler going into this one, though in spite of that, this is still very much its own movie, and I still did not see the ending coming. Beautiful, perhaps one of the best endings I've had the pleasure of watching unfold in a long time yet.However, it's not all perfect, and some portions in the movie do not hold up to the scrutiny that I subjected the plot to, based on how it decides to wind up, and that's a pity, along with the fact that a key horror element would almost make one laugh out loud at the movie (and it did that at multiple points when it reared it's kinda ugly head, taking the ones who were seriously engrossed completely out of the flick), instead of with the movie, and that was kinda unexpected (and disappointing) in an otherwise perfect effort.All in all - a great time at the movies. Go watch it at the nearest multiplex before the mainstream juggernauts gobble up that slot.",Null,1,7,21 December 2014
Point Break," Extremely loud, incredibly close
","Forget the badly converted 3d, forget most of the bad acting (paycheck time for Winstone and Lindo, with only Ramirez walking away with his dignity intact) forget that this was already remade into the Fast & Furious franchise successfully. Okay?Now, for fans of traveling, extreme sports, and good cinematography, this work of art (yep!) is just what the doctor ordered.Except for the set piece involving rolling trucks and stone-alanche, each set piece has been meticulously constructed and executed, specifically the rock climbing one putting all of Took Cruise's real life/real time antics pale by comparison, and the ones on snow capped mountains and in the sea.There's also a pretty decent twist that occurs quite a while ahead of the dual climax that might seem satisfying to some, and that's perhaps a bonus.In conclusion:Ericson Core can shoot action...watch this on the biggest 2d screen you can find...",Null,2,5,6 January 2016
The Natural," Dated melodrama, yet 'Let's play ball'
","The structure of the movie, an amalgam of a little mystery and misdirection at the beginning withing the trappings of a true-to- life sports drama, might throw off some viewers, but worked for me, gradually over the movie's runtime. In fact, that's perhaps one of the things that did not seem dated, in terms of narrative at least (again, gradually stretching over the movie's substantial runtime). I confess to getting restive with the flashback cuts in the beginning, which, in hindsight, was essential, and perhaps the perfect way to introduce everything. The choice made about how the filmed ending differed from the book its based on, to me, smacked of being one of those choices a mainstream filmmaker typically makes, a feel-good cop-out. I'm sure the movie would have withstood the passage of time better if they had stuck to the tone of the book, but for those who're unfamiliar with the written work, this should work just fine.Kim Basinger plays the moll as she knows how, and though her character's trajectory is unsurprising on the whole, casting did matter, and perhaps the overall effect is better for that. Robert Duvall, almost always great in his everyman-playing career, in this flick, has to have played the most despicable character (not surprising, since it hits close to the scruples held by a true-to- life media-person) in his career ever as Max Mercy (observe his drawings in a key sequence, and his own rationale of his place of power in the baseball-playing world, completely undeterred when another key character wants to tear down what he does - he Never Backs Down, in spite of us hating him, not 1 inch), along with an uncredited Darren McGavin (Mike Hammer from late-50s TV - mroe on him in a bit). I've never been a fan of Glenn Close, but respect her talent, and in this one, she does what she needs to, although her portion lends itself to some muted melodrama that gains some traction as her portion increases its relevance to the overall plot. The best part is the one performed by the uncredited Mike Hammer himself, McGavin. A veteran of TV and the silver screen, the entire movie is elevated due to what he brings to the filmed work, and the 1 scene in which he and Redford's character trade-off one-upmanships is a treat to behold (and the other scenes in which they play off one another). One of the more menacing antagonists, always lurking in the shadows, and more powerful in the dark.Wilford Brimley due his thing, and it's always a nice thing to watch him in play. The raggedy old bear who we slowly grow to like, with his tough exterior also softening over the course of the movie's running-time is perhaps one of the oldest clichÃ©s in the book, but not such a bad thing with a master like Brimley bringing him to life.Redford doesn't have to stretch much like a few of the other roles he'd tackled in his past, but he puts in his efforts, and they do bear fruit - doesn't get a note wrong. All in all, in spite of most of the material being dated, and the cop-out of an ending, this one's still a better-than-good watch - we'd do even better to watch it with like-minded aficionados on the big screen, given the opportunity.",Null,0,2,12 October 2014
The Hateful Eight," The Lincoln Letter
","First, you gotta watch this one the big screen, preferably the one with the overture, 12 minutes longer runtime, and the 12 minute intermission. Old. School.Second, you're unlucky if you live in a scissor-happy society, like I do.So, in spite of that, I trudged to the local cinema, a screen little bigger than the average home cinema, with a good friend, and proceeded to try and enjoyed what was left of the movie.All actors are phenomenal in their roles, a testament not just to their acting talent, but also to their recognition as such, and the casting that the writer/director did, at the time of conceiving the flick.This also has to be one of the best scored Ennio Morricone movies, ever, and I do hope he gets the Oscar statuette he so deserves. This guy's been scoring for years now, and most of his work has been iconic, including Sergio Leone's 'Man with no name' trilogy in the 60s, all the way to this one. It's definitely been 1 heck of a journey.Unlike what some have been saying, the twists that begin playing out in one of the final acts, spanning over the last hour/so, is kept grounded, and is all the more impactful for that, not just due to the (Tarantino-esque) bloodletting and gore that happens, even though there's less of that locally. Also, I did not get to hear most of the colorful language spouted by typical Tarantino characters, and my impression of the movie is still a good one in spite of everything (sigh).Most of the players are those who've worked with QT earlier (Sam L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Zoë Bell, James Parks, Dana Gourrier...with Roth and Madsen almost re-living the g(l)ory days of their being Reservoir Dogs?), but the one who's been given a plum character with one of the strongest arcs ever put to film has to be that belonging to (his new male muse?) Walton 'Justified' 'Shield' Goggins, and I've been waiting for this actor to sink his teeth into a meaty role like the one he's been gifted by QT in this master-work. Demián Bichir, Bruce Dern (shame on you if his filmography is new: 'Nebraska', 'Last man standing', 'Silent Runnings', 'Coming home', 'After dark, my sweet', 'The cowboys' and many, many more....) and other new actors to QT's table also acquit themselves perfectly, with the first actor who's really good in almost anything he does, hidden behind one hell of a beard and accent (but is good nonetheless). Another character with one hell of an arc belongs to one among a total of 4 female characters in the movie (at least the one with most run-time among them), enacted by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and this has to be one of the best performances this actress has ever given, in spite of the fact that her repertoire (not of late, sadly) has included some of the toughest female characters ever committed to film. She's more than up to this task, and completely owns every frame she's in, and due to the unpredictability of what she might do, even whenever she's with the mighty ensemble, our eyes stay riveted on her actions, kinda like waiting for the other shoe to drop, to describe the whole situation mildly.The photography by Robert Richardson (Hugo, Inglourious Basterds, Shutter Island, Django unchained, Kill Bill, U Turn, A few good men, JFK, Platoon - for my money, the greatest living DOP we have, and I'm so looking forward to his upcoming work in Ben Affleck's adaptation of Dennis Lehane's 'Live by night') has to be some of the best ever committed to film, and wish this one had had an IMAX version of sorts ( that I'd got to watch the roadshow theatrical version sometime). This deserves multiple viewings, on the biggest screen there is. Now, obviously, this is a QT movie, so it is not for those with weak stomachs. Seriously. Even the chopped version, since what's in your head, during those missing frames, might actually be worse than how it was actually filmed. I still do not know how it was actually filmed, and while that's not a good thing, I'm sure you get my drift. If ppl wanna judge this work of art based on the violence (and the language, and the threat of violence, and the feigned violence...) that they (get to) see, or not, on the big screen, obviously, they're welcome to, but, if that's their sole focus, they might just be missing the entire point of this subliminal work of QT's which, for all its obvious, and almost childishly gleeful pretentiousness (the title cards tout this being QT's 8th work...really, QT? Like we wouldn't know already?..anyhoo) ranks among the best he's ever done. Plus, all the racist slurs against both African-Americans and Latin-Americans seem, to me, to be intended to portray the period as it must have been, warts and all, though a case might be made for overuse of various slurs. Long story short, in my humble opinion, everything that is there in the flick seems intended to propel the narrative and not for any other self- effacing reason, though the case has been made by most QT haters that its the latter and not the former.This one harks back to his writing for 'Inglourious Basterds', closer to that spiritually, than anything else QT has ever done, perhaps with a sprinkling of 'Django Unchained', which is still being underrated by most, especially since '12 years a slave' released in a neighborly fashion. However, I can't help feeling that he might have been in a hurry to wrap things up, a feeling I did not ever get during 'IB', perhaps since I watched that the way it was meant to be viewed, on glorious XD, show after show after show....",Null,2,8,19 January 2016
Moana," Giving back
","From the minds of 'The princess & the frog', 'Aladdin' & 'Hercules', among others, this is quite an experience for an animated movie that sadly fell apart on reflection. Make no mistake, this is pure entertainment for all ages, especially the beginning part with little Moana, her namesake supporter, & her grandma, but all of that only lasts for the duration of the movie. Works best if you do not look for reasons to various occurrences in the events that transpire over its runtime. 'You're welcome' was a royal hoot, and I did enjoy both renderings of the song. Wasn't very fond of the cliché-ridden plot line though, & there are plenty of examples where I thought the movie could have used fresh ideas, especially during the writing stage/phase of the flick. Disney sure dropped the ball, imho, on this one. The 3D rendering is gorgeous, and a Real D 3D viewing experience is a must (if not IMAX 3D). Surprisingly, Dwayne Johnson's voice is not a distraction at all, and his voice-casting is as apt as Jermaine Clement's voice-casting as the middle-person crab. The characters playing the lead's sidekicks (2) should have had more runtime, imho, along with the segment with the younger version of the lead. Not enough at all. Quite possibly few of the best sequences occur with them in tow. Along with the sequences with the crab, the ones in the cave, and 1 on the island, but, imho, the movie peaked early, and underwhelms towards the end. This kind of a problem has afflicted other better movies, & I, for one, feel that these kind of problems need to be visualized at the scripting stage (I'm sure they were, just not sure about the extent to which it was done, or about the final sign-off from the execs) itself, considering the amount of time that is spent on these productions. Another recent movie, 'Dear Zindagi', did not have a 'hook' compelling enough for someone like me to invest in the fate of the lead characters, & though this one does not falter as much as that one did, it sure comes close. Worth 1 viewing. Decent, but way short of greatness, in spite of the potential it had to be another 'Frozen' or a 'Big Hero 6'.",Null,6,21,4 December 2016
Begin Again," 'Twice' a charm
","It's bin a while since I've seen a full-blown Indie musical. This one qualifies, even though it's no more than a re-tread of Carney's far-superior 'Once'. I've been meaning for the team behind 'Once' to do something together, and create that magic once again (pun definitely intended), but I did not mean for Carney to take that this literally and self-cannibalize his own work.To be kind to all those involved in the making though, I'll have to say that this one's a spiritual sibling to that masterpiece, with some great music, which still pales in comparison to the original.Lonely once/never-successful leads? Check. One of the characters selling out/involved with someone selling out? Check. Good music, a combo of something eclectic and Indie, as well as a couple of commercial numbers? Check. Hand-held cams? Check. A bunch of small-timers rallying around our leads when needed? Check. An unconventional way to make an album? Check. And many more comparisons to 'Once'? Check, check check....Not mentioning certain spoilers about the lead pair's chemistry and eventual denouement.In spite of all that, I'm sure many haven't seen 'Once', and for them, this work will be a revelation - it'll be like a breath of fresh air.For me, the take-aways were Mark Ruffalo's ever-dependable acting chops, and some of the candor that went into the writing. Knightley's alright, Keener and Steinfeld are wasted (not literally, the alcoholic part of it is left to Ruffalo's character). What was surprising to me is the turn made by Adam Levine (Maroon 5) in a role that's almost like a callback to his real-life character, exposing the non-Indie music industry's shallowness with a viciousness that must've struck close to home for someone like him, and it was refreshing to see him tackle it with gusto, and like I said, it's really weird too.Definitely worth a watch, on the big screen, esp. when I did not expect it to be releasing locally at all (it's playing in the smallest multiplex screen for 1 show/night for 1 week, so there). Go watch it.",Null,1,3,3 August 2014
Closer," Far away, so close / How Closer do you really wanna get?
","Based on the play, this is a movie about how each one of us damages the other, to the point where any repair is impossible, and the scars never heal. Ostensibly simple in plotting and characterization, layer-after- layer is peeled off with each new interaction one of the 4 characters has with the other, and we understand their motivations, their grief, their hurt and the depth of their wounds, some of which are still open and festering, encouraged by the attitude of the wounded, who, unbeknownst to them, perhaps even revel in the festering of the same. This is how movies should be made. This is a fine example of all players being in the top of their form, and playing off each other as well. Nastiness oozes from everyone, and no punches are pulled.Popcorn-munchers beware, you might bite your tongue off if you're not careful while watching this movie. This is how real people talk to one another, when they're hurt and in pain. This is how we hurt one another, and expect that we're not hurt in turn, but life has its way of making sure everyone falls. This is how people are when they're alone, when they reject someone, when they get rejected, when they're depressed, alone. Some amazing direction from Mike Nichols (Silkwoood, Carnal knowledge, Catch-22, Wolf, The Birdcage - but this most closely resembles the fierce and exemplary work he did on 'Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf) make the characters deeply fleshed out and the players (Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and Julia Roberts) make them come alive with a zeal on display that depicts their complete knowledge of how powerful they think each of their characters is, and even a flick of an eyebrow is done with a delicious relish. Another great thing is the soundtrack initially belting out 'The Blower's daughter' by Damien Rice. Perfect accompaniment to a perfect movie.",Null,0,2,3 February 2007
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," One of those sequels.....read on
","Well. Everyone knows that Marvel just keeps getting more+more confident with each outing, growing, as it were, and expecting the audiences to keep up, albeit in a friendly, safe manner. This will make big bucks, and is a worthy addition to the franchise that spawns 'Avengers' as well. The action sequences are great, and are very engrossing. Almost hypnotically so. It was not the same in the first part. This one has more of an 'Avengers' feel to the action, esp. with all the intensity inherent. Joss Whedon has done something right, by inspiring the rest to follow suit, the way it should be.They said its mostly actual action and stunt work, with as minimal CGI as possible, and I believe that. That's what augments most of the action sequences and makes them as intense as they are. The Falcon's a welcome addition to the team, and acquits himself well, with Mackie bringing his brand of charm to the role.This is perhaps the best example of a movie where converted 3D looks absolutely fantastic, and enhances the movie-going experience. I still am a fan of movie being shot in native 3D, but hell, this one comes close.The Easter eggs were great, though too few and far between. Do stay for the end of both the main credits as well as all credits. The main credit payoff is...interesting. I do have grouses though, and this is a big, big realm for some major spoilers, so beware: The point of bring a character back from the dead has never seemed this dull. No arc, no twist, and no payoff. The one who does have a major arc is Cap, and everything else seemed shoehorned in around him, not necessarily a bad thing. Hawkeye is majorly conspicuous by his absence. They should have cast a different actor if Renner didn't wanna do it. I do wonder how this ties in to the TV show that's ongoing. A major character in there, resurrected, is conspicuous by his/her complete absence. Another aspect I wanna call bullshit on.The bad guys are not evil enough, or menacing enough, and all the talk about 70s crime thriller feel to this is just that, talk. Redford brings his usual gravitas to his role, but he's done far, far better. A lot of the plot that happens in the first hour doesn't stand up to the usual critical autopsy one does after watching something popular, and that's disappointing, because this could've been truly great.Gonna watch it on IMAX tomorrow, and I'm lookin' fwd to it.",Null,3,7,4 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Chosen by a thinking relic
","Cumber-fans rejoice! Holmes, nee, Strange, is finally here. Pulling double duty as both the titular superhero (of sorts) and the baddie (unfortunately, they do world-eaters again, notwithstanding the sequel the F4 a few years previously)'s voice, Cumberbatch is perfect in every frame in this huge foray of his, into mainstream cinema (notwithstanding 'The 5th estate' or 'The imitation game', not counting his supporting turns in flicks like 'Tinker tailor soldier spy'). Enough about the actors though. Suffice to know that Mads Mikkelsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg (apt, but under-utilized, just like he was in 'Arrival') and the ever-fantastic Tilda Swinton (almost walks away with the entire movie), & even Scott Adkins, refreshingly being seen in something that's not gonna go direct-to- TV) are all perfectly cast in their respective roles, & acquit themselves admirably. Now, from a Marvel stable standpoint, this is supposed to be the beginning, of a sort, being the 2nd movie in their slate of Phase 2 flicks, which is supposed to have begun with Ant-Man last year. The new crop is supposed to include the titular character here, Ant-Man (of course), Black panther (see in Civil war), the 2nd-time rebooted Spiderman, Captain Marvel, while phasing out, subtle/explicitly the older crop of heroes (Iron Man, Cap, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, et al). This one does things most mainstream superhero movies haven't done, including those of the Marvel crop, in spite of Thor, haven't done. Mystical realms, timeloops, multiverses, planet/world gobblers et al. While staying true to the genre, within the confines of being an origin story of a new-age superhero, albeit with a whole chunk of mysticism and sorcery thrown in. Scott Derrickson, who's made unconventional (still mainstream) horror/thriller work including 'Sinister' and the underrated/under- viewed 'Deliver us from evil' (not the documentary), in spite of the flat/underwhelming remake of 'The day the Earth stood still', proves he's more than just apt, or even adept, at playing with all the moving parts he's been handed by the marvel that's team Marvel (mainly the writers). Marvel seems to be hell-bent to better every movie they've made with their next work, including hiring unconventional directors to helm them, beginning with Joss Whedon's selection for the 1st 'Avengers' flick, to SD here, and James Gunn on the GotG flicks (which remain the best Marvel works to date, in my book). There are, of course, the mandated/necessary nods to the other heroes present in this world, that still revolves around NYC, though it makes more than just 1 non-Sokovia like stop across countries, increasing scope to a level hitherto unseen. The converted 3D is terrific, and this needs to be fully appreciated on large format 3D screens alone. Michael Giacchino outdoes himself on the scoring front, though it is not comparable to other great, original works he's done. Apt. The technical team excels, as they're wont to do, in movies of this scale and size, and all their efforts are available for everyone to enjoy. The movie also dumbs down its high-concept storytelling, so that noobs to both Marvel and Inception-like imagery, or timeloops, can also have a good time at the movies. A few chase sequences are simply spectacular, though, for me, the conclusion (not including the 2 post end-title sequences) underwhelmed, and brought back bad memories of F4:Silver surfer.There's a heady mix of humor inherent in almost every serious sequence in the flick, which kind of enhances the entertainment quotient in the overall viewing experience, though not all the jokes land as they should (Wong's response to a quip at the end, which was intended to be ironic, I'm sure, is an example). There are quite a few clichés, and this movie might just have been a notch or two higher without them. I did wish they'd spent more time exploring exactly how the mystic realms connect to one another, the actual history behind how Dormammu became Dormammu (his true/initial identity, a la, something similar in the 'Deathstalker' books by Simon Green), more characters within, more explanations for why certain minions appear at will and disappear when convenient, but one cannot have it all. A few of the digital effects harkened back to the much-reviled 'Green lantern' movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that they conceptualized/executed most of it nevertheless.Having said that, I do think this is an absolutely fantastic effort, and hope to enjoy the sequel better, along with observing Strange's interactions with other heroes in the Marvel multiverse.",Null,0,1,6 December 2016
Interstellar," The 6th dimensional blight
","This, is not just another sci-fi movie on release out there, it's an experience, best felt+experienced+enjoyed on the largest screen possible, and from the best seat in the house. As everyone (not just us so-called nerds) knows by now, this is neither a sequel, nor a prequel, nor a remake, or a book adaptation. It is something completely original, that Nolan and his brother have crafted, a la 'Inception' and others of its ilk. It has its sources of inspiration, sure - what original work doesn't? Reason enough to be in its corner, and cheer for it surely? For me, sure, everything works that way, but one ticket never makes the difference. And no matter what you finally feel about the flick, there will be no denying that this glorious spectacle is one of those small coming-of-age (albeit in an accelerated fashion for some - heh heh) dramas, with sci-fi as the backdrop in a scarily plausible dystopian future. Nolan movies are best served without knowing much going in the first time, followed by trying to dissect what you learnt earlier when you watch the same flick a 2nd, a 3rd and a 4th time (that's how many viewings it took me to enjoy 'Inception', and I intend to do the same with this one, in spite of.....). However, since I already have the information on that you need to read this at your own risk, I will say this much, and it might qualify as a bona-fide spoiler for this - until the final 20 minutes or so, I thought this one was one of the best examples of an original masterpiece I'd ever had the pleasure of viewing. Something happens at the 2 hr. 25 minute (or so) mark that was such a huge WTF moment for me (clue: Inception 'Ghost'ing), and took me completely out of the movie, Kip Thorne (did he really buy into that?????) or not. I did get back and remained engaged through the rest of the tale, but the damage (yes, damage) was done. I really do not know why the makers decided this kind of a pre-denouement, but it surely is their right to decide where it goes, and take a few artistic liberties, without having to explain themselves to every second- guessing fan out there, and yours truly belongs only to that tribe for now, and doesn't need more pandering. Fo sho, that segment will divide audiences, and perhaps influence its box-office take as well.Still, it has to be appreciated that Nolan boldly went where only a few have gone before (in making mind-over-matter kinda cinematic experiences), and got a huge studio to fund this (to be fair, the movie was gonna be made, albeit with a different helmer - Steven Spielberg, that Jonathan Nolan was working with, alongside Kip Thorne). There are quite a few (let's call them) geniuses who (almost always) complain about the toggling aspect ratio due to the IMAX sequences. I used to feel sorry about what they were missing (IMAX cameras used for filming those sequences), but feel now that they do not deserve any more than what they get to watch - on a non-IMAX screen, or worse, at home on TV. They surely are welcome to wallow in their (collective?) ignorance, and I won't waste more time trying to extol the (not- Lie)IMAX experience.There are a few others, in a similar vein, who were un(der)appreciative of Hans Zimmer's score. It's brilliant. It's epic/sweeping/resplendent. It does evoke memories of scores in movies like 'Inception', but only in a favorable manner. Few people have even complained about missing dialogs in certain sequences due to a combination of score and sound-design. I did not have the same experience, and understood every word being spoken, and English is not even my native tongue. I want a copy of the theme already, the same way I went and bought my CD of the 'Inception' score when that one was on release.Big screen only. 70mm IMAX only. More than once. Even if you hate where the film-makers go towards the end.",Null,0,0,10 November 2014
American Sniper," Persuading the chair
","Well, I'm a huge fan of Eastwood, and had begun digging his work more so after he began directing. And to forgive an old man his eccentricities, I probably even stood up for him even after he talked to the chair at the last big RNC shindagig. But, and to be fair, if one had thought that the stupidly titled 'Lone survivor' had something of a 'right' slant in terms of being pro-war and unabashedly gung-ho in terms of its (misplaced?) patriotism when it came out (I was one of those people who thought that), that movie doesn't have anything on this. Another question that sometimes sprang in my mind, especially watching the initial 'conditioning' sequences, was if Eastwood himself was doing a 'Colbert' on us, and STO'ing (stating-the-obvious) on the evolution of the American soldier (and mercenary). Unapologetic about its pro-war message, which, I'm sure, has as much to do with the 'original' work it was based on, about the 'legend' with the most number of confirmed sniper kills, Chris Kyle, this movie is completely underwhelming from start-end, and not just because of its completely predictable, by-the-numbers storyline and unimaginative screenplay, but also due to the fact that there is simply no arc of any kind, with the supporting actors just standing in and playing obeisance to the 'legend' on play throughout, just serving as those hangers-on in local mainstream flicks that have no other role than to just egg our hero on, waxing (once again, unimaginatively) eloquent about how great he is, or how great his deeds are, to anyone who'll listen. Cases in point - the sequence on the rooftop during the sandstorm, the VA guy meeting near a concession stand, Sienna Miller's final scene gratefulness on the 'legend' coming back to them (which goes completely against the grain of what her character stood for in quite a few of the earlier sequences - in her defence though, it might have been pages being filled from real life, but Eastwood has been a better film- maker than this cookie-cutter work testifies). It also doesn't help that the key characters involved in the conditioning of the 'legend', his father and his brother (not directly, but by being his enabler of sorts) , and discarded ruthlessly as and when Eastwood needed that. Now, my question - if that was a decision of sorts, perhaps to make this more film-able, then why wasn't more attention paid to the so-called tense action sequences. There have been better examples of wartime movie-making, stuff like 'Black hawk down' or (shudder) 'Behind enemy lines' and the like. For someone who made the haunting 'Letters from Iwo Jima', this is a huge come-down, and I am not getting the decision made to even decide to film this one- note piece. Having said that, Cooper gives it his all, and though it (ideally) should not overshadow any of the other best actor nominations out there, it is a good, sincere effort from him, and he's saddled by the burden of not being given more scope in order to showcase his talents more. It was also disappointing that his supporting roles were just mainstream tropes and not much else. I have been vocally supportive of Eastwood's directorial work before, including lesser works like 'True crime', 'Blood work' and 'Changeling', but cannot support his work on this, or even his motivation to choose this as his directorial vehicle. This is the man that made 'Unforgiven', and even one of my favorite movies of all time (A perfect world), and he's telling us that he couldn't get even a smidgen of that angst into this movie, regardless of the book it was based on? Come on. Maybe I might have felt different if I were American, but I'm not too sure that makes a difference on appreciating a work of art.",Null,5,21,17 January 2015
American Hustle," Good, but they've all made better
","Watched this on a large screen last weekend. Liked it, but not over-the-moon for it, like most critics have been. Might be due to missing a couple of plot-points, but hey, I think Russell/Bale/Cooper have made better. That being said, it's probably the best release in months (not counting '..Llewyn...', of course.Starting off, right from the beginning, the movie became meta, not in a good way, where attention was being called to Bale's physical characteristics. It seemed more like a treatise on what the actor had undergone in prepping for this role, rather than a look at the character himself. No denying his effort, but subtlety is an art that was Not practiced by either the star or the director in these few sequences. Very self-indulgent, and took me right out of the movie. I loved 'The Fighter' as well as 'Silver Linings playbook', even though there were moments of self-indulgence in the latter as well, they were not put in to the point of being overwhelming.As it has been said many times while referencing this movie, Jennifer Lawrence steals every scene her character's in, and she could well give stiff competition to other Oscar noms in the BSA category. One of the things being missed by most critics/reviewers, is the fact that every scene with Louis CK's a hoot, and Cooper's interplay with him is very, very hilarious. Sadly, unacknowledged. A cameo by another scene-stealer has the intended effect, and added to the overall charm of the movie. Renner does well in a very thankless role.Conclusively, definitely a great watch, but not one of Russell's best, and definitely not deserving of all the Oscar love, IMHO.A shout-out for the editing, for though the movie's a tad overlong in hindsight, it never outstays its welcome. Go watch it at a local cinema close by.....",Null,5,9,20 January 2014
Nightcrawler," The Ticket
","After 'Kill the messenger', another one shot on film rather than digital. A side note on this topic - I love both media, and I hate the fact that, like religion or politics, the choice to shoot on film (Nolan and his ilk) and digital (Abrams for one, Michael Mann, and their ilk) is divvying up audiences/nerds alike. I think the ones standing for each, and deriding the so-called opposing camp are complete idiots, missing the point of the other, and the film-makers who exercise their choices. To them - just go watch the damn movie first, and then go rant all you want. After making the note that I did, that this one was shot on film, and also noting that it looked (and sounds sometimes) like one of my favorite movies of a couple years back, 'Drive', I just lost myself in good ol' film-making. I couldn't care less if it was 3D, IMAX, film or digital. That's the power of film-makers such as Dan Gilroy, who helmed this one, where it's all about the flick, and the craft is just a tool he uses to narrate a good ol' tale.Everything else serves solely in narrating the tale. Did not know Gilroy had this amount of latent talent for directing hidden in him - I'm glad he got funding for this project, and was able to bring his vision to the screen without making too many compromises. His film- making style, also evoked memories of how his brother, Tony, handled the narration, as well as the build-up to each set-piece, in 'The Bourne Legacy' (a vastly underrated movie in its own right, for which Dan wrote the screenplay as well, so there). I confess enjoying the Tarsem Singh directed 'The Fall' as well, which is another underrated movie IMO.Back to Nightcrawler though - there is no shaky-cam, and though I have nothing against the Greengrass kind of film-making either, this movie is well-served by that choice as well. The tale, and each of its twists and accompanying turns imparts the sense or urgency needed each time, and additional style is not a necessity in manipulating our emotions to force us to feel the same. No mean achievement that.I could not watch Jake Gyllenhaal in anything. He was an absolute revelation in 'Brothers' to me, though that was a remake, it might actually have been the superior version for his presence, and performance. Then came 'Source Code', 'End of Watch', 'Prisoners' ('then came', in the sense of my chronology of watching a Gyllenhaal flick, not that he made that next), which was followed by 'Enemy' - each almost a role more difficult than the one that came before, or a peer in terms of how difficult it must've been to be cast for in the first place, work on, then successfully pull it off. He embodied them all with aplomb. It's almost like he can never, ever, choose to be any lesser material ('Prince of Persia' notwithstanding). A-grade stuff only. We're definitely lucky to be able to witness this streak of his, in these times. As to playing this character, he completely owns it, and the writing is of a class that you hang on to every word he's (motor) mouthing, even though you know he's (character-wise) not someone you'll feel comfortable empathizing with, or even sympathizing with (pardon the wordplay - but believe you me, it is very much contextual, and relevant). You also know that he's basically regurgitating stuff he read from various self-help books, and you don't mind, since he has a way of making those words count, and feel incredibly creepy at the same time that you're not sure what's gonna explode next. Rene Russo gets a rare chance, post Lethal Weapon 3, to really sink her teeth into something, and though I feel that perhaps 2/3 scenes with her have been left either on the editing floor, or in the censorship office, she manages to more than hold her own nevertheless, and that's no mean feat acting opposite our very own Darko. Riz Ahmed, known to audiences from his fantastic turn in the comedic masterpiece, '4 Lions', and to a lesser extent, from 'The reluctant fundamentalist' and 'Close Circuit', turns in another fantastic and earthy flawed character and makes it his own, and his character's complete arc is something to behold. Powerful stuff, and perfectly cast. It's been a while since I saw Bill Paxton (what a nice coupla years for him too - 'Edge of tomorrow', '2 Guns', 'Million Dollar Arm'), and he's the original Nightcrawler here (remember 'Near Dark'? or 'Frailty'?). His arc is quite possibly the most powerful of all, and is quite breathtaking to behold. I am leaving a lot of stuff out, since one should enjoy the movie and be surprised/shocked with each plot twist, otherwise it's like reading the last page of the book and then starting from the beginning again, and though it might work for some, it doesn't for the most of us.After a disappointing soundtrack on a movie of the stature of 'Gone Girl', it's refreshing to find a movie that has a strong soundtrack like this one does. Nic Ratner / Brian Ross, supervising the score composed by James Newton Howard, give one of the most eclectic scores, I've heard in a while now, and there's hope yet for crime noir.And oh, on 'Gone girl', compare the activities of the media in that one, to the same (kinda) elements that are front-and-center here. In one conversation that a lead character (all leads are morally corrupt and bereft of anything remotely resembling a conscience ) has with the sole voice-of- reason, you'll feel disgusted, disappointed and scared in turns . :-)Big screen only, folks.",Null,0,3,8 November 2014
The Revenant," On est tous des sauvages
","Watched a 4k digital version on a large screen (IMAX, but the version presented was anything but that). Now, if anyone has seen Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto', that movie can give you a fair idea on what to expect, both in terms of this being a frenetically paced set-piece rolling after set- piece, with the makers not holding back on period gore throughout. Tough to sit through, but its an experience of sorts. What I was nevertheless surprised by, is how little of the main plot has been given away by this movie's trailers and many reviews. Kudos both to the marketing team of the movie, and fans who did check themselves while trying to describe their own experience while viewing this. Other than 'Apocalypto', this one also shares DNA with 'Mad Max: Fury road' and 'Birdman: the unexpected value of ignorance' (Inarritu's own creation from last year). While the former comparison has more to do with the forceful and relentless nature of things, the latter comparison is due to the fact that we are forced to inhabit the same world that the main lead does, and follow him around throughout, from beginning to end. The way this is made, hearkens back to what director Peter Weir might have been going for with his underrated/under-seen 'The Way back' (Jim Sturgess, Saoirse Ronan, Ed Harris, Colin Farrell), but did not quite get, keeping that one firmly in the almost-R/PG-13 mainstream zone.Tom Hardy plays the heavy, interestingly reunited with his co-star from 'Inception', Leonardo DiCaprio, who has to be one of the most punished lead characters ever put on film. Will this work the Oscar magic for him though? Considering this is a very controversial year for the Oscars, even a win this year might just be considered pyrrhic due to the color of his skin (the controversy sheds light on a fair point, but this nomination might just not be a part of it).All that shouldn't detract from the fact that this was well put together, from cinematography to score, direction to editing, and yes, makes this a superior movie to Apocalypto even.I'm heading to the (censored) (L)I(e)max viewing this week, and do feel this is one for multiple viewings.More thoughts from 2 viewing, on a (L)I(e)max screen, with ambient construction noise screwing up the sound design playing back, and one side of the digitally projected image flickering continually.Observed that Domhnall Gleeson (Ex machina, About time, Force awakens, Shadow dancer, son of Brendan 'Troy' 'Calvary' 'Garda' Gleeson) acquired himself admirably, having the 3rd best presence, allegiance DiCaprio and Hardy (unfairly overlooked for a spring actor nomination, that, imo, he was a 'Locke' for)...The other comparisons we could make, include 'The last of the Mohicans' and 'The Road' (even 'The Walking Dead'), and though I felt this was better than 'Apocalypto', overall, I still found this wanting in the action set-piece department.I do know that I have to read the book this one's based on, especially to understand about the Sioux and the Pawnee tribes that are very much a party of this tale.",Null,0,4,28 February 2016
Divergent," Not as spectacular, now
","Neither have the books withstood it, nor will the movie/s - the comparison to 'The Hunger Games' works, and other t(w)een/YA franchises out there. Straight-off, let me be the one to say that this one pales in comparison, in every department. The style, look, production and art design is evocative of Andrew Niccol's Gattaca and In time, albeit without the polish (and that's not a good thing) that both of those had (Sad that he had to kill his goodwill with 'The Host' - and it is creepy that both Diane Kruger in that one, and Kate Winslet in this one, are characterized in a similar fashion, along with their looks).The film begins strongly, and has one of the most strongest 1st half's committed to mainstream film. Its when people start sharing/viewing each others' dreamscapes that it started losing me, and by the time it chugs along to the very contrived ending, that's no surprise to any veteran of teen dystopia, this is completely run out of steam.Neil Burger has made better flicks, though this one does benefit from his involvement.Theo James fits the part, Shailene Woodley's as good as Jen Law, in basically a relatively more straight-forward role, with her 'Spectacular Now' co-star, Miles Teller, this time locking horns with her rather than lips. Winslet's alright, as are Judd and Goldwyn, and there are others who might prove their mettle in the sequels. And oh, in case you were wondering, Maggie Q's wasted, as is Mekhi Phifer. On the other hand, Jai Courtney and Miles Teller have their moments.The cinematography and soundtrack are top-notch, with one sequence being scored spectacularly so, at around the 20 minute mark, when the leads are being 'initiated' into their new faction. Another thing that went wasted - the propensity for full- blown parkour. Sad.The icky teen-romance bit is toned down, which is a relief, since it has been done to death since those sparkly vampire movies. And yes, you do find yourself thinking about not just the Hunger games franchise, but also Twilight, Mortal instruments, Warm bodies et al.I just wish more care had been taken to ensure that the movie's 2nd half matched the momentum, as well as the quality of the 1st. Plus, the depiction of future-tech in this is borderline pathetic, working just like a bad Bollywood flick to force our suspension-of-disbelief up about 9,99,9999 notches. OK, not That bad, but Bad, fo sho. Not done, not in this day and age. Not a good thing, by any means. Here's hoping the sequel fares better from those perspectives.",Null,0,2,10 April 2014
The Lego Movie," With/out instructions
","My review, with information that could be considered spoiler-ific. Be prepared to enjoy an intelligent, memorable movie, that takes the theme of creation using Lego blocks, and crafting a story around it that is not just entertaining, but also a delight and a treat for the senses. However, it does not seem to be deserving of all the excessive praise being heaped on it, esp. since the kids might not be taking away as much as us adults. Up, Finding Nemo and Incredibles happen to be those works that transcend age - and though this one's a lotta fun, its not in their league, not the way most critics are making it out to be. The voice talent is quite varied, and eclectic even, with most of the laughs coming from the character voiced by the ever-elegant Morgan Freeman, who gamely pokes a lot of fun at his own persona; as does Liam Neeson. They're efficiently surrounded by Ferrell, Banks, Pratt, Brie, Arnett, Hill, Day and the like, and the sincerity shows in every phrase/frame. It is most difficult to wrong surprises while sticking close to the formula, and both Lord/Miller show that their rendering of 21 Jump Street was no flash in the pan (I'm in the minority of not being a big fan of 'Cloudy with...', since spite of having watched it on IMAX 3D). What's dividing critics, and put me solidly on the other side of the fence, is the whole meta-aspect to the whole thing, that, IMO, was introduced unnecessarily in the 3rd act, though the final denouement (which was strong) would make no sense without that. If that had been handled better, I'd be rooting for this one all the way, the way most of the masses are doing right now. However, conclusively, this is quite a lot of good fun at the movies, so I'd advise for all families to make that trip to the local multiplex and have a nice time.",Null,0,3,9 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Determining who lives and dies
","A powerful movie of 1 flawed man's battle to live, not just on his own terms, but also using any means available, and those not made available by the bodies that govern people in the US. This is a very important, timely and topical movie, and I don't know if the audiences watching this are focusing on that aspect at all, or will the issue be swept under by the onslaught of superlative performances like how it happened with 'Erin Brockovich'? Unfortunately, I got to watch the chopped version, though it also did not deter much from the power inherent in key sequences.Jared Leto is a shoo-in for a win, IMO, as is McConaughey, though the transformation could have been depicted better (however, its not as in-your-face as Bale's was in 'American Hustle' causing audiences to focus on that instead of on the character himself).Garner finally has something to do with, and she chews on it as she can. Gone are those expressions sans confidence - this is a welcome return-to-form (though my friends says the same of her leading 'Butter' as well, but I'm yet to watch that, so this will remain my frame of reference).From a man who's given a finite time to live, who goes into denial, but then comes through to grapple with the reality that he's been given, and rise above that, while also trying to use unorthodox means to do that, is no mean feat. I am now primed to read up the real story of Ronal Woodroof, and see if it affected anything at all. This makes a close companion-piece to 'Fire in the blood', and if someone watches this, they will be able to immediately understand why I made this correlation.Not to be missed, esp. on the big screen, preferably uncut.",Null,2,2,1 March 2014
Now You See Me," Now you don't
","'After Earth', I also watched another surprisingly better-than-average (not more) magic-themed movie, 'Now you see me'.It did serve to get the 'after' taste out, but only just.The best parts about this one - the casting, the (unfortunately pretentiously) dense plotting (which did not stand well to closer scrutiny, but hey, the film-makers actually joke about that at the very beginning of the film - if you're standing too close, that means...blah blah). I just adore Laurent, and have seen her in everything from 'Basterds' to 'Beginners' to 'Le concert' to 'Je vais bien...' to 'Paris' and she's been mesmerizing in each and every one of those roles, even where she had (relatively) limited screen-time. Then she did this. Even so, for me, she was one of the bright sparks of the whole thing.Woody Harrelson stands out, as always, as he re-teams with his 'Zombieland' sidekick, who's just here for the paycheck, much like Freeman, Caine and Ruffalo are. Ruffalo gets a meaty mainstream role after a while and he digs into it with glee (as does the other Franco), though he does look befuddled as well, perhaps rightfully. 'The eye' is never fully released, and IMHO, it should have occupied the bulk of the movie, not needing the 'too-pat' speedy denouement it finally receives. Fisher is miscast - 'nuff said.I missed the relevance of all the plot's twists and turns during the final 20 minutes, and had almost given up on trying to catch up, until the exposition-laden final 6/7 min. Somehow, though it is usually a good thing ('Fallen', 'Frailty', 'Primal fear', 'Fight club' spring to mind), in this case, I did not really care.However, this was just what the doctor ordered 'After Earth'.....",Null,0,0,23 March 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The era of the thinking person's popcorn flicks
","Thought I'm sorely tempted to credit Nolan for the thinking person's blockbuster, I cannot deny that Singer has been there before, and done that before (for some, he's done better before, in the mainstream realm). Fear not, he betters the best mainstream X-Men movie he's done with this one. I, for one, love 'First Class', and what Vaughn brought to it. When they announced that has-been Singer was returning to helm, I was worried. Well, was I wrong. Sure, it might have perhaps been better with Vaughn in the director's chair (who knows?), but this is one intelligent piece of mainstream cinema that I, for one, will wanna watch once again (the darkness that pervades converted 3D cinema is very much in your face for this outing, and I'd like another viewing, not just for that reason).Perhaps one of the best outings for Jackman's mutant ever, this one sets up the next one in this universe very cleverly, and yes, far too conveniently as well, but I'm not gonna be the one to complain. Bringing some cool first-time visual aesthetics to the starved sci-fi actioner genre, this one plays like the trend-setting first Matrix movie for the never-too-creatively-bereft superhero cinema, which did need a shot in the arm post the latest Spidey outing, that was shorn of the intellectual edgeWith nods to various characters, old and new, and various Easter eggs sprinkled, laying the foundation for upcoming alternate universe tales, this is sheer joy, with my only concern being the way movie studio franchises will now ape the rebooting of each franchise with the same set of characters and actors, and are liable to have eggs on their face more often than not, since this is lightning in a bottle.The 3D (converted) is pretty good, but it will depend on the projection system in the cinema you choose.

Captain America: Civil War," Community: Superhero paintball
","Few thoughts, based on 2 viewings on release-day, almost back-back, in different cinemas, one on an IMAX screen, albeit without the IMAX print, darker-toned in spite of digital 4K.Avengers 2.5, not Cap 3. But not a bad thing at that. Since the story at its core is more like Winter Soldier part 2.Getting the Russo brothers to spearhead/direct 'CA2: Winter soldier' was perhaps one of the most inspiring things done by Marvel's Kevin Feige, almost on par with his hiring Firefly's Joss Whedon for the 1st Avengers movie, still the best, in this series.Other than the political shenanigans in that one, one of its characteristics was its being a consistently high-energy, kinetic action set-piece showcase, which were tied together very, very well.However, this one also has a lot of weak plot-elements, and while (in my head) they're so big that they should derail the entire movie, they don't, because whatever's good is so strong that the movie stands up to be its own great epic-feeling experience.Confused about whether to begin with the weak stuff, or the strong ones.Before that though, here's the sequence of the movies in the Marvel universe, beginning all the way with 'Iron Man'. Every time there's a release of one of these, all these movies play the night before, and there are hardcore fans out there, few of them friends of mine, who binge-watch them all every time.Iron Man, The incredible Hulk (Norton, Roth, Hurt), Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The 1st Avenger, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor: the dark world, Captain America (2): The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers (2): Age of Ultron, Ant-man, CA(3)/Avengers 2.5: Civil War/....this one......OK Lemme begin strong (heh-heh):* The superhero smack-down sequences, all the way to the end. 3 larger-than-life action set-pieces. And though the one at the end does not come close to bettering the ones that came before, and this IS a kinda let-down, they've all been intricately staged and executed. * Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. All of his angst, in spite of being clichÃ©d, do work. * This is gonna be controversial, but the absence of Thor and Hulk, is actually believable here, and makes sense, even with a little lip-service. * The original person who brought the Avengers together, Ant-man, not Hank Pym like in the comics, but Paul Rudd's Scott Lang. A hoot, in each and every sequence he's in. Cannot wait for Ant-man 2. A. Ma. Zing!!!!!!! * Spidey in an action sequence. Excellent in-action character interplay. * The airport, nee, runway, showdown. * The chase in Vienna (or what stood-in for Vienna). * Finally, decent runtime. Finally. For the Falcon, Sharon Carter, and even William Hurt's Ross. * United Nations getting in on some Avengers action. Not enuf (see below), but some of it. * The 3D. * Couple of Zemo-twists, at the end, that ultimately turned out to be weak (see below), but were effective on first viewing.Now, and this is to get it outta my system, the (Very, very) Weak stuff:* No Nick Fury. No Maria Hill. No explanation for their not being there. Even the absence of P.Potts, nvr a major plot-device, except for 'Iron Man 3' is given a cursory once-over, but their absence after their presence all over the last one? * My favorite Ross was Sam Elliott in the first, and absolutely fantastic 'Hulk', made by Ang Lee, in the Kenneth Branagh style of grand Shakespearean tragedy, not William Hurt from the Transporter style of Leterrier's filmmaking (tho Tim Roth stood out, along with Norton). So, guess what? No Elliott, only Hurt, and perhaps one of the weakest rounders-up ever, especially without Nick Fury around. * 10 minutes to Spider-man, for no reason? Seriously? Iron man had to go bring this guy for help? Against Cap? That entire segment might have made more sense in the stand-alone Spider-man movie, and this could just have been just a call from 'Stank' to him. 10-minute runtime, I would have edited out, never mind all the hysterical whistling in the cinema, by public who think they know these chaps! * * Love Marisa Tomei. But, she's aunt May? Come on!!!!! All shapes and sizes, indeed.... * Sebastian Stan's time from when he falls off the top of the train in Cap 1, until Winter soldier, is still a little bit shrouded. Who saved him (Hydra, I know)? How did that save come about? Lazy storytelling. And these guys squeezed Spider Man 0.5 at the cost of Winter Soldier. Sad. * Very less runtime for Hawkeye, Crossbones, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch. * * Speaking of Wanda what about her angst regarding the death of Quicksilver? Doesn't mtr anymore? * Rhodey. L4-S1 after that? Seriously? * The Vision: Drone and drone and drone.....and drone some more. Yawn! * The action set- pieces, which need to be better than the one that came last. Here, however, the one in the middle, so to speak, is the best of the lot. * How about a non-US SoS heading the UN Avengers initiative? Do away with Ross, or have them partner, or don't call it the U.N., for chrissakes. 'Hannibal' (the movie) was more international, with Giancarlo Giannini playing a prominent character on the trail of you-know-who. * Now, and this is perhaps the weakest link in all Marvel movies. What does it take for a superhero to die? In the comics, Steve Rogers' Cap mantle is taken on both by Bucky, as well as the Falcon. Where are the surprises? I'm not asking them to go full GoT on this, but hey? Elements of surprise are good.....",Null,0,2,7 May 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Elementary, my dear Wat (ahem) Bilbo...
","One the first things that struck me was this - how much better this would have seemed on IMAX 3D (not the DMR variety, which IS playing in limited release in India, but if they had actually filmed few sequences using that format, and then we got to watch it in a good IMAX cinema - not DigiMAX/LieMAX).The next thing that struck me - why did it have to be another cliffhanger ending? I get it. The story continues. But, why not have each movie be self-sufficient as well? I don't think it's too much to ask. I've read the books, so I know what happens, but still I felt cheated. Esp. coming off 'Catching Fire' just last weekend (in India at least).The 3rd, and possibly more important, more responsible thing - when the initial LOTR movie came out, there was an uproar about PG13 rating allowing filmmakers to get away with a certain amount of gore, as long as there's no bleeding. We have Orcs in this, who get decapitated in all sorts of gruesome ways, and we're used to it all now, considering the 4 movies that have had 'it' abundantly. Perhaps this is the one that has it the most, flying at us in 3D. I'm all for hard R-rated stuff, but considering this is what our kids are gonna be watching, I am skeptical about the PG13 being awarded to this. It does help that we do not feel sorry for the Orcs in any way, but I think that was by design, and makes it all video-gamey, allowing us to immune ourselves to the violence that is being meted out, and somehow, that's not a good thing, IMO.All that apart, this is one rousing, spectacular swashbuckler, with all the fat trimmed off, so naysayers of the first one have literally nothing to crib about (but you never know with cribbers, seeing how I spent my first 2 paragraphs ranting). Jackson has made better movies, but it is nevertheless great to watch this one on the big screen. Sure, he could have avoided the Twilight-triangle, but it does not consume much screen time, and 1 of those scenes is actually tender, coming off of an unintentionally funny sequence (you'll know it when you see it).Holmes and Watson (ahem), Cumberbatch and Freeman, get together again, and do quite a bit of (this time, unintelligent, when compared to Gollum's and Bilbo's 'encounter' in the 1st one) verbal jousting before (literally) taking off. Armitage, McKellen and Bloom all continue to be good, while Fry, Pace and Evans are wasted. One of the big items on my wishlist (for this series) has been the re-creation of the battle from which Sauron has vanquished, and when I heard that Jackson was actually adding stuff not there in the books, I dared to hope. Alas, that is not to be, though he seemingly has added a lot of exhilarating stuff that's also not present in the books, along with plot arcs and characters.Here's hoping I catch it once again on IMAX, and await the final instalment next year, when Jackson takes us all 'There and back again'. Knowing how he chooses to tie everything with a bow (think 'Return of the King'), I think we're all in for a spectacular finish.Note: Freeman acts by never allowing us to acknowledge that there's an actor under all that hobbit makeup, and that's no mean feat. Here's lookin' fwd to more from dear Watson......",Null,3,8,15 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," What did you expect with that title?
","What could've been a maudlin, mushy exercise in wishy-washy-weepy fare turns out to be thoroughly entertaining, engrossing and emotionally fulfilling. Aided in no small measure by the tight screenplay and the source work, the key lead performances and their collective as well as individual predicaments hold mainstay throughout, without even treading into sentimental territory. Sure, there are tears shed, but nothing that wouldn't be happening in scenarios such as this one out in the real world. Shailene Woodley, after her 'spectacularly divergent' turns in the recent past, owns this along with her non-Divergent brother who plays the lead here opposite her - Ansel Elgort. Cocky to the point of being annoyingly arrogant, he dials that stuff down just enough for us to care for the fate of the protagonists.Even though a couple of themes explored here seem far-fetched, the characterization never allows us to wallow in despair, and the various instances during which emotionally distressing events are handled with flair and humor make everyone tide over the difficulty of handling near-death situations while interacting/living with palliative care-worthy patients.The score keeps things lively, and along with '500 days of summer', will make a good addition for collectors. Laura Dern and Sam Merlott provide adequate support with the limited material they're handed, but Willem Dafoe still proves that he will always be a scene-stealer, no matter the grotesquerie he inhabits in front of the camera, chewing up everything else with each word he utters. I generally look for originality whenever I try to watch a movie, but watching this one, though every beat is predictable and by-the-numbers, it made me appreciate what a well-written screenplay could bring to the table and make something worth enjoying, appreciating the finer nuances of each aspect of film-making. Sure, its not 'As good as it gets' (in more ways than one), but for now, it will do.",Null,1,2,4 July 2014
Non-Stop," No-brainer, dumb, disposable, passable entertainment (possibly never in-flight)
","I love events unfolding in real-time. The intended effect filmmakers using this technique want one to have is of being there, and interacting, or feeling as if one has influenced those proceedings unfolding in front of them. However, its still a movie, and needs much more than just technique to propel it forward Non-Stop, as these filmmakers have elected to call this misstep in misdirection.In spite of that, this still is what's known as a Paisa vasool timepass flick over 'ere. Liam Neeson continues to slum past his prime in no-brainer actioners like this one, and Jan/Feb seems to be the perfect time for his flicks to find multiplexes. This time, he's the cop on a plane, and no one's quite 'taken' his family - there's a different motivating factor this time around, like it was in 'Unknown'. There is a backstory influencing everything, and the makers try to tie up a few loose ends neatly, but it falls apart if you feign to pay attention to the plot. Instead, like one does at those Transformers movies, don't think, just react to the events unfolding, and you might find the goings-on passable, maybe even plausible, since one needs that, plus oodles of suspension-of-disbelief, esp. towards its eventual denouement, to enjoy this dumb plot. I confess this made for my guilty pleasure, esp. after having watched 'Dallas Buyers club' and 'Nebraska' back-back the previous night. I'd double- billed this one with 'Mr. Peabody and Sherman', so this seemed like more of the same (admittedly, more brainwork was required for processing the former), albeit without the 3D, or Mr. Peabody. The weakest part, that everyone would have pointed out by now, are the following aspects, IMO:a. Who the bad guy(s)/gal(s) is/are; b. What motivates(d) them to put this entire movie in motion; and c. How any number of logical actions could have prevented him/her/them from succeeding within the first 15 minutes.Jaume Collet-Serra did infinitely better with Neeson and the rest of the cast of 'Unknown' and that's definitely sayin' somethin'. Julianne Moore, Scoot McNairy (fantastic in 'In search of a midnight kiss', 'Argo', 'Killing them softly', 'Monsters'.....), Corey Stoll (one of the best reasons to follow 'House of Cards') and Lupita Nyong'o (12 years a slave - best supporting actress winner) are all gloriously wasted, though I do confess enjoying watching their stock characters interact on the big-screen. Omar Metwally (Munich, Rendition..) stood tall among them all, even taking on Neeson's performance head-head, IMO. I do hope we see more of him (NO pun intended).The CGI was surprisingly better-than-average; considering the outsourcing trend in Hollywood these days, I thought it'd be crappy like it has been in quite a few big- budget no-brainer actioners in the recent past (I'm lookin' at you, Bruce Willis - for having done 'The cold light of day' and 'A good day to die hard', 2 flicks with some of the most crappiest CGI ever committed on-screen). He's making another one with Neeson called 'Run All Night', and I do hope it turns out better than this one (its got Ed Harris too, so......).Disposable/forgettable/regurgitated, yet passable entertainment.",Null,0,0,5 March 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Training knight
","Well, there's not a lot of training going' on in this, the movie having dispensed with all that in the first movie. This now, is a grand soap-opera, a la 'Star Wars'. Not necessarily a bad thing, and mo' Craig Ferguson is always welcome.With the animated prod design that repeatedly evocative of 'Avatar', this one does try to soar high, and has a few beats that keep it up a notch compared to a lot of non-Disney, non-Pixar animated fare. But it does not quite reach the pinnacle achieved by the first one, other than for the nice camaraderie between the leads, that seems to have grown a bit stronger.The 'Empire strikes back' reference by other audience-members is also spot-on, and you might wanna get prepped on how to explain a few key occurrences to your child. Not an easy ask.The new baddie, voiced by Djimon Hounsou, is a sadly under-developed, stock- baddie, who's not even menacing, though he's all-powerful to the extent of making some key changes to the landscape that these movies reside in. In spite of that, he's just meh.There are still quite a bit of things that work, and most of it is credit to the animation and the action set-pieces. And yes, mo' dragons, and quite sure, for me at least, more Ferg. But all the 'Avatar' esque imagery gets tiring (perhaps because I've watched that flick like a gazillion times). The 3D's actually fantastic, and this is one of those movies that make the case FOR 3D, rather than 'those' ones that make it look all yucky. The voice-work's pretty decent, since other than Ferguson, Baruchel and Butler do really good jobs. He and Blanchett croon, even. There's quite a bit of comedy thrown in, but it's not for the ones who treasure smart repartee, but for those who get high on Michael Bay's Transformers kinda comedy. And that's really sad, considering the benchmark set by the first one.The soundtrack's a complete drag, in perfect accompaniment to the plot, which is all tired and pedestrian, with a baddie who has no reason to be in this movie at all, and is meh all the way.All in all, quite a good watch, for once, on the big screen. But I will not be induced to watch it once again. I had higher expectations. Sigh.",Null,1,6,19 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Prolly just me
","It's a Wes Anderson movie. So, there the whimsy, there's the ensemble, and there's the prose (and what beautiful prose it is).The ensemble - Ralph Fiennes, F Murray Abraham (we need more), Jude Law, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Saoirse Ronan, Harvey Keitel, Léa Seydoux (unrecognizable, and sans any close-ups), Tilda Swinton (unrecognizable), Tom Wilkinson, Mathieu Amalric, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzmann - though most of them are glorified cameos at best, and not all are utilized well, but that's a small complaint since the tale's sumptuous enough to ensure ignoring that your favorite actor doesn't have all the good scenes or all the best lines.The production design's perfect and makes the period come alive, making the sumptuous 35mm cinematography perfect (while I was wishing that 35mm and 70mm gimmick could've been done away with, so that the widescreen aspect could have been consistent throughout). One thing I did not get - why did it have to be fictional country? Who is Wes trying not to offend? I don't know if I missed something there.I also did not get the point of the multiple narrative-within-narrative structure used within the context of the movie. Felt like it was a device that was just used because it caught the screenwriter's whim/fancy, without there being any need to be relevant, or contextual. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of most of Anderson's work, and whimsy in general, but this was more in terms of just being put there for effect, nothing else, like the 35mm/70mm toggle, which also served no point except to ensure you got it that this one was not of the same period, which is clear enough without it having to be drummed in,, and losing out on the benefits of the widescreen aspect (I might've already covered it, but what the heck, I'm irritated whenever I think of it - what a friggin' waste).All in all, definitely not for the mainstream audience, and even for Indie audiences, and Wes Anderson fans, if you're particular about a few aspects of film-making be prepared not to take the majority opinion online at its face value, and to be (kinda, not all the way) let down.",Null,1,4,27 July 2014
Foxcatcher," Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
","One of the more darker dramas out locally this weekend, the first question I had when the projector began rolling is, 'why one more in 1.85:1'? What's up with Bennett Miller, who's used this aspect ratio for his movie post-Moneyball, which was filmed in glorious 2.35:1?Anyway, that became a minor nit to pick as the movie unfolded, and sucked me in.Steve Carell, moving away from his typical schtick (he has tried before, and was good in the likes of 'Little Miss Sunshine' and 'Seeking a friend for the end of the world' and the like) once again, sinks into his role of John 'Eagle' Du Pont with gusto, making us audience-members just fall shy of closing our eyes whenever his reprehensible characters proceeds to make everyone else uncomfortable on-screen. He comes alive like very few do, and makes us question his existence in the scheme of things.This has to be the most work done by a young actor like Tatum, that we can see all his hard work translated to the big screen. His every wrestling move, spar and training setup, along with his pent-up feelings are they for us to see, and appreciate.This is a movie of performances, and the spot-on casting brings them all to life. Mark Ruffalo, on the other hand (as compared to both Carell and Tatum) is perhaps the most seasoned of this bunch, and boy does it show! He comprehensively inhabits the character of the caring elder brother to Channing Tatum's younger 'un, and the kindness, knowledge, understanding and genuine compassion in his eyes is more than any line the screenplay could have had for this actor. This is a complete performance, not just nomination-worthy, but perhaps deserving of a win.To the plot then: to me, the movie was more about how the privileged, who take everything and everyone for granted, deciding to own another slice of life for their own agenda, and end up taking something precious, something fragile, treating them diffidently and even tenderly for as long as it suited them, and then deciding, even unconsciously/inadvertently, prompted by their more misguided baser emotions, to completely destroy that which they treasured, and finally wondering what went wrong (not even what they did wrong). That's how it plays out, and watching it unfold is nothing short of fascinating, a little more to me than most, due to certain life experiences that hold a very nice mirror to the events unfolding like a juggernaut. However, I (predominantly) hate biopics. There is no fascination in me to watch something that I've read about somewhere. But I do watch them most of the time, since there are elements that I find fascinating, and it's almost like (even for many others I know) the fascination inherent in watching a trainwreck (nothing to do with the negative connotation there). 127 hours, for example. J Edgar (I know I'm in a minority for that one) being another. Lincoln, and perhaps a few others like Zodiac etc.. Ah, Kill the Messenger was another, and this movie shares something in common with that one, especially the period look-and-feel.I love it when filmmakers subvert our expectations, like Tarantino did with 'Inglourious Basterds', essentially rewriting history. Fat chance on that happening with this work, but, only for me, due to whatever reason, this happened. Listen closely:Going in to this viewing, I thought I knew how the story ended, and for me it was all a question of how the characters found themselves at that particular precipice from the moment it began, to when there was a snack break and it began again. Imagine my surprise when I found that I had it all wrong. The main event that eventually takes place, did not happen to one of the key characters I thought it would happen to, but to another key character. And....you could've knocked me down flat. I was like, whaaaaaa....? And I'd thought I knew how it was gonna end. Goes to show. Apparently, from many other accounts, I wasn't the only one who'd got my facts wrong. So, inadvertently, those others and me ended up having a more profound experience for sure, than all those others who knows how it ends in this one.Pity there wasn't more Anne Bancroft, though the 2 scenes she's in, you could hear a pin drop at the multiplex that I watched this in.All in all, a wonderful watch at the cinema, barring the crapfest they had with the subtitles, which were at least 90 seconds ahead of the scene taking place. Bad form, cinema! Bad form, projectionists-who-don't-care-enough-to-stay-throughout-the-viewing. Try requesting the staff to keep those pesky sub-titles off for the viewing, if you care as much.",Null,0,4,2 February 2015
It Follows," Pay it forward
","Well, first off, I did not expect a release for this Indie locally, and when it happened, the first emotion is one of overwhelming grateful-ness. I also did not expect much of the nudity of the sex sequences to make it to the final cut, and I was right, but surprisingly, a few long shots of said nudity made it without them being blurred out, and few more mag snaps. Puzzling, but hopefully a sign of things to improve. Or not.This one's been making the rounds for being the surprise Indie hit (actually, slightly better-than-average, if numbers are crunched accurately) this year, the way 'The Babadook' was. Helmer David Robert Mitchell has a few credits, but other than a mixed bag review for 'The myth of the American sleepover', has really nothing to recommend him, other than this one.Well, to the movie now: While I wholeheartedly recommend that this be viewing in cinemas, and have read glowing reviews for the same, there were so many why-in-blazes-did-they-do-that sequences that I feel that all the compliments are grossly overblown, making this one of the most overrated movies of this year. + The cinematography, complemented by some very able camera-work, that is very old-school, making the Michigan locations chosen to be pitch-perfect to film in and around. The old-school long shots as well, evokes old-school John Carpenter in more than one sequence.+ The rules not being very clear (changing a tad, here and there) puts us firmly in the shoes of the possible vic, empathizing with their situation, and realistically not knowing where the menace is gonna spring from next, or what keeps it going, and for what reason, kinda keeping it all very grounded. The aspect of a literal level of Ctrl+Z happening with the rules on the death of a vic, where the 'force' zeroes back on the previous possible vic, is quite novel, and makes for a nice explanation on how the pre-title sequence came about.+ The soundtrack by Disasterpeace. Old-school John Carpenter. Gonna purchase it soon. Fantastic. Overdone, overblown, and calls attention to itself, but simply superb and great. Long time since I've listened to such tracks. Not only evoked Carpenter's Halloween (for more than just its soundtrack or his style), but also Ridley Scott's 'Blade runner' for its Vangelis' score. Can't get it outta my head.+ The casting and the performances. This team, might just go places. I've not seen even one of them earlier (something to do with not being in the US as well), and somehow I think that's gonna change.MASSIVE SPOILERS below, and my conclusion beforehand:A movie worth watching on the big screen, and my rants on the movie's minuses need never detract from that. However, for a movie that wants to be taken seriously, there are quite a few loopholes, that hopefully might get fixed in the sequel being planned. <ul><li>The surprising way in which one of the main characters keeps it together while 'passing it on', while, in hindsight, indicates that he/she has done it before, doesn't ring true with the rest of his/her characterization about the same aspect. </li></ul><ul><li>The number of times, as I mentioned previously, that I was wondering why certain characters did what they did, that dialed up the stupidity quotient (wayyy up) to a great extent, and literally caused whiplash with the way the rest of the movie screamed to be considered 'smart'. Ouch.</li></ul><ul><li>The same conceit was used to much, much better effect in Hoblit's 'Fallen', where there was a logical conceit to the central conceit, and the final completely-off-left-field twist ending also gave it a level of respect hitherto not given to mainstream horror/thriller, while keeping the entire flick completely-grounded.</li></ul><ul><li>Where were the parents? Why sleepovers? What's up with all the sleepovers all around? School? Missing from school? Logic?</li></ul><ul><li>(While I did appreciate the changes in the rules laid out to an extent) Why the literal change in rules at the end?

Gone Girl," Gone...Baby....Gone
","Before reading further, know these: 1. I've read the book. Loved it. Made me read all of Flynn's other works. Loved them too. Dark. Subversive. Captivating. Deffo up Fincher's alley for adapting. 2. The supposedly nice cinema I watched this in had geniuses who were always on their mobile phone (including a genius who I accompanied - just my luck), and 3. The sound output was pathetic, along with the noise that was being made perennially by a projector. 4. The omnipresent censor board seemed to be taking it's role quite seriously in this flick, manipulating frame size and position to obscure nudity, sex and violence from all of us innocent moviegoers. Not sure it was something the makers did. Also, towards the end, quite a few lines spoken by one of the lead characters was muted out, and I did not catch anything, in spite of having read the book.Sigh.But the fact that I'd already read the book going in turned out to be surprisingly unfortunate (in spite of this being from the mind of David Fincher, which is weird, since I'd read all the 'Dragon tattoo' books and watched the fantastic Swedish film original 'Män som hatar kvinnor' as well, and his adaptation with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, though totally unnecessary, was right on-the-nose) since this turned out to be a totally uninvolving affair for those who've read the book. At least in my mind, the movie I imagined (IMO) was better than what unfolded. Well.Specifics then:There are far too many blink-kinda transitions from one scene/set- piece to the next, and I do not know why Fincher followed that theme over here. Almost found it distracting every time, though I've not had that complaint for this kinda transition in other works (though nothing comes to mind immediately, other than M:I 3, for which it seemed contextual, ergo, perfect). No style should call attention to itself, IMHO.The performances are perfect, including that of Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt, though they've strangely changed his ethnicity to accommodate Perry. I'd call it racist/reverse-racist, but I'm glad Perry gets to sharpen his acting chops once in a while in roles like this. For my money, better'n Madea-ing around, though that pays better for him.I was also not very impressed by the background score by Fincher regulars, Reznor and Ross, and their attempts to be subtle (not very, since there's always a droning going on in the background, that I feel the score could've done without - and this was not the damn projector fo sho, since I remember 2 separate 'drone' tracks throughout: to be fair, I might not have resented the one in the soundtrack if the other one were absent, but I'll never know, since I do not intend to revisit this one at all). All the other technical aspects, including set and production design, the cinematography, editing (except in few places, perhaps) had people working at the top of their game, meeting Fincher's exacting (but perhaps lowered, in this instance) standards. Last, and perhaps not all that important in the context of all my other points, I was expecting a better title sequence than was seemed (almost) lazily concocted/choreographed here (the one he gave us in 'Se7en' was perhaps the best in his filmography, closely followed by the one he conceived and executed for the 'Dragon Tattoo 1' remake), but I'm sure I wouldn't be dissing an entire movie for a routine kinda title sequence, so there.All in all, a must-watch at the cinema for those who've not read the books. For the rest of us though, a TV viewing with other options on the remote is not a bad idea at all.",Null,0,3,5 November 2014
Drive," Within that 5-minute window
","(Watched this one at the cinema on its release, but posting my previously-written review only now) If this is a new genre, it's great that this is happening in this period, with newer actors taking on the mantle of the strong/silent archetype of the (anti) hero who tries to save the day. Gosling has joined the bandwagon, and this flick shares its DNA with the recent, underrated Dwayne Johnson vehicle, 'Faster'.While that was about vendetta, this is more about low-life crimes, street heists, debts owed and what happens when collection begins.But, the plot's a mere excuse for lotsa style, oodles and oodles of it on neon-soaked LA streets. This flick looks gorgeous, and sounds fantastic, with Cliff Martinez composing retro-themed tracks throughout, and the numbers selected stay in-sync as well. Gosling perhaps has 6-7 lines in all, and the less-is-more kinda approach works, like it does almost always, though it depends a lot on who;s being given that burden to shoulder. Needless to say, Gosling pulls it off.Yep, the movie's gonna be remembered for it's look, setting, sound and Gosling. But no one's gonna eschew the bad-ass turn by one of Hollywood's most beloved dramatic as well as comedic talents, Albert Brooks. Coming off totally left field, he plays the meanest villain ever to grace the silver screen, esp. one who's been cast against type, and how. Partnering with the always-reliable Ron Perlman, Brooks chews every scene he;s in, and I'd like to say that he does it without even trying, in a bid to exaggerate, but that would be doing this thespian's talent a gross injustice, since he's taken pains to imbibe the nuances of the evil character he inhabits over here. And it pays off. It's a great movie, and though it's crowded with talent (not overcrowded) like Mulligan, Walter White (ahem, Cranston), Isaac and Hendricks, not to mention Gosling and Perlman, you'll only remember Brooks, who's fabulous and elevates the already heady material to greater heights.Unfortunately, I got to watch this in a region where violence and nudity are a no-no, and in spite of watching a PG-version of this hard R classic, the other elements were such that I enjoyed myself nevertheless, and look forward to watching it in it's 'harder' glory. Definitely one for the archives, and something that will find its audience sometime or the other.",Null,0,1,9 November 2014
Frozen," Let it go (someone's gotta tell this)
","Quite possibly one of Disney's best, esp. considering that it's been a long time in the making, this adaptation of 'The snow queen' is a nice little throwback, that 'Tangled' and 'The princess and the frog' set out to achieve earlier without (much, esp. of the rousing kind) success. Well-etched characters, a good screenplay, retaining tried- and-tested formulae without making it seem like re-treads, this one's a keeper (and oh, I'm choosing to ignore a couple of plot-holes along the way). Loved the tracks 'Let it go' (the movie-sequence one more than the version rendered during the end-credits), 'Do you want to build a snowman', and 'In summer'.Missed the post-credits sequence (was not aware there was gonna be one), so others reading this can wait and listen to Demi Lovato render 'Let it go' (and compare it with Idina Menzel's own) before it comes on (the Marvel takeover seems to have 'influenced' Disney for these kinda sequences, huh?).(On my 2nd viewing, I waited all the way until all the credits were done, just to have the projectionist in PVR Bengaluru Audi 9 switch it off, leaving the video on, so that our imagination could fill in the gaps)Got to watch it on 3D with Dolby Atmos, so there was that. Might end up watching it once again, since I'm traveling next week. Btw, this one needs 3D viewing, and the excess ticket fare IS justified, so go for it.FYI, the BW Mickey Mouse sequence (pre-title), though not laugh-out-loud hilarious, is cute, and seems to portend a new direction for Mickey and gang (including Big Bad Pete, though a vvvv imp character is missed).

Room," Coming to terms
","One of the best movies depicting a strong parent-child relationship, after the recent 'Babadook'. Those who watched that can find plenty of irony when they get to compare the plot of this one with Jennifer Kent's masterwork.Though I had seen trailers to this one going in, along with having an idea of all of the plot turns, the narration still managed to hold me, and most of the well behaved audience, in a vise-like grip, all the way through. Irony is used more than once within this plot itself, to tie everything up quite badly, and though I'm a fan of keeping things ambiguous, this approach does have its merits, especially as used by the director here.The performances (Brie Larson deserves the Oscar - her performance in 'Short term 12' was overlooked, as does Jacob Tremblay, ably supported by Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H Macy, in a rare performance, in all of 2 scenes, but hey....) are all top notch, and the minimalist approach in each of the movie's technical departments holds up against tough scrutiny, including the use of its score (fantastic, unique...), works to perfection, and greatly helps in putting us in the middle of the protagonists' lives, front-and- center.The best movie I've seen all year this year, in spite of some annoying, and unnecessary censorship. It was strange to note the use of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, though many mainstream and Indie filmmakers, considering the scope of the subject matter, may have gone in for the narrower 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Not complaining. I very much prefer this aspect-ratio, and it works fabulously, especially when one plot device has an important aspect of depicting an evolving perspective of the outside world, that's beautifully realized, while also being subtle.Also appreciate the numerous opportunities not taken by the makers to make this a sloppy melodrama, our a powerful drama that plays to the galleries, while preying on base emotions.Not to be missed. I might go enjoy it once more.",Null,1,6,12 February 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Much more than just another movie
","For whatever reason, this is not finding its groove this holiday season. I just got back from a paid preview showing, and have to confess that I liked it - a lot. Stiller puts in some of the best work he's done (in the commercial milieu - his Indies are my favorites,and are far better than most/all of his commercial vehicles) in a long while (Tropic thunder), both behind, and in front of the camera, and is ably supported by Kristen Wiig and Patton Oswalt. There are weak links in the movie - Adam Scott being one of them, for no fault of his (capable of much, much better work) and the other being (parts of) the narrative itself. At times, I was not sure of the time this was set in (not the time as in the present or the past, but in terms of the movie's primary motif - not giving anything away yet....), and I was not sure if this was a slip on the part of the filmmakers, or if it was intended/on-purpose.The soundtrack's one of the best I've experienced, in spite of the projectionist not giving us enough time to savor the portion after the end-titles and rudely cutting us off. Stiller tries to make this much more than just the short story this one's based o; for example, he makes statements on film-vs-digital (and shoots using film stock) and also tries to capture the profundity in observing the capture of a single moment vs living in it. However, it doesn't come together very evenly, and perhaps that's what's causing all the negativity. In my perception though, that's a very good thing to have in a purportedly commercial flick, since it hits close to home on how uneven actual life on Earth is.Seriously worth a watch on the big screen (another middle finger to those pesky pirates if the movie's playing close by), though it won't make my year's top list.",Null,0,4,2 January 2014
22 Jump Street," The best end-credits sequence, this side of a Marvel chain-flick
","This one didn't need the Depp cameo for it to be a load of fun. Sure, there are more jokes that miss than those that hit home, and sure, its got less Ron Swanson than I'd like, but it's an entertaining ride, and a rare sequel that maintains the tone and momentum of the one that came before, sacrificing less in terms of plot, et al.Phil Lord and Chris Miller are having a really creative burst, esp. with 'The Lego movie', almost like the directorial duo who're helming the Community series as well as the Captain America movies, though they were thought of as someone lite who'd not be able to match up to what was needed to scale it up.One scene in particular that's a whole lotta fun, while having to propensity to cause offense by the truckload, and that has Jonah Hill's character trying to knock out a 'lady' dealer. Another thread that goes on for a bit is the part where Ice Cube's character is given more to do than he was given in the first one, and that 1 whole welcome change. Why couldn't we have more, esp. with Nick Offerman, or the supremely talented Peter Stormare? Why cast someone if you don't give them something substantial to do? More on my gripes later.Most of the situations the leads find themselves in are contrived, and this is something that I feel plagues the entire series. There IS propensity for having a legitimate tale in this universe, and for the sake of laughs, I feel that two intelligent film-makers like these are squandering the opportunity away, and have ended up making a 'Starsky and Hutch' instead.Having said all that, this is still entertaining, and Tatum has upped his game so much that he commands our attention even when Hill's acting his socks off in a role that fits him like a glove. No point watching this one on the Indian big-screen though, since most of the risqué one-liners are ALL friggin' Muted. I'd actually ask everyone in conservative societies that gleefully chop off these works of art to wait for the DVD.And yes, the end-title montage more than makes up for all the other dull montages that came before, and is perhaps one of the best ever montages ever!!!

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Soapy tease
","Fact - this will make tons of money all over, and those Sinister 6 and other side/sequels will get made, no matter what. Fact - this is wayy inferior to this summer's 'Captain America 2: The Winter soldier', and there are better summer movies coming along (perhaps). Fact - this is definitely inferior in quality to both of Sam Raimi's versions, but might match up to the quality of his much-reviled 3rd one. Fact - effects-wise, this has to be the best trip to the big screen that the wall-crawler has ever had, to date. Pity. Along with that, the final 15/20 minutes (minus the last 5) kinda redeem the movie as a whole, but are not enough overall. More's the pity.The crux of the movie, like it was in the previous Webb outing, is the relationship (however simplified, but unnecessarily projected as overly complicated), between the leads. Everything else is just filler. Denis Leary keeps turning up too, leading me to imagine him glaring at Pete even while they make love (Ugh). Unnecessary, and unintentionally hilarious (the audience I was with as well, kept tittering whenever the Leary vision kept appearing). In spite of this gross oversimplification, watching them interact with one another, and keep throwing high school musical lines at one another, is engaging, and keeps the movie afloat for the duration that Webb deems we spend with them. Not Webb's best work, since the chemistry between Levitt and Deschanel was much better realized in '500..'.Completely unnecessary - Along with the (Leary) visions, the flashbacks with Campbell Scott and Chris Cooper. The entire background for something Webb edited out of the first movie. The guy in the shadows. Felicity Jones. The kid in the suit. Giamatti/Rhino. (Where was Ratha, btw?) What we should have got more of - Chris Cooper as ........, Gwen, J Jonah Jameson (still pondering the reason for having this iconic character off-screen in this reboot, esp. since Ratha did not even exist in the comics but they had him in the first one, though they were consistent with the standards they've been setting that they have no explanation for his absence in this one), the action sequences (too few, and too easily resolved - and that's a pity, since the CGI is perhaps some of the best ever committed to screen.....All in all, a decent summer watch on IMAX 3D, but I somehow think that there are better movies in this summer queue (Edge of tomorrow, Godzilla), and I'll be waiting on those.",Null,3,8,1 May 2014
Big Hero 6," For your well-being
","The key element that remains with one after a viewing of this flick is one of irony, based on how it all plays out. Not just limited to how superheroes and arch-nemeses function in their respective universes (think 'The Incredibles'), but also extends to how Disney and Marvel are feeding off of one another after the merger/takeover (there's an almost casual nod to an FF4 kinda team-up, that was a little too on-the-nose for comfort, but might be considered inevitable in a flick of this sort, considering the overall context).The dark elements are all there, with this being another animated flick to take on themes of death and loss, and not being too subtle about it (which is perhaps good, when contrasted with the way 'HTTYD2' handled it - rather awkwardly, and how 'Frozen' chose to handle it). Death and loss arising therefrom is a part of life, and this is the only window to that aspect of life for the little ones who are this flick's target demographic (for my money, 'Up' and 'Finding Nemo' and perhaps even 'The Lion King' handled it with dignity, and it's perhaps a bit much to expect everyone to match up to those standards, or maybe not). Would I want my little one to watch it and field awkward questions after? No, absolutely not. But hey, it's no longer my choice to make, since other kids in school are gonna watch it, and you gotta face it, one time or the other, or have some stranger explain it to your near-and-dear. I'd rather deal with it firsthand.While most of the first act is very endearing, esp. the kids' relationship with their scatterbrained aunt (there should have been much, much more of Maya Rudolph's Aunt Cass, and this flick would've been all the better for it, more Disney-like, in any case, but no one asked me), the camaraderie and joie-de-vivre among the college nerd gang (again, cut short rather abruptly) and the budding relationship between our (kinda) lovable 'Hiro' and his healthcare companion, who's absolutely endearing, and yes, huggable. A lot. And then it all derails in the final act (might have been required, but there was a movie of this genre, the animated superhero genre, that is, that did it wayyyyy better). The Incredibles. Actually, there was one other, a lesser, more underrated work, that still comes to mind in a way that almost banishes this one to be it's really lesser cousin - Megamind. I am surprised at this, since closure is one of Disney's, and Disney-Pixar's think-tank's strengths. They really missed the boat with this one, and it calls to mind (mine at least), the misfire that was this year's HTTYD2 (How to train your dragon 2 - oh, how I'd looked forward to that one). Even the arcs that various characters in 'Bolt' had (one of the helmers of this one made that one too) is far better than the clichéd way in which plot contrivances pile on in this one, and the angsty emotions go on for far too long in a kids flick. I get it - I am one of the adults that the studio wants to court, but there are better references that have done the job, and though the people in charge try hard, they don't quite pull it off. Conclusively though, it's a big-screen experience, and though it has quite a few pitfalls on its way to its conclusion, there are moments that seem quite inspired, and perhaps that is worth the price of admission. 3D for sure, though there are audience members out there that do not understand the concept of depth (wanting everything to be thrown at them, and only then feel it's 3 dimensional) who might wanna choose the 2D option. Not another Disney classic in the making, though not for lack of trying.",Null,0,17,8 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," We Are Groot
","By this time, we all know the kind of phenomenon this 'little' super(?)hero Marvel movie from the maker of 'Super' and 'Slither' has become. I confess, I was hoping for this, but was surprised at the reception. The nerds can also win!!!Kevin Feige is a wizard. He started doing unorthodox stuff by first bringing Downey Jr. to be Iron Man. he got Jon Favreau to direct it. Joss Whedon for 'The Avengers'. The guys who made 'Community' for 'Captain America'. By far, this may have been his riskiest move, since James 'Slither' Gunn has never been known for anything other than cult, a fact proved by 'Super' as well (one of my fav movies, btw). This guy is a phenomenal talent scout.In an ensemble, including the Whedon movies, each character has an arc, a beat, and a moment to call their own. In this one, the revelation is everyone coming together, and working as one single unit. Don't get your hopes all the way up though - plot-wise, this ain't no masterpiece, since there IS a central Mcguffin again, and everyone wants it, which other things are going on in parallel around the (hic) Galaxy. The end-of-title-sequence has such a high WTF quotient that it needs to be seen for you to believe what the f was just filmed, and on whom (Gross? Heh-heh).By far, my favorite movie this summer, and this has been a summer of greats for sure. I won't list them here, but boy, what a tiring summer! And what a way to ensure things go out - an astronomical bang that this one gives. The perfect way to go would be to watch this on IMAX 3D, though I have not been as fortunate. I'd urge everyone, given your access, to spend that premium on IMAX fare.I'm not done watching this one - I'm sure I'll see it at least twice or 3 times more before it completes its run, and am keeping my fingers crossed for one of those times to be on IMAX. Let us see.The first time I can say that I truly enjoyed watching someone from the WWF have a role, and make it his own. Dave Bautista, to be fair, with enormous support from the creative team on this, does such a bang-up job sometimes that he almost steals away the movie in each/every frame that he's in. Watch him try and rationalize something crucial that his character does, while attempting to 'get' metaphors. Zoe Saldana gets her metaphorical moment as well, and neither appears corny or as a callback, while there was a chance of that happening in lesser hands. Kevin Bacon and Footloose get some fantastic callbacks as well, along with some great 70s and 80s music.This is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long, long time now, and that's such a good thing now that I'm worried for all the ones that come later. Someone needs to do a thesis on how to re-invent mainstream blockbuster fare the way Marvel under Feige have done. Chris Pratt proves all his stupid detractors completely wrong, by 'owning' his moniker of 'Star-Lord' (watch out for that scene which reveals the back-story behind that - I confess not being prepped for that one). It's still puzzling how mature (so-called) critics end up reacting to a character rather than the actor, and I do hope they all hang their heads in something close to shame when they catch this performance. But then, they still might be reacting to the character once again.What's left to say of Rocket Raccoon? Amazing CGI on both Raccoon and Groot, but that's not all. he's as real as embodied by both Cooper and Diesel. You know they love each other, you know what they're capable of, and you simply adore them both. Each and every scene they both are in, singly or together, is a complete hoot, and playing to the galleries, this is how mass heroes should call back to their capabilities.One of the best times at the movies - meant to be watched on the largest screen possible, with perhaps the largest number of people possible, repeatedly.",Null,1,2,10 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Turing's machines
","Having Cumberbatch play Turing might have been considered a stroke of genius, that might have quickly gone awry in the hands of a lesser helmer than Morten Tyldum (the director of 'Hodejegerne' / 'Headhunters', one of the most masterful thrillers of this decade - yep, it's that good), but though (or perhaps because?) I went into this one not knowing what to expect, I was more than happy to find that this was a competently made entertainer, firmly in the commercial realm though (bummer), that showcases of the more closely-held secrets of the 2nd world war, the breaking of the so- called 'Enigma' code by British academia, and holding on to that for a long time, before using it, subversively, to herald the end of the war, without (apparently) letting the Germans know that they'd broken the code.The process though, and the machine itself, doesn't get technical, and that's a pity (with 'Interstellar' kinda doing that successfully for the LCDs among us, me included), since having a 10-minute exposition, even seemingly going over our collective heads, could've been a great value-add to this tale, and perhaps that's nit-picking, since most of the other aspects of film-making are bang-on, including the soundtrack, the CGI and the gorgeous cinematography. This, in turn, is augmented by quite a few fantastic performances (surprise!), from Cumberbatch, Knightley, Goode, Strong (esp. so) and Dance (ordinary, but not his fault - more the screenplay's, which makes him one-note). There are some 'gotcha' moments interspersed within, and that should not be a surprise, since it has become a commercial trope nowadays. It's the quality of the gotcha that's interestingly inconsistent, and doesn't do Tyldum's behind-the-scenes talent any justice (his own doing?). MAJOR SPOILER ALERT for those yet to watch this:The angst behind how many of their decisions actually make them mass-murderers, each and every one of them, was also treated, not quite refreshingly IMO, in a matter-of-fact manner, and I do not know if it was intended to showcase the monstrosity that is inherent in us all, or just the aspect that the makers could not showcase that further and risk alienating the leads further from their audience/s. However, that makes the comeuppance to the lead all the more seem like poetic justice, and the point the makers may have been trying to make against an existing intolerant society go dilute. Therefore, while I have to applaud their including that aspect, it doesn't make for strong story-telling in hindsight.One of the best sequences in the movie? The one between Cumberbatch and Rory Kinnear. Kinda makes us understand why the title was chosen (no spoiler there). It reminded me of the back-and-forth between Gollum and Bilbo (perhaps the highest point in the Hobbit movie- verse), though the intent and execution are markedly different.All in all, worth your time, effort and money in making that trek to the local multiplex, on, preferably, their largest screen possible.",Null,0,3,17 January 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," Housekeeping!
","I was completely unprepared for the surprises in store for me, in spite of having watched the trailers and clips before. Now, I view this as a (kinda) fable, or a fairy tale, if you will, with a dash of sci-fi thrown in, but sci-fi of the supernatural kind. One of the best fusions of hard-hitting ground reality based fictions, that fuses seamlessly with the sci-fi and supernatural elements, and creates a new universe, getting the audience members (those without an agenda, that is, who can appreciate art for what it is, and what it tries to convey - and no, not those who're elitist about it either) to completely dive into its unique world, and get encompassed by the fabric of its storytelling. One of the best romantic dramas out there, as well. And that is an element that sold me on this one completely, in spite of the hard- to-buy aspects of this kind of an entanglement (of sorts, not to be demeaning though). Emily Blunt. A-ma-zing! If ppl fell in love with her after her role as the FMB in 'Edge of tomorrow', but have missed this, I do hope this set of my observations;/thoughts about my viewing of this one influences them enough to check this one out. At least once. I cannot wait for her upcoming movie based on 'The girl on the train'. She was born to play that. And I do hope we get more of her as the FMB in a sequel to 'Edge of tomorrow' (based on the graphic novel, 'All you need is kill'). Coming back to 'The Adjustment bureau', I was hooked. I can now watch this any number of times, and my appreciation for it increases with each viewing.But, is it flawed? Movie viewing is a subjective experience, and in my head, yes, the world it built did not seem to be able to stand on its feet. There were plot contrivances (not contrivances galore, but a few that I found a tad difficult to ignore, but which did not detract in any way from my enjoyment of the flick as a whole). Director Nolfi's earlier effort, the political thriller, 'The Sentinel', was so by-the-numbers decent, that I did not expect something like this from him, in spite of his writing credits on 'The Bourne Ultimatum', and collaborating with John 'Flight' Gatins on writing the upcoming 'Spectral', among others.Among my list of grouses, there's just not enough Anthony Mackie or John Slattery, though Mackie, as always (watch 'Triple Nine' if you need more validation of what I'm saying here), makes the role his own, and gives a solid, grounded performance (grounded, heh!). An underrated gem, imho. Not to be missed. Worth multiple viewings, even better with someone you're really, really fond of.",Null,0,0,21 June 2016
Don't Breathe," True Beneficiaries
","1st things 1st. This movie, is in exalted company. Wait until dark. Cape Fear. Both versions. You're Next (absolutely fantastic). Ils, and it's American remake, The Strangers. Funny Games. A ClockWork Orange. Panic Room. The Purge. Haute Tension / High Tension. The Collector. Pacific Heights. Unlawful Entry. The Raid: Redemption. Yup. Even this one.1 of the things about home-invasion movies is how much more easily the audience-members can identify with the protagonist(s) whose domain is being invaded. Audience loyalty(ies) is/are tested (shifted) every time, with each and every twist in the tale, including one that I honestly did not see coming, that most local audience-members could not stomach, and it IS something that will make, or break your regard for the work that the makers have put into.About character affectations, a very refreshing aspect is how consistent the main leads are, like ppl are in real life, to what motivates them throughout. Overt nods are paid to those (the bag! the continuous unrequited love! the pig-headedness!), and while I value subtlety and being nuanced (in the arts) rather than being overt, in this case, I thought those particular nods were justified, especially in one of the main characters' cases. 1 of the best things about the movie, Avatar's very own 'Quaritch', Stephen Lang, brings, to his rendering of the not-helpless-at-all blind man (pro/antagonist?), an amazingly fluid grace in terms of body language, in each and every sequence he fills the screen with, that hearkens to memory the recent rendering of a similar character, Stick, by thespian Scott Glenn, and also Rutger Hauer's similar (and not-so-similar) act in the late 80s cult-classic, 'Blind Fury'. The camera-work and the framing, along with the set and production design, plus the on-location work, in Detroit, or places that look like it, are absolutely top-notch. The (DI?) color-palette also makes it seem like a movie from the 80s or the 90s, or maybe even earlier, and reminded me of David Fincher's team's work on 'Zodiac' and 'Se7en' ('Panic Room' as well). Also, 'Kill the messenger' and 'Nightcrawler'. A friend also mentioned that it did call to mind the nouveau (almost) 1- long/continuous-take movie, 'Too Late'.The background score is on-target, only calling attention to itself during the B-movie/grind-house style end-credits, which are also a treat to sit thru. Sound design in this kinda movie is one of the lynch-pins the entire narrative has to be supported by, and is more than up to the task. Top-notch, once again. I haven't watched Fédé Alvarez's remake of Sam Raimi's (producer on this one as well) cult-classic, 'Evil Dead', but now am curious to examine his work on that. He seems to have sound-bytes out on wanting to do more original stuff than remakes, with this being the 'original', but the way it has been filmed, this wears its influences on its sleeve, and for my money, though I think it IS good, I would never call this original. 'Room' was original. 'The Babadook' was original (tho it does not belong in this genre). 'You're Next' was original. This one, on the other hand, for all its positive attributes, is anything but original.Btw, and this just a random observation I had while watching this (which did not detract from this well-made movie) - I do not understand why it has to be 3 invaders every time ('Panic Room', anyone? or 'Wait until dark', for that matter, 1 of the pioneers in this genre). Can't it be more/less?It's sad that many people are spoiling the flick for ppl who've not seen it, by revealing the 2rd-act twist online. They're just leaving leftovers for the rest of the audience. Having said that, I know the 3rd act twist, and still wanna watch it again. Not to be missed, especially on the big screen. Not for the squeamish, or the easily offended, either.",Null,2,6,4 September 2016
Inside Man," Not quite literal
","OK, the beginning title starts off with AR Rahman's music (a foreground track, called 'Chaiyyan Chaiyyan') being used for the first time in a mainstream Hollywood flick, the signature track of the Mani Ratnam musical, 'Dil Se', reused here. The kinetic camera style in the initial titles sequence, and various other action set-pieces and heist sequences are consistent with that style (harkens back to Guy Ritchie moviespeak, or even Tarantino), and I don't think I have seen director Spike Lee use that earlier, or since. Our loss, perhaps, since he really does know how make a flick engaging. Since this one came out, though its box-office wasn't that great, it has become something of a cult classic, and spawned movies like 'The town' and more recently, 'Triple 9'. One of those movies in which we're rooting for the criminal to get away with it.But this one was fresh for its time, and peeling each layer brought forth something unseen in the earlier sequences, and the mystery builds up slowly/surely, especially when we're in close proximity to characters played by Foster and Plummer.Washington goes 'Devil in a blue dress' for this, and him being just one step behind the antagonist hasn't just been used for effect. Foster's role in this perhaps also inspired Blomkamp to cast her in a similar role (acting as a bridge of sorts, between multiple parties, broking thing, as it were) for his 'Elysium'.One of the earlier roles from Chiwetel Ejiofor, and he proves to be a good Watson to Washington's Sherlock, though his lack of involvement in the final sequences does raise a few eyebrows, in terms of incomplete characterization and whatnot.Clive Owen, great in every role he does, owns every frame he's in, in spite of the low runtime his character gets (and that's not to say his character got short shrift or something - it's just right). Was also interesting to note that Ejiofor and Owen did get together in Cuaron's 'Children of men' as well.But yeah, this movie belongs to the large ensemble both in-front-of and behind-the-camera, its makers, the writers, the director, the actors and the techs involved in bringing this to life. It's got some great action, spectacular framing, a mystery at its heart that you're genuinely curious about, and the revelations that keep coming one after the other never disappoint, or make you question what came before, i.e., they hold up to close scrutiny as well, and how many movies can say that.The world has been waiting on a sequel, but perhaps wisely, the powers-that-be have not got rolling on it yet. This is perfect the way it is, and I don't know if anything that comes after could prove better.Not to be missed.",Null,0,1,19 March 2016
Mystic River," Perfect - thriller, setting, ensemble, adaptation......
","How much more can one wax eloquent about one of the best book-movie adaptations ever made, Ben Affleck's works notwithstanding? Let me try.It came out in 2003. It was made by Clint Eastwood, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, and was the first Lehane novel that was adapted for the big screen. Its debatable whether or not this is the best adaptation of a Lehane novel, but for me it has scored a 10/10, and I think Eastwood's later work never overshadowed/shot this effort (in a good way, and I've got hope, in spite of the chair). Had quite the ensemble for its time (Its been 11 years already - I feel so old): Sean Penn. Kevin Bacon. Tim Robbins. Laurence Fishburne. Laura Linney. Marcia Gay Harden. Eli Wallach, The 'Ugly' in a cameo. Penn and Robbins both won Oscars, but Eastwood was passed over for direction, and Harden for actress.Tim Robbins has never been this good, perpetually haunted, with a gleam in his eye that anyone could take to mean anything, putting him out of reckoning for the most trusted person to be around.Sean Penn, with altogether a different type of gleam in his eyes, that both conveys love, a fierce desire to protect anyone under his care, only dominated by his desire to do whatever it takes to stay ahead, and be the leader of his pack.Marcia Gay Harden - years of living with, and suffering through ignominy of being associated with scarred people has her continually simmering, and trying to do right, while being as unhinged as her character was in 'The Mist' (OK, not quite That unhinged).Laura Linney - fiercely protective of her own, yet fiercely supportive of any method employed by her own to make it in the world, her character hides her world-weariness by being tough, and staying with her own like a rock, thick-and-thin, all the way through.Kevin Bacon - our eyes, throughout the flick - these are the eyes through which the movie plays out for us (the audience), and this character's incredulity at all that unfolding both during his troubled childhood, as well as during his adult years, when abuse-reaps-more- abuse and loops back in a way that is both fatalistic and reeking of poetic justice.Laurence Fishburne - the only objective one among all of the main characters inhabiting this wonderful yet ultimately poignant tale, but the events succeed nevertheless in punching through his defenses as well.Considering how well Eastwood understands his characters, and allows them breathing space/time in each and every one of his flicks, even the lesser-known/regarded ones, and with me being a die-hard fan (not very objective, though I would like to think otherwise) of his low-key direction, I still remain surprised that he has not surpassed this work, which leads me to believe that Lehane deserves as much credit for this, if not more. Though both Scorsese and Affleck have made great works out of Lehane's books, this remains the first, and most powerful.Considering the fact that I had not read the book when the movie released might have a lot to do with how I loved everything play out, except for the ending, this packs powerful punch, like most of Eastwood's great works from behind the camera, and I'll re-read the book, and re-watch this flick to see how my perception has altered since 2003, when I watched this for the first time.",Null,1,1,2 May 2014
12 Years a Slave," Soul trade
","This one deserves all the plaudits being heaped upon it, and it's interesting that we get to see another 'Southern', without the tongue-firmly-in-cheek brand of Tarantino excess - the other cheek, as it were. Ironic that both Fassbender and Pitt, the couple of Inglourious basterds (that one ended up 'counseling' earlier this year), ended up (not exactly) front-and-center of the other side (the true one) of 'Django unchained'. For the serious part though - this is a story of survival that needed to be told. Not sure how timely this is, but the very fact that humans can, and did, behave the way the characters of Fassbender/Dano/Paulson/Giamatti/McNairy/Dillahunt did, and get away with it all, day-after-day, and got to spout god's name, shows how every goddamn religious travesty had, and still has, the ferocity and hyperbole of fanaticism tinged in each verse, so to speak. The life that Northup had to lead during those 12, the lives he had to tread on, speaks volumes of the absolute lack of nobility in action, and only in impotent intent, that most of us inhabit even today. Solomon Northup may have gotten free, but he had already lost his soul, perhaps for no fault of his.Powerful enough to make a commercial movie-mad audience sit in rapt silence throughout. Not a single call/text (I kid - there was that One call, that went on and on) to interrupt the proceedings, ensuring that we lost our souls along with Solomon. Not to be missed, though sadly not for everyone.Now, will there be a part 2? I'd definitely wanna watch 'Northup and the underground railroad'.PS: I'm unable to get Monsieur Hans Zimmer's music outa my head.",Null,2,6,31 January 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," What's up with so many thinking person's mainstream flicks this year?
","Not just for the masses this one, and its a fantastic trend to see big studios put their faith in talented film-makers to churn out thoughtful cinema in the mainstream milieu.Emily Blunt can do no wrong, and with this, Liman can be forgiven 'Jumper'. Cruise has always been serviceable, but this one's perhaps his best work in a long, long time (never doubt his sincerity - it shone through even in 'Oblivion'). Also, sci-fi, of the good variety, seems to fit Cruise like a second skin. I'm all for it if he manages to keep churning out flicks like this one.Quite a bit of thought has been put into the central macguffin, and though it does have a (kinda) cop-out of an ending, the journey there is enormously satisfying, perhaps to a fault. I know the nitpickers are out there trying to second-guess all the work that's gone on into this masterpiece of an action yarn, but I'm happy, and was along for the complete ride even though I was wiped out when I stepped in to watch this one (marathon meetings - don't ask).Everyone know the groundhog day motif on this one, so no spoilers there. But the reason for its existence was something more interesting than I'd have given credit for from its trailers (even 'Lost' copped out when it came to explaining away stuff, but this one's strangely satisfying on that score). I did Not see that coming, though the final denouement is not all that surprising, and is simple to a fault at the end of it all.The look of the film is suitably muted in keeping with the milieu and the context, but the converted 3D is some of the best I've seen on-screen thus far. I know the subtleties will be lost on most, but I had fun with all the depth on display, and for once, it was built from scratch, from an in-depth graphic novel that got turned into a suitably dense screenplay.Bill Paxton, after a long time, has got a real powerful supporting role to play, never mind 'Million Dollar arm'. With lesser screen time, and almost no action scenes to boast of, he owns each and every line he speaks.The action is supremely spectacular, and the CGI's so good that you won't know where reality ends and effects begin. Never in-your-face, used as much as its needed to be used. I've watched 'Days of future past' one time too many, but I know that I will enjoy re-watching this one over the next few weeks.And if someone was indeed wondering, the creature design for the aliens is very, very good. Suitably menacing, with almost 100% stopping power, though they're categorized differently for narrative purposes, each and every model is poison.With 'The Winter soldier', 'Days of future past' and this one, this summer's turned out to be one of the best for nerds and people who prefer a little meat with their bones.

The meaning of the all- too-relevant title revealed itself once during the movie's runtime, and then lashes back to what I thought it was, going in.What begins as a relentless game of cat and mouse between predator and prey never devolves into something lesser, like they do so usually. No amount of focus is lost in bringing this tale to life and that is perhaps one of its greatest strengths.One of many.What are its other strengths, indeed? What areas complement in the telling if this tale, one night well ponder. Lemme try laying it out, the best I can.The more-than-just-apt production design.

JJJ, oops, JK Simmons, on the other hand, might have been typecast in such a role, but as the movie progresses, he subtly reminds us, subtly first, then powerfully, almost with a sledgehammer performance of sorts, on why we'll never be able to imagine anyone other than him in the role of the single minded genius prospector of musical talent, while surely getting off on what he can get away with. Masterful. Mind blowing. Forget Louis Gossett Jr. Forget R Lee Ermy. Meet Terence Fletcher. He Will get under your skin, claw his way in, dig in deep, and never, ever, leave.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Back to what Marty does best
","Perhaps a review will be better-timed if I get to watch the actual theatrical version that played in normal geographies. Forgive me if I my opinion loses whatever's been lost in translation. This is pure Scorsese-schlock, even vintage Scorsese (not when he veers off-track, in a good way, expanding his range, like he did with 'Hugo', and to a lesser extent, with 'The departed'). Cases in point - Casino, Goodfellas, The Aviator. The first thing I think of when I'm asked to sum up my impressions of this one in a word? EXCESS. Main character engaged in excess? Check. Lots of swearing? Check (not that he tosses them in gratuitously - everything has a purpose). Bimbo wives with brains that can get nasty? Check. Hard-to-look-at+hard-to-look-away-from bursts of sudden, misogynistic violence? Check. Scorsese does what he does best, as does Dicaprio (his pay phone sequence - one of the best to be committed on celluloid, though knowing how snippy the censors were, I'd be hard-pressed to know if I saw it in its entirety), and this could well be the spiritual sequel to 'The Aviator'. Dicaprio's fantastic (I don't really know how well this performance compares with Ejiofor's), but this is Not really stretching the range he's displayed in 'The Aviator', 'Inception', 'The departed' or 'Shutter Island' (I hear range's something Will Forte has exhibited in 'Nebraska').

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," There...and back again
","Well...it's finally over, though it did not show the embodiment of Sauron pre-Mordor. 3 more movies await us, I suppose, and it's all so tiring. However, the action, and the CGI, along with the 3D augmented cinematography, is consistently spectacular, though not as real- seeming as the first LOTR movies were, and I love my action movies gritty and earthy, not as squeaky-clean as Jackson makes Middle Earth look.The LOTR movies are much better than this Hobbit series and its still sad to note all the padding that has gone into this that went into extending the planned 2-movie series into the 3 that finally turned out, but in spite of that, these are deffo better than the Harry Potter works, and I bring that up since they eschewed most of the aspects that were in the books to bring us edited-yet-bloated works, in spite of their quality improving with the 3rd work.Another thing that struck me was that the stupid cliffhanger-ending in the 3nd one was completely unwarranted, esp. since this one continues right after, and the climax for that could have been the prelude that this one made it as. Everything on that aspect screams 'cash-grab' loud-and-clear, and I almost wish I had denied Peter Jackson and WB/New Line the moolah they'd planned for, but they'd have gotten it anyway.Another grouse of mine on this series: the sword-and-sorcery aspect of this entire series, including the LOTR ones, though those did it better, is muted, and this is due to the PG-13 rating that they have to work with. Now, I haven't seen the extended editions of the LOTR movies, and my friends promised me that they had 'fixed' the rating aspect on those, but no one got to watch that on the 'actual' big- screen now, did they? Nope. So, though this one has exactly 3 set- pieces that are beautifully choreographed and wonderfully shot, the 'muted' aspect takes the impact, and dare I say, the fun, out of the proceedings completely. Something that did not saddle a movie like 'Gladiator' or 'Centurion', and those movies were the better for that.A hard-R rating would've been the way to go on this one, and no amount of footage on the extended edition/s is gonna fix that for the big screen.Something else that bothered me this time: Gandalf's sorcery - nada. Zilch. Not a single instance of the great wizard's sorcery is on (dis)play here, despite the so-called stakes that the 4 armies (yeah, 2 Orc armies - Azog and Bolg from Gundabad - really, 'Gunda'bad, lake-town humans - not very substantial but there nevertheless, 2 dwarf armies - merge the fellowship/company with the actual ones that Thorin's cousin brings along, and the mighty Elves: math deffo ain't a strong suit with Jackson, but he's laughing all the way to the bank, and you can bet he can count those pennies). Strange, considering they had that aspect covered with Cate Blanchett, Chris Lee and Hugo Weaving being conveniently on hand to spring Gandalf out of Sauron's clutches.Yeah, so no Sauron, no Gandalf sorcery, no R-action, and bloated run-times. I'd probably recommend not watching this one or the ones that came before, but you're gonna do so anyway, and honestly, it has its moments, like the ones before did (curiously though, I remember 'Smaug', but am unable to recollect a single scene of the first one - probably a statement on the stretching they had to do to make the 2 movies into 3).",Null,2,7,13 December 2014

","Some movies are gonna do well, in spite of anyone trying to recommend them, or not. Now, few reviews I've read on this, before I stepped into the cinema, remarked that this was an inferior sequel, and the focus should have been more on the journey than on the ultimate destination. I have to disagree with that, though the reviewer is someone I do respect.They also took exception to the number of times Dory keeps referring to her condition - but, in her position, if we buy into that conceit, like we did, in 'Memento', where the lead character also keeps mentioning the same fact whenever he got to interact with any other character in the movie. I do wish Andrew Stanton was more ambitious though, but this was pretty serviceable and decent. The myriad supporting characters, including a new hero of sorts, the octopus, an imprinted bird, 2 whales, returning characters from the 'Finding Nemo' pop up to great disposable entertainment. However, at one point, I thought the audience was expected to be too patient with the goings-on, and the number of ways in which the main characters lose and find one another so many times, that it soon gets to be tiring, and more mainstream than anything I've seen in a Pixar flick. This is a fitting 2nd chapter though, which propels the tale forward, and does not need the tag of it being a 'cash-grab' or 'unnecessary' sequel.The 3D overwhelms, and the score has to be one of the best composed, bettering the one composed for the first one. The pace never flags, and there's always something going on, without the characters pausing for a moment of respite. I generally prefer if movies allow their characters to breathe, but this one will appeal to the young-uns with shorter attention spans. Older ones with the same problem also will be entertained.Little Dory is one of the best, cutest characters ever committed to (animated) film.There are flaws, like how, after some time, the malady does not pose heavy plot problems, but they can be ignored, overall. This is a children's flick, after all. But I have to compliment the makers for something - the loneliness experienced by someone with a condition like Dory's, has not been glossed over either, and the pathos of the situation, and the character, comes through strongly, even though that might also be a function of where I might be in life, and what I was reminded of, by my own life experiences. Movie watching is ultimately a subjective experience, and I loved this one, and will watch it a few times more.",Null,2,12,18 June 2016
Arrival," Non-zero-sum game
","Denis Villeneuve, justifiably hailed for his work on 'Sicario', 'Prisoners', 'Incendies', 'Enemy' (with some amazing sci-fi tropes that make this a companion piece to that, in my humble opinion), has quite possibly made 1 of the best sci-fi movies in decades (once again, imho - since there's something that happens during the movie that has kinda divided audiences majorly, even prompting walkouts in a showing I was at - something which I was initially skeptical of, but that grew on me as time passed by, making me a champion of sorts for its right now). This one's been compared both to Nolans' 'Interstellar' and Zemeckis' 'Contact', but I feel it stands above the latter, and comes very close to being on par with, or slightly better than, the former. There is an element within the screenplay that you know belongs here, which plays out in a typical fashion, but the ultimate payoff, which divided audiences, & confused some, occurs towards the very end. Also, another observation made by unkind / unempathetic audience- members was that the epilogue goes on for too long, but, imho, it perfectly capped all that came before, making this more human (or species- centric, considering the subject-matter) than your average sci-fi flick. The locations, effects, cinematography & editing perfectly complement the crisp, sharp narrative throughout, and every department in this flick has made Oscar-worthy contributions this year, I do hope they are recognized for their efforts. The Leftovers ' Max Richter makes his presence felt in both the beginning & end credits, & the overall score by Johann Johannsson elevates each sequence it's used in. The sound design complements the score perfectly, life it's wont to, especially in Villeneuve's works, specific examples being 'Sicario' & 'Prisoners'.Forest Whitaker plays a no-nonsense stock role here and makes it his own, as does Coens' regular Michael 'A Serious man' Stuhlbarg, and they both bring their respective gravitas to (imho, underwritten/stock) roles and yet perform well, but this movie belongs to Amy Adams, whole & soul (supported ably by Jeremy Renner, but this one's is all about Abbott & Costello, heh-heh); but more on her later. I do wish there was more of Renner's character (I've read someplace that many scenes with him in it were edited out, & I do hope we get to see a few of those on the Blu-Ray at least, if possible, in- sequence, though the theatrical cut in this instance is supposed to be the director's cut, from all accounts). I fondly looked back at first having watched Amy Adams in 'Junebug' & 'Enchanted' (interestingly, she's also got 'Disenchanted' coming out soon) around 8 years previously, when I was sure that this actress was gonna go places, and boy, she sure has, if you include her work in this alongside her efforts in movies like 'American Hustle', 'Doubt', 'The Fighter', 'The Master', 'Sunshine Cleaning' (to be fair, I loved Emily Watson's character better in that one, though Adams was the lead, along with the gr8gr8 Alan Arkin), 'Miss Pettigrew lives for a day', 'Julie/Julia', 'Big Eyes', 'Trouble with the curve' (a flawed work to be sure, but she was 1 of the best things about it); and in spite of being miscast in many paycheck movies ('Night at the museum', 'Man of steel', 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'). Absolutely looking forward to her being cast along with Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Sheen & Isla Fisher in the upcoming 'Nocturnal Animals'. It might have helped to understand more about the non- linear part of the paradox that is the central conceit of the flick. Kinda making it a companion-piece to the sci-fi cult classic, 'Primer'.I'm sure I'll be watching this one many times more. Lookin' forward to those viewings. Having seen this, I'm now quite sure that the sequel to Ridley's Scott's cult-classic 'Blade Runner' is in the right hands with Villeneuve. Can't wait.",Null,6,12,25 November 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," (Transformin'?) eXistenZ
","Full disclosure - I missed the first 40 minutes going in, and this is one of those works that merits a second viewing anyway, just on general principles.I did not expect to have a good viewing experience on this one, especially due to the scissor- happy nature of the moral police out here. In spite of that, I was surprised that this did not get much of that kind of police-work, and I say that in a good way, since I was left marvelling at the inconsistency of it all.The first thing I noticed, other than Zach Galifianakis and Michael Keaton bickering on- screen, of course, was the aspect ratio, which, though consistent for the helmer, is one of the most disappointing aspect ratios ever - 1.85:1. I thought I was gonna have my work cut out to sit through this one without continually dwelling on that disappointment.Well, that was not to be, because this is one of the most exhilarating experiences one can have at the cinema. In hindsight though, I did feel that all of this was done for effect, and though the lead (Keaton) strives in giving this his all, it seemed to me, that he always knew that we were in there with him, and save for a few sequences (esp. one in which he speaks of theater criticism, as one who, albeit self-purportedly, some might feel, knows about the process and is disappointed in reading that it has come to naught - quite insightful actually, IMO), and his being safe in that knowledge was somehow off-putting to me. The whole flick being self-referential, kinda auto-biographically, was also something that put me off substantially.Which is quite surprising, really, since I was able to look beyond that enjoy the flick anyway, since the quality of the writing and the setups in the well-structured screenplay, augmented by perhaps the greatest efforts ever put to screen by one of the best ensembles cast in their respective roles.One sequence in which the actress playing the lead's child berates him for something clichéd, and yet makes the scene his/her own, with the tables turning over the defending character's head, was one of the best.The scene where the lead lambasts a theater critic was interesting for multiple reasons, not just for his insights while doing so, but also if one juxtaposed that interaction against another interaction that the same critic has with another lead in the flick.The ingenious use of the 'Batman Begins' voice in the lead's head, which, to me, also called out one of the most reviled (as well as revered, perhaps in larger circles) aspects of Bale's Batman. To me, it was his way of criticising the Nolan-Bale canon, and since I'm in the same corner, it appealed to me immensely.Btw, some might feel that this one has an ingeniously ambiguous ending. I'm not of the same opinion. It's entirely obvious, and those who can't see that, well, I don't sympathize. Painfully (ouch) obvious.The one take gimmick also did not work for me, especially since there were transitions that could have been worked with CGI, and it does not span one night, as I'd originally thought. I should not have read those pieces that dwelled on that aspect, since that led to different expectations in my head, and the end result was a downer, from that perspective.Of all the cast, I thought Andrea Riseborough did not get much to do (except for, ahem, something I though the scissor-happy ones might excise but did not, surprisingly, though I say so myself), but I might be wrong since I did not watch the entire flick. Keaton owns this, but IMO, does not deserve to win an Oscar, not just due to the points listed above, but also due to the fact that, to me, he seemed curiously disengaged from it all, while being aware of being watched (as indicated above). That, to me, is some pretentious stuff, and I don't feel it should be recognised at all. But there will be those who says that breaking the 4th wall by any actor is also a difficult task, and perhaps Keaton deserves to be recognised for that effort. Let the chips fall where they may.All in all, worth multiple viewings at the cinema, and I'll be headed to one of those 'plexes with the once again this week, but in my case, just to catch those 40 minutes I missed.",Null,0,5,1 February 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Nobody does it better...than....
","Marvel. Period. I've had a problem with the writing of various DC properties, but this has to be something like a new low for WB/DC, with almost every plot device being shown as explicitly shoehorned-in, and completely inorganic. But hey, the good things first. Refreshing, how this one, and its predecessor, deal with death, and the impact of superhero smack-downs in the real world around us. From that perspective, there's more meat on the bones here, than in Marvel's theatrical works. Thanks to Frank Miller?The movie looks (Larry Fong, reuniting with director Snyder after Amir Mokri shot 'Man of Steel', and he's worked with his director on 300, Watchmen and Sucker Punch, among others), and sounds great too (Junkie 'Fury Road' XL supporting Hans 'Cymbals' Zimmer, and quite a few great sound designers). What they end up doing, following the character's dark arc with one of the superheroes' nemeses, was also a bold move, in spite of the end cop-out, which, to be fair, there was/is no escaping.Cavill makes for a good Superman, Affleck for a great Batman (almost go DKR on him with some great mano-a-mano sequences given to him, that he bravely shoulders), Fishburne for a great Perry White (wish he'd had more scenes), Callan Mulvey (300: Rise of an empire, Captain America:Winter soldier!!!) and Gal Gadot, shoehorned-in, though not as badly as a few others, makes for a surprisingly great Un-Amazonian Wonder Woman. Holly Hunter and Jeremy Irons are also given good parts, and their presence, as well as performances, elevate the rather shoddy material everyone is forced to work with.SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS.....(but not for people following the development of these properties online)in addn to the main warning before the review. Jason Momoa and Chris Pine look to be cast well in the photographs they appear in (and the standalone upcoming flicks). Tao 'The Wolverine' Okamoto is lovely, and deserved more scenes and better characterization. Why did they not have Grant Gustin instead, since one cannot even see Ezra Miller playing the same character, since he has nothing but a blink-n-u-miss-it gone-in-a-Flash kinda thankless role anyway? Snyder has spoken about it, but his explanation makes no sense to me, given the shoehorned-in context within this flick. Smacks of a big deal being made outta nothing. Now, I will not be watching this again, in any format, like I usually try doing so for those movies I feel I enjoyed, or need to understand more. I do not regret watching this one, its like a juggernaut that's inescapable, and I will be checking out the standalone movies plus both the upcoming JLA flicks - they're inevitable viewing. And yeah, I was waiting for the movie to end. And I've watched longer movies than this one, patiently. The writing sucks, and I'm kinda wanting to pin it on David S Goyer (not Terrio, who has only a few credits, including the Batffleck connection, Argo), due to wildly inconsistent work (contrast Dark City/Blade I and II/Dark Knight/Flashfwd/Da Vinci's demons to the likes of Blade:Trinity/Dark Knight Rises/Ghost Rider:Spirit of vengeance/Unborn/Jumper). It sucks when Batman has 10 minutes to do something, and its something to do with the complete inconsistency of (all things) his suit (not just that, but...). Jesse Eisenberg. One of the worst performances, and characterizations, ever. The campy Gene Hackman made for a better Luthor, while Spacey's chrn./perf. will remain the best, even though it was in a middling Superman movie.The redcapes are coming, the redcapes are coming... The bell has been rung (ergo, you cannot unring it, ergo...) Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding....All the stupid dream sequences. Could have all been completely edited out. The stupid characterization of Scoot McNairy, not just wasting this underrated actor's talents, like they do that of Hunter, but also trying to make 1 character stand for so many things, all at once, all in the same place, and in the same context. Doomsday: the birth. Doomsday=Hulk? Martha? Really? Seriously? And bring me the head of ..... 2016, folks!Diane Lane and her diner TV-viewing, and all of her meaningless/impactless platitudes. Even the Kevin Costner dream- banter sequence (randomly/unnecessarily/gratuitously inserted) was better than when the camera was on her, and this is like the complete opposite of how it was in 'Man of steel'. Lois Lane. Sigh. Why Amy why? Not sure the money's that good, but I honestly wouldn't know that it might be. And why's Morgan Freeman not on-hand when you need him? Not kidding. He was always the conscience in the Nolan trilogy, albeit impotent, but a great sounding-board of sorts. Nolan executive producing this one, to me, did not seem to bring anything at all to the table this time around, unlike his blessings on 'Man of steel'. Snyder's not a bad filmmaker by any stretch, and his rendering of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's 'Watchmen', especially the director's cut, is one of my favorite movies of all time, and that edit is 3 hours and 40 minutes long! He also made a great Zombie movie, 'Dawn of the dead'. '300' was alright, and 'Man of steel' just about passed muster. Sucker Punch, imo, had some great moments, but ended up leaving a largely bad taste, but has to be appreciated for being an original attempt at whatever it was going for, no matter that they PG13'd something that would be more comfy in R/NC17 territory. This, to me, regardless of whose fault it actually was, is Snyder's absolute worst movie to- date, and I am disappointed, since it had many, many things going for it, including Snyder himself.",Null,4,7,25 March 2016
Blade Runner," Just...Beautiful
","Noir. Sci-Fi. Thriller. Action-adventure (OK, not so much). Perfectly cast, with Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Daryl Hannah, supported by Edward James Olmos and M Emmett Walsh.Set in a dystopian future where it is night almost all of the time and raining continuously, where we all end up identifying with the main bad guys (The recent 'Divergent' books do call back to this work if you look closely; among other works, of course) where the unavailable CGI is such a boon that enormous care seems to have been taken to conceptualize and create the miniature sets that they do not seem miniature at all. I think, trying to view this as an allegory that Mary Shelley had in mind when she wrote 'Frankenstein' (The replicants that Deckard is hunting down) is quite rewarding as well.Observing each interaction that Sean Young and Ford's characters have, esp. in the light of the final 'reveal' is also immensely rewarding. Featuring some of the most violent imagery, completely in context with the subject material, along with one of the longest drawn-out climax sequences ever, with perhaps one of the most powerfully-motivated villains, who we actually end up rooting for (I dare anyone not to be 'affected' by the goings-on at that time, and the events leading to it); this is one unforgettable work of art that needs to be enjoyed only on the big screen.Having lived in a region where this was never released theatrically, how did I get to watch it on the big screen? In 2008/9, I was lucky to be living just 40 miles shy of a few independent cinemas that screened cult classics over each weekend, for 2 nights continuously. The final cut of this movie made the grade for 2 such screenings, and I watched it on both nights, one after the other, with a couple of like-minded friends.One more thing about the casting - connecting the dots between Daryl Hannah's performance here, and in 'Kill Bill'. T'was fun - try it.Don't miss it.",Null,0,4,3 May 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," Sav(or) Life....(re)affirm the joy of living
","Never thought I'd like this, but I do - I absolutely adore this one. Tom Hanks IS Disney. But the fun part? This one ain't about him. it's all about Mrs., Sorry, the curmudgeonly Mrs. P. J. Travers, and her journey/s. In spite of John Lee Hancock's ham-fisted handling of 'The Blind side', one of the reasons for which I was not primed for this one, he knocks this one out of the park. Pitch-perfect in tone, execution and characterization, never mind the so-called liberties that may/not have been taken, this is a work of a supremely confident team (its always a team, no matter who helms it), and evoked, in me, some of the best movie-watching memories I've had, esp. watching something similarly layered a few years previously, also on the big screen with a like-minded audience, 'Finding Neverland'. Everyone's in top form here (In addn to Hanks/Thompson/Farrell, we have Giamatti/Baker/Schwartzman/Novak/Whitford), and this is a welcome return to the mainstream limelight for Colin Farrell as well, and Emma Thompson, the eponymous Nanny McPhee, IS Mrs., sorry, Mrs. Travers. I've never enjoyed her performance more (except perhaps in 'Last chance Harvey', another under-seen jewel). The soundtrack is some of the best composed for film, as is the lush cinematography. All in all, perfect, and it helps that the distributors for this one have their heads out of their glory holes, and have released this absolutely wide. Its playing in approximately 12 shows/day across multiplexes, and the audience I watched it with, was respectful, and enjoyed everything unfold with absolute reverence and delight, the way this is meant to be savored. Once more, the middle finger moves around those impatient ^&%$$$s who do not savor the large-screen experience, and 'tis a pity they'll never know what they missed. Better for the rest of us though. Watch it before it leaves cinemas - this one's one of those magical, life-affirming works of art. Take your family, take your better/worse half - savor it. Maybe twice/more. I know I will.",Null,1,2,8 February 2014
Lucy," Rare...to Medium-rare
","By now, this has done OK at the box-office. By now, everyone who went to watch this with 2 things in mind, 1, being the hot Scarlett Johansson being front-left-and-center and 2, being the completely misleading trailer, that perhaps promised Black Widow Pro in this Luc Besson flick, who's also known for having strong female characters all through, in works as diverse as 'Leon', 'The 5th element' and 'Joan D'Arc' (Angel-A as well, but that's for another post), really, really hates this.My verdict? It definitely ain't all that bad. Sure, quite a bit's lost in translation from the way it all begins, with metaphors telegraphing everything that's happening to the lead character, to the ingenious use of sub-titles signifying the lead's ignorance in the beginning, and having become self-aware towards the eventual denouement.Still, with this epic scope in mind, Besson, once again, is in a hurry to wrap everything up neatly. He evokes everything from 'The tree of life' to 'Transcendence', even having Freeman pop-up (don;t think that was a coincidence), but falls completely short of making this coherent when one leaves the cinema. The relationship between the leads is less-than-perfunctory, as is the relationship between the mob-boss-overlord and his minions, and the choice of CPH4 for distribution. I am not a fan of the Michael Bay school of exposition, but this one goes completely the other way, and people willing to give this one a chance and suspend their disbelief were just going, 'huh'? Moi aussi. He takes enormous advantage of the aspect of this plot where the audience has to suspend their disbelief completely, and stretches it to ridiculous lengths. Still, as a fellow reviewer put it recently, if this did not have Johansson in the lead, it might've all been for naught.A lesser effort from Besson, as well as from Johansson. They should've done more, and done better. For what it's worth though, it's 90 minutes of partially-ponderous fun, that's let down by being in-your-face-unsubtle holier-than-thou.",Null,1,5,25 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Cue the drumroll
","Going in,I never had big expectations on this outing as such, since, imo, there was no need for another episode our episodes for this so-called 'epic' saga, that was not intended to be 6 episodes in the first place...and the main twist wad spoilt due to the delayed release of the movie in the local market....just so you know...These notes are based on 3 viewings,2 of them in 3d (1 of which was in real d 3d), and 1 2d viewing on an IMAX screen.To me, this episode, is the best in terms of how all the action sweet pieces are constructed, and are in context with the so-called 'plot' of sorts, in a way that Lucas was never quite able to get a handle on. However, it's such a safe way that JJ does it, following the template set by episode 4, the 1st one in the series, that many have quite justifiably called this outing more than a convenient re-tread of the same.The 3d is great, so that would be the medium to watch this in.The IMAX version allows one to catch the detailing that goes into most of the production and set design, so a combination of the IMAX and 3d versions on 1 screen would be perfect.Mr. Exposition and Ms.Foreshadowing are all pervasive throughout, and that's one of the vagaries in trying to please mainstream fans who're legion. They lead to many disappointing twists that never pay off, but that's part for the course in mainstream cinema.Didn't like much of the blatant world building with pseudo-new characters that are shoo-ins for their established counterpart-templates, and the transfer of the baton/touch could have been a little less obvious, imo.The makers say they have a doozy of a script for the next episode from Looper Rian Johnson, but there's only so much one can do on shepherded process.Acting wise, Ford, Boyega and Ridley take top honors, in that order, and Serkis a well as Isaac do their best with the material given.In conclusion:Thank goodness no one brought back the ewoks or (heavens forbid!) Jar-jar- binks....and I shall watch out for the next episode, and the one after that, irrespective of glue this one made Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac look/sound (watch them in Ex machina instead)...",Null,0,7,6 January 2016
Unbroken," Break it down again
","First off, I haven't seen Jolie's 'In the land of blood and honey' debut, so I won't know how this compares.Secondly, one would never, ever know that this was written by the (credited) Coen bros. Ever. However, Jolie seems to have got the period settings right, and the way she films scenes of harrowing action, thrill and abuse, it surely seems the work of a seasoned veteran, so she definitely has learnt from a few/all of her directors. However, this one compares poorly with other works of it's ilk, esp. 'Letters from Iwo Jima' (coincidentally, Eastwood, who helmed that, directed Jolie in 'Changeling', which was underrated and poorly received, and did not deserve the hate that came its way) and the like, and that does not work to its advantage at all.The new finds, in terms of its leads, also portray their roles like seasoned performers, but it's not enough to set this work of art apart from many that have come before.What was disappointing to me, mostly, was the oft-repeated use of wartime clichés, with this hopping genres from a period sports drama to a survivors' tale and then a POW camp drama, and while that is addressed seamlessly in terms of transition, most of it seems to have been done for effect, and there is no avoiding the clichés inherent in each of those genres. It would have been prudent, IMO, to have avoided those altogether and see how that played. The good parts? The amazing action-sequences, that place us in the middle of it all. The unobtrusive/unintrusive CGI. The makeup. The performances, that do not have the necessary solid characterization to build from. The cinematography - Roger Deakins (to be fair though, this is far from his best work, and nevertheless, I'm calling it out in a complimentary fashion). A few themes in the background score, esp. at the beginning.As far as pacing goes, while it is decently paced, and unhurried (IMO, that is how a movie should be paced), it still could have been trimmed by not having those oft-repeated genre-specific clichés that call attention to themselves, esp. to a seasoned movie-watcher.Conclusively, while this has got a lot going for it, it still doesn't have that vital something that would set it apart. In spite of all that, this is very much a big-screen experience, and needs to be appreciated thus.",Null,1,8,3 January 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Go catch fire already
","Caught fire on Friday itself, but watched it once again tonight on DigiMAX (tired of calling it LieMax - ceasing.desisting from now on, sorry {An}sari). The movie looks great, and I'd have to call it one of the best book2movie adaptations ever (beats, by a whisker, my previous fav YA book2movie adaptation, by Alfonso Cuarón, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'). Lawrence (Katniss) makes us root for this (unsympathetic, if you consider what Gale/Liam H says) character more than ever, along with Josh Hutcherson making Peeta his own, all under the able tutelage of Francis 'I am Legend' 'Water for elephants' Lawrence. This IS the better 'Hunger games' movie, though it does owe everything it is to its predecessor, helmed no less efficiently by Gary 'Pleasantville' 'Seabiscuit' Ross. Donald Sutherland is more than smarmy, and is the perfect villain, and while criticism is being leveled at Philip Seymour Hoffman for his interpretation of Plutarch, I thought it was, like everything Hoffman does, pitch-perfect. The movie looks fabulous, and sounds great too. The final 50-55 minutes make this worthy of IMAX-viewing, considering all the IMAX footage that was filmed (though I'd still have preferred to watch it on a bigger screen than the one in Blr). Among the new characters introduced, those played by Jena 'Sucker Punch' Malone (excellent!), Jeffrey Wright (seen here after his strong turn this February in the underrated/misunderstood 'Broken city'), Sam Claflin (one of the worst things about 'Pirates of the Caribbean 4: On stranger tides', not letting that affect him in the least, completely 'owning' the character of Finnick Odair), Amanda Plummer, Lynn Cohen stand out, ably supporting Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz. One of the best parts about the movie is how the director is Not in a rush to get to the action, but lets everything unfold organically (kinda what I loved about 'The town' or 'Argo') and still when the action happens, there is No let- up. Best part, as mentioned earlier, is this is how it plays out Exactly in the book(s). With Francis Lawrence taking up directorial duties once (nee, twice) again on the 3rd book's movie adaptation(s), I feel the series is in (super)safe hands. More on that below.(SPOILER Territory, so please proceed only if you've seen the movie/read the book/s) Considering this is continuing with the 3rd book, Mockingjay, being split into 2 movies (I'm still confounded by that decision), I kinda expected the final cliffhanger scene to be different, with the intro of a major character that takes center-stage over the course of this tale, but that is the only mis-step that I can think of.",Null,4,12,7 December 2013
Godzilla," Torn - decently disappointing / disappointingly decent
","A mixed baggage, decidedly. Forget about the casting, esp. when there's not much meat there to go around. Everyone around me was criticizing Olsen, Cranston, Watanabe, Strathairn and Binoche for slumming it, but hey, we all need our paychecks. The less said about Taylor-Johnson and Hawkins (and the child actors inhabiting this one), the better.I myself was curious about how they would try to better the sheer awesomeness that pervaded each and every sequence in 'Pacific Rim'. Well, they didn't. They did do something different, by ensuring that the monster-on-monster action was wholly filmed from a human perspective, and that Gojira himself was more a savior, a figurehead of tragedy, a la King Kong, but this one doesn't have the Beauty and the Beast motif going for it that puts us firmly in the protagonists' corner. In terms of scale, this one has it in spades. In terms of plot though, its all meh.There are quite a few action sequences that warrant a mention, and even perhaps a repeat viewing: 1. The train transport sequence, 2. The passenger train sequence, in spite of it being awfully short, 3. The final monster-on-monster action, once again, dramatically short, for a movie that has a 2-hour runtime.The CGI is fantastic, with not one frame looking out of sorts. No mean achievement, that.However, it saddened me to note that the reviled director responsible for the atrocity that was the 1998 version, is responsible for works that have way better characterization like (even) 2012, The day after tomorrow, Independence day et al. Incredibly ironic. The big mistake was in following 1 family. Emmerich gave us multiple perspectives in ID, and though that was one dumb B-flick, we'd all find someone to root for, and stuck with them all the way (even friggin' Randy Quaid).The dumbness. Oh, the plot that serves nothing more than make the movie plod on, clod by clod.......it pervades most frames, right from the time-lines to the sequences set within the quarantine region (floppy diskettes? really?). After a time, I gave up caring. (To be fair, I didn't put my thinking hat on while watching, but typing this, I'm mostly thinking 'huh! huh? HUH????'.)Unexpected from someone with the pedigree that Gareth Edwards has. I really dug his work in 'Monsters', and feel that he should get back to low budget, Indie filmmaking. This one needed Del Toro.And the 3D? An absolute waste. People should re-watch 'Avatar' and 'Pacific Rim', make notes, and then at least try to ape those well-worn works on how 3D would make your frames come to life. Given the choice, I'd prefer watching Pacific Rim once again over this, but its not bad for a 1-time watch in 2D. And believe me, I wanted to like this one.",Null,3,7,21 May 2014

Good for the kids who sneak in, I guess. Oh wait, that's not gonna be the case, since this is rated 'A', supposedly equivalent of the R/NC-17/15/18 abroad, depending on the region. To be fair though, Fincher (and another studio) did release the chopped version of his 'Gone girl', which introduced a new kind of chopping (at the time) where keys sequences remain intact, but the scissor-happy folk try their hand at panning and scanning, zooming into a neutral background, retaining the soundtrack, while eliminating the offending visuals for our 'safe' viewing at the cinema. A lot of that in this flick. Wonders of technology and all that.....Well, Deadpool's supposed to be the Merc-with-the-mouth, in spite of the fact that he wears a mask. Surprisingly, not to protect his identity as such, since mutants in the X-verse do not have multiple identities, but to cover his being burnt. Merc-with-a-mouth means, he's supposed to mouth-off, and we're supposed to listen, reflect/weigh- in, and react/respond accordingly. However, in the local market that I luckily happened to watch this in, I got little opportunity to do that. However, the masters-of-the-scissors do their jobs with their typical inefficiency that few cuss words do slip through, and then the audience started playing the game of 'guess-what-cuss-word-got-muted' all the way to the end (yeah, stay beyond the credits - this may be Fox, but it IS Marvel). I cannot present a fair viewpoint on the version I watched, and my rating of this flick reflects the version presented here. However, assuming I did not miss much in terms of plot, there are a few observations, that may/may-not recommend this one to you: 1. Breaking the 4th wall in a mainstream superhero movie is good, but it gets old real fast (take a cue from Leo doing it in 'Wolf of wall street', where it shows up in just the right amount). So if they're relying on this alone for the sequel, ahem...they just might have to write better jokes. Also, it gets old real fast, except for those who do not know the background about the movie, or about Ryan Reynolds. At a point, it got so I did not know if it was the character breaking down that wall, or Green Lantern, or Ryan Reynolds. Too much of a good thing gets real old real fast. And, heh, he also breaks down that 4th wall for telling us that he broke that 4th wall down. Nuts. 2. The red-band trailers, sadly, have more content that the final local theatrical version, and also does the disservice of spoiling many key sequences for the audience, and that might be felt more in regions which have those sequences intact. 3. Best Stan Lee cameo. Ever. Hint: Think SNL Jason Sudeikis.4. One of the best X-men ever, in the form of Colossus, whose earnestness, used almost as comic relief to Deadpool's own devil- may-care wisecracking hero, this is one character to remember, nee, treasure. 5. Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Go. Watch. 6. Blind Al. Old lady pants. Wish they'd shown more about how DP and she got together, but the one with the growing 'hand' is something most audience-members (heh) missed. 7. Homeland's Morena Baccharin. But. No, not at a local viewing. 8. Only 3 action set-pieces. Tight budget, apparently. And yeah, our mouthy hero tells us that thrice, after having broken 16 walls, per his own admission. 9. Corny love. Earnest love. Mainstream love. Predictable love. Corny...wait, did I just say that earlier. Oh heck...Initially, I thought this was counter- programming for the usual Valentine's day fare. But, if you see the Wade-Vanessa ooh-aah (and remember, minus all the good parts over here...), its just so...yawn...10. The transporter refueled. What's Ed Skrein doing in this one. Seriously. And why's he (the character) there? Doesn't even make for a menacing bad guy. Almost like the excessively self-referential faux-credits at the beginning had to be true, and the real heroes just could not be bothered to write better. Several million drafts, and this? 11. Gina Carano with excess baggage. Had better presence in both Haywire and Fast & Furious 6. Disappointing. 12. TJ Miller could've been utilized more, though his character is kinda funny in the scenes he's given...Now, obviously, I cannot recommend this movie for local theatrical viewing, unless you're one of those that gets off on all the scissor-happiness that's prevalent this month (H8ful 8 got the chops too, in case you were wondering, and there was precious little left to watch, or to listen to, at the end of it all). In fact, this might be my last R-rated movie viewing on the local big screen, for a long time to come, unless I hear of some massive change in the way mature movies are presented to local audiences.And oh, enjoy the smoking and alcohol disclaimers littered across the screen throughout.",Null,14,31,12 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," A true Epic, a true Masterpiece, a true work-of-Art
","Written about, praised, reviled, even censored but never ignored, I finally got the chance to watch Cloud Atlas (http://www.IMDb.com/title/tt1371111/combined) on a small big screen tonight (Sadly, but as is typical in at least 1 of the 3 IMAX screens present, this did not have it's IMAX release in my town - Those who can watch it on IMAX uncut, I sure consider you more fortunate).The audience with me responded very much like how they did to the profundity inherent (but never as obvious) in 'Cogan's trade'/'Killing them softly' by walking out, texting/talking throughout, feeling entitled to do that just 'cause they paid the price of admission (but that's a wasted rant for another day).In spite of such nincompoops, this/ese tale(s) of inter-connected plots found philosophical coherence with me, based on the atypical use of narratives in certain sequences (voice-overs/perceptive views, juxtaposed against multiple tales, though they form the exposition for one). Most of the time, it works, esp. when the (amazing) soundtrack makes it's presence felt, or when the visuals are so sumptuous that they almost detract from the plot(s).Hanks (though miscast in certain roles), Berry, Grant get a fresh lease of life playing a role each in all the tales, and they dig deep to find their characters, since the average runtime for each, never mind the inter-cutting among them, is about half hour. Hugo Weaving is given nothing new, but is serviceable, as are Broadbent and Sarandon. Whishaw and Doona Bae stand out, and Sturgess complements that age group as well.As far as cinematic references go, I sure was reminded (in nice ways) of Blade runner (http://www.IMDb.com/title/tt0083658/combined), Zodiac (http://www.IMDb.com/title/tt0443706/combined) and the Red riding trilogy (more the latter actually - http://www.imdb.com/find? q=red+riding%3A+in+the+year+of+our+lord&s=all), One flew over the cuckoo's nest (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/combined), Amistad (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118607/combined), Waterworld (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114898/combined), The postman (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119925/combined) and The 5th element (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/combined). Those memories did take me out of the movie while they lasted, but I guess that cannot be helped.Tom Tykwer (Lola Rennt/Run Lola Run, The international, Perfume..) co-directed with the Wachowskis (Matrices , Bound, Speed Racer..) and have not had good press for a long time, but I somehow think that they have probably outdone everything they did in the past with this one. Bringing it together and shepherding such an endeavor to fruition seemed to me a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and finding independent financing, along with good casting, vfx and production design could not have been easy.Love it/hate it - do watch it (on the big screen)...and oh, ignore the birthmarks.",Null,1,2,23 March 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Manners maketh the person
","Let me begin by trying to describe how I feel. How does it feel when something surpasses your expectations to such an extent that you have to grope for words to try and articulate how happy you are? Especially when that something happens to belong firmly in the mainstream milieu, something that has forgotten that it can be as fun, as creative, as those blossoming in the Indie milieu as well. That's how I feel.I did not want Vaughn to direct this. I wanted him to do either Kick-Ass 2 instead (I still do), or the sequel to '1st class' ('Days of future past' was made possible due to his vision, though Singer has turned out to be a sellout). But he chose to follow his heart, and his vision, surrounding himself with his trusted team (Jane Goldman for one), who've consistently churned out top-class, top quality fare ever since their mutual association began since 'Layer cake' turned out to be the Bond audition for Craig.Well, to the movie in question: I have not read the Mark Millar graphic novel (The Secret Service) on which this movie is based. Perhaps a good thing. I had read KA2, and was disappointed by the movie. Maybe had I not read the novel (but then again, Vaughn could only produce that, and did not direct).Its a throwback to the Bond (and non) spy flicks of the 60s (maybe a little from the 70s), when the villains motives were simple enough, and dashes of primary colors determined where your allegiances lay. While giving us a close look into the process that dictates candidate selection, it also metaphorically brings to the fore King Arthur and the Knights of (a not so round) table, sans Guinevere. The casting is spot-on, and bringing together Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Mark Strong in the same flick has to be something of a coup. The younger cast is also spot-on, and the tale is nothing like the way mainstream movies treat their imperfect match-ups - the older person and the younger one, the female and the male and so forth. Each and every clichéd plot detail is dealt with in all sincerity, and you will never question the motivations that each character has that takes them in a particular arc/path, or allow the audience even to treat each dalliance as casual.Whilst doing that, Goldman/Vaughn also give us refreshingly surprising, and adrenaline-pumping set-pieces, that surprise, sometimes amaze, and are always dealt with sincerely (that word once again, but how important it is!) and keeps things fresh.There is also a meta element to the whole thing, with characters in the thick of things being self-aware of all the goings-on, their impact on their surroundings, consequences surrounding their actions et al, but not to the point that it becomes (kind of rolling-one's- eyes) distracting. Things are brought up, and let go of, at the right time. Most movies do not get that balance right (here's looking at you, self-aware 'Birdman', with the golden statuette).There are action set-pieces that would be right at home in a hard-R Korean movie, that are pulled off with aplomb, and elicit the right level of shock, awe, disgust and revulsion at the perpetrators of such gross acts. Style is used, but always in the service of the narrative/plot, not just for effect like it almost always is in other mainstream works (I'm looking at you, Michael Bay). To me, this is a signature Mathew Vaughn movie, something he has been capable of since directing balls-to-the-wall action sequences in 'Stardust' (not including 'Layer cake' for now, since that was smaller by choice, in ambition and execution, and remarkably effective for all that nevertheless). Samuel L Jackson, when given free rein, can become a caricature of himself, and I confess that I was bothered about that, and was hoping that Vaughn had not cast him. However, chalk it down to Jackson being aware enough to rein it in, or Vaughn being in complete control of his craft throughout, Jackson's demeanor, character tics (even the not-so-affected lisp, apparently), motivations et al, are in perfect service to the plot, and he makes for a suitably menacing villain, with one of the perfectly nasty sidekicks (front and back too, pun completely intended) to boot. Not menacing enough though, and perhaps that was 1 small almost mis-step in a mostly perfect spy genre thriller.Taron Egerton, who could have turned out to be 1 more forgettable character among all the heavy-weights, should really be grateful to the helmers (Vaughn, and Goldman, + Millar, for sure) who give him one of the most 3-dimensional characters that a young protégé kinda character has ever been asked to enact. His character is treated with a respect almost never seen in movies of this genre, especially in the mainstream/commercial milieu. More points to the makers, and pointers to those who wanna follow suit, whilst crunching studio numbers. Not much to expect, but something to focus on when it has been done right, with this as a showcase to that aspect.Every frame looks perfect, and the score contains a few gems from the yester-years, and are used in a good way. One of the slickest made mainstream features in a long while. All the technical aspects are used in the service of narrating the tale, the way they always ought to be, and never call attention to themselves while doing so.Not to be missed on the big screen, in spite of a few reservations that one might have. Not for the conservative/safe viewer though. you can't please them all, for sure.",Null,4,11,26 February 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," Can the Coens ever go mediocre (Ans: Never!!!)
","Well, finally got to watch this one on the big screen. A pure breath of fresh air, though I do confess, some of the happenings, esp. the aspect with the Deja Vu, left me nonplussed. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd like to have known what transpired before Llewyn goes 'Au revoir' - know what I'm saying?The movie itself is narrated like a saga (the name of the cat holds a clue to one of the Coen bros' references), and has the Coen bros. style all over, albeit subtle. Carey Mulligan is fanta-fabulous in 3 of her scenes, and Oscar Isaac IS Llewyn. He croons with the best of them, and acts his socks off, and being snubbed at the awards must have been immensely painful. I've enjoyed watching him in Drive, Sucker Punch etc., but this shows how far his range can actually expand to. My pick for the Best Movie of 2013. My fav tracks - 500 miles, Hang me O hang me, Please Mr. Kennedy, Fare thee well.......",Null,0,1,20 January 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," Surprise, surprise
","Going in, all I knew was that this one had Thor headlining, and that one/more of the brains behind 'Lost' had dreamt this up. Also, on the negative side, the focus was more on the production, distribution and release delays, which never augur well for any flick, esp. when Thor had something similar going on with the 'Red dawn' remake (and we all know how 'classic' that turned out).Anyway, any fears I had were unfounded. This one turned out to be, simply, one of the most intelligent, and gleefully irreverent take on various genres, including schlock-horror. From one mind-bending twist to the next mind-numbing one, this one doesn't allow anyone to relax, and keeps pushing our buttons all through, defying/sending up all the genre conventions, without descending to parody.The casting and the acting are apt, with Weaver and Jenkins making welcome appearances, and nothing is what meets the eye.Surely the makings of a cult classic - Try ignoring reviews written by morons who give everything away, and be prepped to be pleasantly surprised by this masterwork, the likes of which will be rare to watch once again on the big screen. And yeah, take your significant other, and watch it on the big screen.",Null,1,2,7 April 2014
Joy," Don't come in expecting joy...that for sure
","Well...after collaborating with Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper twice before this one, director David O Russell casts them (in a nail-on-the-head kinda fashion, as he is wont to, since flirting with the mainstream in 'The Fighter') as an inventor, her family members and a business partner, with this one, with the misleading title meant to be ironic, since the life of our protagonist has anything but joy....Always 1-upped by her selfish parents and jealous step-sibling, the movie chronicles her tale adopting (but upping, as well) the style of movies that have chronicled long-standing suffering a lone, righteous women faces, depicted in numerous movies across geographies, but tries not to get heavy-handed with the narrative, or give short shrift to a co-lead, played with realistic, yet dignified poise by one of the most underrated actors of our time, Edgar Ramirez (the new Bodhi, Ares in 'Wrath of the Titans', 'Carlos', 'Deliver us from evil', 'The Bourne Ultimatum'). I'm not sure that many might have felt this, but I did feel that the writers could have tried to humanize the main lead more than they did, by trying to also go across any character flaws she may have had. If one were to believe all the befalls her in the course of this flick, she comes off as nothing short of a saint, and though that may be something kind that the makers wanted to do with the real life character, it also has the effect of keeping her at arm's length from its intended audience (and I'm not talking about the gullible, mainstream audience that laps this stuff up without questioning anything). One of the perfect relationships depicted (there is more than 1) in the course of this story, is the one between JenLaw and Bradley Cooper (they also have last year's 'Serena' to their credit, in addition to David O Russell's 'Silver Linings playbook' & 'American Hustle'), and a lot of people I watched this with expected their characters to align themselves romantically, an urge that the writers did not succumb to, in spite of the many mis-steps they do make. Another relationship that seems close to being realistic is the one JenLaw shares with her father, played by De Niro, who's not the greatest of husbands, but is a decent father, who tries treating both of his children from 2 different wives the same, even at the cost of perhaps being wrong, and choosing the wrong person for a few key responsibilities. However, depicting that is something all actors (including Elizabeth Rohm, also in 'American Hustle') do well, with O Russell's able guidance, of course (in spite of what I referred to about the distance from the main lead). The is not O Russell at his best, but is definitely much better than how it might have turned out if it were directed by someone more mainstream. JenLaw being good is not a surprise anymore, but for me, she seems to be doing her schtick, which, is a disappointment of sorts, since she's definitely both gifted, and someone who can make an effort. However, with the exception of 'American Hustle', once again, to me, she seems to be playing herself in every flick she gets to be a part of, and not as versatile as, say, Meryl Streep, to whom she's often compared to, doing Streep herself a disservice. In any case, she's young, and perhaps can try many more different things over the course of her career. One of the best things this movie does, is in showing a few of the insiders at work in the industry populated by inventors and their representatives in the tele-shopping networks. I do wish they had some more meat in that department, but what's on display here might not have been seen earlier on screen (or perhaps I'm missing those movies which did depict this phenomenon). In any case, watching this movie is time well spent, though I did have greater expectations going in, that were not completely met.",Null,4,10,11 February 2016
Her," Absolutely Riveting
","In spite of the obvious bad edits made in the locally-released theatrical version, this one's a gem of a movie, a work of great intelligence, wit and beauty. Boy was I lucky to catch this with a like-minded audience.A treatise on loneliness and our own attempts to deal with it in different ways, how it would be to interact with evolving, sentient beings in real-time, make this riveting not just for its dramatic potential (which it oh-so-thoroughly mines), but also for its penchant for being a valid entry into the sci-fi trope, giving competition to the likes of Primer, Moon and the like.Phoenix has been ignored by most awards, and IMO, that's all bad form and all that, but anyone watching the movie cannot fail to be mesmerized by the power of his performance, which is of a caliber that almost has no close second, i.e., I cannot imagine another actor essaying this character, or the one he played in 'The Master', in a manner as powerful as he does (the only other actor that inhabits his characters this creepily is Bale). And Scarlett Johannnsson as Samantha (elbowing our the original choice for OS1's voice, Minority report's Samantha Morton - no idea why) is always present in the room with us, and HIM, and you want these two to stay together for eternity. No mean feat that, not even having an animated character to render the inflections of your voice.All the choices made by Spike Jonze prove his mastery of the craft, and this is one perfectly shot and edited work, which also boasts an excellent background score (along with an instance of 'Her' breaking into song as well). Some of the choices made towards the end might divide aficionados, but I solidly bought into the premise, and stayed with it all the way. Absolutely riveting, and will benefit from multiplex viewings as well. Not to be missed, esp. at the local multiplex.",Null,0,1,15 February 2014
Warcraft," Zero 'craft'
","While the movie was (rambling) on, it seemed quite alright, though I would not say enjoyable. Effects seemed decent, acting seemed alright etc. 3D was also decently rendered, for most of the time. 1/2 characters were decent. Not their characterizations, though. Liked the aspect where the makers expected us to fill in the characters' backstories by diving right in. That showed some promise, that was not followed thru, ultimately.Overall, a mainstream/commercial Hollywood movie, for mass audiences only. Feel free to leave your brains home. Surprising, considering they got Duncan Jones to helm it. Michael Bay does action better, and hell, even the much-reviled Antoine Fuqua swords/sandals adaptation of 'King Arthur' did not suck this bad. 'Troy' and 'Kingdom of heaven' could also have been used as decent templates (not going near the fantastic 'Gladiator' for now, just citing lesser works, in the opinion of mass audiences, by virtue of their BO collections and reviews).But, imho, it also has quite a few flaws (to me, these flaws outweighed all the salient attributes the movie possesses):1. Very simplistic story. Players of the game might be disappointed (I did not play - friends used to). No 'craft'. Very little war. Even the 1-1 fight sequences, save a few moments, are completely disappointing. 2. Lord of the rings (3 movies, not including the 3 inferior 'Hobbit' spin- offs) should have taught this filmmaker few things. Nope. They did not. Happy Potter movies had better action/adventure sequences.3. Good actors like Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Ruth Negga, Toby Kebbell and Paula Patton have been wasted on lesser roles (to be fair, Patton's character seemed to have more layers than the rest). Travis 'Vikings' Kimmel, in almost an intro of sorts, acquitted himself well, but has a thankless 1-note character to play, almost like a Rajnikant-type, and could have been used for comedic effect a little more than they tried using him to achieve the same effect. 4. No soul in many departments of the filmmaking 'craft'. Editing, especially. Transitions are too abrupt, and action sequences seem to have been chopped off, resulting in continuity glitches, that, to be fair, an average commercial moviewatcher might not notice immediately. Makes similar glitches in Batman V Superman seem tame in comparison. 5. Blatant cash-grab for the sequels. Good movies are those which place the cliffhanger in their 2nd sequel, not the introductory movie itself. This one might have needed a screenplay re-write before finding its way to the screen, something that did not happen, imho, regrettably at that. Plus, there were 2 faux climaxes in spite of the sequelizing going on blatantly. That also seemed sad, and a result of bad writing. Duncan Jones has made better movies - 'Moon', and 'Source code'. Both of those were smaller in scale. Is this an indicator that he should go back to directing smaller movies? But Colin 'Safety not guaranteed' Trevorrow made 'Jurassic World', which was pretty OK, by any standards (and is gonna direct Episode IX of another 'small' franchise). What about Gareth 'Monster' Edwards going on to direct the decent 'Godzilla', which was also pretty decent?I regret watching this one, but cannot call it horribly bad either. Let down by Jones, and even Foster, who sometimes has the capability to elevate even the most mundane of characters - guess this one was only for the paycheck. Slumming.",Null,2,9,13 June 2016
The Great Gatsby," Sprawling period drama brought-to-life in some of the most amazing 3D ever
","It was an interesting change to watch a Leo movie so soon after seeing him play Calvin Candie, and that kind of timing should help the movie's box-office as well. But, I digress at the beginning itself.How's the movie? I enjoyed it, and thought it was very good, though it is far from perfect. I read the book at an early age (and did not care for it much at the time). It did not deter from my enjoying everything Luhrmann throws at us. Speaking of which, he does not throw much, as he is wont to. Cases in point - 'Moulin Rouge', 'Australia'. I don't know if he elected to go subdued for this one, or if it was a result of Drew Pearce's re-writes, or I've become conditioned to the Luhrmann brand of opulence and excess. In either case, the acting is top-notch, except for the 1-note performances from Mulligan and Edgerton (not their fault really, it's the way Luhrmann chooses to play their respective arcs).The richest role, IMO, surprisingly belongs to our protagonist, Tobey Maguire, and though he also receives a (kinda) raw deal from Luhrmann, firmly sinks his teeth into the material, this being his lead role in ages (not counting 'The details'). Leo does a great job, but we have come to expect nothing less from him, esp. after 'The departed', 'Revolutionary road', 'Shutter island', 'Django unchained' and Luhrmann's earlier take on 'Romeo and Juliet'.The 3D is great, and comparable to Scorsese's use of immersive filmmaking from 'The re-invention of Hugo Cabret'. The production design is magnificent, though I am not the right person to judge if it's impeccable from the standpoint of how it all was in 20s NYC (Comments welcome on that front too; I genuinely would like to know). I also did enjoy the use of contemporary music in this period piece, though I went in expecting to be turned off by that aspect.All in all, a good time at the movies, and deserves to be watched on the big screen for sure.",Null,0,2,23 March 2014
Sully," Grey Goose, a dash of icy-cold Hudson, the 155, and the X factor
","Absolutely love Clint Eastwood movies, both the ones in which he acted, as well as directed, to a great extent. Based on what little I've seen of his mammoth body of work, both in front of and behind the camera, I divide his body of work into 4 phases: Post Rawhide, post his Sergio Leone spaghetti western trilogy, post Dirty Harry, post 'Play misty for me', post 'Unforgiven' and post his conversation with the chair (yes, that happened). I've been (called) an Eastwood apologist too, when it came to defending his work in/on movies like 'Dirty Harry 5:The dead pool', 'Where Eagles dare' and 'True Crime', as well as 'J Edgar' and 'Changeling' (throw in 'Million Dollar baby' and 'Gran Torino' as well, that some did not fancy). Onto 'Sully' then, the first collaboration between an actor of the caliber of Tom Hanks, and the consummate thespian Eastwood (who, by the way, scores this once again, pretty decently, I might add - though I do miss his collaborations with Lennie Niehaus). Regardless of the based-on-a-true-story aspect to this, this makes for a companion piece to Robert Zemeckis' fantastic 'Flight'. So, this movie is not about the event itself, but is about how we perceive heroes and heroism, and what heroism is all about. Like any other mainstream movie that takes itself too seriously, this also treads safe all the way, while ensuring that the main narrative has quite a bit of heft. I remember the media covering this the way they do any event nowadays, and the jingoistic tone of most people in awe of both Captain Sully's presence of mind, as well as the 'miracle' itself. Having followed that when it unfolded, and having watched this movie, I'd speculate that the makers try and stay close to the source material, framing the narrative in such a way that there are flashbacks that are contextual in nature. Incorporating aspects like how the icy-cold Hudson river might have had the last word in, if it were not for prompt first-responders (there are stats that play towards the end that should give various governments and their politicians some food for serious thought to meeting/surpassing the 24-minute barrier - I do hope they don't miss it, with the perceptive blindness that seems more rampant, and even typical, than it was ever before).This has been a good year for biopics and narratives based on true stories, with most makers, even in the mainstream milieu, making a genuine effort to limit their fictional embellishment to a minimum. While that is appreciable, making this tale compelling to an audience that did not go thru the ordeal, the way the 155 did, and keeping the focus trained solely on the Captain and his first mate (a solid Aaron Eckhart), doesn't quite cut it, imho. This is very unlike the technique followed by Greenglass' most powerful work, imho, 'United 93', which quickly put us bang(!) in the middle of action, without making the arcs of the protagonists and the antagonists anecdotal, we felt for each character right until the end.We don't get to know his family, other than perfunctory phone calls between the husband and wife. I could not believe that he did not talk to his children. I still am puzzled by that choice. I think there was something missing. I could understand that the character was numb and overwhelmed, but when you've just escaped with your life, don't you wanna talk to the ppl you've brought into this world. Or, if you do not, why is the reason/motivation for that non- communication not shown?Laura Linney, a fine and capable actress, who was well-served by Eastwood being at the helm in his underrated 'Absolute Power', is criminally underused in this one, along with her character having no kind of an arc at all. To me, it does not make sense casting an actress of her caliber if you do not intend to have her perform to her potential.The contrived way in which one important character gets to understand 'timing' and decides to use it, when it might just have been staring him/her in the face all along, along with touching, perfunctorily, upon how it was a team effort etc., to me, sounded insincere, if not patronizing. However, if Eastwood and Komarnicki intended for the same effect, I think they quite succeeded there. For all those mis-steps, the movie is filled with powerful and evocative imagery, along with quite a few great performances and set-pieces. Eastwood also inserts his own poster (for 'Gran Torino') in a blink-and-you'll-miss frame. Not sure that was necessary, but not sure if everyone'll catch it either. And I will not be surprised if Hanks is nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for this one, though he did better work on another flick of his - Captain Philips (helmed by United 93's Paul Greengrass).As to how I find Eastwood's directorial work on this one? It's not his best, unfortunately. I've been waiting waiting to see him surpass his own work on powerful stuff like 'Unforgiven', 'Million dollar baby' (in spite of all its detractors), 'Mystic river' (for my money, his best, even better than his 'Unforgiven' or 'The outlaw Josey Wales'), 'A perfect world', 'Letters for Iwo Jima' (I still prefer this to his work on its companion-piece, 'Flags of our fathers' in spite of the fact that both were well-made) and 'Gran Torino'. Still waiting though. This wasn't it, and it didn't even come close.Having said all that, this movie definitely needs to be watched, especially by those who do not know much about what actually transpired on Jan 15, 2009. If what's shown here really went down the way Eastwood and the writers told us it did, then being human is something truly amazing.",Null,1,2,10 September 2016
Furious 7," No matter what, gotta keep 'em chuggin'
","Well, this doesn't need a review, or any more time describing it - people are gonna watch it anyway. I have had a nice time watching a couple of FF movies. This one, for instance, but more so the 5th instalment, the one that introduced Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to this series. Fat lotta good that did in this one for him though. You'll know it, when you watch it.This one introduces Kurt Russell and Nathalie Emmanuel (Game of Thrones' Missandei), and continues to stay with Jason Statham, introduced towards the end of the previous instalment. However, even though we know this, heralding the inevitable sequel seemed extremely cheap to me, almost undoing the dignified send-off that the makers and the actors seemed to have planned for Paul Walker. Maudlin activities were completely cheapened, IMO. Ali Fazal's introduced as well, but mostly as comic relief, along with Tyrese Gibson, whose treatment, and response/s, do raise a few tired guffaws (simply not fresh anymore). Speaking of which, for most of the cast, other than few of the main leads, seems like this is the only avenue they have to be viewed in the mainstream milieu, and that's kinda sad, in a way.Casting-wise, Jordana Brewster has been getting a raw deal since 2, perhaps (though her role in 5 was substantial enough), and she's given company in that department by Elsa Pataky, who was utilized much better in 5. Djimon Hounsou, who's capable of much better things than being Universal's thug-for-hire, both here and in 'Guardians of the Galaxy', fares the poorest, not getting his moment at all, even though both he, and his character, merit many such mainstream 'moments'. Happily enough, a badly-marketed/credited Tony Jaa finds 2 fantastic moments to shine, and boy, does he craft some fantastically choreographed action-sequences. Why was he not there more, and why was he not at the helm of all the action-choreography. Statham could have been utilized more effectively, in his hands, for sure. And we might have got the kick-ass action movie this had promised to be. However, and here's where the makers know they are firmly in their niche, and won't indulge fanboy whims such as mine - this is all about the cars, and nothing else (sure, bikini-clad women too, but who's peeking?). In that department, this stays true-to-form, with multiple models making an appearance, and seemingly causing motogeeks to salivate at their sight, and reach the throes of you- know-what.Based on this instalment, and the last one as well, the so-called well-oiled engine behind the series seems to be running smoothly, and though Justin Lin upped the ante with 4 and 5 (though he also has the middling 2 and the passable 3 to his credit, in addition to one of his best works, 'A better tomorrow' making for perhaps the best entry in his directing filmography, rather than this repetitive flicks), but James Wan directs unrealistic-action as competently as his mainstream counterparts, and I'm sure they can hire cheaper directors to work on the next instalments. Oh, don'tcha worry - they're sure waltzing our way, sure as a hurricane, sure as taxes.Luke Evans' presence is teased for this one, but not fulfilled, since his big bad bro is at the helm of exacting his own form of revenge, which means being at the beck-and-call of the director among our heroes, as/when he's needed to remind us what this one's actually about (not God's eye). Strangely enough, I ended up missing Gal Gadot and Sung Kang too.And the Mcguffin. God's eye indeed. Did not belong in this movie. This one could have been so .... mission impossible, maybe even much better than the 'Rabbit's foot'. So much could've been done with that. Still might, since most of Hollywood seems to think nothing of cannibalizing what their peers make, even recently (Run all night / Road to Perdition etc.). The movie is extremely noisy, and I picked a 2D screening, so perhaps I was spared the additional effort of squinting at the screen using fogged-up/unclean 3D glasses. I'd love to do without 3D if this is the way almost all of my local cinemas choose to handle the glasses that they charge unduly for. I love 3D, if done the 'Avatar' and the 'Dredd' way, but given the option with the local cinemas ruining the viewing experience, I'd rather view movies in 2D.Now, I know this review is not gonna affect mass-viewings, and that's sad since the makers know this, and this has become a huge juggernaut, and fanboys and girls are already looking forward to hearing sound-bytes about the next instalment. I do wish they had maintained a respectful distance to that in this one, due to the untimely and unfortunate demise of Paul Walker during filming (the CGI is clearly evidenced where it was applied, and I don't know if I was one of the few people who had an outta-movie experience whenever that was done).",Null,0,2,4 April 2015
