Source Code," Great movie for sci-fi fans
","I can't really tell you much about the movie without spoiling it. If you like science fiction and mystery, you will like this movie. Less you know about it, the better.Here you follow the main character. When the movie starts, you know just as much of what's going on as our main character does: Nothing. That's how I started watching and it worked.The movie kept me interested all the way to the end.. and beyond. At no point did I think: Boring movie, gonna press Delete on this one. Some movies I liked: Fifth Element, Blade Runner, Scorpion King, Conan. If you liked all of them, just get this one too. Although the movie has nothing to do with any of those.There aren't any super cool special effects. This one just keeps you interested because it's a mystery without unnecessary drama. Movie you will be pleased to have seen, because it was interesting fiction. Not because it had 20+ explosions. Not boring at any time. Rare thing.So far, I've tried to convince you to watch it without saying anything to spoil anything.This will reveal something about the movie and you won't experience it with empty mind like I did if you read the below. So go somewhere else and stop reading. NOW! @###################@Our main man is asked to prevent a bomb going off in a train he is in. He will soon learn that it is the first step to prevent the death of millions, that will happen if he fails.",8,0,1,12 June 2011
Warrior," Common, non-thrilling boxing movie
","I gave it a vote of 4 because I've seen this stuff before. This movie wasn't something you could consider a fighting movie, because the action is short and not shown.This is a movie where the main character is trying to earn money by fighting in a ring. Thrill, action and suspense have been replaced by drama.The plot is the fighter's relationship with his original family. And I don't think people who like drama will ever watch a boxing movie. There is no background provided for the people he's fighting. Our hero just goes and pummels his opponents and you're supposed to be impressed. This is an uninteresting movie. No thought was given to his opponents.This is just about a poor guy trying to get money for his family, while resolving his issues with his father. Even the fight scenes are pitiful, you can't really see anything as far as the action goes.I can't believe the IMDb score made me watch this crap. It's a drama. As anything else, it misses all points.",4,9,21,16 December 2011
