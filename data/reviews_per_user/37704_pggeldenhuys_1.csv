Skyfall," Was this made in 1952?
","The only good thing about Skyfail, is the new Coke add before the movie. For the sake of not repeating what has been said before, let me simply state the following, what is James Bond? In my mind he's suppose to be 'The Man', a slick, suave, highly trained, highly skilled, Secret Agent from Mi6, who with the aid of a really cool 'never been seen before' gadget from the ever comical Q, defeats the enemy or at least makes their lives difficult. An agent who always accomplishes his goal, with a fair bit of womanizing on the side, funny one liners and super exciting expeditions etc. In short he is the guy every man wants to be and every woman can't resist. In this installment he literally fails at every single task assigned to him, he loses the list, gets shot, has depression, turns into a drunk whilst AWOL, comes back, fails all the training tests assigned to him scoring 40%. Then Fails to protect/keep alive the only girl worth mentioning in the movie. Then he captures only to lose again the baddie (Who is a Spanish or is it Mexican ex Mi6 agent, how does that happen?) in broad daylight, then he barely gets M away to his 'fortress' family home in Scotland, where there's only a single Scottish (With out an accent of any kind) gamekeeper with one gun, where he fails to keep M alive (Great choice), the only thing he accomplishes all movie long is to kill the baddie, with an knife after not sustaining hypothermia some how, who was already trying to kill himself, so no points scored there. Does this sound like our British secret agent hero? As technology move forward into a TRON like age, Bond and Q moves into the 50's. The best you can do is a gun with 3 LED lights and a radio the size of a small cellphone? The radio was invented in the 1800's pal.It feels like this movie was shot in the 50s with a 70 year old director and his 32 year old daughter smitten with twilight, having said that Twilight was better, much better!The movie ends with bond being assigned a new mission, from the new M. M must be thinking 'Now this is exactly the type of guy I want protecting our country, the guy who's getting old, can't shoot straight, has issues, is an alcoholic, poses way too much, has no skills other than running through walls, and the uncanny ability not to die, and to boot killed my predecessor . . .' The only thing Secret about Bond is how on earth it managed to get its rating, at time of this writing its 8.1, did they pay 100 000 people off to go vote? Without a doubt the WORST BOND YET!",2,18,37,3 December 2012
