Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A really great B Movie!
","I love Star Wars!!! For years I lived and breathed nothing but...! It has gotten me interested in everything from comparative mythology to zen buddhism to Kurosawa. So, yes, I was expecting way too much when I went in to Phantom Menace. After being blown away with visuals on the first viewing, like many, I picked it apart in subsequent viewings; picked it apart so much I actually hated it for awhile. The very thought of Jar Jar made me angry! Sure Maul was cool, but you hardly see him. Midichlorians??? What the f#*%??? Doesn't that totally undermine the spiritually inclusive dimension that is 'the Force'???And then, time passed... I watched it again... I discovered that it was in reality a B movie; a REALLY expensive B flick, but nonetheless B. Then I learned to enjoy it for what it was. The story is still weak. But look at it this way, Lucas is the ONLY member of the original creative team inolved with the film. And, if you do your research, Gary Kurtz (the producer of IV and V) was very important to the creative development of the core concepts of Star Wars. Kurtz called it quits after Empire due to creative differences; Lucas went to cuddly and cute, whereas Kurtz wanted to keep it bittersweet and dark - more in line with the original concept. If your interested check out the book Empire Building.Anyway, enough of what could have been... I must admit that as May 16th closes in I am getting excited. Samuel L. recently said episode II was the real first film, and Ewan M. said it was  brilliant. We can only hope...",6,0,1,19 February 2002
