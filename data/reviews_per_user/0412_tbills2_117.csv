Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill: Vol. 2
","Figuring out which Kill Bill is better is pretty tough. The 2nd may be. Quentin Tarantino strikes back with a vengeance in Kill Bill Vol. 2! The 2nd Kill Bill is entirely different from the 1st Kill Bill. Kill Bill 1 is action-filled and stylized at a fast pace. Kill Bill 2 is loaded with lengthy dialogue and suspenseful at a slow pace. Both volumes just so happen to be great. They're only different kinds of movies yet still one single movie. The 1st volume has the more centralized story with a more standard story progression while the 2nd volume has a more drifting story focus with a less standard developing story. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 isn't completely crafted as presentably well as Kill Bill: Vol. 2 but Kill Bill: Vol. 1 has way more substance to its story, while Kill Bill: Vol. 2 has less substance to its entire story but is presentably crafted better than Kill Bill: Vol. 1 but Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is also the more difficult movie to presentably craft completely because it has better material substance. The 1st Kill Bill has overwhelmingly more edited detail to the picture and story. The 2nd Kill Bill has a more complete technical value to the picture. Kill Bill 1 has more action sequences with exciting exaggerated effects. Kill Bill 2's action sequences are more naturally toned down. Kill Bill 1 keeps things generally on the surface. Bill 2 goes into more depth. Kill Bill 1 is better, but Kill Bill 2 is so close that it doesn't even matter, they're both great! I can say that Kill Bill 2 should have used more action dominant plot points and twists and turns; the movie feels to fail at impressing Vol. 1's adrenaline pumping action. Kill Bill: Vol. 2 does though have its fair share of seriously sick substance though! The moment when The Bride is captured and buried alive by Budd through to the moment when The Bride snatches Elle's eye out is all simply delicious cinema enjoyment! The beginning, before about Budd and the wedding chapel is very good, and the end, after about Bill and Beatrix Kiddo and B.B. is very good, but all of that middle, the middle about Budd and The Bride and Master Pai Mei and Elle Driver and the lonely grave of Paula Schultz and the cruel tutelage of Master Pai Mei and The Bride and Elle's sweet samurai sword fight in Budd's small little trailer is Kill Bill Vol. 2 at its most unstoppable best! Uma Thurman is unreal, my God! Daryl Hannah, David Carridine, Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu, and Vivica A. Fox makeup the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad, and they are amazing in it! Kill Bill 2 is sure great, but the way it chooses to steer away and try to expand upon The Bride's revenge on Bill main plot line is done admirably and interestingly and terrifically but pointlessly. It should of just stuck to the whole point of the matter, The Bride's revenge versus Bill, and delivered the goods like the 1st one did with an epic and over the top, action-intense, Quentin Tarantinoesque final showdown ending with Bill vs. The Bride! All that said, Quentin is the man, and I cannot wait for the 3rd Kill Bill because the 1st 2 Kill Bills are really, really awesome!!",8,2,4,6 April 2014
Scarface," OK, I'm Reloaded!!!!
","Ya, you are right...Scarface is poorly written...the dialogue is too simplistic. Do you even know who Oliver Stone is? The person who wrote Wall Street, Platoon, and about a half-dozen other classic films, just got it wrong, huh? More like you got it wrong. Aside from Goodfellas, I feel Scarface has the most realistic dialogue of any movie. None of the lines are romanticized, it all seems natural and true. Do you think a Cuban refugee turned drug kingpin is going to be an elegant and articulate speaker? Tony Montana is a savage, and Al Pacino does a truly awesome job of portraying him. Scarface is seriously one of the most entertaining movies ever. The only knock on it is that is does not have great depth, but that's just comparing it to the other all-time best films. It has plenty of subtleties going on though, thanks to Oliver Stone. Here it is - Scarface has more great lines than any other movie, ever.+ Hector the Toad: So, you got the money? Tony Montana: Yep. You got the stuff? Hector the Toad: Sure I have the stuff. I don't have it with me here right now. I have it close by. Tony Montana: Oh... well I don't have the money either. I have it close by too. Hector the Toad: Where? Down in your car? Tony Montana: (lying) Uh... no. Not in the car. Hector the Toad: No? Tony Montana: What about you? Where do you keep your stuff? Hector the Toad: Not far. Tony Montana: I ain't getting the money unless I see the stuff first. Hector the Toad: No, no. First the money, then the stuff. Tony Montana: (after a long tense pause) Okay. You want me to come in, and we start over again? Hector the Toad: (changing the subject) Where are you from, Tony? Tony Montana:(getting angry and suspicious) What the (bleep) difference does that make on where I'm from? Hector the Toad: Cona, Tony. I'm just asking just so I know who I'm doing business with. Tony Montana: Well, you can know about me when you stop (bleeping) around and start doing business with me, Hector!",10,0,1,3 July 2010

It," I love It. It's really good. It's really not that scary but It kept me thrilled from the beginning to the end. I want to watch It again as soon as It's over 'cuz It's so good!
",It is. I love it and I love Sophia Lillis! She really nails it! I hope she winds up becoming a big time star. I know that she will. I love her and I love It! It could of used way less cheap digital effects scare tactics and way more plot-driven terror but it doesn't even matter because It rules! It's awesome! I wish I could score It a higher score but it sucks and it's just too randomly pieced together at times plus Pennywise is not scary at all.,5,0,1,14 December 2018
John Wick," John Wick - Best Video Game Ever???
","John Wick is an awesome video game and one of the best third-person shooters I've ever played with incredible groundbreaking graphics, a handsome lead character to control in John Wick, and a more clever story premise than you might realize. What's that? John Wick is a movie? John Wick is a movie. John Wick, is a movie. That explains why I was so good. No wonder. John Wick has a video game plot, video game action, a video game reality, a video game mentality, video game art, lighting and text, and a bunch of random dudes popping out out of nowhere getting shot one by one like they're in some video game or something. Keanu Reeves kicks serious ass as John Wick and I laugh at the thought of people who don't think he's a good actor. Reeves is John Wick. Keanu Reeves is really cool. John Wick is really uncool. I love puppies as much as the next guy but not as much as John Wick apparently. John Wick's 75 man kill count speaks volumes. John Wick has a genius story premise with well choreographed and very well shot stylish action that is fun but not that suspenseful. John Wick almost has too much pointless violence but they did mess with his puppy and it is such a pure action film.",6,0,8,23 February 2015
Erin Brockovich," Erin Brockovich is 1 of the best movies ever - Julia Roberts is THE best woman ever.
","I love Julia Roberts. She's more than beautiful, Julia is godlike. Erin Brockovich is more than just a great movie. Roberts' perfectly ideal as Erin. Julia's performance rivals any performance or whatever you wanna call it by any actor or actress or whatever you wanna call them or anybody or anyone or anything done onscreen ever in the history of the infinity of humankind or womankind or mankind of all-time. I love Julia. Julia as Erin is absolutely awesome and extremely sexy. I'm arriving at the very cusp of realization that I love Julia more than any other woman, any other man, or any other person in the history of our time or anyone else's time. She looks nice. I appreciate this movie and the real Erin Brockovich so much. Julia's fun! I want to be with her way more than Aaron Eckhart's character. Older-aged Finney is the best and most memorable Finney. Julia's got a great smile man, or woman, with the most deeply beautiful bright brown eyes and fiery orange red hair and beautiful so big pink lips and a great body. I feel like this film's subject matter is entirely relevant and significant in today's times, or yesterday's times, or tomorrow's times or anyone's time for that matter. Julia, I've neglected you in my life for awhile now just a bit but I ain't doing it any further and I promise you as a young buck I used to love you more than anyone else and for some reason I lost that but it doesn't matter because I've rediscovered it now, my passionate true love for you, in my life. I love you Julia Gulia. Erin Brockovich rules!",8,4,5,10 May 2018
Se7en," Se7en is an epic experience!
","Se7en is sick! I am almost still surprised today that this film turned out to be so good. I guess it blindsided me, like many films have, but in a truly refreshing way. What I mean is this movie could have easily fell into the realm of normality, just another run-of-the-mill movie, but it didn't. It far surpasses the common film, and I am telling you the truth when I say it is the greatest murder-mystery of all-time. It is. Some might disagree because Se7en is so savage, and even a little vile, well, it's vile. But it is so beautifully crafted; it is so powerful. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give phenomenal performances, not to mention Kevin Spacey. And the story has such a good theme and identity to it. You really feel what's going on. You really feel for the characters. The subject matter is obviously very dark, but that does not mean that it's not a gorgeous film. It's very touching, very beautiful. Se7en offers a full range of emotions for the viewer. I really love this movie. I give it a pure 10 out of 10. Se7en is a masterpiece for the ages!",10,0,2,24 August 2010
The Big Lebowski," The Dude sure does rule
","The Big Lebowski is a laugh-out-loud comedy, one of the all-time greats. While it may not be so uproarious as other comedy classics like Caddyshack or Dumb & Dumber, one thing distinguishes it from the lot making it special, it's actually good. It's a good movie. It is good in the dramatic sense. That puts it in rare company with flicks such as Raising Arizona. If there were only some link tying those two...Oh! The Coen Brothers! What a coincidence, these fellows are unbelievable! Someone might consider giving these two an award or some sort of a commemorative plaque. Ethan and Joel know their stuff. Watching The Big Lebowski and expecting a workable storyline or plausible happenings would be missing the point entirely. The true splendor of this film lies in the viewing ebbs and flows, the sweet spiritual journey endured, dipping into a tranquil pool of camaraderie and tolerance while emerging a cooler, wiser person. The Big Lebowski is fully enriched with life-learning moments. Take it from The Stranger if not from me. Sam Elliot's narration is great. The pacing of the film is precise. The writing of dialogue and the characters themselves are stupendous. The acting is first rate. Jeff Bridges gets the role of a lifetime playing The Dude. John Goodman is unforgettable as Walter. John Turturro as Jesus is so funny. The enjoyable experience of The Big Lebowski is simply lovely.'Take 'er easy, Dude. I know that you will.'",9,1,3,30 April 2013
Fight Club," Fight Club is One Helluva Ride!
","This is a 10 out of 10. This is a true 4-star.Based off all these critics' reviews, a lot of people just don't get it. They don't understand, apparently, how else do you give Fight Club 2 stars?!The fact that Fight Club is so highly regarded on this site, just proves that once again you critics got it wrong. I feel sorry for people who cannot enjoy and recognize the beauty of this film. There is no other movie that's like it.It's so, so original.It's one of the top visual movies ever really, and it's immensely entertaining. Pitt and Norton give great performances. The characters are unlike any ever before.Fight Club's very well written; it has such absorbing and interesting dialogue. The narration is great.It's truly a movie that inspires you, but maybe that's not a good thing...Fight Club is in your face, ruthless entertainment. Movie lovers are blessed to have such a fine film as apart of their collection.Tyler Durden will live on forever!",10,1,3,27 August 2010
Passengers," Gosh I Love Jennifer Lawrence
","Passengers has a brilliant sci-fi premise, solid sci-fi special effects, and brainless sci-fi writing. The hibernation pods preserve a person in suspended animation for decades upon decades but once they turn off you can't turn them on again. It's impossible for them to malfunction accept for the fact that, oh wait, they just did so now I'm awake and stuck all by my lonesome left to die on a spaceship traveling on autopilot to some distant planet in 90 years that I won't see with no crew or captain around because their asleep and nobody else around, except, oh, there is somebody else around, there's actually a bunch of people around so I don't have to be all alone at all because I would just wake a bunch of people up starting with the sleeping beauty Aurora, tell her I did it, and live my life happily ever after with Jennifer Lawrence by my side and the rest of our colony of cool looking passengers. There's absolutely no controversy and zero conflict in doing that, especially if the ship that's in control is going so haywire and I can't fix anything or get back in my hibernation pod or weld through the escape pod doors and it takes 50 years to communicate a message back to earth plus I can't get a decent breakfast or coffee because I'm not a gold pass passenger and the only fun things to do are walk around on the outside of the ship in magnetic space boots and float around in space in space suits and jump on my bed and play dance party video games with no partner and basketball by myself and watch movies with no one and eat sushi and drink liquor by myself and my only buddy is an android bartender that looks and talks exactly like Michael Sheen. I'd be a pretty good free throw shooter but in a heartbeat I could be playing basketball 1 on 1 with Jennifer Lawrence.....yes, pretty sure I'm waking up Jennifer, dude. The passengers all took a risk. Passengers is almost sexy. Jennifer lets her butt out but I can't see it. Jenn's naked body looks like the dark side of the moon. Is a solar eclipse happening? The light on Jenn's butt is dimmer than a dying star. The shadow on Jennifer's glutes is darker than deep space. Lawrence's back is blacker than a black hole. Jennifer Lawrence's booty has less light on it than.....than a sunless galaxy. Ok, look, I love Jennifer Lawrence, and I'm definitely going to buy Passengers on Blu-Ray, but can I please see Jennifer, the hottest girl in the universe's side butt in natural light without all the dark shadowy effects? Gooooosh! Isn't there a sun nearby? I got to see Chris Pratt's butt full on, sexy for the ladies, but not so much for me. I would have given Passengers a 6 if not for all of the awfully cut Lawrence hot scenes, like when she goes swimming in the gravitational pool too, because it would have been way better. It actually would have been awesome.",5,1,2,10 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl!
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a bona fide classic, one of my 50 favorite movies! Capt. Jack Sparrow is a hero for the ages! brought to life by the lovely Johnny Depp. Depp gives a swashbuckling original performance. Curse of the Black Pearl is high seas adventure to the very end, barrels and barrels of fun! It's good and fun for every last second! Captain Jack's character introduction is excellent, at the very beginning when he first steps onto the docks from his sinking sail ship, I love that! It reveals Jack's sloppy and resourceful being as a pirate. Depp acts brilliantly and totally brings out the best in Sparrow. He acts like a drunkard. I can imagine how much fun this role would have been for Depp. The nomination was good but he should have brought home the Oscar. Orlando Bloom's attractive as young Will Turner. Depp and Bloom alone are plenty amusement for the ladies. Keira Knightley looks amazing as Elizabeth Swann as she's wonderful. She's just too good of an actress, better than even Rush or Depp. Geoffrey Rush is great as Barbossa, a creative and fun villain. The 1st Pirates of the Caribbean is the only one worth its weight in gold. The sequels pale in comparison. Each of the Pirates of the Caribbeans are worthy for Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack character if nothing else, but the 1st Pirates is the only one that's really well-crafted. Curse of the Black Pearl has great writing, gorgeous cinematography and sharp, learned dialogue. I love the visuals of this film! Pirates is funny and is one awesome family adventure! Pirates of the Caribbean is a great tale filled with interesting characters, pretty landscapes, and extravagant sets. It's really always a good viewing, it's harmless fun, and it never grows old! It'll really lightens your spirits. Pirates of the Caribbean is stylishly artful, but also, it's really very fun!",8,0,2,4 July 2013
The Danish Girl," The Danish Girl & The Swedish Girl (Eddie Redmayne & Alicia Vikander)
","I love Alicia Vikander she's eons beautifuller than mother nature showcasing her naturally flawless gifts in The Danish Girl, bringing a real exuberant passion to the work and such pure spirit and elegant nature with unblemished enthusiasm, raw, unbridled attraction and the softest, most kissable luscious features I've ever seen on a woman i.e. her boobies and her super sweet nips and her bare ass and her lips and her face! Her gorgeous, silky face with her perky sweet lips and soul piercing eyes and ultra puffy cheeks O M g Alicia Vikander I love her she has the body of angelic titan! I'm sorry, I got carried away. I apologize. Alicia is a goddess and I want to paint her naked. Eddie Redmayne is gorgeous and charming with beautiful blue eyes and he's a nice actor. Alicia Vikander makes my world complete I dearly adore her through all phases of sexual enlightenment - lust, desire, sensuality, seduction, temptation, sexuality, desire, passion especially passion, moral virtuosity that's important, did I say lust? I love you Alicia. You're gorgeous! You're an UBER Swedish hot gorgeous babe to the highest degree and altitude! TDG is exquisite, artistic, and incomprehensibly dull with little real merit to the real world we live in today. I love Alicia Vikander more now after viewing this. Eddie is good. I love Amber Heard!",5,1,2,6 January 2019
The Girl Next Door," The Dream Girl Next Door, Elisha Cuthbert
","Matthew Kidman, Emile Hirsch is really smart and really hot but for some odd reason he can't get any vagina in high school I think maybe he studies too hard or he doesn't go out enough or he just cares too much about what other people think but the truth is it's tough to score hot girls in high school sometimes and he's probably real shy too and like scared to open up or maybe be rejected. ENTER ELISHA. O m G!! Elisha Cuthbert is SO HOT in this movie, she's like the dream girl next door, plus Elisha achieves her level of A+-SUPERHOTNESS without showing any nudity. I love Elisha Cuthbert and she deserves a better career in Hollywood because she's a true star. (Not a porn star, but I do love porn stars too.) I will always remember... Elisha Cuthbert in The Girl Next Door, and how purely sweet she is, and gorgeous.",5,1,4,10 August 2018
Spider-Man 2," Cheesy, lame, Hollywood......UNSOPHISTICATED!
","Spider-Man 2 got 4 stars.......this makes me question everything I've come to know. That's insane; talk about watering down every other worthy 4 star movie, Spider-Man 2 is in the same class as Forrest Gump, Titanic. You know I don't want to make some elaborate point as to why this movie is not a 4-star classic, so I'll just say this. SPIDER-MAN 2 IS NOT 4 OUT OF 4 STARS! There, cleared that up.Oh I can't submit my review until it's longer......uggh.Um....the characters here are horribly portrayed. They're not realistic at all. They are always playing/speaking to the ultimate truth/good, and never being themselves. You see, they do not have the ticks and mannerisms of real live conversations, i.e., the dialogue sucks.I could keep going but I think that's enough - 2 1/2, 3 stars at most.",7,1,3,4 October 2010
The Fifth Element," The Fifth Element is one great movie!
","You know, this movie is really good, but all those scenes that have President Big Deebo really take away from the film. I only mention that because literally every other moment of Fifth Element is great, but those scenes with the President and all the soldiers are just plain bad. They're really the only flaw of the movie. Ian Holm and Gary Oldman give really awesome performances, and Jovavich, Tucker, and Bruce Willis round out the very nice cast. This is almost a comedy as much as it is sci-fi action; it's just plain entertaining. It's a very appreciated and above par blockbuster, not the typical garbage. This is on the short list of favorite sci-fi movies ever for me. It's a very fun movie. I give Fifth Element an 8 only because it does not take itself too serious (and those Big Deebo scenes).",8,0,4,1 September 2010
Batman Returns," Catwoman Returns
","I believe the word you're looking for is 'Ahhhhh!'.All good things considered, Batman Returns is unbelievably awesome. Tim Burton created a despairingly epic world in Gotham City, and I cannot say enough how perfectly wonderful the movie Batman Returns is! It's great all in an atmospheric nostalgic kinda way. The Batman script has been ripped to pieces in a way through way of the imaginative interrupted mind of Tim Burton, and it all works well and it's all to be well loved. Thank you, Mr. Burton. Batman Returns is one of my favorite movies, of all movies considered. I greatly prefer your Batman as best of all!Batman Returns is a visual and audio masterpiece, basically! It's so well-done, to only say the least about it. The actors are excellent, and the overall indulgent satisfaction level of Batman Returns is immeasurable. I loooove it. Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito...the stars are terrifically cast...look, here is the one thing about Batman Returns that you might have not noticed when watching it, sort of Batman Returns' sexy little secret.....Catwoman is actually the main star, and not Batman! Can you believe it? Catwoman is the lead character. What an unforeseen, yet I say, lovely change of fortunate circumstance for us, the viewers, and I do agree that it may be a bit misleading and ultimately untrue to the original desired upon essence of even making a Batman movie to begin with, whereas Batman is the main star, obviously, but who's complaining? I'm not! Michelle Pfeiffer is incredible! Michelle makes this movie. She is just incredible as Catwoman in Batman Returns. Pfeiffer's purr-fect for the part. I love Michelle's black leather catsuit. This movie is so clearly wholly surrounded around Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, Selina Kyle, while Michael Keaton the co-star is again excellent as Batman, Bruce Wayne. I am here to tell you this, the one particular scene where Catwoman is back handspringing out of the corner Gotham shop that she's set to explode, when she first meets Batman and Penguin in the street where she stops, standing in front of them breathing heavily, looks at the two and in feign disgust she simply utters... Meow ...and the building blows suddenly and then she's off! Oh my God, I love that moment, like, understand, I deeply loooooove that moment. I do. I deeply love that moment as deeply as I love Michelle Pfeiffer, and like, I loooooove Michelle Pfeiffer, deeply. All of my deepest desires are perfectly summed up in that one deep beautiful moment from Catwoman Returns, I mean, Batman Returns. It's really, really deeeeeep.",8,0,1,3 February 2014
Finding Nemo," ~~^~/\~FiNdiNg~neMo~\__/~j~~
","Finding Nemo is 1 of the very best computer-animated films ever! Albert Brooks is clowning as Marlin the Clownfish. Ellen Degeneres is unforgettable as Dory the Blue Tang Fish. Albert & Ellen have gifted animated voices. The Finding Nemo story is near perfect, the writing is near brilliant, and all the great sea characters' adventures are classic family fun. The turtles are the best. Finding Nemo is hilarious! Nemo is lost away from home while his Dad is searching far across the Great Sea to find Nemo at all costs. Finding Nemo is 1 of my go- to family friendly films that's great for kids & perfect for adults. Go see Finding Nemo!",9,0,1,14 March 2015
Blade," Blade Is The Daywalker
","Blade is a slice 'em and dice 'em and leave 'em for dust, super action fantasy adventure, that's rated R and pretty bloody. It's a Marvel adaptation of one of the lesser known comic book heroes, Blade, that has thus went on to become a successful movie franchise. One of the original and one of the greater comic book films made, you'd have to go all the way back to 1998 to remember this comic classic, Blade, have we all forgotten about this movie? Blade is fairly awesome! I don't hear about too much worthy praise for Blade but in time Blade will surely be remembered and appreciated for the generally awesome movie that it is.Played bestially by Wesley Snipes, Blade is a legendary vampire hunter who is a half-breed, half-man half-vampire, only one of his kind, making him The Daywalker, giving him all the strengths of the vampire but with none of their weaknesses. In his fight against evil, Blade's equipped with an extensive arsenal of blades and guns and special gadgets to stay alive with, and he's a master of the martial arts with superhuman strength and capabilities. Blade's one man army weapon specialist, Whistler, makes all kinds of useful toys for Blade. Deacon Frost is the street smart, book smart, driven bloodthirsty lead villain vampire obsessed with unleashing the Blood God, La Magra. Blade ends up taking a liking to a human who is about to turn, Karen, unless they can find a cure. N'Bushe Wright appears in one of her best roles. She's incredible as Karen. N'Bushe Wright is physically impressive alongside Wesley Snipes. Kris Kristofferson is really awesome in Blade. Kristofferson gives a really moving performance. It's one of his better roles. Stephen Dorff can be found in one of his top roles. Dorff is believable as Deacon Frost and very good.Blade's razor-sharp from end to end, nicely pieced together with spectacular fight scenes, bass-pounding techno, excellent storyboard, intense action and star-powered acting from Wesley Snipes, Wright, Kristofferson, and Dorff. If you're a fan of this type of a movie and you haven't seen it yet, GO WATCH IT, and HURRY! Blades's a really cool flick!",7,0,1,17 December 2013
Just Go with It," Just Go With It, Dude, Whatever
","Welcome, everyone, to Final Jeopardy! Let's check the category - Unforgettable Sandman. Okay, great dude. And the answer is...this is the plot for 2011's Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston hit romantic-comedy, Just Go With It. Dooo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Okay now put down your magic computer screen markers and let's see your answers, contestant number 1. 'Where is or what is, uh, like a plastic surgeon wants to meet a girl or take his girlfriend on a vacation so he creates up a fake family with two kids and a wife but he and the wife are actually divorced and they used to be married or maybe not. I don't know, dude. You tell me Alex!' Oh, I'm sorry, the correct answer is what is nobody knows. Nobody knows. We also would have accepted nobody cares and I don't know, I've never seen it. And how much did u wager? 2 hours on a Saturday? You LOOOSSSSE!Just kidding. Whatever. I really love this movie. Just Go With It is 1 of my favorite comedies. It is! I love it! Just Go With It is the most extraordinary genius comedic script released in the last 200 years. Charlie Chaplin, eat your heart out! Just kidding, dude. The plot line of Just Go With It is so poignant, identifiable and established that I think that I might pass out right now just talking about it. It's 40 minutes later, I did pass out, I'm drooling on my keyboard, I feel hungry for some crackerjacks, and I think maybe I've come to my senses a bit. Maybe this isn't the best comedy script since 1815, I don't know, dude. Who am I to judge? But I do know one thing...the Sandman has done it again! Way to go, dude! You goofy and adorable dude, you. This movie is great with a lowercase g. Get it? Whatever. Who's hotter? - Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Aniston or Brooklyn Decker? Dooo doo doo doo doo. Jennifer Aniston, I say. But I'm only saying that to make Nicole jealous. It's actually Brooklyn Decker...whatever, dude. Brooklyn has way less baggage than the other two. Brooklyn Decker is really comfortable on screen with these big stars and she does a really good job for a super sexy SI swimsuit cover model. A pair of her best credentials are most directly visible when Brooklyn is coming out of the sunny Hawaiian ocean in that humongous yellow bikini in slow-mo. Is that the right size, Brooklyn? She would probably know better than I, but I would think you would sink like a stone wearing sail flaps like that when swimming. I don't know, dude, whatever. Jennifer Aniston looks real sexy in this movie, and I think right now I'm trying to hide the fact that I am madly in love with Jennifer, dude. I love you, Jennifer Aniston. Whatever. Jennifer looks incredible with a lowercase i when she gets undressed to go swimming in that beautiful lagoon in that little pink bikini. How very flattering. What a hot ass. I mean, Jennifer...okay, I mean Jennifer's ass. She always is good for a chubby in that bikini scene. It's magical. Jennifer looks so hot in that bikini, I'm drooling on my keyboard once again. She definitely has a way hotter body than Brooklyn. That two-piece fits you well, Jenn. Is this in slow-mo or not? Yes. Nicole Kidman is really funny as Devlin and she's really funny in real life too. Lol! Can I just say, Nicole is beautiful. There's your competition, Jenn. Nicole nearly steals the show and she wins audiences over when she flashes her booty for a brief second in the epic Hawaiian coconut dance-off. What a fine slow-mo moment that is.These 3 girls are so hot, Adam Sandler can just show up to the set, make some stuff up on the spot, and just go with it. Is that what happened? I hope so. The sexy nature of Just Go With It is great, and it all could have been even sexier with longer lasting stills on Jenn, Brooklyn and Nicole when they are being sexy in their scenes, those moments are a bit too fleeting, and way more sex appeal from the Sandman, for the ladies of course, and the fellas as well of course, and maybe even a plot, too! This plot is so random and whatever that it actually works out because the characters seem way more natural like their not even in a movie thanks to the performances from these dudes. That's a good thing! I do love this romantic-comedy, it's hilarious. I laughed out loud so many times, or zero times, I don't know, dude. I'm not a laugh counter. Who is? Just kidding, dude, whatever. But what I do know is Just Go With It is a really funny, and good comedy. It's really funny. Whatever. I have no more to say, except I love you, Sandman, and Jennifer Aniston. Dude.",5,0,0,3 February 2015
Deadpool 2," Mutants at Play - Deadpool 2
","Warning: Be Advised Deadpool 2 is really sweet!#Deadpool - super badass, super cool, super sweet, super beloved, super well played by Ryan! Reynolds is the epitome of Deadpool, as a matter of fact, he is Deadpool. Just like Michael Keaton is Batman. And Val Kilmer. Deadpool is the best superhero ever I love everything about him. He regenerates. He'd throw down in fisticuffs in a heartbeat to save your back. And he's deadly accurate, funny, and highly skilled with weapons as well as pretty dang quick! I love how he's good at heart yet lethal and now apart of the X-Force super mutant team forever! Deadpool is up there with the best, most powerful mutants always has been always will be! Kinda like Wolverine! They both heal and fight in close quarters combat with blades and knives and are always getting the living hell beat out of them! But Deadpool's way cooler than Wolverine is! Logan's a lameoid assclown! There I said it. I wouldn't say this to Wolverine's face but I don't care for his beard much. I love Deadpool.#Domino - One of the coolest, most badass, strongest, most likeable mutants in all the X-Men universe and extended Marvel world, always has been always will be. I love Domino! Domino's excellent in D2! She sure knows how to stay out of harm's way! Zazie Beetz is the best Domino ever! Well, considering she's the only Domino ever! She really is so cool! I love Zazie Beetz! Domino, turns out, is more than just lucky, the girl's got mad skills!#Colossus - Always metal, all the time, he's never not metal, I love it. I love metal Colossus. I wish always metal all the time Colossus would show up in every X-Men movie plus Marvel movie too considering he loves his metal form so much he just never transforms back into human form so who cares! Who needs to pay actors just hire metal Colossus he'll do it, he's so strong!#Cable - Real good, real strong, real nice though not very true to the original Cable who's a weapon specialist and super marksman, like Deadpool, with an ability to connect to and use advanced technology with his cybernetic arm plus he's very durable. Cable is way stronger than Deadpool is really but whatever. He DOES travel through time and Josh Brolin is NOT the worst Cable. I love Josh Brolin! Cable's awesome in this movie!#Negasonic Teenage Warhead - Most underrated mutant ever! She generates an atomic blast ray that she can project or something like that plus she can do like way more! I love Teenage Warhead! I love Brianna Hildebrand!#Firefist - Not cool, never heard of him. He shoots fireballs from his fists! Good villain though he's got a mad temper!#Juggernaut - Spoiler, Juggernaut's in D2, I don't know if Juggernaut can rip Deadpool in half or not he is really strong and everything but his main power's like building momentum and bull rushing people charging through walls and being indestructible and stuff and even though he couldn't rip Deadpool in half like that like Deadpool's a marshmallow or cotton or whatever I still love it! This is the Juggernaut done right! Unlike Last Stand!#Bedlem - Nice, he can make people feel nauseous! I love Terry Crews!#Zeitgeist - Cool, that's Pennywise. From It! He spits poison.#The Vanisher - Easily Brad Pitt's most relevant performance edging out Seven, Seven Years in Tibet, Twelve Monkeys, Ocean's Thirteen and Ocean's Eleven, whoa, if you don't include Fight Club, all of Brad Pitt's best movies have numbers in them! Astonishing!#Shatterstar - The best!The action in Deadpool 2 is great I love it! Conceptually speaking, Ryan Reynolds has the Midas touch. I want more X-Force!",6,0,1,26 March 2019
X-Men," X-Men - a real COMICBOOK feat
","X-Men is an spectacular cinematic achievement! The way comic book movies were meant to be seen, with respect and a surrendering belief to the comic book world. A belief is natural for real fans of the comic universe. X-Men is a realistic take on comic book heroes. The story of the X-Men is ultimately one of the best reasons to even film a movie in the first place of any kind. X-Men addresses major relevant societal issues entirely through, just as the original comics, in a simple to understand and positive way. Bryan Singer and company did wonderful work to create X-Men the movie. The actors and actresses are X-cellent! Hugh Jackman is the Wolverine, and nobody, that is, nobody could have done better. Hugh is feral and warmhearted as Logan. Patrick Stewart epitomizes Charles Xavier, Professor X. Patrick Stewart the mastermind. Ian McKellan is too, ideal as Magneto displaying a real understanding and connection to the character. Getting Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan for these roles is a perfect world come true. Halle Berry does a great job of acting support from the side and not becoming too much of the focal point in her portrayal as Storm. If I'm not noticing Halle then the movie really holds up, believe me. Anna Paquin is such a naturally very gifted actress and she fits the role of Rogue beautifully. Famke Janssen really personifies X-Men Jean Grey acting as one of the noticeably more interesting characters of the viewing. Rebecca Romijn is really the perfect Mystique and she certainly has the perfect body for Mystique. And if anybody ever needed an actor to play Cyclops, we could only hope James Mardsen was available. Marsden is very solid, very good. The other two stars, Ray Park and Tyler Mane, are as good as any playing as Toad and Sabretooth. X-Men has a smartly shown story developing sharply from scene to scene. Smart action with very good special effects. A great visual experience. It has an impressive score. The mutants abilities and their mutant powers are truly awesome. Thank you, Brian Synger and company. Thanks to the great casting of the cast and to the cast themselves. And, of course, a true special thanks to Stan Lee the creator. I love the X-Men. It is one of my most interesting and favorite things to think about and imagine and adore, that is, I love the X-Meeeen! X-Men is great and very appreciated by the fans. X2, the sequel, is a really special film and even better than the first, much better.",7,0,0,10 July 2014
The Terminator," Mankind vs. Machines
","James Cameron's The Terminator is an excellent of a start to an epic sci-fi saga. The Terminator is Cameron's first major film, and he couldn't of done any better. The Terminator is an all-around better sci-fi action film equipped with great direction, brilliant storytelling, and high caliber acting from Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and, of course, Arnold. Arnold. Arnold. That's right, use your Austrian accent. Arnold. I love, Arnold. Arnold, Schwarzenegger was the strongest selection on planet Earth to become the Terminator. Arnold is the Terminator. The Terminator launches Schwarzenegger's career into unprecedented superstardom. The Terminator is Schwarzenegger's most iconic role. 'I'll be back.' Linda Hamilton, too, is literally the best woman in the world to be Sarah Conner. She was born to play Sarah, and she has earned it. Michael Biehn has the star strength of a soldier. Biehn's tough to replace as Kyle Reese, the man sent back in time 50 years from the future on a succeed at all costs mission to protect Sarah Connor, the mother of her unborn child, John Connor, who is the leader of the human resistance against the machines far into the future, and yep, you guessed it, the machines sent back Arnold the Terminator to Sarah Connor's time to hunt her and kill her. The Terminator has a timeless battle of resourceful human soldier, Kyle Reese, vs. unstoppable killing machine, the Terminator. The Terminator has an innovative and groundbreaking story for its time. The Terminator is high conceptual cinema that's powerfully dramatic and happens to be a bit scary at times. Bill Paxton plays his role for the time making for more classic Cameron. One thing that really makes the Terminator special, that you wouldn't have known at the time, is that its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is one of the all-time 50 best movies, and easily in the conversation of being the best sci-fi fantasy adventure, along with a few other Cameron greats, like Avatar, Aliens and The Abyss. T2 improves in all the right areas where T1 is minorly lacking. The Terminator very much feels like one extended and incomplete preview, yet, outstanding outing of the soon to be conceived and released, T2. I love The Terminator story, and I'm a big fan of all of the Terminator movies, especially T2. Arnold. 'I'll be back.'",8,0,0,17 January 2014

Scary Movie 2," Scary Movie 2 - Welcome to Hell House (NOT as scary as the original though just as good!)
","I love Scary Movie 2! The Wayanses have did it again! Have they ever done it together like this before ever? Yes! This scary movie sequel to the original Scary Movie is not quite as scary as the 1st 1 is nor is it nearly as good though it is just as funny plus it's even way more sexy than the 1st 1 is! The 1st 2 Scary Movies do stand out as being better from the rest of the bunch (than parts 3, 4, & 5) as I love them all but I actually kinda prefer Scary Movie 2 as barely the best of the series and my personal favorite of the Scary Movies over the 1st 1 even though the beginning plus the exit of it are total cop outs like they wrote everything at the Hell House then ran out of material at the last second!

I do love Veronica Cartwright from Alien! (& her wonderful singing voice!) And I love Natasha Lyonne from the American Pies! (so!) Scary Movie 2 has a great ensemble comedy cast! Scary Movie 2 spoofs many recent movies of the time and it also pays tribute to some of the much older classic ones from just about any decade from the past really! I love The Exorcist! (the jolly & crappy & pukey & painful to watch over the top intro, outside of Veronica's lovely singing at the beginning of course!) I love The Amityville Horror!

Closer," OMG Natalie's bum is so nice in Closer!
","I love Julia Roberts. Her makeout moment with Jude is beautiful. Closer's an honest and miserable look at love with excellent back and forth dialogue albeit a little too much of it. Nobody cares about these character's perverse relationships as much as we care about glaring at all-time beautiful Natalie's butt in a thong as a stripper, and there's nothing perverse about that! Closer's outstanding, brilliant, a classic romance really, but I personally feel it's hated on because all-time sexy Natalie and all-time sexy Julia and sexy Clive and sexy Jude and their uber-sexiness should have been put on way more display in this slow messy film and the picture's focus on the exhaustive personal dynamics should have taken a major back seat to Natalie's major back seat and to the stars' personal performances but I still personally really love it it's 1 of my personal favorite love stories (IMPeronalO). So personal. Natalie Portman is so raging hot in Closer OMGod I love her! I seriously do. Natalie has the best ass, and laugh. Portman parading around in her pretty purple little petite panties and pink wig is pure f'ing paradise and maybe the most pleasurable and perfectly pleasing hot nude scene/non-nude scene I've ever seen, thanks to Natalie and her exquisite body. It's also one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a film. Julia's the hottest, sexiest, beautifulest actress ever and Natalie's like top 10, uugggh. Natalie's star's still rising though O M G I love Natalie and Julia; their 2 of the hottest actresses/women ever! Roberts is the hottest girl ever, she really is, but Portman is a new generation girl and new generation girls are way hotter than old generation girls, aw, oh my God, I love Natalie Portman.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," What a failure for George Lucas...
","I hold Star Wars in such high esteem that I'm going to rip this movie way more than it deserves; it's relative to the other films. This is the only bad entry of the 6 films. It's so bad. The opening scene where the decoy Padme gets her ship blown up is done in such horrible fashion. It's presented horribly. There are no interesting cuts or details or anything. The scene didn't capture me at all, just lame. Then some Jedis talk some things out, and Anakin is put in charge of personally guarding and protecting Padme, (ok, great...this could lead to some great scenes) but it turns into a complete love story, and a lame love story at that, believe me. No good lines or exchanges between Padme and Anakin. Very Weak. Obi-Wan is given the task of investigating this Clone Army, and this results in the best part of the movie. Kenobi fights Jango Fett, a very cool scene, and then proceeds to follow his ship which is another very cool scene. It leads to Kenobi getting captured by Count Dooku, so Anakin and Padme have to come rescue him. Just when you think it might be finally picking up and getting good, it turns into the animated series Attack of the Clones and Skywalker ends up in a factory fighting a bunch of alien-bugs while having to use his Jedi prowess to avoid getting smashed in the assembly line. So bad. What potential for a scene, Anakin has to go save Kenobi from Dooku, and this is where Lucas takes it. Was he making this movie for 7 year olds? It goes on as they're all imprisoned and set to be eaten by a bunch of uncreative, lame creatures. So bad. Then the epic final battle breaks out with all the Jedis. Sounds great...not really. Most of the time they're fighting the same ol' droid with little variety, and really all you see is Jedis deflecting laser beams. Mace Windu does actually shine during this battle. His scenes are really good, but it's the only good part of the entire 'epic' battle. So Yoda swoops in to whoop some tail, wait, no, he's just there to give them a ride. OK. Whatever. Off to chase Dooku now, which is a decent scene, Yoda's really good at giving orders. Skywalker and Kenobi eventually catch Dooku and we are given a very nice lightsaber duel. Dooku is too strong, but then Yoda shows up. We get to see Master Yoda fight. Yes! The duel is way too short, but good, up until the end. The way Dooku escapes is so ridiculous, forcing Yoda to use the force to prevent the massive pillar from crushing Anakin and Obi-Wan's bodies. Narrow minded and uncreative. Why didn't Yoda force push their bodies out of the way, then go whoop Dooku some more? Why didn't Anakin or Obi-Wan just move? There were like 100 things wrong with that moment. The ending, just like nearly all the other scenes, was a letdown. There could have been so much more dynamic in all of the action scenes. The overall writing is just weak, and you know what, the set designs are weak too. You think that's one thing Lucas wouldn't mess up (the first 3 were so good in this area) but the sets lack proper detail. What a failure of a movie. Compared to the rest of the saga, this movie is a 3 outta 10, but I guess it deserves a 6.",6,0,2,25 July 2010

Fargo," Fargo's in a class of its own.
","Fargo is truly awesome. It's like a light-hearted, whimsical, deeply dark and disturbing comedy-drama, or something like that. It's in a class all of its own is what I mean. There is no movie that's like it. It's really amusing and disturbing at the same time. And it's completely fascinating. And it's absolute quality film making. The Coen Brothers really put their touch on the film. I feel William H. Macy is the best part of this movie. His character is genius. And Macy really gave an awesome performance. McDormand and the 2 thugs are a close second. The cast really shines. Fargo is a true gem. It has depth, details, all the good movie making qualities you need. I feel this is one of the most powerful movies ever made. You almost have to be in the right mood to watch Fargo, because it is so dark, but if you are, it will be one of the best movies you'll ever see. I think this is a bonified, consensus classic that will stand any test of time. Fargo is so precious, just because it's so completely different from any other film. Words are unable to describe, just go watch it for yourself! Worthy of a perfect score, 10 of 10.",10,0,3,13 July 2010
Léon: The Professional," Awesome movie, but too overrated on IMDb Top250.
","I went to look up 'The Professional' thinking I was looking up one of the most underrated, cultural classic films ever. Then I saw the rating - 8.6. What... Now I realize that 'The Professional' is the most overrated movie on this entire Top250 list. An 8.6! That is absurd! Do not get me wrong, this movie is so great. Gary Oldman is my favorite actor. This is maybe his best performance. All of his scenes are fantastic. It is all of the scenes without Gary Oldman that I have a problem with. What is so 8.6 great about the give and take between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman's characters, which essentially dominates the film. Those scenes are sort of boring. The story is too over the top too, and the things that happen and the things that the characters do seem too unbelievable. The action is not all that believable either, although it is very well done. As great as Gary Oldman's character is in this movie, he does not elevate it enough to be listed as a top 30 movie of all-time. I am laughing at that rating. This flick should be in that 7.9 to 8.2 realm, not 8.6! I would truly give this movie an 8 out of 10 rating, it was an awesome action-drama, but I got to give it a flat 1 out of 10, just because so many people drastically overrate this film.According to the Top250, 'The Professional' is better than 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'Aliens', 'The Departed', 'L.A. Confidential', 'American Beauty', 'Unforgiven', 'Die Hard', 'Heat', 'Fargo', 'The Lion King', 'The Sting', 'Raging Bull' and about 50 other movies it shouldn't be in front of. Ch'ya!

Justice League," What a sad inJustice League.
","(worst opening scene ((ultrabad)) Batman vs. a bug?????)O M G it's Gal. Wonder Woman is awesome in this & she's the strongest Justice League Member!! Gal Gadot is seriously badass I'm really not even really kidding at all.I love Aquaman played by Lisa's man Jason but I think Aquaman should be in the water and stuff.Ben Affleck is not the worst Batman (Cloontang is) but he's DEFINITELY playing the most terribly written Bruce Wayne/Batman/Whoever wrote this sux...incredibly. (what a great, UNDERUSED cast/install drama please)Cyborg's an awesome, sweet character but his digital cyborg face & body make me want to go watch the animated Justice League movies.Wolfenstein is the worst character in the history of characters & that includes protagonists & antagonists (not just villains).Flash is sweet. I love this movie it's awesome the only good scene is when they wake Superman up and he fights the Justice League (with no shirt on) but SuperMAN is a SuperMAN, if his name was SuperGod then whoever wrote this wouldn't be so terribly sucky. Gal Gadot is a great actress. (I'm really not even really kidding at all really she really is!) Amy & Diane are not as good as actresses as Gal. That is a fact. Benny can act too.I LOVE gaL gaDOT & The Justice League NEEDS A GOOD VILLAIN!",5,1,5,18 July 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," This movie sucks and the dudes who made it are stupid.
","The Matrix is one of the best movies ever. A true 4-star classic. The Matrix Reloaded is a far, far, far step down, but still an entertaining movie. The Matrix Revolutions is the trashiest joke of a movie ever produced. What happened? Seriously? These Brothers must have gotten really lucky to think up the first Matrix. I dunno how they did it. They are obviously not smart. Seriously, what happened? Why is this movie so bad compared to the first one? Those Brothers are idiots. Really. They have to be. Why does the first Matrix seem so pure, and the 2 sequels feel like scattered, random, wastes of nothingnesses? If those Brothers were smart, they would have never released such bad sequels. So I rest my case, the Wa cow ski Brothers are stupid. They just got really lucky to think up the Matrix. They showed their true grit in Revolutions. Every scene that takes place in Zion is bad. I am not lying. Every single scene that takes place in Zion is bad. It's the truth. So why did Neo give his life? To save....who? Morpheus has completely gone astray as a character, he seems senile and useless. Why didn't they fight more inside the matrix? Seriously. How hard is that? Show some cool fight scenes with bullet dodging and the works...but nothing. This movie is so bad on so many levels its a waste to even take time to explain it. A complete waste. This movie doesn't even exist. Let's all forget it ever happened. The Matrix - 90/100 The Matrix 2 - 73/100 (still quality) The Matrix 3 - 00/100",1,0,1,2 August 2010
Grease," Grease - The Best Musical Ever!
","THE BEST MUSICAL EVER!I love Grease. It's my favorite movie ever when I need to groove out. All the songs are purely outstanding. The special tunes are 'Summer Nights', 'Grease Lightning', 'You're the One That I Want', and 'Hopelessly Devoted to You' which might be the best song sung by the stars of the bunch.Olivia Newton-John is a superstar; she's special and she starring in Grease makes Grease special. Olivia is an absolute dreambot. John Travolta has special talents; John is such a great dancer and he makes Grease special too.The songs are amazing in Grease creating the best sing along moments ever, and the movie itself is very watchable and such fun. I LOOVVEEE GRRREEEEEAASSEE! I give it a true 10 out of 10 for it is a masterpiece. The national dance off is the best part with Sandy and Danny, unless the end is.GREASE ROCKS! FOREVER!",10,0,0,8 October 2016
The Color of Money," Fast Eddie and The Color of Money
","The Color of Money ain't about pool. The Color of Money isn't about young Vincent, or his girlfriend, Carmen. And believe it or not, The Color of Money isn't even about money. The Color of Money is about Paul Newman's character, Fast Eddie Felson, and his salvation to place meaning with significance to his trying lonely life as a pool hustler. Viewers lost in the glam of hustling pool or the action of 9-ball are missing out seeing the real beauty of this film of the story told. The story and life of Fast Eddie Felson that is. And credit to Paul Newman to go along with the brilliant character of course. Newman gives his grade A+ performance, one of the best I've ever seen, from Newman, or from anybody that is. Paul Newman is beautiful. The Color of Money is one truly exceptional character piece. The Color of Money, for my money, is better than The Hustler. It's an incredible sequel. It's an incredible feature. It's one of my more loved movies, mostly for Paul Newman's performance, but also very much for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Tom Cruise as well. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the main co-star here, and Tom Cruise takes on third role. I love the beautiful Mary Elizabeth. She's so good. She has such true acting abilities, which is rarer to find in Hollywood than one might think. Tom Cruise is great as Vincent, one of his more well acted roles to go along with Jerry Maguire and Rain Man, which is his best. Tom Cruise has some true acting talent too, just not like Newman or Mastrantonio, only because that they are two of the very best. Cruise has more star quality though. Don't get me wrong. The kid can act. I just love Tom Cruise. The best of the magic of The Color of Money happens between Newman and Mastrantonio as they quietly share a magnetic connection. The magnificent Martin Scorsese is a master of his trade, maybe the best in the business, and The Color of Money is one other misperceived, under-appreciated Scorsese classic, to go along with Casino and Gangs of New York, as well as but to a smaller scale, Shutter Island, The Aviator, Cape Fear, Bringing Out the Dead, and Mean Streets. The Color of Money is a 9 out of 10 ranking, an outstanding mark, nothing less. I hope I spelled Mary Elizabeth's last name right every time, Mastrantonio. It would be too entirely challenging to revise such a mishap. But I know that I did. Mastrantonio, God, that's a terrific name.",9,4,4,1 January 2014
Cold Mountain," It Gets Very Cold High Up On Cold Mountain
","Cold Mountain starts off as some sweeping, dramatic love story but soon settles into an unbecoming, whimsy mess of a movie, in a weird sorta way, but it completely strikes home. The movie begins by exhibiting a mood appropriately disparaging for a Civil War love tale, but it soon creates a strangely merry, airy atmosphere. It's fine or good either way. The plot is just as scattered as the movie is pieced together. There is largely lacking fluidity to the edited story. Although it has good action scenes, they are too ineffectively dark in contrast. More importantly worse, Cold Mountain has hardly any immersion. It detests and rejects you more than it entices and comforts you. I cannot care too much towards Jude Law's character as he makes his journey way back home, as he never ingratiates himself to the audience much in any way, other than being dashingly desirable as the love interest. The love story with Nicole Kidman and her character offers the closest thing to immersion, to getting lost in the story. Nicole Kidman is pure beauty. At this point in her life, Nicole has ascended into super beauty. She is, awe, her most gorgeous self. In a film that lives off its deep cast acting, Nicole in her lead's the best reason for watching, but Cold Mountain is not centered on Kidman's character enough. Cold Mountain is Kidman's movie. I'm certain Nicole Kidman gives the strongest acting performance of the three main stars, her, Zellweger, and Law, yet somehow Kidman was the only one that was not nominated of the three, and Renee even won! Zellweger gives an underwhelming performance, not even one of her best. Zellweger was far too exaggerated, talking and walking like some heehaw slack-jawed yokel, really ridiculous. How she won the Oscar, you tell me. She's just not a good an actress as Nicole is all. Her character, even though it's good in thought, is a big reason as to how the film winds up taking an unpleasant turn to the worse. Cold Mountain has near-great clips, but it's all throughout dressed up too unnatural. It's too divided between pained drama and gleeful amusement. I feel no chilling impact from Cold Mountain. I have to force myself to enjoy it. It's so, pointlessly underachieving. I do enjoy the movie for Kidman and Law's interacting, and that's about it. In retrospect, I was too critical in this review, but Cold Mountain sells itself as such an acclaimed movie and it's really not, so let me say, Cold Mountain is really, really good, very nicely romantically enchanting. There, is that good?",7,0,0,20 July 2013
The Shining," Heeerrrrre's a review for The Shining!
","Off the bat, I have to say that this is the scariest movie I've ever seen. It's entirely creepy. A psychological horror. It is scary the whole way through. The Shining is even more chilling than the icy Colorado setting it takes place in. It is the only movie that I can say has truly lingered with me when I think about what the scariest movies are. Second off, The Shining doesn't just earn a 10 because it's so very scary. This is a cinematic masterpiece. A horror masterpiece. Thank you, Stanley Kubrick. The Shining is timeless. Every single scene is crafted exquisitely. The set of the Overlook Hotel is luxurious. Kubrick's direction is immaculate. Stanley's camera throughout tells one wicked tale from frame to frame, as it's always lurking and ever present, overlooking the characters themselves as if it's the Overlook Hotel watching them. What some people describe is 'boring', and 'slow', is actually setting the tone beautifully for the tensest scenes. The Shining's not slow. That's why it's so great. The Shining is a movie that I just love. It's so awesome. I do have a hard time watching it over and over again because it scares the living bejeebies out of me, but whenever I do watch it, I fall right back into it and it is so good. Jack Nicholson as Jack is incredible in one of the very best and most referred to roles in all of cinematic history. Shelley Duvall as Jack's wife, Wendy Torrance, is just as exceptional. This is Stephen King's best on screen adaptation of one of his novels. Kubrick's ending is superior to King's. The Shining is insanely scary. I sure would not like to be trapped inside of that particular hotel with this guy! Heeeerrrrre's Johnny!",10,2,4,8 January 2014
Salt," Tasty as can be thanks to Angelina Jolie - Salt
","Salt is the ultimate showcase of the world's greatest all-time female lead action star. Sorry Kate Beckinsale from Underworld. Sorry Milla Jovavich from Resident Evil. Sorry Sigourney Weaver from Alien. Sorry Jennifer Lawrence from Hunger Games. Sorry you too Shailene Woodley from the Divergent series. Sorry Zoe Saldana from Columbia and the Avatars. Sorry Uma Thurman from the Kill Bills. Sorry Linda Hamilton from the Terminators. Sorry Daisy Ridley from Star Wars. And you too Charlize Theron from Mad Max and Atomic Blonde. Sorry. Close but no cigarette. Angelina Jolie is the best and also the hottest female action star ever. Angelina's sensational in Salt! I adore blonde-haired Angelina in this thrilling and very SEXY pure action flick from 2010, sexy thanks to Angelina just the hottest woman ever no big deal. Salt is very delicious and quite addicting through stretches though it left a tad of a dry taste in my mouth leaving me very thirsty for more Angelina, similar to the effects of actual sodium.",6,4,5,20 April 2019
We're the Millers," We're the Millers. Hi, Jennifer Aniston!
","We're the Millers is a comedy movie starring various actors playing various parts with a story and set design! Jennifer Aniston is miraculous! I say Jennifer looks as hot as she can be in this movie. Close to it. Hi, Jennifer! (You are so beautiful to me! Can't you seeeeeee!?!) When Aniston is wearing her stripper gear on screen I give We're the Millers two thumbs up! I give it a big thumb up! (Is that a thumb?) Way up! The scene in which the entire movie leads towards, Jennifer Aniston stripping off her tight capris in that random abandoned warehouse, is, AMAAAZZZZZZZING! It's really beautifully done by Aniston. Bravoo! When Jennifer peels down her underwear and flashes her beautiful backside for like .25 seconds, that's the best part of the whole damn movie, by faarrrrrrrr. Thank you, sweet God. Jennifer, you rock! You totally own this movie you are the best reason to watch by far and it's too bad you didn't have way more screen time. You are so beautiful, to me. Jason Seudakis is funny and talented just as not a major leading male in a comedy. Emma Roberts is terrific and funny just kinda didn't have enough good parts in the film, and the actor who plays Kenny, William Paulson, is really good and really funny in the film. We're the Millers is decent...at best. Jennifer Aniston is the saving grace. We're the Millers is so raunchy, so gross, and so tasteless that it is too raunchy, too gross and too tasteless. The comedy itself is hardly even very funny. I love you, Jennifer Anistoon! So much.",5,1,2,28 July 2014
The Patriot," The Patriot
","The Patriot is a fantastic fantasy war saga surely not to be mistaken as an historically accurate account. It takes on the American Revolutionary War and dramatically changes the story for big screen presentation. Mel Gibson's main character, Benjamin Martin, is closely similar to the character Gibson played in Braveheart, and just like Braveheart, The Patriot is a fictional depiction of a past war, a great war fantasy.The Patriot is a family tragedy in a wartime setting. The film is considerably morbid, and nearly too much so. It has too much startling violence, but the film suggests that this may have been deliberately purposeful. War isn't pretty. The Patriot has limited scope, not completely encompassing the grandeur and majesty it attempts to achieve; it's singularly oriented around its hero's avengeful retaliation.Heath Ledger supplies the strongest support in a role that allows for little maneuverability. Gibson is not quite in that most elite acting class that Ledger is in, or was in, even though Gibson is great as Benjamin Martin, but by Mel's strong measure this was a relatively moderate performance for Gibson, not one of his finest. I'm not sure that it was Mel's failing or if it was that of the written character, but Benjamin Martin shows little life. Jason Isaacs is well-cast and outstanding as Col. William Tavington. Isaacs acts as the main enemy, although I feel The Patriot would have been greater with Cornwallis as the primary antagonist and Tavington as the secondary villain. The Tavington character is too despised to be revered. Tom Wilkinson was excellent as he should of had a more prominent role. Joely Richardson is well-cast and adequate as the sister of Martin's deceased wife; she's simply stunning. Chris Cooper does a stellar job and I enjoy all of the moments that Cooper shows in The Patriot.The Patriot has terrific acting, impressive writing, and specifically superb cinematography. One would be proud to have this movie as apart of any collection; it's a must-own. The Patriot is one of the best Revolutionary War movies, not counting too many. It's all fabricated, and it's all very, very good.",8,1,5,16 June 2013
Flashdance," Jennifer Beals + Irene Cara x the '80s = Flashdance
","(Start 'What A Feeling' now)Man, I really love Jennifer Beals. Jennifer Beals is a classic beauty. Jennifer as Alex in Flashdance is super hot. She is perfect for the part. She's got the look, she's got the attitude and the moves. Jennifer is super sexy and really delivers an all-around awesome performance. Flashdance is an all-time classic. It's a smash cultural hit and it's definitely from the '80s. Jennifer's dance sequences in Flashdance are really beautiful and seriously moving and absolutely unforgettable. I love watching this movie over and over again. It's a classic. Flashdance's 'What A Feeling' by Irene Cara is forever classic.'All aloooone I have criied silent teeaars full oof priiide.

Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia!
","Great musical. I love everything about this movie. 6.4...that's a little low here people. We are talking about Mamma Mia you know. A 7.5 or so would be more like it. An 8.5 in my book. I LOOOOVVVEEEEE this movie! Mamma Mia rocks! Big time! Meryl Streep & Amanda Seyfried together own it. Meryl Streep is always playing such overbearing roles it's very nice to see her act more light-spirited and I think she's better for it. I like the whimsical, freely open Meryl the best, I think. God, I love Meryl Streep. She is one of the best. Amanda Seyfried makes her musical big screen debut and she basically is the hottest girl ever. Whoa. Amanda is a big time star with a bright future. She can act. I'm not gonna talk about how much I love Amanda Seyfried. That would be lame. So in summary, Amanda's really sexy. Meryl is awesome, and really sexy. And Mamma Mia is the greatest musical ever and close to it! And one of my favorites. I have so much more to say about this great musical but I'm spent. What more can I say? Mamma Mia is awesome. When I first saw it I wasn't sure how good it was then it basically blew me away. I love Mamma Mia! I love all the songs. Each song is better than the last and inspires such a contrasting feel. ABBA. ABBA. Wow, I love Amanda Seyfried!",8,0,1,21 June 2015
Meet the Fockers," Meet the Fockers is a Very Nice Comedy. One of My Very Own Favorites!
","I love Meet the Fockers! Love everything about it. It's so funny! More so so very good. Every scene is great. Maybe it's not as funny as Meet the Parents the original. Nor as goooood......But personally, I love Meet the Fockers by far more. And nothing personal against the original. Meet the Fockers has a greater cast is all. Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as Rozalin and Bernie Focker is exactly what this sequel needed. Oh my Gosh, they are so funny. The best! They interact hilariously with Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner as Jack and Dina Byrnes, who are great! I love them! There is a real lovely chemistry happening between Danner, De Niro, Hoffman, and Streisand, and those four stars make this movie. I love Ben Stiller as Greg Focker. He's great. But Stiller takes a backseat to the shenanigans of Greg and Pam's parents. 'Honey, I'm in the mood for a chimichanga. So make a chimichanga!' Bernie and Roz are the funniest! Stiller does a fine job holding his own against such great actors, and Teri Polo does too. Dustin Hoffman is phenomenal. Barbra Streisand stills looks so very crazily attractive. Robert De Niro completely falls into his character for his comedic role as Jack Byrnes giving the character great depth making Jack Byrnes intensely interesting but in such at sometime a little offbeat for a comedy but still I feel mostly appropriately light for a comedy allowing the character to be..........attractive. Speaking of attractive! Blythe Danner!...Oh my God! Simply lovely. Simply beautiful. She is the most gorgeous. Oh, goodness. Barbra, I think I'm getting a little verklempt. Talk amongst yourselves. Here I'll give you a topic. Blythe Danner is the sexiest woman alive. Discuss! I love you, Blythe! Teri Polo returns to her role as Pam and couldn't be sweeter or sincerer. Meet the Fockers is the real best. It has great heart. One of my favorite comedies. One of my favorite movies too! I can watch it a million times and it will always be funny because it never gets old! 'Honey, I'm in the mood for a chimichanga. So make a chimichanga!'",7,0,0,24 December 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," Iron Man should have been in it more. Captain America should have done more. Thanos is like the main star. And the Avengers suck making plans. I'm a DC fan now.
","(All of the Avengers plans involves massive casualties like Dr. Strange foreseeing the only possible future outcome out of 14 million and whatever stupid ass number the stupid ass writers of this thought up is to LET THANOS GET THE INFINITY STONES and kill everybody???? Or half of everybody I mean.... We need new superheroes/new writers in Hollywood/I Love This Movie!)Infinity War is 1 of my favorite movies. I love the 1st Avengers & I really love AoU for some reason but as much as I love this franchise (3rd favorite franchise behind LotR & Star Wars) this was a massive letdown. There's no intuitive story like the 1st 2. There's way too many jokes but Infinity War is hilarious it's just full of jokes that totally whiff like Starlord asking if his grenades are gonna blow off his crotch and Thor calling Rocket a rabbit not once, twice, but three times. Why is Thor such a dick? Why is Gamora such an idiot she runs right out into Thanos' trap and goes straight into his grasps so he can use her to sacrifice her to get the soul stone? Why is Starlord such an assface he punches Thanos right in the face just when their about to get the gauntlet off? Why is Hulk Bruce Banner???????? Why is Iron Man so strung out? Why is Spiderman such a doucheregal? Why is Dr. Strange so cynical? Why isn't Captain America and Black Panther and Black Widow in it more? Why are ALL the side villains computerized a couple of them should of been real persons?? Why are War Machine, Nebula, Falcon, Okoye, Wong, Winter Soldier and Shuri so badass in this movie 'cuz they are? Why aren't Groot and Rocket doing much together? Why is Loki in it? Why are Vision and Scarlet Witch the only Avengers that are acting in a manner that make sense????? 
Why is Thanos so big and in it soooo much???I love when Drax is acting like he's invisible and Mantis is like 'Hi, Drax.' hahaha this movie really is hilarious Drax and Mantis are the best there's just way too many jokes and the action is beast but it's not very plot driven like the first movies were and THE AVENGERS NEVER REALLY ALL GET TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A PLAN AGAINST THANOS. I don't like that. That's really stupid. As much as I love this movie it was a huge letdown, God nobody cares about Thanos he's evil as ish. Just stop him. I care about the Avengers. And DC.",7,0,2,16 August 2018
Django Unchained," >0<>0<>Djangoooooo<>0<>0<>Djangoooooo<>0<>0<>0<>0<
","Django Unchained is killer fun. It's an embellished, original tale of devoted retribution set place in the seldom shown slavery stricken South, with an all too uncommon hero, Django, a freed black slave, who vies against a rarely represented adversary, Calvin Candie, a white southern plantation owner, allowing for a really altogether unconventional flick.Django Unchained is awesome, in one word, in two words, it's Quentin Tarantino. Quentin has done it again with Django. It has radical storytelling and is good-humored with slick action. Tarantino is a visionary with his camera-work. His writing and characters are genius.Django is acted greatly by star, Jamie Foxx. It's nice to see Foxx again put his talents to good use within the Django character as he brings out the best in himself. Waltz is ideal to play Dr. King Schultz, to spew Tarantino's clever speech. Christoph Waltz and Quentin Tarantino are a match made in heaven. Leonardo DiCaprio is truly awesome as Calvin Candie. Leo again proves that, if he hadn't already, that he is amongst the true elite of actors, the dozen or so best actors/actresses to ever act. Calvin Candie is one of the most loathed, or loved, villains of all-time. DiCaprio further strengthens his career. 'Now, WHERE IS MY BEAUTIFUL SISTER!' Kerry Washington is great as Broomhilde even though she doesn't get to show off much. Samuel L. Jackson subsequently owns the show as Stephen. Stephen is the real villain of Django, and Calvin's just the candy.Django Unchained consists all of these A-1 film basics, these masterful movie elements, but they come in only small bursts. The film has a hard edit that is loose at the ends. It's not sharp enough as it shows as an incomplete editing job, missing more refinement. Django Unchained's primary storyline needed a healthier streaming singular focal point while at the same time it needed better supporting story structure as well. The main plot is too secondary unto the greater plot line of slavery, and thus, the film's a little unflattering. The best points of Django Unchained don't have enough proper framework. The splattering kill effects are very good for the movie, but I didn't get enough of it, up until the end when at which point it comes on too heavy. Django Unchained connects to the audience by self-referencing its viewing, and I enjoy it but it's instituted a tad untidily, and it became a little silly when Quentin himself showed up to say hello. The movie could have used more enhancing sound. The whole movie needed detailed polish. Pretty damn good though, with greatness like Quentin, you start at perfect and work your way down, opposed to vice versa.I'm careful not to over blow this in mind of Django Unchained's sensitive setting, but Django Unchained is really so funny. Those two jokers, Django and Dr. Schultz, have numerous humorous moments. Calvin Candie has handfuls of laughable lines. The completely comedic sequences with the KKK and the bags, is very amusing. Don Johnson plays a great Big Daddy and he's hilarious. I really crack up at Big Daddy in all his parts. 'You want I should treat him like white folks? No, that's not what I said.' Jonah Hill is terrible during that scene. Jonah plays stupid really stupid-like.Django Unchained has incredible horse riding scenery, and a great kudos to the horses whom all did stellar jobs acting, not fully realizing that they were acting on film, all around strong performances.Django Unchained has a running time of 165 minutes, and it seems to fly by crazy fast. Chalk it up to drawn out, deeply captivating scene after scene, whereas, not one single second of Django is a bore. There is a scene I feel is considerably worse than any other in the movie. At a very crucial juncture, the oriental ode whilst setting the dinner table, with Hilde walking up the stairs to meet and greet King in his chambers, it was missing something, unless I missed something. I estimate Tarantino was going for an unconventional character presentation, nevertheless, it was ill-placed. In Django, Tarantino uses his credentials to taunt and tease the viewer as to what could possibly be next. The biggest gripe about Django Unchained, is this, the movie has its suave, elegant style for the first 2 and more hours that is leading up to one extraordinary ending, but it all gets scrapped, and the movie flips itself into a mindless, shoot-em-up action flick. That was really unappreciated, and is a major reason the movie didn't score higher.Django Unchained is awfully awesome. Just like Django is 1 in 10,000 exceptional, so is Quentin Tarantino. With the completion and release of Django Unchained, the question is beginning to beg to Tarantino. When, now, are you gonna stop playing around and make again that one serious movie, that Pulp Fiction serious movie?",8,0,2,20 July 2013
Kick-Ass," Oh My Gosh, you cannot be serious.
","I have not seen this movie yet. Based off everything I read about it, I expect to see a pretty good movie. BUT, you gave Kick-Ass a 10 out of 10. A 10 out of 10. Are you mental? So this movie is absolute art. So this movie is absolute beauty on film. Please. You do realize that on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 is the highest score you can give, right. That means that you think movies do not get any better than Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass is a masterpiece. Kick-Ass is a powerful, soul-churning experience. Kick-Ass is an epic for the ages. Oh my gosh, I am going to puke. I seriously do not care how good it is, it is nowhere near a 10 out of 10. Get this trash off the Top250 please. I am seriously disgusted that I even took time to write about this movie.If I had to pick one movie to put in a time capsule for future generations, I wouldn't pick Forrest Gump, or Titanic, or Schindler's List, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Nope, none of these sorry films are on par with Kick-Ass! A truly gloriously masterfully powerful epically beautiful film! (ewwgh, excuse me...)",1,3,19,11 August 2010

The ghost hunting scientists speaking their brainy paranormal jargon with their high-tech ghost trapping equipment coming to the rescue to damsels in distress who've seen a ghost, is every nerd's dream, or something close like that. Ghostbusters does a terrific job melding a ghost haunting story into a competent comedy. It does a terrific job in having 'real life' comedic humor; the humor's very authentic feeling. Ghostbusters does a fabulous job at framing and rating the ghost scenes; they're presented very well. The ghost scenes are satisfactorily approving so allowing the lot of the time for great, slapsticky, goofy dialogue. Bill Murray is nothing too short of great as Dr. Peter Venkman. Dan Akroyd is marvelous as Dr. Ray. Harold Ramis is very well as Dr. Egon. Ernie Hudson is well-cast as Winston, just like the rest of the Ghostbusters. 'That's a big twinkie.' Sigourney Weaver makes the movie so great as Dana Barrett, the Gate Keeper, as Weaver's wonderful in one of her most memorable parts. I'm a big nerd for Sigourney. The Key Master, Rick Moranis, is kind of the funniest part. Moranis is really good. I really love his kind, silly character. Gozer is a good enough enemy for Ghostbusters but Gozer is tremendously overshadowed by the doglike creatures, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Slimer, especially Slimer. The old lady spirit reading quietly in the library at the beginning's one of the great movie introduction scenes; it's just really fun, and really scary. Ghostbusters is a great overall family film. It has great music and great sound effects. The Ghostbuster's theme song is forever memorable. Ghostbusters is nothing short of a smash hit, a great film to enjoy with family and friends. I must point out Ghostbusters is not some kiddie movie; it's a great success.'I'm sure there's one big question on everybody's mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that. How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately?'",8,1,1,2 August 2013
Coyote Ugly," Coyote Ugly is Coyote Hot or Coyote Super Hot or Coyote NOT Ugly all thanks to Piper Perabo, Tyra Banks, Maria Bello, Bridget Moynahan and Izabella Miko.
","A small town girl born and raised in South New Jersey by her widower dad, Violet Sanford leaves her pizza-pie-making waitress job behind her hitching a ride to New York City, The Big Apple, to follow her lifelong dream aspiring to become a big time famous star singer and songwriter. I believe in her Piper's sensational. She can wail! Aaaand she's super gorgeous, plus, and most crucially, Piper's heart is so beautiful and so pure. Piper's so hot. I love Piper Perabo. She's so underrated. Dancing on top of the bar is an art form. And nobody does it like Piper.Coyote Ugly is a real classic from the year 2000 it's exceptional material and it is SO underrated imho tyvm. It achieves entertaining absorptive fun storytelling through and through and through. I love Coyote Ugly. Piper's the hottest, by far, or Tyra Banks is, I really can't decide, and Bridget's the next hottest unbelievably even more hotter than the flaming scorching hot Maria Bello only 'cuz Bridget Moynahan's sooooo really hot and Izabella Miko is insane!-ly hot. I love this movie! Lol!! I really do Coyote Ugly is AWESOME!!! It's all-time good. I prefer the unrated version where Piper shows her tits and her butt in a purple thong. I love Coyote Ugly the bar. Where's this place at? I want to go so bad.",7,2,3,6 December 2018
Big Hero 6," Best Animated Movie for Kids since Frozen
","I'm no genius, I'm no science nerd, but Big Hero 6 seems like a big hero hit to me. In a lot of ways Big Hero 6 is better than Frozen. Big Hero 6 is nicer for adults to enjoy, moreso than Frozen, which speaks out to audiences as if it was written by a child, maybe too much so. Big Hero 6 doesn't have that problem. It carries itself in big hero perspective. Spoiler - note to all you future heroes out there, don't go running into burning buildings like a chemical science factory trying to save someone unless it's like your father or your pet cat. That was a little bit crazy. But lucky for Hiro, his brother left him Baymax to look after him! Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred make up the awesome Big Hero 6 team. Big Hero 6 scores a big hero 6. This is one of the better kids' movies and years and many people have let Big Hero 6 fall under their radar. It's a good movie worth watching 'til the end. I love Big Hero 6!",6,1,4,13 September 2015

Dumb and Dumber," The #1 Best Comedy Ever!
","Aren't the jokes and the writing really smart for this movie? Or was that just me? The characters Lloyd and Harry are certainly really stupid. I laugh harder at this movie than any other. Jim Carrey is hilarious the way he's so reassuring that they're on the right track throughout their constant misfortune. Jeff Daniels really excels at playing an idiot too. He was hilarious! A few of the other characters along the way were good, Lauren Holly is a nice touch, the main villain was actually really weak (not the gasman), but that doesn't matter because Carrey and Daniels provide all the laughs needed. Dumb and Dumber goes down as the #1 comedy in movie history. Thank you Farrelly Brothers. Dumb and Dumber is the funniest movie ever, no competition.''We've Landed On The Moon!''",10,1,2,21 June 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill: Vol. 1
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & Kill Bill: Vol. 2; choosing which 1 is best ain't easy. Kill Bill 1 moves along at a slicker pace; Kill Bill 2 has tons more prolonged suspense. The 2 movies are suitably unalike although still equally great. I'll stick to the 1st 1, as I completely understand many would; it's got better action for the most part, but don't sleep on the 2nd 1. Quentin Tarantino joins all his favorite movie genres, kung-fu, samurai, and spaghetti western, in the Kill Bills. Tarantino is the master at creating captivating conversation, delivering clichéd dialogue to a flawless degree. This skill was showcased perfectly in Pulp Fiction. It was done in Inglourious Basterds to a dazzling effect. But the drawn out dialogue in Kill Bill 1, while remaining very entertaining, is oft over-utilized. The talks between Beatrix and Vernita Green a.k.a. Copperhead during their knife fight, the chitchat with Hattori Hanzo before he forges The Bride's steel, and Boss Tanaka questioning O-Ren Ishii's position of power during council are some of the main moments being slowed in accommodation. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is at its best when things are happening at a highly stylized progressive pace. The attentive developing plot, the accompanying narration, the crossover to Anime, the excessively bloody effects, the alarming signature theme when The Bride is zoning in on her target, the quick, slick camera cuts blended with sharp sound and well-placed music in presentation of adrenaline pumping, overly intense action makes Kill Bill really awesome and really badass. The battle between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii and all of her subordinates at the dojo hangout in Tokyo is really insane, and the end stands out from the rest of the movie as being really, really awesome and really, really badass, especially Gogo vs. The Bride. There is no actress better to be The Bride than Uma Thurman. She's heroically merciless. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a superb outing from the entirely too talented Tarantino.",8,2,5,31 May 2013
From Dusk Till Dawn," From Dusk Till Dawn is muy sexy.
",A gun blazing AND a fire blazing John Hawkes sets the tone for From Dusk Till Dawn which delivers the goods AND delivers the bads. It leaves you begging for more. This all entertaining film enters as a one of a kind tense and disturbing thriller then transforms into an all out blood splattering pulp art exit! George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are devilish! Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis are blessed! Salma Hayek is on fire! From Dusk Till Dawn is muy sexy. Juliette is so hot and Salma is too. Most Blu-ray worthy!,6,0,1,26 March 2018
Black Snake Moan," Black Snake Moan is one of the hottest movies ever thanks to freaking Christina Ricci!
","Something special's going on here. Little Christina Ricci is the hottest little girl ever. Everyone hotter than Christina, is taller than her, except for like maybe fine ass Nicki Minaj, but little Christina is probably even hotter than Nicki, and shorter. Christina's in her white pair of panties like the whoooole movie long and I love it and I love her and I want her and I respect her and I want to have sex with her, so bad. OMg i LoVe christina RiCCi! Ricci's perfect for the part! Ricci's boobs and nipples are ideal for her sweet petite figure. I like JT. BSM is a very hot Southern-style home cooked though very relatable fun film. I love Christina Ricci! Christina has one helluva heinie, seriously! God, this movie is so stupid sometimes. The black chain is very metaphorical and all. The best part's when Christina's walking through the field like she is a mule since you can't lay around on the sofa all day because you gotta get your legs strong and Ricci turns around to the camera and shows off her exquisite body then turns back around and shows off her perfect butt then yanks on the chain and walks away in the field with the sky and the trees and the far, far less beautifuller than Christina yellow flowers OMg I want to have sex with Christina so bad. I love you Christina Ricci, I think your name is, you're so gorgeous! I think you have to make the right choices in life. Women are beautiful, and Miss Ricci is a good example of that.

The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight delivers, big time!
","This is a great movie. Christopher Nolan is putting together a very impressive resume, and it appears he's the next great filmmaker. The Dark Knight moves along at a rapid pace and it completely works. You get just enough out of the scenes, then it keeps jumping forward. The writing is excellent. This is the Hollywood blockbuster we deserve. A smart, action-filled, visually stunning, truly awesome flick. I think it's safe to say Heath Ledger owns this movie. Nearly all the best moments come from the Joker. I really think Ledger delivered one of the best performances seen on film. Nolan's Joker was great to begin with, and Ledger made it his own. The character is simply brilliant. And you know who else's character was really smart, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. Dent was great, and he should make Batman 3 every bit as good. Eckhart gave a very strong performance, as did Oldman, Gyllenhaal, Caine, Freeman, and even Bale. The cast is so grade-A. Smart, smart movie making. Thank you, Chris Nolan, for saving the Batman franchise, even more than that, making it greater than ever before. I rate this movie a 9.5 outta 10, one of the best action-adventures ever!",10,3,7,19 August 2010

I looove Alison but I'm scared of what might happen next. Alison Lohman's beautiful. This is one of my favorite modern day horror movies, Drag Me to Hell, and it is a movie and I love watching it over and over again because Alison drags me to heaven not hell. She's a monster star, as scary hot, and as super sweet and talented as they come, and I want to be with her, forever, and I'm awaiting her return, to movies.DMtH is awesome, super creepy, funny in a goofy way and very underappreciated I love it. It's a cult horror classic that will stand the endless test of time because of that wicked ending plus it's patient storytelling and it's so well done plus Alison Lohman shines like a beautiful starlight of my soul. Oh my god I love Alison Lohman as much as any actress ever. I hate Justin Long, just kidding, I L.O.V.E. Alison Lohman, just not kidding, and if you don't love that then you can take your love and shove it, you can stick it where the sun don't shine.

Groundhog Day," Groundhog Day Is Hilarious, Quality Film Making, A Genuine Feel Good Classic, Bill Murray At His Best!
","Punxsutawney Phil driving the stolen truck with Phil is one of the most classic funny scenes I've ever seen. I would say this is Bill Murray's best work, but you've seen What About Bob, haven't you? Yes, you have. Bill's the best, the sweetest, he's really pretty funny. This is Harold Ramis' best screenplay, enough about Bill and Harold, you've seen Andie MacDowell, haven't you? Andie's so gorgeous, so sweet. It'd be pretty nice to spend an eternity with Andie reliving February 2 over and over again in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Not as nice as a lifetime though. Phil Connors wakes up at 6:00 AM to Sonny and Cher 'I Got You Babe' every morning in the same bed and breakfast in the same small town in the same Groundhog Day dream until he learns to love right consequently discovering the real beauty of life thus moving onward to a new day, or Phil has to go from a glass is half empty kind of guy to a glass is half full kind of guy, that about sums it up for me.

Pulp Fiction," A classic. Pulp Fiction.
","This movie is so cool. It is the coolest. No movie's got style like Pulp Fiction. The writing/dialogue is simply genius. Quentin Tarantino raised the bar with this film, actually, he took the bar and threw it through the roof. There certainly was never anything like it before, and there hasn't been anything like it since. It's one of a kind, in a world all by itself. This lion of a movie makes other great films look like little kitties. It's one of the best examples of why I love movies. Pulp fiction is so pure, so smooth, so smart. It's simply one of the greatest movies ever. Tarantino's crown jewel; he'll have a hard time topping this.10 out of 10. Untouchable.",10,1,3,13 August 2010

Great everything.7.4...what nonsense. Thanks haters. I thought there's no way Titanic gets a score lower than 8.5....Wow, was I surprised.How can you be so wrong? Don't you understand the great disservice you do by giving a bad review without knowing what you're talking about? Go write it on a wall.Titanic isn't even in the Top250....how is that possible?Oh, I get it...Titanic is the highest grossing movie of all-time, so that's why you hate it. Haters hate. It's what they do. We understand. We know what's really going on with all you haters.Shouldn't you have to answer a few questions before you are able to submit a review, so to prove that you have some remnant of a functioning brain. You disgrace the filmmakers so bad.It really isn't that hard to make a consensus list of the best movies; well it is when a monkey is allowed to write a review.Here's what I'm saying, if you call Titanic anything other than an absolute masterpiece, you are just wrong. A monkey could see that.Honestly, this might be the greatest romantic film ever. And it can't even slip into the Top250......complete, utter and absolute nonsense.",10,4,9,9 July 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," How stupid.......The Matrix Reloaded is compared to The Matrix
","The Matrix is one of the best movies ever. A true 4-star classic. The Matrix Reloaded is a ridiculously bad sequel......comparably speaking, and it's hard to imagine that the two brothers who wrote The Matrix are the same two brothers who wrote this film. What....in the hell....we're you two brothers thinking? The Wa-cow-ski brothers thought that these lamely intelligent, supposedly high-level philosophical concepts in The Matrix Reloaded were to be worth our time.......they weren't. Worthy as a sequel to The Matrix? What....in the hell....we're you two brothers thinking? Neo can fly and there's a million Agent Smiths.....you have destroyed any possible hope of it being great all with that rubbish right there. Neo being able to fly is really flimsy, because his ability to manipulate the matrix is so.....un....cre...a...tive, and restrictive. If he can fly and stop bullets, can't he do a number of other cool things too? Bend the spoon in different ways? You take the Neo from the first Matrix and make him.....a stupid cartoon character or something. The characters in The Matrix Reloaded compared to characters in The Matrix are God awful. You remember Apoc and Switch from The Matrix.....those two we're truly way better characters than.....any, of The Matrix Reloaded's characters, maybe aside from Neo. Trinity and Morpheous have one thing on their mind, and they do not falter from their course to any variation through the entire movie, if you understand me well. The Merovingian, Lambert Wilson's character, would of been good if someone had told him to stop talking, but yeah, The Merovingian is one of the oldest programs, so it really matters when he talks. He's the enemy! Monica Bellucci's character, Persephone, was actually a great character that has been inserted into a bad movie. Her character really is great, just not in this movie. The ghost twins are good. Jada Pinkett Smith's character, Niobi, was a great character addition, she's just not hardly in the movie, her story was in the video game. Wouldn't it have been nice if Niobi's critical plot role could have been added to the movie, instead of the separate entity, video game.....gosh, that's bad. Niobi would have been such an awesome character. The Oracle is really....lazily used and devised in this sequel. 'You have the sight now, Neo. You are looking at the world without time...good luck, kiddo.' Now, Neo, you go fight 500 Agent Smiths, and I'm a get out a here. Oh my gosh, is Neo gonna dodge bullets any time soon? The fight versus the many Agent Smiths is really great, it's just......stupid. The agents are 'humm, upgrades'.......how stupid. The Architect.....is.........an incomprehensible, reprehensible turd. The Architect's mathematical harmony is infeasible due to that one mathematical anomaly, Neo......how.....perfectly stupid. Zion is boring and bad. The Matrix Reloaded has way too many scenes that take place at Zion. The Zion City is missing so, so much variety, and interest. The decision to have Neo's and Agent Smith's powers spill into the real world, the Zion world....was really....consequently stupid. The Matrix Reloaded is missing so much.......purpose......compared to the first one. The Wa-cow-ski brothers should have made a better......choice......in making this movie. I can see it was their......fate......to make bad sequels. Let's get to the good, please God, let's get to the good. Neo fighting the Frenchman's men in the weaponry lobby on that double staircase which then leads straight into the long, highway chase away from the ghost twins and the agents.......is really, really cool. I love that extended scene. It makes the movie worth watching alone.....for sure. If I'm watching The Matrix Reloaded, 9 times outta 10, I'm watching that fight scene with Neo in the weaponry lobby and that awesome highway chase scene, and then turning it off. But this movie really is good. I'm serious. I love The Matrix Reloaded......it's just quite spectacular how bad it is compared to the first, the pure, The Matrix. The Matrix Reloaded is........'just a game'.",7,0,1,25 July 2013

Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Super Sexy Angelina Jolie meets Super Hot Brad Pitt and a movie's involved.
","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a good star-powered vehicle, an intelligently done mindless action flick with good action and good humor. Its script's intentionally over the top and it makes fun at conventional movie standards in a mildly refreshing and amusing way.Mr. and Mrs. Smith are played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Have you ever heard of these guys? They're big famous stars. Angelina Jolie as Mrs. Smith looks good, like...really good, like....oh my God, you're the hottest woman on the planet looking hotter than ever, really good. And Brad Pitt as Mr. Smith, uh.....the same...except, he's not a woman see he's a man. I think that this movie needed 2 hotter stars to play the leads, whichever planet you can find them on, oh my gosh. Pitt and Angelina Jolie exude other worldly sexiness, goodness. When Jennifer Aniston watches this movie does it infuriate her? She probably doesn't watch it. Pitt was with Aniston when the movie started production yet somehow throughout the course of shooting Pitt ends up with Jolie once filming's finished. How, on Earth, did that happen? Well, you can see Pitt falling for Jolie through the whole movie and that just makes Mr. & Mrs. Smith all the more hotter, and better. But I do not know, I don't even know the half of it. Somehow though Jennifer Aniston lands the consolation prize from the movie, Vince Vaughn. The celebrity dating circle is complete, all is well in the world, uggg, what an utterly stupid review this is.",6,2,4,7 July 2013
Die Hard," Die Hard is way better than good.
","Die Hard isn't the ordinary makeup of your everyday action flick. It has real guts and glory. Die Hard's well-structured all throughout and its foremost purpose is to deliver spectacular action in an innovative, raw approach, flipping the script on action movies forever. N.Y. cop John McClane is not your typical action star. Unlike most prior portrayals of action heroes (Rambo, RoboCop, Dirty Harry) John McClane doesn't stroll around with his machine gun killing off bad guys with some superhuman-like ability almost as if he's hitting targets popping out at a shooting range like the bad guys are trying to get shot. McClane methodically engages in combat using his entire equipped arsenal to emerge the victor, with the imminent threat of danger always lurking just around the bend. McClane manages to keep himself in constant peril, time and time over escaping certain death with an all too resourceful determination. Die Hard is incredible for it, for its realistic display of action. McClane matching against Hans and his band of terrorists is the weight and the overwhelming strength of Die Hard. Bruce Willis explodes onto the scene in the best role of his career. Alan Rickman is especially apt at playing a cold, calculating villain. It does a solid job of introducing the characters John McClane and Holly Gennaro, played by Bonnie Bedelia who is always fine to see, but the beginning seems uncertain of how to move through into the action. The beginning does do a good job though of setting the tone, giving you time to reflect and prepare for what mayhem lies ahead, time to get your popcorn ready. Once the terrorists enter the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper, Die Hard starts to elevate to a high level not only in its entertainment value but in critical regard as well. It contains sharp editing and writing, having a number of good lines. Yippee-ki-yay. At the very end, the long, blonde haired German terrorist, you know, the guy from The Money Pit, he comes back to life badder than ever still well holding his deadly assault weapon as he tries at one last shot at McClane. Luckily, Sgt. Powell is there to save the day allowing Powell his moment of glory. This was an uncharacteristically tacky moment for this mostly masterful film, but Die Hard had already perfectly proved its worth by this point, so a little something for the kids doesn't hurt. Reginald VelJohnson is always acting as a cop, I like him for that. When you're watching Die Hard it will start picking up and it will keep getting better and keep getting better up until the very last scene when at which point your body will then need to be pried out from your seat. Die Hard is one of the all-time very best action movies, and it's all pure action. It's awesome.",10,1,1,5 June 2013
Psycho," All Thanks to Alfred Hitchcock's The Original Psycho (the 1 with Janet Leigh as Marion Crane not Anne Heche)
","1 of the best screenplays ever written by the writer. 1 of the very most iconic music themes ever composed by the music composer. 1 of the more dominant directorial demonstrations ever put on display thanks to the original master of suspense, the director. 1 of the heroic early Hollywood performances by either sex ever adorably attributed to the insatiably gorgeous goddess Janet Leigh and her perfectly crafted physique and soft face with insanely gorgeous bright (colorless) piercing eyes plus Janet's shirtless in her bra plenty. Psycho is 1 of the early forms of erotica with Janet's sultry, vivacious body of work here again, all praise be to Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee's mom! 1 of the great black and white movies of the time thanks to it being made in 1960! 1 of the great story concepts ever for a film! 1 of the scariest films ever shown. The BEST murder mystery ever told. The GREATEST spookiest serial killer portrayal ever seen all thanks to Norman Bates, I mean Anthony Perkins, and it probably always will be because I just watched Split the other day and trust me James McAvoy does not even compare even though I love Anya Taylor-Joy! 1 of the great horror villains ever thanks to Norman Bates and his crazy momma, and lastly and most incredibly and world renown, 1 of the most memorable, unexpected and most potent, shocking scenes ever seen in a film (let alone shower scenes) with the peephole and the gorgeous Janet Leigh and the shower curtain and the shower head and the knife and the wig and the robe and the blood and the water and the drain. I love Janet Leigh! The 1st half of Psycho is pure mastery, and the second half unfolds real nice. I love Vera Miles!",8,1,1,29 December 2018

Love Actually," Love Actually's Actually Very Good
",Love Actually is actually really good. The versatile ensemble cast is all-time great. Love Actually's actually an excellent Christmas movie even though it has nothing to do with Christmas but people are desperate for good Xmas movies because there are just not enough of them to go 'round it seems like but you just have to take what you get. Love Actually's actually really funny too. I adore Love Actually! It's a British hit. I love Laura Linney. She makes the movie with her performance. Good stuff. This is how you do intertwining character stories in a romcom with a bunch of stars from the United Kingdom. I especially like cutie Martine McCutcheon as Natalie. I wish she did more Hollywood movies she's great. LA is actually a classic Xmas movie that you can rewatch again and again. It's good basically. With a lot of Xmas cheer.,7,1,2,25 November 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of Tomorrow/Live Die Repeat/All You Need Is Kill/Live on the Edge/Edge
","This is a cool movie. And a very original one. The mimic aliens are fascinatingly fearsome foes and a refreshing alien breed while the armored warsuits the solders use to battle the mimics with are unique as well and also awesomely armed with futuristic machine guns as the suits transform a regular old soldier into a super fighting soldier. Tom Cruise with Emily Blunt makes this movie so damn good. Tom Cruise is fantastic and still looks great as far as I can see. Cruise is action-packed in this movie. Tom never disappoints. Meanwhile Emily Blunt plays the elite and most badass super soldier and is pretty convincing at it. I love the chopper blade Rita uses against the mimics. I love Emily Blunt. This movie has a creative and entertaining concept with Tom Cruise obtaining the power to reset the day whenever he dies. Groundhog Day meets Saving Private Ryan. Has anyone else said that before? This movie is really funny too. Bill Paxton is certainly hilarious in every scene he is in. Bill is great. And Breendon Gleeson is just the smartest and most inviting actor on screen. He is great. I love this movie. Tom Cruise is alright. He's got a great smile I guess. Emily does, too. Emily Blunt has a great, great body. This movie has a very satisfying ending. The song that plays when the end credits start to roll is a killer jam. What is this movie called again?",6,0,2,9 November 2014
Army of Darkness," Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness
","Army of Darkness is pulp art. It sacrifices being good using a normal centralized story design and instead it is good by executing unrefined, spattered entertainment from a different realm. Army of Darkness is a crazy comedy, not much of a horror. It's a unique movie with a great niche. Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash. Campbell's animated acting throughout the film is consistently approving as it never gets stale. Embeth Davidtz is so lovely and such a great actress. Embeth emits a true capturing characterization of the good and evil Sheila. Sam Raimi does an excellent job with the Evil Dead series. Raimi's true abilities are brought to life within Evil Dead's type of genre. I've never seen The Evil Dead or Evil Dead II but a little, but I understand Army of Darkness to be distinctly different from its prequels primarily for its comedy and as such Army of Darkness is the best of the 3.",6,1,3,13 July 2013
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Bram Stoker's Count Dracula
","Dracula has never looked this good, this show is a visual feast. It's loaded with spectacular shots throughout, an awesome story kudos to Bram Stoker shown in awesome fashion kudos to Francis Ford Coppola makes for a rather awesome movie. Call Dracula frightening, disturbing, haunting, it is, but it's quite powerful and quite beautiful. Dracula remains as some great love story. One of Coppola's finest works. The direction is outstanding. It has a very fine cast. Gary Oldman offers an excellent performance as Count Dracula, showing again his massive range as an actor. Winona Ryder bolsters the whimsical nature providing a sweet innocence with her talents, giving us a lens into the softer more heartfelt side of Dracula. Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing is terrific and creates a layer of appeal playing the quacked out, genius scientist hellbent on hunting Dracula. Keanu Reeves is not as bad an actor as you think, truly, and he does a fine job here. The costumes are particularly exquisite. Dracula is a lush and a dreadful and a ferocious tale. Give it a chance and you will feel moved.",8,2,4,22 February 2013
Con Air," Welcome to Con Air. Enjoy Your Flight.
","Con Air is a high flying quick streaming movie vessel that's carrying a mad gang of killer laughs delivering entertainment with a conviction in a fast speeding nonstop action-packed flight! In other words, Con Air is really, really good. It's awesome! I have to give it an all out 10 out of 10, even though I gave it an 8. Con Air is one of the very best popular culture blockbusters. From liftoff, it doesn't ever attempt to be the most acclaim worthy movie; that wasn't Con Air's intentioned destination. It sacrifices itself from having the most thought provoking intrigue in exchange for exceptional sheer on the surface movie entertainment. Movie goers would be blessed to have more all out fun movie going experiences like Con Air. It's funny, it's flattering, it's smart, it's assertive and confident, it's sweet, and the action, well, the action is as good as it gets. The characters from Con Air are in large part what makes it so great. It has great characters, played by great actors. Nicolas Cage is intensely incredible as Cameron Poe. Nicolas Cage is on fire in this movie! Cameron Poe is a badass action hero! No one could of done Cameron better. Cage is a topnotch movie star. John Malkovich hijacks the show with his incorrigible and encouraged performance as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom. John Malkovich is comfortably at his best in Con Air. John Cusack is slick and in heavy gear as good guy, Vince Larkin. John Cusack is such a good guy, too. Steve Bushscemi is scary good as scary bad, Garland Greene. Ving Rhames does fine wingman support as the easy-going Diamond Dog. Danny Trejo does fine wingman support too as the unapproachable and reproachful Johnny-23. Monica Potter fits the build beautifully in her role as Mrs. Poe. Potter has great chemistry with Nic Cage and with John Cusack. Dave Chappelle is well cast and probably the funniest dude on the whole planet. Con Air has really good in flight music.",8,0,0,16 January 2014

The Wrestler," The Wrestler Mickey Rourke The Legend
","Mickey Rourke gives an all out open honest performance for the ages in The Wrestler. Rourke holds nothing back in his true portrayal of aging professional wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson who is struggling to find his meaning to a lonely life. Mickey Rourke does a performance of a lifetime. He's never been this great, and in The Wrestler he IS great. Rourke will touch your heart moving you to tears in one of the greatest performances seen on film from anyone at anytime. Rourke really rocks! And in case if you didn't already know that Marisa Tomei has the sexiest body ever, you will after watching. Marisa's nude scenes are incredible. Her performance is outstanding, she can flat out act, man. Evan Rachel Wood too, no lie. The Wrestler has terrific writing and outstanding acting. It is a very pure reflection on real life. One of the purest put on film. The Wrestler receives a perfect 10. It's not a polished masterpiece, it's an unpolished masterpiece. Witness Randy 'The Ram' played by Mickey Rourke in all his glory in the best movie of 2008 and one of the best movies of the decade, The Wrestler.",10,1,1,4 May 2014
Kingpin," Roy Munson is a Hero, a Gen-u-ine Hero
","Kingpin's way up there among my favorite comedies, now, let's see, well, um, there's Dumb & Dumber (which was made by the Farrelly brothers & is my undisputed favorite comedy), there's Me, Myself & Irene (that was made by the Farrelly brothers), There's Something About Mary (made by the Farrelly brothers), and Shallow Hal (the Farrelly bros), Stuck On You, too (the Farrelly brothers made it!), aaaaaaaaand, oh yeah, Kingpin (made by, who else, the Farrelly brothers!). Wow, the Farrelly brothers make truly great comedies, don't they? These two brothers are incredibly funny as well as incredibly talented too. There's Something About Mary and Dumb & Dumber, I mean, those two alone. Those two alone are two of the best comedies ever made! And Kingpin is not too far behind them. Kingpin is just about the funniest movie. I love it. It's so good and funny all the way through.Woody Harrelson is simply golden as Roy Munson, former state champion bowler. Roy Munson is a tragically lovable soul. Woody is a real good and funny guy himself. Randy Quaid is hilarious as Ishmael. Randy Quaid was meant to do comedy; he really shines on screen. Vanessa Angel is gorgeous as Claudia. Vanessa is really so smoking hot in Kingpin. Her outfits that she wears, oh my God, they're too much. I tell ya, if I was given the power to create a beautiful woman all from scratch, you know, out of thin air, like with my computer or something, while I'm wearing a bra on my head, I am pretty sure that I'd create Vanessa Angel. She's unbelievable. (Note to self, go buy Weird Science DVD boxset immediately, is that available?) Listen, I don't want to make this entire review all about how hot Vanessa Angel is (oh wait, no, yes I do), but let me just say, I crush hard on Vanessa. She's something special. Somehow, I don't think that I'm alone.Kingpin is one classic comedy. If you can't believe me, just go watch it yourself, I mean, there's so much to laugh at! I gotta rate Kingpin a 7 but a strong 7, I mean, it's like honestly a 7.998, just barely under an 8, and mostly due to its story not being meaningfully heartfelt enough, that's the point I'm trying to make, Kingpin isn't meaningfully heartfelt enough to be a great 8, but it's oh so close. I love Kingpin, like I say, it's one of my favorite comedies. So all in closing, let me again say, I love Kingpin, Woody Harrelson is great, Roy Munson is a genuine hero, the Farrelly brothers are incredible, Randy Quaid's hilarious, Vanessa Angel is deeply hot, and Kingpin is way, way freaking laugh-out-loud funny! Go see for yourself! Thank you!(Oh and also, I about forgot, there's this one other man who is in Kingpin, he goes by the name, Bill Murray, and Bill's about the funniest, sweetest guy on the planet, and in Kingpin, Bill plays Ernie McCracken, who's like, the funniest, meanest guy on the planet)",7,0,1,16 January 2014

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The most entertaining Star Wars movie ever!
","I am not saying Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars, it's not. The first 2 movies, Episodes IV and V, are the best, and Return of the Jedi is even better too, but no other Star Wars movie is more fun to watch than RotS. The reason why? The special effects. It just looks better. The lightsaber battles are drastically more dynamic than in any of the original 3, and are much more visually appealing. The starship battles obviously look a lot better and are equipped with a much more detailed backdrop than ever before. Revenge of the Sith is all about action and special effects. The characters are obviously great but that's just because of Star Wars lore. The story of RotS is not that strong. The character development and interactions are not that strong. It actually does have it's share of good lines, but the overall quality of the writing is not that great. Basically, Revenge of the Sith strives on its visual effects, and strives very well might I add. It was a good movie, with some of the best special effects ever seen. It's not exactly grade-A storyline or dialogue, but it's just so dang, freagin' cool! I loved this movie! 9 outta 10!",9,1,2,22 June 2010

Inception," (there is no beginning & there is no end there is only) Inception
","The Nolan's Inception has similar inviting conceptualisms as does The Wachowski's The Matrix, but it just doesn't have any of the cool bullet dodging or adequate proper inspiration, which is to say the action is sub-par in this masterpiece gone awry, lost in limbo to say the least and to say the most, I think that if there would of been just a little bit more of a discern to entertain as the overall main objective of the movie and perhaps maybe even to shift the primary focus of the film a tad more towards the action orientations of the dreamworld as opposed to the overkill of dwelling upon the complexities of being in control of your own dreams and the unknown aspects of the human subconscious then Inception would be timeless. (I'd appreciate way more fighting and adventure and ACTION here and running away from bad guys I love how the enemies appear largely as faceless people coming out of nowhere but there's not enough of it also way, way, way, way forever way less explaining how it all works and more cool action scenes/Leo's character = too much talky & not enough doey) It still is timeless. I love Inception! It's a bit unimaginative! I'm not being nitpicky here, Inception is a surefire classic, obviously (I love Leo!), I'm just pointing out here that The Matrix is way cooler than this movie is (I love Keanu!) and will ever be but I still love it! Inception's great! It possessed a seemingly undeterred route to live on in infamy (they thought up the hard part) as this movie has stretches, bursts if you will of extreme utter sheer brilliance but everybody is wearing like suits, all suits, only suits and acting all rigid-like and it's sort of hard to follow honestly and stuff like what a waste of dream space. Inception isn't too rewatchable over the years and the most interesting part of the story (Leo's tormented love for Marion Cotillard who I love!) lacks life and spirit and meaning and fire. Ellen Page is awesome in this movie she really is what a great performance from her. I love Ellen! I love Leo and I really love Marion too. I love the rest of the cast as well. Thank you! Inception's an original mind bend that motivates you, awes you and leads you on straight down into the deep abyss of nothingness (a merry chase) like it goes nowhere (too much sitting, not enough kick, if you will)! 8 out of 10. I love all the stars! Inception is brutally good only very void!",8,0,0,18 February 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," A Throwback to Old Hollywood
","Based off the 1934 novel 'Murder on the Orient Express' written by Agatha Christie, and remake of the 1974 movie 'Murder on the Orient Express' starring Lauren Bacall, Albert Finney, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Vanessa Redgrave, Michael York among others which was also based off the 1934 novel 'Murder on the Orient Express' written by Agatha Christie, 'Murder on the Orient Express' (2017) starring Michelle 'I love you for life' Pfeiffer, Johnny 'Can't you see my mustache means business?'

I love all of it, I love the beautiful acting, I love the beautiful scenery, and most of all the beautiful story but I hate the CGI train shots, I'd rather have an actual train rolling by it slightly takes away from the caliber of the film, but not much. Was Kenneth Branagh nominated for this? OR WHAT? Was he? I don't know, if he wasn't well then he should have been. Was Murder on the Orient Express (in quotation marks) nominated for best picture? Was it? I don't know if it was I'm asking. It damn well and easily should've been. I feel like it probably wasn't, but maybe it was. I don't know who did it, but the revelation of who the killer(s) is in this it's all-time I love it. I love Michelle. When you watch MotOE for the first time through you're trying to read the actors' expressions and figure out who did it, but it was near to impossible not knowing the novel, and the second time through the movie is viewed upon in a completely new light, a completely new found light, a completely new found discovered light, a completely new found discovered revealing and loving light.",7,0,2,14 August 2018

My Mama says, Mama says foozball is the Devil! Water sucks! It really, really sucks! Bobby Bouche is the all-time greatest foozball player in movie history! Kathy Bates, Henry Winkler and Fairuza Bulk are hilarious and completely perfect for the Waterboy. Adam Sandler is the man as Waterboy and this is definitely 1 of his best and most forgotten best comedies, just like Big Daddy. Only Waterboy is way funnier.

WALL·E," All-time 'What just happened' movie...
","Oh my, you guys wanna love Wall-E so bad you refuse to admit how bad it gets halfway through. Am I the only one seeing this...The beginning truly is awesome, very quality. I thought I was watching an all-time great animated movie, then Wall-E goes to space and meets a bunch of fat humans, and it gets horrible! Really! It gets so bad...It's like they spent years on the beginning and a day on the end. None of the details are there anymore, the visuals get completely dull. I mean the Captain was the only character, all the other humans were drones. What brilliant writing...The second half of this flick is too simplistic and seems completely scattered. It seriously is just bad. It doesn't even look good. It's barely interesting. It's amazing the people who made the first part of this film made the second; was Wall-E a short story that had some Joe Blow writer come in and muster up this lame, uninspired ending to it? It doesn't make sense. Wall-E goes from A-quality to D-quality in a heartbeat.Apparently everyone who reviewed this film just watched half of it. How else could you rate this an 8.5?!? So overrated! Eww. Wall-E doesn't want your pity rating. I give it a 6.(First half of movie = 9/10, maybe even 10/10... / Second half = 3 out of 10/ Accumulative score = 1/10)",1,9,38,17 July 2010

I love Tom Hanks! I love Catherine Zeta Jones! Catherine Zeta Jones is so gorg! I really love Zoe Saldana too! The Terminal is a widely enjoyable, fun, festive, very jubilant, easy going, massively universal and brilliantly broadly scoped miraculous merry tale that's so purely underrated and so truly classic and if you ask me very rewatchable! Spielberg's Terminal is a one of a kind, well-framed from start to finish, kind-hearted, inspirational and loving film engulfing every imaginable emotion that there is! It's all about common people coming together commonly communing with one another with one common purpose and one ultimate common goal, commonality, no wait, commemoration I mean, to commemorate life and see the bright lights, glitz, glam and marvelous people of New York City as well as experiencing romance at one of its airports!

The Shawshank Redemption," Andy, Red and The Shawshank Redemption
","The Shawshank Redemption was originally released in 1994 and at the time it didn't receive its worthy praise, its due credit for being without any doubt one of the finest movies ever made, a gargantuan picture. It felt considered to be truly great, yet nothing quite remarkable, why is that? Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are majorly responsible. Also though when you're watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time you might take notice of how fanciful it is, seemingly sugarcoated, and may tend to initially and foolishly discount it as being a soft misrepresentation of life in Shawshank, but as the movie perseveres through gruesome occurrences and never shows a single imperfection, never seizes to amaze, it gradually becomes clear that this is a powerhouse of a movie, an undisputed masterpiece, and it's not a distorted viewpoint, it's just lighthearted and viewer-friendly, and you may be required to reassess your feelings towards the film to be valued as one of the very best movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is remarkable. It's one of the very few films that succeeds and even excels at depicting life on the brighter side while still maintaining enough darkly despair in proper prism. Prison isn't a fairy tale world. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't downgrade itself with a too grimy depiction; it's shown in a more pleasant way, in a more powerful way, and it's better this way, with no overstated unsavory trauma. The Shawshank Redemption is loaded with unsavory trauma, it just doesn't dwell on it. It ditches a grim outlook and upholds a faithful perspective. The Shawshank Redemption inspires great hope, even when your spirit has fallen into the darkest of places. Andy Dufresne is one of the best characters from film, period. Andy's unassuming, soft-spoken and distant nature makes him a prime target to befall victim to the hideous injustice of an ill-fated murder charge, but Andy is a brave soul, and he will seek redemption, even though Andy's very own soul is in most need of it. Andy's unfulfilled life has found new meaning in the most unlikely place, Shawshank. The story is among the best ever told. I venture to say that the narration provided by Red is the best, the very best of any movie. The narration doesn't compel you with startling plot developments, rather it guides you with reflection and comforts you throughout the indelicacies of the film. The narration is the driving force and the lasting impression of the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is mega engrossing; you do not quite know where it's heading, but you do not care because it is so good, and where it does eventually land is sheer brilliance, true movie magic. The end is simply genius, a clear metaphor for passing through hardship. I love that Red makes it to the good life too with Andy; this movie would have lost all of its might if not for its beautiful, happy ending. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare dramatic masterpieces as it's right up there on the short list of being the greatest movie of all-time. Give it its due. (Hummmmmmmmmmm...the #1 movie on the IMDb Top 250...that'll do.)",10,0,0,30 June 2013
Prometheus," Prometheus: Unknown Origin
","Ridley Scott's Prometheus is a sci-fi adventure about a space mission to an alien planet in search of an alien ship which may contain information about, you guessed it, aliens. Ridley Scott does fantastic direction work, like it comes so easy for him to do so with Promethus. You get a great full sense of Prometheus thanks to Ridley's beautiful lens. Prometheus has a very powerful visual developing story. It has awesome visuals. The special effects and set displays are rather breathtaking. The actors and acting are the lifeforce of this movie. Naomi Rapace stands out as really impressive in her first major appearance. The writing is good, and the writing is not so good. The writing is good for the action and character lines and interactions. The writing is not so good for the complete lack of an evident story. The story is empty and missing suspenseful interest. Prometheus has no business being associated with anything Ridley Scott has done before about an Alien, or Aliens. The infusion of an Alien relevance was so bad, that this is sadly the case. Prometheus is a really fine movie to see and it adds to the Alien movies about as much as a hamster adds to not laying turds in his cage.",6,0,0,29 June 2014

Blow," *Blow*
","Blow comes so close to being a great movie, but it fails. The story is awesome and very smart, the way it unfolds and the pacing is excellent. The soundtrack is really good and definitely helps. It's one of the coolest movies ever, it's just a little flawed. The characters here are hit or miss, and unfortunately the main character, George Jung, is a miss. It's not by any fault of Johnny Depp; he probably gives the best performance of anyone. The lines are just bad at times. The writing of dialogue is just bad at times. It makes characters lack depth and respond in unnatural, unbelievable ways. I don't know how else to say it other than it makes for an overall 'cheesy' vibe. You could say it lacks proper dramatic moments. Penelope Cruz is so underused in this movie too. Her character is so dry, I don't think she had any effective lines. Ray Liotta is great, but just like Depp his character suffers from bad writing. Bad acting isn't the issue here. A few of the characters completely work though. Jordi Molla as George's connection, Deigo Delgado, is just great, maybe the best in the movie, and Paul Reubens as Derek Foreal is well-written. Nick Cassevetes has a gift, clearly, but the characters all seem to personify his attitude in a sense. They need more variety. But the bad doesn't outweigh the good with Blow; it's still an awesome movie and certainly one of my 50 favorite films. You just have to enjoy Blow for what it is, one of the best drug/gangster movies ever, a cultural classic.",8,0,1,1 October 2010

It's right at the heart of the dance revolution flicks premiering towards the turn of the new millennium with Honey (2003) starring Jessica Alba of course then You Got Served (2004) cranked it up a notch then this in 2006 and Stomp the Yard (2007) shook things up the next year and you can even credit Center Stage (2000) way back in the day for starting it all!Step Up plays like a mixtape of some of your favorite hip-hop jams of the 2000s with Petey Pablo, T.I. and Ciara all contributing along the way and a great title track while R&B singers Mario and Drew Sidora actually show up to the party and kill it giving great performances!Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan interlude all of the cool, hot dance action with an inspiring and powerful true life love story that you just don't usually see play out onscreen as the main attraction. Dewan and Tatum fell in love in Step Up and that's definitely what makes this movie so special. They share genuine chemistry and they're so gorgeous together you can easily see why Tatum fell for her Jenna's amazingly beautiful and so sweet! Their love will last forever! Channing and Jenna split last year and they are no longer together, did you hear? I love Step Up! I love Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan too! I love dancing! And music!'ooh ah the way u look at me im feeling u!! ah i just cant help but trying 2 keep it coo-oo-ool!! i can feel it in the beat when u do those things 2 me dont let nothing stop u mooove ring the alarm the club is jumping now so get up!!!'",6,1,1,14 February 2019

The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises is a HORRIBLE Nolan Batman
","I'm stunned at how bad The Dark Knight Rises is; it's no where nearly as good as the first two, not...even...close, and no where nearly as good as I expected it would be.BATMAN IS BARELY IN IT!! What the...A BATMAN MOVIE WHERE BATMAN'S HARDLY IN IT!!Batman is barely the main star, and it's much too much Bruce Wayne. I don't get it, Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan, Bane being the main focus is one huge mistake. The Bane character is clearly good, he just does not belong in this Batman movie; it's a bad character adaptation. Bane doesn't stay true to the Batman villain franchise. The entire Batman formula is trashed in The Dark Knight Rises. Bane's too much think and not enough fight, maybe Bane needed less compose and more crazy; Bane needed some venom is what he needed. The whole damn movie needs some venom. It lacks luster. The Bane character also suffers because he's never really met with challenge by Batman. What the...not a single one of Bane's 'master' plans ever get thwarted; shouldn't have Batman returned some serious ass-kicking to Bane spoiling at least some of Bane's evil schemes? Yes. Batman is tragically underutilized and when Batman does finally show on screen, it's BAAAAD, suffering from no depth and no detail in the action sequences, no story. There's no story developing in detail which was excellently present in The Dark Knight, but The Dark Knight Rises' story development is vague and...full of holes...really holesy...missing points of interest. There's no dynamic connective consistency like there is in The Dark Knight, the supporting intangibles are WEEAAAAK. The Catwoman character and the Miranda character are HOORRIBLLLE. They brought nothing, and took everything. Why did all of Gotham City's cops go down in the sewers? Please, tell me. Why does the National Security appear in The Dark Knight Rises? I thought what happens in Gotham stays in Gotham, like Vegas. This Batman franchise has gone astray. Anytime a good moment does occur in The Dark Knight Rises, it feels out of place, like some last dying remnant of The Dark Knight. Every single character in this movie dies to absolutely zero effect. Foley, Miranda, Bane, and especially Batman, or does he die, oh who cares?With one fail release, The Dark Knight Rises has forever stained the Nolan's legacy. Chris Nolan's potential to be in the same class as Scorsese, Cameron, or Kubrick is apparently gone. Batman Begins as well as The Dark Knight were movies that were made for the fans, The Dark Knight Rises was made for the Nolans, and the same could be said for Inception. As the Nolan's stature increases their films are aiming less to appease the audiences and are becoming more self-serving. Their interpretations are growing less and less imaginative, as if they are prisoners in their own steel-trap minds. The Dark Knight Rises is 25% crafted masterpiece, 75% aimless agony. The movie is not capturing or engrossing at all. It's seriously bad, call it what you want, but it's seriously bad, for a Nolan Batman.Batman Begins was great, The Dark Knight was really awesome, The Dark Knight Rises is relative filth.",5,1,4,18 June 2013

","Bruce Almighty: good idea, good writing, good screenplay, good performances by Jim and Jennifer and Freeman, good humor, good heart, good direction, good editing, good sets, good everything!

X2: X-Men United," X2 - among the best COMICBOOK films!
","X2 is a great action/adventure filled with interesting characters, good writing, a good story, and awesome visuals. The special effects and the action scenes are striking, and they can take you by storm, and they're kind of beast. The story in support is X-cellent. It has great pace, good dialogue. X-Men 2 is one of the very best comic book films, topping the first of the series making it one of cinema's great sequels.The cast is very good top to bottom, lead by the performances of Ian McKellan and Brian Cox. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, Alan Cumming, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, very solid. The characters shine and are the focal point throughout. The story isn't exactly complete but it is very good and it does a terrific job of holding the film together. The writing as well as the directing by Bryan Singer is very good. It's too bad for X-Men fans that Singer chose to abandon the franchise and go do Superman. X-Men 3 suffers for it. The action sequences of X2 unfold nicely and are very fun for the viewer to see with some great mutant battles. Though the film lacks great scope and can be somewhat one dimensional, it should be appreciated for its gorgeous visuals and awesome action. This is a movie that I really love, upping it from an 8, giving it a 9 out of 10. I'm a big fan of the X-Men and I look forward to hopefully many X-Men movies in future years.",9,0,1,28 December 2012
Casino," How can you watch this film and not think it's brilliant?
","Casino is an absolute masterpiece. It is easily one of the very best movies ever, but ya it is no Goodfellas, so i guess it stinks. If Casino was titled Goodfellas 2, then I could understand the critiques, but it is a totally different movie, err. None of them make any sense. Every reason I have read that supposedly makes this movie bad is something that doesn't even factor in to whether a movie is good or not. Too much violence - first off, Casino is not excessively violent. The things that happen are but it's obviously not so severe that it's too repulsive to bare or anything close (same goes for Goodfellas). That's nonsense, just like all the other excuses. I am still waiting for one reason to why Casino is not a 4-star, all-time classic movie. I can understand how some can watch it and perceive that it's boring, but you have to listen...there's so much going on. So much depth to the characters. And Scorsese is a genius with editing and directing a film. Casino is an unstoppable movie. It's easily cemented into my top 10. It is one of the most underrated movies with a 3 out of 4 star rating; that is an insult to this masterful film. What are you guys seeing? Nothing is wrong with it. Every scene is powerful. Way to go Scorcese. You give us another cinema classic, and get no love. This movie should be top 20 in the Top250 list, a perfect 10 outta 10.Brilliant depth in the acting and writing, great pace, great soundtrack, great storytelling, a superb attention to detail, natural dialogue, and top-notch directing.",10,1,2,21 June 2010
Heat," The Heat Is On
","When cops and robbers square off in the city there's a deluxe of human intrigue and drama to be on display; when Al Pacino and Robert De Niro face off on-screen in Heat there's solely cinematic bliss. These two Hollywood heavyweights carry their weight to help create a classic good guy vs. bad guy telling. Heat stands as one of our finest crime-dramas. It has great directing, great writing and supreme acting. The acting is as good as it gets. The cast assembled rivals most any movie. De Niro and Pacino are both awesome in their lead roles. Val Kilmer is outstanding, like he often is, Ashley Judd makes her mark here and Jon Voight delivers some polished acting grit. I must mention a young Natalie Portman who reveals her brilliant acting aptitude in limited screen time. Michael Mann does a terrific job behind the camera. His direction is sharp and poignant. Mann's style is very effective for the course of this movie and he really excels during the action sequences. Heat has a very good story. The primary plot is excellent, but some of the supporting plot lines are lacking. There are lingering scenes scattered throughout. Heat's intensity wanes in and out, and it does not quite sustain a desirable level of suspense throughout. Though the good scenes are so, so good. The diner scene presents the greatest clash of actors ever seen, Al and Bobby, toe-to-toe. This thrusts right into the bank heist scene. Be prepared to get blasted in the face as the most captivating and spectacular gun shootout scene ever seen unfolds between De Niro's crew and Pacino's task force. Once Heat picks up, it becomes enthralling. A can't miss. Do yourself a favor and go watch this movie if you haven't already. It's great.",9,2,6,23 April 2013
Get Him to the Greek," All I See Is Stars Please Get Him to the Greek
","This is a ballsy comedy but Aldous and Jackie should have been in it more and Hill shouldn't of. This movie gets straight into it with Jackie Q & Aldous Snow/Rose 'I want to ring a desert rose around her Outback posey' Byrne & 'Randy' Russell 'from across from Brussels' Brand. Brand's actually from Essex, U.K. Rose is from New South Wales, Australia. I just slaughtered those nicknames. Hill could never get a girl like Elizabeth 'way more gorgeous and healthier looking than Kate Moss' Moss Moss is so cute UNLIKE Jonah 'always being joaned on can't seem to ever get over the hill' Hill 'because he's so portly', and cute and talented. I love Jonah Hill! I love Brand too he's over the hill now though in Hollywood and life and his career's f'ing dead. There I said it. Brand is so gorgeous and so f'ing cool that I personally know as a heterosexual male that I would love to hug him and love him and hold him and maybe embrace him as the friendly man he is. Brand's hilarious! Get Him to the Greek is hilarious and it's clearly exceptional material from the start to finish outside of P. Diddy just kidding lol. 1 of the best comedies of the decade! I feel like this is a better movie for women to enjoy than for men but I'm a man.'we got the clap! u got the clap! we cook the rocks & u took the smack aw uU! we got the itch u got the scratch burns burns burns like a helluva a batch !! u took the front i took the back aw uuu! we got the clap!

Easy A," Ahem hem hem, Easy A is Easy (ily) A (hit)
","Totally relatable, totally cool, totally clever, totally cute, totally charming, totally sexy, totally smart, and totally real and down-to-earth totally original high school family hit with an insanely super hot young Emma Stone, Easy A. I own this movie on Blu-ray. I love Emma Stone. I bought this amusing, funny, and hilarious comedy with a lot of good heart on Blu-ray because I really love it, and in addition to that, Emma has some really hot scenes in it like the beginning when she's singing the worst song ever in the shower and her pajamas (mid-sentence edit: Emma's face is so aesthetically appealing/insanely attractive, I love all the closeups of her face in Easy A, and her freckles), or the funny bedroom scene at the cocktail party where Emma takes off her red panties and hangs them on the door knob, or Emma by the pool in her two sizes too small blue and yellow gym outfit (mse: OMG! Emma's butt and legs in the sun with the pretty water in the background/the pool scene!! I love it), or Emma's dance number in the end. EMMA'S REALLY SExY in this, based off The Scarlett Letter (not the '95 Demi Moore version but I love that movie too.). This flick has a great message for young people, gossip is silly, and usually unfounded and wrong. Emma's cute, really, REALLY cute, and hot, so hot. She's sensational. This is her best movie. I love Emma Stone and Easy A.'i got a pocket got a pocket full of sunshine...'(Easy A quietly has brilliant casting i.e. Emma & Aly & Amanda Bynes & Thomas Haden Church & Patricia Clarkson & Stanley Tucci & Lisa Kudrow)",6,0,0,16 October 2018
Apollo 13," The Astronauts of Apollo 13 - 'Houston, We Have A Problem.'
","The true story of the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission back from 1971 captured the world and its people at the time gripping them with death-defying suspense. The film Apollo 13 does more than a magnificent job of imitating this space navigation near-tragedy. The real life details from this NASA lunar mission may be a little technically shaky but Apollo 13 depicts the event in a cleaned presentable way. It's just a tad too pretty though it's painted in a polite light so it's perfectly fine. I particularly enjoy, even possibly prefer the lighter lens it's filtered through. It certainly does not devalue the movie in even the slightest degree. Apollo 13 is one of the most incredible family dramas. The minor flaws of it, the direction is a bit rigid, the on screen story needs a broader scope, it could have used a vaster array of supporting characters, are noticeable, but forgivable. It doesn't fully diminish the overall greatness of this amazing cinematic achievement. The daunting and heartfelt nature of this storied event overwhelms and awes the viewer. What a spectacular feat for humanity. These astronauts endured an unbelievable journey to the moon and back. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are all American heroes. Apollo 13's filled with stars, having a great mixture of genuine talent and chiseled acting. Ed Harris is a damn powerful actor in amongst the very best and extraordinarily mister Tom Hanks is even better. Hanks and Harris are astounding in their roles as Jim Lovell and Gene Kranz as the two men hold most the mass in this heroic space adventure. Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan are all strong in their supporting roles and they're all tremendously impassioned. Gary Sinise shines bright, giving us one of his best lovable performances. Ron Howard did a great job with what he had to work with; this is obviously one of Howard's best films. I greatly adore Apollo 13, it's a wonderful and an amazing movie, a 9.5 out of 10! I already have and will certainly continue to watch over and over again this touching and marvelous family adventure.",10,0,0,30 June 2013

Fantastic Four," Fantastic Four is Fantastic !
","Well, it's fantastic enough, I mean, the script writing, the plot points, the story details and development are rather weak in Fantastic Four which makes the adventures of Fantastic Four in this movie a little cheesy, but it's so much fun and entertaining that you can forget about it and really love it! The characters and special effects and action is most of the show in Fantastic Four. I love how the superheroes combine their superpowers to use them together. That's what makes the Fantastic Four so fantastic!The Fantastic Four is played fantastically by 4 fantastic stars! Ioan Gruffudd is Mr. Fantastic aka Dr. Reeds Richards. Gruffudd is excellent in his lead supplying the most personally intriguing character. Jessica Alba is The Invisible Woman aka Sue Storm. Jessica is great in this film and I wouldn't replace her if I could but I don't think she resembles a good Sue Storm. Alba is almost too good looking for the part, she is, and I don't know if I bought her and Gruffudd as a compatible couple, but I'm jealous, so. I don't think she was the best to be The Invisible Woman but I loved her in this movie anyways and she is my main attraction to the film. Chris Evans is The Human Torch aka Johnny Storm. Chris Evans does great as the brash and cocky Johnny and Chris is even hotter than a super nova! Check him out, no, no wait, what I mean to say is Jessica Alba is hotter than a supernova. Check her out. Yeah, that's it. She is. He is, too. You can see Chris Evans emerging into a can't miss star. Michael Chiklis is The Thing aka Ben Grimm. Chiklis at the time is peaking in his acting career and let's be thankful he landed this part because he's really good as The Thing and Chiklis only makes the movie better. Jilian McMahon is Dr. Doom aka Victor von Doom and McMahon very solidly plays one believable arch villain.I really love the superheroes that makeup The Fantastic Four. I love how each member standing alone possesses their own invulnerability. The super elastic Mr. Fantastic cannot be crushed or clutched or critically harmed with conventional hand-to-hand combat. The Invisible Woman can go invisible, go figure, and she is also able to create a energy force field around herself or anything else for protection. The Human Torch has the ability to 'Flame on!' turning himself into a blazing fireball impervious to extreme heat. And The Thing is a strong guy with super human strength and an impenetrable rock-solid body. You can drop any one of the Fantastic Four into any dangerous situation and they will fair okay, but together as a team, The Fantastic Four is unstoppable!Thank you, filmmakers for a thoroughly enjoyable viewing, but most of all, thank you, Stan Lee. I can't begin to thank you enough, Mr. Stan Lee, so just for starters, I thank you for The Fantastic Four. They're fantastic!",5,0,3,1 March 2014

I love it!p.s. they overthought it/hate the timeline hate the drama hate the slower parts/couldn't they have just started the movie with the discovery of the shimmer at the lighthouse then fill in all the blanks with like 1 or maybe 2 at most flashbacks then maybe bring a few more deadly weapons like grenades being that every single previous other team of soldiers who went on into the shimmer is dead in an insane way but the end is nice but why not just let the weird alien shapeshifting thingy just be instead of whatever the hell that weird alien thingy likes doing mimicing and morphing/have you seen aliens?/i love jennifer jason leigh and gina rodriguez and tessa thompson and annihilation/natalie portman rules",5,1,6,18 October 2019

The Ugly Truth," The review's called The Ugly Truth, if you can't face it, don't read.
","Katy Perry rules! Women run the world, and rule it. Men love Katherine Heigl. People are more willing to forgive a fat guy. Whistles catch people's attention. Duck tastes just like chicken. Women in ponytail buns and glasses look professional. People love Who's the Boss? reruns, especially the one where the vacuum breaks. Women rally. Women go to the bathroom in pairs. It's good to floss every day. Tall women dating short men is a little uncomfortable. It's not smart to take the liberty of printing out your date's profile or talking points then present them during dinner on your first date. Women love cats. Men love dogs. Men are simple and cannot be trained. It's good to exercise sometimes. Women love to fantasize with men. Katherine is not ugly, at all. No one watches intimate profiles of the mayor. Eavesdropping's okay. Men like a woman on top, just kidding. It's polite to knock. Men love local public access television programming. Women tend to get angry and bitter. Sex is healthy for you. Keep the doors closed so a bird doesn't fly in the office. The truth's offensive. Men and women wouldn't even speak if not for social pressure, status, and sex. Women are funnier than men. It's no big deal to say erection on network television. A married man and woman news anchor team is good for ratings. I love Bree Turner. Answering machines are old school. You're supposed to always be mean to 25 year old girls who think they're hot and can get any guy they want, NOT 14 year old girls. Blondes have more fun. Peeping outside your neighbor's window can be innocent if rescuing your cat from a tree, and dangerous! Women love men doctors. When a woman gets a man's number she should call right away and just say anything. Men too. Gerald and Katherine have good chemistry together. Men pick semi-naked chicks wrestling in strawberry-flavored goo over classical music and candlelit dinner. Oops, it's cherry. Wrestling babes swimming in Jell-O are tasty, if you know what I mean. Men aren't smart enough. Men love naked weather girls. Bad dreams aren't real. Katherine and Gerald are funny together. Women shouldn't listen to men's bad dating advice and should do exactly the opposite of what they say. Women tend to get desperate. Women know about mature emotions and deep abiding love and men know about lust, seduction and manipulation. Men and women work well together. Men are predictable. Women never criticize even if it's constructive because men are incapable of growth, change, or progress, for men self-improvement ends at toilet training and laugh at whatever he says even if what he says isn't funny, that's irrelevant because a fake laugh is like a fake orgasm, it's not good but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all. Men are very visual. Women's choice in clothing makes a statement. All men are perverse. It's a woman's responsibility to inspire an erection, it's not his job. Katherine has a beautiful face, and a super hot bod. Women don't know how to flirt, and men can't handle it when they actually do. Katherine turns me on, there's no maybe about it. Women love baseball. Women tend to be clumsy. Katherine Heigl is sweet. It's okay to talk about sex to children. Primates are very intelligent. Women love men who are good with children. Gerald and Katherine are sexy together. It's fun to picture the opposite sex when you masturbate. Love starts from within. Vibrating briefs can be orgasmic, and so can watching Katherine change into them. I love Katherine Heigl and I love The Ugly Truth. Katherine in The Ugly Truth makes me horny.",6,0,4,14 May 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," Let's all go to The Cabin in the Woods!
","Cabin in the Woods is a modern horror classic even though the movie is mediocre at large portions of times. It tries to be funny and scary at the same time but it's really not. Joss Wheedon, way to go. What it is though, to the best of my knowledge ability, is simply entertaining with a terrifyingly twisted ending.The beginning ---> trip to the cabin is basically horrible being way too slow without establishing any kind of recognizable plot line and poorish character dialogue.The middle ---> arrival at the cabin and nightfall is resembling of your standard good slasher horror with nothing much special but a creepy cabin in the woods that's not as creepy as u maybe think but actually is way more creepy then you ever imagined.And the end ---> escape from the evil cabin in the woods is the big payoff. The end is nuts!! The end is so crazy it makes you wanna watch the movie over again right after the first time seeing it. The elevator lobby scene with the swat team says it all!I've said too much but that's where it's at. Don't judge this movie 'til it's over. Cabin in the Woods scores major points for horror originality and a fun and imaginative ending. I liked it and that's okay. Watch this movie for the ending!",6,1,1,10 July 2015
Braveheart," Braveheart is the BEST MOVIE of ALL-TIME!!!
","It's not even close. The directing is A+, Mel Gibson did as perfect of a job as you can do with all the camera-work and cuts, which is really something considering he was the lead role. He also gave an awesome performance as William Wallace. Saying Braveheart is historically inaccurate is nonsense, really; the true life of Wallace has nothing to do with this movie. That is not that hard a concept. When critiquing Braveheart I find two very minor flaws - Gibson's accent isn't the greatest, but, he's not Scottish, so I don't see that as significant, and the extras in the war scenes just suck in some scenes. You can see if you look closely that all of the combat does not appear authentic. These are the only two faults I can find, and they are rather trivial. Everything else works. The story of Braveheart is as epic as it gets, man loses true love, gets revenge on the entire country responsible and frees his homeland and its people in the process. It's presented in exquisite fashion. The pace of Braveheart is impeccable. The love scenes in the beginning in no way are sluggish. They serve as the calm before the storm. The writing is excellent in these scenes, as are the interactions between Wallace and Murron. The love story really jumps forward quickly, and you are soon thrust into warfare. Braveheart is not excessively violent. The gory moments serve their purpose and are not overstated. The overall writing of the movie is very smart. There are no unnatural moments or lines for any characters. The characters are all well portrayed. The acting is subtle and very polished. Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks was outstanding. The cinematography of Braveheart is as good as it gets; it might stand alone as the best ever in this area. The visuals are epic. The music is epic. The score of Braveheart is so, so strong. It continually adds to the viewing experience throughout. The ending of Braveheart is easily the best of any film. Braveheart gives you all the emotions you could ask for and does a great job of mixing light-hearted moments within all the serious drama. No other movie matches the 'epicness' and beauty of Braveheart, thus, making it the greatest movie of all-time! Bow to Mel Gibson.[!]BEST MOVIE EVER[!]**********(Do you realize how many negative reviews there are for Braveheart that only cite the historical inaccuracies as the main reason it sucked? The real William Wallace has nothing to do with this movie!!! Why can't you comprehend that? Is this a documentary?.....What are you talking about! The real, true life of the real William Wallace has nothing to do with Braveheart. Braveheart is a movie, a tale of fantasy!!!! Not a documentary!!! The movie Goodfellas is about real life gangsters, who really existed, but the events happened differently from how they did in real life, so does that mean Goodfellas sucks because it's historically inaccurate? Same goes for about a million other movies, take your pick. Since when were movies supposed to be history lessons? The film doesn't say 'true story' or 'based on a true story' or anything like that in the opening credits or anywhere. Oh I get it, the character's name is William Wallace so that makes it real. Ha Ha, you're entire argument 'this movie sucks because that's not what really happened' is so, so foolish. So ignorant. It holds no water, a completely stale argument. Completely erroneous. The shame is that Braveheart might be the top movie on the Top250 list if it weren't for the strong percentage of reviews saying it's historically inaccurate, but it still rates an impressive 8.4, even with all you blind-to-the-fact haters. Blind to the fact that the real William Wallace has no bearing on Braveheart. None. Completely irrelevant. Again, this is not that hard a concept.....)",10,4,10,15 September 2010
Gladiator," The Gladiator
","I can say there's only one issue with this movie; the Emperor just doesn't seem believable. I didn't buy it. Why would he get in the arena and challenge a foe he knows he can't beat one on one when he has an entire army at his disposal? That's the major issue. If the Emperor was really crazy enough to do something like that, then he should of been a completely different character; he was portrayed in the wrong way. Just the fact that this movie ends by Maximus getting his revenge in a 1 on 1 death duel against the Emperor seems so lame and so Hollywood. Couldn't you give us an intelligent, realistic ending (like the Emperor has Maximus executed but then someone else comes in Mark Wahlberg in The Departed style and ends up killing the Emperor anyways)? Something other than the simple A-to-B ending it has. It's just a shame because it's such an awesome, epic movie. The writing and story is so smart; there's not a single bad scene. The visuals are epic. The Emperor character is the only reason this beast of a movie earns a 9, not a 10.",9,2,4,2 October 2010

Back to the Future," 1 of the All-Time Special Beloved Great Movies from the '80s or any decade or any time era you want! I love Michael J. Fox!

Goodfellas," Classic in every sense of the word.
","This is one of the very best movies you will ever see. It is true art. Martin Scorcese did a masterful job with the directing, music, editing. The acting is superb, maybe the best I've seen. The stars, Deniro, Pesci, Liotta, Bracco, and Sorvino were all brilliant. One of the best scripts ever. The dialogue seems more realistic and natural than in any other movie. The story's great. The characters themselves, Jimmy Conway, Tommy DeVito and Henry Hill are absolutely fascinating. The way this films allows us to delve into these mobsters lives is a true experience, and it is all brought to life by Scorcese. Probably the best direction I've seen in a film. Every scene is so perfectly crafted. The pace of the film seems flawless, it completely grasps hold of you from start to finish. Goodfellas is presented on screen in a way that no film rivals. It is so true to call it the most uncompromising movie ever, it's completely original. Goodfellas is the 2nd best movie I've ever seen, better than Godfather and all that. If I had to pick one movie to watch for the rest of my life, it would no doubt be Goodfellas.'Whoa! Can't believe what I just heard. Hey Spider, here. This is for you.' 'I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers.'",10,0,0,5 July 2010
The Proposal," 1 Superhot Sandy B. + 1 Supergorg Ryan R. / Malin & Mary S. & T. Nelson & B. White x intense incredible nonstop exhilarating pure uncontrollable delight = The Proposal (a 6)
","Sandra Bullock is so disgustingly & so viciously & so ruthlessly hot in this movie, The Proposal with Ryan Reynolds, it's unbelievable & so's Sandy. Ryan too. This is Sandra's MOST HOT movie! Oh my God I love her & it. Oh thank you sweet maker for Sandy Bullock. Her hair color is GORGEOUS on a level that I cannot describe. It's like dark with like light streaks in it. I used to think supergorg Sandy B. was like a top 50 superhot & superepic sweet & sexy & dope incredibly sweet & hot movie babe of all-time when this first came out back in like 2009 but now, in 2018, I'm convinced Sandra's like TOP 25! Of ALLL-TIIIME! Whoa. Sandy's sizzling in The Proposal and so's Ryan. Ryan's maybe like top 50 movie hunk I don't even know. He looks sexy as F. Sandy too. I really love The Proposal & it's really good almost a 6. I want to give it a 6. It's a 6. The goodhearted end makes up for all the sweet & silly & funny foreplay throughout. Proposal's perfectly predicated around Sandy & Ryan's (superhot & supersweet) 'naked hot dripping wet bodies colliding' nude scene in the upstairs cabin bedroom & I love it & I love Malin & I really love Mary St. & Craig T. & I love Betty & R. Reynolds & I do love beautiful, funny, & determined & super hot Sandra Bullock x 1,000,000%.",6,0,3,30 July 2018
Jurassic Park," Welcome to Jurassic Park
","I remember first seeing Jurassic Park in the movie theater alongside my family as a young kid. I remember us having very close front row seats probably because we didn't get there early enough and the theater was packed. The movie begins rolling and I'm watching the movie and I'm enjoying it and I'm enjoying myself and it's a really good movie! But then when the scene with the T-Rex comes up, you know, that scene where the T-Rex escapes through the fencing of his no longer electric, electric cage........I got so scared during that scene! I was so frightened that I had to excuse myself out of my front row seat, walk all the way down the aisle, out of the theater into the lobby, acting like I was just leaving to go use the restroom. Yeah, right, I picked the moment smack dab square in the middle of the very best part of the whole movie to just go leave and use the restroom. Who was I fooling? I didn't have to go pee. I was terrified! I probably almost peed my pants! The T-Rex looked so real, and felt so real! It sounded real too! I know though that I at least made it through to the part where the massive T-Rex starts spinning the kids' vehicle with his huge snout, with the kids trapped inside it, but once the T-Rex started stomping their SUV, crushing the kids underneath, all while letting out a spine tingling and ferocious roar.....I was out of there, and in a hurry! I went and hung around in the restroom for a little bit, not really doing much. When I got back to my seat in the theater, it was at the time when the T-Rex is chasing Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum in their speeding away vehicle, where Goldblum is laying on the back of the jeep, all too injured to move but not too hurt to punch out a few wisecracks, and then the T-Rex explodes out of the trees and is right on their tail! I thought that I might have to go to the restroom again. I sat back down and was able to make it through the rest of the movie just fine, and my dad knew that I had been a little shaken up, so he rest assured me and let me know that it was all okay.I loved Jurassic Park back when I first saw it then and I still love it now today. It's one incredible feature. The whole point of just sharing with you my recollection of when I first saw Jurassic Park on the big screen was that...the dinosaurs looked so dang freagin' real! Way to go, Steven Spielberg! The CGI special effects of Jurassic Park's dinosaurs is truly impressive and groundbreaking stuff. I know Spielberg wasn't planning on using computer graphics on the dinosaurs, fearing that the computers wouldn't be advanced enough to replicate realistic looking reptiles that an audience could believe, but upon further digital exploration, some technicians tinkering around with some software, Spielberg and the technicians had a moment of discovery realizing that they could indeed use computer animations for the dinosaurs, and that the technology was good enough after all! Boy, does it show! That's called fate, my friends. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are awesome and incredible! They're a mammoth cinematic achievement on a behemoth scale!Jurassic Park is a great, beloved movie, thanks to Michael Crichton who wrote the novel, Steven Spielberg, and special thanks to the actors, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Bob Peck and Martin Ferrero whom all give better than good performances, great performances. Steven Spielberg did an outstanding job directing. The theme by John Williams is beautiful and inspiring. I love that tune! The Jurassic Park is one of the great sets of any movie. I rate Jurassic Park a 9, I cannot give it an all out 10 because the movie is too mainstream and commercialized, and also, there's that one scene with Laura Dern and the raptors that takes place in the maintenance shed that wasn't quite on par with the rest of the film's scenes. That scene needed a little bit of tinkering. The scene with the stampeding herd of gallimimus is possibly Jurassic Park's best part. The T-Rex scene, too, is just as spectacular. My favorite moment is probably when the characters first see the giant brontosaurus, and the other dinosaurs, and John Williams score is blaring in the background. 'They do move in herds.' Wow, what an amazing movie Jurassic Park was, and still is! I love Jurassic Park!",9,3,3,11 January 2014
Rock Star," Upbeat Turn of the Century Passionate Rock Classic Stars Mark Wahlberg & Jennifer Aniston!
","Unlike Mark's leather-skin pants, not the greatest material, but there's 100% nothing not to love about Rock Star. It rocks and it's really sweet! Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston's sexy chemistry and good looks are delicious for the viewing. Jennifer is so yummy. So yummy. Mark's tasty too. This is a great love story set in a romanticized rock n' roll world that's not all drugs, sex, and rock and roll. This is a really beautiful, lovely movie. Rock Star is a little hokey-dokey, like a lapel jacket, but it makes up for it with its true heartfelt passion for the art, and its ripping rock tunes and wailing rock chords, and for the ultra-beautiful and the ultra-desirable and the ultra-attractive and the ultra-I-love-you Jennifer with sexy Mark. Rock Star's a real nice film to enjoy with your romantic other. Jenny is soo hot in Rock Star, holy rocking balls! She's the hottest rock babe of all-time! She makes me want to stand up and shouuuuuuuuuuuuuut! That see-through fishnet dress Aniston wears with her glittery makeup and her hair down up in a high ponytail with her glistening bangs and starry eyes during the concert and the afterparty where I can see barely Jennifer is wearing a thong but not wearing a bra when Mark's making out with her and that one lusty babe/man dancing in the nightclub is awesomely erotic and cool and almost makes me want to be a rock star as much as it makes me want to be a movie star. It reminds me of a little tamer yet hotter version of that nightclub scene straight out of Basic Instinct with Sharon Stone, what a hot scene this is, thanks for it, Jennifer. You, are, so, sweet.'it makes my stomach tuuuurn..aaand it tears my flesh from boone..hoooow we turn a dream to stone and we aall diiiie yoooooooooooooooung!'",5,0,0,3 May 2018
