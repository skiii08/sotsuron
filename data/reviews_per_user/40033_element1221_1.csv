The Blair Witch Project," terrible as hell
","This movie is so terrible.Not only is the plot stupid but yet they spend half the movie walking. Nothing remotely scary happens except for when pine branches fall *Ahhh scary* (sarcasm). This is shaky camera footage and NO F*&^%$%$ING SCRIPT it is so retarded and is the worst movie ever if you watch it i wont stop you but it sucks bad i bought for 2 bucks and gave it to my friend.1,123452 thumbs so far down if you watch it you will laugh your ass off half the movie because of how lame it is. Today i bought Blair witch 2 for 2 bucks again and if its bad i will burn it in a bonfire BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO to who ever made this masterpiece Not",1,0,3,3 February 2005
