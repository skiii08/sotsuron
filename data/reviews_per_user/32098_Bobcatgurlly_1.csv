Miracle," great movie for anyone that enjoys the sport of hockey!
","I love this movie. I think that it tops out at one of the best sport movie ever, probably any movie. Anyway, with the hockey scenes they used great camera angles to actually create the emotion which is totally awesome. Most other hockey movies, let alone any other sport movie, never got this close to the action. Also to get 'inside' of the players and coach's mind, to see what was really going on in their heads. Also to be giving hints of America's down time throughout the movie was great background and created more emotion and drama. Which is great in my book. Not to mention the hockey players were total hotties:)",10,1,1,29 June 2005
