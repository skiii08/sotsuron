The Sound of Music," Move Over'Casablanca','The Sound of Music'takes 'Most Romantic Film of All Time'!
","'The Sound of Music'is the best film I ever saw! It has all the elements of a great film classic;romance,suspense,lots of comedy,and a perfect cast. Julie Andrews is perfect as Maria;a sweet,lively,postulant in Salzburg,Austria.Though she tries,Maria just can't fit into the strict Abbey life.So she takes a summer job as a governess to the seven children of local Naval hero Georg von Trapp,a lonely, bitter widower who runs his household like the ships he commanded. It takes all of Maria's charm to win over his mischievous children and melt the Captain's icy heart.After a crafty love story that grows over the entire plot,Maria and the Captain see the Light. If you want to find out the rest,rent the film,I'M not giving it away.HA HA!",Null,0,5,30 March 2000
