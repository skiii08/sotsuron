He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking.An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX.

The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island.This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover.

As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves.Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men??The answer is .........................watch the film to find out.My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.",8,2,3,16 February 2013

Hot Fuzz," What you thinking?.............Pub?
","Story/Plot - PC Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is at the top of his game. He has high arrest rates and has reduced crime. However, those above him are worried that if he stays in London he will continue to make them and the rest of the London police force look really bad. As a result of this PC Angel is pushed out of London and into a sleepy Gloucestershire town of Sandford.Now Sergeant Angel, he teams up with a hapless PC named Danny Butterman whose father is the towns chief of police. The Sandford police force seems to have a way of punishment for in-house problems, and that is cake and ice cream.Out and about on their daily duties Danny is constantly asking Nicholas about aspects of his previous action in London, curious to see what happens outside of a law abiding town. Or is it really a law abiding community.Two actors are decapitated in a road traffic collision, which the community and police are branding an accident. Sgt Angel on the other hand has his doubts, doubts which are soon added on by further deaths in the community. Sgt Angel is pushed out of town by the so called neighbour hood watch.On his return Sgt. Angel with PC Butterman by his side take on the neighbour hood in a shoot out. Only one side can be victorious.My Verdict - I have watched Hot Fuzz several times and each time I laugh just as hard as before. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg have a brilliant on screen relationship and can bond their characters into what the writers have portrayed. They compliment each other in different ways and make an excellent pairing.Edgar Wright has co written and directed a comedy masterpiece and a film that will continue to be loved for decades more.I will always recommend Hot Fuzz for everyone to see. From filling a dull rainy afternoon to a film you watch with a loved one and beyond. If you want to laugh and I mean laugh, you must watch Hot Fuzz.",10,0,0,16 February 2013

The story line had a lot of heart in it and portrayed the life of a young rapper wanting to make it big and the problems he faced to do so. A must watch film for any rap fan and anyone who likes a film full of heart. Set in Detroit where the 8 Mile is a boundary between where and who you want to be. Eminem plays his character very well and the stuff he sings has meaning and actually sounds good (I'm not a big rap fan). The late Brittany Murphy acts her character to her full potential and as always has a very appealing charm about her.",8,0,0,13 February 2013
