Minority Report," 'Everybody Runs'
","Minority Report is a movie loosely based on the story 'A Minority Report' by Philip K. Dick. (I say loosely based because the original story was a short story.)Steven Spielberg directed it, and this movie is excellently executed. The story is about a chief law enforcer who's able to stop crimes before they happen, so there hasn't been a single murder in five years. He thinks everything about the system is perfect, until he's predicted to kill a person he never knew. Dodging law enforcement and danger, he takes a PreCog to help him get to the bottom of the crime, but he becomes convinced that the would be victim took his son from him years ago and he just might die for that. The plot of this movie was very interesting and it had a great plot twist. However, the story gets a little confusing at some parts and the very ending of it dosen't fit very well.The movie has great special effects and action sequences, and none of scenes just go into the 'the special effects are so cool that we don't need to tell the story right.' The title really isn't a very good title for the movie, but that's all I'm going to say about it.All in all, this is a great movie and I recommend that you watch it.",10,0,0,31 March 2013
Citizen Kane," My Citizen Kane Review
","Though critically bashed when it first came out, Citizen Kane was called by the AFI 'The Best Movie Ever'. It's not THE best for me, but I thought it was a great movie. Charles Foster Kane dies and says 'Rosebud' and people have to figure out what that means in order to do a documentary about him by asking about what his life was like. The plot is great and the acting is great also. If you pay close attention to this movie, then you'll enjoy what Rosebud comes out to be. That, or you might feel ripped off and really angry. Either you love this movie, you think this is a very slow-moving, boring movie. My rating: ****/*****",9,0,1,9 June 2012
A Bug's Life," Tried to Be Creative, But Dosen't Work Out
","PIXAR's second full-length movie, and the first completely computer generated movie to appear in widescreen, A Bug's Life, dosen't work out. In this movie, clumsy but creative inventor ant Flick accidentally ruins the food for the villainous grasshoppers. He uses the help of a group of insects who are actually circus bugs to defend the ant colony from the grasshoppers. The story is OK, but most of the characters aren't very good. I thought that Hopper and Flick were the only good characters in this movie. The jokes were poorly delivered. The only good joke I found in this movie was 'he stared in a film called 'Picnic.' This is actually what I thought was the worst of the PIXAR films. If you're a big fan of PIXAR movies, then you may watch this, but isn't not done very well. My Rating: */****",3,2,4,16 August 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Inception in Reverse
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a little known science fiction movie of 2004. (I never heard of it until I watched The Simpsons episode 'Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind.) In this movie, basically the movie Inception in reverse, a woman erases all her memories of her boyfriend, who decides to do the same thing. However, when deleting his memories, he feels that he's still attracted to her and tries to go back in his memory and stop his mind from being erased. The movie had a very interesting and imaginative story and it was also pretty complicated.The acting was great. I recommend this movie to anyone.My Rating *****/*****",10,1,2,26 July 2012
Stranger Than Fiction," Great
","The first time I heard about this movie, I thought it was going be a slapstick comedy. The movie is much more dramatic, but still funny in a few spots. The plot is about an IRS agent who lives his entire life alone and everything he does-figuratively and literally-is controlled by his stop watch. A weird thing happens one day when he starts hearing an author narrating his life. The author is in control of his plans, his love interest and (possibly) his death. The story is very interesting and creative. The acting was great, too. I recommend that you should see this movie if you enjoy books, movies or if you just want to kill time. My Rating: ***/****",8,0,0,19 June 2012
WALLÂ·E," '2001 Rip-Off' is Great
","WALL-E is another movie from the emotional 'geniuses' at PIXAR. The movie is about a lonely trash compactor in the future (who coincidentally looks like the robot from Short Circuit) who sees a female robot and falls in love with. He shows her a plant, then she goes into a deep sleep and is taken into space, where WALL-E follows her and meets dim-witted, obese humans. From then on, the movie pretty much goes down the same way as Stanely Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' does with an environmental message. The opening sequence is great, opening with a song from 'Hello, Dolly' and setting up the story with little dialogue, which could be boring for some. The animation is great, like PIXAR has a knack for. There is an emotional appeal in this movie. It's not as sad as 'Up' or the 'Toy Story' movies or 'Finding Nemo,' though. If you like animated movies, you might want to watch this. ****/*****",8,0,1,3 June 2012
The Emperor's New Groove," Good for Families
","The Emperor's New Groove is an animated comedy movie from Disney. This one centers on selfish, greedy, bratty and egoistical (Incan) Emperor Kuzco who wants to build a summer paradise on a nice peasant's house. At the same time, he fires his adviser Yzma and her well-built but dimwitted assistant Kronk who devise a plane to kill the emperor. But instead turn him into a llama and must team up with the peasant, who believes that the emperor is becoming a better person. The jokes were mostly breaking the fourth wall, common slapstick and references. (The Fly reference was hilarious). The story is paced out well, entertaining and easy to understand. I recommend this movie to people who like cartoons.***/*****",7,1,2,12 May 2012
The Birds," Good, Until the Last Twenty Minutes
","The Birds is an iconic movie from Alfred Hitchcock. The story is about a woman who is attacked by a seagull and later kids and other people are, too. The acting is great. The story is very interesting, there are scenes of suspense, but everything falls apart in the last twenty minutes. The house being attacked being by birds near the ending is a good scene. However, the woman apparently forgot about everything that happened and carried a flashlight to where the birds were (she was attacked by birds and she also learned that they're attracted to light!) and gets attacked by them. The scene prior repeats, but this time more hurried. The ending shot is one of the worst scenes in this movie. I recommend this film to any Alfred Hitchcock fan. My Rating: 6/10",6,3,10,2 July 2012
