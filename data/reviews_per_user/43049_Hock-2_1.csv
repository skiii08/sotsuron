The Blair Witch Project," Wow....a breath of fresh air from the Hollywood norm!!!
",I had the fortunate experience to view this movie about 5 months ago and I was totally freaked out the first time that I saw it.  I have now seen it over 20 times and it still gives me goosebumps.  This movie is a great example that you don't need millions of dollars to make a good movie.  Just a good idea and lots of talent.  This movie is absolutely awesome and I hope people will give it the respect that it deserves.,10,3,6,23 August 1999
