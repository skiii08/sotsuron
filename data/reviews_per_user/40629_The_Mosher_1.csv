Walk the Line," Amazing, Brilliant, Sensitive, Moving and Inspiring! :-D
","OMG!! This film is absolutely awesome, and Joaquin Phoenix again shows us exactly how much of a good actor he really is. If he was looking for a film that would separate him from being 'River's Brother' to 'A Good Actor', then this was it. The film is sensitive, funny, and there is no doubt whatsoever that Phoenix is Cash. Reese Witherspoon is amazing too, she's real, and her and Joaquin work on screen like they were born to do this film together. The soundtrack is pretty jaw dropping too, with Phoenix and Witherspoon singing and playing their instruments for real throughout the film, and overall this is one of those films that you can watch, and then watch again without any problem because it is so bloody good!! I give it a 12/10, and definite Oscars to Phoenix and Witherspoon!!",10,0,0,14 February 2006
