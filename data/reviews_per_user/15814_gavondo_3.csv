It," It (2017) in one word: Unrelenting
","There were some horror movies from my childhood that stuck with me for many years. One Halloween, after returning home from trick-or- treating, my dad was watching Sleepwalkers (1992), also adapted from a Stephen King novel. Images from that movie haunted me for at least the following decade. I've never seen that movie since, but I saw the cat-man character in my closet countless times as I tried to fall asleep. I imagine that some of the images from It will be with me for some time as well. Skarsgard, as Pennywise, is excellent, but perhaps not as excellent as the effects for his character, which are masterfully chilling. Each time a demented creature transforms into Pennywise, or as he contorts his body and moves so unnaturally, I couldn't look away even though I wanted to. It's marvelous. On many occasions, one of the kids sees a monster in broad daylight. They are outside, it's sunny, but the monsters are still completely terrifying, the kids' fear palpable. Outdoors, with the sun shining, isn't that supposed to be the sanctuary? That's supposed to be the place you go to escape fears, to feel safe, because nothing can lurk in the darkness when there is no darkness. But, there are no safe places in the town of Derry. Pennywise is the villain yes, but not the only villain, and perhaps not the most evil. The villains of bullying and abuse fill the spaces between Pennywise's jarring, jittery appearances. They fill those spaces so completely, and fill the film with such constant dread, that each appearance of the clown almost feels commonplace. Pennywise manifests a child's worst fears, and those fears don't rest. Those fears are commonplace. But there is hope in teamwork and friendship. In It, this, not sunshine, is the refuge. And the chemistry between the kids is another way the film excels. The young actors have any easy nature about them, excluding Finn Wolfhard, of Stranger Things fame. It feels as if the writers tried a bit too hard to make Wolfhard's character, Richie, seem cool, relying heavily on crude remarks that feel forced. It's distracting, but as a whole, the gang shines, particularly the performances of Jack Grazer (Eddie) and Sophia Lillis (Beverly). Time will tell if the cast of characters 40-years senior will be of comparable quality in Part II.More reviews: medium.com/@gavondo",9,2,4,24 October 2017
Everest," Everest (2015) in one word: Heartwrenching
","I had a pretty good idea of how Everest would play out. I read Krakauer's account of the 1996 tragedy, Into Thin Air, a number of years ago. I could recall the general story- a lot of people die. But, I couldn't remember who died exactly, so some of the story's suspense was preserved for me.However, that suspense is likely to be present regardless of whether or not the viewer knows the details of the story. You almost can't help but be filled with dread as the movie progresses. The cinematography is breathtakingly vertigo-inducing at times, as the camera pivots under and around characters, highlighting the immense depths of chasms and the brutal, potential consequences of a misstep. Early in the film, it becomes evident that there is a problem of overcrowding on the mountain. Everest expeditions are businesses, and ones that seek to all accomplish the same goal in the same brief window, once per year. Rob Hall, played convincingly and endearingly by Jason Clarke, attempts to gather the different companies and work out some sort of solution. The tension between characters in this meeting serves as a precursor to the tension and confusion that will manifest itself near the mountain's summit.There are many characters in Everest, yet I feel that all of them are adequately developed. They are developed to the point that when characters die it is genuinely heartbreaking. The death of expedition leader Rob Hall is particularly moving. In contrast to the deaths of other characters, several of whom simply fall off a ledge, Rob's is not quick. We spend extensive amounts of time with him, as team members and his wife (Keira Knightley) attempt to motivate him to keep him alive and moving. It is watching someone at the very edge of human limits, and it is painful.There has long been debate about the veracity of accounts and depictions of the 1996 Everest expeditions. Krakauer, for one, is not a fan of the way Everest portrays what happened, calling it 'total bull.' It is, however, unlikely that we will ever be able to hash out all the details of the tragedy. Everest is successful in depicting perhaps the most important element of those events in 1996- that many passionate mountaineers, on a mountain that pushes people to limits, found their limits, and lost their lives.More reviews: medium.com/@gavondo",8,0,1,24 October 2017
American Made," American Made (2017) in one word: Cruise-control
","American Made begins with the familiar text, 'Based on a true story.' Movies based on true stories, which are not vetted by any type of historical regulatory agency to my knowledge, often end with a prologue containing additional historical information about the subjects. Photographs of the real-life individuals are sometimes shown on screen at this point in the film. There are no such photographs in this film. I took this as a sign that the real Barry Seal, a DEA informant and drug smuggler, didn't bear much resemblance to the actor portraying him, Tom Cruise. A post-credits image search confirmed this suspicion. Doug Liman, director, addressed this, saying, 'Tom Cruise doesn't look like Barry Seal. His character is inspired by the stories we learned about Barry. ' He added, 'You know, we're not making a biopic.' Unfettered by history, writer Gary Spinelli was free to tailor the story for Cruise, and in this he was successful.In Top Gun, Cruise plays a handsome, cocky, talented pilot. In American Made, Cruise plays a handsome, cocky, talented, drug and arms trafficking pilot. It feels familiar, but it's a good 'seeing an old friend' familiar. Cruise is at his best when he is somewhat frantic, and there is a lot of frantic in this film. In fact, frantic is likely the best word to describe the camera-work here. Cinematographer CÃ©sar Charlone (City of God) zooms in and out with the speed and erraticism of an octogenarian photographing a grandchild at graduation. Seal is always moving, and the camera rushes to keep up with him. As cash continues to roll in, Barry Seal frenetically searches for an empty closet, a fresh piece of ground, but to no avail. There is plentiful comedy in the ineptitude of Seal, because he isn't entirely inept. At times he is shrewd and scheming, adept at evading his enemies. But, the true comedy and tragedy are in the excess, the scale of Seal's operation. The mere existence of such a 'business' and the associated connections, if not only tenuous, to the U.S. government is laughably inconceivable.Seal's recorded confessions serve as plot perpetuators, interspersed among the action. This is an effective plot device, and the achieved feel of the home videos is authentic and somewhat endearing. Sarah Wright, as Seal's wife Lucy, provides a lukewarm contrast to her husband's mostly unwarranted confidence. She repeatedly declares her distrust for Seal, but brushes aside all concerns once sufficient funds have been brought home. Her patience could exist only in the imagination of Seal, who, in reality, married three times. But again, this is not a film about reality. Suspending history, it is a thoroughly entertaining, energetic romp that capitalizes on the strong points of its male lead.More reviews: medium.com/@gavondo",6,0,2,24 October 2017
