The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Favorite Movie Ever
",This is my all time favorite movie!! The plot is so relatable and I respect that. I have watched this so many times and every time I watch it I get the same enjoyable experience as the first time I watched it :) I cannot rave about how much I love this enough!! It is an emotional roller coaster and it is like you are going through it along with Charlie. I always recommend it to my friends if they have not seen it and make them watch it with me so I can experience it with them. It is very similar to the book and I enjoy that because a lot of movies in the past have ruined the books. This movie kept me captivated and interested the entire time. Best 102 minutes of my life and for that I give it a 10/10!!,10,1,2,13 February 2016
