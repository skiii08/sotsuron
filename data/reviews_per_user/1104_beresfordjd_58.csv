The Sound of Music," Awful
","I really hate this film with it's saccharine sweet heroine and drippy kids. Christopher Plummer is beyond hateful and the whole shebang has these dreadful songs most of which Andrews sings as though presenting an elocution lesson. How it became the most watched and successful movie of its time is astonishing. Stories of numpties who have seen it 3,000,000 times at the cinema and love it more than life is really puzzling. I always wanted the Nazis to find them and incarcerate them somewhere dreadful and do terrible things to them because they were so sickeningly sweet. Julie Andrews hated the image that she became stuck with after TSOM and May Poppins but more fool her for even doing such dross.",2,6,25,10 July 2016
Training Day," A revelation!!
","While I always knew that Denzel is one of the very best screen actors of the modern age, it was a revelation to see what a great villain he could be. That said, he was still Denzel the charmer as Alonzo in Training Day. We even began to believe that he was redeemable after he shot the Scott Glenn character as he explaining that that sort of thing was a necessary evil. I was annoyed that Eva Mendes was nominated for an award for an appearance that lasted seconds over all. Also cameos from Snoop, Macy and Dr Dre were totally redundant and distracted this viewer. They really do not have the chops for parts like that. Ethan Hawke was terrific in this film too and was the perfect foil for Mr Washington. It has been a long time since I saw TD originally and it impressed me greatly then. The impact has not lessened over the years.",9,0,2,12 March 2017
The Hunger Games," Good but...
",I have to say I came late to this film and overall it was enjoyable. Jennifer Lawrence deserved the plaudits heaped on her and I was surprised to see Josh Hutchinson come out of it so well. I was not keen on the art direction as far as make up was concerned - the weird-shaped beard was impossible for anyone to maintain and the 'futuristic' hairstyles just looked ridiculous. I liked the premise but for Jennifer's character to manage to survive without hardly killing anyone was a cop-out. Yes she caused a death and retaliated and killed someone but I think if she had gone after some of the other tributes then it would have been more realistic. It will be interesting to see how they make the sequel and what the jumping-off point may be. My main complaint about this film is the amount of hand-held camera-work. As someone else pointed out it is nauseating seen on the big screen - believe me it is the same on a home TV. A very unnecessary technique too much employed in a lot of modern films. It adds nothing.,7,1,5,4 January 2015
Ted," As I expected
","I have been watching this film for about 30 minutes. I have yet to smile , let alone laugh. it just proves to me that Hollywood will and does do ANYTHING to make money. Mark Wahlberg is not my favourite actor but he has made some good movies. Why oh why did he make this piece of crud? The special effects are pretty good but it is the only special thing about this movie. What is all the fuss about Mila Kunis? She is average looking and no better or worse an actress than any other. It is symptomatic of modern so-called 'comedies' that no-one can say anything without foul language. This thing is just so crude it is untrue. I am not a prude and have no problem with bad language, I just object to it when people think crudity is funny in itself. There is nothing witty or clever about this script - how it got commissioned is beyond me.",1,7,16,6 May 2013
About Time," Thoroughly enjoyable
","I only give this 9 because of Rachel McAdams. She was good in it but I have just seen her too much of late. The film was a real surprise - it was sentimental but it was never mawkish. Bill Nighy was his usual reliable self and I enjoyed the main guy's performance (I forget his name). I too fell in love with the actress who played Charlotte , what a babe!! It was well written and plotted though there did seem to be one or two plot holes at times. Richard Curtis seems to be still at the top of his game as a writer and now he directs with the same sure touch. I had read poor reviews of this movie and avoided watching it for some time. I have to ignore reviews in the future and make my own decision.",9,2,3,17 August 2014
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Boring/Engrossing/puzzling/excellent.
","I have only just gotten round to watching this movie. I have never read a Le Carre book and the only things I have seen were The Spy Who came in from the Cold (I was too young to follow and understand it!) and The Night Manager which was brilliant. So what did I think of it? It is all in the title of my review. I did feel all of those emotions. Boring - only the first few minutes. It engrossed me for most of the movie and puzzled me too. All round I found it excellent.It took it's time to tell the story and gave very little away. The actors all gave good value and Gary Oldman as the main character was good but underplayed incredibly. I enjoyed Tom Hardy's contribution and Benedict Cumberbatch was as good as he always is. I liked the way it did not spoon feed the viewer with information but allowed the plot to unfold slowly but surely. A pity Kathy Burke was not in it more as she is an incredible actress. Not a film for people who like action movies, it is much more cerebral than that.",8,0,2,10 April 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Law of diminishing returns.
","Yawn! Another superhero movie. Tom Hollander is an OK Peter Parker but cannot dispel the boredom I am experiencing while watching this. Just more of the sae old, same old.",3,1,4,1 April 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," hate it
","This film has always left me cold. Yes I do get it! No, I am no bored teenager with the attention span of a gnat.I am 59 and a lover of movies of all genres. When I first saw it I think I was too young to appreciate it and I have tried several times over the last few decades to see it with new eyes. However it just does not work for me. Peter Sellers is over used in this (and he is a favourite of mine) and it unbalances the whole thing. Slim Pickens and George C. Scott are great but cannot save this. Quite simply it bores me to tears, I find my mind wandering and am unable to enjoy it. I have seen most of Kubricks movies and find them cold and uninvolving with the exceptions of Spartacus(how much was him?) Paths of Glory and The Killing. Overrated is the term I would employ. I do think the cinematography is great and the sentiment of the whole thing is admirable. But as entertainment it falls down badly (and above all movies should be entertaining even when thought-provoking).",4,12,30,29 April 2007
Knocked Up," witless and insulting
","I am afraid I must be getting old!! I switched this movie on expecting a modern romantic comedy. Is this what passes for romance these days? Kids, you are being sold very very short. The actors in this piece are good (Paul Rudd is a great comic actor) but this was just depressing. I curse and swear much worse than the characters in this, but somehow found myself appalled by the gratuitous vile language heard throughout Knocked Up. As the film progressed I became more and more disinterested in the story and the characters. Eventually I fast forwarded the remaining 45 mins. It had such potential but that was wasted for a few cheap laughs (which never came).It could have been so much better. Back to the drawing board and film school for the authors of this one.",2,3,7,23 July 2008
Blades of Glory," Average to poor!
","Poor writing, obvious humour and 'phone-in' performances leave this movie among the usual Will Ferrell (often Ben Stiller ) fare. I notice Stiller produced this 'nuff said!!There is no wit originality or decent quality in this. Many recent American so-called comedy movies suffer from this sort of complacent conception. Take someone from Saturday Night Live (and don't get me started on that load of dung) that has been moderately successful and put them in a series of indifferent vehicles that will show off their very indifferent 'talents'. I keep trying them but am always disappointed. Talk about the triumph of hope over experience!! Please do not waste your time on this kind of movie. There are better comic actors around, more subtle writers and more involving stories to tell.",3,0,1,4 May 2008
Horrible Bosses," Only Bridesmaids is worse
",Another huge disappointment just like Bridesmaids was. The movie has a great cast but is so poorly executed that the potential is totally wasted. I imagine that Kevin Spacey is mortified that he agreed to do this rubbish. It is actually a great premise but is seriously badly done. It is crude in the extreme and all the foul language does not make it any funnier. There are moments when one can see what might have been but they are few and far between. Jennifer Aniston has great comic timing but employing her to use such crudity is a waste of her talent. Obviously none of this was aimed at my demographic as I am too offended by the gratuitous use of the 'f' word amongst other profanities I know no-one that uses language like this so liberally - I do swear myself so to be offended by swearing seems ludicrous but when it is not real it jars. Give it a big miss.,2,2,5,16 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," CGI fail
","The Clone movie is supposed to take place many years before the original trilogy, so why does it look so much more technologically advanced? I am aware that Lucas had much more money to spend and his company had advanced the CGI thing much further than was available in 1970's. Part of the charm of the original film was that everything looked used and battered- almost nothing in the earlier films looked that way. Hayden , simply, was not up to the job and had zero chemistry with Natalie, though we were told that was the reason for casting them. Ewan McGregor whom I rate as an actor was limited by his need to channel Sir Alec. I have watched these prequels 3 times and find my mind wandering which never happened with the original films. Mind you none of those first three had Jar Jar Binks - a mistake of gargantuan dimensions which seemed impossible for a filmmaker of Lucas' experience to make. Many of the characters had voices where it was difficult to catch what they were saying (Watto and Binks come to mind). After 3 viewings they do not seem as awful as they, at first seemed but they are still a huge disappointment.",6,2,9,19 December 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," Terrific - only one fault
","This film does not reach 10/10 because of the absolutely dreadful 'song' during the credits! The same happened in The Bourne Supremacy. I do not know who wrote them but they were poor lyrically and the 'music' was beyond awful. An extremely poor way to end such wonderful films. I came late to the Bourne movies thinking that I may not like them but once I had dipped into the first , I found them unmissable. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne perfectly and the supporting cast are equally as good. The action sequences are unbelievably exciting and really well directed and cut. My feeling is that the films are practically perfect. How anyone co-ordinates the teams who film in the many worldwide locations is just beyond me. Morocco,London,Naples, New York, Berlin and Moscow - it is mindblowing how well the sequences fit together seamlessly.",9,0,3,10 June 2017
The Aviator," Terrific performances
","A brilliant film which brings out amazing performances from Leo Di Caprio,Cate Blanchette and Alan Alda. I have seen it three times and it gets better every time. Scorcese is not my favourite director but he brings home the bacon in this film. How Di Caprio did not get an academy award is beyond me - I believe he should have won at least 3 by now. I think he must have rubbed someone up the wrong way in Hollywood and they are denying him because of some imagined slight. The Aviator is a long film but never seems to be so as the story absorbs the viewer totally. I would recommend it to anyone. It is beautiful to look at and tells Howard Hughes' story really well",9,0,0,11 November 2015
Bridge of Spies," Query - Rylance 's Oscar.
","I enjoyed this movie more than I thought would - Tom Hanks is his usual brilliant self and Spielberg directs this really well. My only problem is with Mark Rylance getting an Oscar for his turn as Abel the Soviet spy. He always underplays and I personally do not rate his acting talents at all. He is so laid back as to be almost horizontal. It is, by its subject, a very talky movie but it is well written and none of the talk is wasted time. It is absorbing and interesting about a time when I had little interest in world politics. It all makes sense to me now.",8,0,4,15 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Best one so far
","I have made a point of watching the movies, in order of course, and to say I have been disappointed is an understatement.Now I love fantasy movies and still think The Lord of the Rings Trilogy has yet to be bettered. I have found the HP franchise not good enough given the hype that surrounds them. That said I really quite enjoyed this first part of the final film - Daniel, Rupert and even Emma were so much better in this than the earlier films. The only other one I liked was The Order of the Phoenix even though it was about half an hour too long. The Deathly Hallows Pt 1 is a much more grown up movie and is the better for it. I would say it is even genuinely scary in parts. Daniel Radcliffe in particular is maturing as an actor and has had a difficult job carrying so many movies - if he had been no good then the whole thing would not have worked.",7,1,3,3 May 2012
Wanted," Not aimed at me but.....
","I have only just gotten round to watching this film and although I am not it's target audience (I'm 64) I just loved it. James McAvoy proves his versatility as an actor (I have yet to see him in two roles that are alike) and he carries it off with aplomb. Jolie is as drop-dead gorgeous as ever and I was delighted to see Marc Warren (Hustle) in a supporting role. The only jarring note, as he always is for me, is Terence Stamp, who seems unable to deliver any line convincingly , no matter what the role may be. Luckily Stamp has a very brief role in this. The action is pretty relentless, mainly physically impossible, but truly imaginative and really exciting.This is the sort of movie where you check your incredulity in the minute it starts - if you can do that you are in for a treat. my wife hated it but it is a boy's movie definitely. I would like to see a sequel if it could be done as well as this.",8,2,5,17 May 2012
Van Helsing," Third Time is a charm
","I have tried this 3 times and hated it it twice. In fact never finished it.This time I am enjoying it. It is, without doubt,total piffle , but if you do not take it seriously and treat it as a comedy then it is entertaining piffle. If it is possible in an action movie (because that is what this is) there is too much action-it is exhausting to watch. The physical feats that the main characters perform are impossible and inventive if a little ridiculous. David Wenham has fun with his part as does Jackman and Beckinsale but I bet they were glad when it was over-though Kate has done similar roles since. CGI is fine, if used economically, but it is all over this and detracts from the visual rather than enhancing it as it is easily spotted. Much more enjoyable, though , than I first thought.",7,0,1,13 June 2010
Spirited Away," Eh?
","I find it hard to believe that anyone rates this film at all. Not one minute of this makes any sense. The animation is not as artistic as the fans of anime would have it. The story is ridiculous and the execution poor in the extreme. Anime is not my favourite form anyway but a good story is a good story especially if it is well executed. This garbage is neither a good story or well executed. It is as though some anime guy has just completed a bad LSD trip and committed it to film. There is no explanation of any happenings in the movie and all sorts of things happen surreal and otherwise and are just left to hang in the air. Pseuds would say that is the 'art' in it. I say it's just daft and confusing for the viewer. There is little or no emotion in this endeavour either. Girl has parents turned to pigs-why? Maybe it makes more sense in the subtitled version than the dreadfully dubbed version but I doubt it very much. Another thing I hate about anime is the insistence in denying the 'Japanese-ness' of the characters. They are drawn as westernised as any Pixar or Disney character. The only clue to its ethnic origin is the costume and backgrounds. All the kudos heaped on this tosh is a severe case of The Emperor's New Clothes. Avoid this rubbish , it is time you will never get back.",1,57,189,2 January 2010
Tropic Thunder," I tried ,I really did.
","I have attempted to watch this film twice, thinking that maybe I just was not in the mood first time around. I actually thought it was worse than I thought the second time! The worst of bad ideas is summed up with this film. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are not my most favourite of actors but I really love Robert Downey. Unfortunately Downey made a really bad mistake by taking part in this abortion. The humour just does not work and the satire is far too heavy handed to hit home. There was obviously a lot of money spent on this but it was wasted on effects and not spent on the script. Anyone who can find this rubbish amusing must be of such low intelligence and expectations it is hardly measurable. A total waste of a great cast (Stiller and Black excepted) and a script fished out from the bottom of a deep, deep waste bin . I think I would maybe class this as a vanity project for Stiller and an indulgence by Cruise and Downey. It's success astonishes me - it is a long SNL script and a bad one at that.",1,6,15,11 October 2015
The Duchess," Surprised by this piece
","I recorded this from TV months ago and only got round to watching it last night. My wife and I loved it. I was not expecting anything like so good after reading so-so reviews and hearing about the parallels with the Charles and Diana story. Yes there were parallels and I assume that there was that motivation for the movie. However it was more than that, a true story well told. I have never been a great fan of Keira Knightley but she really nailed this one. She went from young innocent to world weary woman through the course of the film and acquitted herself well her best performance since Atonement. Fiennes was great as her unfeeling, rigid husband too and avoided the cartoon villain that he could have been. However the weak link for me was Dominic Cooper - he just did not look right and was rather unconvincing as a possible (and eventual) Prime Minister. That aside a most enjoyable and absorbing movie, shot in the most gorgeous of stately homes (sets?).",8,0,0,21 November 2011
Bridesmaids," Appalling
","I saw odd clips of this movie and thought 'that looks quite entertaining' How wrong was I? VERY wrong. It lacked wit, charm, a decent script and a cast that one could warm to.Only Melissa McCarthy(?) acquitted herself fairly well. Rose Byrne was a real disappointment after having seen her in Damages. Miss Wiig was just annoying and really not very funny at all. It seems that the SNL participants only travel well in the States as I have rarely found any of them funny enough to drag me into a movie. The whole movie lacked wit and any kind of intelligent humour. After the hype about it Bridesmaids could not help but be a huge disappointment. It was just another gross out movie but made by women. The fact that the main cast were women was about the only thing to recommend it. A great pity that it was just not up to it for me. It's now August 2015 and I thought I would give it another go in case it was me and not the movie. It is actually worse than I remember - not even a smile was raised and I consider myself to have a good sense of humour. Not a single person in the movie was likable and seemed to have any comedic talent at all. It is almost a guarantee of dire results if Matt Lucas is in it and Chris O'Dowd is just chronic. If I could give this ordure a minus score then I would. Where are the comedies with the quality and wit of Some Like It Hot? Where are the scriptwriters who can really sharpen up a screenplay and make it work? Utter utter shite is the only description I can give to rubbish like this. The cinema-going public must be morons if they enjoy this stuff.",1,2,7,28 July 2012
The Chorus," Marvellous - Please do not remake in English!!
","I recorded this on my Sky Plus box out of curiosity, because I had heard good things about it. Those good things were more than justified. I have never really enjoyed subtitled movies and I am sure I miss a lot of good stuff because of my prejudice against them. However I started watching this and was totally enthralled within minutes. Jugnot's performance was superb and the whole thing was wonderfully uplifting and, dare I say it, I was blubbing like a baby at certain points (usually musical) during the movie. While the story has parallels in other films (Mr Hollands Opus, Dead Poets Society - to name a couple)it still resonated as an original treatment. The main character is not a charismatic, handsome type but he carries the story and he should have got an Oscar as should the score. Cannot finish without mentioning the young actor who played Morhange-he has a haunting, beautiful face (the face of an angel they say in the film) and a terrific voice. All round great performances, script, direction and music. I do not give it 10 out of 10 only for the fact that it has subtitles-how shallow of me!! However I do not want to see it dubbed or remade as a slick Hollywood treatment!!",10,2,3,1 May 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," disappointing
",I have seen this 3 times now and always hoped to assuage the disappointment I felt on my first viewing. The principal actors are good - Chow Yun Fat has a real presence on screen as does Michelle Leoh but the plot such as it is is dull in the extreme. Some of the movie is beautifully shot but the action scenes are almost laughable. Seeing CTHD put me off this kind of film until I caught Hero on TV. I bought Hero on Blu-ray and it is sumptuous and really artistic - everything that I was led to believe Crouching Tiger was. This film's success must have been as a result of the Hollywood hype surrounding it. It certainly does not live up to one's expectations of it.,4,0,5,14 January 2012
2012," utter piffle
","How can anyone make such a turkey as this? CGI effects are way over the top and the number of 'and with a single bound he was free' occasions just make this whole thing laughable. I find it hard to understand how great actors, and there are some in this pile of poo, can get themselves into kitsch fluff like this. It misses out on every level. In spite of the premise there is no tension,excitement or wonder at this movie. Yet there should be - the story is tailor-made for all those things. Emmerich should hang his head in shame. Independence Day was a similar idea - destruction on a grand scale etc, but that was involving and exciting in a way that 2012 never is. I guess everyone took part because they were handsomely rewarded. I bet they still wish that they hadn't. My headline is utter piffle because that is what this awful movie is. And it gets worse the more you see of it!",3,0,1,12 June 2010
The Incredibles," Odd
","I am torn about this movie. The ideas herein are great but somehow this film does not quite work for me. Maybe it is the voice-overs-Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson are not really up to it. As for Bird voicing a character himself I think that too was a bad idea. There is certainly something lacking for me. The humour is not as sharp as other Pixar movies and there were times when I was actually bored. It was too much like a Bond film at times, far too derivative. Pixar has made some of the most enjoyable movies of the past few years and the standard is so high it is difficult to achieve expectations - this film fell short for me as did Wall-E. Both are the sort of film I would normally love but neither quite float my boat. I look forward to seeing Up as I am told it is excellent.",6,0,1,27 December 2009
Stardust," Surprised
","I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film. It was not the best thing in fantasy I have ever seen but it was really entertaining. A fairly original story well told with excellent special effects. It was a joy to see De Niro in a real departure for him and also thoroughly enjoying himself. Michelle Pfeiffer I love in anything she does and she too has fun with the part ( and a very passable accent too). Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughan have made a good job of the writing but I would have liked a little less modern idiom and something a little more classic in the way that characters speak. The humour is spot on appealing to children and adults alike. Mark Strong gives excellent value as a dark villain, brooding and menacing. I loved seeing all the British comic actors like Mark Williams, Ricky Gervais and David Walliams in small but effective parts, adding atmosphere and amusement to the movie. I have watched it twice now and enjoyed it more the second time. Well worth a viewing.",9,2,3,27 March 2010
School of Rock," Appalling concept!!!
","I hated the very idea of this movie and when I saw it on TV I almost turned it off after 5 minutes. However I did not and was so rewarded by it. Jack Black, who seemed to appear in everything a few years ago - usually of dodgy quality - was excellent in this. The idea of turning kids onto rock music really worked and it helped that they could already play instruments. My wife enjoyed it in spite of herself and warmed to the humour and the execution of the plot. Joan Cusack was good in her part as the principal of the school and the kids in Black's class were great too without being the 'cutesy' school kids that usually appear in this kind of film.",8,2,7,26 December 2013
Transformers," What?
",I am watching the tail end of Transformers as I type this. I tried it several months ago before turning it off after about 15-20 minutes.Do people actually pay money to see this crap? Inane and witless nonsense. I like SFX/CGI movies on the whole but Michael Bay should never have been allowed to be anywhere near a project like this.As for Shia La whats-is-name he should be working in MacDonalds as he certainly cannot act as witnessed by his appearances in the Indiana Jones movie and this sorry excuse for entertainment. Megan Fox just about delivers her lines form an orange visage but she is by no means the babe I have been led to believe that she is. Jon Voight must need work badly if he is willing to take part in this travesty. From Midnight Cowboy to this- what a trajectory!!,1,0,3,16 July 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Starts well and then......
","I give this 7 because I am beginning to really like Matt Damon's work and I already love Emily Blunt. The premise of this film is superb and intriguing in the first instance and while the viewer is still trying to work out what is going on I would say it is riveting. Even when one becomes aware of the situation it still works really well. Towards the end of the movie the pace slackens and the story becomes rather hackneyed, leading to a damp squib of an ending. Maybe hanging the whole story on the romance rather than the political angle should have been switched around and it really could have gone somewhere. Overall I can say it held my interest and I enjoyed it, but it could have been so much better with tighter writing and direction and a different emphasis. Blunt and Damon were as good as they could be given the script and they had chemistry, on which the story depended.",7,0,2,25 February 2012
Everest," Disappointing
","No characters to really latch on to apart from Jason Clarke's and admittedly I am only halfway through it, it is boring me to tears. All it has managed to do is point out the futility of mountaineering ( especially climbing challenges like Everest). I guess it is something of an obsession for those who do it. The film is well made and has great cinematography but , no pun intended , it leaves me cold. I just cannot wait to the movie to end. A waste of resources and an excellent cast.",6,1,4,9 April 2017
Toy Story," Bona Fide Genius
","What can I say that has not been said about this superb piece of work? Pixar have redefined what animation is all about. The concept, the story, the writing and the voice-overs could hardly be bettered. The toys are real individual characters brought to believable life by the actors who voice them. Special mention for Tom Hanks as you really cannot separate his voice from Woody's character. It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that. Everyone should be made to watch this - it has a lot to say about life and relationships.",10,0,1,23 July 2016
Men in Black," Real fun
",Watched this film again on DVD this afternoon and was so impressed with it as a fun movie. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a great team and put everything into it to make it a proper entertaining movie. The special effects are terrific and the supporting cast are great too. Vincent D'onofrio is particularly good as a human redneck taken over by an alien. He is scary and simultaneously funny too. The concept is terrific and while I am aware it comes from a comic source it works extremely well. It as surprised me that the producers have not sought to continue the movies as an ongoing series much like the Bond movies or the Superhero movies which are so prevalent these days. Diminishing returns maybe or a lack of good scripts -who knows?,9,1,4,12 November 2017
Alice in Wonderland," I hate it.
",Visually interesting but an appalling take on the story. The best thing about it is Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp but even they are held in check by the writing. This really is not Alice in Wonderland though - the title is just a peg on which to hang some sort of misdirected fantasy. If Burton wanted Gwynneth Paltrow why did he not employ her instead of a lookalike? One of the single most disappointing films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Lots of anticipation dashed on the rocks of Burton's vision. Sweeney Todd led me to believe that Tim could pull this one off but far from it. Crispin Glover's character had no business being in this and most of the cameo voices were wasted. Can no-one manage to make this story into a film successfully? Jonathan Miller came close but there is still a cigar to award to the first person to do it properly. Perhaps Pixar will tackle it one day - if anyone can do it they can.,2,3,6,19 February 2011
Avatar," Too derivative
",The visuals were stolen from the work of Roger Dean who designed many album covers for bands in the seventies -significantly Yes whose Close to the Edge album and Fragile's covers are the template for the floating islands in this movie. The story is a B-movie fifties western set in space. The script is lousy - who in their right mind would use Unobtainium for a rare mineral that the earth people want? Maybe in a draft script but not in the finished article.A shedload of money was spent on this film and while it looks great and is fairly visually appealing nothing makes up for a dull story and script and unsatisfactory acting. That said the actors did as well as they could with material given that it must have all been done against green screens. I am rewatching this film again with few expectations - the visual plagiarism of Dean's work seems even more blatant and inexcusable. The script is full of clichés as are the characters but on bluray there is no denying the quality of the image. The blatant theft of Roger Dean's artwork still makes my blood boil and to read that a court action brought by Mr Dean failed beggars belief. I find it hard to believe that 4 more movies are made out of this material as there was only just about enough of a plot for this first one and that was stolen form a 50's B western.,4,2,5,28 June 2014
La La Land," Seriously?
","Is this the film some (misguided)people have raved about? I am 15 minutes into it and absolutely hate it. Now I love musical movies and treasure the likes of West Side Story, My Fair Lady even The Rocky Horror Picture Show but La La Land seems to miss on every point. The musical numbers are irrelevant as well as being awful and unmemorable. The opening sequence is as far removed from a tasty introduction to the genre as it is possible to be. I find it hard to believe that anyone could have enjoyed this crap. The characters are uninteresting and I am unable to care what happens to them.I cannot see myself making it much further because I am never going to get that wasted time back. The one plus I can give it is the colour and lighting but that is all it has to offer.",2,3,8,30 June 2017
Some Like It Hot," Could hardly be better.
","Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond were genius screenwriters and Wilder was a terrific director. SLIH is a sublime movie. I have loved it from the first time I saw it. I introduced my daughter to it when she was about 11 and she loves it too. Every time I came into the house she was watching our VHS copy. At first irritated, I would end up watching it yet again and laughing like a drain at it. it just never loses its appeal and I find something else about the movie that maybe I had not noticed before. Lemmon and Curtis are at the top of their game and in spite of MM's difficult ways they turn in Oscar worthy performances, especially TC who had the most scenes with Marilyn. I hear there has been talk of remaking Some Like It Hot - that would be sacrilege - it could not be made any better than it was.",10,1,1,20 July 2014
Titanic," Appalling- even Leo could not save it.
","While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the 'heartthrob' title attributed to him. Conversely and inexplicably it boosted Kate's career beyond any explanation.",4,6,10,22 December 2016
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Tedious
","Have to admit I am not a huge Harry Potter fan but I do enjoy SFX movies when they are well done. I have only read the first book and it left me with no desire to read another. All that said, I kind of enjoyed the first few movies but it has taken me a long time to get around to this one. The effects were terrific for the most part,but the way the film was put together was less than appealing. It seemed to be an endless parade of scenes which had little relevance to the scene that went before and certainly did not drive the story forward. It was very boring and tedious, made worse by Emma Watson's amateurish performance, breathlessly declaiming almost every line - could Mike Newell get nothing better out of her? Daniel Radcliffe was very good in it -I still think he was a great choice for Harry as he has to carry the movies -if he did not work, neither would the films. Rupert Grint was treading water, both in his performance and script-wise. There was not much for him to do. Brendan Gleeson was a great addition to the cast. On a more positive note I was suddenly hooked by the final half hour. The graveyard scene, when Ralph Fiennes finally entered the action, was superb. For a film of this length to only come to life in the final scenes was unforgivable. I hope the remaining films are better than this one.",3,1,2,29 April 2012
12 Years a Slave," Disappointing
","A well made but flawed movie. My main gripe with it is the dialogue. I imagine it is authentic but the problem is that I could only catch about half of what was said. Chiwetel is great as the main character but when one can only follow parts of any conversation it spoils the effect of those parts of the script. It must have been a difficult task for the actors to treat each other so appallingly, even given they were only acting. It really is not a film that one can be said to 'enjoy' it is more a question of appreciating it. Steve McQueen took on a difficult and even controversial subject in this film and it was never going to be a blockbuster. It has been honoured more for the subject and the bravery it took to make it than for it's quality.",7,0,0,23 October 2016
There Will Be Blood," A possible epic overcooked
",I am halfway through this movie at present so perhaps it is not fair to judge it yet. Nevertheless that is what I am doing while watching. This is the bones of a great movie - it has been well shot and has great atmosphere but it is so ponderous in its execution that it leaves one anxious and wanting to shout 'Get on with it!!' The director has held onto scenes and shots far too long to entertain the viewer - it becomes ultimately boring. Daniel Day-Lewis overplays most of the time and underplays the rest of the time. His voice reminds me of Jack Palance -it is rather mannered and does not really convince. Only Mr Palance can do it. 2 hours and 40 minutes is more than is needed to tell this tale and the soundtrack just does not suit the movie at all for the most part. I want to see how it pans out so I may hold on until the end but the fact that I am writing this while watching it tells me I am losing interest.,3,5,9,9 March 2016
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Not Stoker's
","This was definitely not Bram Stokers Dracula!! That said it was an enjoyable take on the Dracula story which, quite frankly, has been done to death. Gary Oldman is/was simply the best characterisation of the Count I have ever seen. I doubt he will ever be bettered. In all his incarnations young or old he really nails it. it is so true to the representation in the book as I remember it (if not the actual description it is the total feel of the character). it has been 30-40 years since I last read it and it scared the bejesus out of me! I really did not enjoy Hopkins in this - far too mannered and hammy for me. Keanu Reeves is pretty awful, mainly because of his accent. I think he was cast for box office reasons. I hated Sadie Frost when I first saw this and still don't love her after having seen it about 4 times, but she does grow on you - I guess she was doing as she was told by Coppola. Costumes were superb and the sets were great. There are a lot of flaws in the way the story was told and I would like to see a better, more coherent cut with as much of Gary Oldman as possible - he really should have won an Oscar for his towering performance in my opinion. The way he delivers his line 'The children of the night....' is worth the cost of admission alone.",7,1,4,31 August 2012
"Hail, Caesar!"," Appallingly awful
","No-one in this mess of a movie comes out of it with any credit except maybe Arlen. He was not only convincing as a not-so-dumb cowboy star he rather appealed to the viewer on screen. The Coen brothers have made some wonderful films but this, most definitely was not one of them. I daresay they were able to attract the stars that appeared purely on their reputation as filmmakers. Judging by the people in the movie I think it may have been made well before it's actual release date as I think it must have taken forever to form the dull script into some kind of releasable order. Clooney ought to rethink what he gets involved in or his career is likely to go into steep decline. It is boring, preachy, confusing and I found it difficult to believe that good actors were content to take part in this nonsense. Making a movie that people are going to enjoy and take away something with them is no easy feat and it proves that even the best writers and directors can make stinkers sometimes.",3,2,5,22 September 2016
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Flawed but great.
","I have to say I have reservations about this film, largely to do with casting but overall I thought it was terrific. I think the casting of James Nesbitt and Billy Connolly in particular just took a lot away for me - Connolly is so much himself it brought one back to reality instead of being steeped in the world of MiddleEarth. Luke Evans was great as Bard and I could see him cast as Thorin too. Richard Arming had a difficult task to be a hero and villain at the same time. I loved the battle scenes, inventive as ever and in spite of taking up most of the film I never grew tired of seeing it. Lots of people have been irritated by Legolas' seeming disregard for physics but if you remember the LOTR films he displays an uncanny knack for seemingly impossible physical feats. If you study the elves army's movement you will find that fascinatingly odd too - they are elves for Chrissakes! Peter Jackson has given a suite of films based on Tolkien's work which I do not believe anyone else could have done. I applaud him.",8,8,14,10 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Does not add up
","I am watching this movie right now and can only think how stupid Lucas was to make the trilogy in the way he made it. The movies look much more futuristic than the three original films which were supposed to take place later. There are creatures and robots we have never seen before and one question I would like to know is why are droids like Grievous (who has a cough!!?) wearing clothes like cloaks? Lucas should have at least kept the look of the older movies - just because he could have more spectacular effects he was so wrong to employ them. Far too much green screen has been used and it has affected the actors' performances. They are not convinced they are really there and neither are we. Hayden Christensen would make a tree look animated and even Ewan Macgregor always sounds as though he would rather be somewhere else. Too much money has been lavished on these newer films and they are nowhere near as good as the first three. its 2013 and I am watching this again on TV. My original thoughts have not really changed. Ewan seems to be in another sort of movie from the way he delivers his lines. the screen is filled to bursting with action in the fight scenes but that does not make them as good as the original movies action sequences. Just because they could does not mean that they should have gone well over the top with creatures ,droids, robots and spaceships.",4,1,8,21 October 2012
The Lion King," Meh!
","I have always loved Disney animations with a few exceptions and this, I am afraid, is one of them. The actual animation is pretty good, though I hate the anthropomorphism of the animals and the dreadful americanisation of the young lions' voices.Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons are the best things in it. The most dreadful thing about the film, though, is the music. Horrible 'modern' pop does not work for me and Elton John /Tim Rice combo was a bad choice for writers. I am watching it now as I type and like it even less than I thought I did. I guess an old curmudgeon like me was never the target audience for this as I am aware of it's huge success with most of the cinema-going public. I hanker for the days of Pinocchio, Snow White and Bambi - they never seemed to be as cynical as this movie. They were made with love and commitment rather than an exercise in multimedia marketing.",2,1,7,17 July 2016
Sherlock Holmes," Up to date but true to legend
","I first came across Sherlock Holmes when my Dad brought me a present from a trip he had been on.It was a Complete Sherlock Holmes Volume. I was about 10 and very disappointed. About a year later I was bored so I tried reading it. I was absolutely entranced and gripped by the stories and read them again and again. I have seen a few movies and tried the TV series but although not awful they were not satisfying. I had no great hopes of Guy Ritchie's entry into this particular ring. An American playing Holmes? Even if it were Robert Downey Jr (whom I love as an actor)? Well, dear readers, it works superbly. Downey and Law are a charismatic pairing and the movie is just about as good as it could be. Such energy is brought to the story , it carries the viewer along at a tremendous pace. The whole depiction of Victorian London looks and feels right and is as much of a character as any of the actors. The supporting actors themselves are more than up to the job too - Mark Strong's villain is imposing, dark and menacing - but then he is a fantastic actor and he too would have made for an interesting Holmes, in my opinion. Eddie Marsan always gives good value and his Lestrade fitted right in. I would have liked to have seen the pace slowed a little from time to time so I could take a breath, but that is nitpicking. An excellent venture and I and my wife look forward to the next one. A wonderful achievement by all.",9,1,2,10 April 2010
Wonder Woman," Appallingly disappointing!
","I have seen some reviews of this film which bear no resemblance to what I have just watched. Those good reviews made me really want to see it . I thought it started quite promisingly and I did not hate Gal Gadot's performance so much as others have. However, the script is very poor and the plot based around WW1 is pathetic. After 45 minutes I gave in, switched off and deleted it. Millions of dollars have been wasted to make this crass travesty and if I ha paid money to see it at the cinema I would be demanding a refund.",1,3,11,10 March 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Ambition failed
","I am perhaps 30 minutes into this movie - somewhat early to be making a judgement but I am going to anyway. This is actually the second attempt to watch it with no expectations. I am still totally confused as none of the first scenes make any sense at all. It has the ambition of taking the subject material completely seriously which is a huge mistake. The main characters are superheroes - they cannot be taken as seriously as this film is trying to do. The very premise is flawed as Batman could not take on Superman and be successful. Batman is after all only a man with thousands of cool toys - Superman is, well, Superman - super strong, superfast, invulnerable (kryptonite aside), completely unbeatable. Snyder has made the whole thing far too dark for it to be really enjoyable - too many flaws in the premise. All that said the film looks great and has a quality for that . Affleck and Cavill acquit themselves as well as is possible but I can never see Am Adams as Lois Lane she is far too lightweight. Jesse Eisenberg is not the Lex Luthor we all know, he is much too young for a starter and he seems to inhabit a different sort of film - a lighter touch than this film requires. I always understood that he was supposed to be a contemporary of Superman. A very disappointing, mess of a movie. It has had lots of money thrown at it but that is just not enough.",5,0,0,24 July 2016
Ben-Hur," Deserves respect for its achievement.
","Yes its a long movie, probably too long for the MTV generation.Yes its dated (its almost 50 years old). BUT it has brought to the screen a huge story and told it superbly. The SFX are primitive by todays standards but still stir the heart. The chariot race will never be bettered no matter what can be done by computer - it is simply the most exciting live-action sequence ever to be filmed. Stephen Boyd is the greatest of great screen villains and he should have won an Oscar as best actor rather than Heston. Heston is great in this film though, much better than his later more wooden performances. Jack Hawkins was a wonderful actor and was never better.The whole thing has music that is the finest movie score ever. The melancholy scenes wrench tears from the hardest of hearts. I saw this at the cinema on countless occasions as a child, a teenager , a young adult and middle-age on TV and each time ,as I grew older, I derived different areas of pleasure from it. but every time I weep buckets. I am aware that some people hate Ben-Hur, but why really escapes me. It is film making at its best. The idea of someone remaking this intrigues me though and the idea of perhaps Guy Pearce as Judah and Russell Crowe as Messalah directed by Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott has a fascination for me. I remove one point from the score of 10 out of 10 only for the fact that as Joe E. Brown says at the end of Some Like It Hot, 'Nobody's Perfect!!'",10,0,2,1 May 2006
Casino Royale," Wow!!
","My wife hates Bond movies, and since Connery left I can take or leave them - I enjoy them as bubble-gum that is I never want to re-chew them. But Casino Royale is awesome. Craig has reinvented the character and swept away all preconceptions. We have waited a long time before finally viewing it and it totally lived up to the hype.I have always rated Craig as a fine actor and that is what he brings to it, as well as a genuine physical presence. My wife loved it (and him) to bits. The fight scenes were convincing and brutal and the whole thing played out like a modern thriller. The story harked back to the original book (which I read when it was new!!)which worked well for me .Cannot wait for the next one!!!",9,1,8,22 May 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," HUGE disappointment
","I am watching this as I type and can only say it is an abomination. When I was a teacher I read this excellent Roald Dahl story to my class of 8 year olds every year and it was loved by all of them, so much so that I sometimes had to read it twice to the same class within the year. My beef(s) with this film are as follows 1. This movie bore little resemblance to the book apart from the names of the characters. 2. The whole thing was americanised. 3. This was sit-com material. 4. It was boring as hell. Things I liked were as few and far between I enjoyed the sound of Clooney's voice and Meryl's too, but they should have been given a much better script. I like quirky and have no real problems with creative adaptations but this was poor on almost every level. Wes Anderson should be ashamed of himself.",1,23,53,28 December 2010
Thor: The Dark World," Halfway through and struggling
",Halfway through this debacle and struggling to keep my attention from wandering. Oh wait I'm writing this so attention well and truly on a holiday.The only thing good about it is Tom Hiddlestone. He says his lines as though he means them and understands them.The film is unengaging and I find the actors unconvincing. I saw the first movie and it was just OK. In this one however I find Idris Elba wasted and unbelievable as a character. Even Anthony Hopkins seemed to have just turned up for the cash. Loads of special effects and CGI especially in the Asgard scenes but if the story is not involving then they count for nothing. The female friend of Jane - can't remember her name- seems to have wandered in from some teen movie and is as irritating as hell! I just do not care about anyone in this movie at all. As someone else pointed out it looks as if it were put together by a committee!,2,4,7,31 August 2014
300," Surprisingly good
","My wife and I watched this with a cynical eye, fully expecting a video game writ large. While there was an element of that we were both surprised how involved we became in the story and action. My wife said(after the first battle) 'Its going to get tedious now!' But she was hooked from beginning to end as the director cleverly sidestepped that trap. The film looks superb and the acting is pretty good. Butler as the king makes up for the lacklustre performance in Phantom of the Opera and is convincingly macho. I understand the cast spent a while beefing up for their half-naked roles.It is occasionally quite erotic in scenes involving Butler and the beautiful Headley (as well as homo-erotic). The battle sequences are beautifully staged and while bloody, are not gratuitously gory. Kudos to all involved in this. I am watching 'The 300 Spartans (1962)' on TV this afternoon. I saw it as a kid and thought it was great. It will be fascinating to see the treatments side by side almost 50 years apart!!",8,5,11,24 March 2007
The Great Escape," How many times can one see it?
","The Great Escape is a great film. The main problem with it is that in the UK it has been shown on TV probably twice a year at least since it's first TV showing - in fact it seems like more. When it is on I, for one, usually try to avoid it but if I do catch 5 minutes then I am hooked all over again! The cast is wonderful, a mixture of real stars and character actors. Although it is a long film the pacing is superb and the viewer's attention is held throughout. My favourite characters are played by James Garner, Charles Bronson, James Coburn,Richard Attenborough and James Donald. Steve McQueen plays Hiltz the cooler king in his usual laconic, comic style but I find it annoying considering American POWs did not make such a huge contribution to escapes like these. It was great to see so many actors from The Magnificent Seven (another awesome favourite of mine) back on screen and directed again by John Sturges - he knew what he was doing in casting.",8,1,5,7 May 2017
Moon," Worth waiting for.
","It has taken me a long time to get to see this movie and it was well worth the wait. Duncan Jones has crafted a great sci-fi film with a miniscule budget. Avatar schmavatar! DJ is every bit his creative father's son. I believe he can and will do great things within the movie business. A film like this, as good as this, could not have been made without a great lead and Sam Rockwell is terrific in this piece. He holds the whole thing together with a bravura turn. He is ably supported in this by the presence of Kevin Spacey (in voice only) as GERTY his computer assistant and protector. At first the premise is a little confusing but slowly everything drops into place and becomes clear. Jones directed his movie with assurance and no sign that he is a newcomer. I look forward to seeing further movies by an exciting new director.",9,2,8,12 December 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a huge disappointment.
",Two of my favourite screen stars in Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron have really disappointed me in being involved in this film. I loved the earlier Mad Max movies and was so looking forward to seeing this. It is beautifully filmed and the design is awesome but ultimately has nothing of substance about it. The first hour or so is almost all action which after the first 10 minutes start to bore the viewer no matter how stylishly it has been staged. Though there is little dialogue what there is is difficult to understand as everyone seems to be shouting as loud as they can to be heard over the machines. All style and no real substance. How and why on earth would anyone play a guitar in a war chase for goodness sake?,5,7,14,27 February 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Cannot stand it!
",This is the dumbest of dumb movies. There is just nothing in it to recommend it to cinema-goers. Obviously shed-loads of money have been thrown at it but they forgot to make it good. It might have been better had the actors been any good but it is hard to say that anyone did a good job of their contribution to this mindless trash. I suppose the special effects and CGI are fairly well done but that is just not enough to make it entertaining to the viewer. A movie has to involve its audience rather than have them checking their watches every five minutes. I think I lost interest in it before the title of the movie appeared on the screen and it just got worse. I am really astonished that the target audience (12-22?) is willing to put up with this - better sci-fi movies have been made with a fraction of the budget and a lot less effort. Perhaps they do so well with these movies because their audience manages to still have hope over their experience. So sad to witness actors of the calibre of Malkovich getting involved in this crap.,1,1,4,8 May 2017
