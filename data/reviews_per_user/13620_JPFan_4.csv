Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It could've been better...
","I could say I am a Star Wars fan, stopping at the movies, and I was really looking forward to The Phantom Menace, but I have to say I was disappointed in the acting area. Don't get me wrong, I  still loved the movie, but I think that George Lucas should have spent more time on the cast instead of the special effects. Probably the character with the MOST character would have to be Watto the Hut. Although I enjoyed the fight scene and the pod race scene immensely! ... and I still think that everyone should see it, even if you're not a Star Wars fan, because it's a really fun movie.",Null,0,1,30 August 1999
A Hard Day's Night," Very Funny
","I'm not a Beatles fan, I wasn't even alive when they broke up, but I think that this movie was a hoot and a half! The music was great too. It was especially funny to have Paul's 'grandfather' in the mix, making a mockery of the situation and pawning off the band. If you're in for a good laugh, this is the movie to watch!",Null,0,0,30 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Wow
","The moment I saw the preview for this movie, I instantly wanted to see it. What a relief to have a INTELLIGENT horror movie! Haley Joel Osment was spectacular, he portrayed a troubled, frightened kid perfectly! And Bruce Willis was amazing as a determined psychiatrist. But I think the best part of all was the ending! It was SO unexpected! Everyone should see this movie!",Null,0,0,30 August 1999
Jurassic Park," A Movie Beyond Cool
","I must say that Jurassic Park is the coolest movie I've ever seen. It has suspense, horror, adventure, betrayal (Nedry, sort of), and a great cast! I never get tired of seeing this movie (or reading the book.) And for all of you who haven't seen it, you must be from a different planet! No, seriously, it is a must see! TEN STARS AND BEYOND!",10,2,3,29 August 1999
