Hereditary," imo, A bit overrated
","As a fan of this horror genre(cult), i think it wasn't anything out of the box.
Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne was exceptionally good in their characters.Cultic horror is the new trend now and many movies and series are following this trend. 
You might find it fascinating if you're new to this but it failed to entice me anyway.",5,0,1,25 August 2018
Captain Marvel," You can skip this one for sure
","There's not much to look for in the character,It's the same superhero movie with a different character. The story was bland and predictable. I had to shrug my tediousness off a few times to focus on the film. Only the soundrack has some goosebump moments which can be availed for free , you don't have to beat your wallet for a monotone journey of a superhero once again .If you think Engame will not be legible without seeing this movie, You'll be wrong..This movie doesn't offer anything subjective to help the bouying infiniy war series which will conclude with the impending Endgame movie.",2,19,33,8 March 2019
Bird Box," Four stars for this movie......... No no no.... That's too much!
","The story makes no sense, the dialogues make no sense, the characters make no sense.
This movie is a competition to all the previous debacles from Netflix.",2,24,55,19 December 2018
Hugo," A movie about the foundation of movies
","Watched this movie when it was released in 2011 and watching this now after 7 long years.Many masterpieces were released in between,yet this holds the susceptibility to compete against all the movies that released till date.Visually engrossing, Stellar performance and a touching storyline, it's all there to make you sit through this enchanting journey of a revolutionary invention.",9,0,0,28 October 2018
