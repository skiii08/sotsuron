The Blair Witch Project," Not what I hoped.
","Well the hype machine strikes again. After waiting and waiting to see the movie I finally went got the chance today to go see the really really not scary and not as good as everybody says Blair Witch Project. If you think this movie is really that scary then never come to one of my family reunions cause you'd have a heart attack.It had some scary parts. Well only one really. The ending had a couple of tense moments but that was about it. It was a good movie, I'll see it again in the future but don't go in the theater thinking it's going to be the best horror movie ever because it doesn't even come close. It's more like a 2 hour long version of the Real World with some spooky noises thrown in.I've read reviews by people where they said stuff like how it was so scary and all and how everybody in the theater was shocked into silence and when the movie was over everybody walked out of the theater talking about how scary it was. When I walked out I heard NOTHING like that. All I kept hearing was stuff like....'That wasn't what I thought it would be''Was that it??''It was all right.''That wasn't really scary at all.''It was OK.'And the really terrible one....'I liked the Haunting better.'I'm not saying it was really bad or anything, it was good, but not much better than the rest of the 90's horror movies. It didn't live up to the hype but I didn't think it could. I think the hype hurt the movie more than anything. I mean the way the promotion tried to trick people into thinking it was real just confused people really. And then when they found out it was all just a big hoax it doesn't really seem all that impressive.",Null,0,1,31 July 1999
