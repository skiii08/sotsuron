"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Marathon's are long, tiring, and require lots of effort, unfortunately that's just what Run Fat Boy Run translates to.
","Simon Pegg plays Dennis, a slightly overweight, live alone security guard at a women's lingerie store. Years ago Dennis left the pregnant love of his life Libby at the altar for fear of commitment, not the most original idea but a start nonetheless. Dennis sort of waffles around his life somehow hoping to that in the long run he'll win back Libby and his son. Libby is now dating Whit, a rich American man who is successful and extremely fit. Realizing that chance may be slipping away Simon attempts to prove to Libby that he can change by running the charity marathon that's Whit's entered. Thus ensues the hilarious comedy that is about to unfold as Dennis and his band of funny and goofy friends help him get in shape to Run! Yay! Now in real life I bet a marathon is a extremely difficult task to train for but in a film this can all be solved by a montage. The fact that the main obstacle for Dennis is running is fundamentally why the film is so boring. Running, jogging, walking with a strut is not something we go to the movies to see, especially when the main antagonist is not a competing runner but merely finishing the race itself. In something like Rocky, Rocky is put up against a the towering, championed, best heavy weight fighter in the world. An opponent that is not only intimidating but also clear and photographable. A marathon is none of this and at the end of the film this creates a problem that is apparent when the film has to break some of its own rules by adding an imaginary obstacle. Now I don't want to ruing what this obstacle is just in case there are some of you bursting to see more Simon Pegg but this trick in the end of the film is something films do when they an idea was not properly fleshed out. They realize the climax of the film is not set up to be quite as exciting as it should be and they have to 'add flash backs of the previous hardships' to reiterate and add to main obstacle, which is simply running more. In terms of comedy it's fairly lukewarm, there's one gem I thought was funny that involves a blister but other than that I didn't find myself laughing much. The dialogue is not really all that sharp and actors are given a lot of leash to work with. In the small instances Simon Pegg is quite a good actor, I do think he has a lot of talent but he works much better when he's the normal one and everything around him is crazy, like in Shawn of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. The cinematography is mediocre but has a lot of color, especially orange. The color choice I find sort of strange. Why did this film need such vibrant and uneven colors? Overall this is fairly forgettable and almost a bad film. Taking a jog would be a much better use of your time. On a completely random and uplifting note: OH my Godz India de Beaufort is so Hot!! she plays the Indian landlord's daughter.... smokin hot.....",4,0,1,16 April 2011
Source Code," Source Code is a more convoluted, faster paced Ground Hogs Day [1993] with guns and a ticking time bomb
","Source Code is a more convoluted, faster paced Ground Hogs Day [1993] with guns and a ticking time bomb. Although not that well made Source Code is a reminder that audiences prefer complex story lines, even if they aren't completely coherent.Source Code stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot who is trapped in some sort of machine simulator. The beginning of the film starts with Stevens waking up on a train in a body that is not his own. He's sitting across from Christina Warren played by Michelle Monaghan, a female companion who he will learn later on has a small crush on him, or at least who she thinks Sean Fentress. Stevens lives 8 minutes of Fentress's life trying to gather himself when a bomb suddenly explodes killing everyone on the train. Stevens awakens in a metal dome disoriented and locked into a harness. Without knowing who or where he is an image and voice appear when he is contacted by Luit Goodwin played by Vera Farmiga. Goodwin tells Stevens that he must identify the bomber of the train so that they can prevent another terrorist attack. Steven's doesn't quite understand what's going on with his last memories being aboard a helicopter in Afghanistan. Before too many of Stevens' questions are answered he is to told to try again and abruptly plugged back into the source code. This process continues over and over until bit by bit is revealed what the source code is. Apparently source code allows a certain someone to be plugged into the consciousness of another certain someone and live out an alternate reality, something involving string theory and such. The rules are that he only he can only live out the last 8 minutes of that someone's life because that's how long the 'flash' lasts when someone dies. Also, whatever he does in that reality will not affect any other reality. So Gyllenhaal is plugged into the source code relentlessly by his military commanders over and over until he finds the bomber. Over the course of his multiple reenactments Stevens narrows down the bomber and develops a relationship with Ms. Warren and Luit. Goodwin. Gyllenhall and Monaghan are good but nothing spectacular. Jeffrey Wright plays the nerdy mastermind quite well. He's cruel, discordant and tunnel minded; just what you'd expect from a scientist who's spent his whole life dedicated to his pet project. But it is Vera Farmiga who really shines in her role as the intermediate officer between the enslaved Steven's and the heartless scientist. In every scene Framiga battles with the two conflicting personas of her character. The female empathic side trying to soothe and care for Stevens as he's used as a cog in the high tech military defense machine; and also the military stratagician (stratagician is not a word???) who must convince Stevens to finish the mission while withholding the painful truth of Stevens' condition. The music in Source Code is a little pretentious and is abnormally noticeable. Its special effects are not the greatest with explosions and slow motion looking like they had been done by a sub par video game company. However it's not just the special effects, nor its mediocre cinematography but also Source Code's erratic pacing and editing for my undistinguished rating. The scenes don't flow well together and you feel just as pushed around as Gyllenhaal's character as you bolt back and forth between scenes. This feeling may have been deliberate on director Duncan Jone's part but watching the movie you feel like you've been riding the old bumpy wooden roller coaster you'd find at the boardwalk. At the end of the film you're constantly teased with false endings. As soon as you think it's going to end, they tag on and extra scene which tangles the plot even further. During the last 20 minutes they start abandoning the rules of source code and begin cramming in new content. It's like they shot multiple endings of the film and instead of choosing one, they decided to put them all in. Source Code is an intriguing film with a lot of complexities and philosophical metaphysics involved which I think is the reason for its success at the box office and among critics. As we know from Inception and The Matrix audiences today are really drawn to these alternate reality movies. However Source Code is not particularly well constructed and i'll be re- watching Ground Hog's Day numerous times before I even think about re-watching Source Code.",6,1,2,15 April 2011
Closer," Yay for Talking Heads!
","This is not a movie, it's more like a whole bunch of acting scenes put together with big name Actors. The film starts off with Natalie Portman getting hit by a car and Jude Law falling for her. But then out of nowhere he falls for Julia Roberts, in like one scene! Then Clive Owen gets in the mix and falls for Julia Roberts also. Then there's a whole bunch of break ups and re-uniting and sex between the four characters. However there's no visual sex, they just talk about the sex. The film starts off very slowly until the 40min mark when the first break happens. All this film has going for it is the dialogue. Bad editing, bad transition between scenes, bad cinematography. It's just four big actors yelling, seducing, and crying at each other for the whole movie. Without the good acting this film would be a 10%, luckily it spent 35 million dollars on actors to barely save it.",4,2,5,16 April 2011
Tangled," Tangled may not quite be on par with the Disney classics of late 80s/90s but there's plenty of magic in Rapunzel's hair for most believers.
","Once upon a time there lived a selfish woman named Gothel who found a flower which returned her youth. She kept it a secret and told no one its location. When princess Rapunzel was still in the womb her mother became very sick. In order to save the queen and Rapunzel a search was called to find the magical flower. The magical flower was found and Rapunzel was saved but Gothel had lost her fountain of youth. The flower had transfered all its magic to Rapunzel's hair which could heal wounds and reverse aging. In order to regain her fountain of youth Gothel kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own. Gothel keeps her locked away in a tower and tells Rapunzel never to leave. She also never cuts Rapunzel's hair, for when it is cut it loses its powers. On Rapunzel's 18th birthday Rapunzel requests to leave her tower and go see the lights that have been appearing in the sky annual on her birthday. When Gothel refuses Rapunzel blackmails a thief named Flynn to be her guide and protector on a journey to the lights. Flynn begrudgingly agrees and the two start off on adventure with Gothel, henchmen and the royal guards all trying to stop them. The animation is Tangled is good and the characters are well rounded if a little stereotypical. Rapunzel is pretty much the same girl you've seen in most children's film nowadays. She's beautiful, insecure at times but also fairly courageous. Equipped with a frying pan to defend herself Rapunzel also uses her long hair to great effect, using it as rope swinging from cliff to cliff and tying up bad guys. Flynn is the charming thief who learns there's more to life than image and wealth and Gothel is a pretty good evil step mother with a few shortcomings. The jokes in Tangled are great, with characters making fun of the many of the exaggerated elements of fairy tales and the adventure is quiet charming. The songs are good but not classic and the side characters are fun, consisting of a chameleon and a horse that acts more like a dog. However Tangled falls short in the last third of the film. It's not that the end of the film is bad in anyway but it's just not amazing or terribly clever. It might just be that audiences have gotten so inundated with fairy tales that they know the endings to most movies. The evil step mother, without any special powers of her own, is not a quiet as scary as let's say Ursula from The Little Mermaid. The only thing that Gothel can do is scheme and wield a dagger. Her schemes are good but Gothel just doesn't have enough of a screen presence to make the film scary, which those old Disney films had. The ending ties up a little too cleanly, at least for me. Also the horse Maximus which in the beginning wants nothing more than to apprehend Flynn switches sides rather dramatically which was a bit unbelievable. Tangled is a bunch of fun and it's the closest Disney has gotten to bringing back their golden age of animation.Who this film is not for:-People who never liked the old Disney movies: Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin etc.",7,1,3,16 May 2011
The Machinist," A great performance by Bale but a film you'll probably need to see twice to get everything
","A psychological drama in which Christian Bale works as a machinist with very heavy and dangerous machines. He suffers insomnia and hasn't been able to sleep for the past year. He has a relationship with a hooker who he has slowly become more and more attached to. There is an accident at the start of the movie in which a co worker is maimed because of Christian Bales negligence. This sets off the mystery in which Christian Bale tries to figure out who the mysterious character is who distracted him at work and also who keeps leaving him mysterious notes in his apartment. This is probably the best performance I've seen from Christian Bale so far and for that you should definitely watch this film. It was quite difficult to figure out the ending so as a mystery film it definitely succeeded. However there just feels like something is off to this film. It might be that none of the other performances from the other characters really shined. Also the music at times was a bit overwhelming and was probably too much of a distraction. A lot of the film felt eerie but not in the ways in which it should have. Also some of the mystery in the film leaves you quite puzzled and you'd probably have to watch it at least twice to put everything together. Also the production value felt very low budget, making the world slightly unbelievable. Splitting the main characters interest between two female characters also was a bit disconcerting. At the end of the film you find out why it happens but it leaves you feeling a bit cheated. It's a great story and Christian Bale is superb but there are just a couple things holding it back from rising above a 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,16 April 2011
No Strings Attached," This film is bad Bad bad! RomCom at its lowest denominator, neither funny nor tearjerking.
","This film is bad Bad bad! RomCom at its lowest denominator, neither funny nor tearjerking. I'm am so angry that at how much money this film made but hardly surprised. Synopsis: This film stars Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher and I'm not even gonna use their character names because you know the audience and producers don't care. Ashton and Natalie meet as teens at a summer camp and Kutcher is immediately attracted. They meet again ten years later at a party and then Natalie is kinda attracted because Kutcher let her use him as an excuse to get back at Natalie's mom...I guess?? Then they meet again five years later and she is attracted to him more? Kutcher then is told that his old girlfriend is bonking his dad and has been for a couple of months. Because of this trauma Kutcher wakes up in Portman's apartment and that morning they have sex. Which I don't understand because the night before he acted like a drunken fool swinging his wang around in her face. I mean come on! What MIT med student would tolerate that? OK sure he is 'Ashton Kutcher' but still! The sex is so good, even though it didn't seem that good in the scene, that they decide to become 'sex buddies'. Natalie Portman is a super Commitafobe and is the driving force that keeps them apart. But eventually blah blah blah you know the rest of the film. Review: OK this film is terribly written, actually...I take that back. It's not that it badly written it's that it hits all the formulaic RomCom plot points. I guess its predicability is what makes it so annoying. You've seen this movie before and you've seen it done better. Examples of the terrible writing with clichéd dialogue: 'you always do this, you always find something wrong with everyone who likes you' 'please say something' 'I'm not letting you go' None of the other side characters are remotely interesting. Every single one of them falls flat. Also the girl who plays the sister of Natalie Portman, they look nothing alike. Not that I have anything against Olivia Thirlby, she was good in the Wackness. Portman and Kutcher's chemistry is unnatural and lukewarm at best. On another note, Natalie Portman totally owns Ashton Kutcher in this film. She out acts him in almost every scene. Plus she looks smokin gorgeous and Kutcher body is all flabby. I mean come on Ashton I know you're tall and your genes have passed down a ridiculously gorgeous face, but you gotta try a little buddy. If you're a guy do not see this movie. Unfortunately if you're a not so smart teenage girl, this movie is probably like crack to you and you've probably already popped this movie into your DVD player by the time you finish this review. If only this movie were in 3D...oh wait they're already remaking this film 'Friends w/ Benefits'....*sigh",3,9,11,15 April 2011
Taken," You better Respect Liam Neeson's threats, cuz he's a comin!
","Okay...1st of all, this is an Action movie, no ifs ands or buts. So given that, you have to ask: Is the action awesome, are the plot holes bearable, are the bad guys bad enough and is the good guy kick-ass enough. The answer to most of these questions is YES! Liam Neeson plays an ex-cia/super spy, who's sacrificed his family for his career. After retiring all he wants to do is be with his daughter who has just turned 17. She however wants to travel Europe. Coincidently of course, his daughter gets kidnapped by human traffickers the first day which sets Neeson on a gun busting daughter hunt all over Paris. Some people might think this film is a bit too racist but I think it evens out the blame of human trafficking evenly among Westerners and non-westerners. The soft side of the film is a bit cheesy but doesn't go to the point where it makes the film unbearable, thankfully. This film is badass! If you don't like action films then don't watch it, but as far as action films go, this is definitely one of the best in awhile. I think Die Hard 4 (Live Free or Die Hard) is very neck and neck with this film, so if you liked that movie you'll probably like this one. Except there's not really explosions in Taken but there's definitely plenty of bullet holes. Side Note: I feel bad Famke Janssen has to do these roles where she's the broken/cranky/snarky woman in a bad marriage. Seems like that's her niche referring to The Wackness",7,0,0,16 April 2011
Limitless," Limitless' structure may be a bit atypical, but its journey is extremely entertaining.
","Limitless' structure may be a bit atypical, but its journey is extremely entertaining. Bradley Cooper plays Eddie, a broke and struggling writer who spends his days staring at a computer screen without accomplishing a single written word. After being dumped by the love of his life Lindy, played by Abby Cornish for basically being a loser, Eddie runs into his Ex-Brother in law Vernon dressed in some very expensive looking designer clothes.The two decide to catch up at a bar where Vernon, feeling sorry for Eddie decides to give him a hit of the newest drug he's been peddling, NZT. NZT is apparently a drug soon to be released on the market that lets your brain work at a super human level. On NZT your deductive faculties surpass that of Sherlock Holmes and your amped learning curve allows you to learn a language simply by listening. With nothing to lose Eddie pops the pill and in one day he is able to seduce his land lord's wife and brilliantly finish a draft to his book. After experiencing life on NZT Eddie immediately comes begging for more but before he can reach some sort of deal with Vernon Eddie finds that Vernon has been put outta the picture.Searching Vernon's apartment he finds a stash of NZT and within days transforms himself into the smartest and most charismatic man on the planet. With these new powers Eddie decides he can the change entire world but needs money in order to do it. So he takes a loan with an very unscrupulous Russian loan shark and starts playing the stock market. Eddie does so well on the market that he entices the eyes one of the most powerful business men in the world, Carl Van Loon, played by Robert De Niro. The rest of the movie is a thrilling adventure with numerous character all trying extract something from Cooper, whether it's his skills on the market or his access to NZT. Cooper also has to deal with some of the territory that comes with a drug habit, including dependency and side effects. Limitless uses some very nice special effects to show the effects of NZT by playing with lens and color. When he's not on NZT the film is sucked of its color and the world becomes noticeably dimmer than the golden fast tracked life of 'NZT Eddie'. The sound design is also splendidly done as while on NZT the film focuses on singular sounds like the rotating of a bicycle wheel. The plot moves extremely fast with new characters and problems appearing one after another. This breakneck speed is fun to watch, but on the other hand, if you don't keep up you're going to be asking your friends how does 'that' connects to 'this'. The film doesn't coddle you with character dialogue blatantly explaining every connection. Nor does it give you much room to breathe and connect every single dot, most people will have to do that after the film is finished. I watched the film twice by happenstance and thoroughly enjoyed Limitless just as much if not more the 2nd go around.Bradley Cooper is a up and coming super star and in this film you not only see that he has range but that your eyes are glued to his every move. Andrew Howard plays a really good Russian bad guy and was quiet fun to watch, even if his role leans a little stereotypical. Abbie Cornish was also fairly good. De Niro played a very good upscale businessman but I felt was under utilized. Carl Van Loon is supposed to be an intimidating veteran of the game whose experience puts him at a level capable of threatening Eddie, but he never really lives up to that role. *Filmmakers Note - When introducing a character such as De Niro that is supposed to be 'the man who owns half on New York' don't have the first shot we see of him be a wide shot of him walking up stairs. Filmmaking 101, use low angles to give characters power, use high angless to lower power. All in all this film is a blast. Every person who's ever felt lazy and wanted to be a better version of himself - motivated, charismatic, and intelligent will love this movie. For people who've gotten there the hard way, their mindset might take issue with this film. Who this film is not for: -Neuroscientists who cringe at the saying 'we only use 10% of our brains' who also can't get beyond the sci-finess and exaggeration of the premise (it can get a little ridiculous) -Extremely moralistic people who believe there are no short cuts in this world and that if you take drugs you don't deserve anything.",9,0,1,17 April 2011
Thor," Chris Hemsworth may be mighty as a god, but his film is merely mortal.
","Thor is the Marvel comic book adaptation of Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Thor played by Chris Hemsworth is the son of Odin, King of the realm Asgard. We are introduced to the golden world of Asgard during a ceremony in which Odin, played by Anthony Hopkins, is about to pass the throne to Thor. Unfortunately some frost giants from the realm Jotunheim ruin event by trying to steal a powerful magic artifact, an artifact that was once theirs but was lost in a long and bloody war with the Asgardians. When the thievery is thwarted Thor goes into a rage demanding payback for the insolent frost giants. Thor request permission from his father to assault the frost giant's home realm. When Odin refuses Thor and his band of warrior friends leave for Jotunheim in secret. Equipped with his mighty hammer Mjolnir, which gives Thor super speed, strength, the ability to fly, and control over lighting and wind, Thor goes on a smashing spree in the ice world. Without heeding the words of his younger brother Loki, played Tom Hiddlestone, and with little regard for his friends Thor breaks the long truce between Asgard and Jotunheim. Angered by Thor's arrogance and disrespect Odin strips Thor of his powers and sends him to the realm of Earth. Thor lands in New Mexico where the Astrologist Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman meets Thor by accidentally hitting him with her car. From here on it's a 'fish out of water' story with Thor learning humility by living as a mortal. All the while back in Asgard, Thor's brother Loki plots to take power for himself. Thor is competently made and for the most part you'll be enjoying the ride, but after it's over you'll most likely dive straight back into your busy life without giving Thor another thought. Thor is not the cinematic master piece that is The Dark Knight and it's no Iron Man 1. The reason being is that Thor's character development is at best, awkward. At first he's arrogant wanting nothing more that to bash some big frosty bodies. The next he falls in love with a scientist who basically all she does is drive him places and feed him. Thor's highs and lows are too extreme to build much an emotional connection to the audience. However, Chris Hemsworth does have a magnetic aura and there's no doubt we'll be seeing much more of him in the future. Throughout the film Chris pulls off both bravado and comedy. Hopkins plays a great king and Hiddlestone can definitely act. The acting all around is superb but with one minor exception. You wouldn't think that this weak spot would come from a 2011 Oscar winner but unfortunately that is the chase in Thor. To her credit Portman did the best with what she had, but what she had can be summed up into a single thought - Fall in love Thor because he talks funny and is a hunk. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two and there conversations are literally: Portman - I don't understand you. Hemsworth - Don't worry it'll be okay. The cinematography is alright but reminds me a bit of the 2009 Star Trek with all its flashy lens flares and overuse of tilted shots. The editing is fairly well done for a movie that has to jump back and forth between Earth and Asgard. The special effects are definitely up to par with Marvel's recent films, I especially liked the how the did the Metal guardian 'Destroyer'. My main visual gripe is with in the first battle scene. It's far too dark and up close to see much, it felt a lot like Batman Begins where you see all this cool action but you just wish the camera would back up 2 feet. All in all Thor is an 'ok' film. It's not a disaster but it just feels like something you should to watch in order to be prepared for the up and coming Avenger film, rather than something to enjoy just for itself. Who this film is not for: -People with high expectations Major gripes: -Battle scenes are in the wrong order. By far the coolest battle scene was the first one and the weakest one was the last one with Loki. In the beginning of the film Thor took on like a hundred frost giants by himself while Loki struggled to take on just two. How are we supposed to take Loki as a serious challenge to Thor at the end when they are so vastly different in power? Loki didn't even use the all power Frost Casket thingy that he used on the bridge guardian!? -In the battle with Loki and Thor, Loki does an illusion Trick and is able to get a free shot in the back of Thor, yet when he does zap Thor with his staff, Thor's not even hurt!? He gets up and smashes his hammer into the ground and Loki flies 20 feet away. -What happened to the Frost Giants saying blood will flow!? Whatever happened to that war? -Natalie Portman and all the human characters were basically shallow vessels for plot. Kate Dennings' character is useless except for making jokes -Odin conveniently having a 'heart attack' when Loki yells at him was a little over the top...way to be original Brangah.... -Thor accepting his fate on earth in like two days was a bit of a stretch. When his friends come to return him to Asgard Thor's like 'it's cool dude, I'm just gonna stay right here, I don't care about being King anymore or seeing my mother or my home land or getting back my powers'.... yeahh..... rightt......",6,2,5,16 May 2011
The Departed," One of the most overrated films of all time, but hey... when you got star power like this film had, who would dare say a bad thing about you?
","*Note: This film has too many big named actors for me to list them according to their roles. There is a such a plethora of characters in this film that they start to blur so I'm only going to refer to character names for ease sake. Actors you may recognize: DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin Synopsis: In the beginning of the film we are introduced through montage and monologue to Frank Costello, the ruthless crime lord of South Boston. He preaches about power, grabbing life by the reigns, and about his general philosophy of the similarities between cops and criminals. Next we are then thrown into another montage of Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan, young cadets going through the police academy. After they graduate we see that Colin is a straight- A, climb the ranks kind of officer but also a double agent working for Frank. Billy on the other hand wants nothing more than to serve. However as a man whose family history is littered with low life criminals he is stuck feeling a bit out of place. Noticeably the black- sheep of his family Billy is given a super secret top mission to fail out the 'Staties' and instead work undercover infiltrating Frank's gang. Billy thinks long and hard about his decision but in the end is persuaded by the father-like figure Captain Queenan.After a 20 minute long intro, the movie begins as the two undercover operatives work on separate sides, doing their best to conceal their dual identities. In doing so there lives begin to morph and derange to the point they don't know if they're more cop or criminal. The story is less to do with a singular event and more to do with when the two will be found out and gutted. There is a thing about some military microchips being sold to the Chinese but that story abruptly ends mid-movie. The driving force of the movie is more about how Colin and Billy must maneuver, bluff, and lie their way out of trouble. Both sides suspect a double agent among their ranks which increases the tension.Madolyn is the on sight psychologist and while getting into a serious relationship with Colin she starts develop an attachment to Billy as their mandatory therapy sessions bring them closer. Review: First of all this movie is almost 3 hours long! No movie should ever be that long unless it contains elements of fantasy or sci-fi. This film has so many stars and characters that instead of choosing who to focus on, Scorsese gives screen time to EVERYONE. It excessively gives moments of emotional development to Frank and Madolyn. Yes, Jack Nicholson plays a cool bad guy but he acts almost like a narrator spitting diatribe after another about cops, foreigners , and every other social intuition on the planet. Why in a movie that has to deal with identity and suspense is there so much 'other stuff' added? There are themes about church, race relations, and about settling in your romantic life. All things that are great and interesting but simply should have been set aside for another movie.The cinematography is nothing special and in fact can be distracting at times, best example is when Billy is being grilled by Wahlberg for his intent on making the force. The camera gets a little movement happy constantly closing in on heads while they talk. Although this film won for best editing I have to forcefully disagree with that recognition. The film is adequately edited but in no way is the editing outstanding. A well edited film has great pace, which this film struggles with in its entirety. It's a stop and go viewing experience with scenes ranging from a couple of seconds to five minutes. Maybe it was purposely done that way to keep the audiences awake, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice flow for attention. Otherwise you're simply shaking the viewer to pay attention instead of enrapturing them. The acting is pretty good but none of the performances other than Wahlberg's is something new. DiCaprio mannerisms continues to be the same in almost everyone movie and only different thing about Matt Damon's performance is his accent. The Departed is an American remake of the Hong Kong trilogy Infernal Affairs, which is probably why I am being harder on this film than usual. Also the premise of dual undercover characters has been done before the action film Face-Off so I don't understand all the buzz this film has gotten. Scorsese was a frontier shattering director and I loved his work in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. However The Departed is far from ground breaking cinema and the clearest example I know of success by name. Who this film is not for: -People who don't like gangster/cop films-People with short attention spans",6,2,2,2 May 2011
Coach Carter," A fairly mediocre film. Can't really say much besides that.
","The film centers around Richmond High school which is underfunded and has only a 50% graduation rate. Coach Carter played by Samuel L Jackson is a former alumni to the school comes in to take over the coaching position in his first season. The film doesn't have a central character but goes with an ensemble cast. The characters include the coach's son, a student drug dealer, a illiterate student, a teen pregnancy and etc etc. I guess what separates this film from a normal basketball film is that Coach is very stringent on the grades his students must keep. Coach Carter sends the message that basketball is not the only trophy worthy of chasing for these at risk teenagers. The acting is alright, no breakthrough performances. Some people have said that Samuel Jackson is great and.... he's okay, but we've seen better in other films. Unless you're in a basketball mood, it's not really worth watching. I has good messages and good lessons to be learned but the drama is just not there. It's not gut wrenching and your not going to be at the edge of your seat to see what happens next. The film plays out very stereotypically with very few surprises. But..... at least it's not terrible :P",5,0,1,16 April 2011
