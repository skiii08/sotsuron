Black Swan," Merci, Aronofsky
","Darren Aronofsky's films have remained among my favorites since I first saw 'Pi' at the 1998 American Film Market, after its much-lauded success at the Sundance Film Festival the same year. What Mr. Aronofsky winds us into with 'Black Swan' is a darkly-mirrored glimpse not only into the world of ballet, but the world of the artist in general. While extreme and demented, Nina's perceptions and experiences, both real and imagined, help the viewer to recognize and understand the triumphs and sacrifices involved in the pursuit of one's creative dignity and self-expression, at moments, at the cost of one's family, health and well-being-- even oneself. Perfection, or its striving, like all other endeavors, comes at a price. One must transform. Merci, Mr. Aronofsky, you've provided us with a legacy devoted to passion, creation and destruction, and the relationship for us with all of these. Were it not for virtues, we would be lost.",9,2,4,12 January 2011
Dead Poets Society," Living Truth in Dead Poets
","Well-acted drama. Very touching. One cannot help but feel empathy for this 'phalanx of pubescence,' struggling at the peak of their youth with self-identity in a world of privilege, pressure and conformity. Their new English teacher, Mr. Keating, is the perfect muse to aid them in exploring a more profound and inquisitive existence. To 'live deliberately.' To love language, and poetry. To discover its meaning in their own lives. And 'Dead Poets Society' illustrates what a great teacher Mr. Keating was. His students learn, and reveal by way of demonstration, one of the most valuable lessons in life: courage, truth, integrity and honor. It stands as the best evidence of Keating's innocence, dedication and ability. Cinematically brilliant, well-conceived.",9,0,0,18 May 2015
Little Miss Sunshine," Ray of Sunshine
","Finally, just when you fear that the studio industry has all but killed the genuine filmmaker, save perhaps David Lynch, you see a ray of light. A bunch of talented people got together and told a simple story involving complex characters with a beginning, a middle and an end. No flash, no gimmicks, no 'look-at-this-new-fangled-cinema technology-and-fancy-camera-work' bogus to cover up lack of substance. No 'it's made to seem just like an indie' fakery. The cast delivers truthful and unforgettable performances, creating a family that is functional in their love and support for one another, no matter how messed up their lives and circumstances may be. Abigail Breslin as Olive wins before she enters the competition, bringing joyful innocence into a world of sorrow. 'Little Miss Sunshine' takes the crown by not competing with the typical two- hour commercialism. There is hope.",10,0,1,22 April 2007
The Exorcist," Exorcise This
","I'm long overdue for my review of The Exorcist. Brilliantly conceived by William Peter Blatty, a graduate of Georgetown University, he knew how to research and write the perfect exorcism motion picture. The acting is superb. The drama unfolds with artistry. The music is poignant, simple, sparse. The effects are proper, never over the top, and convey absolute terror. Two favorite moments occur between Max von Sydow and Jason Miller. A presentation worthy of the novel that inspired it, The Exorcist has been referred to by my colleagues as the scariest movie they've ever seen. I concur. The nature of evil is identified and exposed, hope is offered. The Exorcist continues to speak thus, such fear and wisdom, to the generations.",10,1,1,27 December 2017
