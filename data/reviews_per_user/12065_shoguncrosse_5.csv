It," Go See it- History in the Making - Bill Skarsgard Has a Bright Future!
","Greatest horror movie of the decade! No cheap tricks, no shoddy CGI, no crappy writers, no crappy director and/or producer, and definitely no shoddy amateur actors and actresses. Some of these children in the main roles may be relatively new at acting, especially in a big blockbuster, but none were shoddy or bad at there jobs. In fact, I would go as far as to say I would be highly surprised and disappointed by the Academy and other major film awards groups and ceremonies if these children weren't nominated at all, or win no trophies at all. The praise they most justly deserve for such convincing roles simply cannot go unnoticed or become forgotten. Each young actor and actress fully embodied their respective characters and personalities perfectly on film. The fear you see often within the film is genuine in more cases than not, as was said in previous interviews and news for months; so this also adds that extra layer of reality to the 'realism' of emotions most directors shoot for in order to add those extra dimensions to their films - this was done extensively, and for the majority of the time, it was perpetrated by no one other than the true clown prince himself (watch out Gotham Joker, you have a major new, well, old contender in town!) IT the clown; or better known as, Pennywise. Bill Skarsgard's portrayal of Pennywsie wasn't just fate, as he was the fourth choice to play the role, after the first two declined, and the one who actually did secure it, Will Poulter (I was interested in this actor doing it as well, but glad not!) dropped out early on once Fuknunaga dropped out allowing Skarsgard to gain the opportunity of an audition as Poulter's replacement for the evil otherworldly clown. This was the best thing that possibly could have happened to this film, as not only did Andy Muschietti take the helm, but he was one of the people who auditioned Skarsgard, but also with his great film vision of the movie and love for the original Stephen King novel he wished to create something far closer to the actual tale told. Great news for big King fans! He knew right away that Skarsgard was the man for the gig to become Stephen King's most iconic evil creation after just one interview and audition: A fear and phobia inducing monster of nightmares, creator of torment, and eater of children of Derry; Bill Skarsgard's performance as Pennywise was born. It was something akin to a masterpiece written by a master musician far ahead of his own time, such as Mozart; so far ahead of his time, it took years for others to follow in his footsteps, and his pieces are still relevant today, all the while, his contemporary's learning from the most beautiful concerto performances for hundreds of years to come! Any clown in the history of any actor or actress who has ever played a clown on TV or on film now has been lowered to a status of apprentice compared to this masters performance; truly. And yes, I do include The Joker in this list - both Ledger and Leto - as being relegated to secondary art pieces; shown in auction before the main event piece is introduced with great excitement, applause, and ravenous bids...All great pieces of work, but the last, priceless. Bill Skarsgard's performance just set the bar so high up for the creepiest, craziest, and most psychotic portrayal of a clown that the international space station astronauts may float too, but not because of space's lack of gravity, but because of Pennywise's constantly popping up of balloons...They All Float! The definitive Stephen King Adaptation to date - no doubt! Go SEE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTING!",10,4,10,9 September 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," I rarely write reviews, but...
","I rarely write reviews but this particular movie deserves all the reviews it can get because of three little words: I WANT MORE...And the only way to get more is to show Sony it's worth it..and boy is it well worth it! Loved it from beginning to end, and I see a bright future with this new type of jump off the page comic animation marvelverse..especially if Sony makes more deals with marvel to use xmen, avengers, hulk, and the lot of em! If they're smart they will, this can be a total separate division that will make them billions if seize on this properly",10,1,2,1 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Have No Clue Why Bad Reviews-Great Flick
","Have no idea why in the heck there are any bad reviews here. This movie imo was great, epic in scope, and lays the groundwork for much more 'epicness' in the final film in this trilogy...What Luke does at the end was imo one of the greatest displays of Jedi power ever in ANY star wars movie...The way they explained how the force works and what it is goes along so well with todays current theories on energy etc so it made it so much more believable to me than anyother explanation (like episodes 1,2,3 lol that was dumb) I honestly cant think of anything that makes this movie deserve a bad rating or flack from fans. The CGI was great, acting great, plot was good (maybe not great but good enough to deserve higher ratings than wut many are giving it) and that ending...WOW imo! lol Cant get over that ending part with Luke lol..Amazing! 8/10..Not perfect, not 10 worthy, but def atleast 8 worthy",8,1,3,7 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Best Marvel Flick to Date
","Being its own universe away from the comics (as has always been) I went into this already knowing to expect some things I've known and loved since childhood reading comics, as well as surprising things that were and are new to the MCU. Blew me away to say the least. I got the nostalgia feeling mixed with the new action packed and new spins on characters feelings :). Nothing I didn't like about this movie to be honest so rated a perfect 10. Graphics were amazing, acting was great, it was hilarious at moments, action-packed throughout, and had me at the edge of my seat for the duration. I think this is all a movie should do and it achieved it.",10,61,113,6 May 2017
Joker," Best performance in last decade or so
","Joaquin Phoenix performance here is the best performance of the decade. He most certainly tly deserves an oscar for this. And then when you read some of the improv scenes such as the refrigerator scene or the dancing in the bathroom scene you realize even more how truly great he is in this film. 10 out of 10, my only issue with this film, and why I give it 10 instead of friggin 11 or 12 out of 10 lol, is it should have been a little longer and it should have had him as joker in full makeup doing bigger crimes. In short, they should have gone even bigger in scope with it. Heres hoping he makes a return ;)",10,3,5,24 October 2019
