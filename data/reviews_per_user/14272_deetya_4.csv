Source Code," Bad, mad (Black) scientist & good heroic soldier
","So how come the bad guy is actually the civilian, Black scientist? And the heroic person, the one who doesn't follow orders, is a military person. Jake Gyllenhaal is great, and soulful ^_^. Michelle Monaghan is very cute. It makes sense that the audience/ studio/ whoever demanded that the characters get their happy ending. Jeffrey Wright was wonderful as the contemptible scientist (was this movie funded by Republicans? All the good guys are military, while the lone scientist is the real bad guy of the movie.) He had all this wonderful little acts that shows the audience just what a contemptible person his character is. The premise of this whole movie is a breakthrough in science, so why make the scientist the bad guy? Good movie, except for the anti science angle thing.",7,1,5,29 September 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Epic movie.
","This is how a Star Wars film should be; an independent free-standing movie and not just a copy/ re shoot/ of older Star Wars movie(s). This movie is obviously a 'fan- service' movie, but it is able to stand on its own enough to be a regular, non-Star Wars movie. As war/ combat action-adventure movie, the pace is very quick, with nary a breath of respite in-between scene and location changes. Things happen so quickly it is easy to miss the details. For example, on Jedha, Cassian tells Jyn that his contact went missing. His contact isn't missing, Cassian kills him in a previous scene when escaping some Storm Troopers. There are a few sour notes. The use of CGI for Tarkin and young Princess Leia, for example, is absurd and pretentious. Why? It would've been better if they had real life, flesh and blood actors portraying Tarkin and the Princess. Do the filmmakers think audiences are so stupid that they have to be spoon fed a character that looks exactly like Tarkin or Leia? Or did they do it just because they could? That's an Empire-type arrogance, right there. Another sour note is Diego Luna's performance. He didn't quite gel to the character of a tough, vicious, hard-bitten, cynical, warrior. All in all, this is a good first step in reviving the franchise. Instead of retreading the old Skywalker story, this movie begins to open up the Star Wars universe to a broader feature film world, not just comic books and novelizations",9,3,7,15 November 2017
Mr. Nobody," Wow. Simply wow.
","This is just a fancy-shmancy, artsy-fartsy film... and I love it! :-) Maybe because it has the gorgeous Diane Kruger in it... yea, that's probably the only reason why. Did I mention she's gorgeous? Or maybe it's because of the young love thing. 'I was 15 and I was in love.' Ahh, yes, I remember when I was 15... sort of... I think... I was 15 once, wasn't I? Or maybe it is the 'choice' thing. Have you ever thought back on your life and decided that there was one moment, one choice, which made you the person you are? If you had chosen differently, then you wouldn't be living where you are now, living the live you're living now, be the person that you are now.Have you ever made that decision? Maybe it wasn't just one decision, but a few decisions? Or maybe it was the decision you didn't take; either because you refused to make a decision, or because you weren't allowed to make that decision; you were too young, events just happened too fast.Oh, man, what a trip this movie was. All that choices made and not made and un-made.Wow, what a movie. Simply... wow.Oh, and Diane Kruger is gorgeous.:-)",10,6,12,20 September 2010
Black Hawk Down," Could've been a great movie, but ends up a regular propaganda movie
","I like war movies. One of my favorite is 'A Bridge Too Far.' This movie was intense, well shot, well directed. It could've been somebody! :-) However, like most films 'based on real events' it descended into fantasy-land rather than staying close to reality.The first half of the movie was great. It steadily build tension as we saw the Somali victims, the 'evil' gunmen depriving the refugees of their food, the operation to capture Aidid, up to the battle itself.Unfortunately, that's when the film became a fairy tale.The part of film where the Delta team single-handedly took out a technical, garotted people etc, were total fantasy. The movie without that fairy-tale scene, would actually be more intense, more harrowing, more truthful, and more realistic.There were also other demeaning touches, like implying that the Pakistani Army was so lazy/ incompetent/ whatever, that it took them so long to prepare their vehicles. Well, duh, they probably were not advised of the operation by the Americans, so of course they were unprepared. And would you let soldiers from another country just borrow your armored vehicles? Puh-leeze.The filmmakers should've had more confidence in the American people and tell as much of the truth as possible, without needing to embellish the truth with fairy tales and such.",7,0,4,6 February 2014
