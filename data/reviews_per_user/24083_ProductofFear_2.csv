Your Name.," Breathtaking!
","This is some of the most beautiful animation you will ever see in a film. The character development is extremely strong with you rooting the leads on throughout this magnificently told story. A+ for creative plot execution and an excellent pick for all audiences, not just for those who love anime!",9,1,1,23 November 2019
The Lion King," What do y'all want?
","I have enjoyed Disney's live action remakes of the classics because they have been beautifully presented and have satisfied my desire for childhood nostalgia. For me, that is what I expect and want out of a Disney live action remake and The Lion King certainly did not disappoint.
I was stunned throughout the film at the beautiful landscapes and intricate attention to detail with the animals that showed a lifelike quality that I had never before seen. Some have complained that the animals did not exhibit emotion but to me, having eye rolls, tears, or laughter on such a realistic adaptation of the animals would have cheapened the work done to create such authenticity.
The opening sequence was such a technical achievement that left me feeling amazed at all the work that went into this film. JD McCary and Shahadi Writght Joseph were excellent as young Nala and Simba not only as voice actors but exhibited such talent as musicians. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen gave me exactly what I wanted and had me laughing throughout, the humor worked and they worked very well together.
My one complaint was the lack of quality with regard to the 'Be Prepared' sequence. I can tell singing is not the forte of the great Mr. Ejiofor but it could have acted as more powerful transition into the darkness had it been more true to what we saw in 1994. With that being said why are people upset when Disney takes liberties in making changes to the originals? I have also heard that people complain about this remake because it is too close to the original. Let's not overthink it people, these films are beautiful and remind me of my childhood. They do not take anything away from the originals and I happily paid my $8 to reward Disney for such quality work!",8,0,6,20 July 2019
