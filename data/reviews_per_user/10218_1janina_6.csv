Walk the Line," Definitely will be nominated for an Academy Award
",I was never a Johnny Cash Fan...but this movie was superb. His life story was very moving. Joachim and Reece did a phenomenal job in acting and singing throughout the movie. They were both so convinceable that you started to believe they were the really Johnny and June. I was simply in awe at how fabulous their voices were...You'd really think it was Johnny Cash singing. At one point in the movie I even closed my eyes and it sounded totally like Johnny Cash but it was Joachim doing his own singing. The movie flowed so well that near the end I wanted it to continue. Never a dull moment in the story.A totally awesome movie...A must see even if you were never a Johnny Cash fan like me. It has Oscars written all over it....from the story line to the actors. Definitely two big thumbs up and highly recommended!,10,0,1,28 November 2005
Seabiscuit," The Best Movie I've Seen in a Looooong time
",Being the it was a true story was even more breathtaking. The actors/actresses did a wonderful job depicting the story. I was totally enthralled throughout the movie...there wasn't a dull moment.  It truly represented the way the events really happened. The movie audience clapped at the end of the movie.  That tells it all!! I suggest for everyone to see this movie.  Take your families and see history as it really happened.,10,0,0,4 August 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Don't waste your money
","The worst movie I've seen in a long time. The story line was stupid...the acting awful and the filming actually made some people nauseous...The lady in front on me had to leave twice because the filming was so amateur...it was like watching the Blair Witch Project.From the first minute of watching the movie I knew I should have left and gone to another one, but I thought I'd give it a chance andboy was I sorry when it ended.",1,26,64,30 March 2004
Mystic River," Very moving....
",This movie was great...it was dark feeling at times...but true to life. Shows exactly what happens when you when things happen that are out of your control. It kept my interest throughout the show and really touched my heart with the hardships and sadness that the characters had to deal with.This movie is definitely worth seeing.,8,0,0,9 November 2003
Love Actually," Wow...Wow...Superb Movie
","Right from the start the movie I got totally enthralled by it. It was funny, sad, moving and totally worth seeing. It's definitely a keeper. If you are a romantic sould...this ones for you. Can't wait to watch it again!",10,0,1,9 November 2003
Iron Man," Great Movie
","I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. It was not your usual superhero movie. I'm actually hoping for a sequel to this movie. I would recommend it to everyone!The story is captivating...the actors believable. I loved Gwenyth Paltrow in her role as Pepper, who is Mr Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) personal assistant. There is chemistry between them...you know it and hope the story develops around it...so that's why there needs to be a sequel.The action and story line have a lot of unexpected twists and turns. The kids next to us in the theater were totally enthralled and commented on how much better this movie was then 'Indiana Jones'...so I have to go see for myself now...But to be honest I think it'll be hard to beat this movie.",9,1,2,26 May 2008
