Mission: Impossible III," Mission Improbable
",The IMF has the best technologies and some of the greatest personnel in the world.Somebody just wanted to extend his screen time because . . .1. Why did they need to use a hand-held make-up compact camera to take images of Davian? They had satellites able to get images car license plates from earth orbit. Can't they have telephoto cameras? 2. Said Scientologist had a scene in which he had Davian say words from a card in order to create the voice copy. Don't they have phone taps? Rifle mikes? Cellphone taps? plant a mike in his room? 3. Wouldn't it have been easier to keep the kidnappee sedated for the entire trip to Headquarters. Why let him wake up then threaten to throw him off the plane. An excuse to let Davian know Ethan's name? 4. They used tape to tie him up. No handcuffs? Ethan was tied up better.The action was good but the screenplay logic was awful.,3,1,3,11 May 2006
