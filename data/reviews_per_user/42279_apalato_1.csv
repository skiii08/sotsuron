The Avengers," Amazing!!!!!
","I had the extreme pleasure of seeing this movie last weekend at a Facebook fan screening in Hollywood. I waited in line for 2 hrs to see this movie and was greeted by the surprise appearance of Writer/Director Josh Whedon, stars Chris 'Thor' Hemsworh Tom 'Loki' Hiddleston, Clark 'Agent Phil Coulson', Cobie 'Maria Hill Smulders and Producer Kevin Feige and let me just say ... I would gladly stand in line for another 2 hrs to see it again...The Avengers in one word was 'AMAZING' Josh Whedon and his cast and crew knocked this movie right out of the ball park and into a whole new cinematic universe !!! The action, humor and story were spot on. The action and characters were ripped right out of the pages and put right onto the screen., everything you love about the comics is there and then some. It was immediately obvious that this movie was made by the fans, for the fans... It dozen't matter if your a fan of comics or cartoons, everyone will find something to like about this movie. Just be prepared for a roller-coaster ride and a a great time at the movies!I have to say when I first heard Mr. Whedon was attached to direct, as a Buffy and Angel fan I was excited., But he succeeded all my expectations and then some. Anyone says you just can't write a good script with this many actors and give them all their own story arc should attend the Josh Whedon school of screen-writing... Mr. Whedon did a phenomenal job of handling each character providing every actor (big and small) their time to shine.The Avengers have assembled... and I can't wait to see them again an again !!!",10,12,25,18 April 2012
