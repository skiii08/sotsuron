It," No Wonder Stephen King Liked This Treatment of his Classic Story!
","The setting is Derry, Maine in Oct. 1988 to Sept. 1989 instead of Oct. 1957-1958 and I think it suits the production! George Denbrough (Jackson Robert Scott)is a normal, run-the-mill 6-year-old boy with a older stuttering brother whom he idolizes named Bill (Jaeden Lieberher). Bill makes Georgie a boat out of a piece of paper and he sealed it with wax for George. Bill can't go out in the rain because he's ill. Georgie gives him a hug for the boat and runs out in the rain. The boat ends up sailing into the sewer and Georgie meets a creature one doesn't expect to see in a sewer. The creature is a clown who has Georgie's boat in his hands. Bill Skarsgard plays the clown Pennywise who introduces himself to Georgie and they have small talk. When the boy reaches for his boat, the clown turns monstrous and rips the poor kid's arm off! He drags Georgie down into the sewer while an old lady watches from her house along with her cat. After Georgie's disappearance, the Denbrough family is basically destroyed. Bill and Georgie's parents ignore their remaining son and the grief gets too much for them! Bill isn't the only one with problems in his life. He and six other kids have to deal with less than stellar parents and horrible school bullies in their lives. The group really can't be called a band which is what a group of boys is called because of the lone girl of the group named Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis). Beverly is tormented by a group of snobby girls led by Gretta (Megan Charpentier). They all think Beverly is a slut and is trash. Everyone thinks poor Beverly is those things, too! They throw water on her and torment her. The five other boys are overweight, bookish, Derry history buff Ben Hanscom (Jeremey Ray Taylor), aspiring comedian Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) an orphaned home-schooled African-American boy who lost his parents in a fire. He is the only black boy in town and is a target of racism. Eddie Kasprak (Jack Dylan Grazer) is a frail boy with psychosomatic asthma and other health problems his smothering mother aka smother has made worse in her only child. Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) is the only non-Christian of the group who is studying like mad for his upcoming Bar Mitzvah but it's not good enough for his rabbi father! The six boys and one girl have to deal with Pennywise the Dancing Clown who uses their fears against them and a group of bullies led by the son of the police chief. Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) is the mean, evil bully who torments the group he calls the Losers Club with Belch Huggins (Jake Sim), Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague) and Victor Criss (Logan Thompson) as his lackeys. Pennywise is on the loose though and the clown goes after the Losers and the Bowers' Gang as well. Patrick is eaten by the dead, floating kids. Pennywise knows what kids fear and he uses these phobias against them! Bill is tormented by Georgie, a diseased leper comes after Eddie, Beverly is scared of her leach of a father, Stan is terrified of a picture of an ugly woman in his dad's office, Mike is scared of the fire that killed his parents, and Richie hates clowns. Bill Skarsgard makes this Pennywise his own and the results are terrifying! Tim Curry in the 1990 TV movie 'IT' also scared the hell out of viewers and both actors are artists in their own right! All the kids are awesome and you emphasize with the Losers and hate the bullies! I do hope Chapter 2 lives up to Chapter 1 and the grown-up versions of the Losers are great too! I think Sophia Lillis is right about Jessica Chastain playing older Beverly because they do look like each other. I do have hopes for Bill Hader as older Richie because Richie grows up to be a comedian and they look like each other! Maybe Tim Curry can make an appearance in Chapter 2 or the actors who were in the 90's version can have cameos too! Sad to say Jonathan Brandis who was young Bill in the TV version and John Ritter who was older Ben won't be in Chapter 2 because both have died. Last of all: I recommend this version of IT highly and hopefully Chapter 2 lives up to my recommendation as well! I am glad Bill Skarsgard is coming back as Pennywise! I did see pictures of the Skarsgard clan and all are very attractive. I think if the remade 'Clueless,' Cher would say a guy is a Skarsgard if he's very good- looking instead of a Baldwin. I do hope Bill wins an Academy Award next year and I wait with baited breath for Chapter 2!",10,4,13,10 September 2017
Hereditary," Family Secrets Destroy a Family Already on the Edge
","Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is a wife and mother with a stable, much older husband, Steve (Gabriel Bryne) a pot smoking son in his mid teens named Peter (Alex Wolff) and a 13 year old withdrawn, unusual daughter named Charlie (Milly Shapiro). Annie and Charlie are both artists. Annie creates miniatures as a living and she even creates mini worlds of events in her life. Charlie, who barely talks and vocalizes like a chicken, makes little figurines out of discarded materials such as old bottles and even a dead bird's head. With the exception of a black dress to her maternal grandmother's funeral, Charlie wears a large orange hoodie and jeans.
The family trauma comes to a head when Annie's mother, Leigh dies. Annie had an unhappy home life as a child. Her father starved himself to death when she was a baby. Her brother, Charles whom Charlie was named after, hung himself in their mother's room when he was nephew Peter's age. His suicide note mentioned his mother trying to put people inside of him. His niece, Charlie was very close to her grandmother and is devastated by the loss. She clucks like a chicken, draws strange pictures in her notebook, and eats chocolate bars with a blank look on her face. Her parents have to make sure the chocolate has no nuts because of her nut allergy. Even though Annie loves Charlie and tries to help her emotionally after the funeral, Charlie wants the grandmother whom she had the unhealthy relationship with (i.e, Leigh breast fed Charlie and wanted her to be a boy).
More tragedy follows this poor family when Peter and Charlie go to a party. Charlie doesn't want to be there. Peter wants to smoke his really good weed and suggests Charlie have a piece of chocolate cake that is being offered. Unbeknownst to Peter and Charlie, there is an abhorrent amount of chopped nuts in the cake. Charlie eats the cake and has an immediate allergic reaction. Peter drives her like a bat out of hell to the emergency room. On the way, he swerved out of the way of a dead deer and hits a pole. Charlie dies when her head hits the pole and she is decapitated.
The family is paralyzed over Charlie's unnatural death. Annie is in a rage at Peter and Steve the stable one just wants things to go back to normal. That can't happen, though. Pre and post Charlie's death, Annie discovers her mom was involved in a cult that worshipped Paiman, a demon from hell who is interested in the arts and knowledge. Leigh was also artistic like her daughter and granddaughter. She embroidered welcome mats with the demon symbol on them. These mats also have the names of Annie and Charles on them and are beautiful!
Into all of this comes a kindly woman Annie met at a grief support meeting named Joan (Ann Dowd). Joan lost her son and little grandson in a drowning. She and Annie perform a seance and they communicate with Joan's grandson. Annie tries to communicate that way with Charlie but things don't go well! The fact the seance fails is an understatement! Joan is not what she seems to be! She was friends with Leigh and in the cult. The cult wants a male blood relative of Leigh's to house Paiman. Charlie's body was used to house the demon, but he didn't want a female body. They tried with Charles but he killed himself and Steve was out because he wasn't a blood relative.
In the end, the cult burns Steve up. They haul Leigh's headless body to the tree house Charlie spends time in and Annie cuts off her own head. Charlie's head is retrieved from the highway and placed on a wooden figure in the tree house. Peter throws himself out of window and is possessed by Paiman like his own mother was. He goes to the tree house and the naked cult members along with Joan crown him as Paiman.
This movie was quite a powerhouse! All the performers were excellent! Toni, Ann and Gabriel were all great and I thought the younger performers were awesome too! Milly Shapiro is so unlike the withdrawn Charlie in RL, it's unbelievable! Alex Wolff was also wonderful as Peter and I felt bad for him when he cried the way a little kid would! I recommend this movie highly! One thing I wasn't expecting was Judy Collins' lovely song 'Both Sides Now' at the end!",10,1,3,8 January 2019
Orphan," This movie is about an endocrine (hormone) disorder many people are unfamiliar with
","'Orphan' tells the story of the Coleman family-father Jon (Peter Sarsgaard), mother Kate (Vera Farmiga) and their 2 children, Daniel aka Danny (Jimmy Bennett) who is a preteen and small deaf daughter, Maxine aka Max (Aryana Engineer). Not all is well in the Coleman household, though. Kate had a devastating miscarriage of 3rd child/2nd daughter, Jessica. The baby's remains are planted inside a bunch of white roses in the family greenhouse. This loss, coupled with Kate's alcoholism and Max's near drowning in the backyard lake have devastated this family. Jon and Kate are seeing a therapist Alice (Margo Martindale) to help them with the loss and heal their family. Jon and Kate want to adopt a child because both of them want to move on with their lives and share their love with a child. Both of them go to St. Mariana's Home for Girls to find a new daughter. Immediately, Jon and Kate are charmed by a 9-year-old Estonian orphan named Esther. Jon found Esther in the classroom painting a picture of a sad mother lion who could't find her cubs. Esther painted the cubs in the picture and the lioness was happy at last. Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) says Esther's previous family had died in a house fire. She says Esther is a well-mannered, highly intelligent girl who wears conservative dresses and ribbons around her neck and wrists. The only time Esther gives the nuns trouble is when they try to remove these ribbons. Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther is wonderful! One minute she is sweet and charming, the next minute she is an evil little thing with designs on Jon, her adopted father. Kate begins to see her adopted daughter as a menace and so does Danny. Max and Jon think Esther is wonderful until the girl shows them her dark side. It doesn't help that Kate found pictures of Esther's previous families in the Bible Esther carries around and an inscription inside the cover for the Saarne Institute. Kate does some investigating and discovers the Saarne Institute is a mental hospital. She sends them a photo of Esther via the computer. While the family is in the hospital with Danny after Esther nearly killed him in a tree house fire, Dr. Varva the director of the institute calls Kate. The news he has for her is totally unexpected-Esther is not a 9-year-old girl. She is a thirty-three year old mental patient named Leena Klemmer. Leena suffers from a hormone disorder called hypopituitarism. In other words, her pituitary gland doesn't produce the needed growth hormone and she is stuck inside a child's body. Leena as Esther seduces Jon and he spurns her. Esther runs to her and cries. She removes her child's dentures, makeup, and breast binding to reveal the woman she really is.'Orphan' is a wonderfully suspenseful movie with an evil, but at the same time tragic villainess. Esther can't help that she was born with an endocrine disorder that won't let her achieve the height and endowments of a grown woman. In a way, the viewer feels sorry for people who suffer from endocrine disorders because it is not their fault that they have these disorders. All of the actors in the movie are excellent with special mention paid to Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther/Leena. It is not easy a child actor under the age of 11 to play a little girl and a woman at the same time and Isabelle pulls it off wonderfully!",10,1,2,5 October 2015
Concussion," Will Smith is brilliant and so is Alec Baldwin in this Compelling Drama!
","The movie 'Concussion' opens with former Steelers football player, Iron Mike Lewis (David Morse) talking to a group about his football years. No one, least of all Iron Mike is aware he has a broken brain that will lead to this poor man's downfall. The scene cuts to Mr. Lewis and it is sad indeed! He is homeless, broke, and estranged from his family. Mike is struggling with headaches and forgetfulness. He tries to tell his friend, Justin Strzelczyk who is also a former football player about his problems, but Justin doesn't really understand. Mike visits the team doctor, Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) and is given prescriptions to help him with his condition.The next scene introduces Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) as a compassionate coroner from Nigeria, Africa who is doing an autopsy. Dr. Omalu talks to his cadavers in an understanding way and is very good at his job. Dr. Omalu will figure into Iron Mike's death and he talks to the dead man nicely as well before he cuts into him. Iron Mike's brain seems fine, but Dr. Omalu wants to investigate further because a man of 50-years-old who is healthy would not die unexpectedly unless something happened in that man's life. Dr. Omalu orders a more informative test and this reveals horrible damage to Iron Mike's brain. The medical literature points to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that is a degenerative brain disease from repeated head trauma. CTE leads to dementia, aggression, and depression. Pretty soon, other former football stars are dying of CTE and this includes Justin Strzelczyk. Dr. Omalu along with coroner Cyril Wecht and neurologist Steven DeKosky wants to publish these findings of CTE as a warning to the NFL to take care of brain traumas the players incur during games. This doesn't bode well with the NFL and the group in fact tries to suppress Dr. Omalu's findings. The one thing that gives Dr. Omalu's report credence is the fact a football player named Tom McHale killed himself and in writing said he wanted to donate his brain to CTE research. Will Smith is wonderful as the compassionate, intelligent doctor who wants to help out the athletes so they don't suffer the effects of CTE. Alec Baldwin is great too as the fellow author of the CTE piece and so is the actor who plays the outspoken Cyril Wecht. I think this is one of the best real-life stories out there. In a weird way Dr. Omalu is like a black Erin Brockovich. Like her, he wanted to take on a huge corporation that was letting people get hurt. Unlike her, Dr. Omalu did not talk like a sailor or dress like a street walker! I think Dr. Omalu's research will help the NFL understand they need to do more to help football players past and present to protect their brains!",10,6,13,31 December 2015
The Revenant," Leo DiCaprio Should Win an Academy Award Based on his Stoic Performance Coupled with the Hypothermia and Eating of Raw Venison
","In 'The Revenant' Leonardo DiCaprio is real-life fur trapper guide named Hugh Glass. In the 1830s, Hugh and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) led a group of fur trappers in the forests he knew so well. These men were at a high risk for animal attacks, Indian attacks, and the unpredictable way winter can turn stormy and life threatening. The leader of the fur trappers is John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and he and Hugh do not get along. In fact, John denigrates Hawk because of the boy's half Caucasian/half Indian ancestry. Hugh keeps the peace between them, but it is short lived. Hugh is alone in the woods watching a couple bear cubs whose mother comes along and attacks him. Hugh kills the female bear with his knife after she nearly kills him. The men make a stretcher of sorts for Hugh, but hauling the man around in it in sub-zero weather is making everyone tense.John asks Hugh if he should let him die and with the blinking of his eyes, Hugh agrees to this. Just as John is ready to finish off Hugh, Hawk intervenes and John kills the boy. John and his men dig a hole and put Hugh in it after taking the man's gun. Hugh is barely alive and not ready to throw off the mortal coil. He digs himself out and wants to get revenge on the men who killed his son, took his gun, and left him for dead.The revenant of the story is the wife and mother of Hugh and his son. Huge's wife was killed when the Indian village was attacked. Her ghost aka the revenant guides Hugh along his quest the men who left him for dead. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful as the taciturn, honorable Hugh Glass while Tom Hardy shines as the villainous John Fitzgerald who leaves Hugh for dead. Hugh's near-death visions are touching but at the same time frightening because he sees a nightmare character played by 'Mama' character Javier Botet. The struggle of Hugh Glass is not glossed over for the audience. His determination to live is laid bare for all to see and Leo's expressive face tells all. I do think this is a good movie to watch when it is 90 degrees outside because the cold beauty of winter can make one feel like they are freezing! 'The Revenant' is a bit long, but worth it at the same time!",10,3,6,11 February 2016
The Conjuring 2," Ed and Lorraine Are Back!
","Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his clairvoyant wife, Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are back ghost-busting in this frightening sequel to 'The Conjuring.' Ed and Lorraine find helping out families with their ghostly problems is too much for them and both want to retire after the Amityville haunting. Lorraine rein-acts what happened in the house in her mind and it is frightening to her! She also sees this demonic nun (Bonnie Aarons) in her visions. All the retirement plans change when a priest brings a tape recording to them to listen to. It is a man speaking in a British accent and Ed thinks the man is possibly senile. The priest tells him no. The owner of the voice is an 11-year-old girl named Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) who lives in the burg of Enfield, England in a 2 story house with her mom and siblings in 1977. Her father ran off with a neighbor lady who bore him twins. The Hodgson family consists of Peggy (Frances O'Connor), older sister Margaret (Lauren Esposito), and two little brothers Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley). It has not been an easy time for the family after the man of the house left. Johnny is teased mercilessly by the kids at school because he stutters and Peggy worries how she will support herself and 4 kids. Into all of this Janet and Margaret are hearing noises late at night and the furniture starts to move on its own. Peggy doesn't know what to do about these disturbances and the police who visit her suggest she call the TV station and go on air telling the world what is happening to them. Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney) who challenges the Warrens at every turn, shows Margaret and Janet on his show. Janet starts talking in the deep voice and the lights flash on an off. There are more hauntings with Janet being levitated off the ground and Johnny's zoetrope with the Crooked Man coming alive. The Crooked Man is played by Javier Botet and I think with his body structure and the fact he can move his arms and legs in strange ways due to Marfan Disease makes him a creepy addition to the movie! It is revealed Janet is possessed by a man who died in her house and he reveals his name to be Bill Wilkins. Bill doesn't want to go to heaven or hell and the creepy nun is stopping his spirit from moving on. Another reveal that came as a surprise: Janet caused some of the furniture to move and it was caught on video by Anita Gregory (Franka Potente). Janet has no choice but to confess what she did and the Warrens leave. In the train, Lorraine has a vision of Bill Wilkins and he tells her he can't move on. He is held by a demon and the Warrens have to reveal the entity's name. When they go back to the Hodgson house, the haunting is in full force with no help from Janet and Lorraine realizes she knows the demon's name because during a vision she wrote it in her Bible. She reveals the name just as demon is throwing Janet and Ed out of the window to their deaths. This is great, creepy movie with wonderful performances from Patrick, Vera, and the rest of the cast! Madison Wolfe is also effective as the traumatized Janet who doesn't understand why the haunting is happening and she just wants to be a normal young girl who has a father and who isn't teased at school. This is a worthy sequel to 'The Conjuring'!",10,0,2,23 June 2016
Enchanted," Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey are Great Together, but Clara Who is the Old Lady on the Bus Steals the Show!
","Amy Adams is great as Giselle a princess sent from her fairy tale land to New York by Prince Edward's (James Marsden) evil stepmother (Susan Sarandon). Edward, Giselle, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and the evil queen start out as cartoons but turn into flesh-and- blood characters when they all end up in New York. Joining them is Pip, a cartoon chipmunk who talks clearly in the fairy tale land but squeaks in New York. The singing and dancing Amy Adams and others do is catchy and the dancers are awesome! I laughed at Clara the little old lady on the bus Edward nearly stabs and she says dramatically to Giselle, 'He tried to kill me!'. Susan Sarandon is a scream as Edward's stepmother who wants Giselle out of the picture. The queen is mean to poor Nathaniel who is just trying to help her out and she greets him with, 'Hello, worthless.'. I highly recommend 'Enchanted' and Giselle proves to be a wonderful stepmom to Robert's (Patrick Dempsey) 6-year-old daughter, Morgan (Rachel Covey)!",10,1,1,29 November 2016
Sinister," Part Grrek tragedy and part Gashlycrumb tinies
","The movie 'Sinister' is part Greek tragedy with the Gashlycrumb tinies thrown in for good measure. Ethan Hawke is Ellison Oswalt, a washed up true crime novelist who had fame from 10 years ago with his only masterpiece 'Kentucky Blood.'. Ellison is determined to get his fame back and redeem himself to his British wife, Tracey (Juliette Rylance), young daughter, Ashley and preteen son, Trevor. He moves his family into the Stevenson house where 4 members of the family were killed and the youngest daughter went missing. The Greek tragedy comes about because Ellison won't listen to the Sheriff (portrayed by no- nonsense Fred D. Thompson) and the officer's warnings to Ellison are not listened to. James Ransone is fan-boy Deputy So-and-So and he helps Elllison in research behind the sheriff's back. Ellison finds the Super 8 movies of families including the Stevenson clan being killed in gross, yet creative ways. Ellison sees the figure of Babylonian god Baghuul in the movies and he finds out that Baghuul aka Mr. Boogie is possessing a young child from the family and forcing them to do away with their family. This entity feeds on the souls of these children and he makes them all look ghostly and dead. Ellison and his family pay with their lives for Ellison's refusal to listen to the Sheriff. Ethan Hawke is great as Ellison Oswalt and the other actors play their parts to perfection as well! Clare Foley as Ashley is a wonderful combination of innocence and corruption too!",10,0,1,20 February 2015
The Witch," It Is Safe to Say I Will Avoid all the Black Goats at the Petting Zoo Because of Black Philip!
","The movie 'The Witch' is based on stories about witches and devils that have been circulating for over 400 years or so. The last name free Puritan family of William (Ralph Ineson), wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), daughters Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) Mercy (Ellie Grainger), and sons, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Mercy's twin, Jonas (Lucas Dawson) and infant son Samuel are the main characters in this story.The story takes place in 1630, 10 years after the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts. The family is incredibly zealous even by Puritan standards and this doesn't set well with the community who kicks them out. William is determined his family will not let the woods tear them apart and the farm will be a thriving one. The life of the family literally goes to hell when baby Samuel vanishes while Thomasin is watching him. The crops begin to die and the chickens lay dead eggs and the goat gives blood instead of milk. The one animal on the farm that gives the most grief is Black Philip. The twins claim he talks to them and they also claim Thomasin is a witch. The only real witch in the story is the one who killed Samuel and who seduced Caleb when the older boy went out for food for the family. Caleb comes back naked and delirious. He is in hysterics in bed and this wears out his heart and he dies. Mercy and Jonas don't help matters either when they both collapse on the ground in hysterics as well! In the end, the whole family except for Thomasin is killed. William is gored to death by Black Philip while Katherine is killed by Thomasin in self-defense. Katherine tried to strangle her daughter and Thomasin stopped her. Black Philip is really the devil who set in motion all the bad things that happened to the family. He has Thomasin sign the book he has and leads her to the woods after she strips naked. Thomasin is now apart of the coven of witches in the woods and in a weird way is much happier now. Before everyone made her feel like she was a witch and abnormal because she was a teenage girl struggling with puberty. This was a very interesting, scary movie about how a belief system can turn people against each other. This family forgot about love and acceptance all belief systems should have and the devil was able to get a hold of them. All the characters were excellent with special mention paid to Anya Taylor-Joy as the misunderstood Thomasin! Robert Eggers really did his homework in regards to the language, clothing, and religion of the time and it shows!",10,3,9,25 February 2016
Joker," I Was So Overwhelmed by Joaquin Phoenix's Awesome Performance, I Wanted a Cigarette and I Don't Smoke!
","Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is absolutely great as a man society ignores and when people pay attention to him, they beat the living hell out of him! Arthur is a frustrated wanna be clown-comedian who has a neurological disorder that makes him laugh like crazy. I think the laughs cover the tears he cries. He is on 7 different meds and has to care for his bipolar mother, Penny (Frances Conway). I quote a little from 'Cellophane Man' song from 'Chicago'- people walk by Arthur and look right through him like he isn't there. In a way, I thought of John C. Reilly putting on white pancake in 'Chicago' when Arthur was putting his pancake on. Amos Hart and Arthu Fleck are ignored and mistreated by people and you can see their pain.
All of Arthur's frustrations come to a head when he and a woman are bullied by 3 drunk morons who work for Thomas Wayne, a wealthy man Penny worked for 30 years ago. These fools beat up Arthur on the subway and make fun of the clown costume he wears after he entertains sick kids at the hospital. Arthur shoots them with a gun he accidentally dropped at the hospital. Thomas Wayne is disturbed by the killings and wants to be mayor and clean up Gotham. Penny writes to him constantly about her and Arthur's living situation and writing about Arthur being Thomas's son. If so, the Joker and future Batman aka young Bruce Wayne are brothers.
Unfortunately for Arthur, Thomas tells him he is not his father and Penny was mentally ill and adopted Arthur as a little boy. Her boyfriend abused little Arthur. Arthur smothers his hospitalized mother with a pillow and that is when Arthur dies and he becomes the Joker.
In the middle of all this carnage, Arthur is invited to be on his idol Murray Franklin's (Robert Deniro) talk show only to be humiliated by the man. Murray shows his audience Arthur bombing out at a comedy show on a recording. Murray thinks the young man with the clown makeup will entertain everyone, but Arthur reveals what he did on the subway. He shoots Murray and takes off. There is anarchy on the streets of Gotham and the protesters in clown masks see the Joker as their leader.
This exciting, rather gory movie is really about the Joker with the creation of Batman as an afterthought. Joaquin really stretched his acting ability to the limit and his performance overwhelmed me to the point I wanted to smoke a cigarette to calm down! I called down without smoking but it takes a great actor to overwhelm people with a oerformance!",10,2,3,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Pennywise Better Watch Out! The Now Grown Losers Club Will Kick His Ass!
","When we last left the Losers Club, the six boys and one girl made a blood vow to come back to Derry, Maine to finally destroy the evil, shape-shifting clown, Pennywise. It was late summer 1989 when the vow was made and the children except lone black character Michael Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs as young Mike, Isaiah Mustafa as grown Mike) have left Derry.
The club members are wildly successful except for poor Mike who has stayed in the cursed town and is waiting to see when and if the members will fulfill the oath they made as children. William aka Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell as young Bill, James McAvoy as grown Bill) is a very successful writer who is married to Audra (Jess Wexler). She is an actress who is staring in a movie based on one of Bill's books. Everyone agrees Bill is a good writer but they criticize his book endings. The lone girl, Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis as young Beverly, Jessica Chastain as grown Beverly) is a wonderful clothing designer married to Tom Rogan who abuses her horribly. Bill Hader is Richie Tozier the club comedian who doesn't write his own material. Finn Wolfhard plays young Richie. I think the adult actors really look like the children actors with James Ransone nailing Jack Dylan Grazer's Eddie Kaspbrak mannerisms to a T! Andy Bean has a short, memorable role of Stanley Uris and he channels Wyatt Oleff's mannerisms and hair quite well! I can also see Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben Hanscom growing up to be quite a hunk like Jay Ryan! Last of all, Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is back to his own tricks and this Pennywise is truly terrifying and in a rage!
The catalyst for Mike's contact of his old friends is the hate murder of a gay man named Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) in 2016 at the Derry Carnival. These hateful punks beat up Adrian and his boyfriend Don Haggerty. They throw Adrian in the canal and Pennywise, just waking up and starving after 27 years, takes a bite out of Adrian. As the movie goes on, the flesh of Adrian doesn't satisfy the clown for long. He feeds on a little girl named Victoria who has a birth mark on her face. Pennywise tricks her into thinking he can cure her mark but devours her instead. He also eats a young boy in the fun house in front of Bill.
The Losers all come together in their old town with the exception of Stan who cuts his wrist in the bathtub after Mike's phone call. Pennywise is determined to make the Losers relive their childhood traumas. He even breaks Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) out of Juniper Hills institution to exact revenge. Henry killed his father Butch Bowers as a boy and was committed. The scares come on after another! The spider Pennywise with Stan's boy face is way more scary than the fake looking creature from the almost 30 year old TV movie! Well, to give the TV movie credit, TV has a more limited budget than movies and the producers and directors did their best with what they had. I never really liked Stephen King acting in the movies based on his books, but I thought he was great as the antique store owner who sells Bill the bike Bill had as a boy. Bill missed his beloved Silver and needed it back.
The Losers stick together and finally defeat Pennywise. Eddie is killed by the spider and Richie is heartbroken because he had a crush on Eddie but never told anyone he was gay. This movie did follow the classic TVmovie in some scenes especially with the Chinese restaurant and the special fortune cookies. Pennywise says 'Kiss me, fat boy' to young Ben like TV Pennywise (Tim Curry) said to TV Ben (the late John Ritter). A rain slicker clad Georgie also confronts young Bill and grown Bill and tells both that it's their fault he is dead.
All in all, I was satisfied with this movie and the cast! Both Bills (Hader & Skarsgard) were awesome! It's safe to say that Bill Skarsgard and Tim Curry before him have ruined clowns for everyone! I recommend this movie as a satisfying swan song to this movie!",10,23,45,7 September 2019

Finding Dory," A Very Entertaining, Albeit Education Sequel to 'Finding Nemo.'
","'The Finding Nemo' gang is back with forgetful blue tang fish Dory looking for her parents, Charlie and Jenny. Dory is having flashbacks to her childhood of her parents and these scenes are adorable! Little Dory is very cute with her baby voice and her gigantic eyes! Dory was separated from her parents and 'Finding Nemo' is flash backed to as well with her helping Marlin find his son. This time it is Nemo and Marlin who are helping Dory look for her parents in a California water park. While there, Dory finds her childhood whale friend and a beluga whale who help her out. She also finds a new friend in a rather cranky octopus named Hank who is really a septopus because he has 7 legs instead of 8. I had no idea an octopus has 3 hearts and I am quite sure kids went home with parents and read up on the subject of octopus. This movie teaches a good lesson to kids to never give up and even though Dory is not the brightest fish in the school, she does things her own way and never gives up. Young Nemo asks Marlin, 'What Would Dory Do?' and they do what Dory would. As strange as it sounds, there is a car chase involving the truck transporting the fish with Hank at the helm. I recommend 'Finding Dory' as a worthy sequel to 'Finding Nemo'! The unexpected addition of Sigourney Weaver's voice at the water park was great too!",10,2,20,23 June 2016
Casino," Robert Deniro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci are great, but Martin Scorcese's little Italian mother steals the show from them!
","Ace Rothstein (Robert Deniro) is a lean, mean Jewish American gambling machine put in charge of the Tangiers casino in the Las Vegas desert. Ace knows how to run the Tangiers in the way it should be run and will use hammers and vices on cheaters who want to defraud his casino. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is Ace's hot headed body guard of sorts who will in his own words not let anyone f-word with the Golden Jew. Ginger is Ace's wife who is a drug addicted gambler as well and Ace considers her to be the Queen of the Tangiers because she can bring gamblers in. She has her world in control except for her former pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Even though Ginger is a wife and mother she won't let go of the hold Lester has over her! All performers are excellent in their respective roles, but director Martin Scorcese's little Italian mother Catherine steals the show from these actors! She is so funny as the mother of one of the Mafia guys who lectures her son for dropping f-bombs and rolls her eyes when she can't stop his tirade! Catherine brings much needed comic relief to the movie and I think it's great Martin Scorcese brought his mother into the movie and turned her into a star! 'Casino' is recommended for the performances and Scorcese's mother!",10,1,2,17 August 2016
Easy A," Go forth, my son, you are a man
","Olive Pendergast (Emma Stone) is a precocious, ordinary high school girl who wants to be popular and unintentionally tells her friend Rhiannon she had sex with a college guy named George. It's not true. Olive doesn't want to spend time with Rhiannon and her off- the-wall nudist parents and she invented a college boyfriend and with pressure from Rhi admits she lost her V-card to George. This throws the school in an uproar! The other students believe Olive is putting out but her favorite English teacher (Thomas Hadden Church) doesn't believe it. During the classroom study of the Nathaniel Hawthorne classic 'The Scarlet Letter' Nina a judgmental girl insults Hester Prynne and Olive. Olive calls her a sexual name and gets send to the principal (Malcolm McDowell). She sees Brandon a gay friend who receives detention with Olive and they have to clean the school up as punishment. Brandon hit another student who gave him grief over his sexual preference. He and Olive talk about it. The next day, Brandon visits Olive and suggests they pretend to have sex at popular girl Melanie Bostick's house. Olive agrees to it and she and Brandon yell, scream, jump on the bed, and make other noises to make the crowd gathered outside the door think they have sex.Pretty soon Olive is open for business as the school tramp and only pretending to do sex acts with unpopular boys. She comes on the radar of Nina's Jesus freak friend Marianne (Amanda Bynes) and Marianne wants to throw Olive out of the school for sex acts that are only pretend. Emma Stone is absolutely great as Olive and her eccentric parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are wonderfully understanding and supportive of their daughter. Lisa Kudrow is also great as the school guidance counselor married to Olive's teacher. The actor who was the evil James in 'Twilight' is also very funny as Marianne's dumb as a bag of hammers boyfriend who is secretly seeing the guidance counselor and should be out of high school at the age of 22! This movie is highly recommended for a good laugh and I think Emma Stone's singing voice is very good!",10,0,0,23 May 2017
Green Book," Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali Are Awesome In This Biopic!
","Frank Anthony Vallelonga, Sr (Viggo Mortensen) is the husband of Dolores (Linda Cardelina) and the father of two sons, Nick and Frank, Jr. This man is a bouncer at nightclubs and goes under the nickname of Tony Lip because of his ability to BS. Tony lives in New York with his family in the early 1960s. He is Italian and talks like a sailor and also speaks Italian. The club Tony is a bouncer for closes down for repair and Tony needs a job. A human being with amazing gastric ability like Tony can only earn so much money from hot dog eating contests!
Dr. Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is the polar opposite of Tony. He is not a medical doctor and has doctorates in music and psychology instead. He is also a gifted African-American pianist from the age of 3 and beyond. Dr. Shirley is well-breed, polite and intelligent. Tony is offered a job from Dr. Shirley to act as the man's chauffeur and body guard. He has to drive him through the prejudiced south to gigs. They use the titular Green Book as a guide to motels both men can stay at.
Two men who are poles apart become very good friends in this wonderful biopic! Tony introduces Don to the music of other black musicians like Little Richard and Aretha Franklin. He also shows him how good KFC is. On the other hand, Don teaches Tony how to write lovely letters to his wife and how to be well mannered.
Tony's son wanted to tell everyone about this unlikely friendship and this is a loving portrayal of his late father who was born in 1930 and died in 2013. Dr. Shirley was three years older than Tony and by a strange coincidence, died in the same year. I recommend this movie highly!",10,1,3,12 March 2019
