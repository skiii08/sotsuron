Hereditary," Not 'scary'
","Scariest movie of the year? No way. It's creepy, and pretty well done. But SCARY? Hell, I'm more scared of Stephen Miller's face than I am of this movie. Stuff happens, Toni Colette acts hysterical, supernatural mumbo jumbo occurs, the kid gawks bug-eyed, but 'scary,' no I don't think so.",5,3,7,17 June 2018
In Bruges," Very cool movie
","You see the previews and wonder if it's a piece of crap or something cool. Guess what - the latter. Very interesting dynamics among the characters, even 'Harry' (Fienes) as the crime overlord. Quite funny in spots, quite tragic in others. A whole set of peculiar minor characters, including the 'midget.' The wonderful old world scenery of a medieval city, where anyone can go sight-see the old buildings, up the twisty narrow staircases, UNLESS you're a pack of 'elephants.' You certainly might laugh at times, at others you might almost cry.A real fine mix of everything you want to see in a crime movie. AND!!!, it's set in BRUGES!!!",10,2,5,24 June 2008
I'm Not There," Piece of Sh**t
","I am so glad I didn't buy this dog on the basis of all the hype. It's literally 'unwatchable,' it is SO bad. The director doesn't have a CLUE what he is up to, and disgraces his subject. No matter how true his intentions were, he's clueless. As far as I've seen, he's never done anything ELSE right, either.I live and breathe Bob Dylan as a guiding force of genius in my life. I consider myself very lucky to be alive in this world simultaneously with Bob and his work. I don't know how I'll even bear it when he goes.Not to say there isn't some talent involved. I bought the soundtrack and that kid in one of the 'Bob' roles is really, really good - both as an actor and a singer.But this 'movie' is an insult.",1,20,32,8 May 2008
Shakespeare in Love," The way great movies should be!
","The name 'Tom Stoppard' was enough to bring us to see this film at the first chance we had.  We were not disappointed - this is a great, fine film.  It does justice to Shakespeare, the intelligence of its viewers, and to anyone with a heart for both romance and the tragic realities of life.  There are great moments in which, like Shakespeare, the director and writers move you from tears to hilarity and back again.  Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely and has a tremendous opportunity to display her talent.  A 'must see' film!",10,0,0,1 January 1999
Bridge of Spies," 'It doesn't matter what people think. You know what you did.'
","Spielberg knows what he did, but I have a few thoughts. Let's start with the title - You know, there's only one 'spy' per se, who matters anyway. But it makes it sound like some thriller-diller, eh?Now Tom Hanks - uh, what's with that incredibly furrowed, knit brow all through the story. Makeup Oscar time? Did they borrow it from a Klingon?The woman who plays Donovan's wife? I know she's supposed to be convincingly all 1950s square - but really, heels and full lipstick all the time? Smiling at everything? At least they didn't plug in Jessica Chastain, that would not have been credible opposite Donovan's shlubby character. A performance as flat as one of those pancakes in the big American breakfast he never ate.The youth are not at this movie, they're all out to see the latest vampire/zombie/Tom Cruise dreck. So the boomers out to see an ennobling patriotic drama have lived through all this, including 'duck and cover' and the Missile Crisis. Do those of us who actually were terrorized and traumatized by all that really need pedantic little lessons about the bombs and the sirens, delivered by Donovan's delusional little genius son? I found it insulting.Of course, all the Russians are scene-chewing geeky monsters, sometimes in such close-up we can see the beet-bits in their teeth.Gosh, it was cold in that Cold War! So we have to see everyone blowing and wiping their noses, boogers hanging, in order to get the idea?Exception: Mark Rylance, the only great thing about the movie. I've been watching Rylance in 'Wolf Hall,' and it's very impressive how he can create such a level of charismatic tension by hardly doing anything at all. He's all stillness, posture, little eye movements and gazes, all restrained, all coiled in. Amazing.Back to the thriller at hand. So in the big spectacle scene where the U2 gets shot down, did Spielberg really need to show off, proving 'Oh, I can do 'Gravity,' I can do 'The Walk'' just for bragging cred? And is it actually historically true that Powers gripped on to edge of his crumbling cockpit and just failed to hit the destruct button before his tether broke? (OH! is that a sneaky symbolic allusion to 'aborting' a mission?)This whole thing could have been done as a 15-minute documentary (not that I'd like seeing another documentary) rather than puffed up into a dry and predictable 'drama. When we see Hanks' character lying face down on his bed at home because he's so beat, I suppose if I were him I'd be concerned to hide my face for having accepted another such stereotypical heroic individual little man role.Do nasty CIA agents really skip into the air in peevish excitement like an 11-year old when they get frustrated? (Oh, they probably do.)It might have been more exciting to get into a row with the dopey woman in the seats behind us who kept aggravating my wife by kneeing and bumping the back of her seat - but 'Would it help?'So the Coen brothers helped write this. I guess Spielberg thought it might be more tasty to shmear some funky mustard on this baloney sandwich, but 'Would it help?' My fantasy is that the Coens were often snickering up their sleeves.",4,55,94,18 October 2015
Duck You Sucker," An epic adventure, and a very dark, wonderful drama.
","This is one of Sergio Leone's great masterpieces, maybe third in rank after 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'Once Upon a Time in America. 'But please don't consider it 'third rate' - if you value Leone, you will be blown away.The story takes place in Mexico during their revolution. James Coburn,in probably his greatest role, is a dynamite expert who flashes back traumatically to his past as a revolutionary in Ireland. Though Coburn is amazing, Rod Steiger is his equal as a Mexican bandit with his own views about revolution. In fact, in one moment of rage, Steiger's character 'Juan' sums up 'revolution' so effectively that'John' (Coburn) tosses his copy of Bakhunin into the mud.The cinematography is fantastic, the music by Ennio Morricone (what else to say). The staging of the scenes is magisterial, ala Leone.Essential to the story is the theme of betrayal and the karma of betrayal, both on a personal and political level, which enriches the depth. It has some of the most horrendous images of counterrevolutionary mass slaughter and political execution you might see.It conveys very well that if you are up against a fascist ('Nazi') - you know what you do? You kill the mofo.There are scenes of tragic sadness, and there is, all the way through, great humor.Leone's facial close-ups are used very effectively, most especially in the flashback scenes to betrayal in Ireland. Do NOT MISS the extremely subtle eye-gaze movements in those scenes, they are absolutely crucial!I watched this film on the big screen many years ago, and just viewed it online again today. I have never forgotten it, it is seared in memory.Got a light? 'Duck, You Sucker!'",10,3,6,30 May 2016
No Country for Old Men," Much to think about
","The ending of course frustrates many viewers because the intent, both of McCarthy and the Coens, is not so much to satisfy needs for a satisfying resolution of mystery, but rather to induce thought, reflection, and meditation on the depths of it all.My wife and I both enjoyed it immensely, even though she had to 'brace' herself for what she expected would be a gore fest. She was relieved that the worst for her was watching Chigurh tend to his own wound. We spent dinnertime and beyond brainstorming all the stuff that kept coming up from our churning associations.Many questions seemed unresolved. What happened to the money? Why did Wells spot the money case then do nothing to retrieve it immediately? What exactly was Chigurh's agenda - the money? rage at the incompetence of those who hired him? his own evil 'principles'? Why did someone like Moss fail to think, until too late, of something like the transponder? What happened in the scene of his wife and her mother being sent away? What exactly happens in the crucial scene when Sheriff Bell returns to the yellow-taped crime scene and we see Chigurh (inside that room?). If Chiguhr was in there, why doesn't Bell encounter him when he decides to enter? Did Chigurh take off? Bell spies the unscrewed vent grate, but what comes of that? Does Chigurh have the money? Did Bell take it? Yes, we talked at length about possibilities of Bell, the 'good,' honest lawman realizing this is 'no country for old men' and deciding to smooth his way to retirement. This is associated with his puzzling need to visit the old man in the wheelchair toward the end, and also his second dream described to his wife.So - unanswered questions for us all to discuss.But there's more.The title is taken from Yeats' 'Sailing to Byzantium,' and a review of that poem and its meaning may be useful.There is some obvious use of symbolism in the Coens' film, and once you begin to notice it, you start 'following the threads.' Car hood ornaments are prominently displayed. Especially telling is the Dodge Ram's head on the car Chigurh uses for a while. Aries (element, fire; house of Mars). But, more than Aries . . . the Minotaur! and now a whole new double-take about Chigurh's imposing, threatening presence. The Minotaur was also a demonic, unstoppable force of destruction, who pursued his victims through the labyrinth. Not only were the pursuits here, through hallways, stairways, and borders labyrinthine, but the device of Moss rigging a line to those tent poles in order to conceal and retrieve his treasure is reminiscent of Theseus using Ariadne's thread to navigate the labyrinth and survive the Minotaur.The horned image of the ram may also allude to a Celtic god, Cernunnos, a mysterious hunter.What puzzled us most of all was the possible significance of the Sheriff's dreams that end the book and the film. He dreams of his own father, ahead of him through a snowy mountain pass, carrying a horn filled with fire. There's also mention of money, lost, in the first dream.In our speculations we wondered how Moss's mother-in-law died. Her cancer? or was she killed? And could the money have been buried in her casket? If it was, my wife says this alludes to 'Huckleberry Finn,' which also contains a line about 'setting out for the territories,' which she recalls coming up in Bell's conversation with the old man at the end.I think I could go on, but I'll stop here for now. Definitely a masterpiece!",9,4,12,13 November 2007
Eyes Wide Shut," Just think.
","Each Kubrick film is primarily interesting in its predictable enhancement and elaboration of the rest of his body of work. Just think . . . Think - the evolution of mankind. Think - 'Traumnovelle' written by a contemporary of Freud. Think - An overseeing, controlling and protective presence who nurtures two young innocents, male and female, in a secluded world where anything can happen. Think - a 'snake'like smoothie seduces the young woman on the dance floor and draws out certain ideas and urges in her mind. Think - she follows her impulse to share this experience of knowledge with her man. Think myth.  Think Orpheus and Eurydice, perhaps reversed. Think Pandora's box. Think the fate of the 20th century in the light of the revelation of the workings of the Unconscious. Think Madonna & Whore.  Think 'redemption.' Think the final dialog - 'What do we do NOW?' 'What (WE) do is be grateful that we have survived all our (mis)adventures, whether they have been just dreams or reality.' Just think of Kubrick contemplating what he may have achieved.  No wonder, in a sense, what happened then.",10,0,0,18 July 1999
There Will Be Blood," Jaw-dropping indeed!
","The entire film is amazing, and is rich with themes of betrayal, exploitation, and the murderous animosity of man against man when it comes to the drives of greed and lust for power. In that sense it is especially akin to Kubrick's work.For me, it was the final scene between Eli Sunday and Plainview when I suddenly realized I was leaning forward in my seat, my jaw literally agape and half-grinning with awe at what I was taking in. It was both the intensity of the acting and the culmination of the currents of the whole tale from the beginning - who's the more greedy, who's the worse liar, who's the survivor and who's the victim - neither, actually, and who wins out when it's hypocrisy disguised as religious fanaticism vs the lust for oil, people and the Earth be damned? I think the final moments give an answer to that last question, and it ought to scare the britches off any fundamentalist preacher who thinks he can play politics with the money boys.",10,1,9,24 January 2008
Mother!," garBAGE, as they say
","After paying for the damned thing, I forced myself to finish it. I come down very firmly on the side of those who call it CRAP. There is no real talent in making up an allegory that keeps shouting in your face 'Hey! I'm an allegory!' And that's the problem - It's like when Donald Drumpf declares 'Ya know, I'm a very smart person. HYUGELY smart.' You want to hurl because you know he's an idiot.",1,23,39,9 December 2017
The Nice Guys," Great fun!
","I had a laughing-out loud ball watching this. Everything was '1977' starting even with the main title design. Then, like throughout the movie, something HORRIBLE happens that caused me a belly laugh!Crowe & Gosling were terrific as a couple of noodnik PIs, Gosling being the 'dumb and dumber' sillier of the two. There's one point in the movie when I swear he was doing a Stan Laurel. Come to think of it,'fat & skinny' are their style as a duo.Don't get me wrong, this was not a 'stupid' movie (sorry, I don't want to be politically incorrect to any stupids), it was damned smart. I've wasted too many tickets on so-called 'comedies' that were boring and laughless. This one, with a really high-action, at times scary- violent narrative, is also simultaneously hilarious.The Gosling character's daughter in the movie (Angourie Rice) was AMAZING, almost stole the movie from the two leads. She has a great future as an actress. Plus you've got a Coen Bros-like assortment of weird characters. It's all set in Hollywood and the hills, and that in itself is a touch of tribute to things like 'Mulholland Drive,' 'Bosch,' 'The Long Goodbye,' and (check it out!) 'The Big Fix' (w/Richard Dreyfuss). There's a stereotypically 'Hollywood' decadent party that reminded me of Peter Sellers' 'The Party' - including that Gosling's character may have had as many pratfalls, though at far greater altitudes!This movie is A-class fun! I don't think it's getting much theater showtime, so I guess we're gonna have to get it around by word of mouth. If ever a movie deserved a sequel, it's this one.",8,3,8,28 May 2016
The Great Gatsby," Don't believe the hype.
","Disregard all the hype about how the director couldn't really pull this off, that the spectacular style doesn't fit the story, or that the music is all wrong, etc.I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The 3-D technique captured an astonishing feeling of depth and realism. The acting was powerful and impressive. The character of Nick was given due respect of weight and authority. The story-telling gradually took on a very beautiful visual poetry. The climax and ending had me with jaw a-drop and tears welling up.Do see it in 3-D and do see it as soon as you can. My wife, a teacher, treasures the book and was very on guard for a disappointment. She couldn't go so I saw it alone and now I've told her she must come with me to see it again.",10,1,5,12 May 2013
