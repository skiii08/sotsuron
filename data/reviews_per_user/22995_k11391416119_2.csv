Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best of the series
","I never care what people say about movies, because the fact is that the most people are too lazy to think for themselves or are afraid not being taken seriously otherwise and just repeat the meaning of other people.I like the whole series but this is my favorite part, mainly because of the great action sequences. The pod race and the final fight are both brilliant.My favorite scenes in the Star Wars series are the lightsaber fights, therefore I like the new trilogy much more than the old one.Darth Maul is the coolest villain in Star Wars ever (way better than the uninteresting Darth Vader).",Null,3,6,10 July 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," Holy cow, they really made it with this one
","Actually 1 minute of silence is more appropriate for this movie.I loved the first one (it would be in my top 10 if not the sequels). I fairly liked the second one, mainly because of the good chase sequence. I was disgust with the third one. It really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I'm not saying that just because Matrix is such a famous movie. I didn't like a single second of this movie. Wachowski bros schould be ashamed choosing for the money they made by selling tickets to unsuspecting people like me. They succeed once, but trust me, I will never go see one of their movies again, just a matter of not giving them any more money for such crap.",10,0,1,10 July 2006
