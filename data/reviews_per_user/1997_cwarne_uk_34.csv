The New World," Pretty But Very Very Empty
","Terrence Malick is the director who became more and more revered the longer he refrained from making films. What this meant was that when he finally started making films again critics had invested so much in his legend that whatever he turned out would be acclaimed a masterpiece by some. So it turned out as people fell over themselves to praise the not very good 'Thin Red Line'. Some of that effect still lingers with 'The New World', but noticeably more muted. It's as if people are finally waking up to the truth that Malick's film-making gifts have actually atrophied in his long lay off. 'The New World' is a not very accurate retelling of the Pocohontas story. It has the usual Malick traits of flat acting, voice-overs and stunning cinematography. Unfortunately the weakness of the film merely shows how limited pretty pictures are in their own right. Some have described this as poetic (always a dodgy term in cinema). If it is it's poetry on the level of a Patience Strong not a Tennysson (let alone a 20th century poet). Malick refuses to challenge his audience as a true artist would (unless you count the challenge of staying awake). If you want to see a masterly updating of Native American stories see Michael Mann's brilliant 'Last Of The Mohicans'. This film is merely for those who want art-film made easy on the palate.",4,3,4,13 August 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Laughable melodrama
",Yet another highly praised 'hard hitting' film that turns out to be quite frankly rubbish. Clever editing can't disguise the fact that this turns out to be little more than 'Reefer Madness' in fashionable clothes. As inaccurate about the drug milieu as it is about psychiatry (ECT is done on anaethetized subjects - but obviously that does not film as well). Abysmally written and acted - Ellen Burstyns performance is straight out of a 40's b-movie. Immature and flashy - which probably explains the quite ridiculous IMDB grading.,1,46,88,23 February 2003
Se7en," Gruesome disguise for a series of film cliches
","-- Possible Spoilers --
1. Young cop and old cop together. 2. Imaginative serial killer with a motive. 3. Killer shows an interest in detective investigating case.Although admirably up-front this film at the end of the day falls back on some of most shop-soiled movie cliches of the last 20 years. See the list above and ask yourself how often they been used before. This at the end of the day is little more than a standard TV movie with a bit of gore.",Null,0,3,8 February 2003
Fight Club," Misguided finish
","For two-thirds of it's length this film offers some of the most bracing black comedy ever to emerge from Hollywood. Unfortunately the resolution of it all as some kind of apocalyptic thriller is pathetic and forces a downward re-evaluation of what has passed before. As with 'Se7en' David Fincher shows an inability to get through a film without resorting to cliche. Although this sounds negative I would still applaud the ambitions, although worryingly 'Panic Room' leads one to believe that this represents an end rather than a beginning.",5,1,4,8 February 2003
Citizen Kane," Base Metal Into Gold
","Pauline Kael in her famous essay on this film tried (wo)manfully to give all the credit to Herman Mankiewicz's script and Gregg Toland's camera work. It persuaded few at the time and is hugely unlikely when you look at the work both did outside of this film. Kael as a critic was always a doubtful proposition, her chumminess with the makers of many of the films she reviewed was on an ethical level with those internet reviewers who take cash to rave about Hollywood's latest mindless blast ie 'The Dark Knight' - an adolescent film for adolescents. The credit for this film is almost entirely due to Orson Welles, less a man than a legend even then. That said though, Welles has to take the blame for the film's shortcomings as well. The story is little more than the usual homily about money not buying happiness, wealthy Hollywood dished up this message gleefully to an audience that had no chance to test it's truth. The script contains some great lines but lacks depth. The psychology second rate Freud. The acting is variable, only Welles himself really managing to put any gusto into the film. Despite this the film is close to the masterpiece many have proclaimed, a fitting testament to old Hollywood's ability to turn trash into great cinema on a par with 'Casablanca'. How it manages this is hard to pin down (if it was easy to describe other filmmakers could achieve the same results with equal ease). At root it comes down to the sheer cinematic nature of the film, none before or since has used the medium's possibilities with such abandon or genius (this is one of those rare films that is unimaginable in any other medium). In the right mood you can surrender to this film and become convinced it is a work of art. Of course it does not stand up to serious textual analysis - few films can - but this is an American film that does not insult it's audiences' intelligence -a rarity then and even more so now.",9,0,1,26 August 2008
Oldboy," Bizarrely Lauded Comic Book Adaptation
","Oddly very few comments remark on the fact that this is a comic adaptation, because that's exactly how the film strikes me. I watched this very close to watching 'The Punisher' and would be hard pressed to say why this is lauded as a masterpiece and 'The Punisher' is pulp. The plot is pretty well incoherent, which given the nature of what one can make out is just as well. The acting is awful. The ludicrous fight scenes make WWF look realistic, and teeth pulling was far more sinister in 'Marathon Man'. 'Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance' is far better (though very short of being a great film) but the risible 'Lady Vengeance' and this suggests that Park is the latest over-hyped Asian talent.",5,6,13,23 July 2008
Superbad," Funny with (thankfully) few redeeming factors
","This is easily the best film I've seen from Judd Apatow's stable. Crude, but not dumb, and with plenty of laughs. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera provide most of the highlights. Hill in particular is funny for the whole movie, a feat that John Belushi often struggled to achieve. The only major fault is that it goes on too long, the last 20 minutes feeling drained - this is a fault it shares with 'Knocked Up'. As a comedy this is much better than 'Juno', it also feels much more real than that overpraised cute fest. If you think that a comedy's main function is to make you laugh, then this was the best American comedy of 2008.",7,0,3,11 August 2008
Juno," OK but lacks drama or bite
","How 'Juno' became a cultural phenomenon is more interesting than the film itself. A mildly amusing and mildly dramatic film it miraculously made many critics lose their minds. The movies faults come down largely to the screenplay. To put it bluntly everybody speaks too much and too 'wittily' (the 'wittily' is attempted rather than achieved much of the time). Their is little rhythm to the dialogue. The film improves somewhat after a truly dire opening scene in a pharmacists where the banter between Juno and the always unfunny Rainn Wilson is embarrassing in the extreme. The opening exemplifies the faults of the film though - the script is simply not as clever as it thinks it is. What saves the film are the performances. Ellen Page is fine in the main role. JK Simmons and Allison Janney (both exceptional character actors) have little to do as over-nice parents but do it very well. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman though provide whatever emotional pull the film has, Bateman in particular got nowhere near the praise he deserved. Michael Cera turns in another of his patented George Michael performances - it's all very well but it is impossible to imagine him and Juno having sex which rather negates the point of the movie. A tepid indie soundtrack adds to the underwhelming niceness of the project. Like 'Knocked Up' this is diverting enough, if you get through the opening you will likely enjoy it. The film does not stay in the mind though and it's main achievement is to make unwanted pregnancy 'nice'.",6,1,6,11 August 2008
Zodiac," Fincher's Best Film Yet
","I had my doubts about this one. Robert Graysmith's book is a disjointed mess that focuses in on a suspect who quite clearly was not the Zodiac. Fincher himself is a director whose most praised works have left me cold - Fight Club was a one-trick movie as bad as Haute Tension, the ludicrously named se7en a tacky torture porn piece with big name stars and none of the genuine frisson that proper horror movies give (artistically on a level with Hostel). The only reason I watched this was because I liked his underrated The Game a few years back. I won't delve into the plot, not that it is that important - always a sign of a good film. Fincher has obviously made this with one eye on All The President's Men, a very 70's New Hollywood feel permeates the film. The film is coolly shot on digital cameras which really show there worth here. Performances are generally good and Downey Jr is outstanding, as is the soundtracks use of contemporary music. Fincher's previous films have shown that he knew how to make movies, hopefully he has now cast of the juvenile impulses that spoiled them.",8,0,0,26 July 2008
The Prestige," The real mystery is the praise this film received
","Christopher Priest's novel novel on which the film was based is to my mind by far the least interesting of his that I have read. It's reliance on impossible, rather than speculative, science making it ever so slightly ridiculous to this confirmed rationalist. The best feature of the book by far was the complicated narrative methods it used. Needless to say this is totally lost in Nolan's tricksy film. The narrative here is disjointed, not for any obvious effect, but seemingly because this is now Nolan's style, a style he will use regardless of how appropriate it is to the film. What we end up with though is an uninteresting tale badly told, devoid of humour or life. Christian Bale is as mannered as ever, after several films in which he got to use his unconvincing American accent he now sounds equally unconvincing as a cockney. Hugh Jackman is slightly more watchable but Scarlett Johannson is wasted and Bowie as embarrassing as ever. Watching this back to back with the less feted 'The Illusionist' is instructive, that film was as predictable and old fashioned as could be, it was at least entertaining and Edward Norton runs rings round Bale.",3,6,13,4 August 2008
MASH," Central dishonesty now lessens movie
",As is only too clear this movie is really meant to be set in the late sixties and to be about Vietnam and not Korea. It is only possible to rate this film as highly as some people do by ignoring this. Unfortunately like many post Easy Rider films this appears very dated in it's attitudes. Altman would go on to much finer things later on. To sum up an interesting historical piece but not a film for all time.,Null,1,3,9 February 2003
Barry Lyndon," Monumental Bore-athon By Terminally Overrated Director
","Is Stanley Kubrick the most overrated filmmaker ever? He certainly had prodigious technical gifts, 'Barry Lyndon' may not be be the best looking film ever but it certainly comes close, stunning at times in it's use of natural light. He acted like an artist, slow-working and perfectionist. He was certainly uncompromising. In short Kubrick looked and acted like a genius, luckily for him in the world of cinema this was enough to get him proclaimed a genius. All of his films were met by gushing reviews - witness the response to the execrable 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Yet any true critical response to his films should attempt to explain the utter emptiness of his post 'Dr Strangelove' work. 'Barry Lyndon' is important here because for all its beauty this is as vapid as film gets. Kubrick drains all life out of characters, the wit and irony of Thackeray totally lost. Ryan O'Neal shows that TV support roles are his natural home (Paper Moon is the only film he didn't ruin), and the rest of the cast are forgettable. Kubrick is art-cinema for those who are scared of real art - it challenges one after all, he is great cinema for those who believe that great cinema consists of nice looking pictures. He is intellectual cinema for the simple minded. There is more life and art in 10 minutes of a Jason Statham film than in this bore. So yes I believe he is overrated and this piece of dross is first exhibit in the case.",3,10,27,7 August 2008
Apocalypse Now," Half A Great Film Destroyed By Brando
","'Apocalypse Now' is almost impossible to give a numerical grade to. The reason why is simple, while the first part is very good, the film simply falls to pieces once Marlon Brando appears. Full of unforgettable scenes and images the first part might qualify as great cinema except for the need for a narration to make sense of the material - a sure sign of the mess the script was in as shooting began. Brando in the end manages to destroy everything with a mumbling, mannered wreck of a performance. If Brando had given Coppola one of his great latter turns in 'The Godfather', here he gives the worst performance by a name actor I have ever seen. It stinks and anybody who tries to persuade you otherwise is deluded. Apparently Coppola was influenced by Herzog's 'Aguirre', and certainly both movies are a mixture of the great and the awful, what lifts Herzog's film though is Klaus Kinski's performance. In my dreams I have an 'Apocalypse Now' with Kinski in the Brando role -it's a much better film even though I'll never see it. The 'Redux' version adds running time but detracts from the film by much more and should be avoided.",6,1,4,26 August 2008
Independence Day," Beloved by morons
",This mindless trash serves one useful purpose - a liking for it has been found by educational psychologists to be a better indicator of sub-normal IQ than any previous test. The WTC bombing surely only serves to make these mass killing of civilian movies only more offensive. Recommended only to inbred rednecks.,Null,1,3,9 February 2003
No Country for Old Men," Superb Film Making
","Leaving behind the cultish tendencies that have marred their work since 'Fargo' this is the Coen's best film since that masterpiece. In outward terms a thriller this is really a meditation on change, both those that manifest it and those that suffer it. Javier Bardem is outstanding as a personification of malevolence, the emotional heart though is Tommy Lee Jones, superb as a decent man who no longer understands the world. Supporting performances are up to a very high standard, and short though it is it's nice to see Woody Harrelson that matches his peculiar talents. Beautifully shot and edited, and without an ounce of flab it was easily the best American film of 2007.",9,1,3,2 August 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A Great Revisionis Western
","Like all of the great westerns since John Ford this is a film about western films as much as the west itself. Long and leisurely, by the time it starts Jesse James is already part of a mythological west being sold to impressionable young men like Robert Ford. Ford gets close to the myth and becomes part of it himself. Starting brilliantly with a train robbery the film proceeds to deconstruct the myth and in doing so takes it's place alongside 'Unforgiven' and 'The Wild Bunch'. Brad Pitt has never been better than as Jesse James, he remains a mystery somewhere between an outlaw and family man. Acting honours go to Casey Affleck, just as in 'Gone Baby Gone' he shows how effective quiet acting can be. Beautifully shot and scored. This is up there with 'No Country For Old Men' as the best US cinema had to offer in 2007.",9,0,1,14 August 2008
Lawrence of Arabia," Empty epic

Amadeus," Unfairness of life

Mulholland Drive," Masterpiece
","Full of Lynch's trademarks, for the first time though he has managed to produce a film which involves the emotions.

Not only Lynch's finest movie, but the best American movie of the last 5 years.",Null,3,6,23 February 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Laughable
",Kubricks' 'masterpiece' achieves his career ambition - in it he produced an art-house movie for those too stupid too appreciate real art-house movies. A humourless sequence of pretty pictures hiding the blandest of ideas. Nice performance by HAL almost rescues some respectability but the woeful nature of the rest finally wears one down. The most overrated movie of the most overrated director ever.,Null,8,17,8 February 2003
A Clockwork Orange," Kubricks' celebration of violence. 0/100.
","It is abundantly clear that Kubrick was a film-maker of genius. This genius was not balanced by anything resembling a moral sense. This film with it's synchonized beatings and hilarious in-out rape scenes are indication of a creator who was so in love with the image that what was actually shown doesn't matter, as long as it looked good. (Think of the whole of '2001'.) There is a scene in this film where a middle aged woman is raped and beaten to death with the huge phallus she keeps as a work of 'art'. In many ways this is the crucial scene in the film. It is much changed from the book - but only in ways that make us feel that she was just getting her just rewards. Kubrick loads the dice so much that he is at this point more manipulative than Spielberg or Disney would ever dare. Are we supposed to think that a woman ( who quite obviously in the context has no man about the house ) who keeps giant phalli around is just asking for it - YES is quite clearly what Kubrick felt. Why does the film do this. Is it because Kubrick was a violence loving mysoginist. There is no evidence I have to say yes to that. The only answer that I can come up with is that Kubrick just liked the way it looked. That scene though is just typical of a film which dehumanises victims, family and everybody else. The only character allowed the merest semblance of life is Alex - our hero. Even if you appreciate the glorification of the thug, this is still not a good film. Most of it looks like some godforsaken mix of Lindsay Anderson and Ken Russell. The acting is constantly abysmal in that way that only British actors seem able to achieve. To sum up this is pornographic film making posing as a statement about free will. Your still allowed to like it, but be honest with yourself why.Incidentally the director of this film finished his career with a 3 hour snoozefest suggesting that adultery was somehow equivalent to murde. Odd that.",1,20,48,28 January 2003
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Cinema's 1 transgressive masterpiece?
",As this is a film that was meant to repulse and divide audiences a look at the comments here show that 27 years on it remains singularly successful. I really don't know what to think about it. At times it is almost unwatchable and at time excruciatingly boring. What makes the film worth it is the last 10 minutes which is both bleak and beautiful in a way which is unique in cinema. Pasolini's intentions are unclear and his anti-fascist and anti-consumerist messages seem like after the act justifications. Watching this film gives no easy answers and there is no moral pay-off. You will feel different after watching it but you won't feel better. Not recommended but you should watch it.,8,1,3,2 February 2003
The Fountain," Pseudo-Intellectual Codswallop
","At last we have a 2001 for our time. Kubrick's film was full of nice images and had all the intellectual content of a 3 day old slushy, not surprisingly it made imbeciles feel cleverer than ordinary folk. Aronofvsky had previously made the shockingly bad 'Requiem For A Dream', a melodrama so lurid and OTT it induced chuckles. I never believed he had the capability to outdo the rankness of that effort but astonishingly he has succeeded with room to spare. Over 3 different time spans of bad acting and worse dialogue we learn that love is good and death bad. Flicking channels after this I came across 'Beerfest', in it's own way a very bad film, it seemed like a masterpiece after 'The Fountain'.",1,7,14,30 July 2008
The Departed," Slick and entertaining but no masterpiece
","'Infernal Affairs' was a fun to watch but totally implausible thriller. It's no surprise that Martin Scorsese's remake is the same. The running time passes smoothly and it never jars in the way that so many Scorsese films do. After you've watched it though the questions start to pile up. The story is basically totally unbelievable and would work much better with a camper approach - John Woo achieved this with 'Face/Off', a much more entertaining film, mostly due to inspired casting of Travolta and Cage, two actors who can make the best of ridiculousness. Here instead we get DiCaprio seemingly taking it all very seriously and Matt Damon being as dull as he is as Jason Bourne. On the plus side Scorsese remains a technical wizard, a wizardry though seemingly divorced from any insight or guiding intelligence, to the point that he seems to fail to notice the pulp nature of the material here.",6,2,3,31 July 2008
There Will Be Blood," Hollow
","Daniel Day-Lewis's performance gets most of the attention here, which is just as well because the performance is the movie, whatever other characters appear being merely cyphers. Like the movie it superficially looks like art, on closer inspection it dissolves into facial and vocal mannerisms devoid of life. Long at two and a half hours, but feeling much longer, this is an arid and joyless experience - possibly the most po-faced film since the widescreen epics of the late 1950's. The film has no clear message, if as it appears to be that greed corrosive to the soul it simply doesn't work because Plainview is corroded from the start. As it goes on the film manages to get more and more ludicrous, the final scenes being hilarious in ways not envisaged by the makers. The hysterical response to this melodrama is a timely reminder of the gullibility of critics and that certain kind of viewer who (X-Files like) wants to believe that cinema is better now than ever before.",4,3,6,2 August 2008
Kingpin," Most Subversive American Film Of The Nineties
","A sort of amalgam of The Hustler and Witness this film has no wit, a creaking storyline and the most unattractive cast in Hollywood history. It's also one of the funniest films I've ever seen. The humour is crude and rarely rises from the gutter. It's a good reminder of how humour is the most subversive of genres and it works because it totally avoids camp - compare with the pathetic films of John Waters. A perfect antidote to Woody Allen and the endless stream of romantic comedies.",Null,1,2,3 February 2003
Stalag 17," One of Wilder's finest
",Super sharp cynical comedy-drama in the way that only Wilder ever seemed able to produce. William Holden gives his best ever performance as the archetypal Wilder hero - a cynical front masking a strange integrity. Far better than the bloated and pretentious Kwai. Matched in POW films only by La Grande Illusion and The Great Escape. Curious coincidence - in both this and La Grande Illusion the commandants are played by famous film directors - surely a sort of homage by Wilder who had of course already cast Von Stroheim in Sunset Boulevard.,Null,1,3,3 February 2003
Halloween," Genuine Classic
","Not a film that invented a genre as some claim - numerous Italian films and Black Christmas got there first. What Halloween did do though was perfect a template still used today. The legacy is pretty mixed as all too often gore has substituted for tension. On a purely formal level this may be the best made US film of the 70's - predominately long steadycam takes with quicker cuts being used to raise tension - this is a style of film-making that seems largely lost as directors and editors seem to try to break records for the number of cuts in a film. The music is outstanding and adds rather than distracts. Acting is variable as it is in all low budget films but Jamie Lee Curtis is very good. Between 1976 and 1982 Carpenter was amongst the finest filmmakers in America, Halloween is not even his finest film - that honour belongs to The Thing - it is the one he will be remembered for though.",9,0,1,26 July 2008
Paths of Glory," Kubrick's Finest
","I am no fan of Stanley Kubrick and consider all of the films he made after 'Dr. Strangelove' to be cleverly made, imbecilic rubbish. The basic problem was his world-view - apparent in the few interviews he gave - deeply anti-humanist and incredibly arrogant. That the later films are so devoid of intellect or passion may well be why he has become a favourite of so many who want films to be arty without actually being truly difficult. This has little to do with 'Paths Of Glory', made before Kubrick had developed the deadened style of those later films. Perhaps the secret ingredient is Kirk Douglas, here at his muscular, intelligent best and obviously deeply committed to the material. The gliding camera in the trenches and the battle scenes are amongst the best filmed moments of 1950's cinema - realistic in a way few English language films of that time were, the only comparison being in Japanese films such as 'Fires On The Plain'. The film is very cleverly constructed, playing almost as a two-acter of trench and aftermath, with a coda that is surprisingly moving. There are a few gripes, as always, the first one is Kirk's hairdo which is pure 1956, slightly more serious is the loading of the film against the generals - maybe this sort of thing is needed in cinema, but compared to literature it is quite crude. I would disagree with those who see this as an anti-war film - it seems to me to be simply a film that takes place in wartime. It may explore what war can lead men to do, but, like it's hero, there is little suggestion that it explicitly condemns war. Overall I would rank this as a great film, to my mind it is certainly Kubrick's finest.",9,1,2,30 August 2008
Raging Bull," Hollow
","With it's immaculate attention to detail and De Niro's oh so intense performance this film is as arid as any i've ever seen. Everything is rammed home at home at such a level as to drain any interest or life from proceedings. With Mean Streets and Taxi Driver Scorsese had shown an unparralled ability to capture a palpable feeling of contemporary New York. Since then his retreat into making what are in effect period films has been accompanied by overwhelming ' authenticity ' rivalled only by Merchant-Ivory. This film lacks pacing, humour and any feel of life lived.One of the most overrated movies ever.",5,15,31,1 February 2003
The Thin Red Line," The emperors' new clothes.
","Prior to releasing this Malick was well on the way to becoming regarded by many as the greatest director ever. As the years of silence continued his previous films - a routine early 70's road movie with guns and the one about farming that is useful as both a hypnotic and purgative - rose ever higher in the minds of those who see only artistic integrity in not finishing anything. It had to end of course and this film brings the hype down to ground with a resounding thud. What we have is a very average war film. Its not much fun to watch though as it has a HIGHER PURPOSE. This film aims to tell you that war is bad - cue much wordy philosophising. Add in beatiful cinematography ( I suspect Malicks real strength might lie in travel programs ) and a collection of ridiculous celebrities appearing to show us that at heart they are really ARTISTES whose usual output is some kind of necessary slumming. This film represents the worst kind of middlebrow trash - too posh to simply entertain and to stupid to make anybody think. I suggest you watch almost any 50's b-movie , Cross Of Iron ( Hollywood's greatest war-is hell movie ), Saving Private Ryan ( manipulative but more involving and more intelligent) or Apocalypse Now ( a film that dares to confuse, bore and amaze - a work of real artistic risk).",Null,0,0,3 February 2003
Gangs of New York," Final proof that Scorsese is a has-been
","That Martin Scorsese has been in decline since Taxi Driver is a truism that far too many movie buffs seem unwilling to face. This mess of a movie surely is the only evidence you need to back up a case. Scorsese's technical abilities are routinely praised but despite these, here there is no evidence of coherent narrative or character developement. Daniel Day-lewis's performance is ok in a cartoonish way. The rest are best passed over in silence. This film will garner Oscar nominations because Scorsese is seen as an artist. It is though only too apparent that the only movie brat who matters in 2003 is Steven Spielberg - who would have thought that 25 years ago. Perhaps there should be mandatory retirement for aged directors.",Null,0,0,13 February 2003

The Bourne Supremacy," Over Solemn Shaky Camera Bore
","Looking for all the world like a something shot on a mobile phone while falling down a flight of stairs this has to be the most horrible looking film ever made. Greengrass shows little faith in the plot (which is just as well because it is totally unmemorable) and so films in a manner that negates any possible plot. Shaky cameras, ultra-quick edits. It's all great if you think film is just a gimmick akin to an amusement park. It's a style that doesn't invite emotional involvement which is just as well because Jason Bourne has to be the dullest super-assassin-secret-agent in film history- he fits in with the the general tenor of the film very nicely though - everything is treated as solemnly as an Ingmar Bergman film. Watching this I began to yearn for some humour or camp, even a little suspense would be nice, as the film is clearly a money making package, rather than anything else, so sequels are inevitable, suspense is hard to generate. I watched this and then watched 'Crank', which is cheap, very stupid and a lot of fun. The only thing this film had in common was the stupidity.",2,1,3,2 September 2008
