Saturday Night Fever," This Film was Excellent!!!
","This was one of the biggest 70's film, of all time! The Bee Gees made success on the songs of the film!!! The soundtrack sold over a staggering 40,000,000 copies, features The Bee Gees and other pop artists!
The R rated version is the most watched, and forget about seeing the toned down PG version.John Travolta was successful in the film, and especially his solo dance into 'You Should Be Dancing'. Disco was big then, and it died in late 1979 (two years after the film premiered).This was the biggest hit of the Seventies!!!",10,0,2,9 May 2000
Detroit Rock City," THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!
","This movie is 3 times better than 'Kiss Meets The Phantom' (1978). This was awesome, and it was in 1978 when 4 teens trying to make it to Kiss Concert at Cobo Hall!!! Jam's mother Mrs. Bruce (Lyn Shaye, a religios cohort tried to stop her son Jeremiah 'Jam' from listening to Kiss! she felt that the Kiss letters stood for KNIGHTS IN SATAN'S SERVICE, and his friends knew that Kiss is not satanic, and in the school, she burnt her sons tickets and three of the others as well! Hawk, Trip, and Lex's dreams were shattered! Then, they drove themselves to Detroit, and went to the WURP station, and thought that Trip won the tickets, and he didn't finish completing his call, and they were furious. Few scenes later, they finally went to see Kiss!!! They faked the ticket takers that, they were mugged, and the other 4 were arrested for stealing and assault, the one man was the one that decked Trip at the Convienient Store!!!, and It was a great film , and hilarious!!!!       THIS FILM ROCKS!!!! FOR GET THE CRITICS!!!!",10,0,2,5 May 2000
Jaws," Excellent Film!!!
","Jaws, is one of my top 10 favorite film of all times. I really, liked the music when the sharks fin appears. Most of the people saw the film like five times a week in the theaters, and they loved the film. I give it a big 10",Null,1,3,21 April 2000
Carrie," This was the Scariest Film!!!
","In my opinion, this was the scariest film of all time. Carrie (Spacek), who has a religous mother, and the students taunt her, then she started reading books, and she even started to move things. At the prom, Carrie unleashed her abilities to make her tormentors pay dearly!!!I make that film a 9 1/2",10,1,1,9 May 2000
