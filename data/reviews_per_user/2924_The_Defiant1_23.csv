National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Suitable Sequel
","This movie is entertaining and very much like the first It's a little easier to follow. There are less clues to stake out and the characters are a little more exaggerated. It's one of those movies that keeps you involved so it's hard to get bored. There are a few implausible scenes but it's not a huge leap of faith just to roll with it.Nicholas Cage has been picking movies that make him a hero. I'm a little tired of Nicholas Cage, but I like the roles he's been picking and I like what he brings to the screen.This movie is worth seeing. It's good for all ages. It's worth renting or buying the DVD. Could it have been better? Sure. Overall I have no complaints.",8,1,3,30 December 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Blair Witch of Comedy Movies
","This movie is the 'Blair Witch' of comedy movies. The entire premise for humor is one of deception and being gratuitously offensive to those who are not expecting it.The formula is old. It involves laughing at accents and stupid behavior. Situation comedies have used this tactic as long as they've existed. 'I Love Lucy' had Ricky Ricardo. 'That 70's Show had 'Fez'. From there it mixes in a little candid camera and relies upon people not knowing they are being filmed.Beyond the unoriginal style of humor, it continuously wanders into content which can only be described as gay porn.Perhaps this movie is deemed funny because the audience is safe and secure in their seats and not a victim like the people in the movie. If you have empathy for anyone being needlessly and rudely deceived, avoid the movie. If are tired of people mocking different ethnic backgrounds, avoid the movie. If you prefer to avoid gay porn, avoid the movie.The amount of laughs will be either very great or very few depending upon whether like seeing people offended.",1,63,122,25 November 2006
Deja Vu," Great Movie
","I went to the movie not knowing what to expect. Denzel Washington always does a good job as an actor, but he can't magically transform a bad script or plot line into something good. In this movie he takes a great story and makes it better.As an ATF investigator, he quickly establishes himself as being knowledgeable about his job. When he's invited to investigate a terrorist bombing with a new technology, the roller coaster of intrigue begins. The technology involves the ability to see into the past and follow the events as they transpire leading up to the event. You have to pay attention to see if he's changing reality or just reliving the one that's already occurred. The small touches make this movie cool.Definitely worth seeing in the theater.",9,7,14,25 November 2006
Balls of Fury," Silly And Amusing, But Not A Steady Flow Of Laughs
","This is definitely a silly movie. It's the classic comedy centered around a sport, but in this case it's a sport few would care about. It's essentially a sports comedy, martial arts parody, and a dysfunctional teen comedy all rolled into one. It'll make you roll your eyes plenty of times. You probably won't belly laugh. It is however still funny and the moments are scattered regularly enough that it should keep your attention.Maggie Q is adorable as the lead female in the movie and she really steals most of the scenes. The rest of the characters could have been substituted with anyone. This is probably best viewed as a DVD release.",7,4,6,16 September 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Just Enjoyable
","Since I'm not really one to play video games, you'd think this movie wouldn't appeal to me. It did. If you don't think too deeply about the writing, it's possible to enjoy the movie.In this third Resident Evil installment, we get more but it's not just more of the same. Visually it's brighter movie because a lot of it takes place outdoors in the sun. It does flow like a video game, but the story evolves and should keep anyone interested. It's a good balance between action, story, and special effects.In this installment, Alice (Milla Jovovich) joins up with some old friends and survivors of the infection. While together, they agree that Alaska may provide hope for them, but not before they make one more stop for supplies. As in the other movies they must confront the infected zombies as well as the corporation which is to blame for their existence. The movie is packed with action and conflict. It's worth seeing in theaters. It's even worth buying if you like action & adventure. It's a movie to sit back and enjoy without asking yourself a lot of questions as to why or how. Just take it at face value and it plays out well.",8,3,7,22 September 2007
Zodiac," Great movie!
","Great Movie. Great value. After seeing so many short stories stretched out into 2 hours, it's nice to see a well paced story that squeezes all it can into almost 3 hours. This movie is a compelling from start to finish. It shuns the temptation to be sensationalistic and sticks pretty much to the known facts. The acting is excellent. On more than one occasion I forgot I was watching actors that I'd seen in other movies. The actors blended into the movie without becoming a distraction to the story. You get it all in this...mystery, intrigue, suspense. Unlike movies like Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, your time is not wasted on fictional back story that pulls you away from the true events. It has the best qualities of Hollywoodland. Every moment of screen time moves the story forward. See this on the big screen or DVD. Either one is worth it.",9,6,12,6 March 2007
Cloverfield," Love it or Despise it, This Movie is Different
","Cloverfield is essentially a love story. The city is being attacked by a monster and Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) must try and rescue Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) who didn't even know she was loved. His friends Lily Ford (Jesssica Lucas) and Hud (T.J. Miller) tag along to help. Hud films the movie so you rarely see his face.There are so many reasons to dislike this movie, but I didn't. For those who have seen the trailer, there might be concerns that the camera action is too jerky. It is. It definitely is. The movie goes for realism so you have to suffer through some scenes that strained my ability to follow what was going on.Regardless of the jerky camera action, I was leaning forward in my seat soaking in the action be it good or bad.A great deal of mystery has been surrounding the monster. It doesn't stop while you are watching. Like the original Alien movie, the monster is a tease. You want to see more, but they keep showing portions of it and just tidbits. Thankfully the viewer is not robbed and some really good perspectives do get shown.Although I did not laugh, many people did because Hud the cameraman isn't the brightest and some of the things he says or films does warrant laughter. It got a smile from me.The monster attacking the city is accompanied by some smaller ones. If you've seen Starship Troopers, that's the best way to imagine them. Some of the CGI wire frames looked like it might have been borrowed from Starship Troopers.The ending evoked mixed emotions for me. I really liked the way it was done. There were so many wrong ways it could have ended, but the movie shows a little respect for the characters and the ending is proof.",8,8,20,16 January 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Fantasy vs. Brutal Reality
","In the brutal reality of military oppression, a little girl escapes and uses an imaginary world to deal with the real world issues. Her world has the answers but she must prove herself so that those answer can come to be. The special effects are wonderfully delivered and the viewer gets to explore the little girl's world just as she sees it. Outside her fantasy world, her pregnant mother struggles with medical complications. Her stepfather creates a living hell for everyone and they look for real world ways to deal with the problems.This movie is medium paced and succeeds in creating empathy towards the characters.The violence is disturbing and the movie may not be suitable for young children. This movie is worth seeing in the theater because some of the special effects might look better when bigger than life.",6,0,2,28 January 2007
Gone Baby Gone," It's Not What I want Out Of A Story
","This is an extremely well made movie. It is an extremely well acted movie. Despite being well done and telling a captivating story, it just isn't what I want from a story or a movie in general. Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) are called in as private detectives by a family to investigate a missing child report. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman)and Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) represent the reluctant, yet cooperative police department that works hand in hand with the private detectives. The story evolves as a mystery leading the viewer along as everyone sifts through the lies and cover-ups. While this story is quite emotional and disturbing at times, the final message is a bit anti-climactic. It comes across more as a social statement directed towards an American subculture than it does being a plausible series of events. In the end, it just all seems pointless. It isn't a bad movie, it just isn't how I'd want to spend 2 hours of leisure time. Casey Affleck does a great job at keeping the story on track. Michelle Monaghan plays a convincing girlfriend/assistant. Ed Harris & Morgan Freeman never skip a beat on making you feel distressed about the little girl being lost. The ending just made me not care about how well it was acted and composed. Ben Affleck's role as director and screenplay writer seems to be invisible just as it should be. Anyone wishing to praise him or criticize his role, should spend their time reviewing his past work, not this piece.",7,8,11,11 November 2007
Watchmen," As Bad as the Comic...
","This movie, like the comic, takes every wholesome and positive things about the superhero genre of comics and tosses it aside. Alan Moore must have felt that he was brilliant when he borrowed the wholesome characters from the Charlton Comics line. He renamed them and turned them into murderers, rapists, tramps, and sociopaths. Like a lot of his work, he uses pop culture references and mocks them. In this case it is superheroes. Rather than try to intelligently incorporate the positive ideals and inspiration that superheroes bring to the reader, he set out instead to degrade and mock the optimism. He does this while retaining everything geeky and nerd-like in the superhero genre of writing.Visually this movie deserves an 8. The acting deserves an 8. The story however is so bad that it completely negates all the hard work done to make it look good on screen. The story alone drags my rating down to a 3. This movie suffers from one big problem that can be found in other bad movies... flashbacks within flashbacks. If these events are relevant, start the story with them. If they are not, put them on them cutting room floor. Dragging the viewer through a mystery, then tossing in a back story to justify it, is not good writing in my opinion. It's distracting. It muddles the relevance of the plot. It just makes me not care about the characters. The only character remotely interesting was Dr. Manhattan. Watching full nude scenes with him throughout the movie was just annoying. It was unnecessary and another reason not to care about a character. I was glad when this movie was over. It's a shame there was no nuclear holocaust to put the characters in the film to rest.",3,14,28,8 March 2009
Wanted," Your Eyes Should Roll At The Stupid Writing!
","I never bought 'Wanted' the comic despite the good art. I'm not a fan of Mark Millar's comic book writing. My hope was that the movie would be better than the comic regardless of how much I dislike Millar's writing. Thankfully someone else wrote the screenplay.There are movies that are so bad they are good. This isn't one. There are movies where the special effects are cool and you don't care about the story. This isn't one. There are movies where the actors are so good, they can carry a bad story and make it work. This isn't one. There are movies that just have a stunning plot and you watch it thinking 'Wow.' This isn't one.The story starts stupid and gets progressively more stupid at random intervals throughout. It's attempt to try and be clever fall short. It's attempt to be visually exciting just makes your eyes roll.I say don't waste your time seeing it. Ignore the DVD release. I'm going to give it 4 stars for being boring and stupid.",4,12,37,28 June 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Steady Laughs, but no Gut Buster.
","This is a very consistent and funny movie. It's a lot like watching a Saturday Night Live episode since quite a few SNL alumni play roles in the movie. John C. Reilly plays rock star Dewey Cox. Jenna Fischer does a stunning job as his 2nd wife Darlene Madison. This movie has a Forest Gump appeal as Dewey Cox rises to fame as a rock star in the late 50's. He lives through the psychedelic 60's and the be happy 70's. It features some excellent song parodies. It has a a lot of sexual innuendo. It has ongoing drug references. Be warned, it also has nudity and male genitalia. It's definitely a funny movie, but no gut buster. Expect a steady smile throughout. Perhaps the most unexpected thing it offers is a series of cameos from other movie stars. It's worth seeing in the theater. It's worth buying, but not if you have young kids. It's worth renting. This movie could be compared to Spinal Tap, Forest Gump, or any other movie featuring Saturday Night Live alumni.",8,3,8,27 December 2007
The Number 23," Lame
","This movie has no respect for the viewer's time. It takes a 15 minute story and stretches it into 95 minutes. In order to achieve this, they have to use a very slow narration and have everyone run around with some implausible frantic angst. By the time this movie showed anything interesting in the plot, I just didn't care. The problem is not in the acting, but instead the pacing. The story is just weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role is just out of place. His style of humor is not generic, so he comes across as a watered down version of himself. The number 23 causes great grief and frustration to the people in the story, but the justification for this is never logical. At most it's just mildly interesting. Jim Carrey has far more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals. Don't waste your money seeing this in the theater. Rent this movie if you've had problems sleeping. If you are still wide awake after 10 minutes, then you liked it more than I did. I was not fond of the lighting and artistic aspects of the film making either. A lot of passive visual eye candy was thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects and it did little to enhance the already weak story.",1,61,110,3 March 2007
Ghost Rider," Visually Stunning
","Having been a fan of Ghost Rider since the beginning in the 1970's, I was overjoyed that the movie was made. For me, just seeing the character come to full flaming glory on the screen was worthwhile. Like most movies derived from comics, the story is changed in ways that are both disappointing and interesting. While the changes clearly altered his comic origin, the heart of the story stays true to it. Where this movie lacks the most are the villains and the writing. The plot is fine, but the villains look like rejects from any of a dozen other movies. Wearing trench coats, and copping a bad attitude, they just aren't endearing or wickedly cool in the least. Ghost Rider has a good amount of screen time, but they don't have a lot of things for him to do. When he is in action, it's fun. The story links the old western Ghost Rider from the comics to the biker Ghost Rider. The writing definitely has some stupid elements, but I walked away pleased with the final product. Eva Mendes being in it is enough to rank the movie a 7. With all the other stunning visuals, I'll give it an 8.See it in the theater. Buy the DVD. Two thumbs up.",8,4,8,17 February 2007
Stardust," Good Film, Despite the Fact I'm Not a Fan of Fantasy
","This movie is very well made. Great cast with both the celebrities you know and those you don't. It has an exceptional score to go with it. Unfortunately I'm just not a fan of pure fantasy and that's most of what story has to offer. Expect a cross between Star War optimism and Lord of the Rings fantasy. It's a fairly bright and positive movie despite the antagonists in the plot. This movie delivered everything right whereas a movie like Eragon failed miserably. If you prefer movies grounded in reality and science, this isn't a movie for you. If you like a fantasy getaway where anything is possible, you can't find much better. Overall it's worth the money, but I wouldn't want to see it again. It has a few too many silly moments and almost qualifies as a comedy. I see no need to rush to a theater. Best suited for a DVD rental.",7,4,5,19 August 2007
I Am Legend," 7 - 6 - 5 - 4
","This movie just got worse as it went along. It started out interesting with Will Smith walking around a deserted New York City. He had man's best friend-- a dog-- right by his side. I'd have given it a seven at that point because it was interesting. The minute he walked into the dark to get his dog, I already knew there were 'creatures' in the dark, so it was just annoying at that point. I don't like looking at black screen. If I want to look at darkness, I can stay home and turn off the light. This is where I drop the movie down to a six. Creatures in the dark don't interest me. I've seen it before. Then we have to suffer through vague flashbacks and Will Smith talking to mannequins as if they are alive. I was bored with that, but I went along. So we have this brilliant scientist that can juggle microbiology, rigging explosions, hunting for wild game, guns, installing metal doors and gates. This guy can do it all, but he's amazed when he injects one of the creatures and it isn't healed within 5 minutes. I'm no genius, but even I know that cures take time. So I have to ignore the fact a very learned person is an idiot disguised.Will Smith's character goes the whole movie looking miserable because he's alone, yet a young lady and a kid are surviving fine. They show up and all he does is argue with them.The creatures have enough social structure to keep their dogs on a leash, but they can't stay calm two seconds otherwise. Why is it that fictional creatures only eat the healthy people. They'll chew their way through a ceiling, but they won't attack each other. What were they eating? The most merciful scene in the movie is when the dog dies. The friend I was with said the movie should have ended there. If it had, I'd give it a 7. Unfortunately didn't, so the best I can give it is a four. I kept wondering if the CGI for the dogs was leftover from some other movie.This is just my opinion, but heroes and legends don't earn their status by being lucky. The hero in this movie is inept. What happened to heroes having providence? They should have the ability to walk into a dismal situation and fix it because that is who and what they are.On top of everything else, there appears to be a Christian theme tossed in. It is a hero trying to save the lost. That would be okay if there was some interesting plot, but there isn't.This movie is not worth buying or renting. Save your money. The visuals are interesting at the start, but it goes nowhere.",4,18,27,17 December 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Okay, But The Trailer Leads You To Believe It's Better
","This movie is the much awaited sequel to the first Fantastic Four movie. On special effects, this movie delivers. On acting quality, it delivers. Where the story loses it is in the plot focus and the dialog. The movie is just filled with too many stupid elements that are side by side with all the visually stunning elements. Do we really care about the Fantastic Four's struggle with privacy? I didn't. Did we really need the Fantastic Four members swapping powers. I didn't feel it was necessary. Even the presence of Dr. Doom seemed unnecessary. This movie could have stood alone on the core story. This movie is worth buying on DVD or renting, but overall the story detracts from the special effects. If not for that, I would have rated it higher.",7,2,5,10 July 2007
Children of Men," Ugggh!
","Perhaps the saddest thing about this movie is the wasted talent in the cast. All are very capable actors brought down by the completely uninspiring plot.The viewer is immediately thrust into a bleak future where people are miserable and the world is sterile. The cast makes the most of this slow paced and unexciting movie, but they fail to ever make it interesting or compelling. Michael Caine delivers such stellar lines as 'pull my finger' repeatedly and Clive Owens spend the majority of the movie in solemn despair. Julianne Moore is initially set as a leader and focus, but she's pushed aside in the story fairly early.The basic plot is nothing more than a group of people's attempts to exploit the discovery of one pregnant woman named 'Kee' and use it for political leverage. The plot is essentially everyone's adventures as they get her from one point to another.With the exception of Clive Owen, this movie pretty much gets handed over to the supporting cast who reappear at illogical and random times. There is no mechanism which brings them back into the movie other than the plot's desperate need for new dialog and something to move the story forward.The future is so bleak and illogical, that their goal of getting Kee to the destination seems completely irrelevant and inconsequential. The movie boils down to a weak political commentary about life and the direction we are leading. The concept that the movie takes place in the future doesn't even come through very well. The settings and appearance of the locations look more like the 1970's than they do the future.Overall the movie is just slow paced and boring. The characters aren't exciting so there is very little reason to get excited about the movie.Wait for the DVD. This movie is a strong, bold 3 on a scale of 1-10.Defiant1",3,2,5,26 January 2007
The Fountain," Fertilizer
","The word 'fertilizer' sums this movie up. The movie starts out confusing but quickly gels into something just simplistic and bad. Trying to pinpoint which elements are the worst is like splitting hairs. Could it be the eternally happy female lead character dying of a brain tumor? Could it be the frantic, tense male lead played by Hugh Jackman? Could it be the way scenes are replayed over and over from different perspective without advancing the story further? This movie is an artistic way of telling us that we become one with nature when we die. The problem is that it's not good art. Basically it's message is that our bodies become fertilizer that grows into life around us and joins with those we love. It's mindless. It's prolonged. Save your money. If you must see it for it's artistic presentation, rent it. Most likely you will not want to own this.",1,20,37,25 November 2006
Hancock," This deserves some credit
","Perhaps I'm being generous, but I think this movie deserves some credit. It's a serious take on a dysfunctional superhero that isn't based upon a Marvel Comics or DC Comics character. The special effects aren't as good as a movie like Transformers, but at least you aren't getting an animated CGI character hopping around like you do in Hulk and Spiderman. It appears that several elements of this movie may be inspired by the now defunct Broadway Comics. The classic scene of a car being skewered on a spire was depicted in the 'Powers That Be' comic and the dysfunctional marriage relationship in the movie is not unlike the 'Shadow State' comic by Broadway. Perhaps seeing similar depictions hit the big screen made me appreciate the movie more.Will Smith and Charlize Theron do a great job. The hero is flawed, but he's not a wimp. The movie's biggest weakness is the pacing. Some of the special effects go by so fast that you don't get to appreciate them. Some of the drama plays out so slowly that you might be wondering why they don't rush it along. The movie is faithful to the trailer. It's tough writing a spoiler-free review of this since there are some great twists in the plot.",9,131,238,6 July 2008
Beowulf," Two Hours of Tiresome Dialogue and Cross eyed CGI Characters
","I saw the 3D version. 2 minutes into the movie I'm jolly watching the 3D effects. I'm loving it! 5 minutes into the movie it's dawned upon me that the whole movie is CGI effects. Huh? I don't recall that being obvious in the previews. Perhaps I should have watched the trailer a little closer. 10 minutes into the movie I'm trying to get over all the cross eyed characters. I'm trying to get over the character staring into space like they are blind. Next it just gets worse with tiresome and endless dialog. Essentially very little happens and there is a lot of talking. Several of the CGI characters run around as idealized graphic renditions of the actors. There is a lot of needless nudity that doesn't show any body parts that would be deemed taboo. 15 minutes into the movie I was debating whether to walk out or just sleep through it. I saw most of the movie, I just quit caring. This movie is the worst piece of garbage I've ever sat through on the screen. I did catch a little snooze, so I won't pretend to review the plot. I just did not care. I experimented with taking off the 3D glasses to see if the 3D was a distraction. I disliked this movie so much, that I didn't care if it was blurry or not. At times the clunky CGI was no better than stop motion filming. I was reminded of the movie 'Clash of the Titan' and I was remembering how much better that movie was.I wouldn't let a dog watch this movie. Don't waste your time on this. Don't rent it. Don't buy the DVD. Some movies are so bad they are fun to watch. This isn't one. This movie is just terrible.",1,18,47,16 November 2007
300," Neutral
","Based upon the Battle of Thermopylae, this movie is impressive in both it's pacing, carefully scripted dialog and visual images.It is a testosterone laden movie boasting manhood and masculinity. Both heterosexual females and gay males should be pleased by the display of muscles flexing and skin. The script consistently sets up a one-two punch for dramatic impact and few of the words are wasted.The story and the images are based upon Frank Miller's Dark Horse Comic book mini-series titled by the same name. The images and color palette on the screen come straight from the comic and it works very well.With all this praise, you'd think the movie would get a higher rating from this review. Here are some reasons why it doesn't.The story is very thin. It is essentially an excuse to show 300 men in bathing suits killing wave after wave of evil enemy. The setup isn't deep. The message of the movie isn't deep. The waves of enemies are intended to look more intimidating as the story progresses, but they actually look more stupid.Like other Frank Miller projects which have jumped to the big screen, there is always a disturbing portrayal of women. This movie is not as bad as his others because it only shows the women as unfaithful or as lesbians. His part projects tend to display women as hookers, whores, or just plain trashy. It is the lack of positive female role models in his stories that tarnishes this work as well as everything in which he is involved.The ending is not climactic. It is not poignant. It is not even clever. Given all the dramatic setup through the movie, it's actually very weak and anti-climactic.Although I have no desire to own this or see it again, that may be simply because I'm not attracted to men nor their inner need to boast upon their manhood.If the positives mentioned in this review are enticing to you, then clearly this movie is worth seeing. It is worth renting. It is worth buying the DVD. Otherwise hold out for a deeper more intellectual movie that has more respect for women and non-violent values.",5,2,3,10 April 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Longer Than a TV Episode, But No Better
","This review assumes you know about the Simpson's TV show. If you don't, then the humor in the movie is probably not going to be appreciated. If you are familiar with Homer, Bart and the whole cast of Springfield then don't expect an extravaganza. Homer sums up my feelings about the movie during the introduction. Since it's one of the better comedic lines, I won't give it away.The movie fails to be an epic worthy of the big screen. It's an entertaining movie, it just doesn't rise far enough above the weekly TV show to earn a higher rating.Do expect cursing. Do expect cartoon nudity. Do expect a lot of cameos and reappearances of past characters. Do go expecting to laugh. The problem is that the story is too similar to every other Simpson's episode I've ever seen. Every dramatic device used in the movie has become just a repeat of things we've seen before. In many cases the episodes were better than the movie. It is also disappointing that the trailer reveals too many of the laughs. It would be easier to appreciate some scenes if they had been a surprise.If you are a big fan of the Simpsons, go see it in the theater. If you aren't, wait for the DVD or skip it altogether. Overall I had better things I could do with my time, but it was still entertaining.",6,1,4,3 August 2007
