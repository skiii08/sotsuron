Casablanca," Hilarious
","I'm always baffled by the way that this film is held in such high esteem. Is this because it's old? Maybe it's because it's in black and white? Whatever the reason, it's certainly not because it's a great film. In fact this is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Wooden acting by wooden actors on wooden sets, (what about that ridiculous cardboard aeroplane? LOL). Forget what people say about this movie. Ignore the romantic gushing. Why? Because it's just plain rubbish. It's not even good enough to be labelled a 'B' movie. Quite possibly it's a 'C' movie, if there is such a thing. Nope, they certainly don't make 'em like this anymore.",1,50,155,24 April 2007
