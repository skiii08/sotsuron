The Ring," very scary
","The best horror movie of the year. This movie  brought something new to the genre and was surprising and held the suspense to the end. Maybe the conclusion was little naive but it did not spoil the overall positive experience. The official website is very scary, too. I would not recommend to watch this movie alone for anyone unless you want spooky nightmares.",9,1,1,1 September 2003
