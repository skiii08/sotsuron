Hereditary," Hereditary
","This is a great horror film and like all horror films, it's best to watch without knowing much about it beforehand. All of the acting here is good, but Toni Collete is especially fantastic.",10,3,6,22 June 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Hilarious
",I've watched this movie so many times and it's still wonderful.,10,0,0,25 October 2019
Get Out," So good.
","There's a growing, pervasive sense of dread throughout the whole movie. The acting is great, too.",4,1,5,25 October 2019
Midsommar," Not the typical horror movie.
",I loved Midsommar but it's definitely not the typictal horror. There are no demons or Jason Voorhees types. No one is running through a forest and tripping. There are no real jumpscares here. I think it was the director who described it as folk horror. It's kind of a cross between Children of the Corn and The Beach.,8,1,3,25 October 2019
Don't Breathe," Intense and mostly great
","The best things about this movie are the acting and the pacing. Three characters, one female and two males, decide to rob a blind man. I seem to remember that the blind man had been in the military years before but I'm not positive on that. The blind man became a total recluse after his daughter was killed and there are rumors that he has a bunch of money in his home somewhere. The thieves think they can just knock him out with some kind of gas and take the money easily. They're obviously very wrong. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't feel like we're supposed to like or root for the thieves all that much. The female character maybe, but even then only somewhat in the beginning to make us care about what happens to her later on. This made it better for me because I was on the blind man's side throughout the movie until the reveal that he was keeping a woman prisoner because he blamed her for his daughter's death. I loved that reveal because it changed my opinion so quickly and I wasn't expecting it at all. I could have done without the blind man trying to impregnate the woman and later the thief but I appreciate that he wasn't literally raping anyone because that wouldn't have fit with his character at all. Also, I loved the scenes with the dog in the car and I appreciate that the dog wasn't killed.",8,0,1,26 June 2019
