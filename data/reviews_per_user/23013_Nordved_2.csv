Iron Man 3," Iron Man is back
","The third installment in the Iron Man franchise is an entertaining movie like the first two, however i think of it as being a little dull when compared to the first two. The storyline is great, and actually a bit more interesting than others among these marvel superhero movies. Yet, it's ability to draw excitement is a bit watered down by the lack of Iron Man actually using his skills and the constant precense of jokes. Don't get me wrong - the jokes are good, and the movie itself is very laughable. Nevertheless, its hard to take a movie that is meant to thrill you seriously when much of is taken a sort of ironic distance to. It's as if the movie doesn't take itself seriously. But I must admit, that i did indeed like this movie and I can't help admiring every minute of Robert Downey Jr. playing this lovable asshole. Not to mention Guy Pearce's excellent acting as the total, yet tragic asshole. When it all comes down this movie is not the most thrilling experience, but it has good humour and some redeeming action scenes and actors. I would have given it a 7/10 but i am so much of an Iron Man fan that i can't help it but give this movie an 8/10. So if you're a marvel/superhero fan you will still love this movie despite it's flaws.",7,1,7,28 April 2013
Silence," A poster-boy film for boring Oscar-chaser films
","Yes, I said it; this film is outright boring. Silence is so overtly trying to be something worthwhile for the 'emotionally intelligent,' hipster movie-nerds to talk about with their friends, and in doing so, sound so politically correct that no one can ever wipe their calm and smug little bitch-smile away. We've seen so many films like this before - some group of people is being oppressed, and one man; their champion, fruitlessly tries to resist the oppression although his heart is so ever good and kind. I simply do not care for such subjects anymore, and neither do I care for Andrew Garfield's acting. It's like he's trying to look like a model who poses as Jesus in a photoshoot, but also trying out some kinda new trend, where dirt on your face and sad puppy eyes equals more attention from females. It's overacting, it's superficial, and its gross. Be original instead. Scorsese, just because you've made brilliant movies, it doesn't mean you should cover up the real world in dry, fruitless and monotonous narratives which so desperately tries to make an artistic impression. That being said, there are some pretty psychologically intense scenes in this film, and those scenes are at least worth watching...",5,0,0,1 April 2017
