Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This isn't bad
","I've heard from people that the plot's thin, Darth Maul's character too thin, and Jar Jar too annoying (OK, I agree with that last one).  But do I care?  Not a lot.I realize that this is not on par with the original STAR WARS trilogy, but maybe it's not supposed to be.  Remember, we've still got two episodes to go.  Not a whole lot is to go on before the legendary Episode 4.Only one gripe: Jar Jar, you ruined a little of the movie and you weren't funny.  Don't come back.",Null,0,0,9 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," incoherent even by Kubrick standards (spoilers)
","After seeing 2001, Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, and The Shining, I had to see this.  The previews and hype a year ago made this seem like a porn film to suck in viewers.  Even after you've rented the film, the film still tries to decieve you by putting the nudity scenes in the beginning. Halfway through the film, thoughts and questions quickly come up:'Wow, there's not much nudity after the beginning, and the beginning is where all the footage for the previews came from.  That was no accident.''What did the I-love-you-house-call scene have to do with anything?''There's not much sense of direction here.''Am I missing something?''What's going on here?  Will someone please tell me?'And then, after the film is over, more questions:'What was the costume ballet thing all about?  Who were they?  Was that all a set up for Harford?''So a hooker Harford never had sex with was diagnosed with HIV.  So what? It's a hooker!''About a third of those scenes should've ended up on the cutting room floor. A lot of scenes pop up that have no signifigance later in the movie.'I'm sure you'll find many more questions about the movie that will never be answered.  Maybe Kubrick knew he was going to die and just wanted to make a confusing movie with unanswered questions just to drive us crazy.",Null,0,1,13 August 2000
Scream 2," Breaking rules (good!)
","This movie breaks the unwritten rule about 80's (type) horror movies: 'If the first movie was good, the following sequels must rot.'  Scream 2 did a decent job of keeping up the whatever-it-was that made the original 'Scream' so good.  To be honest, however, I don't even remember the ending to this.  A lot of people tell me the ending wasn't great, which makes sense with my not remembering it.",Null,0,0,28 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," Unusual but good drama
","Actually, I saw this movie by 'accident'.  What I mean by that is that the previews made this look like a ghostbusters III with Bruce Willis.  When I saw this, I realized it was another ballpark altogether.  That made me feel a little cheated, but I watched this anyways.  Bruce Willis was great as the child psychologist; Haley was terrific.  Maybe it's me, but I think Haley looks like a small version of Edward Norton.  Weird.  In one of the stupidest summers in FILM history, this stands alone.  Drama lovers MUST see this.  Hint: Watch for subtle clues during the film.",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
The Matrix," Great sci-fi/action flick
","I finally saw this one, and I'm glad I did.  Some people didn't like the acting, but I thought it was fine.  The storyline seems to get in the way of the action at first, but if you take the time to watch this 3 or 4 times, the storyline ADDS a lot to the film and shows you that the awesome gun-flashing scenes had a reason to them.  Agent Smith was cool, the kung-fu action scene was cool, the guns were cool, and the special effects were great.  I don't want to dissapoint anybody by giving them high expectations before they saw the movie, but this is a great movie.  How can you resist the idea of being able to download ANYTHING you want to learn in an instant?  10 years of kung-fu experience downloaded into your brain in 7 seconds!  The idea is as seductive as time travel, which made Back To The Future so popular.  See this!!!!",Null,0,0,30 December 1999
