It," This is even worse than The Dark Tower
","I don't know what the hell happened here. None of the protagonists nor antagonists have a clear character distinction or motivation. The whole wonderful tale of friendship is simply not there and the whole Loser's Club actually fights and breaks up in the midst of the movie. The Clown comes across as a mindless frog-like creature and is not scary in the slightest way, I would have laughed if I wasn't so disappointed. The whole terror and magnitude of IT doesn't come across and is not mentioned and it is simply not scary! Even the 1990 TV version is way scarier and at least it kinda follows the book a little bit.I could literally rant about every single scene in this. An utter disappointment- and I had the lowest possible expectations. 'It'? Please! This is a bad CGI-joke that has nothing to do with IT. I'm still waiting on the real adaptation. Thank you.",1,3,9,22 September 2017
