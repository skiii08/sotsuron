The King's Speech," Aristocracy is boring
","As anybody can imagine, a movie about a man with a stuttering problem and his therapist can hardly be exciting or hard-core. 'The king's speech' is a small movie. A comedy about mid-30's England, social inequality and the suffering of the upper class. It focuses very tightly, both metaphorically and visually, around Albert, future king George VI and Lionel Logue, his speech therapist from Australia. Very predictably, the two have a difficult meet-cute, soon to become involved in therapeutic matters, and fast friends by the end of the movie. Most of their scenes are shot in interiors and revolve around Albert's gloomy childhood and his present shortcomings – he has a very nasty temper. Logue acts more as a psychiatrist than a speech therapist, encouraging Albert to let go of the past and build strength for the present and the future. Even trying very hard, it is difficult to sympathize with the future king, whose biggest problems were a cold mother, a nasty nanny and a dashing brother, making fun of him. Also, English snobbery it is not particular fun to watch, except maybe if you are British upper-class.The movie has a very slow pace, a great photography (a lot of frames could be used as stand-alone photos) and interesting use of light. Colin Firth is indeed very good, playing a part that must be a once in a lifetime opportunity for an actor. If he is going to win an Oscar, he certainly deserves it, but I liked him more in a 'Single man'. Geoffrey Rush is equally good and Guy Pierce excellent, as bad boy David. Helena Bonham Carter is scary, as usual. On the whole, a slightly boring, pointless movie, with great performances.",5,15,27,24 February 2011
Blade Runner 2049," Do tears freeze in the snow?
","BR2049 has more plot holes than emmental cheese and one big 'plot twist' that I won't mention, not because it would spoil much, but because if you decide to watch this movie, you deserve to be disappointed by its stupidity.The big 'twist' is mentioned as the 'miracle', but it is absolutely idiotic and illogical from the point of view of a manufacturer of replicants. How did 'that' might have ever be considered a good idea? One would assume that after the disaster of the Nexus 6 series, Tyrell Co. and his successors would have invented some more reliable security system - such as a lower level of self-consciousness, way safer than the questionable 'obedience' of the Nexus 8. Or even something like all the androids looking the same, so that they can be easily detected and you would not need blade runners to locate and eliminate them.Anything that would provide humanity with useful, free labor without ethical problems But no, in this movie ethical problems just got exponentially bigger. And so much for a science so advanced as to reproduce perfect bodies and minds...Besides, since it is established that humankind sucks, I failed to understand how replicants are in any way better, since they just want to be more 'like humans'. On the visual side, BR2049 sucks, too. Looks like they used random leftovers scenery from other Sci-Fi/disaster movies, from the overused industrial background of Terminator to the desertic blurred landscape of MadMax and the inevitable nightmarish city-scape, which looks like Blade Runner, but on cheap side. Costumes looks like the contemporary drab clothing promoted by Nordic high street chains: lots of dark, cheap-looking leggings and stretchy tops, a far cry from the decadent, elaborate futuristic/retro suits of BR.In one scene, Deckard meets Tyrell's successor in a closed room filled with water, except a square island in the middle. A room that has no other reason to exist except bringing back memories of the 'original' Tyrell building.The dialog is unbelievable bad and scenes drag on forever. When the Goslin character finds Deckart, the two spend over ten minutes fighting and chasing each other, when a couple of lines of dialogue would have avoided that. The ending is both manipulative and plagiarist: it wants to move the audience, recreating the amazing poetic moment of Roy Batty's death, but using snow instead of rain. If nothing else, the ending would have been enough to put me off this piece of commercial garbage.",1,252,474,15 October 2017
The Monuments Men," Clooney performs as a Clark Gable clone
","George Clooney directed this old-fashioned movie and starred in it looking like Clark Gable. Despite the negative reviews, there is nothing basically wrong with the movie. It tells a straight story, based on facts. It has a short introduction, where we get to meet all the main characters; a development, where we follow the different characters in their adventures and an end that wraps up the whole film.Granted, today's audience, used to fast editing, special effects, gore and over the top scripts may find it difficult to appreciate what is really old school story-telling. However, some of the reviews I read here do not make any sense: somebody complained about 'lack of character development', but they should know that in movies with a large cast, character development is hardly a priority.Somebody else mentioned that it is 'absurd' to leave gold and art in cave. Well, that actually happened for real, as the retiring Nazis could not carry all that stuff with them. Just check the historical records Other complained about 'yet another movie about WWII'. Perhaps they should check in advance which movies they are going to see, if they do not care about WWII movies.I agree about the fact that given the premises it could have been a better movie, but I still found it entertaining. Murray, Damon and Clooney were good as usual and even Blanchett, in a small role, managed a decent performance. Definitely not a masterpiece but an enjoyable movie to watch, especially if you like classic movies moving at a slower pace.",7,0,1,16 March 2014
Source Code," An ethical journey into basic emotions
","'Source code' is a complex movie. It has been described as an action movie with a twist, exploring a territory similar to 'Inception'. Although it is partly that, I see 'Source code' more as a very original journey into basic emotions.Indeed, 'Source code' is more 'Groundhog day' with a twist than an action movie. The plot in a nutshell: Gyllenhaal plays Colter Stevens, a marine whose last memories are fighting in Afghanistan, who wakes up in the body of an unknown man. This man is travelling on a train leading to an unknown city. Looking at his reflection on the window, Colter sees the face of a stranger, rather than his own.That must be an extremely scary experience, but worst is to follow. The train explodes sending Colter into a capsule, where he is debriefed by a female officer. She tries to convince him that some unlikely science can connect him to the last eight minutes of memories of a guy named Sean who died on the explosion and that his job is to go back to the train until he can find the terrorist who planted the bomb.This set up is intriguing, albeit highly unlikely, except in SF world. But what gives away the real plot is the fact that Sean is travelling with an attractive female friend, named Christina, and very quickly Colter's mission turns into trying to save her, while getting to know her better.The terrorist plot can easily be left aside. Indeed, it is left aside also in the movie, as anybody can easily guess who the terrorist is. The viewer should focus more on what is really going on with Colter and Christina. They both are likable characters and we hope against 'logic' that there might be a future for them. The investigation part of the plot fades in the background, while we start rooting for the main characters and hoping their lives will somehow be spared.Luckily, being this a SF movie, logic can be easily defeated. Another twist of the improbable science could send the epilogue into a direction more convenient for Colter and Christina. And still, we are left doubting about what really happened and in which dimension.",8,0,0,26 April 2011
Skyfall," No matter what M:I and Bourne did for the spy genre, we're back to the same rehashed scenario
","Stripped down of all the Bond usual decorations (girls, chases, gadgets, exotic locations, etc) Skyfall has a very simple plot: a disgruntled ex-employee wants to take revenge on the employer who dumped him. Unfortunately, and proving once more that Bond films are just appearance over substance, this logic premise falls down the drain at every twist and turn.So as not to attract attention to his plan, the villain steals a top secret list and makes it public. That is definitely the best way to be inconspicuous. But what the villain wants is simply to be captured and taken into custody, close to his intended victim. Such victim is a frail old lady who presumably can be dispatched very easily, just by taking a trip to London and ambushing her at her house.However, it turns out that killing the lady is a lot more difficult than it seems and even placing a bomb inside the HQ of the secret service is not up to the task – although it spreads serious doubts about the professionalism of MI6.Added randomly to the mix are bits and pieces from countless other successful movies: Mission: Impossible (the stolen list, which is forgotten half way into the movie), Blade Runner (the stunning Shanghai night scape), Inception (the Oriental casino), and The Silence of the Lamb (Hannibal's glass cage) etc...The result is a boring, overlong mess that does not make much sense.The villain, played by an embarrassing Bardem wearing a blonde wig, is hardly scary at all. He acts like a rejected child who wants to attract the attention of his mummy. Bond is weary and demotivated (and so are we, at this stage). He beds a couple of gorgeous women in a couple of bizarre scenes, both superfluous. He is out of shape, but he manages to kill almost single-handedly a dozen baddies assaulting his home. One of the field agents is actually a secretary. Ralph Fiennes looks fat, bold and very middle-aged whateverThroughout the movie I started thinking that even Quantum of Solace was better than Skyfall and that leads to the final questions: what about the delirious reviews about this being 'the best Bond ever?' Were the official reviewers bribed to glorify the 50th Bond anniversary? What did they drink (or smoke) before writing their reviews? Did they watch the same Skyfall movie I watched or perhaps a special edition just for them?Die-hard Bond fans will love it anyway. They love them all, even if it is always the same story, re-told with small variations: Bond is invincible and irresistible to women and he always saves the world, thanks to a few gadgets, his Martinis and his beloved car. No need to invent anything new.",3,5,12,29 January 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The mother of countless silly action movies
","Since everybody knows what this movie is about, mine will be a review of the strongest and weakest points. At the time of release, this seemed a brand new approach to storytelling. I am not surprised it was a big success: Harrison Ford was smoldering hot and the supporting cast was great, with a special mention to John Rhys-Davies.With the passing of time and repeated views, I find the following weaknesses, common to many Spielberg (and action) movies: <ul><li>the overbearing soundtrack. I know many love it, I cannot stand it anymore. During the truck chase scene, there is nothing but the loud orchestra score booming ceaselessly, while Indy gets beaten but bounces back like a rubber man </li></ul><ul><li>the thin plot. The search for the Ark is just an excuse to create one action scene after the other. They increase in violence and implausibility, until the last one, possibly the silliest of the movie </li></ul><ul><li>the last 'action scene'. The ritual proposed by Belloq serves no purpose, apart from providing a bombastic ending to Indy's troubles. Anyway, it is unbelievable to imagine that Nazi troops would indulge the request of the French archaeologist </li></ul><ul><li>the 'super hero' nature of Indy. Despite the premise that he is a 'normal' guy, Indy is shown to suffer only slightly from inhuman beatings </li></ul><ul><li>all the sequels. None managed to reach even half-way the level of 'Raiders' and considering this one already had its flaws.</li></ul>On the plus side: <ul><li>there are some moments of humour, unfortunately not enough. The best is the famous scene of Indy shooting the huge, menacing black-clad guy in the market. For one precious scene like this, we have the long and pointless fight with the German guarding the plane, back to conventional narrative </li></ul><ul><li>an attractive hero with some intellectual pretense. Indy is supposed to be a beauty with a brain, contrary to way too many superheroes who are infesting the silver screen (even more so nowadays)</li></ul><ul><li>the ironic ending</li></ul>Conclusion: what seemed an innocuous narrative that looked back to the old serial movies of the past, turned into a monster that spawned endless sequels and imitators, creating the action-without-soul blockbusters plaguing more than ever contemporary cinema.",5,6,11,10 April 2017
In Bruges," Bad copy of 'Sexy beast'
","The plot in a nutshell: two hit men are 'hiding' in Bruges, their boss is angry because one of them messed up his first job, some redemption and hope at the end. So far so good, apart form the fact that I was not specially in need of yet another Brit-underworld movie. However, the main problem with this one is that it tries too hard. It tries hard to be - at least - like two very good movies, such as 'The third man' and 'Sexy beast'. It tries hard to be funny, cool and smart, failing miserably along the lines. It tries hard to make Bruges look like a place you want to visit (I have been there and I agree with the Colin Farrel's character - it is not, to put it mildly)The part where it tries to be 'The third man (in Bruges)' is obviously the location and night scenes, but also the fact that the main villain is named Harry. Said villain is played along the lines of the great Ben Kingsley - the psycho you'll love to hate, which made 'Sexy beast' such a good movie -.Ralph Fiennes tries too hard to upstage Kingsley, but he is never believable as the gang leader with a personality split between the psycho and the loving father. Kingsley is just unbeatable exactly because he was constantly over the top, with none of the mushy sentimentality of a good father. But the huge, black hole of the whole story is the attempt of making us believe that these criminals actually 'care' about strangers. Unfortunately, there is no honor among thieves. If they are criminals it is exactly because they do not care about collateral damage, being it a pregnant woman, a harmless child or an elderly guy.Finally, it is extremely difficult to root for any of the characters. They are incredibly verbose, just go on and on with lines of absurd dialog; act in ways that are not consistent with criminal backgrounds and are simply very unlovable. Colin Farrell is supposed to be the nice 'bad' guy but he is quite nasty, with serious anger-management issues which would suggest he is way beyond redemption. In a restaurant scene he hits a man AND his girlfriend, just because they complained about cigarette smoke. If that is acceptable behavior in somebody's book, is not in mine. I would object having my face smashed even by a good-looking thug like Colin.I am surprised by the good reviews, but maybe it is because I have been in Bruges and totally do not care to go back.",4,8,23,6 July 2008
John Wick," A parallel criminal world packed full of clichés
","Not being a fan of action movies I watched this on TV, out of a mild liking for Keanu Reeves. I know he has a reputation as a bad actor, but at least he never tries anything he cannot handle.Reeves is John Wick, a super-assassin living in what I gather (or hope) is a parallel world. Wick 'retired' to live with his wife but she died and left him a puppy as a goodbye gift.The premise of the 'retired professional' is one of the stalest in the movie world, such as the killer with a heart and we get both in this movie. Wick gets out of retirement to avenge the killing of his dog and the theft of his car. Obviously, it is no regular villain who angered him, but the reckless son of a Russian mega-mobster.Moving from his designer villa to the city of New York, Wick gets to stay in a luxury hotel called the Continental, where criminals must refrain from 'conducting business' or else being 'excommunicated' from the great criminal brotherhood.Wick's criminal pals are sympathetic about Wick's loss and also scared of him, because of his fierce reputation. Knowing that 'honor among thieves' and criminal luxury world are bulls**t, helps rooting for Wick's revenge. It also helps that the villains are Russian mobsters and everybody knows the world can do without them.As in every action movie, one also knows that the hero is next to indestructible and that some preposterous fighting scenes will pave the way to a car chase sequence (or vice-versa). As long as you keep your expectations low, Wick will deliver. Reeves is predictably laconic and the world his character inhabits is suitably menacing and dark, a sort of lawless Gotham city.PS I did not see this threadbare plot as an opening for sequels, there being very little original material to carve out more stories, but unfortunately it happened... and it just went downhill.",5,1,4,6 August 2017
Gravity," I used to think being an astronaut was great... but for sure you see a hell of a landscape
","As everybody knows there are only two actors in the movie and they wear spacesuits and helmets most of the time. Therefore, acting and human interaction are not the key. Personally, I think too much time was given to Sandra Bullock and her dramatic situation. Clooney would have provided some buoyancy and made the movie more interesting character-wise.If I have to point out one major defect, I found it silly to have Bullock look so good, with no sign of injuries or dirtiness and with her hair perfectly combed. Yes, she was mercifully make-up free, but otherwise she looked like she had just stepped out of her bed after a refreshing night's sleep.For me, the film is an ode to the beauty and dangers of space, the only 'virgin' territory left to explore. I used to think that being an astronaut was great, but I had to reconsider. Besides, the film is an example of 3D put to good use. The three-dimensional effects worked wonders in most sequences.We see earth and all the meteorological events we observe from down here, we see sunrise from an astonishing angle, small objects float towards us and we even get the 'personal' point of view of gazing through the helmet of one astronaut. The soundtrack was also great, underlying dramatic moments without being too bombastic.There was also a major technical blunder which you can found out by yourself, but on the whole I must confess I am a sucker for movies set in space where the space is the main character and I got totally lost in this one.",9,5,9,27 October 2013
As Good as It Gets," As long as it takes...
","And it takes very long to get anywhere in this tale. The Nicholson character is Melvin, a grumpy guy with OCD, who happens to be a famous, wealthy author living in Manhattan. His neighbor is gay painter Kinnear, owner of a cute dog who steals the show.Melvin eats in the same place and wants to be served by the same waitress (Carol, the Hunt character). She is extremely neurotic, because of her sick son.Through a series of very unlikely circumstances, these three will get together and bond. Apart from the implausible plot, there are masses of scenes that could easily be cut or shortened, especially those with Helen Hunt.Carol talks a lot, is weepy, very motherly and nurturing. Most scenes with her mum could be cut; the conversation with the 'good' doctor is cringeworthy; Carol and Melvin out for a sort of date drags for a long time and it's a frustrating scene, once again because of Carol bitchy attitude... and so on.Annoying and often boring, definitely overlong.",3,0,6,22 October 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Fictional basterds take no prisoners
","In our sombre days of politically correct, Nazis are just about the only villains who can still be mistreated and abused on screen - but possibly not for long, considering the controversy around 'Der untergang', the movie that should make us feel sorry for Hitler. However and luckily for the public Tarantino does not care about feeling sorry for the Nazis and delivers a great dark comedy.The setting is in occupied France during WWII, but the events are purely fictional – this is NOT a DOCUMENTARY!!!! The Nazis portrayed in the movie are archetypal bad guys, just about as realistic as Freddy of the 'Nightmare' series, or Aladdin and his magic lamp. Unfortunately, part of the public seems unable to understand this and criticises the movie as if it has any pretense of being based on a true story.The movie follows two main threads: the activities of the 'basterds' – a group of American Jews sent to occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis and the revenge of a French Jew girl, who barely escaped from the massacre of her whole family.I find the movie main fault in this double-thread. Contrary to what one might believe, the 'basterds' of the title are only secondary characters. It is a shame because each scene featuring them is pure fun, from the memorable speech which introduces the group to the final, mass-destruction scene in the cinema. The part about Shosanna and her revenge is drawn-out, melodramatic and a bit too close to reality to be just pure fun.As usual with Tarantino, some of the dialogs are a bit too fancy and tend to dilute the tension of some scenes, but I truly appreciated the use of several languages, rather than a monolithic usage of English, as it happens in most American productions. However, I do understand them all, and I can even state that the Italian spoken by the snotty Colonel Landa is not as good as it might sounds.Contrary to what I feared, Brad Pitt is actually quite good and the character he plays delivers the funniest speeches. Equally good are Fassbender, as a parody of a stiff-upper lip Brit officer and Schweiger, as the completely crazy and OTT Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz. Much was written about Christoph Waltz performance, and even if just about everybody (even those who hated the movie) seems to have liked it, I personally found it overstated and slightly garish. Even if this is a comedy, at times his character appears to be just plain silly. Nonetheless, he is probably Oscar-bound for what is basically a shrill portrayal. Still, the Oscar are not anymore a landmark of professionalism....... Finally, this is the best Tarantino since 'Jackie Brown' – which was a long time ago. Apparently, QT is not quite worn out, but let us hope he will be able to streamline his movies a bit more in the future, especially by cutting down the verbosity of some characters.",8,1,7,29 September 2009
Seven Years in Tibet," This is a movie, not a documentary
","A movie is by definition a fictional tale. It may be based - more or less loosely - on real events, but it is still a fiction.This part seems to have escaped many 'reviewers' as it always does when a movie is based on 'real events'. In real life there are long periods when nothing exciting or interesting happens, but a movie cannot follow a character 24/7 in his daily life, even if that life takes place in Tibet.This story is very loosely based on the experience of Austrian climber Heinrich Harrer, who embarked on a climbing expedition on the brink on WWII and ended up as POW in a British camp in India, for most of the war.Having no reason to go back to Austria, he then ended up in Tibet where he met and became tutor to the 14th Dalai Lama. His adventure ended with the Chinese invasion of Tibet. That's it and it is already quite a lot.The plot is a journey of discovery, not only geographical but also psychological. Thanks to his experience, Harrer turns from selfish, arrogant and uncaring into a gentler human being.According to those who read Harrer account of his story, the film takes a lot of liberties, inventing episodes that - for me - are just supposed to make the story more cohesive. Also, I did not care much about Harrer involvement with the Nazi party, for which he apologised and that clearly was not the core of his existence.Finally, for those who protest because the movie does not explore Tibetan culture, once more this is based on Harrer's tale, from is point of view. You want to know Tibetan history and Buddhist culture? There are thousand of non-fictional books and documentaries to fulfil this purpose.",7,0,0,31 March 2020
Zootopia," Lovely movie with cute animals and amazing animation
","Not surprisingly, another animated film is among the best I watched recently. The anthropomorphic animals of Zootopia are among the most lovable creatures ever created.Main character Judy Hopps is the first bunny cop in town and she is not taken seriously by her colleagues. In Zootopia predator and prey live side by side, but they tend to stick to their 'natural' inclinations, therefore most cops are big and aggressive animals. They resent bunny Judy and give her a hard time.Judy get acquainted with grifter fox Nick, then starts working on a missing person case. Nick is blackmailed into helping her and the two develop a friendship.The animation is just astonishing, with amazing details, such as the busy Zootopia main station where different animals get different treats according to their size (giraffes and mice can cohabit, but with precautions).The plot is funny, with plenty of little jokes but also a serious message of tolerance. I would have given it a 10, but I do not agree completely with the naive message that 'anybody can do anything' and 'biology is irrelevant'. Overcoming prejudice is just as important as understanding and accepting that there are limits to what each individual can do - while still trying to to do our best. Otherwise we fall back into super-hero territory.",9,4,7,1 April 2017
Public Enemies," Gangsters are nice guy
","Much as I like other Michael Mann movies, I truly despised this one as a manipulative cross between 'Last of the Mohicans' and 'Heat'.From a visual point of view the movie is beautifully shot with a real feeling for the 30's, yet the scene of the chase through the woods reminds of the Mohicans. The soundtrack too is reminiscent of that movie. The scenes of bank robberies, though not as powerful as in 'Heat', convey the same type of manic energy.The love story which forms the heart of the story is also supposed to be moving and romantic like those depicted in the two other movies. Unfortunately, the two lovers of this movie are superstars Depp and Cotillard, playing a ruthless gangster and a dumb girl who think they are living the romance of century.Besides presenting the tragic story of the star-crossed lovebirds Mann does his best to prove how stupid and inept policemen are. It is exactly here that lays the fraudulence of the movie: some scenes have no purpose whatsoever, but are just built to enhance the reputation of superstar Johnny Depp, playing a very romantic tragic hero. Among all, the scene of Dillinger entering the police station and walking around, without anybody challenging his presence or recognizing him, truly has no purpose whatsoever, but to prove how supremely stupid cops are.The romantic angle can also be debated, with Dillinger uttering to Frechette lame sentences on the phone, such as 'I want to protect you', while he is on the run from the police. Hard to see how he is going to protect anybody, but it does sound good. The same applied to Frechette, challenging the police while being interrogated and telling them how stupid they are. However, since she got arrested and is going to be sentenced to two years of prison, she seems hardly in the position of being the smart one.Since Depp is a superstar the movie must drag on forever, and thanks to the useless of several scenes it takes quite a while before the final showdown. You can finally leave cinema with the uneasy feeling of having been taken for a ride.",4,3,6,1 August 2009
The Danish Girl," A tighter editing and a different male lead could have helped
","Loosely based on a 'real' story, the plot is about Einar Wegener/Lili, one of the first transgender people to undergo surgery. The story starts in 1926, with Einar happily married to Gerda. Both are painters, enjoying some fame in Copenhagen. One day Gerda asks Einer to wear silk stockings to pose for an unfinished portrait of a ballerina and from then on Einar starts discovering Lili, his 'female' side, which will end up 'killing' Einar.Gerda pursues her career and finds success with Einar's portraits as his female counterpart Lili. The couple moves to Paris, where Einar can leave more openly as Lili in the bohemian artist society. Also, Gerda meets a former friend of Einar, the brooding and all-male Hans, who stirs feelings presumably more pleasant than dealing with your husband's trans-sexuality.After several disastrous meetings with different doctors, all of whom think Einar is insane, a German surgeon finally announces he will try to help Einar getting rid of his male parts and start living fully as Lili. Gerda, supported by Hans, decides to stick to Lili's decision and stays with her 'husband' during his medical treatment. However, surgery is a risky business, even more so a hundred years agoÂ…. The movie created - predictably - some controversy. Some criticized the fictional character of Hans, but I think he provided a much needed masculine but discreet performance, to balance the Einar/Lili character. Vikander is really good in showing the strong mix of emotions Gerda felt during Einar's journey: from amusement to worry, from horror, desperation and rage and finally to support. I did not like much Redmayne as Einar/Lili. Granted it was a difficult part to play, but Redmayne drove me to distraction with his hands movements and his fluttering of eyelashes. Besides, he was not even remotely believable as a woman, just a guy in wig and drags. I am surprised he did not 'attract' more bewildered reactions, especially during the first outing at the big ball in Copenhagen. That anybody there mistook him for a girl is ludicrous.Photography and costumes are very good, especially the choice of the cold, Nordic light and minimalist interiors. However, after the move to Paris, the story does slow down considerably and even more so after the first surgery, when I thought the movie should finish, but there was still a bit to go. A tighter editing and a different male lead would have helped.",6,0,1,12 August 2017
The Irishman," Gangsters should die a violent death
","In an average gangsters movie, one tends to focus on the body count and on the many ways criminals can inflict suffering to each other and people at large.In this one, we follow the reminiscences of geriatric Irish gangster Frank Sheeran. While rotting away alone in a retirement home, Frank thinks about the good old days of his ascent in the mob and especially, his friendship with Hoffa.Light is shed on Kennedy's assassination (yet again) and on Hoffa 'disappearance', even if at this stage few would remember who he was. Sheeran is depicted as a slightly psychopathic killer who somehow managed to save his skin, despite many tricky situations..Being busy killing people here and there and bodyguarding Hoffa, meant that Frank neglected his family, hence the solitary ending, despite having a few daughters.De Niro as Frank, Pacino as Hoffa and Joe Pesci as gangster Bufalino do a good job, as it should be expected. Much has been written about their computer generated 'rejuvenation'. I found it distracting, because their younger versions do not look like them as young people. Think about De Niro in Taxi Driver and it is definitely NOT who you will see in the early sequences of this movie, but a younger version of what De Niro looks like now. Very, very weird.Finally, even knowing that Sheeran was a criminal does nothing to decrease the gloom and sadness of seeing this decrepit man, all alone on a wheelchair, wasting away, forgotten but not forgiven. If ever there was a reminder that crime does not pay, especially if you live too long, this is it. But it does not make for enjoyable entertainment.",6,2,6,13 January 2020
The Fifth Element," Could have been a contender
","Targeted to lovers of Sci-Fi action comics, this could have been a decent film even if the plot is just an average good vs. evil story. However, the visuals are exuberant, with lots of shiny costumes, gadgets and interesting CGI. Besson started writing this script when he was 16, and it is easy to see it had massive appeal to the above mentioned public (young male).In a distant future, Earth is about to be destroyed by evil forces and only the four elements, reunited by a Fifth can save the planet. The Fifth element takes the shape of a female teenage, very sexy despite - or because - her extreme naivety. The Fifth element, under the name of Leeloo is played by Jovovich, at the time a mere 22 yo. Bruce Willis, 20 years older, is Korben Dallas, her 'love interest'.Therein lies one of the movie's problems, cleverly identified as the 'Born Sexy Yesterday' (BSY). The term describes young women, totally naive in the ways of the world, but sexually mature. Missing experience, the first man they meet is irresistible and perfect, because they cannot compare him to anybody else. It is a slightly disturbing fantasy, bordering to pathological territory. In Besson's case, he also likes his BSY extremely skinny, almost anorexic and - obviously - half naked throughout the whole movie.Therefore, half-naked Leeloo and Korben run against the clock to save Earth, pursued by assorted enemies, inclusive of a campy Gary Oldman (evil industrialist Zorg) and evil aliens Mangalores. The camp takes a huge overdrive with the entrance of Ruby Rhod, possibly one of the most annoying (and basically useless) characters of the last 50 years. With the entrance of Rhod, what was a half-way decent adventure, turns into an insufferable, shrilly, silly movie.Not for nothing, both Jovovich and Tucker (playing Rhod) were both nominated for Golden Raspberries. Disappointingly, though, Tucker did not win, even if the award would have been well deserved.",3,1,4,17 December 2019
500 Days of Summer," Young romance at its best
","Bittersweet story about young romance. Young people can fall head over heel for a perfect stranger. Probably it is the hormones and lack of experience coupled with expectations too high. Of course, falling for someone does not guarantee your love will be reciprocated. This is what happens to Tom, a romantic boy, slightly disconnected from reality, who thinks he met the 'one' only to find out she was not. The 'wrong' girl is Summer who - allegedly - does not believe in love, but in practice might be just looking for Mr Right.The story is told in non-linear fashion, which for once enhances the quirky narrative. However, we can easily reconstruct the story, from the day they met - Tom filled with romantic and naive expectations, Summer disconnected from her feelings. When Tom and Summer get together, she feels 'happy' and finds him 'funny', but he is convinced she is Ms Right (no explanation is given about the reason of Tom's obsession that Summer is the 'one').Things fall apart quite abruptly, when Summer gets in a bad mood and dumps Tom after having watched 'The Graduate' together. Summer seems a selfish, immature girl who has no clue about what she wants. She lies to herself and to others. Rather than intentionally evil, she just seems frivolous and uncaring, pursuing her own happiness and disregarding whoever does not satisfy criteria she cannot even define.Tom seems to be a naive victim of literature and music about romantic love. The concept of the 'one' seems to be a torture device for American audiences, who need to be constantly reassured that such a person actually exists. Unfortunate, romantic concepts are purely fictional. Long-lasting relationships are based on more solid ground than physical attraction and common interests ('We both like Magritte and Hopper' gushes Tom enthusiastically, as if this is further proof that Summer is his twin soul).This comedy deals with emotional matters so important for the young in the most charming way and the script, editing and soundtrack are absolutely brilliant.",8,1,1,28 May 2012
Juno," Smug teenager gets pregnant and lives happily ever after
","When this film came out in the midst of Oscar-hype, for about 5 minutes I considered going to the cinema to watch it. However, I have plenty of experience of over-hyped movies being nearly unwatchable. Besides, something about the plot did not ring true and I am not that interested in teenage pregnancy anyway. Eventually, I saw a photo of the scriptwriter, Diablo Cody (never heard of a stupider fake name) wearing leopard print and looking smug and I knew this movie was going to be a turkey.Fast-forward three years, and Juno was on TV. Guess what? I was right. Basically, I hated it because of all the things mentioned separately in other 'hate' reviews and I am grateful to fellow reviewers who pointed out every single annoying aspect of this movie. To summarize them all: 1) Ellen Page is cute and – perhaps – a good actress but incredibly annoying, arrogant and smug; 2) almost every line she delivers rings false (scriptwriting lingo nobody could churn out at that speed); 3) her parents and friends are equally annoying; 4) the soundtrack is abominable. Even if Juno is supposed to like punk rock, our ears are abused by silly, kiddie rock songs, performed by a female singer I'd like to strangle 5) but most of all, if Juno is really that smart, how come she does not know anything about birth control?What else? There is no controversy or debate about teenage pregnancy. The only two weak attempts to give a 'controversial' context are: 1) a stupid-looking, pro-life supporter standing outside an abortion clinic mentioning that 'Foetuses already have fingernails' and convincing Juno to change her mind. FYI: monkeys too, have fingernails. 2) a comment from a ultrasound lab technician, mentioning the fact that teenagers might not be good mothers. Juno step-mum (another arrogant piece of work) verbally assaults the technician declaring that teenagers are actually great mothers, or some similar crap.Finally, if what we hear is actually 'normal' teenage slang (as somebody mentioned) I am not surprised our society is going down the drain, so jaded and conceited these teenagers sound and so unable to control or give good advice their parents seem to be. Not the worst movie of all times, but certainly ranking high in that category.",2,4,10,10 July 2010
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Spying in slow motion
","This movie is set in 1973, but it seems rooted in the Sixties, like a nostalgic period piece about the gold times of Cold War. Photography is bleak and 'dusty'. Not a single bright, saturated colour in sight. Equally bleak are the main characters.The byzantine plot revolves around finding a mole nested at the top of the British Secret Service – code-named the Circus. The mole is very good at covering his tracks, since he receives first hand info from Karla - the elusive head of Soviet intelligence - every time a communist agent decides to escape to the West to spill the beans.The Circus is composed by a bunch of middle-aged, unglamorous spies, who look more like average civil servants than like James Bond. Besides, they all are busy keeping up the appearances while living a life of deception, being it about their sexual preferences, drinking or actually working for the Russians. They all have some little dirty secret.Even Smiley, our agent in the Circus. He is middle aged, silent, not aging gracefully and his wife is sleeping around. After having been forced into retirement by a devious scheme, Smiley is put back in the game to work independently from the Circus.Enters Ricky Tarr, an agent allegedly gone rogue in Istanbul who is actually the key to finding the mole. Tarr is the only sympathetic character in the whole plot and the only one who is not a failure – yet – at living a meaningful life.He is also the only one who speaks at normal speed. Somebody must have heard me complaining about how tiresome it can be to follow fast, long conversations. Here we have the total opposite. Dialogues are next to non-existent.Smileys could easily have found himself at home in the silent movies, as he speaks perhaps four lines of dialogues in the whole movie, except for a long and boring monologue about his meeting with Karla.Unfortunately, lack of compelling dialogue and the slow pace undermine what classic spy movies are about. No suspense is built in any scene, or curiosity about who the mole might be. When the mole is discovered, the anti-climax is complete.Even if 'Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy' may be very realistic about the life of spies during the cold war, the cinematic results are quite disappointing. Not a bad movie, but brace yourself for interminable pauses, unexplained scenes and non-stop zigzagging in the temporal line.",5,0,1,26 February 2012
"I, Tonya"," It should be just about the skating...
","I do not follow any sports, I know nothing about skating and I live in Europe. Yet, even I caught a distant echo of what seems to have been a major US scandal. As a proof of how damaging gutter press can be, the only memory I had of the facts was that Harding physically assaulted one of her competitors.Turns out the 'real' story was a lot more complex than the version I barely recollected. According to this movie, Tonya Harding was the product of a violent environment, with a nightmare of a mother who pushed her into competition from age three. Throughout a history of domestic abuse, Tonya managed to become a great skater and then she fell for the wrong guy, Jeff who - by his own admission, had 'no game whatsoever'. The Tonya-Jeff relationship is the cliche' for codependent-destructive. After countless beatings (from both sides), splitting and reconciliations, the couple went back together for Tonya to get through the 1994 Olympic selections, by proving she had a 'wholesome' family.Unfortunately for her, Jeff had friends as dumb as himself. Jeff tried to 'help' Tonya getting to the Olympics by 'scaring off' her main competitor. It is not clear what the truth about the 'scaring' really is: if it involved the beating or 'only' treating letters. At this stage I think nobody cares anymore if Tonya knew about Jeff's plans.Still, it's hard to believe that people that dumb can actually exist. What I also found terrifying is the relentless media coverage that turned a minor story into a scandal that crossed the Atlantic.Tony was a trashy girl from the wrong part of town, without any social grace, who was considered too embarrassing to represent internationally the US and she made herself an easy target by refusing to mend her ways, mistaking stubbornness for authenticity. Even if I understand that Tonya's life was doomed form the start, I do not see her as a blameless victim, more as an accomplish.In any case, the movie is absolutely brilliant. I loved the fake documentary technique, the music score is pitch-perfect and the main actors are terrific. Janney's Oscar for her role as Tonya's terrible mother was well deserved.",9,1,2,13 January 2019
The Beach," Handsome and shallow
","'The Beach' is a Di Caprio vehicle gone south. This is even more obvious 12 years after its original release. Di Caprio, then a baby-faced, attractive star, fresh from the success of Titanic, plays Richard a handsome backpacker in a postcard-pretty Thailand (minus the shabby hotel) populated by many other attractive youngsters.Given the premises, this could have easily turned into an over-bloated ad for fizzy drinks, but luckily some darkness is infused into the story,via several bizarre plot twists. The first one involves Robert Carlyle, who worked already with Boyle in the glorious Trainspotting.Carlyle's cameo is dark and disturbing. It takes place right at the beginning and it is a sign that all will not be well. The middle part is light-hearted. Richard gets acquainted with a couple of stunning-looking French models (I mean, tourists) and they travel searching for paradise on earth.What they find is a sort of hippie community, living on a hidden beach, next door to a marijuana plantation guarded by armed thugs. Not my idea of paradise, but stillIf we forgot about the ominous signs, now it is time to get our memory refreshed.The hippie colony is run by a weird Tilda Swinton (not a big stretch for her playing weirdo) and her iron fist will bring nothing but misfortune to everybody. Anyway, the hippies are not painted as altruistic and kind. They are more selfish, lazy people running away from responsibilities and their demise is welcomed with a feeling of retribution. The end feels abrupt and much over the top, compared with the relative mildness of the rest of the movie.Overall, Di Caprio already showed strong acting skills, but the whole – thin – plot revolves too much around him and eventually collapses in its shallowness",5,3,6,8 October 2012
Horrible Bosses," Best comedy of the year
","What a pleasant surprise! I went to see this movie mostly because I had my share of horrible bosses in the past and I was intrigues by the trailer. It must be noted that the three male leads are basically unknown in Europe, so it was not their star power to attract me. Neither was the presence of Spacey, Aniston or Farrell, since I am not a fan of any of them.Since it was purely the topic that drew me in, I was very pleased by the plot. It was obviously demented and over the top, but still with a hint of realism. It is easy to argue that when you hate your boss you should find another job. Unfortunately, in times as ours, chances to find a better job are slim, while horrible bosses seem to proliferate. Therefore, it is easy to sympathize with the crazy murder attempts perpetrated by the trio of friends, with the help of their 'murder consultant' (glorious idea, character brilliantly played by Jamie Foxx). In any case, it is clear that these three guys are unable to murder anybody, so I did not see any dark undertone in the comedy. It was a long time since I laughed so much at the cinema and I appreciated almost every joke (from the build-up about Jamie Foxx character's name, to the 'Gregory' development). The only part less funny, was the sex harassment plot, which Aniston played well, and very much against type. Unfortunately, playing women with a sex angle is by far the easiest choice. Choosing a different evil for the female boss, might have been a bolder challenge.",8,0,0,21 August 2011
The Doors," Musically incontinent, chaotic tale of drunkard rock star
","Another bombastic movie from Oliver Stone, notorious director of overlong, violent, chaotic movies. Allegedly, Stone wanted to pay tribute to the Doors, a group that was the soundtrack of his youth. What he ended up doing was bad-mouthing Jim Morrison.In fact, the movie should not even be titled 'The Doors, because it is almost exclusively about Morrison's debauchery and flirting with death. A relatively wealthy and healthy kid, Morrison was permanently tormented (by what?) during his short life, did not appreciate fame and fortune, and ended up as an alcoholic and a junkie.It is well known that Morrison was obsessed by a car crash he witnessed as a child. However, his report of the accident was questioned by his whole family who was travelling with him. None of his relatives saw what Jim mentioned (bodies of Indians lying on the road) and the whole accident was probably just a minor one.This episode is saying a lot about the self-aggrandizing attitude of Jim and his egotism. Not to mention that drunkards and junkies tend to be self-obsessed and boring, even – or maybe even more - when they are rock stars. Morrison's saving graces were his sex appeal and his skill with words. Stone chose to dilute the story of Morrision' self destruction with endless sequences of Kilmer (uncannily looking like Morrison) gyrating on stage, drinking, screwing every woman around and being obnoxious.I am sure nobody would like to put up with that, but at the end of the movie we have a weird scene of the Door splitting up and the other members expressing regret at Morrison's departure to France. I would have been delighted to see him go Finally, his death is treated as a mystery, as if a junkie dying of an overdose would be so mysteriousStrictly for the most die-hard fans, who no doubt will find something likable and/or regret that their hero was presented in such an unflattering fashion.",3,2,6,15 August 2016
The Polar Express," Depressing
","I watched this movie on TV during the Christmas holiday and I found it boring and slightly depressing. Afterwards, out of curiosity, I read some on-line reviews and I was amazed to see that some critics described it as a 'modern classic' which will be watched over and over. By whom? I have no desire to go through another session of watching 'Polar express' ever again. What I did not like about it: 1) the mix of real actors playing one (or more) parts and the half-real, half-cartoon look. It is creepy, even if it allows for some special effects (like the train sliding over ice) which would probably be a lot more expensive if done for a real-real movie. However, movies are not any better just because they are stuffed with special effects. 2) the length. This movie stretches on forever, even if the story is very short: boy discover that Santa exists, because magic train brings him to Santa central. Consequently, one cannot help but notice that most of the adventures are there just to fill time: the ghost, the lost ticket, the carriage that takes the three kids for an unexpected journey through the creepy Santa village, inhabited by the weird elfs... All irrelevant to the final purpose. 3) the believing-in-Santa message. Just why believing in Santa makes you a better person escapes my imagination (unless we want to border into dangerous territory and suggest that believing in anything irrational is better than not believing). Finally, I guess it would have been impossible to do such a movie without the usual 'screaming kids on fast vehicle' scene, which seems to be beloved by the American public. That scene is so incredibly boring, I think I saw it in a million movies and yet it does pop up over and over again. For that scene only I would have disliked this movie that is not as innovative and amazing as some critics described. In fact, the only innovative thing is the creepy technique. The story itself is two lines and the moral is puzzling.",3,2,4,6 January 2008
Black Mass," Creepy cross of Goodfellas with The Departed
","I know Boston only from what I saw in the movies and for sure it does not look like an attractive city.In this take - from a real story - corrupted FBI agent Connelly helps gang leader and childhood friend 'Whitey' to become the boss of all dirty business in Boston.At first reluctant to become a 'rat' - because being a drug-dealing murdered is much more honorable - Whitey decides to use the protection given by the FBI to eliminate all his rivals.Johnny Depp morphed into the glacial Whitey, a balding, blue-eyed psycho. The transformation is so complete that I could hardly believe it was Depp. It is also very distracting, even if Depp is amazingly good.This movie lacks the thrilling suspense of The Departed and the deranged 'cheerfulness' of Goodfellas and it certainly is not a heartwarming tale, but a well executed, realistic story of a despicable characters.PS as a 'happy ending', the corrupted Connelly got a heavy sentence and he's still in prison. Whitey ended up even worse, despite all his years on the run.",5,2,2,14 October 2019
The Town," Glorified gangsters rule
","This movie follows a well-traveled road: weary criminal wants to change life and meet a girl who might push him in the right direction. Obviously, only a 'last job' stands in the way to living happily ever after.So far, nothing unusual. However, despite the fact that the plot did not seem overwhelming innovative, I was quite please with part I and II, but my appreciation dropped during part III. There are a few minor twists in part I and II. For instance, the girl is linked to a crime scene and not so innocent. The criminal is an ex-hero of some sort, but his father is a convict. Again, nothing wildly original here, but enough action and suspense to keep the public interested.That is, if you did not see 'Heat' and do not mind the rip-off scenes and general feeling of the plot.Unfortunately, part III turns a likely story into the realm of science fiction. How is it possible that four men can survive the attack of an army of Special Forces? Aren't those Special Forces trained to aim and shoot, rather than just shoot randomly and hit everything around the villains, except the villains themselves? Ben Affleck is not Michael Mann and he could not pull off a decent ending for his movie. While 'Heat' manages to retain a certain atmosphere, 'The Town' crumbles miserably at the end. Besides not being in the Michael Mann league of directors, Affleck is not even such a great actor, remaining expressionless and dull in all his scenes. Luckily, Jeremy Renner has better acting skills and creates some tension with his crazy, out-of-control, character. Jon Hamm is also good, as a straight FBI man.",5,37,61,4 October 2010
Interstellar," Let's find a new planet to destroy
","Roughly divided in three parts and taking place not too far away in the future, the story follows the adventures of Cooper, NASA ex- astronaut turned farmer. Cooper lives in Dusty Somewhere, USA, with his two children (Murph and Tom) and dad in law. Mankind destroyed Earth ecosystems and our heroes are facing dire consequences.Cooper finds 'by chance' the secret location of the new NASA and he is immediately assigned the very important mission to retrace a bunch of astronauts sent into a wormhole 10 years previously to check some promising planets in another part of the galaxy. End of part one.Part two is about the search. Featuring great images of space travel we follow Cooper and his crew of three down the wormhole. Two crew members are of the disposable type, the other is Amelia, who is in love with one of the astronauts dispatched 10 years previously. As to be expected, the exploration of new planets turns out as risky business.Part three is about Cooper falling into a black hole and finding the fifth dimension, which conveniently allows him to tie a lot of loose knots. Some sort of happy ending ensues, but not the heart-warming type.Much as I like Nolan's films, I found Interstellar the weakest of his production. There are some major plot holes in the script, such as why new NASA does not just call Cooper to guide the new mission instead of waiting for him to 'accidentally' stumble upon the super- secret location.And do you really need to retrieve data from a computer to find out that an icy, rocky planet perhaps is not inducive to growing crops?The whole first part of the movie feels like wasted time, except for establishing the strong bond between Cooper and Murph. Then we get some cringe-inducing dialog about love, gravity and relativity and constant harping on about the fact that children are our future. I guess this was a personal theme for new dad Nolan, but it boils down to showing what a bright child Murph is, while Tom – also part of humankind future – is nothing more than annoying.Finally, we are shown three new planets, all menacing and uninviting as possible 'home' for mankind and simultaneously we see how low people can get just to save their skin. Not the most promising scenario for any planet facing abuse and misuse thanks to humankind massive migration.",5,2,5,9 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Vietnam does not look like the UK
","It should be widely known that Kubrick movies are not to be enjoyed, but endured. As a 'cinephile' my choice was to endure them only once, just to know what one of the most overrated directors in the history of cinema was up to. I duly watched FMJ at the time of its original release and did not enjoy it. Back then it felt like a late arrival, saying nothing new after Apocalypse Now and Platoon. Devoid of the emotional impact of those two other movies, dry, slow-paced and boring.Last night, I stumbled upon it on TV and out of curiosity I decided to give it another try, should my previous impression been marred by youthful ignorance. Alas not... In fact, years of movie-watching just enhanced my dislike for what looks more than ever like an half-baked, over simplistic war movie.As everybody knows, FMJ is basically two movies stuck together, with little relation to each other. The first half takes place during a brutal boot camp, with lots of shouting and humiliation from a sadist drill sergeant, leading to 'tragic events' of some sort. The second half takes place in Great Britain, standing for Vietnam and failing miserably at the task.In no way the cold, gray UK could be mistaken for a sub-tropical country. In FMJ the actors keep their long sleeves down, no sticky heat, profuse sweating or ventilators flapping. Besides being infamous for its fake, chilling location, the second part is almost ludicrous in every other aspect. From the dialogs, which sound like a parody of macho war movies, but are in no way funny, to character non-development, to sexist use of local prostitutes - not once, but twice.We are shown twice what is basically the same scene (and the only female presence in the movie): a young Viet prostitute soliciting Joker and friends. Same scene some 15 minutes later, only this time the prostitute is pimped out by a local guy.I could ask many questions about this movie For instance if Kubrick was supposed to be over-meticulous and detail crazy how did he missed the fact that the UK does not look like Vietnam? How did he missed the fact that he had the same scene twice? etc...In the poster's photo we have a helmet with 'Born to kill' scribbled next to a peace sign, signifying the duplicity of human nature. This convey the full message you should get at the end of the movie, so you can spare yourself some time just taking a good look at the poster. If you want to add an additional layer of 'meaning', perhaps you can infer that mankind (in the shape of main character Joker) is 'naturally' good but can be trained to become 'bad'. Hardly a brand-new, mind-blowing concept.",4,6,9,8 October 2012
American Hustle," Overlong, unfocused and murky
","The very messy plot should be about a convoluted scam played by a couple of swindlers, 'forced' to work for the FBI. The swindlers happen to be Irving (Bale) and Sydney (Adams), also involved in a torrid extramarital affair. Irving is married to Rosalyn (Lawrence) a single mum, whose son he adopted. Like most married men, he stalling divorce because the 'child would suffer'.Irving and Sydney get busted by Richie (Cooper) an ambitious FBI agent who forces them to get bigger fish into the agency net. Or, at least this should be the plot, because it gets derailed in all directions, none of which even remotely interesting.It feels like the whole movie is a scam played on the audience, starting with Lawrence. I understand that she is the present 'Hollywood-IT-hot' girl, but her part is bloated out of proportion, when her character was at best a marginal one.She is constantly on screen, shouting all her lines and going on endlessly about her relationship with Irving. Who cares? I wanted to see a movie about a hustle, not a dysfunctional couple in action, especially when their dysfunctions are not the core of the plot. We also get plenty of the Sydney-Richie relationship (and again, who cares?) Everybody is exceedingly verbose, and situations that would require at most 30 seconds of screen time drag on for several minutes. Even considered as a 'character study', the movie still does not work. Besides, the 'moral' of the story is a murky one and an additional joke played on the audience: whoever makes more money (regardless of their methods) is smarter than anybody holding an honest job.Corrupted politicians are portrayed as minor offenders, dealing dirty deeds for the good of the community. Richie is played as a fool, while mediocre Irving and Sydney are glorified as first-class tricksters. Even dumb and insufferable Rosalyn gets a happy ending of her own.The best thing about American Hustle is the 70's atmosphere, with some amazingly tacky clothes and a good soundtrack, but it is definitely not enough to save the movie. Unbelievable to think this mess got 10 Oscars nominations",3,8,14,16 February 2014
The Aviator," Possibly one of the worst Scorsese ever
","The fact that Hughes was an intriguing character who lived a mysterious and glamorous life in the golden age of Hollywood does not translate into an exciting movie.Among the many problems:<ul><li>the total lack of structure. Seems like there is no screenplay and the passage from one scene to the other is totally random.</li><li>the flat dialogue. See Hughes and Brewster's dinner scene as a good example of tedious exchange of words.</li><li>the absurd idea that Beckinsale could in any way be a good choice for Ava Gardner. Beckinsale not only does not posses any glamour and style, but also has no physically resemblance whatsoever.</li><li>ditto for Gwen Stefani, totally miscasted as Harlow</li><li>the overlong scenes with Hughes being obsessive-compulsive, intruding with what should be the main plot.</li><li>the problem of not knowing what exactly should have been the main plot ;-) Was it Hughes as a ladies' man?

Or maybe the development of civil aviation in the US?</li></ul>Way too many threads, all undercooked and meshed up in this messy recipe.",3,7,12,7 April 2019
Oblivion," Strangely compelling and deceptive movie
","Cruise is Jack, one of the few survivors of the interstellar war that decimated Earth's population. The earthlings won, but the planet is severely damaged and what remains of the population is moving to one of Saturn's moons.Jack is a drone repairman, keeping an eye on Earth's water reserve, while Victoria, the other half of a personal and business partnership, guides his missions around the planet. Somewhere in space, 'Control', manned by Sally, keeps an eye on them. Even if their memories were wiped up prior to the mission, Jack keeps dreaming of life on Earth before the war and, more specifically, his life with a mysterious woman.Two weeks before the end of Jack and Victoria's mission on Earth, something happens. An old spacecraft falls to Earth and Jack discovers the mysterious woman hibernated inside. Turns out, things did not quite go the way Jack thinks.I really liked this strangely compelling and deceptive movie. The eerie landscaped of the post- apocalyptic Earth is unforgettable, not to mention the amazing, futuristic house in the clouds. Once you see that, you might wish you could live in one and fly around in mini-copters. Cruise shows a human side and the love story is quite touching (albeit slightly overdone). There are some minor incongruous points, but after all, this is Sci-Fi.",8,3,3,9 March 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Entertainment with a soul
","This movie does not need another review, but I enjoyed myself so much that I wanted to post my little tribute.The plot is encased between the beginning and the end of Queen's show at Live Aid and it tells 15 years of their story. The costumes, settings, etc... inclusive of 70s awful hairstyles, are impeccable.Malek does a great job as Mercury. Of course, he could not be expected to do the singing, but that does not impact the movie a bit. Some scenes are quite moving and thankfully, they do not dwell too deeply into Mercury's sexuality. We all know how that worked out... no need for cautionary tales.The movie is not the glorification of a gay icon, but of the story of a human being, with all the luggage, problems, loneliness, happines and despair that are part of everybody's life. Maybe that's why it touched people's hearts.",9,3,5,5 November 2018
Bridge of Spies," The real title should be 'Tom Hanks is a hero, once more'
","If you expect to see much spying or bridges in this movie you will be sorely disappointed. The plot is about ace lawyer Tom Hanks (his screen name does not really matter, since the movie is just star performance) who is going to prove how good he is, both to the Russians and the East-Germans.A rather puffy-faced Hanks is in most scenes, playing a smug and arrogant lawyer, who always gets the last word and whatever he wants. His performance as a the lawyer is rather overbearing and even slightly unpleasant, but the public still liked him a lot and laughed at all his one-liners (again, star performance, rather than good plot or script).The spies or would-be spies featured in the movie are: 1) a sour little man, who speaks with what sounded to me an Irish accents and who was supposed to be funny with his unflappability. He repeats 'Would it help if I worry?' countless times, every time getting a laugh 2) a rather dumb American pilot and 3) another sort of heroic American student, getting mixed up with foreign politics, when he'd better stayed at home. They all seem to be just props to give Hanks a chance to shine.The moral of the story should be that all countries should be better off minding their own business. However, this sound unrealistic, so the moral is that American heroes (especially Tom Hanks) always save the day. Mind the overbearing soundtrack that seems to come straight out 'Saving private Ryan'",1,48,81,31 December 2015
Cold Mountain," Depressing tale in frozen scenario
","Much has been said about the implausibility of the romance between the Jude Law and the Nicole Kidman characters, but personally I do not find their idealistic passion unbelievable. Actually, the fact that they barely know each other adds to the credibility of their long-term, long-distance relationship. Love at first sight does occur, and mad passion usually burns in the early stages of a relationship, when one does not know the other well. Then you have mystery fueled by desire, hope and expectations.Therefore I do not object to Inman and Ada passion. What I object to, is the fact that Ada is quite too old to be taken seriously as a passionate virgin. When Kidman played this part she was 36, which is more the age for a mature spinster. Besides, Jude Law is five years younger than Kidman and it does show. Basically, I wonder why the part of Ada did not go to a younger actress. Kidman looks fantastic for her age and she is a beautiful woman, but this part called for a girl. Portman, who has a supporting role, would have been perfect for the lead.Another thing I object to is the artificiality of the whole set-up. This movie is corny sentimental while trying to sell itself as a great tragedy. Each situation is blatantly staged for maximum cheap thrills; from the opening battle, carefully shot so as to generate horror and disgust and to convey the idea that war is unreasonable, to the sadistic torturing and killing of Ada's neighbor family, to the obligatory sex scene between the two leads, artfully shot, so as to show parts of their tonic bodies floating in honey-colored light.Minghella is pressing hard to make us reach for the handkerchiefs, but his Ada is no Scarlet O'Hara, and the final result is gloomy and depressing rather than heartbreaking. The movie sits stills in its frozen scenario, the only warmth coming from Renee Zelwegger, who deservedly got an Oscar for her performance.",4,4,7,17 November 2006
Silver Linings Playbook," Two lost souls and a lot of football
","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is just out of a psychiatric institution, after eight months of 'treatment' for violent behaviour and assault on his ex-wife's lover. He lost his job and his home and he is forced to move in with his parents.Tiffany (Lawrence) is a young widow, stricken by grief after her husband's death, who turned to compulsively sleeping around. The fact that Lawrence plays a part written for a woman over thirty undermines her credibility, but not her capability to deliver.They meet not-so-cute at a dinner organised by Tiffany's sister and from then on the plot creeps along, following their tentative relationship. It does not help that Pat's father, played by De Niro, is a bookmaker obsessed with football.Way too much screen time is dedicated to this sub-plot and if you do not care about football - like me - you might find the second part quite tedious, with all the betting and games. Maybe without that and with a tighter editing, it could have been a decent movie... still not Oscar-worthy, but Cooper and Lawrence have some chemistry and their characters are marginally endearing.On a general note, even if Pat is generically described as 'bipolar' and Tiffany as 'borderline' they seemed just two people who found it difficult coping with traumatic events - which does not imply any serious mental illness. I found it weird that in our society, reacting in violent or unpredictable ways to the blows of life, is apparently considered as 'mental illness'...",4,0,2,10 April 2019
Divergent," Yet another teenage dystopian fairy-tale
","Our teenage female heroine is Tris. Like most adolescents she needs to be part of a group, establishing at the same time that she is much superior to her peers.In her society people are conveniently divided in 5 factions (actually, 6), according to virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite (plus the factionless, the pariah of the new society). At a certain age, teenagers must decide which faction to join, regardless of the faction of origin. They are previously tested to establish their main trait and make a better choice about the faction to choose.Choices outside their birth faction are frowned upon, but still allow for the protection of belonging to faction. Not so easy for Tris. She is 'special', therefore a threat to society because she thinks 'independently' - whatever that means.Those like her are called 'Divergent' and are the object of a secret witch hunt. So Tris must succeed her initiation in the adult world, while hiding her true self. It could have been a mildly interesting story, but there are too many problems, both with the plot and the filming. What of the factionless? Are they also divergent or just lazy misfits? Why nobody seems to care about this main issue of their society? Isn't the elimination of the 'divergents' too radical a way to deal with an alleged problem?Finally, instead of developing a comprehensive plot, half of this very long movie is devoted to Tris' initiation into the Dauntless faction. Scene after scene are about her tests and trials moving the plot nowhere, except for the introduction of a dumb love story.Targeted to the same audience of The Hunger Game, this is yet another movie that made me check the time more than once. It drags along forever and the ending is so open and silly that one can hear it screaming out loud for a sequel.",2,3,5,1 April 2017
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Serial killers should stop using Bible references
","It is difficult to review a movie with such a dense narrative and multi-layered references. As almost everybody knows, the story is based on a best-selling trilogy of novels, written by a Swedish journalist. Based on the novels, Swedish TV produced a mini-series of six episodes.I saw the whole thing and was underwhelmed. Enough to put me off from reading the novels. Theoretically, the author aimed at glorifying his strong heroine, Lisbeth Salander, who manages to thrive despite the physical and mental violence she has to endure. In the Swedish series, Lisbeth comes across as an unpleasant weirdo bent on revenge (even if most rightfully so) and not so much as a role-model for battered women.This movie summarizes what in the Swedish series is two longish episodes. Inevitably, much had to be cut off. Unfortunately, I doubt I could have followed the movie without having previously watched the series.The first part of this long story deals with introducing unorthodox leading lady Lisbeth and her partner, disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Their meeting is catalyzed by a weird investigation on a missing girl. Unfortunately, this investigation is not much more than a rehash of the 'closed room' investigations from many thrillers of the past. To make things more 'modern' we have rape and serial killers thrown in in what is a very trivial background.Forty years before the beginning of our story, a young girl named Harriet Vanger, disappears from a small island. The island belongs to the Vanger family, each and every member being on it the day of her disappearance, to increase the number of suspects. Her uncle Henrik seems to be the only one upset by her disappearance, but he still waits quite a long time before reopening the case.Henrik Vanger assigns the investigation to Mikael, after having had his background researched by the company that employs Lisbeth as an 'investigator' and hacker. In turn, Mikael asks for Lisbeth help to solve the alleged murder mystery.The mystery revolves around the' usual' serial killer who goes around leaving clues based on the Bible. I lost count on how many times I saw an investigator solving a case by 'finally' deciphering obscure numerical clues by cross-checking the Bible. This is sloppy narrative. Unfortunately, also the other main point of the movie – the battles of fierce Lisbeth against abusing men – is equally disappointing.Compared to its Swedish counterpart, this American version is much more opulent and visually brilliant. Interiors and exteriors are sleek, polished and expensive-looking. Both main characters are played by actors a lot better looking than the Swedish ones. However, they lack credibility. The Lisbeth played by Rooney Mara is accurately styled as a post-punk heroine, wearing trendy clothes and jewelery. The one played by Swedish Rapace, was more a Joan Jet of the poor, looking disheveled and not styled at all.I am sure many will appreciate this movie as a stand-alone thriller, because of its sleek visuals and recognizable basic plot (the Bible serial killer), missing completely the intricacies, plot twists and convoluted heaviness of the whole series.",4,9,18,5 February 2012
Dreamgirls," Overlong, old-fashioned, boring
","Like many others, I was fooled by the rave reviews and claims that this was even better than 'Chicago'. It was not. Actually, I had no idea that the musical the film is based on has been around for so long. I wonder how it managed, because there is not a single memorable song in the whole show. As somebody else remarked, the movie starts quite well, with some decent R&B songs, but quickly turns into a series of pop songs of very mediocre quality, which sound one very much like the other (i.e. second-rate). A professional movie critic hailed the central song, titled something like 'I am not leaving' as a sort of masterpiece, but I was just looking forward for Ms. Hudson to shut her mouth, as she seemed to go on forever screaming at the top of her lungs. Very old-style Broadway showbiz. The sort of singing style I am uncomfortable with.Besides, if you want to believe the movie actually has a plot, this scene was quite nonsensical, as every other member of the cast had made it clear she had to go, so she sounded a bit dim-witted, insisting about something that was already decided. I also think it makes a big difference to watch this movie outside the States. Americans may be intrigued by the pop and movie stars personalities crowding the movie. I just wanted to enjoy a good musical, without particularly caring about any big name attached to it (also because they are not so big in Europe). I was bored by the songs (too many) and the plot is so simplistic that it turned into one of those 'so-bad-it-makes-me-laugh' kind of experiences.Eddie Murphy was embarrassing, posing as Little Richard or whomever, and any other character so two-dimensional that it was impossible to care about whatever was going on.",1,0,2,4 March 2007
Dunkirk," Focussing on the event, not on the characters, with a couple of problems
","We get to see the Dunkirk evacuation from land, air and sea, without getting too attached to any of the characters, which worked fine for me. A WEEK: The land guys are a bunch of soldiers trying repeatedly to get on a boat to England, but ending in worst trouble every time. Some claustrophobic moments in sinking ships are quite uncomfortable. The evacuation lasted a week so we get the feeling of a long wait.ONE DAY: On the sea, we follow the story of one of the many civilians who helped carrying soldiers back to England with their own boats. The two-way journey lasted one day, so the experience was different.ONE HOUR: The RAF pilots add more seasickness opportunities, with their daring manoeuvres to protect their stranded comrades. Their tanks could support one hour of flight, and this is the third, different view point.For the above mentioned reasons, the plot is not edited in chronological order, which was slightly annoying, but there was enough tension to keep the story going without a dull moment. If you like character-driven stories you will not like this, but I appreciated the lack of personal stories and the focus on the general, dismal feeling of defeat.Two small problems: the beach was too quiet, with relatively few soldiers waiting for a ride home. Over 300.000 soldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk, but we see at most a few hundreds waiting on the beach. Finally, the soundtrack was overbearing. It is clear it was a dramatic event without the need to have it hammered home with the hyper- dramatic, anxiety-inducing music.PS I know Nolan did not want to use CGI, but in this case some extra men on the beach would have added realism, rather than the opposite...",7,4,6,30 July 2017
Control," Torn apart by love and epilepsy
","A story about a tormented young singer committing suicide on the verge of stardom is bound to have a certain appeal. However, the risks of falling into melodramatic or morbid are high. Corbijn avoids both, directing this minor masterpiece with restrain and respect for all those involved.I loved the B&W photography. It recreates the atmosphere of those years, which seem long gone, the bleak but bubbling music scene, and the excitement about the new wave just about to explode. Youth having everything and not realizing how fragile life is.Ian Curtis was a particularly fragile creature, both because of his epilepsy and his problem with communication. A confused boy without guidance, who wrote some of the most depressing lyrics ever, he still has a huge following. Maybe because his anguish is universally understood.I am not a Joy Division fan, nor was I particularly shocked by Ian Curtis early departure. However, this movie is so well made that made listen again to their music. After more than 25 years their songs sound even more claustrophobic and depressing and I wonder how Curtis would have developed as a singer.Had he lived, I doubt he could have transitioned easily into the light-hearted pop atmosphere of the late 80's. By checking out so early he became unforgettable. Even more so, with this sober but poignant movie celebrating his short time on earth.",9,1,1,7 August 2013
Jackie," Good interpreter, horrible storytelling
","This is a good example of why chronological storytelling sometimes is the best option. The film covers a short time-frame, a single week from the assassination of Kennedy to Jackie moving out of the White House after the funeral. To add some 'breathing space', the film is interspersed with images from the documentary of the 'guided tour' of the White House made by Jackie in 1962. To establish and maintain a proper mood, the story could have followed the events, opening with a short introduction from the first happy days of the presidency, to the making of the documentary. The landing in Dallas, the shock of the assassination, and the nightmarish week of the funeral would have made Jackie's fall from the grace even more poignant.The film could have been wrapped up by the interview she gave a week after JFK funeral, when she regained a glacial composure. What we have instead is the interview opening the film, with a snobbish Jackie icily answering impertinent questions from a report she herself invited, followed by an endless jumping back and forward in time. Despite of this, the story feels claustrophobic and drags along at snail pace.Further ruining the film are: too many close-ups of Portman's face; a very long scene of Jackie drinking, smoking and popping pills all alone in a chilling White House that resembles the bedroom in '2001: a Space Odyssey'; the overbearing, funereal music to underscore the obvious (an assassination and organizing a funeral are hardly happy occasions) and the useless scenes with the religious counselor. Poor John Hurt is given lines of utter triviality, that offers no comfort at all.It could have been a decent movie, but the editing destroyed it for me. Maybe filmmakers assume that tangled time-lines are the only way to go in contemporary cinema or maybe there is a law I am not aware of against chronological storytelling.",3,0,1,12 February 2017
No Strings Attached," Can't believe Portman is in this
","I always considered Natalie Portman as an outstanding actress and was surprised to see her name linked to Ashton Kutcher, notoriously a lot less outstanding. However, hoping for some light entertainment I decided to watch this movie. Regrettably, it turned out even worse than I expected. Portman plays a doctor who thinks she is tough, but in reality is just a hamster (the only funny joke of the movie). Kutcher plays a mild mannered guy, who has the misfortune of being weighted down by a questionable ex-girlfriend and by a vain, silly father. They both are supported by the usual cohort of unbearable friends who are a fixed showcase of all such comedies. The whole cast is equally intolerable and predictable to the utmost. If I ever saw a paint-by-number movie it has to be this one. Absolutely no way of spoiling it, as it is crystal clear from the start how it will end. I am still recovering from the shock of seeing Portman in this piece of unbearable s**t. But I learned my lesson and from now on I will try my best to avoid all movies with Kutcher in it.",1,46,83,20 May 2011
Enchanted," Lovely clever movie with a great Amy Adams
","The movie's heroine, is Gisella, a Cinderella-like girl who lives in an enchanted land filled with talking animals and princes ready to save a damsel in distress. Just before her wedding to her prince, Giselle is pushed to a place 'without happy endings' by the evil stepmother. Enter an amazingly good Amy Adams as Giselle, ready to face filthy New York with optimism. Other characters follow her from the animated world to the 'real' one and they are all equally amusing.Thanks to James Marsden acting chops, Prince Edward is strangely endearing, with his vacuous smile and silly bravery. Pip the chipmunk is adorable and the baddies of the story are suitable despicable. While Dempsey is suitable as the alternative love interest, Adams is really the heart and should of the movie. The way she moves her hands is impeccably artificial and strangely natural (for an animated character). Everything is perfect in her performance, right down to her arriving to the Kings and Queens ball in modern clothes.This is definitely a feel-good, heartwarming movie with a clever plot brilliantly executed.",8,2,2,7 April 2017
To Rome With Love," Four compressed versions of Allen's other movies
","The four unrelated plots that compose this mess of a movie focus on classic Allen's themes he tackled better many times before.The plot featuring Benigni is a compressed version of 'Celebrity', the Allen movie about the absurdity of contemporary fame-worshipping. Benigni is a most overrated actor/director with a very limited range. His scenes are painful to watch.The story featuring Eisenberg, Gerwig and Page is the standard Allen's fodder of a young man falling for a neurotic/pretentious/unreliable female, in the past the classic Keaton's role. In 'Anything Else' Christina Ricci played the Page role. This story is also annoying and the dialogues bad and repetitive. Comments fly around about how sexy and irresistible the Page character is supposed to be, even if she does not strike me as such...A third story features a young Italian couple acting as if they lived in the 50s. They both are ludicrous but manage to cuckold each other given the first chance. The 'wise' hooker played by Cruz is straight out of 'Deconstructing Harry'.The fourth plot was for me the most unbearable, featuring Allen himself at his most Allenish. Stammering, afraid of death and involved in a stupid plan (see 'Small Time Crooks' and many others), Allen manages to concurrently insult Italian families and operas.Even the soundtrack is atrocious, with some corny Italian tunes from the 50s. The only saving grace is the photography. However, the real Rome is a mess of ugly buildings and traffic, not the golden collection of monuments showed in the movieReally an awful mess that should be voted in the negative.... even without mentioning the overbearing product-placement.",1,3,7,30 May 2017
Bridesmaids," Shallow, hollow and silly unfunny comedy about the dreadful 'wedding' planning
","It is astonishing to think that this piece of shallow silliness got two Oscar nominations. However, it works very well as an indicator of the sorry state of contemporary society. The story revolves around Annie Walker, a most annoying woman who would be a perfect character for a cheap sitcom.Annie alleged best friend Lillian is getting married and that horrendously stressing event that is an American wedding must be organized. Countless chick flicks have been there, only to underline how the true meaning of getting married and any shred of happiness are lost in the process of having so much 'organized' fun.In this case, wedding planning is complicated by the presence of new BFF Helen, a rich, good looking woman who is stealing Annie's thunder. Not that Annie has much thunder. She works as a shop assistant, lives with a grotesque couple (in the movie for no reason whatsoever) and is sabotaging her relationships. Despite all this, some sort of happy ending is on sight.The whole movie is peppered with overlong scenes (Annie on the plane, Annie with flatmates...) scatological language, poop, vomit and vulgarity. Even the late Jill Clayburgh, actress of a certain class, is not spared.This cringe-worthy movie was produced by Apatow and co-written by Kristen Wiig, who is also starring – and appearing in every scene - as main character Annie Walker.If you know a bit about movies, this can explain why it is so bad. Apatow is the king of crass, vulgar, unfunny comedies. Wiig wanted to make clear she is the star. Unfortunately, like most female comedians, she seems to think that the only way to make women 'funny' is to degrade them. Surely they get plenty of humiliations in this movie, but this does not make the movie funny in any way.",1,3,5,19 October 2014
The Favourite," Mixing mainstream with experimental pays with the critics
","Some movies are born to be darlings of the critics. Take 'experimental' director Lanthimos, lately very much in favour, thanks to puzzling movies such as 'The lobster' and give him a script whatsoever. You may bet the critics will applaude the results, perhaps also thanks to the abundance of salacious, politically-correct scenes.Allegedly, this should be a 'nastily funny' historical romp, with focus on the powers struggles at court and between the Whigs and the Tories, but the sex indiscretions are a wink to modern voyeurism and manage to derail the movie.Loosely based on historical facts, compressed and distorted, we spy on Anne queen of England, who after having given birth to 17 children - all of which died in infancy - decides to turn to safer sex and enjoy the intimate company of her best friend, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.We're not given any information about the absence of Anne's husband and her switch from heterosexuality (or any of the background whatsoever).Enter on the scene Abigail, Sarah's poor cousin and the happy couple is torn apart by jealousy and betrayal. Anne is sick, childish, weak, mentally unstable, easily pushed around by any strong woman who may happen to be around. Sarah is harsh, domineering, power-hungry, but perhaps loyal and Abigail is a hypocrite manipulator. Everything is in background, apart from Sarah and Abigail manoeuvring to get close to the queen and getting close means only the most classic love-sex-jealousy plot, only with all female characters.Add lots of profane language and modern mannerisms, strident soundtrack, way too many fish-eye shots and weird angles, anachronistic costumes and what you get is a movie loved by the critics. For me it is just a missed chance, given that the three lead actresses are doing a great job and the plot was compelling enough without the overdose of sex.",3,38,67,13 January 2019
Foxcatcher," Material perhaps better suited to a documentary
","There are some real-life stories that just cannot be made into interesting movies. This is one of them.Labelled as a 'character study', it focuses on Mark and Dave Schultz, two wrestlers, Olympic gold-medal winners and their 'mentor', billionaire John Du Pont.The problem is that the first half of the movie is dominated by Mark and John, two very dry, silent men, with assorted personality disorders. Watching these two moving in chilling, beautiful settings, hardly speaking to each other is not my idea of entertainment.The other two main characters of the movie are John's disapproving mother and Dave, the only outgoing, warm personality.In very sketchy psychological analysis, we should understand that John Du Pont had serious issues with mommy and became a weird, lonely recluse because of that. We should also understand that Mark had issues with big brother Dave (and probably with the whole world at large) and that is why his character is a sullen moron.The soundtrack also takes itself very seriously, so you get the impression of watching a very long wake - and have the same fun.I give one point each to the male leads, who definitely did a great job, but that's as far as it gets. Steve Carell prosthetic nose would be a minus point, but I won't be so stern.",3,1,2,30 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," My favorite Tarantino in a while
","Dreamy and nostalgic, with two great leads, this is a story walking a thin line between reality and 'could have been'.DiCaprio is Rick Dalton, a fictional actor whose time in the limelight is running out. Pitt is his stunt/handyman Cliff Booth. The two share a friendship and wander around in a Hollywood undergoing a disintegration under pressure by the 'youth-quake', the hippies and all the political upheaval of the late 60s.Two lost souls who would have been more at home in the studio system of the preceding decade, Dalton and Booth try to fit in and stay relevant, fail and eventually move to CinecittÃ  for some spaghetti westerns.Back in Hollywood, they get mixed up with hot and upcoming neighbour couple Tate/Polanski and with some nasty hippies.As in 'Inglorious Basterds' the mix of reality and fantasy works out quite well. No major violent scenes, except towards the end, but even there, not what you would expect.",8,3,9,14 January 2020
Gone Girl," If you are blonde and beautiful the police will believe everything you say
","Gone Girl is based on convoluted premise: a psychotic plot to frame somebody for your murder. This deranged idea is not popular for movie plots and could have been worth exploring. It was developed much better in the great film noir 'Leave her to heaven', where the framing was done in a subtler way. But we do not live in subtle times, so here we get plenty of gore and graphic violence.For the few who still do not know the plot, the story is about unhappy couple Amy and Nick. Ben Affleck, woody and expressionless as usual, is creepy Nick the unfaithful husband. During the first half hour he is - quite convincingly - the main suspect for the disappearance of Amy.Beautiful Rosamund Pike is psycho crazy wife Amy, a woman with a demented agenda and several loose screws. She manipulates every man she meets. At the end of the movie, even FBI detectives are more than happy not to open an investigation on her crimes, just because she is a beautiful blonde and they believe everything she said.Amy's plotting is given away much too soon in the movie, so we spend two very long hours just following around the demented blonde while Nick gets in big trouble, only for Amy to resurface and deciding to spend the rest of her life with the husband she wanted to see executed.Does it make much sense? Apparently yes, since critics (and lots of IMDb users) loved it.",1,6,9,16 February 2015
Mr. Nobody," Whatever you choose, it will probably turn out not OK
","Nemo is a boy born with a peculiarity: he can 'remember' the future, because the angels of birth forgot to reset his mind. Apparently all 'about-to-be-born' babies can also select their parents and Nemo picks a couple that seems reasonably nice. Unfortunately, when Nemo is in his early teens, mum and dad separate and Nemo must decide which one to pick. Life with mummy seems the best option because in his teenage years Nemo gets to live with Anna, the love of his life (and the daughter of his mummy's boyfriend). Life with dad is more unpleasant, but Nemo gets the chance to explore romance with Elise (love n.2) and Jean (the rebound option). The moral of the story could be that whatever decision you take, your life will still be far from perfect. What seems to work out one moment falls apart the next and viceversa.Added to the multiple options plot, is the cosmic twist of the Big Crunch, a scientific theory according to which the universe will stop expanding and start shrinking and time will reverse. Obviously, Nemo knows when this will happen, so he tries to keep alive as long as possible just to re-live all his lives.Aa much as the story is quirky, unusual and interesting, it is also deeply flawed:<ul><li>Nemo's very long life seems to revolve only around his teenage and early thirties years - The romance with Anna takes an awfully long screen time, especially the teenage years, but also the various developments of the possible story lines, making it very soppy - The side story with Jean takes additional time and seems unnecessary - The main plot of multiple choices was already intriguing enough, without the Big Crunch twist</li></ul>I usually like quirky movies that deal with identity and memory and I thought Mr. Nobody was the sure deal. However, after almost two hours the story started to drag. A tighter editing, a slightly simpler plot or a little less romanticism would have made it memorable.",6,0,0,9 March 2017
Drive," Stuck in second gear
","I am always suspicious of movies with nameless characters. It seems an unnecessary contrivance. Unfortunately, 'Drive' proves no exception, by adding this annoying detail to a slightly schizophrenic plot. Our anonymous hero, played by Gosling, is a stuntman by day and a driver of heist cars by night. Complications ensue when he falls for his neighbor Irene, a young mother with a criminal husband.Our driving hero is moved by love into protecting Irene and her child, so he gets involved into a spiral of violence. At this stage 'Drive' could have taken a turn as a romantic movie or taken the pulp fiction route. Unfortunately, it does not develop fully in either direction.The romancing angle is played subtly and delicately. After having watched a couple of Gosling's movies and disliked him intensely, I actually liked him for the first time. He plays remarkably well the star-crossed lover.The violent part is an unbelievable mess. Turns out that there is only one criminal organization in all L.A. and all our characters are mixed up with it. The gentle driver turns into a bloodthirsty creature and physical elimination of all members of the cast ensues â€“ needless to say, in the most graphic manner. Of the seven main characters (+child) only two make it to the end of the movie. Not difficult to guess who; however, do not expect a 'happy ending'.Besides the above mentioned 'split-personality', 'Drive' suffers from other problems: 1. Our driving hero is a bland cypher, a mildly likable guy, not a super-cool hero of Steve McQueen proportions. His long silences and mysterious aura are just annoying 2. The plot moves at snail's pace. Although I am not a fan of fast editing and deafening soundtracks, here we are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Long silences, pauses and minimal dialogs sold for 'intensity' 3. The soundtrack is abominable. A mood-destroying collection of easily forgettable, third-rate songs. I sorely missed the witty dialogs and the brilliant score of Tarantino's movies 4. Finally, 'Drive' takes itself very, very seriously, so forget fun. Sometimes when I watch a movie like this I wonder if it is the same one so many critics are raving about. How many movies titled 'Drive' starring Ryan Goslings are currently out there? Because for sure, the one I watched does not seem to deserve much praise. Not bad, but a masterpiece it ain't.",5,0,2,26 February 2012
The Lives of Others," Moving and melancholic
","One of the best movies on the subject of loyalty (to loved ones or ideals) and betrayal. Set in East Berlin a few years before the fall of the Wall.People on the wrong side of the Wall still live like in the 60s, very few lights at night and cars around in bleak East Berlin. The gloomy atmosphere is compounded by the dreaded surveillance by the STASI, of which we meet rising operative star Gerd.Thanks to his friendship with a higher ranking official, Gerd gets the prestigious job of spying on playwright Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Sieland. The excuse is that Dreyman is suspected to be a Western sympathiser, even if everything he writes is above board.The truth is that fat, ugly and nasty culture minister Hempf is shagging his girlfriend and wants to get rid of the competition.Soon, the dry, introverted Gerd starts to have feelings for the couple and tampers with his reports. Unfortunately, Dreyman and Sieland manage to get into big trouble. Being a fragile, abused woman, Sieland is the first to go down. In a scene comparable to Winston's betrayal of Julia in 1984, Sieland spills some beans.Will she survive as a STASI informer? Will her beloved Dreyman suffer dreadful consequences? Will Gerd be able to help the couple? The bitter-sweet ending is one of the most perfect wrapping up of such gripping narrative . Excellent, highly recommend movie.",9,0,0,10 November 2019
School of Rock," Creepy freeloader and children are not a good mix for a rock band
","Jack Black is one of those actors who always play slight variations of themselves. He could be described as a character actor or less nicely, an actor with not much of a range.Not surprisingly, in this movie he is an obnoxious, selfish, immature guy who sings in a low-level band and exploits an old friend for free lodgings. When the girlfriend of said friend asks him to pay the rent, he resentfully set out to find a job. Said girlfriend portrayed as an unpleasant bitch, only because she makes a reasonable request...Through a series of implausible events Jack (apologies, I mean Dewey) ends up teaching rock to a bunch of kids in a posh school. Not because he likes teaching but because he needs them to be his 'support band' for the battle of the bands, since no legitimate rock band would have him.It is quite creepy to hear a grown-up man telling pre-pubescent girls they could be groupies, not to mention the manipulation of kids for his own purpose. At the end Jack (I mean Dewey) acknowledges that the band is more important than any single member, but throughout the movie we see him in every single scene playing the only 'cool' character among a bunch of boring, nasty, square people of all ages.Besides Black being totally predictable, the screenplay is even more so. Finally, for a comedy there are very few real funny moments. The only saving grace is the music, with a totally unexpected bit from Led Zeppelin exploding in a scene.For die-hard Black's fans and people who think being a freeloader is a cool way to live. P.S. also probably the worst Linklater film.",3,6,14,20 November 2016
1917," Remarkable war movie
","The storyline about delivering an important message to avoid a massacre is deceptively simple. Blake and Scholfield, two corporals, must go through dangerous territory to reach the battalion where Blake's brother is serving, to avoid 1600 soldiers falling into a German trap.The two embark into a nightmarish mission, during which they both will prove to be outstanding human beings.The tension is palpable throughout their journey, and since they're both nice people, you really feel for them and hope they're going to make it. Nowadays it is increasingly rare to see sympathetic main characters on screen. For that reason only, this movie is a step ahead of all the pretentious ones that patronise their audience.Besides, even if the devastating effects of war are visible and plenty of corpses are scattered on the battlefield, the camera never lingers for cheap shots of horrifying, voyeuristic thrills. Again, a major difference with lots of other war and crime movies.Really hoping that for once and after years of delivering Oscars to politically correct mush, this one will win the well deserved prize.",9,0,3,2 February 2020
Sing Street," Heart-warming movie with a couple of minor problems
","Conor is 15, his parents have a rocky relationship and money problems, his older brother Brendan is a college drop-out, his sister has no reason to be in the movie.Conor is sent to a Catholic school to save money and there he sees and falls in love with Raphina, an older girl. Raphina is supposed to be 16, but the actress playing her is 22, while the actor playing Conor is actually 15 and 7 years is a wide age gap. Skipping the age problem, to win over Raphina, Conor starts a school band with a motley crew just to ask her to appear in his band's videos.This is Dublin in 1985, Duran Duran are at the height of their power and the video for the their song Rio is Conor first - but not last - inspiration.It is hilarious to see Conor during his creative process and how his clothes and music are influenced by several bands (The Smiths, Spandau Ballet, etc...) It is easy to relate to that period in life when we are not sure about ourselves and try out different images.Conor writes some good songs in different styles and experiences the pains of growing up when his parents separate, but at least he can count on Brendan to give advice about music and women.The core of the plot is the love story, narrated via the original songs and developed in a sweet way. Peppered with humor, excellent costumes and engaging characters, the movie will make most of those who grew up in the 80s feel nostalgic.Just a couple of minor problems for me: even if U2 were an Irish band exploding in mid 80s, they are not even acknowledged (maybe for copyright reasons?). Finally, unless one is an hopeless romantic or still a teenager, it is difficult not to imagine much disappointment in Conor and Raphina's future.",8,1,2,7 December 2016
Mulholland Drive," Naked chicks get you high ratings
","When I first watched the movie in 2001 I was still hoping Lynch had something to say, despite the disappointment with Wild at heart. I was surprised by the high rating and good reviews this movie got, but finally when I watched the movie again tonight on TV I got the point: hot, young, naked actresses and plenty of lesbian sex. Watts and Harring starring as the mysterious Rita and Betty go all the way, titillating the viewers with their antics.Undeniably, both Watts and Harring really did a good job with the absurd script they got. But the script remains absurd. My personal take is that Lynch had a grudge against the Hollywood establishment and the whole movie is supposed to prove some point, such as how directors are forced to choose actors, even when they would prefer to cast somebody else.It is pointless to summarize the plot, since the movie switches into a different one two thirds into the story. Anybody can interpret the complete lack of logic in whichever way they want and then 'accuse' whoever does not 'get' it of being dumb. The point is, there is nothing to 'get', apart from Lynch frustration, unleashed on paying audience, a plot that does not make any sense and a couple of good actresses, only one of them actually making a career out of this crappy movie.While Mulholland Drive propelled Watts into super stardom, Harring was left behind. Which seems unfair, but then again, perhaps fitting in Lynch's world where nothing makes sense. However, Mulholland Drive put me off Lynch's world once and for all.P.S. I like fictional stories to make some sort of sense, since I get plenty of absurdity from real life. I think authors could make an effort to churn out stories with a beginning a middle and an end, even if not necessarily in this order. Creativity does not necessarily imply messy, self-involved narrative.",1,2,12,9 November 2014

The core of the movie is the cracking of Enigma with some flash back to Turing youth and flash forward to Turing last year (actually, the movie starts in the 50s and then jumps back to the war years – a completely useless editing idea).Altogether not a bad story and certainly a great Cumberbatch and Knightley interpretation. The supporting actors are also good and there is some moment of British humor to lighten the atmosphere. The only thing I find objectionable is that the movie gives the idea that Turing was the only one who actually cracked the code. The solitary genius who did it all on his own and even against his own team - with the exception of the Knightley character.All this to put Turing on an even higher pedestal and to underline that he was such as genius AND gay. Basically gay = genius in this movie. Which seems rather far-fetched, because it surely is a fact that not all gay people are geniuses, just like not all straight people are The again, the 'solitary' hero is a concept a lot more fascinating than 'team work'.",7,1,6,25 January 2015
The Piano," Never trust a child
","Jane Campion likes the grotesque. In most of her movies some characters are distinctively weird in looks and behavior. The Piano is no exception. Main character Ada, played ferociously by Holly Hunter, is a bit of a freak. Stubborn and self-contained she 'decided' to remain silent from age six and never spoke a word since.She also managed to produce obnoxious child Flora out of wedlock, so her father is packing her of from Scotland to New Zealand, where she will get married to Alisdair. The official story is that she is a widow. These are Victorian times, so there is nothing strange in sending Ada to the antipodes to cover up for her indiscretions.Once in New Zealand, Ada continues to make trouble, starting a reluctant affair with Alisdair's neighbor, George (Keitel, in another naked role). The fact is, Ada loves only her piano (her 'voice') and Alisdair decided to leave it on the beach where she disembarked, while George decided to have it transported to his hut.Considering miles of uphill trekking on muddy ground, Alisdair's decision does not seem so unreasonable, but Ada dislikes him for this. Sullen and cold, Ada is sending conflicting messages to those around her. First she is shocked by George's fondling, then she is intrigued. Unfortunately, creepy Flora gets jealous, also shifting her alliance, but from Ada to Alisdair. Her action brings the movie to its climax. A sort of puzzling happy ending shows Ada insisting to have the piano dropped in the sea and attempting suicide, for reasons hard to understand. Some beautiful landscapes and hunting music hardly make up for the fact that most of the movie is shot in claustrophobic and dark rain forest and three out of four main characters are creepily weird.",5,2,5,25 October 2014
The Adjustment Bureau," The master plan is confused
","The bureau of the title is helping wretched humankind, by performing seemingly trivial adjustments in daily events, which should steer us gently towards some unidentified superior purpose. It is an intriguing premise, but unfortunately it goes pretty much nowhere.The plot could have developed by investigating further the nature of the adjustments and the ripples they create, or on what free will is actually about and why humankind is not yet capable to handle it.Instead, it develops the idea that love at first sight do exists and so does that elusive 'other half' we need to find to feel finally whole. Both concepts are very romantic but difficult to sell to a grown-up (or just cynical) audience.Matt Damon plays David, who could have a great future and a positive influence on mankind (or at least on the US), but keeps deviating from this nobler and higher purpose because of Elise– a flirty ballerina he met in the gents room (not the most romantic location).Throughout the movie I kept thinking that Elise kept popping up at the worst possible time and considered her more as disturbance rather than the romantic interest, which is a clear sign I did not buy into the star-crossed lovers' side of the story.What I appreciated was the minimal special effects and Damon's performance, but I still consider - with regret -this movie a miss, despite the huge potential.P.S. and in real life, people who fall asleep on the job usually get fired, not promoted.",5,8,16,22 March 2011
Prisoners," Definitely went too far
","Jackman plays Keller Dover, a bully with a family and some friends. On Thanksgiving, the Dover and the Birch families meet for lunch and in the afternoon both their younger children disappear.Enter detective Loki, played by Gyllenhaal and the hunt for the filthy kidnapper starts with the lengthy interrogation of suspect number one, Alex Jones. Alex is suitably creepy and with a shady past, but is that enough to make him a child abuser?Drenched in the cold light of the winter season, with plenty of rain and snow, the movie manages to maintain a tense rhythm just about three quarters of the way. Then it collapses due to several problems:<ul><li>none of the main characters seems able to articulate their thoughts. A movie with one, strong silent type is OK, but here just about everybody (strong or otherwise) is extremely silent, even when keeping their mouth shut results only in getting additional beatings</li></ul><ul><li>the Dover character, being an anguished father should attract some sympathy, but he is just a bully, determined to beat his way to the truth. A bully with a family is still a bully and the extreme violence Dover is capable of is not justified by the circumstances</li></ul><ul><li>the 'investigation' seems to be carried out by a single man. Detective Loki puts himself in dangerous situations without any back-up or contact with headquarters. Seems stupid and I doubt a real detective would risk that much</li></ul><ul><li>the token pedophile priest is one of the semi-red herring sub plots that has been done way too often.

Friends with Benefits," Paint by number
","It is very difficult to do romantic comedy in a post-romantic, post-everything era. Even without a clue about the plot, you can easily imagine each turn of the way.Start with meet-cute, which must be OTT unrealistic. Continue with super snappy dialogues between the two main characters, add a couple of crazy but adorable parents.Top everything with plenty of nudity and congratulate both Mr. Timberlake and Ms, Kunis on their magnificent, perfectly toned, healthy young bodies.... but a comedy with a heart... not so much.",2,0,1,10 February 2020
Chariots of Fire," Memorable opening scene and soundtrack
","After all these years the opening sequence of 'Chariots of fire' is still one of the most memorable in the history of movies. A celebration of life and youth, the 'simple' pleasure of being alive and running barefoot on the beach and the wonderful soundtrack enhancing the moment.The plot is about Abrahams and Liddell, two very different English athletes who competed in the 1924 Paris Olympic games.Abrahams is a Jew and a bit of a whiner. Allegedly 'discriminated' because of his religion, Abrahams is rich, studying at one of the most exclusive universities of the country and on the verge of Olympic immortality. Hardly heavy burdens to bear. Liddell is a Scottish missionary, born in China and ready to go back but not before competing in Paris.Not being into sports, I found the film well-made, but slightly too long. Abrahams love story fills uselessly some screen time. It could have been avoided, without damaging the main plot in any way.Also, for non-English audience, the patriotic pride is a tad overbearing. It is a fine movie, but the big winner is the music, hardly ever used to best effect. You can forget the whole story and you will still remember the boys dressed in white running in slow motion on the beach.",7,2,2,31 May 2017
La La Land," A pleasant break from reality - just like during the Great Depression
","Usually, musicals are about a boy, a girl, a bunch of good songs and some dancing. I am not a big fan of the genre, but I definitely prefer any Astaire-Rogers movie than later productions with loud, long songs and too much dancing (anything with Gene Kelly).Therefore, I enjoyed La La Land. It has a very simple plot, some pleasant songs, among which the great 'City of stars' and most of the dance numbers are not overdone - apart from the first one, of course.The opening scene made me fear for the worst, being a bombastic number with amazing acrobatics and many people involved. But then boy and girl meet not so cute, with some minor road-rage, and the show tones down a bit. Gosling is Sebastian, a would-be jazz pianist and Stone is Mia, a would-be actress.After the bumpy start, they get together and support each other's dream, until their professional success becomes the main problem. Not a groundbreaking plot: from poor and happy, to rich and famous but not so happy anymore. The slightly melancholic ending wraps up the story perfectly.I usually do not like much Gosling, but he was OK as Sebastian and Stone is lovely. However, in too many close-ups of her face, her eyes and lips look disproportionately huge. Neither is a great singer, but their imperfection is quite endearing. They had enough chemistry and their songs and dances were fine.My only negative remark is about some corny dialogue. Both Sebastian and Mia encourage each other 'not to care about what people think, but to do to what they like'. As performers, they should care a lot about pleasing people. Lots of 'artists' are out there doing what they like, with zero or very little following - and very rightly so, because they don't respect the public. While integrity is appreciated, self-absorption not so much....I left the cinema feeling better than when entered, which lately happens quite rarely. Maybe it is the hard times or the stress of life, but this movie was definitely a pleasant break from reality.",8,2,7,29 January 2017
Sicario," Disjointed narrative but interesting cinematography
","Emily Blunt plays Kate, a honest agent who mingles with the wrong law enforcement crowd. The first scene establishes Kate as a brave cop, but it is a totally gratuitous plunge into a horror movie and unnecessary to the main plot.The main plot being Kate joining a motley crew of macho men, travelling to Mexico for a suspicious operation. Among the crew is strong, silent Del Toro as Alejandro. Being a foreigner, his presence as a 'consultant' sounds fishy from the start.After the extraction and torture of a Mexican cartel member and several lies later, we finally discover that Alejandro was indeed a disreputable character and that Kate is in the wrong line of business.Most memorable is the scene in the tunnel, with an unusual but captivating cinematography. Overall, the plot is fairly predictable, with the expected statement about the West being the father of all evils - just before being shot, the Mexican drug lord tells his killer that it was the Americans who taught him his methods...Whatever the story may be, looks like there are plenty of non-Westerns who are willing to learn and even surpass their alleged masters in cruelty and cunning. Perhaps it's time they should start taking their own responsibilities.",4,2,4,20 February 2019
Pretty Woman," Unsolved mystery
","I will never understand why this movie is described as a 'modern Cinderella' story. Does it mean that contemporary women need to be prostitutes to meet a 'prince'? Or that prostitution is the sort of career you would recommend to your daughter?Everybody knows the wildly unrealistic plot, which I found stupid years ago and still do, whenever I happen to stumble on this stupid movie on TV. In fact, it seems stupider every time.Roberts as Vivian is the unbearable 'street wise, gold-hearted hooker' who exists only in movies. And, as it happens in movies, 'respectable' people are obviously less deserving of respect than Vivian, because they're all liars and hypocrites and the only 'honest' person is the hooker.The 'romance' Vivian develops with her customer Edward, is based on a fat paycheck for a week of her services. Really the best way to start a relationship. I can imagine Edward and Vivian twenty years after reminiscing their tender meet-cute... 'You were such a pretty hooker with your miniskirt and boots walking the Hollywood Boulevard looking for a john..'",2,0,5,2 July 2019
The Disaster Artist," You cannot make up this stuff
","This is a vey enjoyable, well made movie about unbelievably real events in the Hollywood movie industry. James Franco did an amazing job playing Tommy Wiseau, a guy I could hardly believe existed for real.The baggy, ill-fitting, clothes, the weird accent, the long, black hair are reproduced to perfection, as are some of the scenes from the infamous 'The Room' that roll with the end credits.Even if I don't live in the USA and the 'The Room' never reached European screens, I could see bits and pieces online and I found them hilarious. I was therefore intrigued by this biography. But even if you are not familiar with the source material, this movie is thoroughly enjoyable.",7,0,0,15 August 2018
The Departed," Too much Nicholson is not a good thing
","'The Departed' starts strong, a taut thriller that leaves you on the edge of the sit for about half his length. Midways, things start to go wrong. Actually, they start to go nowhere. Once we have firmly established who are the good guys and who the baddies, and also the fact that  allegedly  there is only a thin line in between, the movie gets stuck in a rut called the Jack Nicholson over the top performance.It is regrettable to think that this could have been a truly great movie without Jack Nicholson. He is given possibly the longest screen time and during all of it, he just goes along doing his usual stuff, the mad grin, the lecherous wink, the foul language, etc Nicholson by the book. Nicholson and more Nicholson. We are not spared even a very choreographic final scene, so fake that even an amateur actor could have played it better.It is a relief that Nicholson did not get nominated for this part. The movie is quite compelling when he is not on screen. Di Caprio is surprisingly good, playing vulnerable in a credible way and also Damon, playing creepy even better than in 'Ripley'. One really sides with Di Caprio, the lonely, unappreciated, unloved hero, hoping for a happy ending. Unfortunately, we know that in this sort of movies copious bloodshed and tragedy rule. Luckily, Wahlberg in a key role is around to provide some sort of satisfactory closure. Wahlberg almost disappeared from the screen after several good performances, which is a pity because he is gifted. It would have made the movie a lot more interesting if he and Martin Sheen had more time on screen, rather than the lamentable Nicholson.On the whole, this is a good movie, but not a great one. For sure the script denotes some ignorance of police procedures. The whole investigative side requires massive doses of suspended disbelief. It seems rather bizarre that a police inspector is given the job of checking the background of all his fellow officers only because his boss likes his face, but without anybody checking his background or working with him. An undercover agent has license to kill and no duty to report criminal actions while actually taking part in them. An FBI informer, thanks to his status is free to continue his criminal career. Does it mean that if I talk to the Feds I can go around killing whomever I want? Finally, half hour could have easily been chopped off, perhaps by eliminating most Nicholson scenes, and the end is definitely muddled up, with Damon absurdly shown as being constantly free of suspicion. In other movies police officers get suspended for a lot less of what Damon gets away with in 'The Departed'.",6,1,2,28 January 2007
American Made," Top class entertainment
","The plot is loosely based on the real story of Barry Seal, a TWA pilot who worked for the CIA and also as a drug and weapons smuggler.Cruise is in top form as Barry, the reckless pilot who abandons the safe but boring job of airline pilot to embark on a little spying. The aerial photographing of Central America soon turns into more dangerous assignments, reaching the point of no return when Barry starts working for the Medellin cartel.Weapons smuggling is added into the mix, together with training Nicaraguan Contras. It's a major political mess, during which Barry manages to earn huge amounts of cash, for which he must find creative hiding places (think Breaking Bad, but funnier).The film is brilliantly edited, with an authentic feeling for the period (it takes place between the end of the 70s and 1986). The main narrative is interspersed with Barry recording events chronologically and his effort will make sense at the end.Even if the story is not about funny events, the ride is most agreeable.",8,1,1,15 December 2019
Crazy Heart," Soporific – worst Bridges movie ever?
","Much as I like Jeff Bridges, I think this is one of his worst movies ever. The plot revolves around the downfall of a faded country-western singer, who likes drinking and is not good at relationships. He is supposed to start appreciating life again, thanks to the love for a young reporter – a single mother, to add also the love for the child into the package. Unfortunately, the love story is complicated, but there is a happy ending of some sort  I suppose. I cannot really say I followed too closely, because I fell asleep half way into the movie. This is something that almost never happens to me, unless the movie is really boring, and in this case I can confirm this movie is so incredibly boring that it does not even feel like an original movie. More like a patch-up job of countless 'rebirth' stories. Weirdly enough, Jeff Bridges looks a lot like Kris Kristofferson, more than like his handsome self. Since I hate country-western I did not even appreciate the music. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the female star of the movie, the young mother who helps Jeff resurrecting. She is also supposed to be a great actress, but I cannot understand why. I am starting to get tired of her chipmunk cheeks and her perennial half smile – suggesting she is seductive but also approachable, or whatever. I would not describe her as having any star appeal. In fact, I am avoiding anything she is in. Conclusion: Jeff Bridges deserved an Oscar, but not for this kind of junk. Coming from a Jeff Bridges fan, this is some statement.",1,8,15,7 June 2010
Edge of Tomorrow," Fighting the aliens with a grin
","One would hardly think of Tom Cruise having a lighter side, but in Edge of Tomorrow his character is actually flawed and funny.The plot is sort of Groundhog Day plus alien invasion. Cruise plays Cage, a liaison officer forced to fight against the aliens. Trouble is, he is a coward and has no real military training.Without mentioning any spoiler, Cage gets in trouble from day one, but he also gets a chance to re-live the same day, improve his fighting skills and getting to know female war hero Rita (AKA 'full metal bit*h'). Rita and Cage together are the only chance to win the alien invasion. They are not a good match, but their imperfections work well together.Emily Blunt plays Rita convincingly as a tough fighter and she has a lot of chemistry with Cruise. Despite the violence of some scenes, the movie has some funny parts and it is very entertaining. Bill Paxton is also in it, regrettably one of his last movies.",8,0,0,9 March 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," The dream-life of the criminal and irresponsible
","Jordan Belfort (played by Di Caprio) wants to make money as quickly as possible and decides to pursue the fast track by selling hot air, otherwise known as stock trading. He also likes getting high on drugs and prostitutes (sort of comes with the territory). Therefore, we are 'force-fed' lots of orgies scenes, even if I got the point after the first one.There is also a sort of love story gone sour mixed into the decadent life-style, but it won't break anybody's hearts. In fact, hearts are the accessory nobody needs in this movie.I had read some reviews mentioning how OTT this was, but they were not even close to reality. Told in a manic and repetitive style, this is the lurid tale of a disgusting, greedy, criminal ass**le and his equally despicable, moronic friends. In other words, Scorsese did a re-take of Goodfellas, moving from the mafia environment to Wall Street. I suppose this is to prove that all men are equally corrupted and disgusting, regardless of the environment... which is a rather depressing view of society (regardless of the orgies).Half-way through, I started to feel nauseated by the overblown and endless sequence of shouted profanities, illegal deals and all sorts of wild parties, inclusive of one guy masturbating at the sight of Jordan soon-to-be second wife. Even if I know that the Academy's standards are very low, I was surprised to see that a movie with a guy jerking off was considered Oscar material.Final note: even my male companion got fed up one hour into this, to prove that not every man is actually like Scorsese is repeatedly showing us.",1,7,10,22 May 2016
The Reader," Cold hearted
","This is a very cold movie and dangerously close to a hollow and fake one, like the typical Oscar fare. My problem with it is that it is very difficult to sympathize with either one of the two main characters and the other players are just shadows moving in the background. Much was written about the early sex scenes, which are beautifully lit and bring to mind soft-porn movies rather than anything linked with the holocaust. Because of the way the story is presented - a torrid affair between a boy and an older woman - everything that happens afterward tastes fake. Sure, there are some pretty serious questions hanging around - German guilt, personal choices, etc... - but eventually it all boils down to a couple of unpleasant, cold-hearted people who do not care much about others and little about themselves. Hanna is a little bit more believable as a character, as the uneducated, brutal creature who just obeys orders and does not think about the past or consequences. The boy Michael is a stereotype of the cold German, and on top of that, his actions are totally illogical. First he is supposed to be in love with Hanna, but does nothing to help her (due to German guilt I guess, but still unforgivable, especially coming from somebody who chose law as his profession). Then, after many years he is again 'nice' to her, but refuses any direct contact and finally, when it is conveniently too late, he decides to come clean and confess. Of course people behave in illogical and inconsistent ways, but I found his behavior really too much of a mess. Kate Winslet as Hanna is good, but again, this role is possibly the most unsympathetic, distasteful and ambiguous she ever played. I'd rather see a good comedy any time than a pretentious, made-for-the-Oscar movie like this one.",4,6,12,16 March 2009
The Terminal," Contrived and over-sentimental
","I watched this on TV some years ago and did not like it. A few nights ago it was on again and I decided to give it another chance. Hanks plays Viktor, coming to America from a fictional Eastern European country and finding himself stranded at the airport.A revolution erupted in his country and his passport is confiscated. Instead of being deported or arrested and because of the maniacal behavior of the airport security supervisor, Viktor finds himself living in the terminal.Hanks plays Viktor with a heavy accent and mannerism, but does not manage to make his character sympathetic. An eccentric who does not want to divulge the reason for his journey, Viktor finds support from airport workers and gets mixed in their life. He also manages to carry on a very unlikely love story with beautiful flight attendant Amelia (Zeta-Jones), but the love story feels contrived at best.My idea of airport terminals is that they are the quintessential passing-through area. My idea of nightmare would be to be stuck in one, so for me it is impossible to understand why Viktor decides to stay rather than taking his chances by getting out. This is linked to the reason of this journey, but it is also very contrived.Claustrophobic, pointless and annoying, especially when we finally get the revelation of Viktor's purpose in New York – yet another over-sentimental cliché from Spielberg.",3,3,5,11 July 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," This is a fairy tale....
","In fairy tales characters are straightforward good or evil, so that the audience does not get confused. Shawshank is the sort of prison where convicts are 'good' and guards are 'evil', so that you know immediately who to root for.The main characters in the movie are Andy and Red, respectively played by Robbins and Freeman. Robbins is an actor with a natural creepiness that cannot be neutralized even by the most positive role. We are supposed to root for Andy, but the ambiguity about his guilt is kept going two thirds into the movie and does not help to establish him as a sympathetic character. Freeman is by now a stand-in for God. He conveys gravitas and righteousness, even to a murderer. He deserves a happy ending against all odds.The story unfolds extremely slowly, with the usual bonding and strife among inmates and abusive guards stirring the mix. The only plot twist is an absurd conversation between Andy and the prison's warden. In possession of vital information about his case, allegedly clever Andy chooses to share it with the evil warden, rather than with his lawyer. This is clearly an idiotic decision, but so far looks like nobody noticed.However, the simple tale of a man convicted for a double murder, taking place almost exclusively within the prison walls is hardly material for a masterpiece. Even more so when based on a Stephen King novel. King may be massively famous, but subtle he is not.I guess the reasons for the huge popularity of this movie lies exactly in its simple structure and exploitation of basic emotions and human qualities such as endurance, hope, faith and integrity.The main message of a film is an even more basic 'Everything is going to be alright'. That is, if you consider decades spent in prison as a metaphor for life.",2,0,4,26 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Well-deserved Oscar for pretentiousness
","Washed up Hollywood star Riggan wants to prove he is a 'real' actor by directing and starring in a Broadway play. But perhaps he cannot, because he is mental.Wrapped around the claustrophobic world of actors, the movie is an exercise in navel-gazing and smugness. I guess it must be a big deal for a Hollywood superstar to prove to his peers that he is not just a money-making machine but also a talented actor. However, I truly do not care about the hysterics and anguish of Hollywood actors. That is why, when Birdman was acclaimed by the critics I already suspected yet another inflated balloon full of nothing. I waited until I could watch the movie for free, because I was very reluctant to waste money on yet another 'Academy-worth' piece of crap and I am very happy I saved my hard-earned money.The joke is twice on the audience, because the other theme explored by Birdman, besides narcissist actors, is audience stupidity. Not being the sort of person who cares about superheroes movies, I was nevertheless annoyed by the fact that the public of said movies is vilified by this piece of elitist crap.It is difficult to point out what I disliked most about Birdman, since I hated everything: the overbearing drum soundtrack, characters shouting their lines, the smugness of the whole concept, the patronizing dialogs, etc I do not even think Keaton was so great in it.Finally, it is depressing to notice that the number of movies I want to walk out from is increasing exponentially. After decades of watching movies, what I expect is an interesting story told in an engaging way, but what I find is more and more egotistic directors busy only with producing crap bearing their trademark signature, being it Tim Burton Goth-chic or Wes Anderson smug-naive.",1,32,65,18 January 2015
The Big Short," Quirky and entertaining
","A moving about the financial crash of 2008 sounds both daunting and depressing. After all, most common folks understand nothing about high finance and were just victims of the credit crunch.Turns out that this was a most entertaining movie, explaining among many other things also how big banks make high finance impossible to understand ON PURPOSE. Personally, I am a 'common folk' but I always got the impression bankers and financial institutions were out to sc**w me. Turns out I was right, but like the Steve Carell character, saying so does not makes me one bit happy.The plot follow the three main players (and group of players), all involved in finance and among the very few who understood the house market was going to crash because of subprime and fraudulent practices. Despite the heavy subject, the movie is edited in a quirky, entertaining way and all the actors give excellent performances. I particularly liked Christian Bale (never one of my favorites) and Steve Carell. But Gosling was equally good playing unlikable guy from Deutsche as were the two younger guys Magaro and Wittrock. The three actors playing Carell team were equally good. Pitt plays a minor role in an understated way. Wonderful cast with no star performance stealing screen time.You will probably leave the cinema enlightened and embittered, but also a lot more the wiser.",8,3,6,3 January 2016
Prometheus," A rehash of Alien, minus the cat
","Throughout the years I came to consider Alien and Blade Runner more as exceptions than as standard Ridley Scott masterpiece productions. Therefore, I did not have high expectations for Prometheus.Nevertheless, it was with some anticipation that I joined a crowded audience for the premiere of Prometheus in Brussels. I watched online the promotional 'teasers' about 'David' and about the fictional 2023 speech for TED, delivered by Guy Pierce (as Peter Weyland) and I was hoping for some new concepts to be developed.Turns out, those two teasers were – almost – the best part of the movie. I cannot but agree with most other reviews so far. Great photography and CGI, poor story.The movie opens with an enigmatic sequence about DNA merging, which is left unexplained. What follows is a rehash of the Alien plot. Namely: assorted crew sent for an undisclosed mission; mysterious android who might have a hidden agenda; spunky heroine; a hasty exploration leading to infiltration of alien material; dire events that cause the extinction of almost all the crew does that remind you of Alien or I am biased? Only this time there are no pets on board and I really miss the cat Jones.The distinctive qualities of Prometheus are few. The crew is supposed to explore the planet from which humankind originated, thanks to alien 'Engineers'. I guess this should be the great twist – looking for the creator rather then stumbling upon the destructor. Unfortunately the development and outcome are very similar to Alien, with zero depth attached to the philosophical quest.Frankly laughable, even at fictional level, the way the so-called scientists explore the alien artifacts and analyze the samples they collected. Indeed, some of the scenes cause unintentional amusement When the spaceship lands, even if the 'scientists' are told there are only few hours of daylight left, they rush out like children to investigate the alien 'building'. Once inside, they touch everything around them, sticking their fingers everywhere. Two of them manage to get lost, even if they are carrying very sophisticated directional equipment...Worth mentioning a creepy scene of the Engineers escaping along dark corridors and the tri-dimensional space map (as mentioned, the visual part is terrific). Also the enigmatic android David. He is truly the star of the movie, and it is not a good sign when an android is the most interesting 'character' of a movie. The Rapace character – 'scientist' Elizabeth Shaw – is not so successful.If you saw Alien you might not be so impressed by Prometheus. Perhaps young audience will like it better, but what I start to find tiring in the Alien universe is that we still have no clue about how all this started or is going to end. And sometimes closure is really needed.",5,11,22,1 June 2012
Marriage Story," Showbusiness people are narcissistic
","Charlie and Nicole (Driver and Johansson) are a thirty-something, director-actor, couple with a young son. Charlie is a NY lover, Nicole is from LA and allegedly put her movie career on hold when she moved to NY to work for hubby Charlie's theatrical productions.The couple is going through a rough patch, when after ten years in NY, Nicole receives an offer to star in a TV pilot and moves back to LA, with her mum and sister, bringing son Henry with her. Nicole wants a divorce ASAP, while Charlie still thinks they are getting back together and does not catch the drift until he is served papers.Enter divorce lawyers, in the shape of obnoxious Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), working for Nicole, while Charlie hires - in succession - two lawyers with different degrees of aggressiveness (and hourly fees).What we have here is two highly narcissistic people, who want to pursue their careers and find that family gets in their way. Nicole wants to do more than acting, but Charlie never allowed her to direct. With divorce comes the freedom to do so, because what the world needs is yet another director - what a shame would have been for humankind if Nicole missed her chance.On the other hand, Charlie, described as self-involved, seems quite lethargic in most situations, especially when spending 'quality time' with brat - I mean, beloved son - Henry. That kid freaked me out, he looks a lot like the one in The Shining.Johansson gets lots of monologues, which seem to go on forever. Driver, an actor whose appeal always escaped me, gives another sleepwalking performance. Dern is OTT aggressive, the stereotype lawyer you love to hate. Julie Hagerty, as Nicole's mother plays borderline crazy and she's as annoying as most of the main cast. It does not help that both Nicole (with mummy) and Charlie break into cringe-worth long songs, stretching the running time over 2 hours. I started checking my watch about half way...Overlong and self-indulgent, this uneven mix of 'Annie Hall' and 'Kramer vs. Kramer', is still likely to find a large audience in the shape of anybody involved with a divorce (half of the US population?)",1,158,285,17 December 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," Pointless and depressing
","The main plot is about Walt Disney trying to make the Mary Poppins movie. Disney had to get rights from the novels' author, an unpleasant woman named Helen Goff who went by the pen name of PL Travers. Thompson plays Travers as an über-British, frosty, frigid spinster who hated everything about the movie and spread misery around her.The secondary plot explains why Travers was such a b—tch. She had a traumatic childhood and her alcoholic, banker father died when she was 7. Therefore, the big revelation is that Mary Poppins is not actually about Mary, but about Mr. Banks who stands for Travers's father and get a happy ending instead of dying young. What it is not explained is why a childhood movie is about bankers and why it is titled Mary Poppins, since Mary is actually a secondary character.Moreover, the revelation about Travers's past does not excuse her. Travers' miserable childhood does not make her more sympathetic. More misery is added by a scene during which Disney trades stories of his own miserable childhood, trying to get Travers on board - or maybe to prove that even an unhappy child can grow into a happy adult...Disney did not invite her to the premiere of Mary Poppins and I can fully understand his uneasiness about having this controlling and ungrateful woman around, to spread more misery.The whole story was not worth a movie, especially not a very long one as this. The Disney- Travers relationship is unpleasant from start to finish (he is manipulative, she is stubborn and unyielding). The father-daughter history is very depressing.",1,1,3,21 July 2017
Flight," The higher you fly, the more disastrous the crash
","A good, solid story about the fall from glory of an arrogant pilot. It can be seen as a metaphor of addiction. Substance abuse makes you fly high, but you lose track of your limits and people around you start to dislike your self-centered attitude. Some of those people are lost forever; others may still be around to forgive you.The plot itself is about cocky airline pilot Whip, who manages to save most of his passengers during a disastrous flight from Orlando to Atlanta. Despite (or because) being high on cocaine, Whip successfully performs a daredevil move and lands the plane on a field. There are six casualties though and legal actions to follow.Whip is in full denial of his addiction to cocaine and alcohol and manages to alienate everybody around him. Linked to the main story is a rather unnecessary subplot involving a female addict. Satisfactory ending.",7,3,4,9 March 2015
Unbroken," One third raft, two thirds POW, three thirds waste of time
","It is a shame that the exceptional story of Louis Zamperini ended up on screen as such a mediocre film. The plot is roughly divided in two parts: the film starts during WWII, when Louis is a bombardier based in the Pacific. A few flashbacks show Louis as a difficult child, who started training as a runner to keep out of trouble and ended up competing at the Berlin Olympic games.Within some minutes from the beginning, Louis plane crashes and one third of the movie is spent with him and surviving crew members adrift in the ocean for 47 days. Watching young people die of starvation is not particularly amusing. However, it can be assumed that this part drags on for what seems an eternity to give an idea of how those 47 days felt.The remaining two thirds of the movie are about Louis being fished out by the Japanese and spending the rest of the war as POW, being constantly abused by Watanabe, the sadistic camp's commander. This part seems to drag on even longer and it is developed without any subtlety. Scene after scene Louis is beaten up by Watanabe but manages to retain some dignity. Unfortunately, witnessing the horrific conditions of POW is even less fun than castaways dying of starvation and the whole movie feels like an overlong torture, despite the final five minutes left for the - sort of - upbeat ending",1,7,13,9 May 2015
Looper," Several levels of implausibility and not a single likable character
","Loopers are professional killers who in the year 2044 eliminate assorted people – presumably other criminals - sent from the future. Because the future is a place where they invented time travel, but made it illegal. Also, the future is a place where it is almost impossible to dispose of a body – although when we see it done, it does not seem such a big deal Anyway, given this bizarre premises we are also explained that loopers are so called because after an indeterminate number of years in the profession, they must close the loop by killing their older self, shipped back from 30 years in the future.At this stage, whatever effort one made to suspend disbelief comes crashing down. Since they already know that in 30 years they will be executed (by themselves), why these loopers do not try to eliminate the mob king who is systematically ordering their executions? Why do they accept passively to be shipped back to the past with a sack over their head? If this is a serious logical flaw (and there are many others, pointed out by several reviewers), worse is to come, in the shape of a TK obnoxious child, who derails completely the script into an additional dimension of implausibility.So far we were dealing with ruthless criminals who have no problem shooting, torturing and burning bodies, but suddenly women and children are off-limits. This 'honour among thieves' is a well-beloved cliché in mainstream movies, but it is an absurd illusion. In real life, cold-blooded killers kill anybody - women and children included - because they are unsympathetic to all human beings, not just to other adult males. Selective lack of empathy is absurd – and so is this movie. Finally, we have the delusional notion that 'love can cure anything'. Unfortunately, there are no reported cases of paranoid-schizophrenic cured by mummy's love....One cannot expect much logic in a movie about time travel, but even low expectations are too high for this mess. The only partial saving grace is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays convincingly a despicable character.",3,5,12,5 November 2012
Cloud Atlas," Overdose of politically correct
","Contrary to what some pretentious director may believe, one may understand a movie and still not like it. That is the case with Cloud Atlas, which mixes 6 average stories to prove that: the soul survives; soulmates do exist and white people are evil.The 6 scrambled but linked plots are book-ended by the story taking place in a low-tech post-apocalyptic future. Cowardly Zachry, played by Tom Hanks, lives with a tribe that worships a deity called Sonmi-451 and is constantly menaced by savage Kona barbarians. Despite his fear, Hanks helps a member of a more advanced group, played by Halle Berry, to launch a signal for the evacuation of what is left of mankind to another planet.This story contains the only unsolved mystery: how did Zachry's village even come to exist, considering the brutal, random Kona assaults. Also, as an added annoying bonus, Zachry has 'visions' of the devil (played by poor Hugo Weaving, who is the villain in all the stories).In a movie this long and complicated, 'visions' are the last thing one needs.The other story in chronological order are: in 1849 a lawyer sailing back home saves a stow away Afro-American, who strangely happens to live in a South Pacific island inhabited by Maoris. All the villains on board are white, so once back at home the lawyer decided to join the abolitionists. Also, the lawyer is married to a read-headed, freckled oriental woman (this is linked to the soulmate concept).In 1936 the love story of a gay couple is destroyed by suicide. The link with the previous story is the diary written by the lawyer and read by one of the lovers.In 1973, Berry plays a journalist who meets the remaining half of the gay couple and gets involved in a story that looks like blacksploitation with nothing to do with the rest of the movie, apart from proving that white people are bad.In 2012, an elderly publisher gets locked up in a retirement home, but manages to escape. The evil nurse of the home is played by Weaver, who looks nothing like a woman - albeit a very masculine one. The link to the previous story is a house. This story tries to offer some comic relief, but it is not very funny.In a dystopian future, in South Korea, a female clone named Sonmi-451 goes through the same plot line of The Matrix, albeit in a more condensed time-frame. Chosen by a revolutionary group for reasons impossible to understand, Sonmi-451 discovers that the world is not what it seems and that humans deserve to know the truth, only to get the group attacked by the authorities and herself in danger. She also falls for her saviour, played by Jim Sturgess (who's the lawyer married to the oriental redhead).All characters in each segment are played by the same bunch of actors, which means Berry gets to play a Caucasian blonde, Jim Sturgess is badly disguised as 'oriental' and Korean Doona Bae plays both Sonmi-451 and a weird- looking redhead.In fact, the make-up is excessive to the point of distraction More than the idea of souls surviving and meeting again, one gets politically correct characters shoved down the throat - with the constant of Hugo Weaving, white male and incarnation of evil.",1,6,15,19 February 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Tries so hard to be a 'cool' post-Bond movie
","I guess Kingsman should be a parody of James Bond, mixed with graphic violence, mixed with the launch of a new 'franchise'. The keyword being 'franchise' - the crown jewel of contemporary movie-making.Given the premises and the endless thirst of the audience for more gore, more 'comic' violence (Tarantino style) and more stupidity, Kingsman does not fail to deliver.Colin Firth plays the coolest spy ever, in a service so secret that nobody knows about it. Modelled on King Arthur's mythology, members of the service have knights nicknames, such as Lancelot and Galahad and are supposed to be 'real gentlemen'. Any attempt to provide the movie with style ends with the display of the expensive clothes and accessories the 'knights' wear (AKA product placement)Samuel L. Jackson plays a parody of all the villains he played in countless movies. However, most of the weight of the movie is carried by a couple of unremarkable newcomers: one male, one female, to guarantee gender balance.Further political correctness is provided by a large number of additional villains being white males and by aristocrats demeaning themselves, commoners-style.The plot is classic James Bond: eccentric, powerful guy wants to take control of the planet via demented plan. Follows a series of fights and last second interventions and without any suspense the end is known. Silly, vulgar, bombastic, violent, vile, crude 'entertainment' that will definitely produce many more sequels.",1,3,5,12 February 2017
The Hangover Part III," Deranged Alan steals the movie with disastrous results
","The third and last installment of the Hangover franchise gives far too much screen time to the increasingly obnoxious Alan character. Erroneously described as a 'man-child', Alan seems to be a borderline narcissist psychopath.In the opening scene Alan causes the death of a giraffe and a series of motorway car crashes without batting an eyelash. He then proceeds to cause his dad a heart attack. At his dad funeral, Alan states that he'd rather see his mum die, with mum listening horrified. All this is not funny, lack of empathy being a trademark of psychosEnter the 'Wolf Pack' and their attempt to get Alan committed. The attempt is thwarted by the return of Mr. Chow and his criminal activities causing another foolish series of events. These events include additional cruelty against animal, abuse of elderly and a very gross 'courting' scene involving Alan and an overweight, rude shop clerk.While I enjoyed The Hangover I and II, despite the second being a carbon copy of the first, I found this one completely humorless. The only slightly funny moment is the theft of gold, with a little bit of a twist. Unfortunately, even that half decent scene derails into more violence and stupid behavior. You might enjoy only if you find true psychos (such as Alan and Mr. Chow) funny.",1,3,6,9 November 2014
Pineapple Express," The monkey's out of the bottle
","Rogen and Franco are Dale and Saul, a couple of weed-smoking slackers who get involved in a murder. This type of movie is usually targeted to a young audience and tends to be filled with gross profane jokes, bad language and stupidity. Here we have plenty of bad language and stupidity, but the jokes are actually quite funny. Having mostly seen Franco in 'serious' movies, I was surprised by his comic skills. He is hilarious as the perpetually stoned Saul, blurting out one idiotic sentence after the other. He is also very cute and a bit of eye candy never hurts. Rogen seems always to play the same part of obnoxious, lazy looser, but here he was funnier and slightly more energetic than usual.The fight scenes were actually hilarious and sort of believable, with people hitting each other like in real life, without any spectacular stunt. They 'just' punched randomly, often hitting the wrong target and screaming in pain. Danny McBride in the supporting role of Red is also funny and so is Begley Jr. in the small role of the crazy father of Dale's girlfriend.",7,1,2,10 October 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Ripping off others - equally dumb - action movies
","Just when I thought that John Wick was a decent movie for its genre, here comes the curse of the franchise. Chapter 2, or how to ruin a self-standing movie with an irrelevant sequel that requires a third chapter to tie loose ends (sort of what happened with The Matrix).In this chapter, John is once more forced out of 'retirement' to fulfill his debt of honor with Italian mobster D'Antonio. But Italians being notoriously double-crossing cowards, Wick ends up in deep s**t.However, Wick is now the superhuman anti-hero. Despite being beaten, stabbed, run over, etc... he still stands with very little need for repair. Not only that, but he manages to kill enemies by the hundreds, while none of his adversaries seems able to aim or to just get a gun instead of engaging in body contact. Whatever little 'realism' was in chapter 1, it's completely gone here.We also discover that the 'underworld' is run as if we were in the 50s, apart from excessive tattooing, and that there is honor among some thieves - and if you believe that, you'll believe anything. But the capital sin of chapter 2 is that despite ultra violence, silly premises, car chasing and fights, it is boring as a video game, rather than cool as a superhero cartoon. After each fight, Wick gets a few moments to recharge an then starts again. I would give it one point for the photography and one because I like Keanu Reeves, but I shall deduct one point, because all the assassins wearing black is really TOO cliché....PS the opening scene is a total rip off of Bond movies: action sequence almost unrelated to the rest of the plot; the taylor scene is a rip off of Kingsmen; Wick himself is a rip off of Neo, minus leather coat and sunglasses, but still mainly dressed in black.",1,7,14,6 August 2017
Joy," A soporific mess with a shamelessly obvious agenda
","Despite the fact that I like Lawrence, when Joy was released, I decided to skip it, because the story of the woman who invented the Magic Mop did not seem gripping enough to carry a movie. Fast forward to TV broadcast and I found out that I was right.The plot is your average 'be yourself to overcome all problems', compounded by an overdose of pseudo-feminism.... and if being oneself was enough to be successful, we'd all be rich and famous.Joy's grandmother narrates the events, adding nothing to the plot, except weirdness. Joy was a creative child, but her parents' divorce damaged her and she took years to recover, gathering a failed marriage and two children on the way. Joy is presently encumbered (and blessed?) by her family of weirdoes, inclusive of ex-hubbyTony, living in her basement and serial monogamist daddy Rudy, embarking in yet another relationship with wealthy Italian Trudy.Her sparkle of genius comes about when she is forced to mop a broken glass from the floor, cutting her hands to squeeze the mop. A normal person would swipe the glass away before mopping, but in Joy's case, this prompted the creation of the Magic Mop.What follow is a messy start of a business enterprise, in which every member of her dysfunctional family gets involved, giving advice ranging from reasonable to extremely bad.Probably, not many would be interested in the story of how the pencil sharpener came to be, especially if the inventor was a man. In this case, since we're dealing with a female entrepreneur at the time of the #metoo, we're all supposed to root for Joy.Unfortunately, the script is extremely loose, some characters are totally useless (Joy's mother), other plain cliche (the evil step-sister). The strength of female bonding is overplayed (Joy and her BFF and her daughter and her grandmother) while heterosexual romance goes straight to the bin (failed relationship all over the place) to underline Joy's independence.I always found it difficult to enjoy a movie with an shameless agenda and this is no exception.",1,0,2,9 November 2019
Her," The fulfilment of fantasies about problem-free relationships
","'Her' boils down to sad sack, emotionally challenged Theodore, sort of 'falling' for his OS Samantha and masturbating to her voice, then they break up - actually, Samantha dumps him, just like a real girl would.Hardly a romantic concept and more the story of a guy unable to handle real life and disappointments, and finding solace in his imaginary world.Actually, Theodore's 'love' seemed to be hardly more than disguised lust, as proved by an early scene with him getting in touch with sleepless females to masturbate with their 'encouragement'. Maybe because I always found phone sex slightly ridiculous, I saw in Theodore's cyber sex nothing more than an evolution of the old 'sex with a stranger' concept. What Theodore seemed to be looking for was attention, adoration and sexual solace from a female creature, existing only to take care of his needs and asking for nothing in return. It is hard to think about a more selfish form of 'love'.....Besides, the concept of falling in love with unreachable people (being them rock stars or imaginary creatures) is nothing new. What is new is the technological support we have at our disposal, which encourages us to do so, thus avoiding all the inconveniences of a real relationships.A couple of plus points of an otherwise boring movie were the atmospheric soundtrack and the interesting photography and costumes - drab enough to look like real clothes, rather than futuristic uniforms.",3,6,11,6 May 2014
The Nice Guys," Starts as buddy movie, derails into a patchwork of clichÃ©s
","Crowe and Gosling play PIs with different personalities forced to work together. Not groundbreaking territory, but suitable for lighthearted entertainment. Unfortunately, what starts as a drama set in Los Angels in the late 70s, soon turns into a weird mix of Boogie Nights and Taxi Driver, minus the darkness of those two movies - but missing also their greatness.Gosling's young daughter gets mixed in the plot and proves to be way smarter than her father (not difficult) and very annoying. A sort of re-take of the Foster character in Taxi Driver, minus the prostitution. The group starts investigating the porn industry territory, but the plot meanders into other territories such as politics and pollution, without making much sense in any.Not a total disaster, but it tries too hard to be 'cool' and it is not very funny, which is sort of the kiss of death for a comedy. Really hope it won't have a sequel, but if that should happen for sure I'll give it a miss.",4,6,11,23 October 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Carbon copy of Raiders
","As mentioned by other reviewers, this movie is just a money-making machine, milking Indy's fans. It follow step by step the paper-thin plot of the first adventure, with the nasty Nazis as main enemies and a mythical, religious relic as the object of a frantic search.However, this installment is further ruined by the presence of Sean Connery as Indy's dad. Connery is a fine actor and I guess the idea was to have a dynamic duo of attractive actors. Unfortunately, dad and son spend most of their time bickering and sounding silly.The final indignity is the disappearance of the only strong female character - the spunky Marion - replaced by a blonde bimbo who cannot act and seems to be in the cast only to provide minimal sexual friction.The search is the usual jumping from place to place, around the world, while punching and getting punched by the Nazis in overlong scenes - inclusive of the compulsory chase and the overbearing musical score.",3,0,3,23 April 2017
The Great Gatsby," It is as bad as some says
","I did not read the novel, nor saw the 1974 movie (or rather, I forgot about it, because I found it very boring). Also, I liked a lot both 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo+Juliet', so I was definitely not awed by the novel or prejudiced against the director.Unfortunately, my open-minded approach did not help. This movie is a mighty mess, for two basic reasons that have nothing do with the source material or Luhrmann notorious bombastic style. These reasons are: awful acting and lack of chemistry, and they make the whole story collapse.Maguire is awful. I never noticed what a bad actor he is until I saw him playing Carraway. All he does is stare with his beady eyes and make grimaces. Being in almost every scene, he positively destroyed the movie.Di Caprio e Mulligan have zero chemistry. Impossible to believe in any passionate feeling between these two.Besides, spoiled, coward and selfish Daisy Buchanan is one of the most repulsive fictional characters. It was weird to see two men fighting for the affection of such an obnoxious woman, whose only saving grace is a pretty face. Not unusual, but I just could not buy into the 'tragedy' of mystery man Gatsby pining for shallow Daisy.I wanted to tell him to get a grip and find a better woman.Then comes the horrid music, the overblown party scenes and materialism trumping 'feelings' in every scene (what was that throwing shirts at Daisy? Was Gatsby employed by a luxury garment store?).If I have to save something, I'd go for the Lana Del Rey song and the final minute of the movie, both because I liked the typing on screen and because it brought this mess to a much awaited closure. 'So we beat on, boats against the current...' (I did my research ....)",1,5,7,24 April 2016
The Proposal," Cute comedy, maybe predictable but so what?
","Bullock does comedy very well, not just because she is a good actress but also because she is believable as a decent human being - contrary to Jennifer Lopez, just to mention the first name which came to mind -. This is the only problem with this movie. It is hard to buy Bullocks as a bitch, exactly because she is inherently good. However, the movie works out fine. Her leading man, Ryan Reynolds, is also quite good in a part that could easily fall into slippery territory. Unfortunately, he is a bit too young for Bullock and no real chemistry is detectable, but the pair still looks good together. The plot is easily said: Canadian boss needs to marry American citizen in order not to be deported. Being an unpleasant person, our girl Bullock does not have any man handy, so she has to ask her secretary. Forced to meet his family she falls for them. Very much along the 'When you were sleeping' lines (another movie where Bullock falls the family), but then again, what is wrong with that? We all need to belong, and the Bullock character was cut off from family relations for too long. She needed to build a hard exterior to protect herself and naturally enough, once back in touch with a softer environment she melts. It may be boring and predictable, but also very human and the stuff life is (or should) made of. Regardless of what the cynic might think.",9,2,5,25 July 2009
