The Rock," better than average action movie these days
","Better than average action movie these days, however it has way too much action.. The movie would be better off cutting some scenes off... and maybe a little more weighted out... elite commando can't win over the terrorists but than a chemical expert with 3 weeks-long drill and a pensioner who spent last 30 years in prison gets it all done... I wonder if I would be able to jump into a car and drove better than any police if I spent 30 years in prison (an example of a scene, that could have been left out...)...
Nevertheless it still is not a bad movie...",8,0,0,17 February 2020
Requiem for a Dream," gets better and better
","At first I though of how this is going to be one of a stupid movie again... But from about a middle, the movie got my full attention. I already got used to the unusual film shot, brisk changes, dramatic music.. Towards the end the movie got me.. Emotions and the situations of all main characters were expressed really well!",9,1,1,22 March 2020
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," drama from high school...
",First I thought it will be another high school-outsider movie.. But I was well surprised.. it wasn't only shallow teenage hit for one seasson.. Actually there was a number of phylosophical thoughts.. The movie had a good escalation.. I can recommend it..,8,0,0,1 April 2020
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," great movie
","Even after the years, the movie is still great.. it has a couple of illogical scenes, many other overacting the situation... yes, the movie have some holes now and than.. nevertheless watching it is fun.. maybe just because of the memories from childhood...",9,0,1,10 February 2020
Citizen Kane," an overrated movie to me
","I think I watched a different movie... Or maybe I am just complete film-illiterate, but the long discussion about uninterested topics almost made me fell asleep.. It can be the most influential movie, but I won't watch it again..",2,1,4,17 January 2020
The Impossible," strong story
",It is a very strong story. Especially because it was based on true story. It is really incredible what the family had to go through. The film setting in the tropical paradise is beautiful and many scenes are thrilling.,8,0,0,17 January 2020
The Great Dictator," what a surprise
","I did not really know what to expect.. I have known the final speech for a while and so I decided to see the entire movie. At first I thought it will be this dumb silent movie grotesque what I normally don't enjoy... But surprisingly, the Great Dictator is a very hilarious political satire with interesting plot and funny resemblances... especially when one considers the year when the movie was made, it definitely shall not be forgotten. I was about to give full 10 stars but because still I am not a fan of these kind of movies and especially at the beginning it took me a while to get caught my attention",9,0,0,9 March 2020
The Jungle Book," classics
","After watching the new Jungle book, I also wanted to remind myself the first movie. It is much less action (well the new one is kind of horror..). Definitely its is muh more suitable for children. More humorous and less serious, but the main story remains. And the great animation is admirable considering the age of the movie..",8,0,0,15 March 2020
Snatch," should have better rewatched Lock, Stock...
","I love Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.. Snatch is another gangster movie from London's underground.. Compared to the previous, or similar style-movies like pulp fiction etc. Snatch is however extremely slow.. full of boring dialogues, almost no action.. From time to time a short maniac shooting (or some action) scene and than back again to the boringness...",5,0,2,30 March 2020
Southpaw," another Rocky movie..
","I can't really say the movie was all bad.. but neither all good.. Basically it is another boxing movie.. A Boxer at the top of his career looses everything like a bolt from the blue so he can win most of it back after few weeks of training.. I found the plot really boring, the main characters were not described sufficiently.. Billy overshadows them all.. and Jake Gyllenhaal plays his role really well and you get to see a lot about how he's ripped if that catches your attention... I would however recommend the movie Cinderella man better..",5,0,1,31 March 2020
Rush," Lauda vs. Hunt
","A thrilling movie about the 1976 F1 Championship and the battle between the best drivers that time. It's nothing like fast and furious and such... This is actually a true story - one may speculate to which extent, but that is not the point of the movie. Amazing shots from the racing circuits and the special kind of rivalry/friendship between the two racers.. Together it makes a great movie!",10,1,2,25 March 2020
The Bourne Identity," good action worn out plot..
","The actions in the movie are decent.. usually not as absurd as the case of similar action movies.. but this kind of 'supe-ragent and evil CIA controlling the world' - type of movie is getting too boring... helps to understand why more and more people fall for conspiracy theories , though :D..",6,0,0,7 April 2020
54," not bad, but not really good either
",I quiet enjoyed the movie... showing the story of a famous club.. I can not rate the actual accuracy. However I was somehow missing a message of the movie..,7,0,0,23 February 2020
The Pianist," strong and sad story
","As all the war movies, The pianist is a very sad story of a jewish family, especially it's only survivor. The movie presents the struggle and everyday fight which catches the watcher's attention and doesn't let him go for the entire 2 and half hours.",9,0,2,19 January 2020
The Lion King," Lion King in new animation
","I saw, heard and read the story of lion king several times.. It was nice to see it once again. The animation was done very well but other than that this adaptation does not ass anything new (which is probably a good thing...)",9,0,1,16 February 2020
The Bourne Legacy," the same for the third time..
","I kind of felt like I saw the same movie 3 times all over.. the same plot, same type of action scenes... at least at the end there is an explanation (which was pretty obvious and absurd since the beginning..).. If you want to watch the movie for car chase, shoot-outs and similar action, than it a good one for you...",5,0,0,9 April 2020
Moulin Rouge!," big drama
","I am not the biggest fan of musicals, but when if itmust be catchy, original.. Moulin Rouge is very famous, the story-line is simple, scenes are nice to watch.. but somehow the movie was very predictable. Many modern songs did not fit well into the movie and overall it was rather borig",3,0,1,17 January 2020
Into the Wild," Beautiful movie
","Coincidently i just read the book Walden from Thoreau earlier this week.. i really disliked it.. there movie mentions, or paraphrase the book several time.. and it's much better experience! Although i will probably never understand the motive (getting closer to nature yes, but this extreme??) it did not disturb me at all. The supeetramp travels a big part of the western coast and its amazing to observe the nature there as well as wild Alaska.. unlike in the book, i actually enjoyed the philosophizing in the movie.. sister's narrative and music really fit into the whole picture. Normally i hate movies that are longer than 2 hours, but here i somehow wished for even more at the end!",10,0,1,13 February 2020
Invictus," What connects Rugby and Nelson Mandela?
","I normally don't like movies such as Invictus. I am also not a fan of mixing politics and sport... but this movie engulfed me... My rating is biased by my own experience though.Watching the movie threw me a couple of months back, specifically into the 2.nd of November 2019, the day after I arrived to South Africa.. I sensed 'something' in the air.. something was clearly going on among all those people with some kind of 'antelope' on their green shirts.. and suddenly around midday, the entire country got flooded with joy and happiness. I immediately realized what just happened. South Africa won the world cup again! Springbok's black captain Siya Kolisi became the most popular and beloved person during my entire stay..The movie gave me however much wider context and perspective on my own recent experience. I learned the about the history, the importance and it motivated me to google even more details about the characters, events, teams and about rugby in general. I fully enjoyed every second of the movie (including the final subtitles :D)..",10,0,1,16 February 2020
Pulp Fiction," A masterpiece
","Pulp Fiction is a legendary movie. Ever since I saw it for the first time, I fell in love with it.. The music completes the perfection!",10,1,2,20 February 2020
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," great movie
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a unique movie.. a style of a Trainspotting or Pulp Fiction.. So if you are fun of these types of movies, you can't be disappointed!",10,0,0,21 February 2020
Thor," Two worlds...
","There are 2 line in 2 different world.. Back on earth its somehow interesting, but in the world of Asgard there is a crazy fantasy sci-fi going on.. First I should say, that I do not particularly like sci-fi, not fantasy.. Marvel is also not my cup up tea.. But when these worlds get connected through love.. that was too much... The casting was however very good...",5,0,0,1 March 2020
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," good but overrated
","The movie is not bad.. I actually raised my rating by one star from last time I saw it.. but somehow I don't really get it... Milos Forman said it is an allegory of a life in communism.. Nevertheless, the fact is still that the McMurphy is a criminal who is just playing it to avoid punishment.. in fact he is kinda manipulating all the others that are less sane than him.. taking advantage of his position in the society being above others..I also do not feel that the nurse Ratched is as bad as the tries to show her. She makes what she thinks is best for the patients.. And they know they can get out.. when she is in control, everything is calm.. no joy, but not a mess as when McMurphy steps in.. that is the other extreme.. Actually my favorite character was Billy.. Poor kid downtrodden by his own mother...Definitely, the patients are not getting a good care. I hope mental health hospitals are being better these days! And if this is an allegory of life.. it may not be only communism.. every person may find tyrannical authorities in his teacher, parents, boss... but I don't think neither approach -> nor total chaos, nor total order is the key.. The movie can make you thinking about many things..",7,0,1,20 March 2020
The Lion King," beautiful movie
","After seeing the new lion king movie, I also wanted to remind myself the older one.. Both are great, but the older is simple unbeatable...",10,0,0,17 March 2020
Parasite," Great movie
","Parasite is an awesome movie. I would totally give full 10 star, but towards the end it starts to be a bit overescalated and in genreal, I didn't like the end of the movie...I was not sure who actually the parasite was, the family, or just the guy in the cellar? Who was actually supposed to be the hero, bad and good guy in the movie? somehow I feel the movie tries to make me like the family and forget that they are actually the bad-ass...",9,1,5,27 February 2020
The Woman in Black," lot of thrills
","Who likes to get scared, freaked out, shocked find a lot of these here.. The movie is full of mystery, superstition, ghosts , curses and such.. Who likes these will probably enjoy the movie.. it's like visiting a haunting house at a fair.. lot of unexpected things suddenly jumping on you.. strangely, I dont usually like these types of movie, but this one was not that bad.. and I also enjoyed the British style, architecture, country-side as well...",7,0,1,25 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Great movie
",Silent of the lamb is one of my favorite movie of it's genre.,9,1,2,17 January 2020
Toy Story 3," Toy story..
",I always liked the Toy Story... was nice to see the 3.rd part after a long time...,8,0,0,2 March 2020
Braveheart," Beautiful drama
",I understand why was this movie so popular. It is a splendid story of Scottish hero William Wallace so greatly played by Mel Gibson. Maybe almost 3 hours were too much.. Although it did not get boring a often happens to so long movies.. so only watch this movie when you have time for it...,9,1,3,5 March 2020
The Bourne Supremacy," action, but chaotic
",The movie has a lot of actions.. but they are way more chaotic and make even less sense than those in the first part.. If you aim to just enjoy the thrill (or you are planning a Euro-trip :D).. you may like the movie..,5,0,0,8 April 2020
Cinderella Man," from the salvation army line to the Madison Square Garden..
","The movie started boring, but soon really picked up. By the end I was boxing inside, trying to help Braddock... An amazing story of a Cinderella man, a phoenix, a man who made it from the line for soup to sell out the Madison Square Garden. A fight on the background of the great depression..",9,1,1,3 March 2020
