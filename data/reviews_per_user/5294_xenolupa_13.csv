Angels & Demons," The end of the movie spoils the whole (bad) movie
","The movie is bad: bad science, bad plot, bad timing, bad texts. Tom Hanks is one of the few reasonably good things (he looks good, his acting is not bad).Scientifically, the movie is stupid. Antimatter for a bomb? Noooo...The plot is stupid. Why would the bad guy think of such an elaborate scheme just to hit the Catholic Church? If this guy, who even became the 'number two' of the Catholic Church, has access to everything in the Vatican, it would be so easy to bring the church to its knees. No, for a good movie it has to be done as difficult as possible.Timing: cannot be. Racing around Rome like that is impossible. Taking action like that is impossible. Being right all the time about vague clues is almost impossible. Come on, preparing actions like this is also impossible.But the end of the movie... when it is revealed that the camerlengo is the bad guy, this really is stupid. He has done everything to help the good guys. And now he is the bad guy? Ridiculous. His centerpiece of evilness was the antimatter bomb. But he brings it high into the sky himself. And goes down to the ground with a parachute and survives. Why would he himself stop the destruction of the Vatican, what was his prime goal. Unbelievable. Stupid.I gave the movie a 3 instead of a 1 because of the wonderful views of Rome. The camera-work is excellent.",3,2,12,22 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," I really don't understand why people like this movie
","The acting is overacting. The plot does not exist. The story is completely unbelievable. This is fiction with over-fictional elements brought in a semi-serious setting. A farmer hiding Jews in the basement, being 'interrogated' friendly by a Nazi, while the guards wait outside, they come in later and shoot them all and let one escape. That is a bad start. It is stupid. The stupidity does not end. This was not a funny movie, this was not satire, this was not entertainment, this was a long long list of stupid scenes, one unbelievable plot hole after another. An insult to history, an insult to every intelligent movie-lover. I was mad after seeing this. I really do not understand why people give compliments to this movie. Really.",2,114,208,30 October 2009
Captain Marvel," Good, story, good acting, butch hero Captain Marvel
","My partner and I enjoyed ourselves with this movie. Long ago, I've read the origin stories of the 'original' Captain Marvel and his successor Ms. Marvel, and this movie has little to do with either of them (maybe with some later reboot of her origin story, but I haven't read those stories yet). The story in the movie is a very nice self-contained original reboot, set up with nice internal logic, and as many of the movie industry's superheroes undergo a reboot semi-regularly, this one is especially beautifully crafted.Of course Stan Lee is in there. Nicely done. The movie even starts with him: the 'Marvel' comic book sequence at the start contains a lot of different Stan Lee's and a lot of his quotes over the years.This movie also stars younger versions of Agent Coulson and director Fury and they look stunning.Brie Larson plays a butch woman, beautiful, self-assured, well-trained, with lots of character development, and different roles portraying different parts of her life: Carol Denvers, Vers, Captain Marvel. I also liked that she did not want to depend on other people. That she did not fall in love with some awesome man. That she took care of herself and others. A real hero.I like the story development. The Kree are good, the Skrull evil, and and before that and later it seems vice-versa. Carol was human, than Kree, than human again, and now I think she might be a hybrid. There's a lot of shooting and of course the heroes aim better than the bad people. The cat, Goose, is one to pay attention to. Also, don't leave the cinema until the scene after all the credits ended, because, again, cat.Some days ago I read that this movie amassed 455 million dollars during its opening weekend in the USA (plus what the movie made worldwide). Cool. I guess that means there will be at least one sequel. I look forward to see this integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, like in the movie Avengers: Endgame which will be released next month.",9,0,3,14 March 2019
Troy," Let's rip apart the Iliad and try to imitate Lord of the Rings
","I have read the Iliad. Several times. I have been at two different plays where the Iliad was performed. It is a magnificent story. This story has inspired and awed millions of people in thousands of years.The filmmakers of the film Troy decided that they didn't care about the respect Homer deserves with his magnificent story. The filmmakers didn't care at all.They ripped apart the story. They made a pile of papers on each paper one of the many characters in the story. And a pile of papers with events. And a pile with dates on which those events took place. And of course a pile with places where the events took place. OK, shuffle each pile, independently. Now, take the top paper of each pile and combine those. At the end, some piles will still contain some papers (I guess a lot of characters will be left over), but of course those can be thrown away. Put these combinations in chronological order. Then, shuffle a bit to create the idea of flashbacks. Write a film script around this mess. Make sure it does not resemble the age-old story Iliad.Now you have something that probably resembles the story in the film Troy.Create stunning sets and perform even more stunning camera work, really spectacular stunts and special effects and sounds. Add a lot of handsome actors, whose characters really have to be different from how Homer described them. Of course, nobody speaks Greek.If you don't know anything about Homer's texts, you have no idea that the story in this movie is something completely different than the real stuff. If you do know just a bit about the real story, watching this film is really embarrassing. You are thinking all the time... hey, this is from that chapter... no no, from that other one... oh no, that's not possible... eh eh eh... I'm not sure anymore.Who do the film makers think they can fool? Me, I guess, because I paid money to see the film in cinema. Darn. I shouldn't have done that. These people don't reserver respect for their work. Raping the Iliad, it's a shame.It's definitely not about the Iliad. It's eye candy. It's a bad movie.",3,2,7,29 December 2004
Ocean's Thirteen," How often can you fix a big problem in 2 minutes?
","Problems? Fix them in 2 minutes screen time. Winners and losers switching places every couple of minutes. Keep characters as shallow as possible, please keep them stereotypical, with a broody look on their face to try to let them look more intelligent.Add some incredible thingies, oh wait, add a lot of those. The drill that drilled the Channel Tunnel from the French side... funny, but not really, and very incredible. Put on a fake nose and you won't be recognized. Raise a guy from the dead with lame poetry. Security? What security? Half a billion worth of diamonds that cannot be stolen, and after-wards the theft turned out way too easy.I gave it a four for the couple of funny moments and another couple of good actions. Overall, this was a very disappointing film. The outcome was certain, it was told at the start.",4,2,3,1 July 2007
The Village," This could have been an episode of the Twilight Zone
","This movie is overrated and way too long. It should have been made in the style of the wonderful TV series Twlight Zone. I think the writers of that series would have made an episode of 30 minutes with this story.I have seldom been so bored as with this movie. The clue was so clear, from very early in the movie, I really can't understand what all the hype was about. Series like Twilight Zone, Buffy and Angel have clues like this in almost every episode, and have better suspense.I did laugh several times. But I'm quite sure the makers of this movie did not intend me to laugh at those times.The acting was not too bad. But the actors had to work with a silly script. And they had to be slow, dull, a bit dim even.Don't waste your time with this movie. It is slow. So very slow.",3,2,4,11 April 2005
"I, Robot"," Lots of things from Asimov books
","As a child I devoured as many Asimov books as I could. I really love the technical SF books written with a vision that promises us a bright long happy future.Bicentennial Man was not close to the story written by Asimov. I, Robot is on many points equally far away from the story. That's why the start of the movie deservedly says 'Suggested by...' and not 'Inspired by...' and certainly not 'Based on...'.But I'm quite sure that Isaac Asimov would have liked this movie much better than Bicentennial Man. So many things from his other books are included in this movie, and so many important parts of the story 'I, Robot' are included, that Asimov lovers really have to see this movie.The end is a real cliffhanger. Signs of the zeroth law (law numero 0) of robotics are being shown at the end. In later stories, Asimov added that zeroeth law, making a total of 4 laws of robotics:0) A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.1) A robot may not harm a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, except where that would conflict with the Zeroth Law.2) A robot must obey orders given it by a human being, except where that would conflict with the Zeroth and First Laws.3) A robot must protect its own existence except where that would conflict with the Zeroth, First or Second Laws. I hope they make a sequel to this movie. Maybe 'We, Robots'? With Daneel Olivaw as the main character, of course, the powerful robot from so many Asimov books, like The Foundation series. Because that's who Sonny is...",9,2,3,9 August 2004
Van Helsing," Mix of the super movies. Bad mix. Bad, bad.
","let's start with a mix of the stories of Dracula and Frankenstein. Add some eggs of Alien(s), and later on have many more. Out the eggs come Gremlins. Funny creatures. They behave really like the pixies of the Harry Potter movies, and they behave badly. There seems to be need for quite a bit from Lord of the Rings, like the maps, the horses and the nice views of snowy mountaintops. Dracula wants his ring, but is not yet calling it his precious. Add some feel and wit of Buffy and Angel episodes. Sprinkle some silly special effects and anachronisms of Wild Wild West and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Frankenstein's brain was flown in from the set of the next sequel of Silence of the Lambs. A mirror acts like a Stargate, go through it and be somewhere completely different suddenly. Some castles are moved from New Zealand, and Saruman and Sauran sorely miss them. I've seen Jack Nicholson do a better werewolf. Van can surf like Legolas, but this looks even more unbelievable. Everybody is able to perform rope-slinging like Spidey, even the lady outdoes Indiana Jones.All humans have super strength and survive blows that would kill a rhino, survive 50 yard drops that would smash the sturdiest marble.Oooh, and of course we got Faramir from LOTR, behaving silly and cowardly. And Wolverine from X-Men, behaving heroic and gentlemen-like. Rubeus Hagrid from Harry Potter is killed way too soon. M of the League is way too human and friendly to convince as a vampire. Selene of Underworld though is a good and very strong vampire killer, and how tiny is her waist, it's stunning, but it being very unpractical does of course not stop her.Ah, all ends well that ends like Ghost. No Swayze though... But the end is an invitation for a sequel. I hope it won't be made.Of course it's dark, snowing and/or raining all the time. The acting is a bit thin, it's all a caricature. The plot, well, it makes hardly any sense. The story goes ways Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley have never thought of and would certainly not approve.It's all way too silly. I give it a 3. Not a 1. But that's just because of the special effects, the costumes and the new ways of extreme violence.",3,2,4,21 January 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Magnificent, top 10 movie of all time
","After I saw the movie in cinema, I gave it a score of 9. Yesterday I got the extended edition, 4 DVD box set, as a gift, and enjoyed the 214 minutes of film. I agree with many others that this was the version I want to have seen in cinema. I don't mind sitting 214 minutes in my chair.It is a shame that so many parts were cut out in the original release, like Merry and Pippin being swallowed by Old Man Willow, the moving of the forest to help Rohan, the eating of the Orcs by this forest, the funeral of Theodred, the part where Eowyn founds out the real age of Aragorn, and much much more. This version of the movie makes more sense, more things are explained, the story is more comprehensible and logical. And above all that, the scenes that were cut out are often magnificent, in themselves better than many complete movies I've seen.The characters, the special effects, the sets, the paintings, the armory, the humor, the biting similarities with the real sad history of the world, the overwhelming music and the beautiful views of New Zealand nature: this movie contains a lot of wonderful movies, more action than most action movies, more emotions than most dramas, more story developments than most fiction movies.I re-voted and now gave a 10 for Two Towers. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I am certainly going to see this many times.I really look forward to Return of the King. I've read somewhere that it will be over 3 hours in cinema and over 6 hours on the extended edition. Next month I will join the marathon session in my local cinema, watching all three movies in a row. This is the best thing ever happened to cinema!",10,0,0,23 November 2003
I Am Legend," Awful ending of a mediocre movie
","I'm a big fan of Will Smith. In this movie, he's a mixture of a good guy and a nervous basket case who's cracking down more and more. Will Smith in a zombie movie. Outsmarted by zombies. We have seen much better zombie movies, where the zombies really look convincing, but that's not the case here.The end is really crazy. He does not want to survive with the two last survivors, but he sends them away to a surprising way out (hey, where did that come from), that would stop the zombies from following them. Will Smith could have gotten away, while still letting the hand grenade explode and let it kill the zombies.At the end, the two survivors arrive at a huge wall. Other survivors with big military power. But earlier in the movie, we saw the zombies having superhuman strength and speed. They could easily climb that wall! Ridiculous that here's a human stronghold that isn't run over by the zombies. It should be on some island, not here.",6,1,2,17 January 2008
Avatar," Beautiful but stupid
","I did read up about comments here and external reviews, before I went to see the movie. I expected a bad story and stunning visual effects. I got to see a very bad and very predictable story and I thought the visual effects were not that good.The panoramas were nice, certainly. The graphic world was nice, with the forests, the alien creatures, the huge machines and planes of the humans. But I thought it was very well visible that it all is CGI. It's animations. Why would people say that you can hardly see it's CGI... do they think we're stupid? I've seen computer games lately that look just as stunning. And in 5 years, we'll just remember this movie as 'nice graphics for its time, but the story sucks'.I agree with the reviews of Avatar being a mixture / ripoff / remake of Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, FernGully, Last Samurai, Enemy Mine, Lawrence of Arabia. Cameron did a much better job on Alien and Terminator. Did people finally convince him that his audience is stupid? I did quite a few face-palms while sitting in my chair. I started drinking a lot (thanks to our service cinema for providing this lovely feature), because I was bored. Predictable. As soon as I saw the main character sit in his wheelchair I knew: he is going to one of those Na'vi. Predictable. As soon as I saw the huge tree, I knew they were going to blow it up. Really. Barf.I still don't understand why humanity of 2154 needs a whole fleet of airplanes to cut a high tree, since we already have neutron bombs now. You want to eradicate the aliens, get the tree out of the way, and not let the public at home know you did something terrible? Throw the neutron bomb and nobody will know. The area will be easily accessible with big digging machines, because there will hardly be any radioactive fallout. I know, it's evil, but that's the way these evil humans are in this movie. But that would be a short story, wouldn't it.Go see Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Aliens, Terminator, Silence of the Lambs... or so many other films. Nice stories, some unpredictable plot changes and ditto character developments, grey (vs black&white) characters.I happily would give it a 1 / 10, but I did like the graphics. I did not like the plot, the story, the characters, the character developments.",3,7,15,27 December 2009
The Happening," The plants make wind
","Yes, the plants make wind. That wind spreads neurotoxins. These neurotoxins make people going to kill themselves. In the Northeastern part of the USA and nowhere else. This is being told to us, because, maybe, we would not understand if not being told... we see it happen and we might just not understand.At the end, a professor is being asked by a journalist on prime time TV how this could happen. He explains that this is a warning by nature. The journalist is not convinced: if it is indeed a warning, it would not only have happened here, but also elsewhere, and since so, we can give in to complot theories. The government did it! Of course, at the very end, it is happening again, in France (Paris!). Wow, a second warning, or now really the end of humankind.By the way, being in love with each other and telling other people you love them and appreciate them, might help. Save the environment, talk to plants.This really was a stupid movie. Stupid like 'Plan 9 From Outer Space', but this time with good sound and good image quality and costumes and scenery. But still, it feels like a whole reel of film was left out.Ooooohhhh, beware, the plants and trees make wind, they make the wind blow, and with that wind, the neurotoxins come your way and make you crazyyyy...M. Night Shyamalan breaks wind. I hope he never breaks anything else again.",2,11,22,12 June 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Inane destruction
","I've seen this movie with increasing disgust. It has so many sets of stupidity, I facepalmed myself every couple of minutes (now my nose hurts).The most stupid thing was Lex Luthor. No real explanation on why he did the things he did, what his company was doing, and his ramblings took too long and were filled with nonsense.I grew up with comics of Superman and Batman. Both cared for other people and always tried to cause as little damage as possible, and if they did, tried to rescue as many people as they could. Often they took the fight to an unpopulated (or less densely populated) area. In this movie, just as in Man of Steel, Superman kept the fight in the city and caused ridiculous amounts of destruction, death, and suffering. He is just evil.The movie stumbles from stupid plot to stupid plot, not explaining things (or giving explanations that were as valid as 'roses are red so all red things are roses').Batman has a wonderful plane that is so advanced I think all military in the world would want to have it. Same for his car. Jimmy Olsen is CIA, and executed at the beginning. Batman is Superman's enemy because of all the destruction in the previous movie, and slowly becomes his friend, and really, that happens in a dim way, how the hell can these two people be depicted as smart. Superman teaches the Kryptonians how to become superpeople like him. The Kryptonians know so many uninhabited habitable planets but chose Earth to terraform. It just drives me mad writing this. This movie is bad. Well, the stories are bad. The visual effects, special effects and stunts are awesome.",3,3,9,28 March 2016
