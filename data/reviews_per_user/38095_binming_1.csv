The Ring," This Movie Is All About Goose Bumps
","I swear this movie has a Chinese origin, remake or Japanese. I knew it. Tell me about little drowned girls undead in a wet dark well - I was hit the hardest.The DVD cover claims 'the best since the Sixth Sense'. Technically it is very good, clean straight horror, no hanging parts there. However there is an important difference. Sixth Sense speaks a powerful humanity, ghost or not, a palpable longing for living that is very sad and beautiful. The Ring has some good moments - the island, lighthouse, a mysterious pall reminiscent of Hitchcock's Vertigo. But it's mostly about a kind of pure, wantom evil, that after the paralyzed state I start to want badly to fight back, tooth and nail, come what may. As of the moment, millions of worms are squirming on my screen(in the DVD extra). My hair is still raising but the scare is giving way to rage, sort of. Strange to be so worked up. Rachel, handles herself admirably 7 days up to her scheduled doom, but the film detracts greatly with the end. It should be much better just with the scene in the extra, an unmarked tape beckoning ominously from the shelf. Making copies only to keep her own life - the man-eating tiger's pawn, another chinese origin!",Null,1,1,18 April 2003
