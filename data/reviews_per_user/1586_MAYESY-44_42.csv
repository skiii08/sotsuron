The Rock," Another one from the 90's
","Another brilliant film from the 90's, a great action packed film with a really good story and the perfect partnership between Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery.",10,1,1,28 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Original
",I think this is the first of a trilogy that didn't harm the Star Wars franchise like the new stuff has. The film is really great with new elements such as the pod racing and the start of how Annikin becomes Darth Vader. It has everything you want to be a Star Wars movie.,9,1,2,29 May 2020
The Equalizer," Quite brilliant
","This movie is great, an unsuspecting hero to normal people but we know his past and the way he takes everyone out to help everyone he needs to is amazingly brilliant. The story is packed full of depth with a violent edge which is amazing.",10,2,2,6 June 2020
Skyfall," The best Bond
","Personally this is my favourite Bond, it has everything you want. Great action, great story and a fantastic ending. I think you finally see that Bond can't do everything on his own and that give a greater depth to the character than just killing off people that he or the viewers doesn't care about.",10,1,4,14 June 2020
The Hangover," Never thought a hangover could be this good
",This is a genius comedy. Brilliant cast and in particular Zach who was absolutely brilliant in the film and was hilarious through out. Can't get much better than this if you want a laugh.,10,0,0,8 June 2020
Iron Man 3," Could be worse
",It's an okay movie and Iron Man will always be a good watch but it's not as good as the first or second but I think this is mainly down to the villain and the below average storyline. Robert does Robert and is still good.,7,0,0,25 June 2020
Deja Vu," Just amazing
",This is a brilliant action thriller sci-fi movie. One of the only time travel films that was brilliant through out and had an amazing ending. This is an highly recommend film and Denzil Washington is brilliant.,10,0,0,6 June 2020
Iron Man 2," 2 Iron men?
","Another really good movie, hard not to compare it to the first and in my opinion it is not as good as the first. Still really good though and good introduction of new characters and the good continuation of the ongoing story.",8,0,0,9 June 2020
World War Z," Zombie favourite
","Out of all of the zombie based films this is one of my favourites, a really good story from a different angle of a specialist rather than a hero with a gun. Brilliant ending as-well which is always a bonus.",9,3,3,5 June 2020
Hot Fuzz," Hot fuzz
","Another brilliant comedy from these two, I rate this higher than Shaun of dead but think both are really good. Rate it higher than Shaun of the dead because I think you get just as much comedy but the action and story is a little better for me.",8,0,0,8 June 2020
The Day After Tomorrow," Great survival film
","Really good film from start to finish, real thriller about survival from a natural disaster. Good cast and a great story with some real world arguments about climate change.",7,2,2,3 June 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," On your left
","I can't rave about this film enough! This is one of my favourite MCU films period. Great story line and the real start of getting this universe going. Great moments with Finding our Buckie is winter solider, Fury faking his death and coming back with his secret eye and the introduction of Falcon. This film is amazing.",10,1,1,30 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Final nail in the coffin
",I've been disappointed with Disney and the newest Star Wars trilogy and this was no different. It's like we're going round in circles and copying the same stuff which should have just been left at the return of the Jedi.,5,7,12,27 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Weakest link
",This is definitely the weakest of the three in this trilogy and doesn't really give a lot to the franchise other than an over the top romance and what it says on the tin the introduction of the clone army. The other two in my opinion are really good Star Wars films this not so much.,5,1,2,29 May 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," I can do this all day
",Brilliant movie from start to finish. Captain America is my favourite character in MCU and Chris Evans portrays everything that is good in captain America really well. Real good story and with CA and Buckie being a massive part all the way through this reall was done well.,10,0,0,16 June 2020
Armageddon," I didn't want to close my eyes
","Another one of the 90's classics! This film has everything you need in it, great cast, great story and an emotional rollercoaster of an ending, oh and one of my favourite songs to really get you in the heart at the end.",10,3,3,29 May 2020
"I, Robot"," Defining the 3 laws
","This is a really good movie with a lot going for it. Some good action, good story and a good twist at the end. I wouldn't say it is flawless in terms of acting but that's not necessarily what you are looking at in this movie.",7,0,0,8 June 2020
We're the Millers," Funny funny funny
",Brilliantly funny film and great performances all round. Some excellent moments with non stop laughing and Will Poulter performance was brilliant.,8,0,0,20 June 2020
Die Hard 2," Still brilliant
",For me it is the weakest of the Die hard original 3 but that is by no means a negative. This movie is still packed full of action With a great storyline and a good little twist as well. Bruce Willis is brilliant and still servers much credit for another great film.,9,1,1,27 May 2020
Quantum of Solace," My least favourite of Craig's
",Still a very good bond film just personally my least favourite of his. Plenty of great action I just don't think the story follows on as well as the hoped from Casino Royale.,7,0,0,14 June 2020
Independence Day," What more do you want?
","If you just had realistic films there wouldn't be many out there, I really don't get some of the reviews on here. This is a classic film of what I believe most people have imagined an alien invasion would be like. It's a great film with a great cast and a lot of different angles from different families that all come in to one heart warming fight to save the world.",10,5,6,29 May 2020
Non-Stop," Up in the air
","Doesn't matter whether Liam Neeson is in America or France, saving is son or daughter, or on the ground or in the air he still manages to deliver a good action film. This has a really good story and suspense all the way through until you find out who it is causing the problems.",8,1,1,30 May 2020
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The weak link
",In my opinion the weakest of the three Jurassic Park movies. Storyline not up to scratch and taking away the main characters of the first film was a big let down.,6,2,3,27 May 2020
I Am Legend," Will at his best
",This is one of Wills best films and one of his best acting performances. A great story line with a really sad underbelly but a near perfect ending.,9,0,0,6 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The best of a bad bunch
","I actually enjoyed this movie on a stand alone basis, it was original and had more of a new feel instead of being a copy cat version. That being said it was still no where near the standards it should be and is still apart of the worst trilogy of Star Wars films.",6,2,6,27 May 2020
Jurassic World," This is how you do it
","As a massive Jurassic park fan I was worried when they were going to bring out Jurassic world.... well I was wrong to be, this film was perfectly done a perfect balance between nostalgia and bringing a different dimension to the franchise.",10,1,1,28 May 2020
Taken," I have a specific set of skills
",This is a great film and Liam Neeson does a fantastic job with one of the greatest lines ever. Fantastic race against time film to try and get his daughter back. Great through out.,9,1,1,3 June 2020
National Treasure," Something different
","Really enjoyed this film, different type of film and interesting as a treasure hunt and all the clues to try and find the treasure. Some good laughs between the group and still some good action in it.",7,0,0,8 June 2020
Inside Man," Well thought out
","A really good thought out film and a different ending to a normal bank robbery film. Some really good parts in the film, I think I just got left wanting a bit more.",7,1,1,7 June 2020
Thor," For the love of God
","I'm always a fan of the first films with each character because of the originality. I'm watching them again from the start and Thor is not as good as Iron Man but is still a very good film. The relationship between Thor and Loki is a massive part of the MCU story and is at the forefront of this film, still really good action and continuation of the MCU.",8,0,0,10 June 2020
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Who doesn't love Die Hard
","Brilliant movie with a brilliant storyline and made all the better having Samuel L Jackson to team up with Bruce Willis, genius idea that brought even more life to the franchise.",10,1,1,27 May 2020
Con Air," Watched over and over again
",This is one of my favourite films of all time. It's just a movie I love for no particular reason but just enjoy watching over and over again. Great action packed movie with an unconventional hero.,10,1,1,28 May 2020
Hitch," Great romcom
","I think this is a really good romcom, You expect cringe and awkwardness when men are not confident and I think this portrays this well. Laughed quite a few times and a great cast, what's not to like.",8,1,1,29 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Nothing wrong here
",This was a really good end to a really good trilogy. This really sets you into a new hope if you watch it one way and if you watch it the way they came out this really ties up everything you need to know.,9,2,2,29 May 2020
Taken 2," Another one
","Another good film in the series, my least favourite of the 3 but still a good film but a bit to similar to the first one which is why I don't find it as good",7,2,2,3 June 2020
Casino Royale," Very intriguing
",I think this is quite different to other bonds in that there is significantly less action and a greater build up in the story. Very different but very good.,8,1,1,14 June 2020
Speed," The need for speed
",Really good movie full of action and suspense. Really good all the way through and you really feel the dislike between the hero and the villain so to speak which you don't always get. Unnecessary romance in the movie but you can't have everything.,8,1,1,28 May 2020
Live Free or Die Hard," Back again
","Brilliant 4th instalment to the Die Hard franchise, original and brought into the future with the cyber security aspect. Bruce Willis again delivers even thought there is more than a decade in between films.",9,1,1,27 May 2020
Thor: The Dark World," More Thor
","Really enjoyed the movie, it was different to the first but I think the films are still on par with each other I think I like this one better because Chris is well and truly perfected playing Thor, in the first I thought he was a little stiff in his acting but since then in avengers and Thor 2 he has been brilliant.",8,0,0,29 June 2020
Godzilla," Decent enough
","I personally enjoyed the film as it is but I just feel it was a little rushed and all over the place. The story wasn't explained enough and could be confusing to the younger viewer, I prefer the 98 Godzilla a lot more.",7,1,1,5 June 2020
Spectre," Good, very good
",Very good Bond film and a good storyline. Good build up at the start with enough action to keep you entertained and then a very good last 45 minutes to the film with plenty of action and a good ending.,8,0,0,28 June 2020
Law Abiding Citizen," Brilliant brilliant Butler
","Absolutely amazing film, after going through something traumatic I believe this film is what everyone would imagine doing to get revenge. Brilliantly thought out with a great twist and ending in which you don't want the guy who is getting revenge to get caught and you are on his side.",10,0,0,8 June 2020
