Scarface," What a cool movie
","This is a nice, sleazy, violent, and nerve rattling film.  This film reminds me of Abel Fererra's film King of New York; nice, sleazy, violent, and nerve rattling.  Al Pacino is excellent, as Tony Montana, the Cuban refugee, who comes from nothing, and rises to the top of drug dealing.  Pacino is over the top, and very entertaining to watch.  Also great performances by F Murry Abraham, and Robert Loggia.  Though, I could've done without Michelle Pfiefer. THEN AGAIN, her drug scenes were very convincing.  She had her good moments.  Scarface is one of the most violent, revolting, films around.  Of course, Oliver Stone wrote it.  One of DePalma's most violent, and most loved.  Lots of great camera work too.  Nice one!",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," we waited a long time for this!!
","Well, it's been a couple of years, and finally, we all got a chance to see The Phantom Menace.  I have to say that i naturally loved the movie.  But i did have a few problems with the film.I'll start with Jar Jar.  I had to admit, that he did make me laugh, but he supplied way too many jokes.  This caused the film to seemingly be geared towards the younger generation (15 younger).  Compared to the oringinal trilogy, there was plenty of humour supplied by Han, 3p0, R2, and whomever, but Phantom Menace's comedy was mostly all slap stick.  And i thought that Jar Jar was a little bit annoying.  And i had to really concentrate hard to understand what the hell he was saying.  Even the Gungan leader played by Brian Blessed, i couldn't understand him most of the time.  I was telling my friends that i think Lucas should've had them speak a totally different langauge, and give them subtitles.I thought that the acting was only mediorce.  I realized that Lucas can't really direct actors.  I want to compare Lucas to Michael Bay (armageddon). As seen in Armageddon, the acting wasn't too good, especially Bruce Willis' performance wasn't that great.  I thought that Samuel Jackson was miscast as Mace Windu, only having 2 or so scenes in the whole movie.  And Jake Lloyd was kinda annoying (YIPPEE).  Though his last scene with his mother was very heart felt, and is by far his best acting in the film.  As for Liam Neeson, and Ewan Megregor, their performances were pretty good, especial Mcgregor's with his impersonation of Sir Alec Guinness.  I was also disappointed that Darth Maul only had a few lines in the movie, though his voice was pretty cool, not to mention evil.The special effects were very well executed, though, there was just too much of it.  Practically the whole movie was special effects, or paintings, or computer images, or cartoons.  If they toned down on the effects, the film would be perfect, but then again, it wouldn't be Star Wars would it?  The light saber fight was totally awesome and exciting, and the pod race was amongst my favorite part in the film (did ya guys see Warwick Davis?[willow])As for the story, i think it was pretty good.  Some people may say that Star Wars' story is only an excuse to show case it's special effects, but i beg to differ.  I think that the whole Star Wars saga is one gigantic political war drama, set in space of course.Oh i forgot.  Natalie Portman was pretty damn hot!Even though it had a few flaws, I still thoroughly enjoyed this awesome movie!  I predict that the upcoming episodes will get even better.",Null,0,1,25 May 1999
Barry Lyndon," one word: beautiful!
","I began to be a fan of Mr. Kubrick last year, and ever since, I've constantly tried to get my hands on every film he's done.The cinematography is the most beautiful I've ever seen, next to Gone with the Wind.  The acting was tight, and generally very well done.  The adapted period music sounded great to the ear.  And the story, I found very interesting.  To me, there is a moral to this fine story by Thackery.  If you are given somthing good, don't screw everything up by taking advantage of it, or being greedy.  Though the film was very long, I, myself, did not find it boring.  (My mother fell asleep through some of it, yet she loved the story line.  And she doesn't even like long movies like Barry Lyndon.) This film can be overlooked by young fans of Mr. Kubrick, and it is a shame, because this is amongst his greatest triumphs.",Null,1,2,11 July 1999
Full Metal Jacket," one great war film!
","I love this movie!  Everything about it is awesome.  The military and atmospheric music, the acting especially R Lee Ermy's performance, the camera work, the direction, the action scenes and the massive sound amongst other things.  This vietnam picture by master director Stanly Kubrick always impresses me.  This film is split up into 2 parts.  The first part focuses on 3 marines going through boot camp in preparation for the Vietnam war. The marines are Private Joker, Private  Cowboy, and Private Gomer Pile, whom is 'so ugly you can be a modern art masterpiece' and isn't cut out to be a marine. Joker then tries to help him out, and the climax to part one is startling.  Part 2 focuses on Joker and Cowboy experience in Vietnam, and how Joker makes his first kill.  This film shows Kubricks pessimistic view of the world.  Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Ofrio, and R Lee Ermy are spectacular! Don't miss this one!",Null,0,0,6 May 1999
The Exorcist," Good Vs Evil, God Vs. Satan
","William Friedkin's film is a masterpiece.  Being, if not the scariest, the most realistic film about the subject of possession.  Mike Oldfield's Tubular bells gives me chills, along with the original music.  The state of the art sound and sound editing are superb. This film really impressed me with its sound.  The make-up was very morbid, and very well done.  The acting is just fine, especially Max von Sydow and Jason Miller's THE POWER OF CHRIST REPELS YOU sequence.  Even the dialogue is very shocking at times.  The special effects are very realistic and convincing!  They are also times of true power, moments that dig right into your heart, and move you so much, and moments that will just freak you out.  The big shame though, is that not a lot of younger generation, or at least the majority, will appreciate the movie, dubbing it boring, or, not gory. Well....If you want to see teen-trash-rip offs of Halloween-films like SCREAM. go see Scream...But if you want to see a quality-classic-well made-horror-drama film. go see THE EXORCIST.",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
The Evil Dead," a brilliant gorefest in the veins of Romero
","What I like most about this movie, is its extreme low budget.  When you first glimpse at Evil Dead, it looks like an average Late Night trash film, which it is in few ways.  But even though it is cursed with a low budget, this movie has its skills.  Spectacular camerawork, tracking shots, nice gore effects for such a low budget, and some good ol' violence.  Sam Raimi shows his trademark in overexaggerated violence, which could be found in Darkman, and Army of Darkness.  The direction is so raw, yet very well done, and the effects are very very impressive.  And Bruce Campbell foreshadows to all of us, that he would one day be a well known actor, as in Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness. All movie buffs must see this film!",Null,0,0,7 July 1999
The Piano," a truly beautiful film.
","The performances in 'the Piano' are absolutely magnificent.  This is the first Holly Hunter film i've seen, and she truly impressed me a great deal.Hunter is to marry by arrangement, a man she never met before (sam neil) and a man whom she would never learn to love.  She leaves her home, to New Zealand, along with her young daughter (anna paquin) and with her beloved piano, in which she is clung to, and the only thing she really loves. There in New Zealand, she meets Harvy Keitels character.  From there, Keitel understands that she cannot live without her piano, and they fall in love. This romance causes jealousy to Neil.  And so on.Everyone in this film is superb, especially by Hunter and young Paquin. Anna is really adorable, and her acting and accent are flawless, at such a young age!  Holly's performance haunted me. As her role required her to be a mute, and she didn't not say a word (besides her narration), i came to the conclusion that she is one of the best actresses out there, better than most actresses who actually have dialouge in their films.  Harvey proves to me, that he is a virtuoso actor, and he is more capable of more serious roles, not that i didn't enjoy him in BAD LIEUTENANT.  And Sam doesn't surprise me, as his performance was splendid.Everything else in the film was great, including the photography, the dark/bluish scenes, the direction, and especially the music.  Holly's piano playing is astonishing.  I strongly recommend this film!",Null,0,1,4 June 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," breakthrough in film history
","I remember when i was about 12 years old or so, and my father brought home a laser disc of 2001 (not in widescreen).  My father (not having seen the movie before) said, 'this is supposedly the best movie ever'.  So i didn't argue, and i attempted to watch the movie for the first time.  As all of you know, the first part of the film is THE DAWN OF MAN.  And after watching Moon-Watcher, and his group of monkeys, i left the room, disappointed, thinking it was so boring.  Later that year, I watched the movie again in it's entirety, but i wasn't impressed.At the time, i was immature in my critique, not knowing the difference between a good movie, or a bad movie, not knowing whether Plan 9 from Outerspace is better than The Day the Earth Stood Still.  So then, I grew older, having seen quality movies such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and much of Stanly Kubrick's other films which i absolutely love.  I then gave 2001 another go.  When i was young, I complained that there were no aliens, no space lasers, no spaceship battles, no explosions or any John Williamesque musical scores.  But as i grew older, I looked at the film differently, not as a run of the mill B sci fi movie (star wars) but as an artful cinematic masterpiece.  Having being young, i could not appreciate well made movies, me being more interested in Spaceballs, and the  Masters of the Universe (if you remember that He Man movie.  I then interpreted the movie differently.  I then came to my own conclusion that 2001 gave out a message that we should be careful about our own machines, and that if we make them so advanced, that it could take over us all.  And i also came to the the humble conclusion that we, humans, are far behind in technology, than extra terrestials are, and that they will always be far superior to us. But that is only my opinion.What i like about the movie so much is, that it leaves al ot for your own imagination.  Films like the Star Wars trilogy doesn't leave anything for you're imagination.  But 2001 allows you to think for yourself, which is what movies are supposed to do.  Other people complain that there is no plot.  Well I say that they are ignorant in their viewing, and they can't think for themselves, and i recommend them to watch film's like  Power Rangers, which of course has a clear story line, and the over use of special effects!!! If you sleep during this movie, or even walk out on it, then it proves that you are just impatient and you can't appreciate good films.In describing the film in general, I think everyone else had summed it up. I can only say that it is amongst Mr. Kubrick's finest films, and the finest film in movie history, and true milestone in filmmaking.  The music is superb, and the sound from the simple beeping of a button, to the deafening noise of utter silence is amazing in so many ways.  The effects are breathtaking, far surpassing that of Star Wars.  And the acting is a lot more convincing.  People complained that the acting was rather dull.  But I say to those, 'Thats how people in space act, they are isolated.  Do you think isolated people would be acting uproariously?'  The acting is just plain out accurate.  The film is also prophetic of things to come in the future.Well, I strongly recommend this picture to everyone else who hasn't seen it yet.  And to those who found it rather boring, try watching it another time, and look hard for it's messages.",10,1,3,22 June 1999
Once Upon a Time in America," truly beautiful
","I consider this film among the best of it's kind.  It is equally terrific along side with The Godfather.  It is also among Sergio Leone's best films (the good, the bad, and the ugly).This is an epic gangster film concerning 4 jewish hoodlums/pals. They are drawn into the organized crime lifestyle at a very young age.  They all hit it rich one day, and they hide they're savings.  One of the pals kills an old rival, and a police officer, and he goes to jail.  Years later, he returns to find  his friends joining in the bandwagon of the prohibition, and establishing their own speakeasy.The film includes great performances by De Niro, and Woods.  The chemistry between these 2 greats is remarkable.  Ennio Morricone's score is as memorable as The Godfather's musical score, and it stays with you for a long time.  The film is ultra violent and at times very disturbing.  Even an unexpected rape scene is included.  Nevertheless, this movie is flawless. It has a very hardcore Italian film look which makes the movie so beautiful and unique.  All film buff's must see!",Null,0,1,20 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," excellent last effort by the Master
","I love this film.  It was different from what I've heard the movie was about.  The story is pretty nuts, very original.  I won't give too much away, but what basically, Bill (tom) has a desire to cheat on his wife Alice ( nicole), and Bill stumbles upon a cult.The way the movie was made was very well done.  Stanley Kubrick, like in Barry Lyndon, used mostly natural light, to light most of the scenes.  The direction is simple, yet artistic, and Kubricks trademark steadicam movements ring true. The music is very well done, and at times, very spooky, especially the organ music during the cult sequences.  Tom and Nicoles acting is first rate, and i won't be suprised if they win oscars for their acting, especially Nicole.  Nicole's acting was very impressive.What suprised me was, that it wasn't just an erotic thriller, but I found the film to be a minor Dark Comedy.  The film was unusually funny at times, shocking other times.  The ending is just like Kubricks other films: abrupt, which i absouletly love, because you can think for yourselves what will happen next.  I predict that Eyes Wide Shut will do very well during the Oscars. I consider this one of Mr. Kubricks best! Go see this film.  You will honor Mr. Kubricks memory, and see a great artistic film at the same time!!!",Null,0,0,17 July 1999
Raging Bull," Among Martin Scorcese's best films
","This is such a beautiful movie.  I consider this to be one of Scorcese's best, along with Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Casino. Robert DeNiro is Jake LaMatta, a prize fighter, who will fight any boxer, and anyone, including his own wife and brother (Cathy Moriaty, Joe Pesci).  He attempts to win all the titles he can, fighting all the boxers he can, all the while he battles his own demons, and quarrels with his brother and wife. The scene in the prison cell is one of the most powerful performances by DeNiro I have ever seen.  All the actors are great, and the camera work is flawless.  And the violent scenes rattles your nerves.  The boxing matches are so realistic, it is almost like a documentary. Actually, the whole movie looks like a documentary.  I will even go as far as saying that this film is way more superior than Rocky, and Scorcese should've won best director, and the film should've won best film.  A cinematic masterpiece!",Null,2,2,2 July 1999
Blade Runner," Among the best science fiction films ever
","The Day the Earth Stood Still, Star Wars, 2001..and joining to the list, is Blade Runner.  Everyone basically summed up everything.  But I love this film, because of it's beautiful photography and cinematography.  The visual effects are one of the most convincing next to 2001.  and even more realistic than Star Wars.  There are it's flaws, like it being a little slow.  But is also because of the slow camera movements that make this a gem.  All the camera work is smooth, and hand held shots are nicely done. And Harrison Ford's narration are sort of lifeless in ways.  The acting ar very low key.  I also love this movie because Ridly Scott, managed to make this film, not just a sci fi, but also a detective film noir film.  THe film is generally dark, and dreary, which is a vision of the not so distant future.  All sci fi buffs must see this",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
Heat," one of the best action films I've seen in a long while!
","As I've matured as a film watcher, action movies began to bore me, with its dumb stories, big budget effects, and card board acting.  But then I watched Heat.  Of course I had a feeling it would be a good film because of De Niro and Pacino, but it wasn't just that.  The story kept me interested, and especially the action scenes were nice and tight.  And it also kept me on the edge of my seat, which hardly any movies do to me.  I was also surprised with the romance story lines, which also kept my interest.  This is my 2nd Michael Mann film I've seen, and now, I definitely plan to see the rest of his films...great one!",Null,0,0,2 May 1999
Goodfellas," Among one of the best gangster films ever
","This film is awesome. You have everything in here from violence to comedy, to realism.  Martin Scorcese proves that he is a master of his craft.  You want to see a great shot? Check out the shot where Henry Hill takes his wife through the club.Goodfellas' story is really about what goes on in mob life, and the rise and fall of a 'wiseguys' played by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta (which is by far his best performance in any film i've ever seen).Scorcese's direction is flashy, quick, and perfect.  No part in the movie is boring, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, which films like 'donnie brasco' fail to do.  The editing is absoulely perfect.  The variety of songs found in the soundtrack was masterfully chosen by Robbie Robertson (i think) member of THE BAND. (Scorcese filmed one of the concerts called THE LAST WALTZ).The violence and language were realistically done.  This may turn off some conservative film goers.  They may argue that the film is way too violent, and the language is ridiculous.  But they fail to grasp that it is the violence and language that makes Goodfellas so realistic.  Basically, if you get turned off from violence and language, you may want to avoid it, but by doing so, you're missing out on a great artistic film.  One of my favorite films!",Null,0,0,6 June 1999
