Who Framed Roger Rabbit," What we have here is absolute brilliance
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is one of those films that only comes around once in a blue moon. The special effects in this movie are simply amazing, mixing animation with humans was no easy task but in the end, it worked out beautifully. Another high point is the acting. If you didn't know better, you would think the animated cartoons really existed. Bob Hoskins gave a Oscar type performance playing Detective Valiant. Even the soundtrack was executed to perfection. This film is a must see for any Disney fan. It is a shame though, that they did not give this film a decent DVD conversion. A classic like this deserves much more than it received.",10,0,1,29 September 2000
