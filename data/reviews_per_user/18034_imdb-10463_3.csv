Sucker Punch," Visually stunning, utterly boring
","So much hype. So little substance.Do not let the opening minutes fool you. Within fifteen minutes we feel like we're in for a fantastic journey with our heroines, a movie that might have something to say.But this is not the case. We proceed through a series of beautiful set pieces which do nothing but establish the invulnerability of our heroines. Where we want to discover more about our characters, we only go through the motions of risking nothing and gaining nothing.Sure, the ideas are cool, and the special FX department throw a whole host of teenage boyhood fantasies at us. That our heroines brush them aside so quickly renders them meaningless.Fantastic visuals. Amazing cinematography. Great sound and music. Empty nothing at the end if the day.",3,3,6,7 August 2015
Watchmen," Too much material for one film
","Watchmen opened in Switzerland today and I caught one of the first screenings in Geneva.It was a disappointment.Those who've read the book will find it a shallow reflection of the original graphic novel. Some scenes are taken almost panel for panel from the book and a number of these are done very well. But the fundamental problem remains that even with over two hours running time there simply isn't enough time to explore the depth of the book. Major themes are heavily modified or completely absent, and equally often short cuts are taken. Much of the moral interest is lost and relations between the characters are hastily compressed into two or three lines of dialogue.The same hasty treatment of the themes and characters are likely to confuse those who haven't read the book. Time and location changes quickly, both forward and backward, but with little clue to the viewer as to what is happening. We're given no reason to care about the characters, and the plot is tediously slow until it is suddenly explained in exposition at the end.It evoked a couple of short laughs but for most of the film the audience was silent. As soon as the film finished everyone headed straight for the exit. Not a good sign.Maybe a new, longer cut will repair some of the glaring flaws in this release. Until then, you'll have more fun reading the book.",6,4,13,4 March 2009
Centurion," Not great, or even good
","Neil Marhall has brought us some fantastic movies. but this is not one of them.The Scottish scenery is stunning, but there is little else to recommend this aimless amble through an alternative history of the Romans stopping in Northern England. The formulae are well worn and but the plot never really seems to work out what it wants to be: Is it an action movie, a buddy movie against the odds, a political thriller, or a forbidden romance? It's simultaneously all and none, everything is touched upon but nothing is developed. Ultimately it leaves the viewer as unsatisfied as its threads of plot.Sure, watch it on DVD, but don't expect much more than a bit of gore and a half-hearted effort at a decent movie. 4/10.",4,6,15,23 August 2010
