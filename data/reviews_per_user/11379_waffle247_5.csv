Sucker Punch," In short: I feel gypped
","I watched this movie because I thought it would be action packed sci-fi. I was a little worried by first few minutes as it seemed to be starting off a long way from anything in the trailer. It then began to jump around a hell of a lot, first the lead goes to the mental home, then it's an orphanage, then it's a bordello. Oh well, I can cope with that. Then she starts dancing... but wait! What's this? When she dances she closes her eyes and ends up in a fantasy world.... cue action sequences that have no bearing on the plot. This goes on for a long time. Then we find out she's been lobotomised and the entire film is all in her head. The end.'Well' I thought to myself 'That was a big kick in the teeth' The sad thing is it really could have worked but in order to give us the kick in the teeth ending of 'it was all a dream' much of the direction, script and plot is misleading, contradictory and completely pointless. I don't see why this movie is being raved about by some. It's got nothing going for it but a great trailer made from all the action sequences that have no bearing on the plot at all.",2,4,11,7 April 2011
Source Code," I tried to like this movie... and failed.
","I watched this movie hoping for a nice thriller with a few sci-fi elements. I worked out who the bomber was (my girlfriends first guess!) in the first few minutes. I worked out the lead role was already dead within the first 15 minutes. It was obvious that the woman opposite him on the train was the love interest from the first scene she was in.It was obvious the bomb was in the toilet air vent.The explanation (when it finally arrived) was incoherent and made no sense, even if what they were saying was possible. So I spent an enjoyable half hour doing the crossword and waited for this poorly crafted, badly executed boring movie to end. It carried on. It went on for a lot longer. It got to the twist.... oh wait I already figured that out at the beginning. It ended. I was happy then. Please Hollywood, if you can't be bothered with the science, just stick to the fiction.",4,28,57,7 April 2011
Ready Player One," Hollywood just does not get movies anymore.
","If you've read the book, you will hate this movie. If you have not read this book but have seen any other movie ever, you'll probably still think this movie is pretty poor.It's a great story (in the book) but they mangled it so much only the general synopsis & character names are the same. It's soulless pop-culture references are thrown together with no logic or charm, clearly the screenplay had no geeks to give helpful advice like 'Halo is poop for jocks so don't reference it, unless you are going to have the lead geek disparage it.' I'm not hating on Halo but I'm questioning why they didn't reference Skyrim, Doom or something more geeky & less obvious.The casting was quite bad, a typically Hollywood cast of good looking wood & painted plastic. Given this is a story about geeks it was very strange to see how pretty they all are. Obviously future geeks will spend more time in the gym than at their computer. Not a single memorable performance given in the entire thing, the Simon Pegg narration was about the best performance of the lot & I'd say that was one of Pegg's most forgettable moments.Most of the added plot points don't make sense which combines with illogical story telling to render the ending haphazard & unsatisfactory, It felt rather bolted on in the typical Spielberg way. He's a good director but a terrible story teller & he really needs someone to explain that having money + directing talent does not make one a good creative writer.I give this a 4 because the CGI was very good, the set scenes were well placed & they did get the world (real & virtual) very accurate to the descriptions in the book. That being said this shouldn't have been called Ready Player One & the character names should have been changed.",4,1,4,11 January 2019
Bird Box," Questions but no answers.
","Lot's of questions raised that never get answered, characters act without motivation or cause. Random nutters making the situation worse just because they can. I sat through it just because the performances are really good & I hoped that there would eventually be some kind of explanation. There are no answers, only more questions & plot holes. Really this is just a very lazy horror story that borrows heavily from horror tropes, cliches & it's current peers. The lack of proper explanation really detracts from the performances of such a great cast.",3,483,823,22 December 2018
The Witch," Bad lighting & a loud soundtrack
","I'm pretty sure half the visuals in the film were hidden by bad lighting. The same goes for the dialog, either the backing music (cliche horror scream-chorus) was to loud or the actors were mumbling. From what I gleaned of the rest of it, a slow burner to nowhere. I gave up about half way through because the score had a constant whine to it that felt like simulated tinnitus, & the scenes had apparently devolved into children shouting each others names in scared voices whilst carrying candles (there may have been other things in the scenes but it's hard to tell as they appeared to be lit by candle light then darkened with a filter post production).It felt like someone was trying very hard to make a cult classic horror but I think if you take off the soundtrack it would be obvious the movie is more a period drama with paranoid people. I can't say I noticed much of a plot... at one point there was a rabbit that was clearly scary because of the ominous music, perhaps some sort of Monty Python homage that was so deadpan I missed it. TL,DR: Turn up the brightness on your screen if you want to see what's happening.",1,3,6,25 March 2018
