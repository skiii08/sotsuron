Minority Report," Solid movie with a negative for widescreen tv owners
","I liked the movie well enough. However, be aware that if you own a widescreen tv, the widescreen DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic format instead of the standard 1.85/1 format.  This means that it wasn't made for widescreen tvs, or more accurately, it wasn't adjusted for them. As a result, you will have the top and bottom black bands on your widescreen tv. That was just slightly disappointing for me, although I guess it means it was exactly like shown in the theater instead of minorly adjusted.",Null,0,0,24 February 2003
Citizen Kane," great picture, but boring
","It has all the elements that makes a picture great and yet I found it incredibly boring.  I'm sorry, but the story did not have enough to keep my interest.  Historically, it was a very important film and broke ground for future narratives, but I am happy I will only have to sit through it once in my life. Sorry.",5,3,9,27 August 1999
