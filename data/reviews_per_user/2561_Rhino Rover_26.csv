Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," realistically...
","I've read through quite a few of the reviews and the opinions seem to generally lean on the favorable side...but the impression that I get is that most of these favorable reviews are from fairly die-hard SW fans. First off, I have to admit that I am a SW fan but I will try to present an unbiased opinion. I saw the first movie when I was nine so, basically, I grew up with Star Wars. I had to approach this movie with an open mind as I knew getting caught up in the hype would only result in a movie that could not possibly live up to the expectations that I would have had.The biggest feature of this movie is the special effects. There is no doubt that George Lucas is known first and foremost as a special effects wizard and he does not disappoint in this movie. In fact, some of the effects were so well done that I did not even notice them right away. GL's creation of a whole other world/universe was an incredible success and definitely created the illusion of reality.The biggest drawback was Lucas's decision to have the alien creatures speak in english. A far greater effect would have been made if these creatures spoke in their native tongues with the movie subtitled. This was done in the first set of movies and definitely created the effect of realism. By having the alien creatures speak in english, it tended to take away from the SW feel. In some cases, some of the creatures accents sounded a little bit ethnic or to the opposite extreme, a bit too 'American' (one of the announcers in the pod race scene).This movie catered to both the young and the old and in Lucas's situation, it is a difficult decision to make as leaning too much in either direction would alienate audience groups. The inclusion of Jar Jar created a comic relief that was slightly different from the Ewoks but nonetheless effective. I think that if he had chosen a slightly more grown up voice and personality (while maintaining Jar Jar's innocence) not that many viewers would have found him as annoying. In fact, it probably would have allowed the audience to understand Jar Jar's race and his personal plight. The voice suggestion could have been applied to many of the creatures that GL created. It's amazing what a voice can do to the believability of a character.Neeson did an admirable job of Qui-Gon but it could have been better. He did make his character a believable Jedi Master though. McGregor did about as well as he could considering he was basically a secondary character with very few and short lines. I am sure this will change in the next two movies as it will definately revolve around his character and character development will be essential. Portman was a little stoic as the queen and as a result it was hard for the audience to feel any sympathy for her role as a ruler of a world under attack. On the flip side, her portrayal of the queen's aid (I know, I know, she was actually the queen when she went with Qui-Gon to Anakin's village) was performed a lot better as she was allowed to play a character with a little more feeling. Quite surprisingly, the character that I found the most believable was Watoo, the junk yard dealer. Maul's involvment was effective but it would have added more to the film if he had a bigger role. He was probably one of the few characters that everyone wanted to know and see more of.Overall, the movie was entertaining but it did lack a bit of the Star Wars feel to it. Rest assured the next movie will be even more entertaining. Too bad we have to wait 3 years for it. 7/10.",7,58,116,21 May 1999
Training Day," Dark and intriguing
","I've always thought that Denzel Washington was/is a wonderful actor. He's proven it time and time again but he has always played morally true characters or the typical Hollywood `good guy' so when the `Training Day' trailers first came out I was really looking forward to seeing Washington portray a completely opposing character. Training Day literally takes place over the span of one day. A young patrol cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) gets his big chance to further his career goal of becoming Detective by working with the legendary Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). This man's reputation precedes him and has been responsible for over 15,000 man years of incarceration based on his investigations and Hoyt is now getting his chance to work in Harris's squad. Hoyt finds out that Harris is as tougher than his reputation and quickly begins learning the ropes of street justice but to the contrary of everything he's learned and devoted his life to. `To Serve and Protect' now takes on an entirely new meaning.You know I really hope that Denzel Washington does more of these types of roles. I'm always amazed at his acting skills but he always plays the same type of character. Whether that was a career choice or not, it was very refreshing to see him finally play a more `evil' character per say. In this case, the role was even more amazing in that Harris isn't so much evil but that he has his own outlook on how justice should be handled. In some instances you actually begin to agree with his outlook and root for him. I have never seen Washington give a poor performance. He acts with an intensity that very few other actors have and dives into his character with reckless abandon.What surprised me even more was Ethan Hawke. I've never been a huge fan of his and I sometimes find his characters hard to believe because of his boyish looks. But in this movie they seem to work. He comes across as a young ethical patrol cop trying to make his way to Detective. Throughout the movie he has his morals and ethics challenged by Washington's character and frequently he caves into Washington's dominance. This worked very well and made the movie interesting but more importantly Hawke make his character believable. I was impressed by his performance in this movie.There was a nice little scene with Cliff Curtis (Smiley). I saw this actor in `Blow' and really like his performance there. Hopefully he doesn't get typecast but he was very good in the character he played here. I guess if there's on thing to get picky about was the storyline. It seems a little extreme to have only one day to make or break making a new squad but in the context of the story, this works. Especially when you know the motives behind Washington's character. Overall, this was a dark entertaining movie. If for nothing else, see this movie to see Denzel Washington play a bad character. You'll be surprised and impressed.",8,1,11,13 October 2001
Erin Brockovich," very very good
","There have been quite a few true-to-life movies made in the past year and a half and most have been fairly mediocre in the entertainment department. What can I say about this movie? Well, nothing bad if that's what you're wondering. Julia Roberts' enormous on screen presence and her trademark billion watt smile could have potentially overshadowed the story and everyone else in this movie...but it didn't. This movie was entertaining from start to finish.Erin Brockovich (played by Julia Roberts) is a single mom down on her luck. Despite repeated efforts to land a job she always ends up being rejected. She has a very minimalist way of dress and her skills in the social graces department are a little on the lacking side but her determination and resourcefulness ultimately land her a job with a law firm. Not too soon after her employment she begins to work on a case. What should have been a routine file/case prep turns out to be something more. After a little research, Brockovich discovers many peculiarities about the case and, with her boss's permission, begins to look into matters a little deeper. Despite her appearances, this woman is obviously very bright. She is not above using questionable means to get what she needs and will not take any bullying from anyone, including her boss. As her investigation continues she discovers that a large corporation is trying to cover-up their illegal dumping practices by offering to buy all the property surrounding one of their plants. Hundreds of people who live in the area are inflicted with life threatening diseases and Erin discovers that the two are not unrelated. The rest of the story depicts the progression of the case but beyond the case, you will find yourself riveted to this woman's dynamic and interesting character.Although the movie focuses around Brockovich's work on this case, the director does an even better job showing this woman's personality. You see this woman pass through the whole gamut of emotions and her effect on those around her. Having never met the real Brockovich, I have no frame of reference but if Roberts' performance is any indication, this is one interesting lady. I've seen most of Roberts' films and I have to say without a doubt, this is her best work yet. Unfortunately this movie came out a little late or I believe you have seen Julia Roberts' name listed as one of the Oscar nomination for 'Best Female Actor'.This movie wouldn't have been anywhere near this good if Roberts' didn't have an excellent supporting cast. This is especially the case for two actors, Albert Finney (plays Ed Masry - Brockovich's boss) and Aaron Eckly (plays George - Brockovich's boyfriend). Quite a bit of the more emotional scenes that Roberts is involved in includes one of these two actors and I found them to be very well done. Especially the chemistry that supposedly exists between Brockovich and her boss, Masry. This definitely shone through in the movie in particular the ending. You'll know what I'm talking about.I can't say enough good things about this movie. There's something here for everyone and the nice thing about this movie is that it does a good job telling the story but also developing the characters. Go see it.A",Null,0,1,21 April 2000
Fight Club," mind twistingly awesome
","I talked to a close friend of mine recently about this movie and he indicated that I absolutely had to see it. At his urging, I saw this movie today and I'm still not quite sure what to say. I thought I was going to see a movie about fighting (which there was plenty of) but somewhere along the way, this movie took my brain and twisted it all up. Walking out of the theatre, I didn't know which way was up and everything around me seemed so surreal after this movie.For those of you who don't know what this movie is about, here is a brief summary...as best as I can describe. Even now, I still have a hard time trying to coherently describe the storyline. This was one of the very few movies that I could not tell where the story was heading so I don't want to ruin it for you by telling you too much. The Fight Club is told through the eyes of a young man (Edward Norton) who suffers from insomnia as well as hating everything about his life. He tries to find himself by attending different suppport/addiction meetings and discovers that he can let himself go and is able to open up and bond with strangers. Not too soon afterwards on a business trip, he meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Through an unusual circumstance, Norton's character (who incidentally doesn't have a name) end up living together. As you quickly become aware of, Durden's character is almost the opposite of Norton's character. Everything that Norton's character wants to be Durden is and through this unusual friendship, the two create a secrete underground society called 'The Fight Club'. This club's purpose is for men who are trapped in their mundane pointless lives to come together and release stress by fighting each other. The club has a very strict set of rules that create form and structure for the members yet at the sametime allow them to release their frustrations and aggression. Everything, in it's own twisted way, seems to be going fine but as the movie progresses, Norton's character realizes that things (in addition to Durden) are starting to get out of hand. He tries to regain control of the situation and realizes that things are not what they seem.The two main actors in this movie (Norton and Pitt) are fantastic. Edward Norton's portrayal of an insecure, conservative young man is very well done. In fact you don't realize the how well a job he does until the end of the movie. Brad Pitt plays the neurotic character of Tyler Durden equally well. The chemistry between the two of them is very evident and definitely adds to the entertainment of this movie. The supporting actors turn in good performances as well but most of the focus is around Norton and Pitt.The one thing that I can tell you about this movie is that there is a lot going on. Almost everything that happens is representative of something so when you watch this movie, make sure you pay attention. You may not understand everything at the time but it all becomes very clear at the end. But as I hinted at the beginning, it is a very cerebrally twisted movie. It definitely makes you think about what the human mind is capable of and what it isn't. The scary thing is that this movie points more towards what the mind is capable of doing than not doing.The movie is long but the ending is definitely worth it. Overall, I would recommend this movie to any adult. There is A LOT of graphic violence and is not for the faint of heart or the squeemish but if you can handle this type of thing then definitely go see it. You will enjoy it and even if you don't, the ending will make it worth your while.A",8,0,1,9 January 2000
The 13th Warrior," Sweeping
","This was one Michael Crichton book that I have not read but I probably will after seeing the movie. The '13th Warrior' is based on the Crichton book, 'Eaters of the Dead', which in turn I believe is based on a Viking legend, and if the movie was any indication, the book must be fantastic.
The story revolves around a group of Norsemen (Viking) warriors that have volunteered to a request for help from one of their neighbouring villages. Antonio Banderas' character is an ambassador from Bagdad that has come to this group of warriors to observe their culture and customs (I will let the movie describe the circumstances to his arrival). His timing couldn't have been worse as not long after he joins up with this group of warriors they recieve a request for help. As a result, 13 warriors must volunteer for this mission and by the luck of local customs, the 13th warrior cannot be of Norse decent, which means, Banderas is automatically selected to join them. The rest of the story I will let you see for yourself.The cinematography is absolutely wonderful. The sweeping shots of the land show the ruggedness and mystery of the country and in some cases it feels somewhat like a documentary, which adds to the realism of the story. The beginning of the movie starts out with much of the dialogue spoken in the Norsemen's native language with no subtitles. What is spoken is not of great importance as what you're supposed to observe is the cultural interactions between the warriors. But as Banderas' character is slowly integrated into the plot, the director chooses an absolutely wonderful way of making the transition from the native tongue to english. To me, this was definately one of the creative highlights of the movie. This is one film where I have to stress that the dialogue is very good. I found that every line spoken was of significance to the story and often revealed insight into what the main characters were thinking and feeling. Although Antonio Banderas was billed as the lead actor, he did not dominate the movie. In fact, his charactor had more of a supporting role that was there to document the mission. The movie did a very good job of focusing around the warriors as a group and gave enough attention to each of the main characters to allow the audience to gain an insight into their personalities. The acting was very good. Every character was played very well and definately created an authenticity to them. There is quite a bit of graphic violence so if you are the 'faint of heart' type, you might want to consider a different movie. Despite many of the positives that I've mentioned there are some points that should be noted. This movie does have a religious tone to it so if you are a religious person, keep in mind that you are watching a movie about another culture's take on religion. Also keep in mind that this story is based on a folklore/legend, which means that not everything is going to make sense. Most of the story does but there are things that don't lend itself to logic but if you pick every little thing out, you will end up ruining the movie. Also, there are some parts of the battle scenes that take place in very dim lighting which make it hard to see but I have a feeling this was done on purpose to add realism. Overall, I found this to be a very gripping and entertaining movie. I also think that 'Eaters of the Dead' would have been a more intriguing title....9/10.",9,0,0,2 September 1999
X-Men," Surprisingly Entertaining.
","So was this movie adaptation of a comic book series going to be a success? Or just something corny and clichÃ© ridden? You know what? I held reservation on it even after I saw the trailers for it and was greeted with an awesome movie! The trailers looked good but the movie was even better.X-men is a comic series with many characters and plots but this particular movie dealt with the rescue of Rogue (Anna Paquin). Rogue is a young girl who discovers that she's a mutant and is forced to leave home for fear of being discovered and ostracized. She ends up in northern Alberta, Canada where she inadvertently meets and saves the life of a brooding angry man by the name of Logan, otherwise known as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The two end up at an institute for the gifted run by Dr. Xavier and the story launches into the comic book world of superheroes. `Spawn' was another comic series turned movie that left a sour taste in my mouth and left me with a bit of trepidation. What made this movie good? A good concrete storyline with special effects that enhanced the characters and ultimately the story, not a substitute for a story. Although there were plenty of special effects, the movie used it mainly for creating the personalities of the main characters. The most popular character was probably Wolverine and Hugh Jackman did not disappoint. This is the first time I've seen him in a Hollywood movie and he definitely held his own. Patrick Stewart as Xavier was the perfect casting as was Ian McKellan as Magneto. Both actors have very powerful presences on screen and made it a pleasure to watch.The one thing that I have to say that made this movie a little harder to follow at times was the number of characters. There were so many of them that it occasionally spread itself thin in some of the character development department, especially with some of the villain characters but I'm sure that this will change as in the sequels (there were enough hints of it). Overall, a great movie!",Null,0,0,30 July 2000
"Monsters, Inc."," cute, amazing, very good
","It's amazing how far CGI acting has come. I've accused some movies of having gone too far with the use of Computer Generated Images (CGI) and leaning on it a bit too much but in this case, the movie was all CGI and so it should be. Monsters, Inc. is basically a good old-fashioned cartoon, just tens times better than anything we used to watch as kids. And the interesting thing is that cartoons are no longer for children. More and more of these animated movies are appealing to the adults as much as they are to the children. Monsters, Inc. is about something that every child knows aboutmonsters in their closet. We've all had our own monsters that we were terrified of as a child and they always seem to come from that spooky closet in our room. How did these monsters get here? What are they doing here? Monsters, Inc. takes us into the world of bedroom monsters. Every closet in every child's room in the world is connected to the monster world. While the children don't really get anything out of having the daylights scared out of them, the monster's world is powered by the screams they generate out of children. Everyday, some monsters' jobs are to go and generate power by going around to the human children of the world and scaring thembut the one thing that is absolutely not permitted is for a child to enter the world of monstersWhy was this movie so good? Lots of things. They have fantastic actors as voices for the characters. John Goodman plays the main character of Sulley (big blue furry monster) with Billy Crystal playing Sulley's buddy and sidekick, Mike Wazowski (one-eyed gumball looking fellow). With actors like these two fellows, it's hard not to have good material to work with and I wouldn't be surprised if Billy Crystal adlibbed some of his lines.
What also added to the quality of this movie was the ability to capture the emotions and expressions of these characters. Unlike animation of the past, computers have been able to mimic human emotions and expressions with great accuracy. This has allowed for the audience to feel closer and relate to these fantasy actors and create an overall more enjoyable experience.Sometimes technology gets in the way of storytelling. It's happened in lots of movies where Hollywood thought that it could rest on the crutches of technology in place of a good storyline. Monsters, Inc. doesn't have this problem. On a basic level, the story is simple. The monster world is turned upside down when a little human child accidentally enters their world. But what the movie has been able to achieve beyond that is create a story that has good believable characters, even if they are fictional. The characters carry the emotions of what they face across the screen to the audience and the more the audience believes them, the better the story is. It's also nice to see that the humor is not just targeted at young children. I quite often heard adults laughing louder than the children and that's a good sign that the movie is appealing to everyone. I don't have any children but the friends that I went with all enjoyed this movie.Overall, this was a very good movie. The animation was amazing, the voice actors were excellent and the story was entertaining. Go see it.",9,0,1,25 November 2001
Notting Hill," Charming
","When this movie first came out I wasn't sure if I was interested in seeing it, hence I stayed away from it for quite a while. Having nothing to do last night, I decided to go see it and I have to say that I found this movie to be incredibly charming.The story is about how a major movie star (Roberts) wanders into an obscure little travel book shop in Notting Hill one day and becomes somewhat intrigued by the shop owner (Grant) and vice versa. Through some intelligent writing, the two meet again the same day by chance and the story takes off from there. The relationship does not develop instantly as Roberts' character has to deal with her status as a major celebrity and keeps her guard up but little by little she opens up to Grant. The story continues throughout the movie showing the on again off again relationship and the awkwardness that exists as Grant tries to deal with this situation. The ending is predictable, as it is with most romantic comedies, but the journey that the audience goes through is amazingly more entertaining than the other romantic comedies that I've seen. As with other movies of this genre, it is endearing and humorous, but what separates this movie from the others, is the incredible witt of the writing. The humor is laced throughout very frequently and when you're not laughing, you're truely caught up in the emotions that the characters feel as they try to work out the awkward situation that they feel. The only criticism that I can state is that the ending seems to be wrapped up a little too neatly and hastily but that may more to do with time constraints than anything.Overall, I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise that women will definately like but men will also enjoy very much....8/10.",8,0,0,18 July 1999
American Pie," Fun & Funny
","This movie did what WWW couldn't. It was entertaining from start to finish. Although this movie follows on the foot steps of Austin Powers 2 and Big Daddy, I found that it was thoroughly more entertaining. The humor is not intellectual by any stretch of the imagination (and it wasn't meant to be) but it was well written and more importantly, well delivered.The movie revolves around a group of friends that make a pact with each other that they would all lose their virginity by their prom night. What starts out as a group of guys trying every trick in the book to bed a girl turns out to be a self discovering journey that is riddled with humor that keeps you laughing right up to the closing credits. While there are those out there that may criticize this movie on its content, keep in mind that it is rated R and makes no attempt to hide that fact. Parents may be offended but the reality is that this movie does depict what many teenagers go through during the final year of high school.All the actors portrayed their roles admirably and a large part can be attributed to good writing. This movie will attract a lot of the teenage crowd (at least those that can get in) but I'm sure that adult audiences will find it just as entertaining. This movie will definitely be compared to 'Something About Mary' and the simple truth is that AP is much funnier and well worth the full admission.",9,0,0,9 July 1999
Cast Away," Some very good acting
","This is one of the most unusual and enjoyable movies I've seen in a while. For almost 95% of the movie there's only one actor, two if you want to count a volleyballand in a way he/it does become a very significant character. Why did I enjoy this movie so much? Tom Hanks. Need I say more? Ok, maybe Wilson the volleyball. He was pretty good too; strong silent type. Actor of few words.Tom Hanks plays a FedEx executive sent to Russia to setup the first courier operation the country has ever seen. His life revolves around the clock and following very specific rules. There is no such thing as basically being on time. You're on time or you're notand you better be on time. He comes back from this trip and we're briefly introduced to his personal life. We meet his fiancé (played by Helen Hunt) and get a very brief glimpse of the life he leads away from FedEx. Shortly after his arrival to the US, he is called away again on another trip. After a hasty good-bye, he's on the plane to his next destination. We all know what happens next and basically for the rest of the movie so I'm not going to go into any more detail about the story. 	 Making a movie with primarily one character in it is kind of a risky venture but this movie proved that it can be done. Tom Hanks is proving why he's one of the best actors in the business with this movie. It's amazing the amount of stress he puts on himself with the physical changes he goes through to make this movie look authentic. There isn't a lot of dialogue either. Hanks has been able to marvelously show the transformation a person goes through when isolated from the rest of society for a long period of time. There are many moments in the movie where Hanks doesn't say a word but is able to communicate so much to the audience. My favorite is when he's sitting on his haunches looking at the remains of a port-a-potty that washed up thinking of how to best use it. It's a very simple scene yet Hanks is able to say so much without ever uttering a word. The few weaknesses that I did see revolved around the ending. I guess with a movie of this nature, there are only so many ways to tie it up. Either the character remains stranded on the island forever or he gets rescued. They chose the latter for this movie but to me, it seemed anti-climatic. The ending was tied up a bit neatly but they did try to incorporate a bit of a human interest into it by having a problem arise between Hanks character and Hunts character. It's not overly interesting and I won't spoil it for you but trust me when I say that you will be amazed by the portion of the movie that revolves around Hanks time on the island. Overall, I'd say this movie is definitely worth seeing on the big screenand it should be seen on a big screen. There are too many quiet, subtle instances that you will miss if you watch it on a TV. It's worth the price of full admission.",9,0,0,6 April 2001
The Fast and the Furious," Who needs good writing when you have fast cars and big crashes??
","Depending on the age group you fall under, you may or may not like this movie. But then again, that's true of a lot of movies but this one seemed to have a very specific target audience and it seemed to be between the ages of 17 to 23 and predominately male. I fall outside of this age group but it doesn't mean a bad reviewit just means that it's not going to be a good review either. Well, it might. I guess you'll just have to read to the end of the review to find out. Typically movies aimed at this target audience tend to be high on the stunts and low on just about everything.Fast and Furious is about cars. Fast cars to be specific. And not the type that belongs on the race track but the kind that gets you arrested for going a zillion miles an hour down a city street in the middle of the night. This movie is about a young man that enters the underground life of street racing. Something that happens in every city. But apparently this past time is rather cliquish and getting in with the `in-crowd' isn't always easy nor does everyone accept you. It's not that different than belonging to a gang it seems. Get in with one group and you're the enemy of another group, which means that you're going to have the typical `turf war' issues. You're also going to have your `boy meets sister of big bad brother' side story and all the other issues that go along with it. There's a bit of a twist but nothing that I haven't seen in other gang/drug related movies that have something to do with young people. In fact this movie reminded me a lot of `Point Break' except I enjoyed that movie.If it sounds like I'm not really all that enthused about the plot line it's because I'm not. There was really nothing that was too terribly original about the storyline. In fact, if you look at the trailers, you'd think this movie was based on the video game `Need for Speed'. The colors used and the cars involved could have easily come out of that game and the characters? Definitely could have been taken out of a video game. The writing was full of clichés and the delivery of them wasn't overly well done. At some points I thought to myself `Did he actually say that?? That's so cheesy!' or `Please don't say that next line, please, please, please!' but they did. Not enough time was spent on developing the relationships we see. We're just kind of told about them but not in a way that really enlightens us, just that this relationship exists so accept it. So far this review is sounding pretty negative isn't it? Well, I have to say that the stunts were kind of interesting. The car chase scenes (and there's a lot of them) were pretty well done and some of the scenes they do with the semi-trucks were interesting but not all that believable.
So you're wondering, is there anything worth seeing about this movie? Hmmm, maybe depending on if you fit that target group I was talking about. If you have a hot car and like to see some hot cars with neat toys and some street racing, then this movie's for you. Other than that, I wouldn't really see it. The dialogue alone would make you want to get pulled over for road rage.",6,0,1,26 July 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Excellent but not a martial arts film
","You know what I find so appropriate about the title of this film? It has managed to stay hidden in the background from critic eyes and yet it literally crouched up onto the competition and take everyone by surprise at the last minute. If you look at all the films selected for Oscar nominations, every one of them has been playing in the theatres for a long time or has been a major box office hit. The only film that is remotely similar in feel is Chocolat and at best it is a long shot to win Best Picture. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came onto the seen not too long ago and not with a lot of marketing hype and yet it has managed to garner the second most Oscar nominations next to the goliath film, Gladiator. This alone should say a lot about the film but if you want more, just ask anyone who has seen the film. Chances are they will say they liked it.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not a martial arts film despite popular belief. There is martial arts in it but it is not a martial arts film. The movie is about love, honor and loyalty. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a legendary warrior and the guardian of a powerful sword. In preparation to retire from military life Bai decides to put the sword in the protection of a governor. Intertwined with this storyline is Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), Bai's long time friend. The audience is allowed a glimpse of the underlying love that exists between the two but an archenemy, Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) complicates life by trying to steal the sword. To help her is her apprentice Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) who we find has a history of her own. The film revolves around the sisterly relationship that develops between Lien and Yu but the director (Ang Lee) lets us see the love stories that revolve each of these characters. If it sounds like a complicated storyline, I apologize but Lee has been able to tell it beautifully and has also done what few directors dared to do: make women the strong central characters.The cinematography is beautifully shot. The audience is given a sense of the magic about the land and the history behind it. The fight scenes are more of dance sequences than pure fights and I have to say they are quite dazzling. Although for many, the wirework will be a little hard to get used to, it is integral to the feel of the film. For those who think that the wirework was a bit far fetched, keep in mind that this is a fable. Nothing about it is meant to be real and don't forget, nothing about Matrix was real either but to use state of the art special effects on a film like this would only take away from the story. I've been watching films like these all my life and I can say wirework has always been a part of films like these.This is a beautiful film but for you hardcore critics out there, if you look for flaws, you will see them whether they're really there or not. Take this film for what it was meant to bea story about a legend, inner strength and undeniable honor.Alan",10,0,0,5 April 2001

This alone should say a lot about the film but if you want more, just ask anyone who has seen the film. Chances are they will say they liked it.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not a martial arts film despite popular belief. There is martial arts in it but it is not a martial arts film. The movie is about love, honor and loyalty. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a legendary warrior and the guardian of a powerful sword. In preparation to retire from military life Bai decides to put the sword in the protection of a governor. Intertwined with this storyline is Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), Bai's long time friend. The audience is allowed a glimpse of the underlying love that exists between the two but an archenemy, Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) complicates life by trying to steal the sword. To help her is her apprentice Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) who we find has a history of her own. The film revolves around the sisterly relationship that develops between Lien and Yu but the director (Ang Lee) lets us see the love stories that revolve each of these characters. If it sounds like a complicated storyline, I apologize but Lee has been able to tell it beautifully and has also done what few directors dared to do: make women the strong central characters.The cinematography is beautifully shot. The audience is given a sense of the magic about the land and the history behind it. The fight scenes are more of dance sequences than pure fights and I have to say they are quite dazzling. Although for many, the wirework will be a little hard to get used to, it is integral to the feel of the film. For those who think that the wirework was a bit far fetched, keep in mind that this is a fable. Nothing about it is meant to be real and don't forget, nothing about Matrix was real either but to use state of the art special effects on a film like this would only take away from the story. I've been watching films like these all my life and I can say wirework has always been a part of films like these.This is a beautiful film but for you hardcore critics out there, if you look for flaws, you will see them whether they're really there or not. Take this film for what it was meant to bea story about a legend, inner strength and undeniable honor.",10,0,0,15 February 2001
For Love of the Game," Touching
","Although many of the Hollywood films have a very 'American' feel to it, 'For Love of the Game' practically defines the United States. This movie shows almost every aspect of the American culture and their obsession with sports but beneath this baseball exterior is a movie about how an individual deals with change.The story revolves around Billy Chapal (Kevin Costner). Billy is the star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and has spent his entire career with the team. We meet Billy late in his long but distinguished career and it seems that time has finally caught up with him. His body is starting to show signs of age and in the final game of the year against the New York Yankies, circumstances dictate that he must decide whether he wants to continue to play (possibly on another team) or retire. Throughout this final game, the movie flashes back to snippets of his life revolving around his career, friends and a woman named Jane (Kelly Preston). Jane is a woman that Billy meets 5 years prior to this time and these flash backs show the relationship between the two of them and the role that baseball plays in Billy's life.This is possibly one of Kevin Costner's best performances. Although he has done many different roles, baseball seems to be one that he's most comfortable in. This is his third baseball movie and I have to say that I found this one to be his best. In many of Costner's movies, I have always found that he sometimes has a very unemotional or 'stoney' performance but this is not the case with this movie. In many instances, I found his display of emotions very true and on occasions you get a lump in your throat. Kelly Preston is exceptional in this movie as Chapal's girlfriend and we definitely see chemistry between the two actors. This movie is not only about Chapal's life. There is enough development by the director to give insight into Preston's character and her life that you feel what she feels. The peripheral actors also give very good performances, especially John Reilly who plays the Tigers' catcher and Chapal's best friend.The one drawback to this movie is that it does feel long. It's approximately 2.5 hours but it feels more like 3 hours. There were also instances that I think some scenes were cutout. The trailers and commercials show some scenes that weren't in the movie that I thought would have been more appropriate.This is a very good movie, even if you're not a baseball fan, which being from Canada, I'm not but nonetheless I liked it. There is much more going on than baseball and the director uses some beautiful images as symbolism. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone....9/10.",8,0,0,18 September 1999
The Mummy Returns," Action packed but...
","I'm starting to see a trend in the new action/adventure movies and it may not be for the better. CGI (Computer Generated Images) is becoming one of the primary tools of many filmmakers but is it coming at a cost? We began to see CGI come into movies quite a few years ago but they were usually as enhancements to the story or to the set. Now CGI is becoming more prominent and taking a center stage role. The Mummy Returns is a very good example of this.The Mummy Returns is a sequel to the very popular The Mummy that came out in 1999. The story basically takes place several years later after our hero, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) have gotten married and have a young son (Freddie Boath). The couple are still the adventurous archeologists they were in the first movie but now they have a young son to take with them on their adventures. This story revolves around the resurrection of our arch villain, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), but with a slight twist. This time around he's to kill the Scorpion King (The Rock) that will be making a reappearance after 5000 years to take over the world. But as noble as that sounds, his motives are less than desirable.
Was I entertained? Yes, definitely BUT, this was a case of too much CGI. The blending of reality and fantasy together with CGI can be a tricky thing, especially when the two worlds meet. The audience whether consciously or not, will instinctively pick up on things when they are unable to identify with it. In this movie, we see many instances where the two worlds meet and quite a few times, my eye was attracted to something that didn't move naturally. Unlike the movie, Matrix, where we were basically told to suspend all beliefs about the law of physics and such, this movie incorporated characters that behaved human-like yet movements and detail gave them away. Mind you, I do not often see walking wolf-like creatures but their mannerism and general body shape was humanoid so the natural instinct was to identify with what you know and in too many cases, it didn't look right to the eye. The decision to generate a complete CGI of the Scorpion King at the end of the movie I thought was a big error. The looks were too cartoonish and resembled something you see on Saturday morning cartoons. It was too distracting and took away from the events at the time.However, I really enjoyed the fight sequences between the female leads (Weisz and Velazquez). They were quick and well choreographed. It's refreshing to see that directors are not afraid to show female leads as strong characters that are just as capable to fight as their male counter-parts. Fraser and Weisz played their parts well and like the last movie, Oded Fehr is outstanding. The Rock however is something else. In his movie debut, I found his performance a little bit extreme and probably not too far from his wrestling persona. Whether this will be the beginning of a film career or not, I cannot tell but hopefully his acting improves.
Overall, this was a very entertaining movie to kick off the summer. It was full of action and fast paced but I've seen much better computer graphics in other movies.",8,1,1,7 May 2001
Toy Story 2," WOW!
","Ok, ok. I know this is a cartoon and the target audience is mainly children but WOW! I can honestly say that this was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year. I was completely engaged from beginning to end and my mind never wandered once. And just in case you're wondering, when I went to see the evening showing of this movie, the audience was comprised completely of adults. There was not a single child in the theatre.For those of you who never saw the first movie (and I'm not ashamed to say that I say that one too), this movie brings back all the original characters and introduces some new ones. Walt Disney also did a very smart thing by bringing back all the original voices. In some of their other movie sequels (Pocahontas 2) they change the voices of the original characters which ended up taking away from the movie. The story line revolves around the rescue of Woody. By a strange sequence of events, Woody accidentally ends up in a garage sale and a slimy toy dealer steals him for a private collection that he tries to sell to a Japanese art dealer. Buzz and the rest of the gang witness this theft and organize a rescue mission that takes them from the safe confines of Andy's (the boy who owns all these toys) home to the big city. Along the way they meet some other interesting toys and encounter all kinds of unusual problems that they find some very creative solutions to. The ending is slightly predictable but in this case, who cares! It was a very fun movie to watch.The voice acting was absolutely excellent. All the actors were able to bring out the characters of each of the toys and create feeling and humor. And the humor!!! It was outrageously funny. The humor was obviously clean but I have never laughed so much. The computer graphics was excellent and they did somethings that made me wonder 'how did they do that?'Overall, there is not a single negative thing that I can say about this movie. It never slowed down nor were there any inconsistent plot flows or poor acting performances. Everything about it was entertaining from beginning to end. For those of you who are parents, you HAVE to take your kids to see this movie. For you adults, you HAVE to see this movie (guys, this is a great date movie). Am I making myself clear yet? GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It will definitely be worth your time and money.A",10,0,1,9 December 1999
The Hurricane," Washington holds up movie
","You know what I find amazing? Denzel Washington has been in the movie business for years and yet Hollywood never seems to give him the same respect that is given to actors like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. But when you listen to fellow actors speak about Washington, it is clear that he is regarded as an extremely talented actor and one of the best at his craft which brings me to his latest movie, The Hurricane.        This is a movie based on the true accounts of Rubin Carter, a professional boxer in the 1960s accused of murdering three people in a bar. The evidence surrounding the case was sketchy at best in the original trial yet in an attempt to satisfy public dissention and with the aid of an ethically challenged detective, a swift sentence was handed down to Carter and an innocent fan that happened to be with him when he was picked up by the police. The story paints the impression that Carter will spend the rest of his life in prison and flashes forward several years before we meet a young boy by the name of Lesra Martin. Living with a group of Canadians in Toronto, the young boy from Brooklyn visits a book market where he buys his first book; one written by Rubin Carter. A correspondence between Carter and Martin ensues not too long afterwards and after befriending the boxer, the boy and the Canadians decide that they are going to help Carter out of prison.        As with most movies based on facts, not all of it is going to be absolutely accurate. What you will see here is only one perspective and in this case, the perspective of a person wrongfully imprisoned for a crime that he did not commit. As such, you are going to see facts displayed from that perspective which may or may not be objective. Quite often, while I was sitting there, I did have questions as the story glossed over areas that did not related to the main character. For a movie that is primarily dialogue and storytelling, The Hurricane was inconsistent and sometimes incomplete. The director (Norman Jewison) would bring up situations at certain points and not really elaborate on them laterwards leaving the audience hanging on that particular issue. The impression that I got was that Jewison was trying to fit too much into the movie. He essentially tried to cover 25 years worth of facts in 3 hours and what resulted was a movie that was somewhat rushed.        What saved this movie was the performance of Washington. He took what he was given and did a fabulous job. I found myself riveted whenever he was speaking and couldn't help but gain a new respect (which I already had plenty of) for him. The young man who plays Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) also did an excellent job. The chemistry between Washington and Shannon was very evident and they do manage to tug on some heart strings. The rest of the cast was pretty good but unfortunately due to incomplete storytelling their performances seem to be lacking.        Overall, if you want to see some brilliant acting from Washington, then definitely see this movie. He has already won a Golden Globe for 'Best Male Actor' earlier this year for his portrayal of Rubin Carter and I suspect that he will be favored to win for the Oscars. Hopefully Hollywood gives him the respect that he deserves after this performance. As for pure entertainment value, this movie does manage to tell the story but you may feel a bit lacking when you leave but I still do recommend it purely from a human interest perspective.",8,0,2,21 February 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," wondrous adventure but long
","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was a much-anticipated movie and not just for children but for adults. It's a fantasy story that created a world of magic and wonder for children and for adults it brought back something that many of us have lost; our imagination. For those of you who have never read any of the books and have no idea what this movie is about (what rock have you been under?), this movie is based off the first book that J.K. Rowling wrote, `Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. The story revolves around a young boy that discovers he's a wizard. All throughout his life, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has never been able to explain strange things that happen around him in times of distress. Living with his aunt and uncle, Harry was forced to be nothing more than a servant boy. Although they knew what the cause of these happenings were, they never told Harry and did everything possible to hide his origins. He was never given any kind of attention except when something was needed of him. In fact, his bedroom was the `room under the stairs' and if something strange happened that his aunt or uncle found out about, he would get locked in his room for days or weeks. On his 11th birthday he receives a letter indicating that he's been accepted into Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Magic. Up until this point, Harry had no idea that he was a wizard or that he was the cause of these `strange' happenings. From this moment on, his life changes dramatically as he begins a wonderful journey into the discovery of his abilities and the world of magic.
Harry Potter is distinctly British and the worst thing that could have happened is for Hollywood to get a hold of it and make it through their own eyes. So when J.K. Rowling rejected the idea of Steven Spielberg directing it without having British actors (especially the lead actor), it was the first step to a successful picture. Nothing against Spielberg and I'm a huge fan of his but this movie depends greatly on the atmosphere that it creates. And part of that atmosphere was having an old British feel to it. What really worked well for this movie was that it followed the book very closely. But then again, anything that strayed from it would have caused mass criticism from children around the world. However that has never stopped directors and producers before but in this case, this was a critical factor and they were true to the book.I was quite surprised to find out that the three lead child actors are unknowns. In fact, none of them have ever acted and considering that this is their first movie, I think they did an admirable job. Radcliffe, who plays Potter, fits the physical description of Harry Potter to a `T' and his acting is not bad. The young lady who plays Hermione Granger (Emma Watson II) plays the `Miss Know-it-all' quite well although at some points she goes over the top a bit but that's something you have to expect from inexperienced actors. Rupert Grint plays Ron Weasley, the goofy, smart mouthed friend of Potter and Granger. I actually found him quite entertaining to watch. With the way the books are written and the success that this movie has had so far, we can all assume that there will be other Harry Potter movies so I'm sure we'll see these three actors again and only see better and better performances as they gain experience.
The rest of the cast is a `who's who' of actors. With seasoned actors like Robbie Coltrane, John Cleese, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, etc. it is near impossible to have poor performances. All of these actors played their parts beautifully and true to the characters developed by Rowling. It also helps that they looked like they really got into their parts and the world they were trying to create. I was especially impressed with Rickman's role as Professor Snape, the dark, brooding teacher of potions. The books description of this character is mysterious, moody and a bit slimy and Rickman pulls that off flawlessly. The one last element that really made this movie was the computer graphics. This is one movie that really required computers to create this world. Like Star Wars, this movie is in a time and place that is unfamiliar to the audience hence its ability to create reality is imperative.
There is one thing about this movie that I have to mention. It is long. At two and a half hours, this will be a long sit for children so make sure they have gone to the bathroom beforehand. The other thing is that for those adults who have read the books, the movie will feel long. Because the movie follows the book so closely, you know exactly what is going on and how much further the story has to go before the movie comes to an end. I was watching this movie with my sister and brother in-law and their reactions to it were quite different. My sister, who read the book beforehand, while still enjoying it immensely, like I found it rather long. For my brother in-law who's never read the books, found the two and a half hours flash by. So my advice is that for you adults who haven't read the book but are thinking about it, watch the movie first before you read the book or else the movie will feel really long. It won't really matter for the children if they've read the books or not; they'll be fascinated by everything they've read about come to life on the see on the screen. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was magical and wondrous and definitely suitable for children and adults. In fact the show that I went to was mostly adults. Happy wizarding!",9,0,0,25 November 2001
Enemy at the Gates," Sort of good.
","The last war movie I saw was `Saving Private Ryan' and although it was an excellent movie I wasn't sure if I wanted to see another one. For anyone who has seen a war movie, you have to admit that they can be a bit depressing, especially the more real they are. Enemy at the Gates is based on a real person, which means that a certain amount of the events are real or based on similar events. And knowing this, some of the things I saw definitely fell within the emotional category of depressing.Enemy at the Gates is based on the life of Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a young Russian soldier in the sniper division. The movie focuses on Vassili's time in the war and his rise to heroism as Russian papers detail his heroic feats as a special divisions sniper. As the war progresses and as Vassili gains notoriety, he begins to draw the attention of the German high command. To put a stop to this, the Germans send in their top sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris) to deal with Vassili. I'm not usually a stickler about movie consistencies but there were some that were quite noticeable. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie but the story was about the Germans trying to overtake Stalingrad so the characters are all either German or Russian. Hence it reasons to believe that there should be German and Russian accents. I don't really mind if the accents are off as long as the attempt was made to be somewhat authentic but instead, most of the characters either had British or American accents and when watching the movie, I had a hard time getting really into it. In addition to this, there was one point where we see Vassili writing a letter to some of his supporters, which in itself is fine but we see him being told how to spell a word by Joseph Fiennes character, Commander Danilov and he spells out the word in English. Maybe I'm getting picky but this seemed quite obvious and odd to me in the context of the scene and the overall movie. Little things like these took away from the authenticity of the movie and overall enjoyment level. On another note, some of the dialogue was a bit cliché ridden and in some situations seemed to be added for drama and Hollywood sake.The acting was quite well done, especially Ed Harris's character. The one knock I have (not against him but the direction of his character) is that the end scene with Commander Koenig and the little boy, Sasha, seemed completely out of line with the character we're given up to that point. But maybe that was the point the director was trying to make. I quite enjoyed Jude Law's performance. I haven't seen many of his films but I enjoyed this one. I really enjoyed the sniper scenes. Unlike many war movies where directors feel that it's necessary to have lots of movement and action (which is a natural part of war), I really did like the sniper scenes where there was little movement. We're still able to feel the tension that these men feel and the subtleties of being a sniper.Overall, I did like the movie but it could have been better if they paid a bit more attention to the things I mentioned above. But, like I said, maybe I'm just being picky. I'm just a guy who watches a lot of movies so what do I know.",7,1,2,15 April 2001
The Green Mile," excellent
","Should this movie get Oscar nominations? Yes. Should Tom Hanks get an Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie? Definitely. In short, this movie was very moving and makes some powerful statements about racial equality and capital punishment.Based on a novel written by Stephen King, this movie deals with the internal conflicts that a particular prison guard, Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), faces as he meets an inmate that is on deathrow that he believes is innocent. John Coffey (Michael Duncan) is the gentle giant that has been accused of killing two little girls and is scheduled to die in the electric chair. He is brought into deathrow where Hanks' character first meets him but as the movie progresses, Hanks character begins to see the true nature of this man. Coffey comes across as a gentle, caring, yet simple man and to complicate things, he poses the ability to give life which ultimately casts doubt as to the man's ability to harm another living creature. Throughout the rest of the movie you get to see the relationships that develop between this inmate and all the guards as well as with some of the other inmates. This movie does bear some resemblance to 'The Shawshank Redemption' but only slightly. The issues that are dealt with here are a little heavier in nature.This is one of the few movies that I have seen all year where the acting in it was extremely strong. There was not a single character that I found portrayed ineffectively or unrealistically. A couple of the more notable performances (aside from Hanks) came from David Morse (character of prison guard, Brutus Howell) and Michael Jeter (deathrow inmate, Eduard Delacroix). Both of these men brought a sense of feeling to their character that the audience truly felt. This was also the first film that I have seen Michael Duncan in and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, this man is HUGE. You sort of have a glimpse of his enormity in the commercials and trailers but you definitely get the full effect of it when you see him stand next to David Morse or James Cromwell. Both of these two men are about 6'6' but are dwarfed when Duncan walks into the scene with them. Aside from his 'physical' presence, this man gave a stirring performance in this movie, especially at the end in a lengthy dialogue sequence between Hanks and himself.The are a couple of things that I do have to point out. This movie is very long (3+ hours) and you definitely feel it. There are no action sequences but there is a lot of dialogue that you have to pay attention to and this attributes to the lengthiness that you feel. In addition, quite a bit of the cinematography was shot in very low light. Whether this was done on purpose to enhance authenticity or just due to poor lighting, I found it occasionally difficult to see what was going on.Overall, this movie was excellent. Be prepared to be cerebrally engaged as this movie definitely makes you think. Also, bring a box of tissues. You will definitely leave the theatre with a tear in your eye...or at the very least, a lump in your throat.",9,1,2,11 December 1999
Shrek," Whacked out and fun
","This movie has been getting rave reviews and doing phenomenal numbers at the box office for weeks now. I wasn't really sure why as the commercials for it weren't showing a whole lot. Until recently I wasn't sure I was going to see this movie but on whim, I decided to go and now I know why it's been doing so well. This movie is charming, funny and well told. Shrek (Mike Myers) is a giant green ogre that lives by himself in a swamp. He likes his privacy and is thrown into a fit of despair when all the forest's fairy tail creatures show up at his place. They're there because the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) sent them there after he banished them all from his land. Having his privacy intruded by all these creatures and by a particularly annoying fast talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), he sets off for Farquaad's castle to rectify the problem. And so begins a journey of adventure, love and self-discovery for not only Shrek but also the princess he rescues, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).I've read some other reviews and there are those that think this movie was over hyped, insensitive to short people and just not very good. I think if you look hard enough you will find almost anything to pick apart. If it's not short people, then it's big fat bald people or the abuse that a donkey takes so I'm not going to put a lot of stock in those who pick things like these out. Look at any Saturday morning cartoon and you'll probably see far worse things. It's a Hollywood movie so put your issues and beliefs aside and enjoy it for what it was, a fun summer movie. The animation was incredible. Animation technology has been advancing at lightning speeds and we saw some of it here. Toy Story 1 & 2 were incredibly well done but Shrek seemed to be a bit better in the emotions department. The character of Shrek exhibited a lot of emotions that I haven't really seen before and the donkey must have been an animator's dream to create. Talk about artistic freedom and as a result, a thoroughly entertaining character. You really do feel a sense of connection with these characters because of how well they were able to exhibit emotions. In some ways I thought that the evil Lord wasn't quite evil enough. I thought that he could have been a bit more menacing but I guess there are some restrictions considering the movie was meant for children. I loved the spoofs they did. I've seen them before in other movies like `Scary Movie' but it was kind of funny to see it in an animation. The real world and fantasy world seemed to have merged with these spoofs and it really created a sense of summer fun.To be quite honest I didn't see many things that I didn't like or thought were weaknesses and judging by the dollars it's doing, a lot of others think the same way. If you want to see a sweet, charming and very funny movie, see Shrek. And guys, this is a great date movie. She'll love it and think you're the `Shrek' of her heart.",9,0,0,12 June 2001
Any Given Sunday," I can't hear anymore.
","Hey! Heeyyyyyy, can you hear me? You can't? HOW ABOUT NOW? CAN YOU HEAR ME NOWWW?? Does it sound like I'm yelling at you?? Well if it does, then you have a basic idea of what this movie is about. It's loud, brash and not all that subtle.Any Given Sunday is a football movie...American football in case any of you were wondering. It's about a team that has an aging star quarterback, Jack Rooney (Dennis Quad) and an aging coach, Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino). The two have been together for years and the relationship is more of a father-son relationship than it is a player-coach relationship. The season hasn't been going very well and to make matters worse, Rooney gets injured early in the season and will be out indefinitely. He's in the hospital and the team turns to their backup quarterback; a not too bright guy. The team goes on a losing streak and eventually the backup gets hurt too. In goes the third string guy, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx). After a rough start, things begin to turn around as Beaman begins to change the plays and do the things that he wants. The problem is that the team is winning and Beaman has gone from a third string quarterback to a star player in the league. The team makes it to the playoffs and Rooney recovers from his injury. Now the coach has to make a decision of who to play. Does he stay loyal to Rooney or does he go with the brash, out of control but talented Beaman? The coach has very little control and management, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) is demanding results yet has an agenda of her own.If the story sounds a little convoluted to you then you're not alone. I found it hard at times to follow and very loud. There was music running almost constantly and the camera shots of the football games were very quick and 'in your face'. Be warned, if you have epilepsy, you may suffer a seizure. I know I almost did with they way they cut scenes and how loud it was. This movie was unbelievably long too. It's almost three hours long and when you think it's about to end, it drags out another 20 minutes. I do have to say though, the ending was interesting. I'm not sure if it depicts how football life really is though. I've never played so I can't comment on it.Despite those negatives, I have to say that Al Pacino was very good. But more surprisingly, I liked Cameron Diaz's performance. I saw her in 'Something About Mary' and thought she was ok at best but in this movie she was extremely good. This is the first time that I have seen Jamie Foxx and I actually liked him quite a bit. Look to him for more good things in the future. Overall, I'm luke warm to this movie. It's basically a three hour music video and may induce a brain lock. See it either as a matinee or wait until it comes out on video.",6,0,0,22 January 2000
The Matrix," Thought provoking
","I have to be honest and say that when this movie came out in the theatres, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. And a big part of it was because of Keanu Reeves. But I kept hearing how wonderful this movie was and this was at about the same time when Star Wars: The Phantom Menace came out. Now mind you, Star Wars wasn't that great either but the hype surrounding that movie promised, at the very least, an entertaining time. I recently had a conversation about movies with my sister and her boyfriend and when they found out I still hadn't seen this movie, I was soundly chastised for it and was subsequently 'summoned' to come over to their place to view it on DVD. And you know what? I'm glad they did.        The story takes place in the future where technology has taken over the world. In fact, Earth as you know it has been transformed into a technological play ground where reality and fantasy are so intertwined that it is almost impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins. We meet Neo (Keanu Reeves) at the beginning and find out quickly that this quiet young man is actually a brilliant computer hacker. He is quickly recruited by a band of secrete underground rebels who hope to free the world from the clutches of technology. It seems that computers in the future have become self-aware and have taken over the world by enslaving humans and these rebels lead by Morpheous (Laurence Fishburne) are hoping that Neo is the 'Chosen-One' to free them from this slavery.        I have to say that the special effects are wonderful. I've seen quite a few special effects intensive movies this year and The Matrix comes out very near the top. The only other one that I thought was better is Star Wars but that was to be expected when 95% of it was computer generated and George Lucas is backing it. The Matrix comes very close and in fact in some places out performs Star Wars in the creativity department.        I mentioned earlier that I stayed away from this movie because of Keanu Reeves and I'm sure many of you will agree that he is not in the same echelon as Tom Cruise or Kevin Spacey but I was pleasantly surprised here. He did do a fairly good job as Neo but part of it was the fact that he did do his own stunts and brought a sense of believability to his character. What made this movie even better was the rest of the cast, especially Laurence Fishburne. He had a lot of thought provoking dialogue in this movie and his portrayal of the rebel leader and mentor to Neo was well depicted...although it did seem somewhat similar to Yoda and Luke Skywalker. The one actor that I really did enjoy was Joe Pantoliano as Cypher. He played the laid back, yet somewhat cynical rebel very well and when he turns on his comrades his performance becomes even more enjoyable.        If you choose to see this movie, keep in mind that this movie is primarily about ideas. Focusing on plot flow will only ruin the movie's intentions. I have seen other reviews where people commented on the laws of physics or other such scientific evaluations and to be honest, this is only a movie. Its intention is to portray some idea(s), not to educated the public about energy transfer or the laws of relativity. This movie makes quite a statement about what reality is and how we perceive it so if any of you are looking to see a thought provoking movie with some pretty impressive special effects, go see this movie.

The Replacements," Entertaining
","I've seen a few football movies over the years and most of them don't really entertain me that much. The last one was `Any Given Sunday' and that one turned out to annoy me more than entertain me. `The Replacements' I liked.The story is simple. Professional football players go on strike and the team brings in replacement players to finish the season. That's it. There's no subplot or tricky twists that try to make the movie more than it's out to be. Mind you the replacement players turn out to be either misfits or just guys who never made it to the pros but then, that's the charm of the movie.The movie focuses on the characters and the situation they're placed in but it's not entirely testosterone filled (although there's quite a bit of it). There's humor laced throughout that I really enjoyed and it wasn't a two hour movie filled with swears every second word. In fact, I don't even recall hearing any now that I think about it. Keanu Reeves plays the replacement quarter back and it seems that as he gets older his acting becomes better. I still occasionally find it hard to not associate him with `Bill and Ted' but I do respect the fact that he's always gone after different roles. I've rarely seen Gene Hackman give a poor performance and he doesn't disappoint in this movie. He's done a few other `coach' type roles so this shouldn't be anything difficult. There were a couple peripheral actors that really did grab the spotlight when they had it. Rhys Ifans plays the Welsh kicker and he definitely draws a lot of laughs. I first saw him in `Nottinghill' as `Spike' and he definitely is one of the character actors that's hard not to like. Orlando Jones plays Franklin and plays him well. He's very hard to ignore when he's on screen.
Overall, I liked this movie and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good laugh but don't come to me and say that it was predictablewhat else were you expecting from a football movie?",8,0,1,12 August 2000
Tarzan," beautiful story
","The first thing that hit me as the movie started was the feeling of something grand and different. I felt this when I saw The Lion King and I liked that movie so this was a good sign.Disney stepped out on the edge here with the depiction of Tarzan and what has resulted is a fabulous movie. Unlike Disney's last Tarzan movie (The Jungle Book), this one had a more adult theme and feel to it. The story allows the audience to gain some insight and feeling into Tarzan's character and personal conflicts. It does an admirable job on some of the peripheral characters too, like Tarzan's mother and father (the gorilla parents).Most of the humor was very well done and definitely generated a laugh (the loudest laughs came from adults!). The one character that got out of hand and became annoying at points was the character that Rosie O'donnell plays (Tarzan's best friend).The animation was fabulous and it becomes doubly amazing when you realize that this was not done strictly with computers. The scenery was stunning and the audience is treated to innovative camera angles that quite literally created a thrilling ride. It wouldn't surprise me to see Disney create a ride for this at their parks.The biggest thing that I noticed was that this was the first Disney movie that did not have the characters launch into song at various points. Phil Collins does an amazing job with the music and it was incorporated into the movie at different parts to substitute for the character songs. This definately added to movie and created a more smooth flowing story.Overall, this would be a movie that I would recommend any adult to go see. Guys, this is a great date movie. For children this is a must see. 9/10.",9,2,2,19 June 1999
Gladiator," Awesome!
","Wow! That's all I can say after watching 'Gladiator'. And you know what? I'm not writing this review immediately after watching the movie like I usually do. I'm writing this review after watching the movie for the SECOND time. Yep, I saw this movie on opening night and then went and saw it again two days later.Gladiator is about a Roman General who's a hero that becomes a slave, then becomes a gladiator, and finally a hero again. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) refuses to support the young Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) as he suspects foul play after it is discovered that the current Emperor and father to Commodus is found dead. Maximus becomes an outcast and eventually a slave as he is bought by Proximo, a man who engages in the sport of gladiating by supplying the slaves that will eventually be killed in these gruesome competitions. To Proximo's surprise, Maximus not only survives competition after competition but he becomes the favorite in almost every competition. But there's more to this man's success than skill alone. There's revenge.Russell Crowe is not one of the better-known actors but he's fast becoming one. I saw him in 'Insider' and was blown away with his performance there but when I saw this movie I gained an even deeper respect for this man. He is one talented actor. The rest of the cast is no sack of potatoes either. This is probably one of the most talented group of actors assembled for one film.Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Dereck Jacobi, the list goes on and it's hard to find a weak actor in the group. I was particularly impressed with Joaquin Phoenix. I thought he played the young Emperor with a wonderful mix of child-like poutiness and scheming villany that was a good counterpart to Crowe's character. Connie Nielsen's portrayal of Commodus's sister, Lucilla, was equally well done and at times made you feel a bit uncomfortable as the hint of an incestuous relationship between her and Commodus possibly existed.The good thing about this movie was that there was a good storyline to backup the strong cast. The dialogue was appropriate to the story and unlike many of the other 'testosterone' filled movies, this one didn't suffer the fate of cheezy lines.Overall, a definite must see but I must warn you. There is a tremendous amount of graphic violence so if you're faint of heart this may not be the movie for you. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, you must go see it. For your information, the real Commodus did participate in gladiating and was rumored to have amassed a record of 1000 wins so he was no slouch in the gladiating ring.",10,0,0,16 May 2000
