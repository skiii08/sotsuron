Sucker Punch," When Imagination stops imagining..
","Girls from Anime, now in live action, fighting monsters and bad guys? OK, I get the 'attractiveness' of this concept, but such a pointless plot and bad execution? From some really bad casting choices, like completely unbelievable villain, to a failure to create a story which makes sense..! Both worlds, the reality and the fantasy lack consistency and originality. Also creators tried so hard to stay within PG13 ratings, that the result is a film which is pointless and naive to a mature viewer and way too suggestive and confusing to a youth. The film leaves an impression of an eclectic piece edited out of some visually stylish dark French movie and pointless CG action sequences from a computer game.",2,29,61,27 March 2011
