Blade Runner 2049," King of sequel
","Blade Runner 2049 is a great movie that recovers the greatness of the original 1982 film, which surpasses the test of time, the director Denis Villeneuve did an insuperable job rivaling the first film without doubt did his homework by recreating and rescuing the Cyberpunk style to perfection giving details so faithful to what represents this future and the way to tell the story formidable, Roger Deakins is shown in photography giving a truly beautiful color and texture, in performances Ryan Gosling is shown leaving a performance of what better than done in a while ago, Harrison Ford I think that is due to duty, is not because it acts bad only felt his appearance of moments, Ana de armas and Jared Leto I liked their characters, possibly missing more Leto, but his excellent work, Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer bring us a beautiful music that envelops in every moment that passes, the only thing that could say that the film fails a is the exaggeratedly long it is, I do not think it was that it was necessary that some scenes, if you remove the plot of the film is not affected and that moment could be very tedious, other than that the rest is excellent I think Philp K Dick would be proud of this.",10,3,13,8 October 2017
It," all float with emotion
","a really entertaining film, with a great cast, excellent photography, good chemistry between characters, but enough entertaining not to notice the only failure to consider (CGI), the great balance between adaptation and fidelity to the work of Stephen king is something of respect, suspense, fun and gore had never looked so good, until today recommended only to people who do not seek terror, just some adventure with suspense.",9,2,4,19 September 2017
A Star Is Born," A Star Director is Born
","There are stories that over time have been told and rewritten for different periods, one of these stories is 'a star is born' a film that is re-adapted 4 times and that in turn is inspired by a George Cukor movie 1932 called 'What Price Hollywood?' You could even say the movie The artist film of 2011 has a lot of this plot, the first of a young talent ascend, while a veteran talent falls into decadence is not very new, but if you have talent to direct, write, act and sing Something good comes out of that, and this is where Bradley Cooper comes in. He makes his debut as a director and does it in an exceptional way. Without doubt, he knows what he wants to do, he knows how to add essence to every scene that he acts and generates with Lady Gaga. his performance is also brilliant, Sam Elliott also acts and the little or much of his scenes steal every minute of the film, the picture of Matthew Libatiquees superb and not to mention the soundtrack of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper is impressive and to applaud a combination Between Country, Pop and Rock, which is really the highlight of the film, the melodrama is quite fluid but if perhaps it is a bit slow, Bradley Cooper goes so far into the world of his adaptation that forgets to prioritize some things, in conclusion is a captivating film, impressive and quite entertaining, a film shows us a promising talent as a director who takes the palms throughout the film, no doubt if you enjoy the good music of the Country , pop and rock and the dramas with good plot is definitely a movie that you can not miss.",9,1,2,17 October 2018
Aquaman," Aquaman good movie, the fans will finally be able to sleep peacefully
","Dc comics has had a few and unfortunate setbacks when trying to make movies, but this is not one of those stumbles the movie, Aquaman gives us a story based on one of the best comics of the character Throne of Atlantis and in this adaptation gives us a pretty solid story full of emotion that immerses us in a world not seen the film is an amalgam of perfectly well combined genres of moments is an action movie, others is adventure, science fiction and even romantic and horror, director James Wan undoubtedly knows very well how to get into the plot of a film, contains a message of environmental awareness quite good, but that could see was still better exploited even so James Wan perfectly well leads the actors under his charge Jason Momoa we It gives a stunning and totally incredible Aquaman that makes the jokes towards the character disappear,Amber Heard is wonderful as Mera who proves not to be a damsel in danger and rather a rough heroine, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II gives us a rather intimidating Black Manta and Patrick Wilson gives us an imposing Ocean Master, also acts Willem Dafoe , Dolph Lundgreen and Nicole Kidman who do it quite well, on the other hand the CGI effects are mostly impressive, except for some moments that are too noticeable, but the scenes in combat are sublime and the handling of the camera in those scenes is spectacular , the music of Rupert Gregson-Williams is quite good and according to the scenes that keeps you entertained, in Conclusion Aquaman is the best movie in the universe of Dc? Well definitely, it has bad things in it I do not deny it, but in my opinion details that can be done aside, if something makes clear is that when Warner allows his directors to work on their stories something good comes out of it, to my personal taste Aquaman seemed infinitely superior to that seen in Wonder woman, which is highly recommended not to lose it",9,3,6,13 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2 great!
","When it premieres a second installment has an expectation of only one and is better than the first (which is difficult) and despite the fact that this was definitely not over its first and the reason is simple David Leitch, (better known for films like: Atomic and John Wick) I do not take a risk with something new is just what he did entertaining in the first but multiplied by 2, double brutality, double humor, double references (the captain america likes this) and clear much more deadpool Ryan Reynolds found his perfect personification for superhero or better said antihero, who won my love and is my favorite character in this movie is Domino (Zazie Beetz) is certainly a great character, the one that I put the movie is the villain Cable played by Josh Brolin who undoubtedly in avengers infinity war doing thanos showed us an excellent villain but here in deadpool is a very simple villain to be the villain of a character who breaks the fourth wall is a very one-dimensional villain and the weak link in the film, but despite having many things without meaning that is the idea, it is a parody of the parody is logical that these irrelevancies exist and is the reason to love this movie",8,2,3,21 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor God of Comedy?
","Thor Ragnarok the best Thor movie? Many of the opinions speak about how clever it was to change the tone of the film and that it gave it originality and this would be true if it had not been for the Guardians of the galaxy since 2014 that it premiered and revolutionized this idea and since then they have come a series of movies with mechanics 80% comedy 20% plot and works as a movie just for fun, but perhaps it is for the only thing that should be ?, the Ragnarok in mythology is the apocalypse Nordic and here they took it as a joke, of course that this is reflected in its director Taika Waititi,Chris Hemsworth as Thor is good work, but he was severely affected by the change of tone his personality is totally different to what wines in previous movies , Tom Hiddleston as Loki I think of the few rescuers in the MCU, nothing bad to say about him, Cate Blanchett as Hela, simply fantastic, his captive role, good scenes of action, good us effects, the music is the only one that begins to tire that put retro music instead of a very good soundtrack? ,, so to conclude Thor Ragnarok is the best of Thor? and the answer is yes, it is entertaining, it fulfills its objective (to make money and space until it arrives avengers) but more important to entertain, it is not memorable, there is not something that tomorrow will remember and say wow that epic was that, only one more than the long list of superhero movies.",7,0,4,5 November 2017
Ready Player One," Ready for a nostalgic movie
","Based on the book by Ernest Cline of the same name in the film, this incredible adventure of an incredible director who shows the respect to catch us in his films Steven Spielberg has enchanted generations with his stories, caught a generation with jaws, a generation with jurasic park, because at this time I play this movie that you will probably remember for posterity and know how to catch you calling Alan Silvestri in charge of music makes something exceptional by putting a score to the retro that makes you remember your work in the movies return to the future and in turn the director of photography Janusz Kaminski who has worked with Spielberg for some time, shows why Spielberg still trusting him, his performances are great but nothing that comes out on that side, all the greatness of the film, all the incredible that is falls on easter eggs (easter eggs) is a visual pleasure to marvel at a whole world full of references so many references that capitan america would be dead, the only bad thing I could say about the film is that it tries to be linear, the bad is very bad, the good ones are very good, it is a very worn cliche but what you see catches you and does not there is a detail that you do not want to lose sight of, there is not just a moment you want to turn around and watch the clock and want it to end, just sit there for 2 hours and enjoy your childhood and your present and experience it in a movie.",10,0,2,31 March 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody : for the fans, not for the critics apparently.
","Queen is undoubtedly one of the best rock band in history and to comment on a movie about her fame is something really complicated. The critics have been divided, half loves her and the other half hates her and I understand both sides, the movie If it has a lot of potential but if it is poorly developed, the film may fail, even though the film is credited to Bryan Singer. His departure is clearly noticeable, although his departure was a few weeks after finishing the filming. being edited maybe it affects the final production, it has great problems of chronology and that tend to lose meaning in some things, although on the other hand to lighten the issues of Mercury's personal life to see them softer than they were. quite, despite its failures, however as a fan I love every second of the movie despite its mistakes that for a radical fan can be unforgivable in the end you ignore them, because you come to see Queen and you have them, each one of the actors and their interpretations are exalted, Rami Malek is Freddie Mercury of that you have no doubt, his expressions, his movements, the voice when speaking, also Marc Martel does a very good job in equalizing his voice to the sing and that's to applaud, Ben Hardy is Roger Taylor, Joseph Mazzello is John Deacon and Gwilym Lee is undoubtedly Bryan May, Lucy Boynton also does an amazing job being Mary Austin, it shows that in the music work they are sitting very Bryan May and Roger Taylor because certainly something that knows this biographical film is make you want to sing especially in the best concert of all time Live Aid of 1985 makes you go into the scene, in conclusion Bohemian Rhapsody is perhaps not the great biographical film that everyone wanted but if a love letter for all the fans of Queen, if you're looking morbidly see the stories told about your personal life better not bother to see it that you will not find here, what has the formation the band and the motivations that kept them as a family and not just as a band.",9,3,4,3 November 2018
Justice League," This is the True Dawn of the Justice
","Justice League after the mixed opinions of the people by Batman v Superman and after Wonder woman was a success he had his doubts about a film where a team was formed without making individual films first, and I do not know if it is the fan inside ò the boy who lived with episodes and episodes of such a great animated series, but I just can not hate this movie, love every moment I saw, but with respect to this ensemble, the film is an amalgam between two creative minds, one visual and the other arguments, and it is noticeable when one began and the other ends, it is noticeable when the film falters and it is in the CGI, the visual effects are good at the moment, then as they fail and this is noticeable in his villain steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) because of moments see well other moments like no, Cyborg (Ray Fisher) also suddenly notice the very simple effects, regarding the plot is simpler and easier to digest something that many discussed from earlier I think it goes more in a straight line and that can help you not feel boring, on the contrary it is very entertaining and fun and having humor is not synonymous with bad jokes or comedy every five minutes, there is a balance in this however there are some holes that leave you in doubt if that was still missing or explain something and this is due to two factors the first is Warner not wanting to risk making a movie that lasts more than two hours and the second is that the change of director did not help at all with the final edition, even with these flaws there is something that makes one of those mistakes forget and is what we come to see the league of justice, the chemistry between the actors is amazing it is seen as a fairly united family that get along well you want and want to see more of them in action everyone makes their excellent role Ben affleck is Batman, Gal Gadot is still the amazing Wonder Woman, Ezra miller is an excellent Flash you just can not not love him, Jason Momoa takes over a rude Aquaman and dive As you feel like watching your individual movie, Ray Fisher as Cyborg maybe the weakest link but still the plot works for him and Henry Cavill as Superman is the hero that everyone expected him to be is the boy- scout that fans asked for, the band sound of Danny Elfman is very much in line with the situations, nothing memorable (except for his batman theme and the classic theme of superman) but still very present in the scenes, without a doubt this movie I loved, I would see the times they were because it has the essence of heroism that was needed that fun and charm that had the animated series, the animated movies, an era of heroes is coming and this was the prologue of better moments.",9,3,9,17 November 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity Wow
","10 years ago since there is the marvel cinematographic universe and 6 years ago we saw for the first time this great team of heroes who fight the battles that ordinary humans can not fight and today they achieved it with all the palmas, the movie directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, it is spectacular, a visual and innovative delight that surely many generations will one day see with affection, there is not a single minute that you are not stuck to the screen looking at everything, something that spielberg made us do recently with ready player one, and that is really a very good movie that has drama, action, comedy but its balance makes it sensational and everything I could say about history, about characters, about who is the best actor serious spoiler and it is something that as an spectator you would not be able to do, but in spite of these compliments if you have your problems, maybe, without a doubt it is something that you can not miss and that you will enjoy a lot, it is very enida, very enjoyable but it is not epic ... but it was close",9,1,3,27 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars maybe without the force that accompanies it.
","Star Wars The Last Jedi is one of those movies that you wait with animosity that is epic and ends up leaving you with that emptiness that I miss something that never came, the film has a luxury casting, Daisy Ridley as King, her performance is incredible, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren at the end of the characters has a clear definition of what he wants to do with him, Oscar Isaac as Poe and John Boyega as Finn is better noted his place as characters in this film, Mark Hamill is certainly a great actor and sad that they want to pigeonhole it on just this character, as Luke presents a rather interesting side of the Jedi side and Carrie Fisher (peacefully rest) does an excellent role, all this great cast and still does not have a plot solid enough to be epic and this leads to a problem, the same problem that is noted in thor ragnarok, going from a moment that was epic, to one that they want to be fun and I do not think it's a problem of the director Rian Johnson who in looper showed that ue has talent to tell a story with incredible details and is present in every visual detail of the film you can tell that he knows this world of star wars, has sequences that keep you entertained, the soundtrack where John Williams is self-homage is incredible, but no more that, there is no that makes star wars love us so much, it is a film for fun and the option to see the weekend and the following week, it is not totally bad, but if you are a fan of star wars maybe you leave somewhat disillusioned, in conclusion the film sins of trying to be like the empire strikes back and ends up being like the return of the jedi",8,0,0,18 December 2017
The Shape of Water," the shape of a good movie
","Guillermo del Toro shows why many consider him an excellent director, the film is wonderful as a dark reinvention of the story of the beauty and the beast gives it its touch of originality, it makes an inter-species relationship that feels attachment so real and beautiful his characters and this is thanks to the excellent performance of Sally Hawkins and his chemistry with Doug Jones show that acting goes beyond immense dialogues and that emotions through our expressions and sign language do not limit us to understand the feeling that surrounds us each scene, also the actors like Michael Shannon who plays an excellent role, Octavia Spencer who recently did an Gifted and shows how talented he is and Richard Jenkins also does a great job, the music of Alexandre Desplat using classical music to set the mood according to the moments that are happening throughout the film and the photograph of Dan Laustsen just beautiful who had already I worked with del Toro on Crimson Peak and mimic , but despite the fact that I loved the movie there is only one but I could put it and it is the manipulator that is with the protagonists and I mean is that each of the characters are forced too to love them or to feel sympathy for them or even to feel hatred for them, it is as if they were marked with a sign saying that he is good, he is bad, he is innocent that comes to feel forced at the time of seeing this film, outside of that the film is incredible both visual, and narrative (except for that detail) is definitely a melodrama with fantasy that you must see.",9,33,63,14 January 2018
Wonder Woman," Movie wonder
","Made a wonderful story that traps you from beginning to end with great elements faithful to comics from the classic until new 52, of the best castings of characters that attract you, with their personality and good chemistry between them and a story that respects the mythology of the characters as cool as possible, without doubt the best film of superheroes of the year.",10,11,28,2 June 2017
Black Panther," Black panther protector of a good movie
","Black panther is the demonstration that if Marvel wants to deliver frames without so much humor it can do it, undoubtedly one of the best movies of super heroes, by not trying to be a film of origin and not being the prelude to Infinity war that is, he found a perfect balance as an individual film and connected to his cinematographic universe his director Ryan Coogler is noted that he knows how to make great stories and that let him tell it his way is to applaud, the cast is great from Chadwick Boseman as the black panther, Michael B Jordan as a truly intimidating antagonist, Lupita Nyong'o great actress, even the little or much that Andy Serkis plays is appreciated, the score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson is impressive since it is rare to see that they dedicate more to the soundtrack than songs that is to admire and applaud (I appreciate that it was not pure rap, not because I do not like it but it is a very common cliche) and the picture of Rachel Morrison is truly spectacular, the only thing I could say that it is the CGI that there are certain sequences that are not as solid as the plot base, in conclusion it is a solid and entertaining film that shows that well-balanced humor with action and an interesting plot can make a big difference, this movie feels like 2 tapes, on the one hand the heroic and full of action and on the other hand the serious and political issues within your world",9,4,19,19 February 2018
Incredibles 2," the incredible sequel
","14 years have passed since Pixar and Brad Bird brought the first part of this film and if one thing Brad Bird knows is making a good movie and it is understood why it took so many years to connect with the sequel had to bring not only a movie with animated advances, I also had to have a plot with a sense and emotion that we feel in The Incredibles, Ratatouille and The Iron Giant, The Incredibles 2 is not just about being an animated superhero movie, it is about generating awareness under parental responsibilities,, it's about balanced feminine empowerment and it's about generating awareness about the obsession we have with technology, all accompanied by an excellent music of Michael Giacchino that reminds you of the espionage music of the 60's-70's, It has small visual details that bothered me but not enough so that I do not continue to love her, in conclusion an extremely funny movie, with great action stories and great history that despite making animated manages more real problems than other superheroes this year and is something that you definitely can not miss.",9,1,5,17 June 2018
