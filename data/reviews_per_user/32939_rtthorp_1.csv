The Monuments Men," That's Undertainment
","The real life story and the premise for the film is fascinating and worthy of being told if you consider that art represents one of humanities highest achievements and it is worth dying for. It is ironic, therefore, that the telling of this heroic story in film falls so far short as a piece of art itself. Film is one of North America's greatest artistic endeavours and achievements but here it resides at the ridiculous end of the spectrum. The script, cinematography, soundtrack, acting, continuity and editing are thoroughly uninspired, clunky, hackneyed and badly done. No tension, no jeopardy. The tone and feel also jar - WW2 looks clean, colourful, dry, warm, washed, pressed, cosy and well fed - a weekend re- enactors nostalgic dream and not the dirty, wet, endlessly fatiguing, brutal, constantly life threatening, hungry, total war it was.",3,2,3,1 March 2014
