Skyfall," Not sure at all.
","Well I've got tickets for tomorrow to see it at the Odeon Marble Arch with the wife & a friend, but like the big kid I am I couldn't wait and saw it this afternoon at my local Vue in North Finchley.Not sure if I love this film or hate it. It's unlike any other Bond film before it, I guess that's my problem. The plot I thought was a bit hmmm and the pacing I thought was very slow in the middle section, I kept wishing they would ramp up the action rather than all the farting around! Should Bond be a broody almost art film experience with lots of pondering introspection/emotion, or a no brainer series of action scenes interlinked by a dodgy story involving a megalomaniac trying to take over or destroy the world, interspersed with lots of cool gadgets and good looking girls eagerly jumping into bed with our hero quicker than it takes him to drink his shaken not stirred Martini.I really need to see it again (tomorrow) to finally decide if it's a work of genius or an over-hyped attempt in making a Bond for the 21st century that is so far removed from the previous films that they have destroyed it. The acting, photography is excellent though, but I didn't like the Thomas Newman score. Newman's scores all remind me of his American Beauty work using lots of pseudo ethnic percussion that I feel is not at all right in a Bond film. I think the next one will be more of your classic James Bond fare which is better I think than continuing on in this style........I think?One thing I am sure about is that it's nowhere as good as the greatest most gritty Bond film of all time............. Casino Royale. Where Bond kicks the **** out of everyone and doesn't stand around pondering his childhood.",5,10,23,27 October 2012
Argo," Solidly entertaining but another example of US historical revisionism
","Let me start by saying as a piece of entertainment Argo is very good. Good acting, good editing, great music and solid direction by Ben Affleck and some great casting (The actors are almost splitting images of the real people concerned, see the films end credits) The attention to visual detail is superb. The reason I'm only giving this film a 4 star rating is the historical inaccuracies. The film only as a postscript acknowledges the Canadian input into the hostage rescue, and this was only added to the film after a test screening. OK the final tense scenes at the airport never happened in real life and that is excusable as it adds nail biting tension to the drama but to depict the rescue as solely a CIA endeavor is inexcusable. This is American cinema at its most disrespectful and nearly as bad as the historical re-write in the film U571 where the Americans claimed to have captured the German Enigma machine whereas in reality the British captured it. Entertainment is an important release in these troubled times but keeping historical accuracy in films is more important IMO. The real story is a triumph over multi national cooperation and has enough meat to make a great film, so why alter the facts? Argo is a good entertaining story but could have been a classic film without the stars & stripes BS.",4,5,6,11 October 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Who are these people saying its poor?
","Great Star Wars film. Full of action, great set pieces, humour & emotion. Yes it's a bit making it up after TLJ but I don't care. I think JJ has pulled the rabbit out of the hat and produced a Star Wars movie that most hardened cynics couldn't help but like. I agree with Mark Kermode on Radio One when he said that the scenes featuring Carrie Fisher look like they were written to fit what footage they had and yes seeing her in those scenes does seem a little odd as it doesn't quite fit but it works imo. We had to have Leigh in this film and it was far more fitting & decent to have not gone down the Rogue One process of replicating her. I love this film but I need to see it again (and again and again) to see whether the emotion has clouded my judgement. In saying that, now after just seeing it for the first time, I think it's the best Star Wars film after IV & V. Wonderful. 9/10.",9,2,12,21 December 2019
