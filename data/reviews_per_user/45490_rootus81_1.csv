Black Swan," Fairly Intense
","Having only recently watched Requiem for a Dream and reading all the reviews about how disturbing this film is I've got to say I found it pretty mild on that front. Having said that it takes nothing away from the quality of this movie, great story line well acted even the parts about the ballet and dancing that does not interest me in the slightest was made interesting to watch. The bad points are the horror/suspense bits could have been better, they never really had me scared or even a little edgy but perhaps that wasn't Aronofsky's intention. Overall this is one of the better films I've seen this year and well worth a watch 8/10",8,0,1,3 March 2011
