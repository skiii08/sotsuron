Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Special Effects don't make a movie
","In terms of box office taking this movie is forth or fifth. In terms of special effects this is a top film but in terms of story and loyalty to the original trilogy this is abysmal.Darth Vader is the ultimate movie villain, forget Freddy Kruger and Voldermort, but a cute little kid was used to play the role of him as a boy. Genius? I think not.Another thing, Darth Maul is a fantastic character. I think it's fair to say that everyone loves Darth Maul. Why the hell was he only on screen for about 10 minutes? Darth Maul was the key to success in making a passable Star Wars prequel.The question is, If Darth Maul wasn't on the screen for a decent amount of time then who was? Three words- Jar Jar Binks. The perfect character if you're under ten years old, an insult to the greatest sci-fi films of all time if you're over ten.",4,3,5,20 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best film of all time
","In 1977 the entertainment industry was not quite up to the 21st century standards. The special effects in Star wars are not fantastic but they would have been in their time. Still, Star Wars is the best film ever made, it was released in a time where people were using special effects for disaster movies and no one thought it would do that well but it took the UK and America by storm and it became he 4th most attended movie ever (but the 3 above it: Snow White, Sound of music and Gone with the wind have all been re-released so it's pretty unfair) and the 2nd highest ever grossing film (Behind Titanic which was released over 20 years later when ticket prices were over double the price). The nobodies who played the parts became huge actors of the time, Harrison Ford is hailed as the most successful actor of all time. The rest of the trilogy was also very good, Empire strikes back is also one of the best films ever (dunno what happened in the Phantom Menace though, whose idea was Jar Jar Binks?) All in all i think it's a pretty good film.",8,4,7,17 March 2005
