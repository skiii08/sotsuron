Hereditary," True Disappointment!
","The first half hour is so boring. Yet I hung in there, because based on what I had read in reviews, this was one 'scary movie'. There is absolutely nothing scary about this movie. Next, no investment in the characters. Could care less what happened to them. The acting was ridiculous at times and I felt embarrassed for Toni Collete. Happy to see the end because then I could turn the damn thing off. Top 5 of the worst movies I've seen this year. Glad I only spent $1.79 to rent at Redbox. Also, a movie classified as 'horror', should be that. This movie was terrible and I will not recommend it to anyone.",1,1,5,4 September 2018
