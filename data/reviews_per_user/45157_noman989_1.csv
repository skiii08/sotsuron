Ghost," An all-round interesting movie, but a bit too long!
","I just watched this movie this morning, though it's bit old, but it's the first time I watched it. As the name says Ghost, its not more of a horror-flick, but a movie that has everything in it, yes the drama, thrill, crime, comedy, romance, scifi!! It's for every other movie fan, but unfortunately there's no horror in it! Yes but there's a ghost(Sam), he is murdered by a man, while being with his girlfriend outside some theater, however that girl ( Demi) thinks that he was somewhat accidentally killed, but actually he was murdered by their trusted good pal named Carl in this movie. Sam stays in this world as a ghost and he has to tell his girl that he was killed and the killer is gonna kill her too! There's much more then that, little bit of comedy shared with the spiritual contractor lady, some sci-fi and some interesting thoughts put into this movie. There are some touchy scenes, they might make you feel the movie! In the end, a must watch , I'm not going to tell you all, so you can watch this. Overall, i'd give this movie 7.5/10! The best actor for this movie has to be Sam.",8,2,5,7 July 2005
