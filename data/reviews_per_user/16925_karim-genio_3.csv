The Avengers," Good movie but Way overrated !!!!!
","I saw this movie 1 hour ago....on bluray; Quality of the disc is superb....but the movie is not that GOOD....it's a little too long i think...and is surely intented for TEENS & KIDS mostly!!! Yes that is right: unlike batman, HULK 1 & 2 , spiderman 3....this is for teen/young adultsthis movie is not serious at ALL....but it's still a good watch....i did prefer this better than transformers 2 however....but for example Xmen trilogy and last stand were way better....The last 45mn of the movie are quite nice and explosive; all in all a decent, but spectacular movie!",6,2,7,7 September 2012
Moana," Superb from start to finish !
","I watched this long after release in bluray:<ul><li>PQ is just jaw dropping and sound is great (albeit in my system not fantastic...), story is very interesting and animation and AMAZING; this is one of the best animation i have ever seen, and believe me i have watche A LOT !</li></ul>This is not a masterpiece, but is is fantastic and not just for kids...i recommend it even more for adults !",9,0,2,13 May 2018
The Bourne Legacy," good lead actor....that's it !
","Bourne is regarded as a very good trilogy. Honestly i never really was a fan of the first 3 films. They were enjoyable enough....maybe a 6.5/10 as far as i am concerned ! Anyway after seeing the trailers for the 2012 version i said...'hey this looks nice, but will it even be as good as the last ones' ? after the first 30mn i understood that the BOURNE name was soiled...this movie was bad....yes BAD. what is this hype i read online ??? Story is poor, action is not interesting...and the soundtrack is not memorable ! Believe me this should have been a direct to Bluray movie at best...the only thing that saves this crap is the good lead actor and a few action moments that are nice. If you have not seen it, skip it, you are NOT missing a damn thing !",5,5,9,10 May 2013
