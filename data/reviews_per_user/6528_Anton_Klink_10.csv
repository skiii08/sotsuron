Alien 3," A first glimpse of Fincher's genius, this movie gets better with each viewing
","The first time I saw Alien 3, I was disappointed. The second time I saw it, I was strangely fascinated. The third time I saw it, I absolutely adored it - and it gets better with each viewing! I didn't know about Fincher then, but a few movies later (The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room) I now know what it was - a first glimpse of a coming genius. If you've liked any of Fincher's later movies, you might want to check this one out - disappointment, fascination, terror and beauty all in one! Not bad for a big-screen debut, not bad at all.",8,1,3,21 September 2002
Citizen Kane," Did Orson Welles travel back in time to make a movie about the post-truth era and its greatest champion?
","The protagonist Charles Kane is a brash and jovial woman-grabbing, wife-cheating, promise-breaking, populist-talking, election fraud claiming, gilded and opulent billionaire of inherited fortunes, who is a 'champion of the people' and who's favourite pastime is to manufacture and spread fake news. When campaigning to become governor, he even makes a promise in a speech at a rally to appoint a special district attorney to investigate, prosecute and convict his political opponent. Not to mention that he has a fabulous retreat in Florida by the name of Mara... I mean Xanadu. Does any of that sound familiar? I cannot believe I am watching a movie from 1941. Ever since the movie's release, people have been talking, how much ahead of its time 'Citizen Kane' was. Boy, if they only knew.Apart from the uncanny coincidences with modern times, the virtues of the movie itself are numerous. The script is witty and the mystery keeps us guessing. The direction, cinematography and camera angles look modern even today and must have been ground-breaking back in the day. Jumping back and forth in time keeps the viewer on his toes, which also brings us to the age transformations displayed in the movie, as those are simply marvelous. Especially believable is Orson Welles himself, either as an energetic young man, a more reserved middle aged one or a visibly aged old one. This must be the first movie, where I don't get the jarring feeling of seeing a young man play the part of an old man or vice versa (although the same can't quite be said of the actresses, who must have resisted being made up to look old). Having pulled together all the different parts needed to make a movie work, you really feel like you are seeing the work of a genius here. No wonder this movie is considered one of the towering masterpieces of cinema. If my hunch is correct and a certain political figure has taken away and implemented all the wrong messages from this movie, it is still having a very real effect on everyone's lives today. How many movies from the 1940s (or even at all, up to the most recent ones) can claim that? A unexpectedly tremendous achievement indeed.",7,2,6,22 February 2017
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," From potential disaster to one of the BEST action movies ever!
","This could easily have been a disaster. With James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, Brad Fiedel (composer) nowhere in sight for this movie and Arnie's career in the gutter for the past ten years, the whole project had a feel of 'let's try to save Arnie's career one last time' and 'let's try to make a quick buck off the Terminator franchise'.I had serious doubts the 56-year old Arnold could still command the screen like he used to. And I had grave doubts about the idea of a female villain - with T-1000 from T2 being one of the ultimate movie villains of all time in my opinion, throwing in a woman seemed like something the movie-makers were trying to do just to be 'different'. Plus her being robotic again seemed like a step down from T2's polymorphic terminator. Nick Stahl didn't seem like an appealing choice for John Connor either. And the idea of Claire Danes seemed like an artificial drag-along in order for our hero to 'have a girlfriend'.The only sign of hope was the big budget. With an accepted budget of $170-$200 million, they HAD to make a movie which can rely on more than just the opening weekend box office. And I was relieved to find out that they DID!Of course I realize that with such low expectations, it would have been easy for the movie to exceed them. But that is hardly the case here - T3 is not only the action movie of the year, it is without a doubt one of the BEST action movies of all time. I was happy to see Arnie back on top - even if it is for just this one movie. I was happy to see the female terminator was actually a step up from T-1000. I was happy to see Nick Stahl being just PERFECT for the role. The eerie atmosphere of T1 was back and the action (especially the fighting and car-chase sequences) absolutely DECIMATED Matrix Reloaded even without having to rely on either CGI slow-motion, bullet-time photography or dangling from wires. The movie was even able to handle the usual stumbling-place of all action movies - the ending - surprisingly well.As far as action movies go - 10 out of 10.",8,0,0,12 July 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Shot to the top of my list of awesome movie experiences immediately!
","As for my movie preferences background (so you'd get a picture of my taste), here's a sampling of my most recent awesome movie experiences (inducing shivers, tears and being dazed for a long time after the movie) - Fight Club, Cast Away, Matrix, Cruel Intentions, Three to Tango, Unbreakable. And these are older movies I can never get enough of - Die Hard (original), Much Ado About Nothing (Shakespeare), Robocop, Terminator 2. As you can see - heavy action and paper-towel romance.Then came along a movie that blended action like we've never seen it before (think Jet Li/Bruce Lee on steroids) and romance like we seldom see it (think Shakespeare & Jane Austen co-authoring) - and I WAS COMPLETELY MESMERIZED. The calmness of daily interactions (& secret romance) and the fury of the fight sequences were an absolutely breath-taking contrast. The excellence of the main cast, the scenery, the plot, the dialogue, the choreography, everything about this movie kept me on the verge of tears for the sheer beauty of it all almost 2 hours straight. Thank you Ang Lee (director) and Yen Woo-ping (fight choreographer) - 10 out of 10, no questions asked.If you don't like action and romance, you'll be bored. If you like only one of the two, you'll be half-bored. But for any fan of both breathtaking action/fight sequences and deep touching passionate romance - this could really revitalize your belief in the existence of good movie-making.",10,0,0,8 June 2001
Life Is Beautiful," Probably the most undeserving movie on the IMDb top 250 list
","Bad acting with constant intolerable clowning by the lead actor, a sappy script with plot holes you could drive a tank through, a farcical comedy about... getting killed in a Nazi concentration camp? What the...? How was this nominated for an Oscar, let alone was able to win one? And how is it the 26th highest rated movie of all time on IMDb? One of the worst movies I have seen in a long long time.",4,6,16,24 February 2017
A Clockwork Orange," A horribly over-rated, over-acted farce
","I can't believe this film. I would have dismissed it immediately if it wasn't for its so-called 'reputation'.I could stomach the violence, the 'symbolism' and even all the weirdness, but I could not stomach the absolutely TERRIBLE overacting in this movie. For some reason Kubrick made all the actors perform as if they were in a high-school play or in some 70s sitcom. I kept thinking 'Monty Python' and waiting for the punch-line, which, of course, never came.A lot of comments here say that you'd need to view this film more than once to start to appreciate it. I say even one viewing is one too many - this farce is simply not worth your time.",3,4,8,23 August 2001
Casino Royale," Oh... my... god... Thank you for this new and reinvented Bond!
","If you've seen any, better yet, all of the Bond movies, then you know what to expect when you go to see another installment of the franchise - the wise-cracking one-liners, the always perfect hair, the gadgets that border on the ridiculous, larger than life villains and their evil world domination plans, disposable bond-girls, 'shaken, not stirred' and of course, the spectacular finish, where everything explodes and collapses.Yeah. Go expect that. And be blown away. For I certainly was. Honestly, this is not just the best Bond movie I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen them all), this in my opinion is one of the best action movies I've ever seen period. And a very, very welcomed reinvention of the whole saga.So what's different? For starters now we have a short and blonde Bond, since that is what Daniel Craig certainly is. An abomination you say? That's what I thought as well, until I saw the movie that is. In light of Craig's performance though it becomes apparent that Bond doesn't need to be tall, dark and 'handsome' at all. Craig takes the caricature of what Bond had become and gives it a completely new, revitalized substance.I do remember when Pierce Brosnan used to talk about making Bond more human. Unfortunately he never got around to it (though no doubt a decision of the producers rather than his). The Bond of Craig however is as human as he is tough (and believe me, he is plenty tough). Unlike previous Bonds, who mostly only cruised through even the most dangerous of situations without breaking much of a sweat, Craig sweats, bleeds and hesitates like anyone would. Yet he is still heads and tails above all the pretty-boy Bonds of the past or as the character played by Eva Green so aptly put it: 'Even if all that's left of you is your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met'.Which brings us to the female lead of Eva Green, who is anything but another disposable bond-girl. Smart, witty, tough yet frail and in my opinion the one of the most beautiful beautiful girls ever featured in a Bond movie, both her presence and her dialogues with Bond are some of the highlights of the movie.The story will keep you guessing and assumes you actually have a few functional brain-cells, the main villain is wonderfully sinister but not over the top where he become laughable, the suspense is played out perfectly and the action is exactly what you'd expect from a true Bond movie and not another 'action comedy'.In conclusion, whereas previous Bond movies were increasingly becoming forgettable 'action' comedies, which kept moving through the compulsory scenes of the comic-relief Q and his gadgets, the cardboard Bond and his impeccable hair, the bumbling Moneypenny and her futile flirting, the improbable final action with explosions and collapsing (well actually you still get that, but it's not what you expect) and all the other clichés we've seen to the point of total boredom, this new Bond is a raw, gritty and tough action movie with a perfect blend of suspense and yes, human emotions, added to the mix. It is a human Bond - and as such, a very welcome one.So all I can do is thank the producers, writers, director and cast for this completely reinvented Bond - a very welcomed update for the 21st century of this great franchise.",10,2,4,11 April 2007
Signs," A perfect alien invasion movie - and a complete opposite of Independence Day (thankfully!)
","Some say director M. Night is trying to hammer in a message of some sort with this movie and it will sit with those generally in favour of the idea and not that much with generally opposed to the idea. I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I won't tell you what the idea is, but let me tell you this much - I'm one of those generally opposed to the idea that is supposedly being hailed but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie!The handling of tension and alien terror is superb - I've seen all the Men in Blacks, Predators, Aliens, Independence Days etc etc that have been thrown at as within the past ten years and let me tell you, this is BY FAR the among the best alien invasion movies to date.Director M. Night has some of the most amazing directorial talent that has surfaced in recent times in Hollywood and all of his past three films (the two previous ones being Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) have been fantastic, each in its different way. It is just amazing how this guy manages to craft three so different yet so absolutely intriguing and perfect movies in a row.As for this specific movie, I cannot remember when I was last gripped with so much suspense I had skin crawling all over during the climactic finale (must have been The Matrix). Additionally, this movie produced some of the best startling scenes in recent memory - a truly innocent situation involving a dog which almost made me spill hot tea all over myself. It's been years since any movie has truly and honestly startled me. Forget all the 'SLAM! (door shuts unexpectedly)' or 'oh my god, it was only the cat!' el-cheapo thrills 'horror' movies seem to be relying upon more and more these days (just finished watching 'Halloween Resurrection' a few days prior, a prime example) - Signs has directorial talent written all over it, it grips you and never lets you go until the satysfying conclusion, or maybe even not then.The one thing I'm ambivalent about is the director's continual references to India throughout his movies. In a way its cute, the director himself being a Hindu, but sometimes his Hindu characters (including those played by himself) appear out of place. In a way its a nice Hitchcockian touch, in another it is a bit distracting.The other thing I was initially taken aback was the lack of Bruce Willis or Haley Joel Osmond and their substitution with Mel Gibson and another kid of the seemingly endless stream Culkins. I know Willis or Osmond weren't even considered for these roles, but it would have been nice to have a pure-blooded trilogy complete with the same excellent actors. It didn't take much for me though to accept Gibson and Culkin, they were excellent in their roles.The conclusion itself though, I do admit, may be lacking for some. Those people probably loved Independence Day and were waiting for something similar. I for one HATED Independence Day (an embodyment of stupid film-making taken to the extreme) so I cannot express my thanks enough here to mr M. Night for giving us such a perfect alien invasion movie, truly worthy of the more demanding and intelligent yet still fun- and suspense-loving movie-goers out there. Its about time someone took a different approach and told a different story than the hopelessly dated 'kill mothership/main alien during the finale thus saving the world' dribble which has been told just way too many times already.Once again, thank you mr M. Night, for this movie experience to remember - needless to say, I'm breathless in anticipation for your next movie, but even if it's not worthy of your three previous ones, you will still have made movie-making history with your existing trilogy as it is.",8,0,1,25 November 2002
Happy Feet," Utter drivel
","Oh no, not another wasted two hours of my life. I wanted to turn it off 15 minutes into it, but since I was entertaining a guest who seemed to be enjoying it, I just sat through it.The singing and dancing was plain annoying. The supposedly talented tap-dancing of the lead penguin looked to me exactly like it looked to all his fellow penguins - stupid. And why on earth the female lead penguin felt so attracted to the obvious loser slow-developing twitchy-leg squeaky-voice male lead penguin, when there were plenty of buff penguins around, I have no idea. Too bad all the penguins looked alike as well. Or what was the point of those five short hispanic penguins? Why five? Two would have sufficed. Or was the point to reaffirm, that hispanics only travel in gangs? Anyway - hispanic penguins? Or Scottish penguins? Australian penguins? Please. Or how come all the different species (seals, penguins, birds) were able to talk fluently to each other, yet they couldn't communicate with humans? As for the voice acting, I've never understood the point of hiring well-known actors to voice animated characters. There was a Nicole Kidman? Where? Elijah Wood? Really? On the other hand, it was beyond annoying to hear Robin Williams' voice come out of more than one character's mouth. His voice is just too distinctly recognizable for that to work. The point is - 'superstar' voices either get lost or become distracting, whereas hiring talented voicers without big names lets you just concentrate on the movie without having to guess who's who or becoming annoyed by the too recognizable voices.Oh yeah, and wait till you see the most twisted depiction of a seal. Killer sharks don't even hold a candle to the seals that seem to be living on the south pole.And the conclusion? Humanity decides to stop fishing where penguins live, so that they'd have more food available - because people discover that penguins can tap-dance and they think its cute and funny. Oh and the penguins are sooo happy to please people with their tap-dancing too. Disgusting. Because what about all the other endangered species in the world? Do they have any hope of survival only if they learn some circus acrobatics or clown tricks to amuse humans? And if they don't, they'll be driven extinct because they are not 'cute and amusing' enough? My god. Who on earth came up with this plot.My rating - two stars. One for the effort - I mean people did work on this movie after all, so that has to account for something. The other for when the lead penguin was small. He was kind'a cute, even with those annoying twitchy legs.",2,1,4,28 June 2007
Mad Max: Fury Road," I thought they didn't make action movies like this anymore...
","I am your atypical action movie fan, as I usually fall half asleep during chase scenes, since I really don't care for the usually accompanying shoddy shaky-cam camerawork plus I find cars and speeding utterly boring to begin with. For me, car chases are the low point of any action movie and half of the time, I am tempted fast-forward to the 'good parts'. Sounds like I'd be in for a most disappointing movie experience with this movie, since Fury Road is more or less a two hour car chase. Boy was I wrong. I can't recall when was the last time I was so enthralled with the relentless on-screen action. What I especially like about the movie, is that while battle fatigue is always a concern with heavier action movies and could easily set in even within a few minutes in lesser movies, but not this time, as George Miller manages to keep things constantly fresh, interesting and exciting throughout this relentless two hour chase. Not only that, but he also manages to rev up the engine ever so slightly throughout the movie, that even though the action already starts on high speed, it just keeps gathering more speed right until the very end. As for the the car chase, apparently most other action movies just don't know how to do a proper car chase but finally someone has done it right. While other movies have iconic action scenes, this movie is just one colossal action scene from start to finish. An absolutely towering achievement in the genre of action movies, I hope this movie will shine a path for many like-minded movies to come.",9,3,5,17 April 2020
