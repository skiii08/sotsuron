Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good movie but not extraordinary !
","Well i must confess before commenting this movie that i'm a great Star Trek fan and anyone know the great rivality between the fan of the two franchises.  Well i never hate Star Wars but more the hardcore fans of SW who often attack Star Trek without great arguments like the Star Destroyer is bigger than the Entreprise so Star Wars is better than Star Trek you see what i'm talking about..., this debate is another story so it would be all for this...  So i go see this movie with the betters intentions in the world i also try to be objective and i put my Vulcan logic aside to replace it by the mythological and the fairy tales stuff of Lucas... Well its a good movie with beautiful eyes candies the space ships are beautiful and all this stuff ... But what about the characters. i left with the impression they have nothing interesting to say some will argue that SW isn't about character development well i don't think so the 3 others movies were somewhat interesting on this subject but the Phantom Menace just don't get it ! One other thing is Anakin at the end of the movie blowing out everything so easily !  Again some will say don't took it too seriously its Star Wars well i think Episode IV V VI were more serious but at same time were appealing to the children but Episode 1 fail on this its too child orienting !  Another things i didn't like is the race, it was cool but i think it was too long... it was also a way for Lucas to sell more video games ...  The first hour of this movie is simply boring and the other hour kick a$$ !  Now i will pass to the more positive aspect of the movie, the final lightsaber combat between Darth Maul and the 2 jedi are simply great and exciting ! Finally i think its a good movie maybe i will see it another time but more than two times i think its fanatism ... well i'm a little fanatic when it came for Star Trek stuff so i understand the Star Wars fans ...",8,8,11,25 May 1999
U-571," Great movie !
","U-571 is just a great movie despite that the movie is fictional this movie is inspire by 'real stories' and by history and technical fact that made it credible and plausible but don't get it wrong the movie is still action packed.  This movie is a great combination of suspense, action, war drama and naval tactic !  The special effect are particularly well done and not overuse troughout the movie one of my favorite scene is when the U-boat fire a torpedo that just make a scratch on the U-571 !  Finally, i would recommend this movie to anyone who love war story, naval battle and action !",9,1,5,23 May 2000
Gladiator," One of the Greatest movies i have seen
","I'm not a historian but i did some research and read others comments and Gladiator isn't very historicly accurate ... but Titanic wasn't much too and i haven't seen many people complain about it ... So why Gladiator should perfectly history accurate ???... the plot is romanced in the way to make a great emotional feel and i don't see anything wrong with it ...  At the very first moment of the movie i knew that i would enjoy it the score by Hans Zimmer & Lisa Gerrard during the battle with the barbarian is really great, we have the feeling of all the 'grandeur' of the Roman army, its like nothing can't stand in the way of this highly technical advanced army for this time ... The brutality of the combat (a la Braveheart) is true to what it most have been during this time ... The rest of the movie is just great fight scene, special effect a very well done and not overuse and good dialogue ... Finally i just love the theme of this movie of honor, loyalty and courage values that we should preserve in our modern society ... 9/10",10,0,0,12 June 2000
