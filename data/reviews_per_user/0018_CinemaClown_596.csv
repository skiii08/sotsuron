Ford v Ferrari," Will Satisfy Both Racing Enthusiasts & Casual Filmgoers
","From the director of Logan comes a full-throttled, high-octane & adrenaline-fuelled sports drama that recounts the rivalry between Ford & Ferrari for the dominance at Le Mans endurance race in 1966. Ford v Ferrari (also known as Le Mans '66) is no doubt stylishly filmed & furiously paced but it also travels a rather safe route for the most part and isn't as memorable as its genre's finest offerings.Directed by James Mangold, the film centres its plot on Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles while rivalry between two big corporations plays second fiddle to their stories. The racing segments are plentiful and are shot with kinetic flair. But the attempt to make the drama all macho & cool does not always deliver the best results as it dilutes the seriousness the film was aiming for, and appears as if it's trying too hard to grab our attention.Nevertheless, the relation between man & machine is captured with purity, and that bonding remains intact from start to finish. Instead of two corporations battling it out for supremacy in endurance racing, the story derives its conflict from disagreements that arise within Ford's racing crew & corporate executives. This element does keep the interest alive but the dramatic portions do not pack the same grip & punch that the racing scenes do.Matt Damon & Christian Bale are brilliant in their respective roles of Shelby & Miles, both individually & when sharing screen together. Damon is focused in his rendition while Bale embodies his role in ways only he can, thus adding another terrific input to his résumé. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a competently crafted & technically polished biopic that narrates the real-life events with gusto and is fun, thrilling & entertaining enough to satisfy both racing enthusiasts & casual filmgoers. Certainly worth a shot.",Null,0,3,19 November 2019
The Blair Witch Project," A Landmark In Horror Filmmaking And Still The Most Influential Found Footage Film
","Incorrectly labelled by many as the film that launched the found footage subgenre of horror, The Blair Witch Project was a new type of scare for the majority of mainstream audience at its time of release. It was promoted as retrieved footage before its premiere, the fate of the cast was kept secret, and it was filmed in a way most home movies are made, due to which many were easily sold by its gimmick.The Blair Witch Project concerns three film students who decide to produce a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. They travel to Maryland forest on a two day hike to find evidence to support the myth but never returned. A year later, their camera was found in the woods with the film in it. The surviving footage was eventually compiled into a movie that captures what really happened to them.Written, directed & edited by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sánchez, The Blair Witch Project is a cleverly crafted cinema that gets right where most found-footage films go wrong. Here, the reason why its camera is on & around all the time actually makes sense. The story is simple and its the simplicity of it all that makes it interesting. And by not showing any supernatural entity on camera, it allows the viewers' imagination to run wild.The shooting location & setting add a few elements of its own to the picture. Using the real names of the cast brings more plausibility to what the film claims to be. The camera-work is raw, unrefined, grainy & poorly handled, which ultimately works in its favour. Its 81 minutes of footage raises the tempo quite nicely. And since the cast is responsible for shooting the film & keep the dialogue running in a natural manner, they did a pretty good job at it.On an overall scale, The Blair Witch Project may not look as effective today as it did during its time of release but it still ranks amongst the best examples of found footage horror. And what it lacks in conventional horror elements, it makes up with the fear of the unknown that connects its viewers with those trio of characters plus the situation they find themselves in, and that, in my opinion, is its biggest strength. A landmark in horror filmmaking and still the most influential of all found-footage flicks, this faux documentary comes recommended.",Null,1,2,6 October 2015
The King's Speech," One of the Best Films of 2010 & Certainly the One with the Best Cast.
","Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Tom Hooper's The King's Speech may not seem quite worthy of its prestigious honour on looking back today but its admirable visual flair, gorgeous set pieces, superb direction & magnificent performances do manage to lift it over the above-average level even if its story feels inadequately paced & not very compelling.A British historical drama set from 1925 to 1939, The King's Speech tells the story of King George VI who, in order to cope with his stammer, enlists the help of a speech therapist and the film as a whole is his journey from his struggle with stutter to becoming the United Kingdom's voice during the outbreak of Second World War while also covering his friendship with his therapist.Directed by Tom Hooper, the subject matter is transitioned on the screen in meticulous detail with extensive attention given to its visual presentation to provide an authentic look to the whole premise. Also complimenting it is Alexandre Desplat's impressive score but the strongest aspects of this film are its high-quality performances, especially from Colin Firth & Geoffrey Rush.Colin Firth chips in with a career best work & is immensely convincing in the role of King George VI. Geoffrey Rush delivers a calm but firmly controlled performance as the speech therapist, and the scenes between the two are the film's real highlights. Helena Bonham Carter is almost always amazing no matter what role she plays & even Guy Pearce surprises here with a commendable performance.On an overall scale, The King's Speech is a mixed bag that critics found way too much to praise about back when it was released & although it's possibly one of the best films of its year, it certainly isn't the best. The film is at its finest when it's trying to portray the fear & frustration of King George VI with his speech disorder but as a monarch drama, it remains an underwhelming experience for the most part. Worth a shot, nonetheless.",Null,2,4,25 February 2011
Despicable Me 2," Hilarious As Hell But Also Emotionally Hollow
","Hilarious as hell thanks to total Minion madness, but also completely hollow at its core due to the absence of the very ingredient that made its predecessor an unexpected success of its year, Despicable Me 2 is an unabashedly funny ride when the screen is occupied by the little yellow henchmen but apart from that, everything about this sequel is a step down.The follow-up to Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2 continues the journey of Gru as the ex- supervillain finds himself adjusting to a normal family life with his three daughters & is also attempting an honest living in the jam business. But when he is recruited by the Anti-Villain League for assistance in their latest investigation, his prime suspect turns out to be a legendary supervillain, presumed dead long ago.Co-directed by Pierre Coffin & Chris Renault, Despicable Me 2 features an action-packed plot, more characters & major upgrades in minions screen time but it still ends up finishing as an inferior sequel for the charm, freshness & heart of the original is sorely missing. Even its attempt at humour feels forced at times, the plot follows a generic route & the new voice cast don't bring any sort of novelty to their characters either.The technical aspects are pretty much the same as the original. Cinematography adds more colours to its palette, Editing could've used a little more trimming for there are scenes that don't contribute to its story at all, background score has the feel of the original, and the 3D animation also offers a slight improvement over its predecessor. But its writers are always trying to conceal its paper-thin plot by sugarcoating it with more minion segments.It's in the moments without the minions where the film's shortcomings are clearly exposed. Gru's arc is demoted from a cool supervillain to a boring hero although Steve Carell does chip in with another impressive work. However Gru's three daughters are sidelined for the most part. The minions once again steal the show effortlessly with their slapstick antics & hilarious impressions and it's only because of them that the film isn't a chore to sit through.On an overall scale, Despicable Me 2 is a passable sequel to Despicable Me that may lack the heartfelt emotions of its predecessor but makes up for it with its roller-coaster minions madness. A delightful, light-hearted & crazy fun ride for viewers of all ages, this follow-up chapter will manage to leave most families satisfied but for those who were looking forward to something more than the usual minion mischief are bound to leave with a slight feeling of incompleteness.",Null,0,0,10 July 2015
Insidious: Chapter 2," A Highly Predictable & Forgettable Sequel That's Severely Lacking In Plot & Character Development
","At its time of release, Insidious was hailed by numerous critics & viewers alike as one of the finest works of contemporary horror, a consensus I didn't agree with at all. For me, it had the ingredients to finish as one of the most effective chillers, not to mention that its first half was a masterwork of tension building but, thanks to the utterly ridiculous & laughable set of events that unfolded in the next half, the entire experience was pretty much ruined.Insidious: Chapter 2 suffers from the same issues that plagued its predecessor, in addition to a few more. James Wan once again succeeds in establishing an unnerving atmosphere and employs both camera & sound to good effect but it lacks the freshness of the original, its storyline is predictable, and the surprises are few & far in between, not to mention that its moments of tension don't linger for long unlike before, thus diminishing their impact by an extent.Picking up right where the first film left off, the story of Insidious: Chapter 2 follows the Lambert family as they relocate to a different house while police investigates everything that transpired at their previous residency. Soon, the family comes to realise that whatever was haunting them back in their old house has followed them to the new place, and with Josh exhibiting strange behaviour, the ladies take it upon themselves to get to the truth of all this & end it for once n all.Directed by James Wan (best known for Saw & The Conjuring), Insidious: Chapter 2 begins with a prologue that covers the part that was only hinted in the previous chapter while also playing a key role later in the story. Numerous moments tie up with events that were left unexplained in the first chapter but it still doesn't pack a strong punch this time. The tone is darker than the last time and suspense builds up quickly too but the story just isn't engaging enough on an emotional level.The look n feel of the first film is skilfully duplicated but just like before, all the scenes taking place in purgatory realm are facepalm-inducing. The ghosts look funnier than frightening, and the scares work best only when the poltergeist activities are ongoing. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey & Ty Simpkins return to reprise their previous roles but their performances aren't any better than the last time plus the characters remain just as uninteresting as before.On an overall scale, Insidious: Chapter 2 works in bits n pieces and is able to use its setting & eerie atmosphere to desired effect at times but it is so predictable & lacking in surprises that just sitting through this sequel is a tedious job in itself. The non-linear narrative structure fails to conceal the shortcomings in its plot & characters and the negatives outweighs the positives by a considerable extent this time. Fans of the original may find a few redeemable qualities about this second chapter but for me, Insidious: Chapter 2 is instantly forgettable.",Null,0,0,10 September 2016
The Lobster," Weird, Whacky & Wicked But Also Dull, Sterile & Vapid.
","Weird, whacky & wicked but equally dull, sterile & vapid, The Lobster is a strange beast that actually begins quite well but tumbles down the road after the halfway mark to conclude on a rather uninteresting note. The concept is no doubt intriguing and it takes its time to make us familiar to the society inhabiting its tale but all of it doesn't amount to much in the end & it fails to leave any lasting impression.Set in a dystopian future, The Lobster presents a world in which single people are arrested & taken to a hotel where they are obliged to find a matching partner within 45 days or they are transformed into animals & released into the woods. The plot follows David who arrives at the hotel for the same reason but his endeavours of finding a mate before his time is over ends far more tragically than he expected.Co-written & directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, The Lobster marks his English-language debut and the idea & inspiration behind it is both clever & admirable. The sequences taking place in the hotel are nicely carried out but its second half lacks the same level of creativity that's present in the first half. The excitement goes missing once the protagonist leaves the hotel and from there on, it just limps throughout its remaining runtime.The hotel is neatly maintained but it also has a creepy vibe about it. Camera movements are fluid, colour hues wonderfully compliment its overcast ambiance and lighting seems natural for the most part. Editing allows the plot to unfold at an unhurried pace but the whole story feels twice as long because of that, with no idea of where it's headed. Last, the background score is just as odd as the story's content and is intermittently utilised.Coming to the performances, The Lobster features a fine cast in Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw & John C. Reilly and most of them are simply bland & lifeless in their respective roles. It can be argued that the spiritless rendition of these scripted people was deliberate but it doesn't really help in enriching the experience, at all. The deadpan wit is occasionally amusing but it's also too easy to get frustrated by whatever is happening.On an overall scale, The Lobster is an uncanny mix of bizarre ideas that, in its effort to play with multiple things at once, may end up drifting many of its viewers. While I found nothing lovable about it, its parody of the society that gives way too much credit to companionship, in addition to the dig it takes at those match-making algorithms which rely on similar traits & likeness factor is one aspect I liked but in all seriousness, The Lobster is too mediocre to be of any significance.",Null,277,404,18 December 2015
Moneyball," A Film About Baseball That Easily Transcends Its Game
","A film about baseball that effortlessly transcends its game, an interesting study of the clash between the conventional & new approach, and a highly polished drama that packs in a lot of heart, soul & inspiration, Moneyball is a fabulously crafted, expertly narrated & brilliantly performed picture that enters the film arena as an underdog but leaves everyone surprised by the time it finishes, much like its subject matter.Based on actual events, the story of Moneyball follows Billy Beane; the general manager of Oakland Athletics who's given a low-budget team to prepare for the upcoming season. Very disappointed with the limited payroll, he hires a new assistant and decides to put his radical theory to test when it comes to scouting & analysing players, eventually putting together a team of undervalued players who later go on to script history.Co-written by Steven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin, and directed by Bennett Miller, Moneyball is a big shot of inspiration that hits many home-runs over the course of its runtime and features Brad Pitt in one of his strongest roles. The screenplay is a pure gem and Miller does a terrific job in transitioning it on the silver screen for his direction here brims with confidence and he approaches the story with a clear vision of what the film needs to be.The technical aspects are firmly executed under the director's supervision. Set pieces are finely detailed, shooting locations carry an authentic feel, Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera to capture all the action on & off the field, and also gives it a grassy visual flair, Editing keeps the plot real tight & gripping and provides a favourable pace to the whole narrative, while Michael Danna's score makes its presence felt only when it's required.Coming to the acting department, Moneyball features a reliable cast in Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill & Phillip Seymour-Hoffman, and all of them chip in with commendable performances. Pitt is the real star here for he commands the screen with full authority and performs his duties with finesse. Hill also delivers a strong supporting work as assistant GM while Hoffman is at his usual best and the chemistry these three actors share with each other lifts the story up by a great deal.On an overall scale, Moneyball is one of the best films of its year & amongst the finest examples of its genre that benefits most from its impeccable writing & solid direction. The rejection of unorthodox ideas, the errors in management style, the continued use of outdated methods & favouring polished pebbles over diamonds are few of the elements that goes beyond the arena of baseball and Moneyball makes these points heard loud & clear without preaching it. An intensely captivating & thoroughly entertaining experience, Moneyball comes highly recommended.",Null,2,3,2 July 2015

Angels & Demons," Slightly More Bearable Than 'The Da Vinci Code'
","Suffering from the same set of issues that plagued its predecessor, Angels & Demons manages to be at least a little more entertaining than The Da Vinci Code, thanks to its swift pace & consistently moving narrative, but the ridiculous twists & endless expositions don't make the ride any smoother.The story of Angels & Demons follows symbologist Robert Langdon who this time teams up with a nuclear physicist to solve another murder and prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican while the Roman Catholic Church prepares for one of its most significant events; the election of the next Pope.Directed by Ron Howard, this sequel utilises the original's blueprint and is once again marred by a slew of nonsensical twists & absurd revelations, however, this time, it doesn't feel as stationary as the first film. A better pace does help in keeping the interest alive for a longer duration but the end result is still underwhelming.Performances offer no improvement, for Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon in the same flat manner as he did the last time and the new cast around him is just as forgettable. Its dynamic camera-work keeps the plot in motion and while its fast pace is a welcome upgrade, its never-ending exposition rarely makes sense yet keeps on rambling.On an overall scale, Angels & Demons is another incompetently directed, poorly written & lifelessly acted entry in Robert Langdon's film series but it's richly photographed, briskly edited & features a thrilling score which makes it slightly more bearable than The Da Vinci Code. A lesser trudging film of the two, Angels & Demons may still evoke a yawn or two.",Null,0,0,13 June 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Every Step She Has Taken, Every Enemy She Has Faced, Has Led To This!
","The remaining half of the whole bloody affair that was put into motion by the massacre that took place at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 picks up right from where Vol. 1 signed off and continues The Bride's roaring rampage of revenge but in an entirely different fashion as Tarantino allows the plot & character development part to catch up to the frenzy, kinetic madness of the first to finish his saga without leaving any loose ends.I guess almost everyone who ventured into Vol. 2 anticipating the same breakneck, thrilling & action-packed roller-coaster ride that Vol. 1 provided was left bemused & underwhelmed by what Vol. 2 had in store for them as Quentin Tarantino does a U-turn by applying brakes on the action and filling the plot with more dialogues, backstories & emotional complexities, thus turning this saga into a revenge dish that tastes better when experienced together.After seeing her being betrayed & then watching her seek her revenge, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 finds The Bride going after the remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad but before this tale of bloody retribution reaches its climax, it also focuses on few unanswered questions, like how did she become such a deadly assassin, who Bill really is & what led to the ultimate betrayal. And when it at last reaches its climactic showdown, Tarantino throws in another curveball.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, the second half of Kill Bill feels entirely different in comparison to the first half as this master filmmaker approaches the remaining chapters by taking an alternate route that finds the writer-director slowing down the pace considerably, unfolding the events in dialogue-driven fashion, addressing the characters' origins, toning down the blood-splattered action, and even changes the whole texture of the very moment this entire story had been heading towards.The screenplay exhibits the usual Tarantino charm & wit, its homage to spaghetti westerns, Chinese wuxia, Japanese samurai films & other genres continues, Editing allows the plot to spread out a bit further but it lacks the tight, rigid structure of Vol. 1, thus resulting in a few plodding moments in its 136 minutes runtime, Cinematography carries the same vibe of the first half, and the existing musical tracks incorporated into this remaining picture continues to impress even if it isn't as seamlessly integrated as the last time.Coming to the performances, Uma Thurman reprises her role of The Bride and chips in with an even better input this time. Supporting her all the way is an excellent ensemble of David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah & Gordon Liu who play Bill, Budd, Elle & Pai Mei, respectively. Carradine lives up to his character's reputation, Madsen brings Budd to life in a reserved manner, Hannah is simply as manic as she appeared in her brief cameo in Vol. 1 while Liu plays the martial arts teacher with required over-the-top exaggeration.On an overall scale, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 may not be as enjoyable & gratifying as Vol. 1 but what it lacks in relentless carnage & unabashed spectacle of Vol. 1, it makes up in deeper examination of its characters & their motivations. While I was one of those viewers who felt cheated by its lacklustre final standoff during my first watch, I've only come to appreciate it more n more with every subsequent viewing as Tarantino turns what should have been an epic confrontation into an unexpectedly tragic & heartbreaking farewell. People will always be divided over which is the better volume but as a whole, Kill Bill delivers on all fronts.",Null,0,1,27 December 2015

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Exists To Only Set The Stage For The Finale
","While the splitting of the final novel in the Harry Potter film series was more than justified by the adaptations that followed, it also gave these major Hollywood studios another idea of how to milk any franchise for all its worth, thus resulting in few unnecessary expansions of final chapters of many other franchises into two films & The Hunger Games series is the latest to join this particular league.While I wasn't completely won over by the first two films in this franchise & watched them with half-hearted interest, the films weren't as terrible as I expected. Both instalments did make up for some nice lightweight entertainment & fabulously exhibited the screen power of Jennifer Lawrence but the only reason why The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 exists is to set up the stage for the upcoming finale.Set after the events of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mockingjay - Part 1 continues the story of Katniss Everdeen who finds herself in District 13 after being rescued from the 75th Hunger Games arena which she destroyed in the last chapter. Very much aware of the mass riots that has risen against the Capitol, Everdeen reluctantly agrees to become the symbol of rebellion in order to unite all districts against one enemy & also tries to rescue Peeta from his captivity.Directed by Francis Lawrence, Mockingjay - Part 1 lacks many elements that made the first two instalments click so well. The action is very much missing here, the story feels longer than its actual runtime, nothing much happens in the movie plot-wise & it's pretty evident that the idea of splitting it into two parts was indeed a stupid move. Jennifer Lawrence still delivers another fine performance while the contribution from both Julianne Moore & Philip Seymour Hoffman is a welcome one.On an overall scale, there isn't much to talk about The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 for it's a definite downgrade in almost all aspects when compared to its predecessors, carries over the usual political themes of the series but never does anything with it, is predictable from start to finish, is stretched beyond its threshold point & even has Lawrence exhibiting signs of weariness in her given role. Easily the weakest of the three instalments so far, Mockingjay - Part 1 may not be a worthy sequel but it nonetheless succeeds in setting the stage for the grand finale.",Null,6,7,22 March 2015
Vertigo," A Defining Work in the Career of Alfred Hitchcock.
","Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo arrives with a huge reputation to live up to because only a couple years back, it dethroned Orson Welles' Citizen Kane from the top spot in the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound critics' poll; a position Welles' magnum opus had held for 50 long years. But not only did Vertigo feel quite unworthy of its new-found position in the end but isn't even the most defining work of Hitchcock's glorious career.The film tells the story of a police detective who is forced into retirement after his fear of height results in the death of a policeman when he was on duty. He is eventually hired by an acquaintance as a private investigator whose job is to keep an eye on his beautiful wife who has been behaving very strangely of lately. The plot covers his inquiry into the matter while he becomes dangerously obsessed with her.The entire picture is expertly directed for it not only shows how experimental Hitchcock can get but also exhibited the effortless ease with which he was able to fuse art into every aspect of this film without compromising much with the entertainment factor. The first half plays out like a psychological horror with stunning unpredictability but it's the second half where the film went downhill for me with its take on love & loss.There are many things to like about this movie yet in the end it ends up feeling a tad too overlong & concludes on a slightly unsatisfying note. Cinematography captures its events gorgeously & is responsible for the existence of dolly zoom technique in cinema, editing could've used a few more trims in the second half, background score by Bernard Herrmann wonderfully reflects its themes and the performances by James Stewart & Kim Novak are no slouch.On an overall scale, Vertigo is a brilliantly crafted & artistically appealing cinema that hasn't aged very well considering that countless imitation has taken away most of its mystery elements & its ending isn't very difficult to deduce but this psychological thriller still has enough fuel to surprise many in certain aspects and although I don't agree with its new tag of 'greatest film of all time', I can't deny its significant contribution to world cinema.A second viewing some other time might change my perception towards it but as of now, Vertigo was an underwhelming experience.",Null,2,4,7 October 2013

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Absolutely Worth Skipping!
","Terribly written, poorly directed & shoddily performed, the fourth instalment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series is an insipid, pathetic & horribly executed chapter that takes whatever right was left about the original trilogy and brings it to an absolute low for this movie is not only the weakest film of the franchise but also one of the worst films ever made.A stand-alone sequel to the previous three movies, the story of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides finds Captain Jack Sparrow embarking on a new journey to find the fabled Fountain of Youth but on his way comes across a woman from his past who's the daughter of the feared pirate, Blackbeard, and discovers that they are also looking for the same place.Directed by Rob Marshall, On Stranger Tides begins a new phase in the famous adventure fantasy series after Gore Verbinski wrapped up his story with three films yet this latest entry is such an uninspiring, tedious & unnecessary instalment that it makes even the least impressive film of the previous trilogy look like an under-appreciated classic for there isn't one thing that this movie gets right.Even the technical aspects aren't up to the mark and that's disappointing when considering the fact that On Stranger Tides is the most expensive film ever made. The exotic locations are wonderfully captured by the camera but it fails to immerse the viewers into the narrative plus thanks to useless editing, its 137 minutes of runtime is severely felt, while the score by Hans Zimmer is inferior but still fitting for the most part.Visual Effects also exhibit a downgrade when compared to its predecessors and on various occasions isn't convincing at all. Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush & Kevin McNally are the only ones reprising their roles from previous features while the new additions include Penélope Cruz & Ian McShane who play Angelica (Jack's former lover) & Blackbeard (the prime antagonist), and the performance by the entire cast is, in one word, terrible.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a sequel that shouldn't have been made in the first place. The previous three films by Gore Verbinski may not rank amongst the finest trilogies ever made but it had a wit & charm of its own plus was perfectly good in a way. Even Captain Jack Sparrow fails to keep the interest alive this time and is annoying for the most part.

While some will appreciate the meditative approach & aesthetic eye with which this tale is brought to life, others will feel challenged & frustrated by its glacial pace & endless musings.

Scarface," Worth A Shot For Pacino's Breathtaking Performance Alone.
","Written by Oliver Stone, directed by Brian De Palma & starring Al Pacino in the most vicious role of his career, Scarface is widely considered as a defining classic of its genre & also works as one fascinating character study but what single-handedly elevates this crime drama to a certain level of greatness is Pacino's unforgettable rendition of his character, Tony Montana.A remake of the 1932 film of the same name, Scarface tells the story of Tony Montana; a Cuban immigrant who arrives in 1980s America with nothing but then rapidly rises to become a powerful drug lord. Extremely protective of his younger sister, disowned by his mother & driven by his greed for more power, the plot covers his journey to the top & the fall that soon followed.De Palma's direction takes a raw approach in bringing Stone's screenplay to life & makes excessive use of bright colours while painting an overt portrait of 1980s Miami but its very own unrefined presentation also ends up turning the whole experience a bit cumbersome for it isn't the story but Pacino's show-stealing performance that invites the viewers into its premise & glues the film together.Camera-work is skilfully carried out & pretty much succeeds in creating an atmosphere that feels quite otherworldly. Its 170 minutes of runtime is felt on many occasions for there were moments it could've sped through or trimmed entirely but when everything clicks, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen. And then there is Giorgio Moroder's brilliant score that wonderfully integrates with its narrative.As far as performances go, Scarface is Al Pacino's show all the way. Having made a career full of terrific performances, this is where he puts every single doubt about his acting ability to rest & just like Tony Montana, announces himself as the finest actor of his era. His work here is so intimidating that it overshadows every other aspect of the picture. And he's excellently supported by Michelle Pfeiffer & others who chip in with fine contributions.On an overall scale, Scarface may not have lived up to its strong legacy purely from a storytelling perspective but its massive cult following is understandable. Covering themes of greed, addiction & power, bringing on screen its brutal take on American dream, and wrapping itself up on a high with what's easily one of cinema's most explosive finales, Scarface presents itself as what it is, without pretending or sugarcoating, and is worth a shot for Pacino's acting alone for it made Tony Montana truly immortal in the annals of cinema.",Null,1,3,13 March 2015

","From the writer-director of Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke & the Academy Award winning Spirited Away comes another spellbinding journey into the creative world of this highly revered filmmaker. Howl's Moving Castle continues the remarkable success streak of Hayao Miyazaki's esteemed film career & is a fascinating take on old age difficulties, futility of war & magic of love, all encapsulated with Miyazaki's unique storytelling ability & infused with his distinct artistic flavour.Howl's Moving Castle, on a superficial level, is a love story between Sophie; an unconfident young woman & Howl; a powerful but insecure wizard. When a witch, who's after Howl, casts a strong spell on Sophie which transforms her into a 90-year old woman, she moves out of town & travels to seek a cure for her spell and eventually finds shelter in Howl's strange & mobile castle. There she meets a fire demon amongst other acquaintances who offers to break her curse if Sophie is able to set him free from Howl's service.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Howl's Moving Castle features another intriguing drama that's effectively paced & expertly narrated by him. It also boasts a compelling set of characters amongst which Calcifer; the fire-demon, turned out to be the most interesting for me. Like all Miyazaki's films, the animation is impressive while the lush cinematography captures every moment in fine detail. The humour is nicely timed, the themes are elegantly explored & Joe Hisaishi's score wonderfully accompanies the whole drama with its blissful tracks.On an overall scale, Howl's Moving Castle may not rank amongst Miyazaki's finest works but this anime is still full of life, love, joy & magic. The only complaint I have is that the final 30 minutes are kind of messed up plus the ending feels slightly hurried up. Yet it doesn't take away much from the film as it still manages to transport its viewers to Miyazaki's wonderland and will surely leave most of them emotionally fulfilled & satisfied. Another visual wonder from start to finish by Studio Ghibli whose creativity never seems to tire out, Howl's Moving Castle is thoroughly recommended.",Null,0,1,23 May 2014
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Priceless Comedy From Sacha Baron Cohen!
","Making a complete mockery of everything in its path, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (simply known as Borat) is an absolute riot that's offensive, shocking & hilarious in every possible manner and despite the controversy it caused during its time of release, it remains one of the finest comedies of its decade.Borat tells the story of its titular character; a TV reporter in Kazakhstan who's sent to the 'U, S and A' by his government to make a documentary about American society & culture. Once there, he interacts & interviews numerous people in order to understand the American way of life and after watching an episode of Baywatch, falls in love with Pamela Anderson.Written by Sacha Baron Cohen & directed by Larry Charles, Borat works only because of Cohen for the actor is truly committed to his role and does a terrific job in bringing to life one of the vilest characters to ever grace the film canvas. Many segments present in the final print are unscripted & improvised on the spot and the hysterical reaction it is able to garner from its unsuspecting subjects is truly priceless.There are multitudes of rib-tickling moments to be found here for we witness Borat taking a course to understand American humour, mocking a panel of feminists, irking a rodeo crowd, insulting his hosts, making numerous anti-semitic, homophobic & sexist remarks, and many more situations that soon escalate into total madness. And yet, as the film nears its closing moments, it goes on to show that it has a heart of its own.On an overall scale, Borat is an insane exercise in crude humour that spares nothing & no one over the course of its runtime, captures the ignorance & tolerance of American society quite effectively, and benefits a lot from Sacha Baron Cohen's swashbuckling performance which single-handedly elevates this mockumentary to an instant classic status. Enjoyable, entertaining & filled with moments you can't help but laugh despite being aware of its utter offensive nature, Borat is definitely worth a shot and comes delightfully recommended.",Null,1,1,22 September 2015
Alien 3," Compared To Alien & Aliens, It's An Atrocity. As A Standalone Feature, It's Not That Bad.
","Alien³ often gets a lot of criticism from most fans of the first two chapters of Alien franchise & in a way it deserves that. In its very opening moments, this film makes a huge mistake of killing all the characters who survived in the last film, leaving behind only Ripley & thus taking the whole premise back to square one. Compared to Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, Alien³ is an atrocity. As a standalone feature however, it's not too shabby.Alien³ opens with the shot of escape pod carrying the survivors of the last film crash-landing on a prison-run refinery planet, killing all but Ellen Ripley. However, on researching about what caused the crash, she finds out that an alien organism was on board with them all the time. As the new-born alien matures & begins its killing spree, Ripley tries to warn the inhabitants about the grave situation they are in & eventually discovers a deeply disturbing secret about herself.Directed by David Fincher, the film marks his feature film debut but was a harrowing experience for him. Troubled production, numerous rewrites, shooting without a finished script, constant interruptions by the producers, creative differences & then a complete dismantling of the director's version by the studio & reworking the plot for its theatrical release, it's no wonder why Fincher left the project before production ended & still hates it more than anyone else.Despite having more budget than the previous two chapters combined, Alien³ is still a huge downgrade in every filmmaking department. There is less suspense, less action, no real sense of direction & it's far more predictable than expected. The sets do provide an inhospitable look to the film but there is nothing impressive about it. Camera-work isn't that bad while editing is fine considering that it's the pathetic screenplay that's the main culprit here.Coming to the performances, apart from the characters of Ellen Ripley & a couple more planet's inhabitants, the rest are present in the film as death fodders only. And although Sigourney Weaver chips in nicely as Ripley, others are found hamming like crazy in their given roles. The alien creature itself is given a new design but it's so poorly rendered that it never really looks like a part of the picture but a highly artificial entity superimposed on the screen.On an overall scale, Alien³ manages to work in bits n pieces and as a standalone film is slowly gaining a cult following of lately. It is quite entertaining, some sequences are excellently filmed, Weaver manages to impress again but the negatives far outweighs the positives this time as it really makes you wonder where the hell all its budget was spent on considering its poor visual effects, not-so-impressive set designs & shoddily rendered alien. It's best to approach this film without expecting anything like its predecessors or else you're destined to hate it.P.S. Make sure you grab the Assembly Cut instead of the Theatrical version for the former is little bit close to the rough vision David Fincher had in mind while crafting this feature.",Null,1,2,21 September 2014
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Inferior, Insipid & Uninspiring On All Levels.
","Despite making the right move of heading into the darker territory, the follow-up chapter to Sherlock Holmes fails to capitalise on the excellent platform provided by its predecessor and is a highly disappointing sequel that presents a downgrade in each storytelling element, tries too hard to be funny, and is also marred by its poor rendition of Holmes' arch-enemy.Following the events of the first film, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows continues the adventures of Detective Holmes & his companion, Dr. Watson, as they travel across Europe in a race to prevent their fiercest adversary, Professor Moriarty, from executing his sinister plot of starting a global war, only to find that their enemy is always one step ahead.Directed by Guy Ritchie, A Game of Shadows features more style & visual flair than its already impressive predecessor but fails to add anything of substance to its story or characters. Art direction is incredibly alluring, Camera-work adds a few more tricks up its sleeve but the use of slow-motion shots borders on excessive, Editing is terrible while Hans Zimmer's score is very much a rehash of the original.Coming to the performances, Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law reprise their respective roles of Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson and while their chemistry works, their performance was much better in the last picture. The new additions include Jared Harris, Noomi Rapace & Stephen Fry and all of them disappoint for Harris' Moriarty isn't intimidating at all, Rapace just wanders around while Fry is annoying at times.On an overall scale, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is inferior on all levels for this sequel completely fails to build on the solid foundation of its predecessor, is tedious to sit through, offers nothing captivating enough to keep the interest alive, and despite the modest expectations, fails to recreate the magic of the original. Putting more emphasis on action than its plot or characters, A Game of Shadows is an inferior, insipid & uninspiring movie that ends up making a mockery of two of Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creations.",Null,1,2,28 July 2015
The Incredible Hulk," As Forgettable As The First One
","Completely ignoring Ang Lee's 2003 feature about the same character as if it never existed, The Incredible Hulk is the second instalment in Marvel Cinematic Universe that marks yet another attempt to bring on screen the fascinating story of Bruce Banner & his alter ego. And while the first attempt was a disaster, the second venture is no jackpot material either.The Incredible Hulk tells the story of Dr. Bruce Banner; a nuclear physicist who is on the run from US military after an experiment carried out on him goes horribly wrong & transforms him into a green humanoid monster for a brief period of time whenever he's stressed, angry or excited. The plot covers Banner attempting to cure himself of his alter ego while a power-hungry soldier wants to become just like him.Directed by Louis Leterrier, The Incredible Hulk presents the green monster in its absolute form & captures the process of Banner becoming Hulk in brief flashbacks instead of going through it all over again. The first act is brilliantly done & is quite engaging but after that, everything starts heading downstream until it becomes laughably bad in its final moments.Coming to the performances, Edward Norton is nothing special in the role of Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler is annoyingly bad, Tim Roth gets to have few good moments while the rest just fill in ably in their given roles. Visual effects is a mixed bag for the CGI only becomes worse as story progresses. Hulk never appears convincing enough on the screen, Abomination is even worse & the action sequences are just hollow.On an overall scale, The Incredible Hulk is a very average output from the studio that began on a high with Iron Man. It's a mildly entertaining, empty-shelled & marginally passable piece of work that adds nothing to Marvel Cinematic Universe but then, it doesn't take away much from it as well. Watching it or skipping it won't make any difference in your Marvel marathon for this second attempt is almost as forgettable as the first.",Null,0,1,24 March 2015
Mission: Impossible III," Best Mission: Impossible Movie So Far!
","The third instalment in the Mission: Impossible film series is also the very first that manages to get every single thing right for it is an intensely engaging, relentlessly paced & absolutely thrilling sequel that packs in a riveting plot, crazy stunts, cool gadgets & explosive action to succeed as the finest chapter of its franchise and is great enough to rank amongst the best examples of its genre(s).The story of Mission: Impossible III concerns Ethan Hunt who has retired from the field work for IMF & now trains new recruits. But when one of his protégés is killed while investigating an international arms dealer, Hunt plans a mission & prepares a team to apprehend him but soon finds out that his latest adversary is far more dangerous than imaginable & is hellbent on taking away everything Hunt holds dear in his life.Co-written & directed by J.J. Abrams, Mission: Impossible III also marks the very beginning of his filmmaking career and he certainly couldn't have asked for a better start. This sequel does benefit from the new director's fresh insight as Abrams envisions the story as a never- ending chase and keeps it sprinting in only top gear from start to finish, thus never allowing its viewers a moment to settle down once the main plot surfaces.The screenplay tackles the shortcomings of previous chapters by adding more substance to its plot while also giving greater attention to its characters & their arcs. Production design is stellar, locations provide an exotic layer to its events, Cinematography makes excellent use of hand-held photography, the colour tones n textures encapsulates the story with a vibrant feel, and the dynamic movements of its camera wonderfully enhances its chaotic action.Thanks to its tight editing, its 125 minutes of runtime is fiercely paced plus its effectiveness can also be felt in those brilliantly-edited action or chase sequences. VFX team does make ample use of CGI but it never steps into the realm of absurdity. And last but not the least, the background score by Michael Giacchino is loud & bombastic but also incredibly fitting and is equally responsible for keeping the viewers firmly gripped to their seats throughout its runtime.Coming to the performances, Mission: Impossible III features a fabulous cast in Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michelle Monaghan & Ving Rhames with added input coming from Laurence Fishburne, Simon Pegg, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q & others. Cruise is at his most committed yet again but this time he's pretty much overshadowed by Hoffman's terrific rendering of his character and even in his limited screen time, he manages to leave the most lasting impression.On an overall scale, Mission: Impossible III is a fascinating blend of kinetic direction, solid script, exuberant camera-work, blistering pace, mind-blowing action, brilliant performances & fantastic score, all of which work in seamless harmony to deliver the goods in a manner that's far more enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying than expected. Although it isn't entirely flawless, Mission: Impossible III nonetheless works as a top-gear action spectacle that's clever, imaginative & downright fun. An absolute must for action aficionados.",Null,1,1,22 July 2015

Captain Phillips," A Brutally Intense, Edge-of-the-Seat Thriller.
","Captain Phillips is a brutally intense, edge of the seat thriller about the hijacking of an American cargo ship which took place in 2009 and ended with a stand-off between the US Navy & the Somali pirates' lifeboat from the cargo ship, where they held Captain Richard Phillips hostage. And without adding heroism or evilness to any of its characters, this film tries to capture the real event with as much authenticity as possible by keeping its potent drama at a human level while also making a statement against the myriad effects of globalization.Viciously crafted, explosively executed, incredibly entertaining & highly satisfying, this film is tailor-made for Paul Greengrass' directional style and benefits greatly from its gripping screenplay, bleak yet arresting photography, tight editing, tense ambiance, energetic pace and very impressive & captivating performances from Tom Hanks & newcomer, Barkhad Abdi, as Captain Richard Phillips & Somali pirate leader, Muse, respectively.Promising enough to make a prominent mark in the upcoming awards season, Captain Phillips is one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences of the year, so far and is escalated to thrilling heights by Paul Greengrass' kinetic direction & Tom Hanks' spectacular performance, who in the film's final moments, proves why he is hailed as one of the greatest actors of all time.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An Abhorrent, Nauseating & Cringeworthy Piece of Garbage Set In A Galaxy Far, Far Away
","An indiscriminatingly awful, facepalm-inducing, excessively cartoonish, unbelievably stupid & mind-numbingly pathetic piece of sh*t that deserves to be ranked amongst the worst atrocities ever committed on film canvas, the first chapter of George Lucas' prequel trilogy & fourth instalment in the Star Wars saga marks its creator's return to film direction after a 22-year hiatus and shows that world cinema was far better off without his directional inputs.Set three decades before the events of Star Wars in a galaxy far far away, the story of The Phantom Menace follows two Jedi Knights who are sent to negotiate a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute but when that falls apart, they flee from their hostile situation to warn the Queen and end up stumbling upon a young child who exhibits inherent powers of the Force and could be the chosen one. Meanwhile, a dormant Sith make his presence felt.Written & directed by George Lucas, the very first mistake he made was that he completely forgot who the target audience of his prequel trilogy really was. It was the people who made Star Wars such a groundbreaking revolution of its time, who in the passing years had grown up a little, and were probably expecting a slightly more mature take after waiting for so long. What Lucas churns out instead is an incredibly juvenile turd filled with annoying characters & reckless CGI.Lucas spent decades waiting for the filmmaking technology to advance to his required level in order to realise his prequel trilogy on film canvas as per his vision yet if he'd spent even a fraction of that time in refining the script & characters, The Phantom Menace would've been a much decent movie. Just about nothing works here and what makes it even more torturous to sit through is the annoying set of characters inhabiting it. The plot is pretty much absent & filled with people you just don't give a damn about.Its visual effects may have been a state-of-the-art stuff at its time of release but it has only deteriorated over the years and now it looks plainly rubbish. Nearly every sequence is filled with weird looking creatures for Lucas goes horribly smug about his half-assed imagination here but his first feature in over two decades is too childish & cartoonish to have any merit. Its 133 minutes of runtime isn't justified either for the whole movie is just one lame segment after another and every attempt at humour simply falls apart.And then there's this cast of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman & others who deliver truly hollow performances. Although acting never was this franchise's strongest suit, it's a shame to see such actors playing such empty, absurd characters. The only reason for the prequel trilogy to exist, as per Lucas, was to provide a backstory to the original trilogy's most iconic figure while the characters its fans actually fell in love with and wanted to see more of are completely sidelined or absent, which doesn't help its cause.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace will always be memorable for the priceless reaction it evoked from the die-hard fans of the original Star Wars trilogy. To see their long wait being rewarded with such an abhorrent, nauseating & disgusting chapter is undoubtedly hilarious but for someone who was never a fan of this franchise, movies don't get anymore cringeworthy than this. Filled with nothing but garbage, the only watchable scene in The Phantom Menace is that brief lightsaber duel near the end. Other than that, it's just third-degree torture.",Null,1,7,20 December 2015
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," We Accept The Love We Think We Deserve
","Crafted with genuine care n affection, told with heartfelt sensitivity & bolstered by three key performances, The Perks of Being a Wallpaper is an exquisite coming-of-age drama that beautifully captures the highs n lows of adolescent life, wonderfully illustrates the value n importance of friendship & remains one of the most heartwarming examples of its genre.Based on the novel of the same name, The Perks of Being a Wallflower tells the story of an introvert freshman who's incredibly shy in making friends, is coping up with the recent loss of his best friend & is desperately seeking the company of people he can feel comfortable with. Enter his two seniors who accept him as one of their own & welcome him to the real world.Written & directed by Stephen Chbosky who also wrote the novel this film is adapted from, The Perks of Being a Wallflower brims with creative energy, teenage spirit & strong passion for storytelling and is a highly impressive work for a debutant filmmaker. Thanks to its vivid use of colour palette, the visual presentation is incredibly refreshing while its 103 minutes of runtime passes by smoothly.Coming to the performances, The Perks of Being a Wallflower features an invigorating cast in Logan Lerman, Emma Watson & Ezra Miller, with all three of them delivering outstanding performances in their given roles. Lerman is truly a revelation here, Watson is mesmerising as always while Miller chips in with a strong contribution, and their spot-on chemistry with each other is the film's biggest highlight.On an overall scale, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a delightful surprise that also works as an intriguing meditation on loneliness, depression, companionship & the haunting effect one's past can have on his or her present. Purely honest with its content, sincerely adapted for the screen & up to the mark in all aspects of filmmaking, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an enjoyable, entertaining & emotionally uplifting cinema that's delightfully recommended.",Null,1,2,7 October 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," A Masterpiece Of Suspense, 10 Cloverfield Lane Is A Wholly Different Beast Compared To Cloverfield
","Surfacing without prior notice, filmed in absolute secrecy & marketed without giving away anything at all, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a masterpiece of suspenseful filmmaking that retains its air of mystery by always staying one step ahead of its viewers. Unpredictable, claustrophobic & making ingenious use of Hitchcockian elements, this orgy of twists n turns delivers the chills with great effectiveness and is further uplifted by stellar performances from its cast.The biggest mistake one can make while heading into this feature is to approach it as a full-fledged sequel to Cloverfield. Although it does share strands of DNA with that found-footage monster flick, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a different beast. The filmmakers leave a trail of references that connect the two plus there is similarity in their themes as well but this latest entry serves better as a blood relative than a literal sequel and is far more capable of standing on its own.The story of 10 Cloverfield Lane follows a young woman named Michelle who, after leaving her fiancé following an argument, is involved in a car accident. Waking up to find herself in an underground bunker, she is approached by a guy named Howard who tells her that an apocalyptic event has left the outside world inhabitable and claims to have saved her life. Also present is Emmett who confirms Howard's story but Michelle isn't convinced and attempts to find the truth all by herself.Directed by Dan Trachtenberg, 10 Cloverfield Lane is crafted with such precision & craftsmanship that it doesn't seem like the work of a first time filmmaker at all. A stunning debut by every means that instantly catapults Trachtenberg into the league of the most promising talents to look out for, its success is also attributed to Damien Chazelle's script that is refined to near-perfection and J.J. Abrams' supervision of the whole production that allowed the new director to spread his wings.The technical aspects are expertly executed and greatly help in intensifying its ominous ambiance. With majority of the plot unfolding in the underground shelter, the claustrophobic element sets up all by itself and is more amplified by the smooth tracking, steady zooms & piercing movements of the camera. Editing makes sure that the plot remains tightly-knitted, ideally paced & highly gripping from the first frame to the last, while Bear McCreary's background score elevates the tension to a nerve-wracking level.Coming to the performances, we get acquainted wth only three characters in this movie and all of them are given a well-defined arc. The cast comprises of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman & John Gallagher, Jr. and it isn't just the outstanding singular performances these actors deliver in their given roles but also the terrific chemistry they share with each other that makes us invest in them. Each actor compels the other one to bring their A-game to the table and while Winstead chips in with a strong input, it's Goodman who turns out to be the show-stealer.On an overall scale, 10 Cloverfield Lane is far better than what I expected it to be and undoubtedly ranks amongst the best films to surface this year. Confidently directed, cleverly scripted, skilfully photographed, impeccably edited, sensibly paced, stupendously performed & aptly scored, it is a downright intense, extremely captivating, incessantly stimulating, incredibly thrilling & ultimately rewarding edge-of-the-seat experience that will effortlessly manage to keeps its viewers guessing throughout its 103 minutes runtime. In short, whether you like Cloverfield or not, 10 Cloverfield Lane comes strongly recommended.",Null,2,2,18 July 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Promising Start & Strong Middle Ruined By A Final Misstep
","A sturdily crafted, sharply directed & strongly acted western drama that comes jam-packed with plenty of gunslinging action & dynamic interplay between its characters, 3:10 to Yuma exhibits ample depth in plot & characterisation and offers a thoroughly engaging ride for the most part, only to throw it all away in its final moments.Directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the period setting is recreated in fine detail but what drives this film are its well-rounded leads, each bestowed with an interesting arc while consistent dose of action keeps things alive n kicking as plot progresses. The finale is where Mangold loses his grip and is unable to wrap it up in a satisfying manner.The issue I have with the final showdown is that it isn't refined enough for us to buy such sudden change of heart. It betrays the character definition established prior to the third act and isn't convincing at all. Nonetheless, both Russel Crowe & Christian Bale bring their A-game to the table and deliver solid inputs in their respective roles, yet it is Ben Foster who steals the show.Overall, 3:10 to Yuma impresses in several aspects, both individually & collectively, and properly utilises all its ingredients to finish as a worthy example of its genre but the final step brings such an unexpected sudden halt to its momentum that it leaves behind an underwhelming aftertaste in its wake. I doubt many will mind the ending it settles for but after such promising start & middle, I expected a better conclusion.",Null,0,0,9 April 2020
The Expendables 2," Bigger, Better & Bloodier Than The Expendables
","Bigger, better & bloodier, The Expendables 2 is an explosive sequel to its predecessor that improves upon the original in almost every department & is a worthy addition to the newly established franchise. Continuing its homage to past action classics, the film hugely improves on the action, violence & humour aspects and the new recruits to its ensemble cast are unquestionably a welcome addition.The Expendables 2 continues the journey of the notorious band of elite mercenaries who are reunited for a new assignment which seems like a seemingly simple operation but when one of their own is murdered on the job, the mission evolves into a quest for revenge as the group tries to avenge their loss by going one on one against a formidable enemy who's also in possession of a deadly weapon.Directed by Simon West, the film opens on a high note with an impressive action sequence and never loses its high-octane fuel throughout its runtime. The direction is good, writing takes the premise into darker territories, the humour & references are nicely handled, camera-work is dynamic, editing improves the pacing & Brian Tyler's score provides the adrenaline rush in just the right doses.Coming to the performances, the reprising cast continues its job in the same fashion as before & it was pretty refreshing to see more of Schwarzenegger & Willis in this one. But what makes the ensemble all the more solid are the new additions in Liam Hemsworth as the latest member of Expendables, Chuck Norris in a hilarious cameo & Jean-Claude Van Damme as the main antagonist, at which the veteran brilliantly excels.On an overall scale, The Expendables 2 is an intensely enjoyable, highly entertaining & immensely satisfying action flick which delivers everything it promised and is better than the original in every way. From the excellent opening sequence to the final showdown between Stallone & Van Damme, it never tries to hold back the blood, gore or violence which I really appreciate. A definite must for fans of the original.",Null,0,0,7 November 2014
Source Code," An Explosive, Thrilling & Extremely Entertaining Ride That Refuses To Slow Down From Start To Finish
","An explosively paced, cleverly narrated & expertly executed sci-fi extravaganza that's intriguing, exciting & engaging, and packs in just about enough twists n turns to keep its viewers around for the majority of its runtime, Source Code is a fascinating mix of kinetic direction, smart screenplay, energetic camera-work, tight editing & apt performances, and is one of the most rewarding films of its year.Set in the near future, the story of Source Code follows a US Army captain who inexplicably finds himself aboard a commuter train which explodes only minutes later. Regaining consciousness in a pod this time, he learns that he's a part of an experimental government program that allows him to relive the final 8 minutes of a victim's life repeatedly, and is tasked to find the person responsible for the bombing.Ingeniously directed by Duncan Jones in what's only his sophomore effort, Source Code invites its viewers to take part & solve the mystery within the 8 minutes window again n again, and is another winning entry in the career of this promising talent. The plot structure is slightly perplexing but the intuitive manner in which Jones presents it to the audience allows them to invest in its premise and keeps them interested till the very end.Jake Gyllenhaal chips in with a highly compelling performance and single-handedly steers the film past the finish line. Michelle Monaghan & Vera Fermiga also contribute with fine supporting work but their characters aren't as well-defined as Gyllenhaal's. The film gains momentum early in the story and, thanks to its dynamic camera-work & skillful editing, keeps its moments tense & thrilling for the remainder of its runtime.On an overall scale, Source Code is an intelligently crafted brain-teaser that delivers a healthy dose of quality entertainment, remains intensely gripping throughout its runtime, and is a welcome example of its genre that's sharp, riveting & satisfying on more levels than one. The only glaring issue I have with it is that it steps over what would've been an ideal conclusion and chooses to finish on a hopeful note. Nevertheless, Source Code is a thrilling ride that refuses to slow down until it reaches its final destination, and comes definitely recommended.",Null,0,0,14 August 2016
Skyfall," Less Of A Random Killing Machine, More Of A Personal Statement.
","Breaking the continuity that carried over from Casino Royale to Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is a standalone feature which takes the series to an all-time high by becoming the most successful chapter of the long-running franchise and with its strong word-of-mouth reception also turns out to be the fitting instalment to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Bond series.The story of Skyfall presents the 007 agent at his most vulnerable after he's accidentally shot down by his own agent while on a mission. Retiring to a peaceful life once he's presumed dead, Bond ultimately returns to duty after an assassination attempt is made on M after which further investigations lead him to a former MI6 agent who seeks revenge against M for betraying him.Directed by Sam Mendes, the film begins on a rousing note with a spectacular chase sequence set in Istanbul, followed by an even more remarkable theme song by Adele, after which the main plot surfaces. The film delves into a much darker territory this time but at its core lies a very emotional tale that's elegantly handled by the revered filmmaker throughout its runtime.Coming to the technical aspects, Skyfall might very well be the most beautiful looking film of the franchise as almost every element is carefully processed & executed. Roger Deakins' spellbinding cinematography makes the film truly stand out & is at its most dazzling during the Shanghai sequences. Editing firmly controls its pacing and both set pieces & locations are smartly chosen.Use of CGI remains minimal with more emphasis given to stunt work & practical effects to keep the action sequences as grounded as possible. Continuing their successful collaboration since the beginning, Thomas Newman comes up with another terrific score that beautifully intertwines with Mendes' narrative while Adele's theme song might very well be the franchise's finest to date.Coming to the performances, Daniel Craig shows great comfort in getting under the skin of 007 this time but Skyfall boasts a really strong supporting cast this time amongst which Judi Dench & Javier Bardem end up impressing the most. Dench as M is upgraded to leading lady status as her character plays a significant role in the events plus her relationship with Bond is the film's core ingredient.Javier Bardem plays the main antagonist with finesse & even though the odd persona he portrays as Silva is very commendable, it isn't as intimidating as I expected it to be. Ralph Fiennes is always a treat to watch no matter what role he plays, Naomie Harris' character turns out to be the worst driver ever while both Ben Whishaw & Bérénice Marlohe are fine additions in their given roles of Q & Sévérine, respectively.On an overall scale, Skyfall is a welcome addition to James Bond franchise and although many like to call it the best Bond film to date, I would still put my money on Casino Royale. Realigning its route by advancing into the future without leaving behind the old-school charisma, Skyfall is a worthy follow-up that ultimately lives up to its hype &, despite its overlong third act, manages to deliver the thrills it promised.",Null,1,5,9 December 2014
Catch Me If You Can," The True Story of A Real Fake.
","Inspired from a true story, Catch Me If You Can is the biopic of Frank Abagnale Jr., a mastermind conman who succeeded in forging millions of dollars worth of checks while disguised as an airline pilot, doctor & lawyer, all before turning 19 years of age, and apart from capturing the methods employed by this young & brilliant con artist to get his job done also covers his stint with the FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, who eventually hunts him down.Although Steven Spielberg is yet to give a true cinematic masterpiece in the 21st century, Catch Me If You Can comes pretty close with nothing much to complain in any of the filmmaking departments and is one of his most enjoyable & entertaining films. The direction is dynamic, the script is lively, pacing is relentless with no dragging moment & music by John Williams suits the Spielberg's story just the way it always has in the past.Amongst the performances, Tom Hanks is seriously good as the FBI agent who is trying to track down our conman but is also fond of him. Christopher Walken chips in with another good work as Frank Abagnale Sr. & Amy Adams as Brenda Strong has an innocent presence too. But the one who impresses the most is Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenaged con artist, Frank Abagnale Jr., and delivers an energetic, confident & versatile performance.On an overall scale, Catch Me If You Can is a light-hearted work of quality entertainment that is smartly directed, smoothly paced, ingeniously performed, firmly edited & nicely scored but benefits most from DiCaprio's show-stealing performance under the assured direction of Spielberg, and is as charming as its lead character in spite of all its flaws.",Null,1,2,26 February 2014
The Hangover," Where Most Comedies Fail, The Hangover Succeeds.
","Freshly envisioned, skilfully directed & brilliantly performed, The Hangover is a roller-coaster ride of quality entertainment that simply ranks amongst the finest comedies to come out in the past decade for the film is full of hilarious moments, crazy characters & an engaging storyline that never goes dull for a moment.The Hangover tells the story of 4 friends who travel to Las Vegas to celebrate the bachelor party of one of their own only to wake up the next day with no memory of what happened the previous night & discover that the bachelor himself is missing. The plot follows their search as they try to find him before his impending marriage.Directed by Todd Phillips, The Hangover brims with freshness that's not easily found in the genre of comedy today and is crafted with deft elegance. Phillips' direction does complete justice to its quality screenplay & balances all aspects of storytelling from start to finish for there are enough genuinely funny moments that never feel forced & characters are finely refined as well.The Hangover also benefits from its dynamic camera-work & effective use of warm colour palette that captures Las Vegas in all its glory. Editing is one of its finest aspects for the story is briskly paced, trims out the unnecessary moments & keeps the entertainment going throughout its 100 minutes of runtime, and the soundtrack incorporates songs that simply fit its narrative.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms & Justin Bartha in the role of four friends, and all of them chip in with breakthrough performances with Zach being the highlight. However, what makes this film amazing isn't its characters but the interplay between them, and the chemistry between these actors goes a long way in making that part work in the film's favour.On an overall scale, The Hangover is a highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & endlessly fun cinema that's polished in all aspects of filmmaking, manages to retain its quality all the way & is a welcome addition to the genre of R-rated comedy. It's not without its shortcomings but the positives far outweighs the negatives while the charm of its cast brushes away the other complaints. And where most comedies fail, The Hangover simply succeeds.",Null,1,2,7 October 2013
Iron Man 3," A Welcome Improvement Over Its Predecessor!
","Marking the commencement of the second phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe after the first one culminated with The Avengers, Iron Man 3 presents a definite improvement over its insufferably boring predecessor but it still falls short of the magical experience that was the first Iron Man film. However, it does carry a new energy & has a refreshing vibe to it, thanks to the new director at helm.Iron Man 3 continues the story of Tony Stark who's recovering from post-traumatic stress caused by the events of The Avengers. Unable to sleep & genuinely afraid of losing what he loves, Stark's life is turned upside down after he issues a threat to a radical terrorist who retaliates by destroying his personal world, leaving him far more vulnerable than ever before & forcing him to rebuild from the scratch.Co-written & directed by Shane Black, Iron Man 3 really benefits from a fresh perspective & is an enjoyable ride for the most part but it is also marred by its attempt to try out way too many things at once, out of which only a few work out in a convincing manner. Technical aspects are finely executed for its Cinematography favours a slightly darker tone, Editing steadily paces its narrative while Brian Tyler's adds more vibrancy to it.Coming to the performances, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley & Rebecca Hall join the reprising cast & ably fill up their given roles while Robert Downey Jr. once again manages to impress the most. The best thing about this sequel is the position it puts Tony Stark in & Downey Jr. does a terrific job in bringing that vulnerability on the screen. Also, while I was a bit furious at what they did with Iron Man's arch-nemesis, I did later warm up to what their intent was here.On an overall scale, Iron Man 3 is a solid follow up to Iron Man & you don't even have to go through the crap that was Iron Man 2 to get to this one. The film's intent to cover the darker issues at hand while keeping itself light-hearted & plenty of fun is a combination that never gels so well, is at friction on many occasions & is bound to divide its viewers, but its improvement over everything that was so wrong with its predecessor nevertheless makes it a welcome chapter, if not a worthy one.",Null,1,3,28 March 2015
The Ring," Of All The Hollywood Remakes Of Japanese Horror, 'The Ring' Still Stands As The Best
","Of all the Hollywood remakes of Japanese horror features that have surfaced since the dawn of the new millennium, The Ring still stands as the best. Encapsulated with a sense of foreboding, making effective use of its ominous ambiance, and treading its material with patience, it's a dark, surreal & visually haunting omen that thrills as well as satisfies.The story of The Ring revolves around a videotape that is fabled to bear a jinx that kills its viewers after 7 days. The plot follows a journalist who conducts her own investigation when her niece & her three other friends die under mysterious circumstances, and ultimately stumbles upon the ill-fated video herself. With limited time on her hands, she tries to find a way to lift the curse.Directed by Gore Verbinski, The Ring is virtually a shot-for-shot remake of the original but its visual & sound design do give its images a distinctiveness of their own. Verbinski relies on the creepiness that sets in earlier in the story to keep the viewers around instead of going for conventional tricks like jump scares or gore. Also worthy of mention is his firm control over pacing & atmosphere.The whole film has a very wet, isolated look n feel that's further enhanced by its sunless ambiance & cold colour tones. Camera-work is silent yet brooding, shooting locations provide a spectral aura to the film, Editing is definitely a plus, for it allows the plot to unravel at its own pace and is able to retain its mystery till the end, while Hans Zimmer's muffled score silently amplifies the eerie mood.Coming to the performances, Naomi Watts carries the entire picture with a commendable input but she could've done better if more depth was provided to her character. Martin Henderson is almost flat in his part while the kid himself looks creepier than the antagonist. The most noteworthy of all are the contents of the cursed videotape, reeking with such surreal & disturbing images that it has a mystical power of its own.On an overall scale, The Ring is one of the rare remakes that are just as compelling as the original, if not more, and is one of the better examples of atmospheric horror done right. Enveloped with a chilling layer of dread, it is an unnerving & unsettling feature that tackles its tale with restraint and revels in the tension that originates from its sinister iconography. A welcome respite from mindless gore & cheap thrills, The Ring is definitely worth a shot.",Null,4,4,30 June 2017
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One Of The Greatest Adventure Films Of All Time.
","Although Steven Spielberg's Jaws gets the distinction of being the very first blockbuster in cinema history, the blueprint of modern blockbuster filmmaking was brought to life by none other than Spielberg's early 1980s action-adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, which didn't just become one of the greatest examples of its genre but even today remains one of the most enjoyable & entertaining works of this esteemed director's illustrious career.Set in the year of 1936, Raiders of the Lost Ark concerns an archaeologist & adventurer named Indiana Jones who is hired by the US government to find the Ark of the Covenant after learning that the Führer is after the same biblical artifact which, according to him, would make his army an invincible force. Indiana's job is to find the artifact before the Nazis get their hand on it but between him & the ark stand his old foe & bands of Nazis.Opening with an explosive sequence that introduces us to our protagonist & also sets the tone for the rest of the picture, Steven Spielberg's kinetic direction provides a zestful energy to the whole plot & it never really settles down until the end credits start rolling. The pacing is fierce, the action is non-stop, the VFX look slightly dated but doesn't take away much from the film & I have nothing but praise for its superb use of humour.Coming to the acting department, the performances by every cast member is pretty good but it's Harrison Ford who ends up stealing the show as his stylish, charismatic & brilliant rendition of Indiana Jones turned this character into one of cinema's most iconic figures. Cinematography also deserves applause for its dynamic energy while John Williams' score is full of adventurous tracks that keeps it fresh throughout the runtime.On an overall scale, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a wildly entertaining & ridiculously fun action- adventure which with its amazing set pieces, relentless pace, sly humour, superb visual effects, terrific music & excellent performances delivers a cinema that ingeniously balances its filmmaking aspects on the quality vs quantity graph. Offering a joyous & incredibly satisfying cinematic ride, Raiders of the Lost Ark defines the way blockbusters should be made.",Null,0,1,14 October 2013
Spartacus," More Titanic Than Any Story Ever Told
","One of its tagline says, 'More titanic than any story ever told!' which actually isn't very far from the truth & also notorious for being the only feature in the legendary film career of director Stanley Kubrick on which he didn't have complete artistic control, Spartacus is breathtaking in both scope of its ambition & scale of its production, and just like every other Kubrick film, is an influential example of its genre.Based on Howard Fast's novel of the same name & set in 1st century BC, Spartacus tells the true life story of its titular character; a rebellious slave being trained at a gladiatorial school, who begins an uprising which soon spreads across the Italian Peninsula, resulting in the freedom of thousands of slaves but when his plan to flee the country is disrupted, he decides to challenge the might of Roman Empire.Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film has all the trademarks of this auteur yet feels remarkably different & unique compared to his previous works. The film is the first big-budget production of his career & yet the manner in which the then-young Kubrick handles its huge cast & epic scope is a testament to his skills as a filmmaker. Written by Dalton Trumbo, the screenplay isn't very accurate to its historical facts but it does make the story more relatable with current events.The technical aspects are always gold-standard in Kubrick films & Spartacus is no exception. The set pieces are amazing to look at, locations are elegantly chosen, Cinematography makes fab use of its camera, the panoramic shots are spectacular, colour composition is vibrant & the level of detail is quite extensive. Despite running over 3 hours, it kept me deeply invested in its story & Alex North's majestic score provides an epic feel to its narrative.Coming to the performances, Spartacus features a star-studded cast in Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, Tony Curtis & others. Douglas gives his all in the role of Spartacus & delivers a fantastic performance, Olivier plays Crassus with fine elegance, Laughton as Gracchus ends up stealing every scene he's in, Gavin doesn't do much as Julius Caesar, Curtis is brilliant as Antoninas & Jean Simmons does a good job as Varinia in a film dominated by men.On an overall scale, to know that the screen being filled with thousands of people doesn't have one pixel of CGI in it, to know that each one of those extras was a real person indeed & to know that Kubrick managed to churn out an epic that more than lives up to its word are amongst a few things that makes me admire Spartacus all the more. Grandeur in scale, highly entertaining, very engaging, and covering love, betrayal, corruption, slavery, mutiny, civilization & leadership with finesse, Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus comes strongly recommended.",Null,0,3,8 January 2015
Deepwater Horizon," Brings The Real-Life Disaster To Cinematic Life In A Direct, Serious & No-Nonsense Fashion
","Deepwater Horizon approaches its real-life subject matter like a deep breath before the plunge, exhibits a sense of apprehension from its opening moments, and provides an incredibly intense, thoroughly unrelenting & ruthlessly aggressive cinematic experience once things go south.Based on the man-made disaster that took place on the titular oil drilling rig back in 2010 and was responsible for the worst oil spill in US history, Deepwater Horizon provides a dramatised account of the event, what ultimately caused it, and the measures that were taken to save & evacuate the numerous lives on board.Directed by Peter Berg, the movie moves to the site of disaster real quick once the characters are introduced and from that point onwards, it steadily keeps ratcheting up the tension which then ultimately explodes on screen in a spectacular fashion. Berg directs the segments without holding anything back and keeps things engaging at all times.Further elevating the experience is the way Berg shoots those moments of carnage. The explosion, the destruction, the suddenness of it all is vibrantly photographed & masterly edited while sound design is top-notch & effectively utilised and works in tandem with its silently brewing score. CGI isn't overblown and only assists in magnifying the elements of the disaster as it unfolds.Coming to the acting department, Deepwater Horizon features a fine cast in Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Gina Rodriguez, Kate Hudson & others but only Wahlberg & Russell are able to stand out. Wahlberg plays the central character with sincerity and is brilliantly supported by Russell who chips in with a strong performance of his own. The rest play their part competently.On an overall scale, Deepwater Horizon may not feature taut screenplay or memorable characters but it sure packs a powerful punch that leaves a mark when it finally lands. Add to that, the story depicts the real-life incident without diluting it with poor dialogues or excess melodrama that many examples of its genre are guilty of, and instead opts for a serious, direct & no-nonsense approach in bringing it to cinematic life. Definitely worth a shot.",Null,0,1,8 September 2017
United 93," In Memory of Those Who Lost Their Lives on September 11, 2001...
","Almost everyone has an idea of how this film is gonna end but what director Paul Greengrass has done in between the opening & closing credits here is what makes United 93 a truly devastating & unforgettable cinematic experience. Featuring an unknown cast of actors to make the drama more plausible & to provide it with a documentary feel, the film is crafted with great eye for detail & recounts the horror event that shook the entire world with unflinching accuracy.United 93 is the story about the 4th hijacked plane on the doomed September 11 morning which was the only flight that failed to reach its intended target. After collecting detailed accounts from the victims' families, the cast & crew here try to recreate the entire event when passengers on-board this jinxed airplane put up a fight for not only their lives but for thousands of others who wouldn't be alive today if the hijackers had managed to make it to their target.On an overall scale, Paul Greengrass' United 93 can be argued for trying to cash in on a sensitive subject matter that's still fresh in the minds of people who lived to witness that tragic day but what's absolutely heartwarming to see here is that Greengrass has treated its delicate content with utmost respect and the whole film is an unflinching, gut-wrenching, emotionally traumatic & moving cinema dedicated in memory of everyone who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. Is A Magical Experience That Appeals Equally To Viewers Of All Ages.
","With innocence at its heart & sheer magic on its surface, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is one of the most adored & beloved films of all time which with its emotionally stirring narration, stunning portrait of childhood & exquisite depiction of the beauty of friendship ends up being a truly magical & spellbinding experience that still appeals to viewers of all ages.It tells the story of an alien left behind on the planet by its peers when they take off in a hurry due to human interference. All alone on Earth by himself, E.T. eventually finds shelter in Elliot's home in whom he also finds an emotional companion & friend. What follows next is E.T.'s more acquaintance with Elliot's siblings, his adventures in the house & his deep desire to return home while he is being hunted by intelligence officials.Steven Spielberg's direction here weaves the plot with remarkable balance as he effortlessly succeeds in providing great emotional depth to all characters, including E.T., while also portraying childhood & its simplicity in a very charming manner. Cinematography captures the world from a child's point of view. Editing is elegantly carried out. And the visual effects are state-of-the-art stuff just like they are in every film by Spielberg.The performances by the cast is as innocent as childhood itself & shows great bonding all around. From child actors like Henry Thomas & Drew Barrymore to Dee Wallace & others, everyone does an impressive job in their given roles & their emotional performances are highly convincing. Even E.T. managed to express itself pretty well and is destined to make viewers smile, laugh & cry with him.Also, a special mention about the exceptional score by John Williams. The soundtrack presents the most perfect collaboration between Spielberg & Williams so far that in my opinion is Williams' finest composition. The contribution its score single-handedly made to this film is huge & an achievement in itself as it took the emotions of this film to a whole new level and is at its very best during the final moments.Featuring brilliant direction, mesmerizing narration, classic editing, innocent performances, lovely cinematography & great visuals, E.T. is magic in movie-making that presents Spielberg at his absolute best and succeeds not only as one of the most exciting sci-fi adventures of its or any other time but also as one of the greatest films ever made.On an overall scale, Covering themes of abandonment, childhood, innocence, friendship, loss & separation, E.T.

Casablanca," As Time Goes By... Casablanca Refuses To Age.
","A couple of years ago, romance used to be my least favoured genre for every film I'd seen until then had a predictable storyline, over-the-top melodrama, the same repeated idea of love & nothing much happened in them plot-wise throughout the runtime. The exceptions were too few but they were so because of reasons which had nothing to do with romance.Not much has changed in the past two years but having come across some extraordinary films in that time, including 2013 releases like Richard Linklater's Before Midnight, Spike Jonze's Her & the Palme d'Or winner Blue Is the Warmest Color which made me see this genre with an entirely new perspective, I do have a new-found respect & appreciation for romantic movies.Now Casablanca is a defined, engraved & universally embraced masterpiece. In my opinion, it too has a predictable storyline & some melodrama but then, it also has something that typical examples of its genre lack... and that's quality. Whether it's direction, writing, score, camera-work, cast, performances or narration, Casablanca writes a new chapter in each one of these departments.Set in the titular city during World War II, the story of Casablanca concerns an American expatriate & former freedom fighter who now runs the most popular nightclub & gambling den in the city. Things are set in motion when his old flame arrives in town with her husband who's a renowned Czech Resistance leader wanted by the Nazi & asks for his help but he's got plans of his own.Directed by Michael Curtiz, this one film engraved his name in the annals of cinema for it is expertly crafted from start to finish, is filled with memorable lines, introduces its characters wonderfully, is crisply photographed in black n white which provides a timeless sense to the story, is steadily paced throughout its 102 minutes of runtime & features a heartwarming, mesmerising & evocative score.Coming to the performances, Casablanca has a pretty huge supporting cast but it's the top-billing of Humphrey Bogart & Ingrid Bergman who deliver the film's strongest performances. Bogart plays his role with effortless charm & has an infectious screen presence while the ever so beautiful Bergman leaves a lasting impression with a sensational work that's also the most memorable & finest work of her career.On an overall scale, over 70 years have passed since this love story made its debut on the silver screen & yet, Casablanca has neither found an equal nor aged a day. Just like a good old wine, this timeless classic is only getting better & more profound as time goes by, continues to inspire & influence various works of romance even today, and it looks like it is going to remain a benchmark for its genre for a foreseeable future, if not eternity.",Null,1,2,14 September 2013
Minority Report," One Of The Most Intelligent Sci-Fi Thrillers Ever Made.
","Definitely amongst the most intelligent sci-fi thrillers to surface on the silver screen, Minority Report is an ingeniously envisioned, smartly crafted & cleverly narrated cinema from Steven Spielberg that presents the director in prime form, paints an endlessly fascinating portrait of the future & remains one of the most creative works of Spielberg's filmmaking career.Set in Washington D.C. in the year 2054 where crime has been entirely eradicated thanks to an advanced system that's able to pre-determine any criminal activity, allowing the cops to arrest the perpetrators before they commit their crimes, Minority Report follows the Special Police Force's chief who one day finds himself accused of a future murder & tries to prevent it from happening.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film doesn't wallow in explaining how everything works in the future but simply gets on with its main plot within few minutes into the story. Spielberg's execution deserves kudos for he does a terrific job in narrating its complicated plot & keeps everyone firmly glued to their seats from start to finish while the screenplay is a masterwork of imagination in itself.Art Direction puts up some extensively detailed sets on the screen, the sci-fi elements that are infused into the story carry a thought-provoking, well-researched & plausible dimension, Cinematography encapsulates the film with a neo-noirish ambiance, thanks to its splendid use of desaturated colours, high contrasts n lighting. Editing relentlessly paces the whole narrative & John Williams' score is fitting.Coming to the performances, Minority Report features a pretty reliable cast in Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton & Max von Sydow and everyone is very convincing in their given roles. The action sequences are an absolute delight to look at, Visual Effects is state- of-the-art stuff as in every Spielberg film and even though it enhances the experience by a great deal, it never overshadows the story at hand.On an overall scale, Minority Report is a bravura piece of work from Steven Spielberg that digs way too deeper than most sci-fi flicks dare to, has been influential in the creation of a few technologies in existence today, and on a thematic level is as rich as Blade Runner. Its deeper layers may unearth on multiple viewings but even for those who aren't in mood for excavation, Minority Report simply happens to be an extremely gripping, wildly entertaining & thoroughly satisfying experience. Highly recommended.",Null,1,2,14 October 2013
Finding Neverland," An Endearing Tale Told In An Elegant Manner
","An elegantly crafted tale told with utmost sincerity, Finding Neverland is a heartfelt blend of the endless imagination, warmth & exuberant joy of childhood with soul-crushing hardships of real life that benefits a lot from the endearing performances its cast is able to chip in but lacks the wow factor that elevates any film from a 'good one' to a 'great one'.Finding Neverland is a semi-autobiographical account of the Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie who's best known for creating the character of Peter Pan. The film focuses on his friendship with the Davies family and the time he spent with the Davies' kids from which he drew the inspiration for his next play, which would eventually go on to become a children classic.Directed by Marc Forster, Finding Neverland skilfully incorporates the elements of fantasy into its simple-structured plot and has a very calm, serene-like vibe to it. Everything is in tune to make it a poignant experience for the viewers but it's the performances by Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet that contribute the most to that particular aspect and both of them are nicely supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, Finding Neverland is an intimate, touching piece of graceful storytelling which sometimes heads deeper into its melodrama than required but keeps the majority of its acts balanced to deliver a pleasantly satisfying experience. There isn't much wrong with its content but what it has in store for its viewers isn't something that stays around once its story is over. Although it gets less rewarding on every subsequent viewing, Finding Neverland is still worth a shot.",Null,0,0,15 November 2015
Lifeboat," In Spite of So Many Constraints, Hitchcock Crafts A Highly Effective Thriller.
","Shot entirely on a single location, Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat is his first film to employ the minimal settings environment which he used to greater effect in his later career & despite the many constraints of framing so many characters within such limited space, this master director triumphs in creating an effective thriller that even today remains one of his most underrated works.With its entire plot unfolding on a lifeboat during World War II, Lifeboat concerns a group of survivors left stranded on a lifeboat after their ship & a German U-boat sunk each other in combat. Trouble starts brewing when they pull a man from the water who turns out to be from the U-boat. And so begins the clash of opinions between the rest of boat members as they discuss about what to do with him.The direction by Hitchcock is brilliant for the manner in which he's able to assign the required screen time to each member on the boat & handles the suspense element beautifully from start to finish. The scripted characters have a complex & morally ambiguous dimension which adds a sense of unpredictability to the entire plot. The camera-work is a gem considering the limited options it had & yet each moment feels crisply captured.The performances by the cast is no slouch either & everyone portrayed their descending arcs rather well. Also, the music is virtually absent from the entire film but thanks to its cleverly structured narration, there never felt the need for any. On an overall scale, Lifeboat may not be amongst Hitchcock's famous works but it sure was a stepping stone towards his experiments with film narration which he went on to explore remarkably well in his future films.",Null,0,0,5 October 2013
Detroit," Another Solid Effort From The Creators Of 'The Hurt Locker' & 'Zero Dark Thirty'
","From the creators of The Hurt Locker & Zero Dark Thirty comes another sharp-edged thriller that's brutal, violent & unsettling from start to finish. Encapsulated with a volatile atmosphere, unfolding with raw intensity & overflowing with charged emotions, Detroit takes hold of the viewers attention within its first few minutes and doesn't let go until the very end.Based on the infamous Algiers Motel incident that took place during the 1967 riots in Detroit, the film re-enacts the fateful night that saw a group of police officers stepping out of their line of duty when they responded to an earlier complaint with retribution rather than justice on their minds and went further than just beating up the nine residents that they rounded up.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Detroit finds the esteemed filmmaker employing all her trademarks to capture the chaotic aura of the story's provocative content, and she manages to keeps things tight & tense at all times. The drama is gripping throughout and doesn't dial down on violence while the grim mood is further amplified by its frenzied camera-work & slick editing.The Algiers Motel setting is finely detailed and the entire riotous ambiance is effectively recreated. The performances are no slouch as every cast member contributes with an emotionally compelling input and play their part as per the scene requirements. The strongest act comes from Will Poulter who sells his racist cop character so aggressively that it overshadows the other actors' inputs.On an overall scale, Detroit is a nail-biting dramatization of a historical tragedy that may not be as accomplished as Bigelow's previous two directorial efforts but it is a sturdily crafted period piece that shares much similarity with the current climate of racism in America and shows that not much has changed in the last 50 years. Brought to life with cut-throat fierceness & further strengthened by solid performances from its cast, Detroit comes thoroughly recommended.",Null,1,7,29 November 2017
In Bruges," Watch First. Thank Me Later.
","A swiftly paced, endlessly entertaining & downright hilarious tale about tragedy, guilt, friendship & principles, all pierced with one witty line after another, Martin McDonagh's feature film debut is an expertly directed, cleverly scripted & splendidly performed black comedy that not only ranks amongst the best films of its year but is also one of the most accomplished works of its genre.Set in the medieval city of Bruges, Belgium, In Bruges tells the story of two London-based hit men who are asked to lie low in Bruges for a while & await further instructions from their employer after their latest hit goes horribly wrong. The city affects both of them as one is completely enamoured by its culture while the other absolutely detests it but things change when next instructions finally arrive.Written & directed by Martin McDonagh, In Bruges brims with a fresh, invigorating energy and is highly gripping from start to finish. McDonagh's work behind the camera is no doubt impressive but the screenplay he penned down is even better. Packed with sharp humour & memorable one- liners, the scripted tale retains its lighthearted tone even in serious moments and is just as funny as it is thrilling.Shot in exotic locations, the city of Bruges comes alive in vivid detail and while the film captures its old-fashioned vibe & way of living in an evocative manner, it also doesn't shy away from poking fun of the same from time to time. Cinematography infuses the tale with neo-noir elements, the pacing is smooth & steady, there isn't one dull scene in the final print, and Carter Burwell's score fits the premise beautifully.Coming to the performances, In Bruges features a talented cast in Collin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson & Ralph Fiennes, along with a couple more, and since their respective characters already exhibit an interesting arc, the actors are able to build their work on a solid platform. The chemistry between Farrell & Gleeson is delightful but Fiennes isn't far behind either & steals pretty much every scene in the supporting role of Harry, their employer.On an overall scale, In Bruges is a thoroughly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying crime-drama that scores high marks in all departments of filmmaking and is further boosted by its pitch black humour & committed performances. A surprisingly effective marriage of comedy, crime & drama that has the ability to evoke rib-tickling laughter from its audience in the most unexpected ways, In Bruges is an instant classic that's every bit worthy of its cult status.

John Wick," Welcome Back, Mr. Reeves! Welcome Back!
","Absolutely remorseless, purely unadulterated & downright violent from start to finish, John Wick is possibly the most stylishly crafted, feverishly paced, seamlessly executed, intensely entertaining & immensely satisfying action flick to come out from Hollywood after a very long time which, apart from marking a welcome return to action for Keanu Reeves, also triumphs as one of the biggest cinematic surprises of the year, not to mention the coolest by far.Very refined in its visual presentation, taking a no-holds-barred approach with its content & providing heavy doses of pulse-pounding entertainment that many viewers will want to revisit again n again, John Wick is amongst the most impressive looking motion pictures of the year that takes its simple premise to an unexpected high, thanks to its kinetic direction, breathtaking action, neat cinematography, slick editing & a magnificent lead performance from Keanu Reeves.The film tells the story of its titular character who used to be an ultimate assassin but retired to take care of his dying wife. Losing her to cancer, he receives a posthumous gift from her in the form of a puppy, with whom he eventually connects. Things are set in motion when few Russian thugs invade his home to steal his car but also end up beating him & killing his dog. And so the ex-hit-man comes out of his retirement to unleash carnage on the gangsters who took everything away from him.Produced & directed by the first time filmmakers in Chad Stahelski & David Leitch, who until now had worked in the film industry as stunt coordinators, John Wick marks a stunning directional debut for both of them & is a spectacular start to their filmmaking careers. And Derek Kolstad's screenplay doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise or introducing its characters & gets right down on business from the start by telling just enough about Wick to get the plot moving.Technically, there is a lot to admire about John Wick as the film exhibits an otherworldly setting for a revenge thriller that makes minimal use of elements not relevant to the plot. Camera-work makes its mark in the close-combat sequences for it provides a clear view of the carnage & isn't ruined by excessive editing or shaky cam. Editing paces the story with vicious velocity while its cool soundtrack further enhances the experience by remaining in tone with the film's events.Coming to the performances, the film features a capable cast in Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo & others, amongst which both Reeves & Dafoe end up impressing the most. With a character that's tailor-made for his talent & combined with his magnetic screen presence, Reeves delivers a swashbuckling performance & easily steals the show. Dafoe follows him close & despite his short role, manages to leave his mark.Yet the best thing about John Wick remains its action sequences that are stupendously carried out. With its debutant directors already well-versed in the field of action choreography & stunt work, the two manage to add new freshness to the combat sequences by nicely blending its gunplay with grounded martial arts to single-handedly elevate John Wick into the league of cinema's finest action entertainers to come out in recent years.On an overall scale, John Wick is a smart, sophisticated & incredibly well-polished cinema that nicely balances its high-octane action & finely enacted drama to succeed as a potent, kinetic & relentless entertainer. Helmed by two new directors who understand what great action is about, boasting a script that knows where to draw the line & spearheaded by Keanu Reeves' badass performance, John Wick is an instant classic that comes as a must for every action film fanatic out there.Welcome back, Mr. Reeves!

Kung Fu Panda," DreamWorks Animation's Funniest Film To Date!
","One of the finest films to come out of DreamWorks Animation's canon and certainly their funniest film to date, Kung Fu Panda is an energetic blend of kinetic direction, smart writing, sparkling wit, vibrant camera-work, tight editing, first-rate animation & exuberant score that not only works as a downright hilarious comedy but also as a thrilling action extravaganza & a fascinating coming-of- age story.Set in ancient China, which is populated by anthropomorphic talking animals, the story of Kung Fu Panda follows a cheeky, clumsy & squishy giant panda named Po who aspires of becoming a kung fu master. His wish is granted when he's unexpectedly proclaimed as Dragon Warrior who will fulfil an ancient prophecy, but finds himself to be the subject of ridicule by the other kung fu disciples & their mentor until an old enemy returns.Co-directed by John Stevenson & Mark Osborne, Kung Fu Panda brims with a sense of immediacy without ever sacrificing its drama or characters for mere amusement. The story is set up relatively quick, characters & their roles are instantly identifiable, and although it is a rip-roaringly hilarious ride from start to finish, it's also surprisingly heavy in the drama section. Also assisting the story is the medium of animation that gives the filmmakers a huge canvas to realise their imagination on.Every character exhibits a full-fledged arc in this story, the filmmakers have done a fabulous job in drawing out moments of laughter from even the most unexpected moments, the lighthearted vibe is effectively maintained throughout its runtime, the plot is relentlessly paced, and the background score by Hans Zimmer & John Powell infuses an energy of its own into the narrative while the animation makes fab use of available colour palette to put on screen a richly coloured world and it all simply works out.The film also boasts a star-studded voice cast in Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, David Cross & others, and nearly all of them suit the characters they lend their voices to. The character of Po is voiced by Jack Black and the actor does an excellent job at it for he imparts not only his vocals but a few other attributes as well. Hoffman voices Po's mentor and their teacher-disciple chemistry is this story's driving force. McShane voices the antagonist & is able to give him an intimidating quality while the rest of the cast do well in their supporting roles.On an overall scale, Kung Fu Panda is definitely a fresh breathe of life from DreamWorks Animation and is one of their most enjoyable, entertaining & amusing efforts that knows where it is headed & what it is doing. Scoring high marks in nearly all departments of filmmaking, delivering its message in an easily accessible manner, exquisitely balancing its elements of comedy, drama & action, plus effortlessly sustaining its downright hysterical wit at all times, Kung Fu Panda is amongst the best films of its year and remains a thrilling extravaganza for viewers of all ages. Highly recommended.",Null,1,1,8 April 2016
Chinatown," A Film That I Admire But Don't Love!
","A classic example of its genre(s) that packs in a taut screenplay which is transitioned on the film canvas in a seamless manner by a skilled filmmaker in complete control of his craft and is further bolstered by strong performances from its entire cast, Chinatown is considered by many to be one of the best offerings in the mystery genre and it is indeed difficult to dispute its legacy.Inspired from true events, the story of Chinatown is set in Los Angeles and follows a private detective specialising in matrimonial cases who's hired by a woman to investigate & confirm her suspicion of her husband having an affair but soon finds himself caught in a bigger web when the client turns out to be an impersonator. As he digs deeper into the case to find out who set him up, he uncovers a plot involving deceit, corruption & murder.Directed by Roman Polanski (best known for Rosemary's Baby & The Pianist), Chinatown is expertly crafted with thorough attention given to its setting & timeline, and the story unfolds in a controlled manner. Robert Town's script is a highlight too that's completely focused on its lead character without discarding the secondary ones. The technical aspects are skilfully carried out while Jerry Goldsmith's score is beautiful, poignant & haunting at the same time.The cast comprises of Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Hillerman & others, with all of them turning in a committed performance in their given roles. Nicholson is excellent as the private investigator, plays his character with finesse, and is present in virtually every single scene. Dunaway also puts up a strong show that goes neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the film is at its best when the screen is shared by Nicholson & Dunaway for their spot- on chemistry just works.On an overall scale, Chinatown doesn't seem to do much wrong with its narrative over the course of its runtime and yet I have no clue to why it didn't work out for me. Polanski's no- nonsense direction, Towne's polished screenplay & Nicholson's brilliant work are no doubt admirable but the whole experience of sitting through it was pretty stale, even in moments of big reveal including the soul-shattering climax. One of those films that I admire but feel no love for it, Chinatown is still full of surprises for newcomers and is highly recommended.",Null,2,4,9 September 2013
Rocketman," Worth The Price Of Admission For Taron Egerton's Lifelike Performance Alone
","Playing more like a fantasy-musical than a straightforward biopic, Rocketman brings the colourful life & persona of Elton John to silver screen in a vivid, vibrant fashion, and is championed by a star-making performance from Taron Egerton. But despite that, I don't really feel much love for it, and found it to be a rather okay biopic.The film chronicles the highs & lows of the famous musician's life, starting with his arrival at a rehabilitation session and then recounting his life in flashbacks. The plot covers his troubled childhood, his breakthrough years & meteoric rise in the music industry, followed by his struggle with addiction, thus bringing the journey full circle.Directed by Dexter Fletcher, his musical storytelling is going to be a hit or miss with many and unfortunately for me, it's the latter. Fletcher's decision to tell Elton John's life story with a bit of theatricality & fantasia goes well with the notable artist's own flamboyant stage shows but the narrative flow isn't smooth and it fails to strike the right emotional chord.The switch from drama to musical numbers is often jarring, and more could've been done to streamline this aspect. Pacing is also slightly on the slower side, especially in the second half. Nevertheless, the rich camerawork, melodic songs & impeccable costume design do provide it the required facelift, plus fans of the artist will enjoy & appreciate this wild ride.The real show-stealer, however, is Taron Egerton who treads the fine line between impersonation & reinvention to embody Elton John from inside out. And unlike last year's Best Actor Oscar winner, he is actually singing the artist's songs. This is no doubt Egerton's career-best performance, and he is brilliantly supported by Jamie Bell & Bryce Dallas Howard.On an overall scale, Rocketman captures the highs & lows of Elton John's life with finesse, features a standout performance from Taron Egerton that overshadows all other aspects, and will manage to please most viewers, if not all. I never dived into his discography so I'm not part of the chorus yet, but the film as a whole still didn't do enough to garner my interest & keep me captivated.",Null,1,1,11 August 2019

Gravity," 3D or Not... Either Way Gravity Is Going To Be One Hell of An Experience.
","Surpassing all hype & expectations with finesse, exhibiting excellence in nearly all aspects of filmmaking & making exceptional use of its third dimension, Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity is a cinematic spacewalk of jaw-dropping beauty, wonder & amazement that not only succeeds as one of the best films of its year but is a marvel of technical filmmaking that pushes the cinematic art form to new realms while also marking a huge leap for VFX in cinema.Set in space, Gravity tells the story of mission specialist Ryan Stone aboard a NASA space shuttle on her very first assignment which is being supervised by a veteran astronaut out on his final mission. Disaster strikes when the high-speed debris of a defunct satellite destroys their spaceship, thus leaving the two stranded in space with nothing but each other. Rest of the story focuses on Stone's journey as she finds hope & will to survive in the face of imminent death.Co-written & directed by Alfonso Cuarón, Gravity presents the notable filmmaker at the very peak of his so-far-illustrious career for he's taken a simple setting of a catastrophe, applied it in space, refined it with precision detailing & accurate science, intertwined each aspect with liberal arts and finally encapsulated the whole picture with the third dimension to provide a breathtaking experience of sheer awe & astonishment while the core content also deals with the themes of loss, isolation, resilience, mortality & rebirth in a concise manner.Coming to the technical aspects, Gravity is a triumph in every department. Starting with Cinematography, Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work introduces some new inventions in 3D photography and employs the long, continuous & unbroken single takes with sublime effectiveness to immerse the viewers into its world. And with the help of its fluid movements & contrasting shots, which seamlessly blends the warm imagery of Earth with bleakness of the rest of space, also does a fab job in narrating the plot visually.Editing trims the whole narrative down to 90 minutes which is expertly paced although there are a few moments in the middle when it feels like hitting a snag but that's only for a short duration & doesn't really hurt the whole experience. The silence of outer space does serve as accurate science to a considerable extent but it never stopped Steven Price to come up with a spectacular score that ultimately turned this already effective thriller into an absolute nightmare of escalating terror with its loud, intense & unsparing tracks.Apart from its two actors, almost everything in this film is computer-generated and yet the crisp images retain such high degree of realism with its authentic depiction of zero gravity, spacewalks, explosions along with geographic view of Earth, solar reflections & many other elements that it further signifies the careful attention with which the whole production was carried out and on an overall scale marks a huge step for VFX in cinema. Add to that, even the Sound aspect is nicely taken care of & exists only where it needs to.As far as performances go, there are only two characters we interact with in this narrative, actually one for the majority of its runtime. Now I'm not a fan of Sandra Bullock yet here I was quite enamoured by her vulnerable character who goes through plethora of emotions ranging from fear, frustration & hopelessness to rediscovered resilience, willingness to live & eventual spiritual reincarnation. Supporting her briefly is George Clooney in a tailor-made role that also provided little comic relief in what is an unforgiving & harrowing depiction of life in vacuum.Throughout its runtime, Gravity also pays tribute to a number of space classics, including Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Ridley Scott's Alien, Ron Howard's Apollo 13 & surprisingly Pixar's WALLE as well. Although it is heavily influenced from many disaster films of the past, the very experience it provides, especially in 3D, is unlike anything put on screen before. The third dimension really adds a great amount of depth to its premise while amplifying the rest of the elements, thus turning it into something that feels all the more special & personal.On an overall scale, Gravity is a fascinating blend of cinematic art & big-screen spectacle that qualifies as the finest film of its year, is the closest we've come to experiencing outer space on silver screen, and is an incredibly riveting thriller that's totally worth your time & money. Outstandingly directed, finely written, brilliantly performed, cleverly edited, briskly paced, gorgeously photographed, magnificently scored & skilfully balancing all its elements from start to finish, Gravity is as rewarding an experience emotionally as it is viscerally, is deserving of all the praise it has garnered to date & is a must-watch on the biggest screen possible.",Null,3,7,14 October 2013
Lone Survivor," A Mere Propaganda Film. Nothing More. Nothing Less.
","Based on the nonfiction book of the same name & set during the War in Afghanistan, Lone Survivor tries to recreate the US Navy SEALs' Operation Red Wings, a failed mission in which a survey team of 4 soldiers were tasked to locate the Taliban leader, Ahmad Shah. And even though it impresses in parts & has a lot in it to evoke the patriotic response from its target audience (which is American viewers obviously), Lone Survivor ends up going completely overboard in dramatizing the true events & suffers from the very clichés that most films of its genre find themselves trapped in.What's right with this film is Peter Berg's dynamic direction, tense atmosphere, superb pacing, intense battle sequences, precision use of sound, music & relatively fine performances from its star cast who were actually capable of delivering more than what ended up being in the final print. What's wrong with it, however, is its lack of emotional depth or character development, sometimes going overly dramatic than required and too much reliance on action to push its story forward which ultimately crosses the fine line between exploration & exploitation to revel in the latter.On an overall scale, Lone Survivor has nothing new to offer compared to what other films of this genre have already given us so far. Yes, it's brutal. Yes, it looks realistic to some extent. Yes, the battle sequences are disturbing, graphic &, in my opinion, explosively entertaining as well. But, there is also no denying that its characters remain hollow throughout its runtime, the story or characters aren't explored enough for us to invest our emotions in & all in all, this war drama is nothing less or more than a mere propaganda film, unfortunately.",Null,72,145,15 January 2014
To Be or Not to Be," As Smart A Comedy As It Is Stinging As A Satire
","As smart a comedy as it is stinging as a satire, To Be or Not to Be makes a mockery of the Nazi threat with its sharp writing & slick direction, and keeps alive the viewers' interest with its expertly timed wit & cleverly placed twists to succeed as a thrilling & amusing black comedy that has comfortably stood the test of time over the years.Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, the narrative treads a complex route yet is able to retain its balance for the most part and only gets better as plot progresses. It isn't an easy premise to pull off but Lubitsch knows when & where to dial back, and directs it with gusto. And equally impressive is the clever script, deftly juggling hilarity with solemn drama.Further assisting the picture is the focused camerawork & intelligent editing but the best contribution comes from the excellent performances from its brilliant ensemble who make the story gripping and characters worth investing into. Carole Lombard & Jack Benny shine in their roles, playing their part with flair, and are finely supported by the rest of the cast.Overall, To Be or Not to Be has aged beautifully and is amongst the better examples of its genre. Often steps away from jumping into the realm of excessive farce & total absurdity, this black comedy knows what lines to not cross and is brought to life with charm & elegance. As delightfully captivating as it is deliriously funny, Lubitsch's film is definitely worthy of your time & money.",Null,0,0,13 May 2020
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Monty Python's Magnum Opus
","Almost every cinema lover has his/her Christmas favourite that he/she likes to revisit on an annual basis as if it's part of a tradition. Preferred choice for most is Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life, for some it's John McTiernan's Die Hard & for few it's Chris Columbus' Home Alone but the one I keep revisiting on this auspicious day is Monty Python's Life of Brian.One of the funniest, silliest & craziest films of all time, Life of Brian is slapstick & satirical humour at its finest, zaniest & sharpest. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen, a Jewish man born on the same day & next door to Jesus Christ, who spends his life being mistaken for a prophet & becomes a reluctant Messiah after joining an anti-Roman political organization.Directed by Terry Jones, the film opens with what could very well be the most hysterical opening credit song in cinema history & certainly the one with most common-sense making lyrics. This is Monty Python's best work to date in my opinion, even better than Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and to finish it with an uplifting song that's all about our lives is an instant classic moment.Hilarious from start to finish, it rarely lets you breathe for it hordes the screen with one crazy moment after another. Some of the things might look little dated or not feel that funny anymore but its satirical take on religious attitudes, and not religion, is what makes it all the more amazing. The cast is awesome, writing is clever & the number of memorable moments are way too many to count.On an overall scale, Monty Python's Life of Brian is another cinematic gold from this classic comedy troupe & is without a doubt one of the greatest comedy films of all time. It has been 35 years since it first surfaced on the film screen & yet it retains all of its potency. An intensely entertaining ride that delivers the laughs in heavy doses from its first moment to the last, Life of Brian is comedy filmmaking at its most insane. Highly recommended.",Null,1,3,25 December 2014
Wind River," Another Winning Material From The Writer Of 'Sicario' & 'Hell or High Water'
","From the writer of Sicario & Hell or High Water comes another sharp, intense & thoroughly gripping crime thriller that also presents him helming the director's chair this time. As neatly structured as it is expertly directed, Wind River takes hold of the viewers' attention from its opening moments, and doesn't let go until the very end.The story revolves around the murder of a young Native American woman and follows a local game tracker who discovered her body and later assists a rookie FBI agent with the investigation. As the two gather additional clues, interrogate more people & close in on the suspects, the tracker's involvement in the case becomes more clear.Written & directed by Taylor Sheridan, Wind River makes excellent use of its cold surrounding and unfolds in a controlled & steady fashion, allowing the audience to gather all the information before moving on to the next segment. Sheridan's direction is just as accomplished as his screenplay, for all the events coalesce eventually to culminate on a bloody but wholly satisfying note.The wintry ambiance, cold surroundings & sparsely populated setting add to its grim, chilling aura. Cinematography makes sure that every moment is captured in a clear, concise fashion, and makes effective use of colour palette & lighting to enhance the image's intensity. Editing retains the mystery till the final revelation and paces the story splendidly, while the muted score is in sync with its bitter tone.Coming to the acting department, its character-driven story is powered by sincere performances from both Jeremy Renner & Elizabeth Olsen, with former delivering a very measured, calculated & emotionally acute rendition while the latter articulates her rookie character's inexperience & emotions with accuracy. The rest of the supporting cast play their part responsibly and don't leave anything to complain about.On an overall scale, Wind River is another winning material from Taylor Sheridan that brilliantly showcases his directorial talents, especially his firm grip on pacing & environment, and is one of the best cinematic surprises of the year. Translated from paper to film canvas with razor-sharp clarity, presenting Sheridan in total control of his craft, and steered by solid performances from its faithful cast, Wind River is absolutely worth your time & money.

Se7en," Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Lust. Pride. Envy. Wrath ... What's Your Deadly Sin?
","Blazingly original, darkly disturbing, downright shocking, extremely grim, relentlessly brutal, insanely powerful & emotionally devastating, David Fincher's breakthrough effort is an intensely haunting masterpiece which today is widely & rightly considered amongst the greatest thrillers ever made, and is also notable for marking the commencement of an impressive legacy that continues to get stronger with every new Fincher film.Taking place over the course of a week, the story of Se7en concerns two homicide detectives; the soon-to-retire William Somerset & the newly transferred David Mills, who become deeply involved in the recent case of appalling crimes relating to the seven deadly sins and desperately try to hunt down the sadistic serial killer before his mission is accomplished. The plot also covers the detectives' initial friction with each other & the contrast in their working methods.Ingeniously directed by David Fincher, the film is a staggering work of perfection from start to finish in which the smallest of details end up contributing to the whole premise & the dark plot in itself feels like something that was spit right out from the abyss. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker is very carefully but masterly structured with each event, character, their motivation etc being properly weighed before it is penned down in the script.Coming to the technical aspects, production design team does a stellar job in providing the decaying & dismal environment to the whole picture which is further enhanced by its bleak photography that adds to the inhospitable look this film was aiming for. Editing makes sure every sequence is relevant to the plot & smoothly unfolds the events as the film progresses while Howard Shore's score effortlessly elevates the nerve-jangling tension to a nearly unbearable level.As far as performances go, Se7en features a very dependable cast in Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow & others but what truly makes it work is the remarkable chemistry between Freeman & Pitt as Detective Somerset & Mills, respectively. Freeman plays his character in a very calm & composed manner and is instantly likable. Pitt does go a bit overexcited in few scenes but his performance still stays within the realms of his character's dimensions.Yet it's actually our serial killer who ends up stealing the show from the moment he reveals himself to the audience to the very twisted, bone-chilling & unforgettable finale that's powerful enough to haunt its viewers for a long time. Also, the opening credits sequence alone is in an entirely different league as the sense of creepiness it invokes only serves as a warning for what lies ahead and the film as a whole works immensely well as a fascinating meditation on evil.On an overall scale, Se7en is one of the darkest, creepiest & finest examples of psychological horrors that remains as effective today as it was back at its time of release. The extent to which its story tries to delve into the minds of serial killers is pretty unsettling yet the uncompromising approach the director took in envisioning a sinister script on the silver screen makes it all the more admirable. A dark, brooding & unrelenting terror of epic proportions, Se7en is certainly David Fincher's darkest film to date & definitely one of the greatest achievements of its genre.",Null,1,4,27 October 2014

Star Trek," Star Trek Gets A 21st Century Facelift!
","Freeing itself from the baggage of the previous instalments by setting its plot in an alternate timeline, thus preserving the contents of the original series without entirely depending on it, Star Trek is the reboot of the highly popular franchise of the same name that attempts to resurrect its vast universe from the ground up for a new generation of viewers but it has a lot in store for the old Trekkies as well.Taking place in an alternate reality from the original series, the story of Star Trek follows the early years of James T. Kirk & Spock, covering their time in Starfleet which is soon followed by them travelling aboard the USS Enterprise to go against Captain Nero; a Romulan from the future who has traversed back in time and is hellbent on destroying the Vulcan planet to avenge the destruction of his own home which takes place in the near future.Directed by J.J. Abrams, Star Trek presents a much revamped look & post-modern feel and is crafted in a manner that makes its mythology more appealing & accessible to newcomers without alienating the devoted fans of the original series. The plot unfolds at a vibrant pace thanks to Abrams' kinetic direction and although the screenplay does feature an interesting story, it never really ups the ante & stays at the same level from start to finish.Coming to the technical aspects, the production design team does a fabulous job in putting up some truly impressive sets on the screen. Cinematography makes extensive use of its colour palette while the dynamic camera-work carries a momentum of its own. Its 127 minutes of runtime is rarely felt, visual effects & make-up are undeniably state-of-the-art stuff, and Michael Giacchino earns a high score for chipping in with a soundtrack that simply fits.The cast comprises of Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Eric Bana, Leonard Nimoy, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg & others, and although everyone fails to make a lasting impression, none of them can be considered a disappointment either. Pine & Quinto are quite believable as Kirk & Spock, respectively, and their developing chemistry only works out in the film's favour. Also, Nimoy delivers a shot of nostalgia by reprising the role of original Spock from the original series.On an overall scale, Star Trek manages to get most things right than wrong and yet, I don't feel much love for it as, just like Star Wars, this series never interested me in the first place. The technical brilliance of this reboot cannot be denied but its main story packs in nothing that's captivating enough to change my mind. An eye-popping production that features an engaging story but lacks escalation, Star Trek is a 21st century makeover of a classic franchise for 21st century filmgoers. Worth a shot for sure.",Null,1,6,24 August 2015
Fury," Ideas Are Peaceful. History Is Violent. Fury Is Brutal.
","When it comes to depicting the brutal horrors of war, Fury does a commendable job in offering a visceral outlook through its numerous battle sequences that are relentless, unflinching & unforgiving yet the film as a whole feels more or less like a missed opportunity because despite having the potential & ingredients to join the same league as the finest examples of its genre, it comfortably settles for a score that's quite below its aspirations.A fictional story set during the final months of World War II in Nazi Germany, Fury presents a fascinating portrait of tank crews that served during the last great war and concerns the battle- hardened five-man crew of a Sherman tank & the deadly mission they embark on behind enemy lines. The film covers the bonding between the crews & the team effort they put together in a heroic attempt to hold their position despite being heavily outnumbered & outgunned.Written & directed by David Ayer, the movie makes it pretty clear in its opening moments that it aims to put up a mercilessly raw depiction of war in front of viewers & isn't going to be a nice ride for the easily distressed. Ayer's direction & script are really good in parts but where the movie falls flat is in the moments when bullets & shells are not being exchanged. However, camera-work is kinetic, editing is effective in battle scenes but choppy rest of the time & background score is a big plus.Coming to the performances, the main cast comprises of Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña & John Bernthal as the five-man crew of the Sherman tank named 'Fury' and it's Pitt as Wardaddy who really has a commanding presence here & delivers a fab performance yet sometimes his star presence comes in the way. LaBeouf is surprisingly good, Lerman's character is our ticket into the battlefield & his bonding with Wardaddy is the core ingredient that drives this story. And I didn't care much damn about Peña & Bernthal.On an overall scale, Fury features a relatively less used premise in warfare filmmaking as there aren't many examples in cinema that have captured war from the viewpoint of a tank crew & in that aspect, is a welcome addition. But it is also ridden with almost every cliché of its genre, fails to provide a more compact structure to its narrative & certainly lacks the same level of devotion in handling its characters' arcs as the one present while it is revelling in its extremity. Not even close to the finest films of its genre but a viciously entertaining ride nonetheless. Worth a shot.",Null,2,6,12 November 2014

Akira," The Most Influential Of All Things Anime!
","The most influential of all things anime, Akira no doubt played a key role in the popularity surge of Japanese animation & is considered a landmark achievement of its genre(s) that didn't just shape up most of the art in the anime world but influenced a few live-action films as well. However, purely from the storytelling perspective, it didn't do much for me.Set in the underbelly of post-apocalyptic Tokyo, Akira tells the story of a teenage biker who inadvertently gets involved in a government secret program & ends up with psychic powers that are beyond his control. The only people capable of stopping him are the leader of the biker gang he used to be a part of & a bunch of psionics who know what his power can unleash.Co-written & directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, Akira is based on his manga of the same name & he has transformed it on the film canvas in a truly astonishing manner, setting up whole new standards in the process. The futuristic world it puts on the screen is highly fascinating to look at plus the cyberpunk tone present in its dystopian society provides the right feel to it as well.The screenplay is finely adapted & while its execution makes sure that meticulous attention is provided to smallest of details, the narrative unfortunately isn't captivating enough & even the characters are quite uninteresting. The animation was a groundbreaking feat of its time, the camera-work is brimming with surplus energy, the use of sound is expertly carried out but its score is a disappointment.On an overall scale, Akira is a technical marvel that rarely lets its viewers breathe for it runs at breakneck speed from start to finish & packs in more action n violence than anticipated but considering its legacy, I expected much more from it. And although I won't be a part of its ever expanding fanbase for now, I do get what the fuss is all about.

Train to Busan," World War Z Meets Snowpiercer In A Non-Stop Thrill Ride
","A non-stop locomotive ride that lets the fast-moving & instantly-infected zombies from Brad Pitt- starring World War Z go haywire inside a fast-moving train, this South Korean zombie apocalypse horror is a highly gripping, thoroughly entertaining & consistently engaging journey that moves at breakneck speed from start to finish and keeps ratcheting up the tension throughout its runtime.The story of Train to Busan finds an absentee father & his young daughter boarding a train from Seoul to Busan to meet her mother. But all hell breaks loose when the train is overrun by zombies and results in death & reanimation of numerous staff members & passengers. With nowhere to run, the two team up with other surviving members to ward off the infected until the train makes it to its destination.Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, the film borrows certain elements from Marc Forster's World War Z & Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer but carves an original storyline that's brilliantly executed on the film canvas. Sang-ho's kinetic direction keeps escalating the stakes with skilfully crafted moments of horror and slowly but steadily manages to compel the viewers to invest in the characters' journey & eventual fate.The zombies retain their vicious nature but an added weakness does allow for some suspenseful moments that are expertly carried out. While the movie makes use of CGI in the depiction of the reanimated corpses, the zombies look far more believable than the artificial mess they were in the film they are lifted from, not to mention that even the human characters exhibit an emotional core that was missing in that feature.The dramatic portions, however, are a tad too overblown as the director is unable to pull them off with same zeal with which he carries out the action-horror segments. The technical aspects are finely executed and the film as a whole really benefits from its energetic camera-work, tight editing, excellent choreography, first-rate production design & fitting score and although a few CGI shots don't look realistic enough, it serves its purpose well.Coming to the performances, the entire cast chips in with serviceable inputs and even though the characters they play lack an interesting persona & certain amount of depth, the actors somehow succeed in making the audience get on board with their characters' predicament. While everyone does an apt job in their given roles, there really was no need to add a despicable human character when you already have a train full of zombies so that felt a bit forced.On an overall scale, Train to Busan still makes up for an exciting, action-packed zombie horror and boasts numerous sequences of sustained terror. The build-up is quick and once the train begins to move, it becomes all the more relentless & unstoppable. A few shortcomings like numerous stupid decisions made by a few characters does rob it of its uniqueness but there is no denying that Train to Busan delivers a healthy dose of adrenaline-filled extravaganza until the very end.",Null,6,14,24 January 2017
Citizen Kane," A Classic Story Of Power And The Press.
","Citizen Kane is the motion picture which, since its release, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers & even many viewers around the world as the greatest film of all time. And although I agree to some extent that, purely on a technical scale, this might be the most influential picture ever made but based solely on its plot & story, there are far better examples in cinema than this one.Still, there is no denying that Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted feature which not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time of production but also ended up completely rewriting the manuals of filmmaking in the process. The film tells the story of a publishing tycoon whose death makes news reporters scramble around to discover the meaning of his final utterance.While there is a lot to take in here, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the overall structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, an insufferable boring story. So boring that it took me 6 unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it accomplished that, the end result was surprisingly better than what I was expecting from it.The film presents an unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people & is wonderfully assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, splendid score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera.On an overall scale, Citizen Kane is arguably the most experimental cinema of its era that has somehow managed to stand the test of time and is certainly one of world cinema's highly influential & important works whose significance to the film medium is simply as mysterious & profound as the symbolism behind the word, 'Rosebud'.",Null,2,3,9 August 2013
Darkest Hour," Dull, Drab & Dour, 'Darkest Hour' Is Nothing More Than An Oscar Bait
","What could have been a captivating insight into the psyche of one of 20th century's most iconic, important & influential figures is reduced to an exceptionally dull, drab & dreary biopic that's crafted with zero passion, narrated with no flair, and remains a monotonous ride throughout its runtime. Darkest Hour features none of the traits that made its central character such a contentious yet utterly fascinating individual, and its only redeeming quality is Gary Oldman's transformative performance.",Null,4,10,4 February 2018
Monster," One Of The Strongest Directorial Debuts Of 21st Century
","Patty Jenkins' feature film debut is a thoroughly gripping & unexpectedly heartbreaking biopic that details the troubled life of notorious serial killer Aileen Wuornos in a way that surprisingly evokes a little sympathy for a despicable persona, and benefits greatly from Charlize Theron's jaw-dropping transformation & Academy Award-winning performance.Set in Florida, Monster tells the story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute-turned-serial killer who was convicted & executed for her crimes during the late 1980s. The plot mainly covers the relationship she develops with a young woman after moving to Florida, and attempts to shed some light on the events that led her to a path there was no coming back from.Written & directed by Patty Jenkins, Monster is an impressive start to her filmmaking career and remains one of the strongest directorial debuts of 21st century. Jenkins approaches the real-life account with an open viewpoint and portrays Aileen's life as a tragic one without undermining the unforgivable acts she committed. Also, her relationship with her girlfriend is sincerely illustrated.The best thing about Monster, however, is Charlize Theron who single-handedly makes this film work with a performance that's as compelling as it is chilling. Undergoing a physical transformation so profound & disturbing that she's almost unrecognisable in the role, Theron plays Aileen from inside out, and keeps a firm grip on her emotions & expressions at all times. Christina Ricci is in as her girlfriend and does well with what she's given.On an overall scale, Monster is a skilfully crafted, grippingly told & outstandingly performed biopic that is able to infuse shades of grey into what appears black & white from afar, and will always be memorable for Charlize Theron's career-best performance. Making the viewers feel sympathy for an unlikeable character is never an easy job but thanks to Patty Jenkins' refined script & first-rate direction, and Theron's total devotion to her role, Monster accomplishes that with effortless ease. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,13 June 2017

Inglourious Basterds," You Know What? This Just Might Be Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece!
","The sixth film by Quentin Tarantino finds the esteemed filmmaker in sublime form as he blends the genres of war & spaghetti western into one stylish, violent & vengeful cinematic delight that brims with Tarantino's patented wordplay, fascinating characters, uninhibited violence, outstanding cast & excellent performances to deliver a thrilling ride that enthrals, entertains & satisfies on all levels, and keeps getting better with every subsequent viewing.Set in Nazi-occupied France, Inglourious Basterds intercuts two story lines. First concerns a young Jewish girl who, after witnessing her family being killed by an SS officer, plots her revenge several years later when a German war film is arranged to premiere at her theatre. The second plot follows a team of Jewish-American soldiers who plan to assassinate all the Nazi leaders attending the film premiere. The two plots of revenge eventually coincide as the story nears its conclusion.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds is told in five chapters and features the best opening scene of any Tarantino movie to date. The first twenty minutes is a pure exercise in unabridged, patient & flawless filmmaking for the director allows the dialogue-heavy segment to instil an unnerving ambiance on its own and keeps a firm check on the pace & camera movements. It also introduces us to the villain in grand style and by the time the first chapter ends, we know all there is to know about Hans Landa & his cunning tactics.Tarantino's direction is terrific while his screenplay is a gem in itself. Adding enough meat on every character's bone, he manages to carve out many suspenseful moments from the most unexpected corners and while his usual elements, such as pop culture references, dark humour, blood-soaked violence are in tact, the writer-director also removes the veil of hypocrisy to show that all humans, regardless of their labels, are capable of intense cruelty. Also, by setting his narrative in a fictional alternate history, he frees himself from following the fact formula and plays as per his wishes.The technical aspects are fabulously carried out, each adding something to the movie. Production design team does a really fine job in setting up the World War II iconography, albeit with little dose of western landscape. Cinematography gives its images a sumptuous look n feel, while exquisitely moving the camera around to capture the drama in splendid detail. Editing is expertly carried out & its 152 minutes of runtime is consistently paced. And as always, Tarantino manages to put together an amazing soundtrack, comprising of wonderful tracks that seamlessly integrates with the scenes and effortlessly uplift the whole experience.Coming to the performances, Inglourious Basterds features a stellar cast in Brad Pitt, Christopher Waltz, Mélanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Daniel Brühl & others, and all of them are fabulous in their given roles. Pitt plays a character that belongs to his comfort zone & does well with what he's given. Fassbender is present in just one chapter yet manages to leave his mark. Kruger & Brühl balance their act really well, Roth gets to play the coolest basterd of them all as that skull bashing scene had all the build-up elements of a spaghetti western Mexican standoff. However, the best performances come from Waltz & Laurent.Making a lasting impression right within the opening segment, Waltz brings this ingeniously written character to life as per the exact demands of the screenplay and delivers an absolutely impeccable performance that easily goes down as one of decade's best. The character of Hans Landa is one of Tarantino's finest creations and Waltz only gets better in that role as the story progresses. Without Waltz's contribution, Inglourious Basterds amounts to pretty much nothing plus it's a rare instance of perfect actor-character marriage. Laurent is another revelation and plays her part with stunning finesse plus and just like Waltz, her input is devoid of any faults.On an overall scale, Inglourious Basterds is another original, sophisticated & downright captivating extravaganza from Quentin Tarantino that, like few of his earlier flicks, requires a little getting used to. Jam-packed with vibrant flavours & accomplished in nearly every filmmaking aspect, the movie brilliantly exhibits just how far this master storyteller has come over the years in tightening his grip around his craft. One of the best films of its year and certainly amongst the finest from Tarantino's filmography, Inglourious Basterds is a slow burner but it has all the ingredients of an instant classic and considering numerous other positives, I think this just might be his masterpiece.",Null,2,6,4 January 2016
Amistad," One Of Steven Spielberg's Least Appreciated Works
","Powered by sincere performances, told with unflinching determination & strongly resonating the voice of freedom, Amistad finds director Steven Spielberg trying to expand his creative horizons for this historical drama brings on screen one of American history's most shameful acts & while the few artistic license taken here is up for dispute, the film is engaging for the most part.Set in 1839, Amistad refers to a slave ship carrying a cargo of Africans who were sold into slavery & are on their way to American coastline. On the way, a mutiny takes place on the ship as the slaves free themselves & take over the ship. Yet, deceived by a couple of white survivors, they arrive in America where they are brought to trial & find an unlikely ally in an abolitionist lawyer.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Amistad opens with the mutiny sequence that might be too disturbing to watch for a few and throughout its first act, the film maintains its tight grip on the viewers' emotions. Camera-work is skilfully carried out, Editing lets the film run a tad too long, set pieces are in tune with the timeline this story is set in & the background score by John Williams is evocative.Coming to the performances, Amistad packs in quite a star-studded ensemble in Matthew McConaughey, Djimon Hounsou, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Pete Postlethwaite, Stellan Skarsgård, Chiwetel Ejiofor & Nigel Hawthorne, and the best work comes from both McConaughey & Hounsou. Freeman rarely does anything, Hopkins makes his mark only in the final moments & Ejiofor does a good job in his debut role.On an overall scale, Amistad remains one of Spielberg's least appreciated works that can use a wider audience for its plea for freedom, equality & humanity alone makes it a worthy example of its genre yet the overlong plot, snail-paced narration & sentimentality approach robs it of its true value. Starting on a promising note, leaking fuel for the rest of its runtime & almost running out of it near the end, Amistad is a mixed bag in the illustrious career of Steven Spielberg.",Null,0,1,31 May 2015

Dawn of the Dead," Good Zombie Fun. Nothing More. Nothing Less.
","Zack Snyder's directorial debut is a decently entertaining & delightfully violent re-envisioning of George A. Romero's 1978 classic and while it keeps its premise similar to its source material, the film does take inspiration from Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later for its depiction of zombies. However, despite the 21st century upgrade, it's more or less forgettable.The story of Dawn of the Dead follows a nurse who, following a zombie apocalypse, takes refuge inside a shopping mall along with a few human survivors. Surrounded by a swarm of flesh-eating zombies and running out of supplies, the group soon realises that they cannot stay there forever and devise a plan to escape the horde that's waiting for them outside the mall.Written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder's, the film simply lifts the plot of the original and places it in a contemporary setting, without the subtleties, themes or social commentary that made Romero's film a classic. This remake is a straightforward action horror that revels in violence & gore, and opts for a more visceral ride than a thought-provoking one, at which it succeeds.Populated with a tad excess characters, which inhibit character development, the film still retains its sense of fun and packs a good dose of action. The vibrant colour palette, slow-mo technique & swift manoeuvring of camera add to its kinetic flair, but turning those reanimated corpses into fast & agile creatures doesn't make much of a difference. Performances are fine for the most part but there are no standouts.On an overall scale, Dawn of the Dead doesn't bring anything new to the table yet qualifies as an acceptable remake that achieves what it set out to do. It may strike a better chord with those who haven't seen Romero's version but unlike that revered classic, there's nothing memorable about it. Opening on a thrilling note, falling flat in the middle & regaining some interest in the epilogue, this remake is good zombie fun. Nothing more, nothing less.",Null,1,2,27 June 2017
Iron Man 2," One Of The Worst Sequels Ever Made.
","Everything that made Iron Man such a refreshing, entertaining & thrilling ride is completely lost in this sequel as the third instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is possibly their worst film to date, is a pathetic follow-up to what was & still remains a fascinating action- adventure, and even Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma is unable to conceal its poor narrative & shoddy execution.Set six months after the events of the first film, Iron Man 2 continues the story of Tony Stark and covers the intense media attention he's been enjoying after revealing his identity as Iron Man to the whole world while resisting the US government who covets his technology & battling his own personal health as well for his arc reactor is poisoning him. And we also have a new enemy in town pursuing a personal vendetta against Stark.Directed by Jon Favreau, it's hard to believe that it's the same guy who helmed the last feature for he seems to have forgotten everything that made the previous film work. The screenplay is terrible from the start for the concept looks clear but it lacks refinement on deeper levels. Cinematography is fine, Editing makes sure every irrelevant scene makes its way into the final print & there's nothing new to add about its score.Coming to the performances, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke & Sam Rockwell join the reprising cast while Don Cheadle takes over Terrence Howard's role but not even one of them is good enough. Downey Jr. retains his charm n wit but even he fails to bring back the magic that was there the last time, Rourke started well but is then completely sidelined until the end, Johansson fails to make a big impression while Rockwell is surprisingly forgettable.On an overall scale, Iron Man 2 is a major step down when compared to its predecessor, is a massive downgrade in quality in all filmmaking aspects & a definite loss of opportunity to build something spectacular after such a brilliant platform was provided to it by the first film. Even the action is pretty boring & is over way too quick, the villain isn't intimidating enough & majority of its characters are treated as caricatures. One of the worst sequels ever made.",Null,2,6,25 March 2015
Alien: Resurrection," How The Mighty Have Fallen!
","A completely unnecessary sequel that proudly takes over the label of Alien franchise's weakest chapter & also features an odd bit of interspecies erotica, Alien: Resurrection was seen by many as an improvement over Alien³ when it was released but that's only because it didn't have to deal with the reputation of two genre-defining chapters of the franchise & unlike its preceding installment, it only gets worse on repeated viewings.Set 200 years after the events of Alien³, Alien: Resurrection finds Ellen Ripley resurrected by successful cloning & has the Alien queen surgically removed from her body. In the hope of breeding this magnificent life form & study its biology, human hosts are used which are delivered by mercenaries but when the Aliens escape their enclosures, Ripley & the rest of the survivors attempt to escape & destroy the spaceship before it reaches Earth.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the film tries to make a tonal shift from a sci-fi horror to a dark comedy but eventually fails at achieving any of its goals as it pretty much sucks as a horror film, doesn't carry enough meat for an action or sci-fi feature and the black comedy elements only come off as far too stupid. Joss Whedon's script is another culprit here even if it contains some interesting ideas & is completely inept when it comes to characterization or action or suspense.Cinematography adds more tinge to the picture & also includes close-ups of characters when they're busy making stupid faces. Set design is passable & although the alien creatures aren't poorly rendered like it was in the last film, it still doesn't come close to their seamless depiction in the first two films. Visual effects ain't up to the mark either despite its high-budget, music doesn't even feel like a part of the film & the final creature which is a human/alien hybrid is so grotesquely designed that it's just too absurd & laughable.Coming to the performances, Alien: Resurrection manages to even surpass the last chapter when it comes to what's known as overacting. Other than Sigourney Weaver & Winona Ryder to some extent, the entire cast looks horrible with their exaggerated expressions, sounds horrible with their overly cheesy dialogues & plays horrible by delivering terrible performances from start to finish. Weaver's performance ain't that great either, however, she does enough to avoid any major complaint on her part.On an overall scale, Alien: Resurrection is the most light-hearted & cheesiest chapter of the Alien franchise which fails at everything it was trying to do. Adding nothing new to the franchise that we haven't seen before, featuring a set of uninteresting characters most of whom served their purpose as just death fodders & providing no excitement or thrill in any of its action sequences, Alien: Resurrection succeeds in ruining the very franchise that redefined horror, sci-fi & action with its first two chapters and suffered a heavy dent with the third.",Null,1,2,22 September 2014
World War Z," Neither Scares Nor Thrills! World War Zzzzzzzzz!
","Lacking the chilling sense of dread, escalating tension & disturbing gore that usually comes associated with this subgenre of horror, World War Z inclines more towards the action genre than horror, packs in almost all the elements of a generic summer blockbuster, and as far as the subject of zombie apocalypse goes, this is one of the lamest movies out there.Based on the novel of the same name, World War Z tells the story of retired UN investigator Gerry Lane who, along with his family, narrowly manages to escape the zombie outbreak in his city but soon finds himself on a new mission that requires him to travel around the globe in order to find a possible cure to the pandemic that is quickly annihilating the human race.Directed by Marc Forster (Finding Neverland & Quantum of Solace), World War Z takes the living dead of 28 Days Later..., injects them with plenty of steroids, gives them the benefit of CGI and allows them to go completely lunatic on the screen which, instead of working as a chaotic nightmare, looks too artificial to have any effect and eliminates the seriousness the movie was aiming for.The screenplay fails to provide any character depth, the ones that matter are carved out of cardboards, the story lacks any sense of direction, and the ending is pretty weak. Sure it's fast paced & action-packed but it's just empty visuals with nothing at stake. Performances are dull, Brad Pitt's star presence helps a bit but his input looks like he was asked to utter his lines without rehearsing any of his scenes.On an overall scale, World War Z is a highly disjointed mess that keeps piling one segment over another without any idea of where it's headed, neither scares nor thrills, and is simply as forgettable as any typical summer blockbuster. The concept is promising on a certain level but the execution is so disappointing that the movie as a whole is a waste of time & money. Watch it only if you can't resist a Brad Pitt film.

The Hunger Games," Good But Could've Been Better. A Decent Start Nonetheless.
","Set in a dystopian future where a totalitarian government is in charge, The Hunger Games presents an annual event in which a boy & girl are chosen from each of the 12 districts to compete against each other until only one survives in the end to be crowned as the winner. I had no idea of what this film was about but now that I've seen it, The Hunger Games looks like a toned down version of the violent Japanese film, Battle Royale that is clearly targeted at a younger audience & although it had the capability to be a brilliant adventure but it's not due to many noticeable flaws.What works in favour of this film is its theme, a darker tone than its counterparts & Jennifer Lawrence who turns out to be the thread that holds this movie together as Katniss Everdeen and even though her character never fleshes out as much as we would've liked, it still maintains a level that can be appreciated. What doesn't work is that the story had the scope to give us the entertainment that's worth our money but is indeed very much toned down; maybe for monetary reasons or whatever. The character never develop throughout the story, the production design, costumes, makeup etc felt cartoony & the acting from everyone else was mediocre & lacked depth.On an overall scale, The Hunger Games manages to be a decently entertaining but entertaining nonetheless, is briskly paced, well-carried by Lawrence & presents an intriguing view of a dystopian society. There are setbacks & falls along the road but it manages to crawl by all of it to come out on the other side & compared to its genre counterparts, is a much better beginning than what others have offered us until now but there is also a lot of things that this film can improve upon & it will be interesting to see if it learns from its mistakes in the upcoming sequels. All in all, The Hunger Games is a good film but had the potential to be even better; an opportunity that went wasted.",Null,0,3,21 January 2014
Zootopia," The Best Film Of The Year, So Far.
","From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far.Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy.Co-directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics & handles its topical themes with care.The 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity & vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette & spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace.The cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice & soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino's ebullient score seamlessly blends in & compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting & wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes & message.On an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious & risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio's favour. Also, its arrival couldn't have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice & stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far.

12 Monkeys," An Insane Meditation On Madness
","An intriguing portrait of a dystopian future, an insane meditation on madness & an interesting take on the idea of time travel, reality & memories, Twelve Monkeys must've been one of the most creative examples of science-fiction filmmaking when it was released but looking back now, it doesn't feel as impressive anymore despite the innumerable twists & turns it has to offer.The story of Twelve Monkeys presents a future in which almost all of humanity has been annihilated by a deadly virus which has forced the remaining survivors to live beneath the surface. The plot concerns a convict who's sent back in time to collect more data on the man- made virus, which seems to be connected to a mysterious organization called The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.Directed by Terry Gilliam, the film has a strangely unnerving atmosphere looming over it from start to finish which is further helped by its eccentric set pieces, clever use of camera angles & unconventional editing which tries to engage the viewers with its constantly shifting tones & twists. And its background score is no slouch either for it further enhances its moody ambiance.Coming to the performances, the cast of Twelve Monkeys stars Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt & Madeleine Stowe, and all three of them are crazily good in their given roles. Willis chips in strongly as the convict who's sent back in time, Pitt is completely deranged in his role but is also the most impressive of the three, and Stowe's character is able to hold on to her sanity for the most part.On an overall scale, Twelve Monkeys is full of intricate themes, ideas & homages that's presented in a manner not everyone is going to enjoy. It does play with the viewers' minds & is a bold piece of filmmaking but its acting also comes off as exaggerated on many occasions, its romance subplot feels unnecessary, the entire production appears somewhat dated & for me, it also failed to live up to its legacy.

Au Revoir les Enfants," 'Stop Acting So Pious, There's A War Going On, Kid.'
","An elegantly crafted tale of friendship, compassion & boyhood, Au Revoir Les Enfants is a heartbreaking, poignant & tragic cinema that's actually based on the events which took place during the childhood of this film's director and is an endearing portrait of life at school, student rivalry & beauty of friendship.Set in France during the final years of the Second World War, the events of Au Revoir Les Enfants takes place in a Catholic boarding school and is narrated through the eyes of Julien Quentin; one of the students at the school. The plot covers his relationship with a newly arrived enigmatic student with whom he's at odds at first but the two learn to get along & share a big secret.Directed by Louis Malle, the film is nicely crafted with many details beautifully captured by its calmly moving camera. The screenplay tries to get an authentic vibe of education in Catholic schools, the conversations between its characters carry the childlike innocence & the performances by its cast, especially the child actors, becomes more captivating as the story progresses.On an overall scale, Au Revoir Les Enfants (also known as Goodbye Children) isn't in anyway a hard-hitting or emotionally scarring cinema but the gentle manner in which it depicts its premise really makes you care for its characters, makes you wish they get away, makes you wish for a miracle & although its subject matter has been dealt in a better manner, the film is worthy of a watch for its two main characters alone.",Null,2,2,9 September 2014
The Impossible," Nothing Is More Powerful Than The Human Spirit
","From the director of Spanish chiller The Orphanage, The Impossible arrives as a disaster film based on the true account of a close-knit family. However, no matter how spellbinding some of its key sequences look or how strong the performances are, the film unfortunately falls short of making its desired impact & is marred by its incredibly manipulative premise.The Impossible tells the story of a close-knit family vacationing in Thailand during December 2004 but their Christmas celebration is cut short when the entire South-East Asia is stuck by a devastating tsunami the very next morning, altering the life & fate of thousands. The story covers the plight of this particular family & their fight for survival against all odds.Directed by J.A. Bayona, the direction is pretty good but the script is just full of emotionally manipulative & overly sentimental moments that nearly derails the whole picture. The best scene is of course the tsunami sequence for it is captured in quite an unflinching, brutal & raw manner plus looks highly authentic while the rest of its technical aspects are nicely executed.Coming to the performances, The Impossible features a fine cast in Naomi Watts & Ewan McGregor and while the former does a great job in one of her most commanding roles, the latter does a good job as well. The rest of the cast, especially the child actors, also chip in finely in their given roles but the writing part is handled so badly that it's difficult to take it seriously sometimes.On an overall scale, The Impossible advertises itself as a heart-pounding tale about human kindness rising against the deadliest calamity of 21st century yet it tries so hard to evoke a sympathetic response from its viewers that its aspired realism simply goes out the window. Entertaining for many, rewarding for some & a good cinema overall if not a bad one, The Impossible is worth a shot.",Null,1,3,9 August 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A Worthy Sequel That Gets Most Things Right, If Not All
","The follow-up chapter to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl might appear inferior in content & a step-down in quality of narration but it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that presents significant upgrades in many aspects, takes the spectacle of the first film to a higher level and despite a few hiccups remains a highly entertaining & amusing ride for the most part.The second instalment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Dead Man's Chest continues the journey of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as he's reminded of the debt he owes to Davy Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, and then races against time to steal Jones' heart in order to strike a bargain with him. But he isn't the only one as other friends & foes seek the heart for their own agendas as well.Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest opens on a really interesting note, takes more time than before to set up its premise because of which a few sequences feel static but once the board is set, the movie truly delivers the epic spectacle it promised. The screenplay follows multiple story lines often interacting with each other at times but it does come together in the end to form a coherent structure.The technical aspects present a massive upgrade, thanks to the higher budget. Set pieces are even more impressive than before and both the Black Pearl & the Flying Dutchman are magnificently designed & detailed. Cinematography exhibits a dynamic range in capturing all the action & drama, the exotic locations are beautifully photographed and it also makes extensive use of the colour palette to provide its tale a more vivid touch.Editing fails to give the narrative a tightly-knitted structure like it did in the earlier chapter for there are a few sequences that could've been further trimmed, even the pace is uneven at places and its 150 minutes of runtime is felt on few occasions. Visual effects is a major step-up that ups the ante by a significant margin and what it did with CGI back then was an achievement in itself, plus it works in tandem with make-up team to make its effects work.Finally, the music department exhibits a major forward leap as well. While the previous film was scored by one of Hans Zimmer's prodigies, it's the master himself who takes the front seat for this sequel and delivers a soundtrack that certainly goes down as one of his finest compositions. Orchestrated with bigger instruments, Zimmer's score pulsates with an epic feel that encapsulates the whole picture and goes a long way in enhancing the experience.Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley reprise their respective roles of Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth Swann and further build upon their inputs of the first film. Depp once again overshadows everyone with yet another swashbuckling turn as the savvy pirate but his performance isn't as terrific as it was in the previous movie. Also making an instant impression of his own is Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, and what an intriguing character he is!On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest might be slightly inferior to The Curse of the Black Pearl but it's just as enjoyable, entertaining & amusing, if not more. The plot tends to be more inclined towards the fantasy element but it takes the humour with it and the sense of adventure is kept alive throughout its runtime. It's just that few scenes exist only for viewers' amusement & contribute nothing vital to the story. Definitely more epic in both scope & ambition, Dead Man's Chest is a worthy sequel that gets most things right, if not all. Delightfully recommended.",Null,0,1,16 July 2015
Rocky V," Skip It! It Doesn't Even Feel Like A Rocky Movie!
","The fifth instalment in the Rocky series, Rocky V finds Rocky Balboa in retirement & poverty after he suffers a serious brain injury from his previous fight and is reluctantly made to leave boxing. Also learning that his entire wealth is lost on the stock market, Rocky returns to his Pennsylvania neighbourhood with his family and after meeting a promising boxer, takes him under his wing. Things are set in motion when his protégé betrays him.Written by Sylvester Stallone & directed by John G. Avildsen, the film reunites the team that was responsible for Rocky and now, they're also responsible for coming up with the worst chapter in the series for Rocky V is an uninspired, tedious & dull movie from start to finish and for what was supposed to be the final chapter of the franchise, it doesn't get any worse than this. With no build up, no story, no proper resolution, the film lacks everything.Avildsen's direction isn't good at all, Stallone's writing is another culprit. The story takes the life of Balboa family back to square one, with father-son tension added to the storyline that could've been interesting on some level but after a while, you just don't care. Early into the movie, it's evident that this film lacks the heart & soul of its predecessors and diverges a lot from the usual formula that had kept the fans around despite the poor sequels.Despite more budget, Rocky V fails to make proper use of it for the set pieces are similar to how they were in the first film, there is nothing to mention about its camera-work, Editing is disappointing for the entire 104 minutes of its runtime fails to offer anything interesting and for the most part, it's just plain boring cinema. Performances aren't worthy of mention at all for Stallone hams like crazy, so does the rest of the cast, the relationship between Balboa & his son is ineffectively handled, and the ending is just lame.On an overall scale, Rocky V is without a doubt the weakest instalment in the franchise and a sequel that shouldn't have been made in the first place. Stallone has gone on to discard it in the later years but his screenplay for that movie was just as bad. Although it's a shame that what was supposed to be the series finale didn't end the saga on a high note, it's also a relief considering that it made Stallone go back to the roots of the first picture and take ample time to draw out a fitting conclusion, which arrived 16 years later in the form of the much superior Rocky Balboa.

Argo," Wildly Entertaining. Incredibly Tense. Fiercely Exciting.
","Winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Argo is Ben Affleck's finest work as a director, is one of the best films of its year & is quite an accomplished piece of storytelling that expertly recounts the real-life event that took place in Iran during the Iranian Revolution in which 6 US diplomats were rescued by CIA with the help of Canadian government.Set in 1979 Iran, the story of Argo follows 6 US diplomats who go into hiding when Iranian revolutionaries invade the American embassy in Tehran, taking several of them hostages. In an effort to get its people out of the country, CIA goes through various options & eventually settles with an insane plan; to arrive in Iran for scouting locations of a fake Canadian film & smuggle its people as part of the production crew.Directed by Ben Affleck, the best thing about Argo is the way it builds up its plot & manages to keep the tension alive throughout its runtime. Affleck shows massive improvement in his work behind the camera for he methodically elevates the anxiety that culminates with a nail- biting finale & in the process, adds another quality feature to his résumé as a filmmaker. But there are also many elements in the film worth complaining about.The story takes a great amount of artistic license with the true event, completely downplays the role other nations played in making the then-covert operation a success, makes use of few inaccuracies for dramatic purposes & while these elements did provide a more thrilling cinematic experience, the absence of subtitles when any Iranian is on the screen but the presence of one when an American is speaking the same language is plainly insulting.Coming to the technical aspects, production design aims for the 80s aesthetic & gets much of it right. Cinematography encapsulates the whole narrative with a foreboding atmosphere that never dissipates. Editing keeps the plot tightly-gripped at all moments & there isn't any moment in the picture that feels irrelevant to the plot. And last but not the least, Alexandre Desplat chips in with a soundtrack that makes the experience all the more brutal & restless.As far as performances go, Argo features a dependable cast in Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston & others. Although none of the characters are fleshed out that well, the work by Affleck, Arkin & Goodman still lifts the film up by a few points. The actors playing the US diplomats also do a fine job in their given roles & in the end, the sum of the inputs put in by its entire cast manages to do a better job than any individual contribution.On an overall scale, Argo may have a few shortcomings in the narrative plus its retelling of the 'Canadian Caper' leaves out much of what actually happened but simply as a thriller, it just works. It manages to sustain its uneasy ambiance for 2 hours, effortlessly succeeds in keeping its audience at the edge of their seats and is an incredibly tense, fiercely exciting & wildly entertaining ride which in the end feels worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far.",Null,0,2,8 October 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Powerhouse Of Action, Spectacle & Humour. Prepare To Be Blown Out Of The Water.
","A thoroughly fascinating blend of action, adventure, comedy, horror & fantasy, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliantly scripted, skilfully directed & cleverly narrated cinema that paints an interesting portrait of pirates mythology on the film canvas like never before and is also notable for bringing to life one of the most iconic characters of 21st century cinema.The story of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl follows the quest of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow who teams up with a talented blacksmith, Will Turner, to rescue the latter's love, Elizabeth Swann, who's been taken hostage on the notorious pirate ship, Black Pearl, which is commanded by the feared Captain Barbossa and carries a crew of cursed men who were once Jack's allies.Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean brims with an energetic & creative vibe which keeps the story refreshing throughout its runtime, doesn't take much time to get its main plot moving, and with its firm grip on refined storytelling ends up infusing a new life into the pirates genre. The screenplay handles its different genres with remarkable ease and also presents a fine balance between its various elements.The production design team does a stellar job with its period sets & meticulously designed ships. Cinematography makes fab use of its camera to capture each sequence in fine detail, use of colour palette is quite splendid and the expertly staged camera angles & movements make its story all the more captivating. Even the Costumes are pretty much in tune with the depicted timeline, and the work in make-up department is no slouch either.Editing is undoubtedly one of its strongest highlights for it never allows the viewers to settle down, keeps the adventurous tone alive & kicking all the way from start to finish, and paces its 143 minutes of story amazingly well. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff which blends into the narrative quite seamlessly. The background score is composed by Klaus Badelt and is an absolute delight that enhances the whole experience by a great deal with its pulsating tracks.Coming to the performances, Pirates of the Caribbean features an awesome cast in Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley and they all manage to leave their mark, one way or another. Depp makes Jack Sparrow completely his own for it's his added inputs only which gives his character a unique look & edge over the others, and there isn't one scene where he isn't the show-stealer. Rush also impresses a lot with his crazy take on Captain Barbossa, while Bloom & Knightley deliver good performances in their given roles.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a powerhouse of action, spectacle & humour that's loaded with all the ingredients one requires to make a great blockbuster, which it is in every sense of the word. A work of ingenious craftsmanship that packs in a whole lot of fun, absolutely nails its comic timing, wonderfully balance all its aspects, delivers an entertainment worth your time & money, and is an extremely enjoyable, unforgettable & swashbuckling ride that presents Johnny Depp at the pinnacle of his talents while permanently engraving Captain Jack Sparrow into the annals of cinema & pop culture.",Null,1,2,15 July 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," If You Liked J.J. Abrams' Star Trek, Then You'll Like This One!
","Treading on the same path as the previous chapter, the second instalment in the rebooted Star Trek franchise retains the freshness, vibrancy & momentum of the original, adds a few upgrades of its own to give it a more polished look but just like its predecessor, it stays on the same level from start to finish, thus bringing neither excitement nor escalation to the plot.Set one year after the events of the first film, Star Trek Into Darkness finds the crew of USS Enterprise going against a new enemy that has risen from within their own organisation and who makes his intentions clear when he detonates an entire fleet & leaves the world in complete chaos, following which Captain Kirk leads his team on a manhunt to apprehend the man responsible.Directed by J.J. Abrams, Star Trek Into Darkness finds its director in prime form for he has crafted this picture with same rigour & passion with which he made the previous one work. The script further expands the rebooted universe, adds newer elements & also resurrects a notorious antagonist this time, and yet the whole experience is pretty much the same as last time.The set pieces are wonderfully detailed & grander in appearance. Cinematography presents a slightly darker tinge while maintaining the same kinetic camera-work that worked in favour of the last feature. Its 133 minutes of runtime isn't felt but the story never shifts gears at any given point.Also, the use of CGI is overwhelming at times. And Michael Giacchino chips in with yet another amazing score.Coming to the performances, the returning cast of Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana & Simon Pegg do exhibit a better grip on their respective characters but this time, it's Benedict Cumberbatch who ends up stealing the show for his screen presence is infectious while his performance is quite impressive and yet, the notorious character he's revealed to be never seems convincing enough & feels a bit forced.On an overall scale, Star Trek Into Darkness does everything a sequel is supposed to do, is an enjoyable, entertaining & adequately satisfying ride for the most part, is further boosted by Cumberbatch's stellar performance, plus packs in a fine dose of spectacle in its riveting tale and yet, the whole experience of sitting through it is virtually the same as the previous chapter. So if you liked Abrams' Star Trek, then his Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely for you.",Null,3,5,25 August 2015

Beauty and the Beast," One of Disney's Most Memorable Features.
","Effortlessly enduring the test of time, Beauty and the Beast manages to retain the same flair & charm that made it an instant classic during its time of release, The story covers the relationship between a beast who once was a prince before he was turned into a monster as a punishment for his selfishness & a young, beautiful woman named Belle who is imprisoned in his castle.Elegantly presented with pleasant songs, heartwarming music & superb use of imagination as well as humour, the film even today manages to grip its viewers into its fairy tale right from the opening moments. The animation is dazzling, voice acting is impressive, each frame is finely detailed plus the story is very well narrated & paced too.On an overall scale, Beauty and the Beast isn't the best ever Disney film in my book but it surely is amongst the most memorable ones. Its message i.e. 'looks never really matter when you own a f*cking castle :P' is heard loud & clear and makes sense even today. One of Walt Disney's finest offerings that works even better as an enchanting story of love, Beauty and the Beast is a delightful musical that should still appeal equally to people of all ages. Just go for it.",Null,1,1,24 April 2014
Green Room," A Delicious Slice Of Violent, Unapologetic & Breakneck Cinema
","From the writer-director of Murder Party & Blue Ruin, Green Room is a neatly envisioned, extremely effective & unabashedly violent horror thriller that's absolutely remorseless with its content, brims with charged tension & makes excellent use of its foreboding ambiance to finish as a bone-chilling, machete-sharp cinema that offers no respite from the slaughter that ensues once things go south, and will effortlessly manage to keep its viewers on the edge of their seats throughout its runtime.Set in a remote club in the backwoods, the story of Green Room follows members of a punk rock band who have a gig in the area filled with neo-nazi skinheads. After infuriating the audience with their opening song but managing to win them afterwards, the band members inadvertently stumble on an incident they weren't meant to witness and are ultimately forced to rely on their instincts in order to survive & alter their sealed fate once they figure out that the club owner wants to sweep everything under the rugs.Written & directed by Jeremy Saulnier in what is only his third feature film, Green Room marks yet another win for the indie filmmaker and is one more quality addition to his short but impressive film career. Just like his previous work, Saulnier relies on the incredibly tense, thoroughly unyielding & steadily elevated atmosphere to deliver the chills and his confident direction plus expert handling of the available resources clearly indicate what a bold, daring & assured talent he is. The script could've used a bit more refinement but it nonetheless gets the job done.The remote location where all the action unfolds quietly brings the element of claustrophobia into the picture while the inhospitable look of the club adds a layer of bleakness to it. Cinematography exhibits clever use of camera, green tint & low lighting to further enhance its grim aura while tight editing ensures that it remains a nail-biting ride for the entirety of 95 minutes by trimming out the fat & leaving behind nothing but a lean story. The background score has a muted presence in the final print, but it's the effective use of silence that uplifts its tense mood to an unbearable level.Coming to the performances, Green Room packs a committed cast in Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots, Alia Shawcat, Joe Cole, Callum Turner & Patrick Stewart, with all of them chipping in with sincere inputs. The punk band members aren't a very likable troupe yet their predicament feels both real & relatable. Yelchin & Poots only get better in their given roles as the plot progresses, Stewart is in top form from the get-go, Macon Blair also has a supporting role, at which he does a very convincing job, and last but not the least, there is a pit bull in the movie that pretty much steals every scene it is in.On an overall scale, Green Room is a skilfully directed, finely scripted, deftly photographed, tightly edited, methodically paced, ably performed & calmly scored cinema that doesn't even try to do anything different with its genre(s) yet what turns it into a relentlessly thrilling experience is the way all its elements come together to work in near-perfect harmony. A delicious slice of violent, unapologetic filmmaking that's armed with knives, guns, machetes, box cutters & some good old- fashioned dog mauling, Green Room is definitely amongst the best films to surface on the silver screen this year. Highly recommended.",Null,4,8,12 July 2016
Public Enemies," Watch It Only For Johnny Depp
","A missed opportunity of sorts, Public Enemies begins strongly but it slows down in the middle and then is never able to catch up or reignite the level of interest that was present earlier in the movie. Made at the time when Johnny Depp was still one of Hollywood's finest & most bankable stars, it's a well-conceived project that was poorly executed in the end.Set during the Great Depression, the story of Public Enemies chronicles the last years of notorious bank robber John Dillinger & his associates, who flourished during a booming crime wave in 1930s Chicago. The plot covers their numerous heists while also focusing on Dillinger's own personal life as they are being pursued by an agent of FBI, which was still in its early years.Co-written & directed by Michael Mann (best known for Heat), Public Enemies recreates the early 1930 era in fine detail and employs the right props & setting to add more authenticity to its overall surroundings. The film opens on an impressive note but the process of juggling different subplots needed a bit more refinement in the script to provide a more compact structure to the narrative.Technical aspects are always on the plus side in a Michael Mann film and Public Enemies isn't any different. There is an incredible amount of detail in every image, which look very crisp by the way, but the pacing issues really hurt it down the line, and improper editing, which allows few moments to run longer than necessary, doesn't help either. The background score works fine but it sure isn't memorable.Coming to the acting department, Public Enemies features a marvellous ensemble in Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Stephen Lang & others, with Depp stealing the show. Outshining everyone with his compelling input & charismatic screen presence, Depp decimates all as John Dillinger and is nicely supported by Cotillard, Crudup & Lang while Bale contributes with a surprisingly wooden performance.On an overall scale, Public Enemies has flashes of brilliance but they are few & far in between. Its 140 minutes runtime feels longer than it should, and it falls pretty short of expectations when it's all over. Capturing its era in a detailed fashion, helmed by an esteemed auteur, and blessed with a stellar cast, it really is a shame because Public Enemies had the ingredients to finish as one of the better crime dramas but instead, it ends up being a forgettable example of its genre. Watch it only for Johnny Depp's outstanding showcase.",Null,2,2,15 October 2013
The Babadook," If It's In A Word Or It's In A Book, You Can't Get Rid Of The Babadook
","An Australian chiller that gets most things right than wrong in a time when almost every other example of its genre is filled with clichés & cheap thrills, The Babadook arrives as a handsomely crafted horror film that presents a welcome absence of jump scares & relies on a chilling sense of dread brought upon by its moody atmosphere to deliver the frights.The Babadook tells the story of a single mother who is still grieving the loss of her husband despite many years having been passed since the tragic incident & is on the verge of falling apart due to her child's behavioural problems & continuous fear of a monster lurking in the house. But very soon, she comes to realize that the monster part may not be all made-up.Written & directed by Jennifer Kent, it was the film's glowing reviews that made me check it out in the first place but it didn't turn out to be scary at all. But unlike most horror films of today, this one touches on some deeper human emotions with a plot that's soaked in symbolism & themes. Cinematography makes really good use of lighting, contrasts & shadows, editing is a mixed bag while music has a mostly muted but effective presence.Coming to the performances, Essie Davis stars in the role of the single mother & her work here is really good as one can make out that her character is going through a lot right from the opening moments. Noah Wiseman plays the annoying kid who ultimately manages to get on everyone's nerves as the story progresses which pretty much explains her mother's dilemma since anyone will go absolutely crazy with a child like that.On an overall scale, despite getting to see such amazing word-of-mouth reception for this film from most people here as well as critics, The Babadook turns out to be an underwhelming cinematic experience for me even though I do admire its effort to try something different with the genre & its take on grief plus creepy ambiance is excellently carried out. Maybe I expected too much but Jennifer Kent's feature film debut is nonetheless a well-crafted chiller worthy of a shot.",Null,3,10,27 November 2014
Bloody Sunday," Powerful, Provocative & Prompting, Bloody Sunday Is Essential Viewing.
","Powerful, provocative & prompting, Bloody Sunday is a meticulously researched, expertly crafted & thoroughly gripping recreation of the Bogside massacre that occurred in the Northern Ireland town of Derry when British troops opened fire on civilians during a protest march, killing 14 & wounding just as many in the process.Dramatising the events that led to the tragic incident on January 30, 1972, Bloody Sunday follows a civil right activist named Ivan Cooper who was the central organiser of the peaceful rally against internment that ended when British army paratroopers began firing on the unarmed demonstrators in full view of the public & the press.Written & directed by Paul Greengrass, the movie sets its foreboding tone right within the opening segment after which it takes a step back to put its pieces on the board but once the stage is set, it explodes & moves forward with stunning immediacy. Greengrass' direction is at its very best when things go south & the whole episode is extensively detailed in the script.Cinematography employs the quasi-documentary-style to film the entire event as it unfolds, thus bringing the viewers right into the conflict, while the frenetic hand-held camera-work further reflects the chaotic nature of such circumstances. Editing is slick for the most part, music is nearly absent and its cast contributes with convincing performances, playing their given roles with utmost sincerity.On an overall scale, Bloody Sunday is a fiercely directed, deftly scripted, viciously photographed, skilfully edited & brilliantly performed movie that brings the dreadful event to life with remarkable precision, brims with intense emotions from start to finish, and not only works as a riveting thriller but also as an unsettling documentary. Disturbing & disquieting but essential viewing nonetheless, Bloody Sunday is strongly recommended.",Null,2,2,27 April 2016

The Danish Girl," Another Oscar Bait From The Director Of The King's Speech & Les Misérables
","Advertised as a 'true story' in spite of being adapted from the fiction novel of the same name, The Danish Girl is an awfully constructed, historically inaccurate & thoroughly lifeless feature film from the director of The King's Speech & Les Misérables and, just like those two period pieces, qualifies as yet another Oscar bait from Tom Hooper.Loosely inspired by the lives of Danish painters Lili Elbe & Gerda Wegener, The Danish Girl narrates a fictionalised account of the two and focuses on their relationship as their marriage & professional lives undergo a complete transformation when Lili accepts herself for who she is and opts for a sex reassignment surgery, thus becoming one of the first recipients of the procedure.Directed by Tom Hooper, The Danish Girl masks itself as a biopic of Lili Elbe yet is more concerned with Gerda's difficulty in coming to terms with her partner's identity. The novel itself discards many known facts about its real-life figures thus rendering them purely fictional characters and yet, the filmmakers choose to not correct the mistakes and still have the audacity to sell it as a true story.The set pieces & costumes are in sync with its timeline, the camera hovers through some beautiful landscapes yet fails to penetrate the hollow people inhabiting this picture, the plot is unnecessarily stretched and while Alexandre Desplat's score is mesmerising, it is more focused on Gerda instead of Lili. Eddie Redmayne does well with what he's asked to play but the finest performance belongs to Alicia Vikander.On an overall scale, The Danish Girl is so full of Oscar bait characteristics that it doesn't even care about getting its facts right and leaves out the elements that may have hurt its chances of winning a few awards. Being advertised as a bold journey of a transgender pioneer, it's a film about straight people despite what it claims to be. A dull, overlong & horribly misguided cinema that's as insulting to the transgender community as it is to the legacy of Lili Elbe, The Danish Girl is worth skipping.",Null,2,3,1 February 2016
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Lacks The Freshness Of Ice Age But Is Still A Roller-Coaster Ride For the Most Part
","The 2nd instalment in the Ice Age series does up the ante when it comes to Scrat's misadventures, introduces new characters into the lives of Manny, Sid & Diego without any friction, and adds more pre-historic animals into its list but it lacks the freshness of the original and is a slight deterioration in storytelling quality as well.The story of Ice Age: The Meltdown continues the journey of Manny, Sid & Diego who embark on a new adventure after finding out that the ice age is nearing its end & with all the melting ice, a great flood is approaching. But on their way to a higher ground, they discover that Manny isn't really the only woolly mammoth left alive.Directed by Carlos Saldanha, The Meltdown carries itself on the momentum provided by previous chapter and packs in enough moments of laughter to keep its audience amused for the most part. The arcs of recurring characters don't really evolve by a notable margin, the story itself follows a generic route & humour is a bit juvenile at times.Scrat is still the best character in the movie and his endless pursuit of the prized acorn is a never- tiring concept that effortlessly provides the comic relief whenever needed. The voice cast of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo & Denis Leary is joined by Queen Latifah & Seann William Scott and all do a fine job at it & play their characters convincingly.On an overall scale, Ice Age: The Meltdown applies the same formula that made its predecessor a refreshing delight yet ends up inferior in content and one reason for that is its inability to improve upon the shortcomings of the first film. However, despite not being as emotionally fulfilling as the original, it delivers on its promise of offering a fun-filled extravaganza.",Null,1,1,15 April 2016
Knives Out," One Of The Best Films Of The Year, And Certainly Amongst The Most Entertaining
","One of the sharpest, smartest & slickest whodunnit murder mysteries that embraces & subverts its genre in equal measure, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is an intelligently plotted & ingeniously directed crowdpleaser that delivers on all fronts, and is all the more bolstered by outstanding performances from its stellar ensemble.By taking the existing template & turning it on itself, Johnson provides his own spin on whodunnit tales and weaves the plot so cleverly that it's always one step ahead of the audience. The story is gripping from the get go, the set up is quick, character introductions are swift, and the juxtaposition of lies & truth offers us a better insight into each character's persona.Johnson's suave direction & sly script further benefits from razor-sharp editing that expertly juggles & interweaves multiple viewpoints into one tightly-knitted structure which is then paced to perfection & never for once loses its momentum. The entire ensemble renders their rich, flavourful characters with finesse. Daniel Craig & Ana de Armas impress the most, with latter's role being the heart & soul of this story.On an overall scale, Knives Out presents writer-director Rian Johnson at the top of his game, and is his finest film to date. An endlessly enjoyable & wildly entertaining cinematic ride that's accomplished in nearly all aspects and features a brilliant cast that nails the brief with effortless ease, Johnson's modern take on the whodunnit is one of the best films of 2019, and certainly amongst the most entertaining.

Oldboy," Laugh, And the World Laughs With You. Weep, And You Weep Alone.
","One of the most shocking & disturbing tales of revenge you are ever going to come across, Oldboy is not only a genre-defining classic that sets a new benchmark for revenge-thrillers to follow which as of today still remains unsurpassed, but is also the finest film to come out from the South Korean film industry & in every way is director Park Chan-wook's best work.Oldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-su, who is abducted on the night of his young daughter's birthday & is held captive in an apartment prison for 15 years, without any clue of why he is there & who has imprisoned him, and is later freed in the same inexplicable manner. Rest of the film is about Oh Dae-su trying to uncover the identity & motives of his captor to exact revenge.Co-written & directed by Park Chan-wook, Oldboy is the second instalment of his Vengeance trilogy, preceded by Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance & succeeded by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance but apart from the central theme of vengeance, every other aspect of this cinema is different from those two chapters for Oldboy tears through the confinements of its genre unlike anything before & is an exhilarating work of art.Ingeniously written & directed, Park brilliantly layers the plot with clever twists & unflinching violence that slowly unravels its mysteries to give the viewers a cinematic jolt they'll have a hard time forgetting. The picture is also exquisitely photographed & meticulously captured by its stylish camera-work. Editing steadily paces the narrative & also adds a grim mood that further enhances the film's dark elements.Production design is stellar work in every manner, visual design is extremely enticing, sound design also plays a relevant role and its background score has a slight retro feel to it plus it happens to be heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time. And while there are a lot of favourite moments to choose from, my favourite is the single long take of the corridor fight scene which in my opinion is one of 21st century's greatest cinema moments.Coming to the performances, it's a trio of terrific performances that elevate its premise with most impressive input coming from Choi Min-sik who simply owns his role of Oh Dae-su & overshadows everything else. Next is Yoo Ji-tae giving us a controlled rendition of the guy responsible for Dae-su's imprisonment. And last we have Kang Haye-jung as Mi-do; Dae- su's love interest who plays a vital role in the film's unpredictable & unexpected finale.On an overall scale, Oldboy is a disturbing, unsettling & violent cinema from South Korea that will traumatize most of its viewers with its harrowing & sickening depiction of revenge but then, there is also no denying that with its remarkable blend of impeccable direction, clever screenplay, arresting photography, tight editing, amazing performances & classic score, it's also one of the greatest films ever made.

","One of the finest sequels ever made and still counted amongst the greatest superhero flicks in existence, Spider-Man 2 is a remarkable follow-up to its already-impressive predecessor that skilfully builds upon the solid foundation provided by the first film, presents significant upgrades in each filmmaking aspect and beautifully balances all its elements to succeed as not just a de-facto standard of its genre but also as one of the best films of its year.Set two years after the events of the first film, the story of Spider-Man 2 finds Peter Parker struggling to balance his personal life & his obligations as Spider-Man. His love interest is engaged to someone else, his grades have been steadily declining and he also seems to be losing his powers. Meanwhile, a brilliant scientist named Dr. Otto Octavius transforms into a supervillain with four robotic tentacles fused to his spine after his effort to sustain a nuclear fusion reaction goes horribly wrong.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man 2 is a far more mature effort from him in comparison to his previous venture and presents the director in sublime form for this sequel picks up the story right where it left off the last time despite the 2 years span, progresses the arc of its reprising characters amazingly well while giving a proper introduction to the new ones, and also does an outstanding job in balancing its storytelling elements with moments of action in a seamless manner, due to which everything about this sequel just works.Alvin Sargent's screenplay is worthy of praise as well for the story takes a darker approach than the last time yet packs in enough humour to prevent it from becoming too bleak, and although the cheesiness of the first chapter isn't reduced, the narrative flow is much more stream-lined than before. Production design team comes up with bigger, more refined set pieces, Cinematography preserves the vibrant camera-work but has a firmer grip on it this time while Editing is definitely one of its strongest aspects for there isn't a dull moment in the picture.Visual effects is much improved as well and by not overdoing its CGI elements, it keeps the artificiality of its universe at bay for the most part. Sure a number of moments are over-the- top but most of them still fall under the realm of on-screen believability. Last but not the least, Danny Elfman delivers again with a splendid soundtrack that stays true to the original film's score, works as a wonderfully evolved successor, and captures the darker tone with finesse just like it did the last time. Even the existing songs used in the picture are nicely chosen & help compliment the respective sequences.Coming to the performances, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco & J.K. Simmons return to reprise their respective roles of Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn & J. Jonah Jameson and do a better job than before. Maguire builds up on his earlier input to impress once again and what he lacks in star presence, he makes up for it by chipping in a complex performance. Simmons is hilarious as before, Dunst & Franco are still on base level but it's Alfred Molina who impresses the most in what is a sympathetic rendition of Doc Ock, thus making him a classic foe in every way.On an overall scale, Spider-Man 2 delivers everything one can expect from a sequel. It goes bigger, better & more action-packed than before yet stays completely true to its origin, plus finishes on a high with enough open choices for where it can be headed in later instalments, something that Sony failed to take advantage of. Sam Raimi has weaved a magical web yet again that tightly grasps on to every necessary ingredient to come up with an incredibly fun, highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly satisfying extravaganza that promises yet another high-flying, web-sligning roller-coaster ride and effortlessly delivers it.",Null,1,3,10 September 2015

The pacing is consistent throughout its 129 minutes of runtime. VFX is rarely noticeable yet its seamless fusion with the film's thoughtful camera-work & clever editing is responsible for a jaw-dropping sequence that would easily go down as one of the greatest scenes ever filmed.Coming to the performances, The Secret in Their Eyes features a committed cast in Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, Guillermo Francella, Pablo Rago & others, and all of them are terrific in their given roles.

The Irishman," Martin Scorsese's Magnum Opus
","A sprawling crime opus that reunites the legends of the craft for one last ride, The Irishman is quite possibly Martin Scorsese's final venture into crime epics and serves as a memorable coda that provides a fitting closure to the genre he popularised. An acting powerhouse led by stellar performances from Robert De Niro, Al Pacino & Joe Pesci, it is easily my favourite of all Scorsese-De Niro collaborations, features the best ensemble of the year, and is arguably the esteemed auteur's magnum opus.",Null,1,7,18 January 2020
127 Hours," There Is No Force More Powerful Than The Will To Live
","Taking a real life incident and concocting an inspiring, gut-wrenching & life-affirming tale around it, 127 Hours is a thoroughly engrossing biopic that retells adventure junkie Aron Ralston's harrowing experience in the Grand Canyon, and benefits immensely from Danny Boyle's kinetic direction & James Franco's riveting performance.The story of 127 Hours follows adventurer Aron Ralston who goes hiking in the Grand Canyon but finds himself stuck all alone in the vast landscape when a boulder falls over his hand. With limited supply of food & water, the plot covers his arduous survival over the next five days as he attempts to free himself with whatever utilities available to him.Co-written & directed by Danny Boyle, the premise is set up real quick as the film establishes the main character's lifestyle in a matter of few minutes before heading straight to the location where majority of the plot unfolds. Boyle approaches the project in a restrained manner yet his direction exudes an energy that keeps the drama compelling at all times.The writing isn't shabby either but there are times when the story indulges in some hallucinations which felt a bit distracting. Camera-work is both dynamic & regulated depending on the scene and the warm colour palette only provides more vividness to the images. Editing is sharp for the most part and A.R. Rahman's excellent score only uplifts the viewing experience.Coming to the performances, 127 Hours is James Franco's show all the way. Carrying the entire picture on his shoulders and playing the role with finesse, Franco delivers a strong, emotional & gripping performance and makes the viewers feel every bit of his agony & frustration resulting from his predicament. It's a marvellous showcase that still remains his career-best work.On an overall scale, 127 Hours is a stylishly directed, finely scripted, wonderfully photographed, brilliantly edited, swiftly paced, mesmerisingly scored & outstandingly acted survival drama that inspires & entertains with amazing balance. One of the best films of its year and certainly a great one in the careers of both Danny Boyle & James Franco, 127 Hours shows that there is no force more powerful than the will to live, and is absolutely worth your time & money.",Null,0,0,15 October 2013
Batman Returns," A Definite Improvement Over Its Predecessor
","A definite improvement over its predecessor, Tim Burton's Batman Returns offers welcome upgrades in several aspects to deliver a darker, stronger & better sequel that digs into its characters' emotional trauma in truly fascinating ways, and is all the more uplifted by its operatic set pieces, smart camerawork, chilling ambience & haunting score.The film this time pits Batman against Penguin & Catwoman but the tragic angle the story takes to progress their arcs is what makes the trio and their interactions so compelling. Its over-the-top action hasn't aged well but the drama still retains its freshness & gripping quality. While it still feels like a product of its time it is at least more entertaining.Although the refined set pieces, sharp imagery, eerie tone & splendid score uplift the look n feel of the whole picture, performances are this time its strongest suit. Michael Keaton is more comfortable as Bruce Wayne, Danny DeVito is fantastic as Penguin but it's Michelle Pfeiffer who steals the show with her sultry rendition of Catwoman. It's a deftly layered act from all three.Overall, Batman Returns is better than Batman in more ways than one and it also appears less dated, thanks to the toned down goofiness. When it comes to action, it is as uninteresting as it was in the previous entry. However, its dramatic depth & emotional beats resonate more strongly this time around, thus making it a worthy successor to the original. If not for anything, watch it for Pfeiffer.",Null,3,7,12 April 2020
Finding Nemo," 'Sea' It to Believe It.
","Marking the biggest leap for Pixar Animation Studios since their groundbreaking debut with Toy Story in 1995, Finding Nemo brings a whole new level of maturity in Pixar's method of storytelling, a new surge in its humour, creativity & imagination, and another elevation in its already unparalleled animation to succeed not only as one of the best films of its genre but is also exceptional enough to be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.Finding Nemo tells the story of Marlin; a clownfish residing in the Great Barrier Reef who's very overprotective of his son, Nemo. When Nemo is captured by scuba divers & taken to Sydney, Marlin sets out on a journey throughout the ocean to find his son, is joined by Dory; an optimistic blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss, encounters many more dangers & adventures and in the process, learns to appreciate life a lot more than ever before.Directed by Andrew Stanton, Finding Nemo is drop-dead gorgeous from the first frame to the last, is crafted with immense care, passion & love, has a surprising level of depth in its story, is filled with characters that are rich, charismatic & colourful, captures ocean life unlike ever before in cinema history, brims with clever use of humour, expertly balances its storytelling aspects with jaw-dropping animation and has something in store for viewers of all ages.It's pretty evident from its presentation that Pixar's production design team did a massive amount of research before animating it on the film canvas, the camera-work is jubilantly carried out & fills the screen with vivid colours. Editing makes sure every single scene plays a relevant role in pushing its story forward & steadily paces its 100 minutes of runtime while Thomas Newman's score makes the whole experience all the more touching, mesmerising & emotionally resonant.The level of precision, sharpness & detailing in its animation is no short of an achievement, every single character is skilfully drawn & rendered whether it's the shark, whale, turtles or jellyfish, and is perfectly voiced by its terrific voice cast. And while everyone shines in their given roles, it's Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who turns out to be the show-stealer for she is without a doubt one of the most optimistic characters to surface on the silver screen.On an overall scale, Finding Nemo is love at first sight. It's a stunning, bewitching, magical, emotionally rich & truly unforgettable cinema that has a lot to say about parenting, friendship, trust & determination and sets a higher benchmark for its genre. One of Pixar's biggest home-runs on critical, commercial & emotional scale, Finding Nemo is a spellbinding underwater adventure that you'll want to experience again n again.

Creed," An Unexpected Knockout, Ryan Coogler's Creed Is The Dark Horse Of This Year!
","In 1976, Sylvester Stallone scripted an underdog tale whose critical & commercial success emulated its very own story for Rocky was hailed by many as the perfect exemplification of the American dream and turned Stallone into a major star. The sequels then began a quality slump and the franchise slowly faded into oblivion until in 2006, Stallone resurrected Balboa for one final round & delivered a knockout that concluded the whole saga on a perfect note, something this cultural icon always deserved.Now Creed, at first, felt like a misstep after Rocky Balboa but Ryan Coogler has pulled off a rare miracle in this era of sequels, prequels, remakes & spin-offs for Creed emerges as the surprise package of this year and is an underdog story for the ages that treats the legacy of Rocky with utmost respect yet has its own identity, thus working as that cinematic moment where the baton is passed from the old to the new. A perfect homage to that quintessential sports drama, Creed has that same old blood flowing in its veins, albeit in a new body.A spin-off from the original Rocky series, Creed tells the story of Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson, the illegitimate child of Apollo Creed, who wants to step into his late father's footsteps and become a professional boxer. Quitting his stable job to pursue his dreams, Adonis moves to Philadelphia in order to get in touch with his father's old pal & rival, Rocky Balboa, and tries to coerce the retired boxing legend to train him. Refusing at first, Balboa eventually agrees to mentoring Adonis but when his real identity is leaked, an unexpected offer arrives out of nowhere.Co-written & directed by Ryan Coogler, who made his breakthrough with Fruitvale Station a couple of years ago, Creed is only his sophomore effort yet it's some leap for this promising new talent for Coogler takes a very risky route by attempting to script the next chapter of a beloved franchise but it all works out amazingly well in the end. The script is as good as his direction for the characters are nicely fleshed out while Rocky Balboa's arc is handled with great care as Coogler approaches his character from a fresh angle. And while a number of parallels emerge between Creed & Rocky, Coogler's film is entirely his own.The technical aspects are skilfully executed & there are plenty of moments that evoke only admiration. With majority of its plot taking place in Philadelphia, its street culture & notable landmarks are sensibly incorporated into the picture. Cinematography is highly impressive for the camera moves around with kinetic frenzy while capturing each moment in splendid detail but the highlight is an entire boxing match shot in one unbroken take. Editing keeps the plot tightly-knitted, provides ample screen time to each character & steadily paces the story. The soundtrack includes a few tracks from the original series but for the most part, it's an original composition.Coming to the performances, Creed features a devoted cast in Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad & Tonny Bellew, and every one of them delivers the goods. Jordan further strengthens his acting résumé with another fantastic performance as Adonis but supporting him on the exact same level is Stallone who reprises his signature role of Rocky Balboa and it's been a while since we've seen him deliver such an emotionally powerful performance. Thompson plays Adonis' love interest but even her character shows some depth, thus making her role a bit more relevant. But it's the terrific chemistry between Jordan & Stallone that steals the show.On an overall scale, Creed is an absolute knockout that borrows the right ingredients from its predecessors, knows where exactly to draw the line, successfully steers its franchise to a new direction, and manages to be just as rewarding for newcomers as it is for fans of the original series. While the boxing matches brim with adrenaline-rush & testosterone-fuelled excitement, the strongest aspect of Creed is the mentor-disciple bond between Adonis & Rocky for it is the core element that makes this movie work on so many levels. With clear understanding of what Rocky was all about, Creed perfectly recycles its source material for the new generation of filmgoing audience and is one of the best films of the year, one of the best sports drama in recent memory & quite possibly the best start there ever has been to a spin-off series. Definitely, delightfully & very highly recommended.",Null,1,4,22 December 2015
The Great Dictator," Charlie Chaplin's Sound Feature Debut
","The first all-talkie, all-sound film from Charlie Chaplin is also the most controversial work of his filmmaking career that presents the revered icon making fun of all things fascism and is a blatant parody of Adolf Hitler & his propaganda. An overly political film from Chaplin, The Great Dictator is considered a classic today but of all the feature-length films that I've seen of his so far, it's also the weakest.Set 20 years after the First World War in the fictional country of Tomainia which was on the losing side, The Great Dictator follows two story lines; first concerning a Jewish barber who suffered memory loss during his service in the war & finds himself under a new oppression after returning home while the other storyline concerns Tomainia's ruthless dictator who is trying to expand his empire.Written, produced, directed & scored by Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator marks his first stint with sound cinema yet Chaplin shows a great level of comfort in what's an unfamiliar territory for him. The timeless elements of his silent classics are present in this picture but Chaplin also employs sound in a manner that adds more weight to his already unparalleled slapstick humour, as evident in Hynkel's speech.The film is usually at its best when there is no dialogue needed or when the spoken words don't make any sense. Chaplin absolutely nails the character of Adenoid Hynkel; the Dictator of Tomainia, and whatever gibberish comes out of his mouth is pure gold. And he's excellently supported by Jack Oakie, who plays Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Benito Mussolini) & they together provide the viewers with the film's finest moments.The technical aspects are refined to the smallest of details, as always the case in most films by Chaplin. The sets are impressive to look at, Camera-work is expertly carried out with long takes, controlled movements & sharp focus. Editing is a slight mishap for some sequences linger on for too long or become repetitive. Humour carries Chaplin's unique trademark but there are a few empty stretches in between. As for the soundtrack, it simply fits.Chaplin also plays the Jewish barber in addition to the dictator and is excellent in that part as well. While the barber character does borrow a few elements from The Little Tramp, it's Hynkel where Chaplin really shines this time. However, what brings the film down for me is what was absent from his earlier features; the voice-over, as Chaplin's narration is annoying & intruding at times, especially when he tries to explain what Hynkel is saying in his gibberish speech.On an overall scale, The Great Dictator may not be as remarkable as Chaplin's finest films but it nonetheless works as an audacious piece of political satire that's superbly filmed & outstandingly performed. It offers an enjoyable ride for the most part, features plenty of amusing moments but lacks the smooth flow & closely-knitted structure of his usual works and although the universal message of the final speech does transcend all races, borders & boundaries, it can also feel a bit preachy. Either way, The Great Dictator comes recommended.",Null,1,3,2 September 2013

The Mummy," One Hell Of A Fun Ride
","The plot holes might be too glaring to go unnoticed but there's also no denying that The Mummy is one hell of a fun ride. Hilarious, swiftly paced, incredibly entertaining & highly enjoyable, the best thing about this amusing flick is that it's very much aware of its limits, nicely plays to its strengths & never tries to sell itself as something it is not.A loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name, the story of The Mummy is set in Egypt & follows an English librarian who enlists the help of an American adventurer to carry out an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra, only to accidentally unleash an ancient curse which had been laid on a dead High Priest, thus awakening him & dooming the fate of all mankind.Written & directed by Stephen Sommers, the premise has an adventurous tone & is shot in a very light-hearted manner. The visual effects are stunning for its time, performances are fair enough although sluggish on few occasions, editing is slick, music is a big plus & the whole picture is wonderfully humoured from start to finish. Now one can find a lot to complain about but it is at least never boring.On an overall scale, The Mummy may not qualify as a great example of its genre(s) but this adventurous tale of a dig gone wrong nevertheless serves its purpose well by delivering a solid, cheerful entertainment that viewers of all ages can sit back & enjoy. Promising an amazing fun ride that's not meant to be taken seriously, The Mummy is definitely worth a shot.",Null,1,1,7 October 2013
Constantine," Settles For Far Less Than What It Was Capable Of
","A fascinating fable of angels & demons with humans caught up in between, Frances Lawrence's directorial debut packs an interesting premise yet is unable to flap its wings due to issues of its own makings. Keanu Reeves' presence is no less than a divine intervention here coz without him, Constantine is very much a hopeless ride.The story concerns a demonologist who has a reputation for dealing with the mystical and has been repenting for his past sins by sending demons back to hell, hoping his good deeds will finally grant him a place in heaven. But when he's approached by a police detective to investigate her twin sister's suicide case, he learns of a conspiracy that threatens all mankind.Directed by Frances Lawrence, the first act is rather impressive & piques our interest with ease while paving the necessary groundwork. But it's unable to keep a firm grip on our attention for long as the plot only gets sillier & goofier with time and goes full bonkers in the finale. It is lacking in atmosphere, has no build-up whatsoever, and is missing the required seriousness.It would've helped if the film had a dark, gothic vibe with skilfully executed moments of tension & suspense. What we get instead is a watered down version of a material with far greater potential. Keanu Reeves' charisma conjures more magic here than his performance but he does enough to keep us around till the end. Tilda Swinton is reliable as always while Rachel Weisz ably plays her role(s).On an overall scale, Constantine has the beginnings of a cool, stylish & thrilling horror-fantasy but the story fails to capitalise on it. Somewhere along the line, the debutant filmmaker loses his grasp on the narrative, resulting in a finished product that settles for far less than what it was capable of. The cult following it has developed over the years may give the impression of it being an underrated gem. For me however, it was nothing but dull, bland & underwhelming.",Null,2,5,19 September 2019

","Shrouded with a thick layer of mystery that cleverly unfolds over the course of its runtime, making excellent use of horror elements to encapsulate the whole film with a tense mood, and further enhancing its dark ambiance by capturing its low-light surroundings in a truly fascinating manner, The Others is one of the most underrated gems of modern horror.Set in Jersey during the aftermath of the Second World War, the story of The Others follows Grace, a religious mother of two children who have a rare disease that makes them allergic to sunlight. When three new servants arrive at their mansion, a series of inexplicable events are set in motion which convinces Grace that there is a mystical presence in the house.Written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar, The Others packs in a highly gripping story that is smartly narrated from start to finish and is able to keep its mystery alive till the very end where it surprises its audience with a shocking revelation. The screenplay is no slouch for the characters & their arcs are elegantly handled and each added element only works out in favour of the story.The old mansion on a seemingly isolated island brings a creepiness of its own. The camera employs minimal use of light, sometimes relying solely on candles & its effervescent glow to capture the drama, and it is effectively carried out. Editing steadily unfolds its narrative. And the performances by its cast is thoroughly convincing, with Nicole Kidman & Alakina Mann impressing the most in their respective role of Grace & her daughter.On an overall scale, The Others is an outstanding piece of horror filmmaking that's patiently crafted, deftly scripted, elegantly shot, brilliantly paced, calmly scored & strongly performed and exhibits a wonderful balance in all aspects to deliver a genuinely chilling experience to its audience. And on the strength of its interesting premise & proper attention to characters, The Others is a welcome entry in the genre of horror that's absolutely worth your time & money.

Dead Poets Society," 'Carpe Diem, Seize The Day. Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May.'
","An inspiring, endearing & emotionally stimulating tale that's further strengthened by a surprisingly down-to-earth performance from Robin Williams, in addition to the spot-on chemistry between its young cast, Dead Poets Society is an affectionately crafted, skilfully directed & smartly scripted work that only asks its viewers to dream more urgently & live more fervently.The story takes place in an all-male prep school during 1959 and follows a group of students who are encouraged to unleash their creative side by their new English teacher, a former alumni of the school. As he inspires them to look at poetry & life with a different perspective, his students restart the unsanctioned Dead Poets Society club and begin challenging the status quo.Directed by Peter Weir, the film introduces all the relevant characters in the opening scene but it takes a while to get acquainted with most of them and separate one from another. However, once their English class begins, and their new teacher's unorthodox methods unlock their true potential, it turns into an enjoyable, entertaining & thoroughly nostalgic drama that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.The atmosphere, for the most part, is infused with a positive, creative & optimistic vibe and all the moments featuring Robin Williams is a delight to watch. The fine dynamic between its young actors makes them convincing as a group, and their individual contribution is no slouch either. Camera is operated in a smooth, static fashion. Editing is controlled, unfolding the narrative at a steady pace, while its score adds flavours of its own into the final print.Coming to the performances, Dead Poets Society features a wonderful cast in Robin Williams, Josh Charles, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Norman Lloyd & others, with Williams impressing the most. It's a finely measured & highly grounded effort from Williams who as John Keating delivers a performance that arguably ranks as his best. And he is brilliantly supported by the rest of the cast who all play their part with flair, both individually and as a group.On an overall scale, Dead Poets Society is a wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama that tries to illustrate the importance of finding one's true passion in life and embracing it wholeheartedly. It packs plenty of laughs over the course of its runtime, and fine dose of tears as well but at its heart, Dead Poets Society is all about making your lives extraordinary. And the only way to do that is by following your heart, pursuing your dreams & continue seizing every day. Delightfully recommended.",Null,0,0,14 November 2017
Brokeback Mountain," Not Only A Fair Portrayal Of Two Men In Love But An Uplifting Story About The Greatness Of Love Itself.
","Profoundly honest, wonderfully crafted, brilliantly performed, beautifully scored & arguably the boldest film I've ever seen, Brokeback Mountain is not only a fair portrayal of two men in love but an uplifting story about the greatness of love itself. The film is amazing to look at, is shot in beautiful locations & director Ang Lee left no stone unturned in fusing this nicely adapted narrative with his calm & controlled artistic flair.But the biggest contribution comes from the strong performances by both Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal. Ledger truly nails his character of Ennis & although he didn't speak much throughout the runtime, his body language effortlessly conveyed everything about Ennis' stuffed up emotions, fears & love. Gyllenhaal plays Jack Twist & delivers a knockout performance and so did Michelle Williams. Anne Hathaway didn't have much to do unfortunately but she was no disappointment.From start to finish, it is a roller coaster ride of powerful emotions & although some moments might be difficult to watch for few people out there but by the time it ends, it will hopefully end up changing many viewers' presumptions about this film or its characters or its theme or even modern society. On an overall scale, Brokeback Mountain isn't only one of those films that will stand the test of time but it's a cinematic gem that will keep resonating the power of thought-provoking cinema in changing viewers' perspectives, forever.",Null,6,6,9 August 2013
Orphan," Chilling, Mysterious & Delightfully Creepy
","A confidently crafted, patiently narrated & brilliantly acted psychological horror that makes terrific use of available resources to create a sense of foreboding, Orphan brings its chilling, mysterious & delightfully creepy tale to life with incredible restraint, and is a much welcome entry in the world of horror that manages to effectively sustain its ominous atmosphere from the first frame to the last.The story of Orphan concerns a couple who are coping with the recent loss of their unborn child, and decide to adopt one from the local orphanage. Enchanted by the grown-up demeanour of a 9- year old Russian girl, they decide to make her the newest member of their family. Things go quite smooth for a while but soon, a series of disturbing events start unfolding in & around their house.Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, whose latest feature film was The Shallows, Orphan places much more emphasis on creating an aura that reeks of mystery & palpable tension rather than relying on jump scares to deliver the chills. Collet-Serra keeps the narrative tight & engaging throughout its runtime, and the script is no slouch either, for its characters are embedded with some personality.Further amplifying its grim tone & unsettling feel is its remote setting & cold surroundings. Camera is expertly utilised on the set and its fluid movements, controlled zooms & sharp focus add shades of its own while the cold colour palette & apt lighting further enhance those images. Editing keeps the pace consistent from beginning to end while John Ottman's muted score silently complements the narrative.Coming to the performances, Orphan features a fabulous cast in Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard & Isabelle Fuhrman, with the ladies stealing the show with effortless ease. Farmiga plays the role of wife & mother in accordance with the scene requirements and contributes with a well-measured input. Sarsgaard does well with what he's given, while Fuhrman is absolutely diabolical in her role and her performance is equally eerie & compelling.On an overall scale, Orphan begins with a nightmarish sequence and concludes on a violent note, but keeps the plot consistently tense & gripping in the middle. The ending isn't entirely satisfying, for it heads into a familiar territory and becomes quite predictable but the positives do outweigh the negatives in this well-made chiller and Isabelle Fuhrman's knockout rendition single-handedly elevates it above your average horror film. Definitely worth a shot.",Null,2,4,18 April 2017
Spotlight," A Compelling Examination Of The Inquiry That Uncovered The Faith-Shattering Scandal Of The 21st Century.
","An extensively researched, skilfully crafted, brilliantly directed, deftly written, tightly edited & outstandingly performed cinema, Spotlight attempts to re-enact the investigation process that led to the uncovering of what became the faith-shattering scandal of the 21st century when it exposed the decades-long history of child molestation incidents within the confinements of the Catholic Church and its continuous cover-up by the Holy institution.Set in Boston around 2001, Spotlight tells the story of the members of The Boston Globe's titular team which comprises of a small group of journalists whose articles are investigative in nature & popular in public. When their new editor asks them to dig more into the column about a pedophile priest & the allegations that the Church was aware of everything yet did nothing, the team begins its research and unearths a pattern of sexual abuses perpetrated by Roman Catholic priests of an unexpected magnitude.Co-written & directed by Tom McCarthy, Spotlight has a clear, concise idea of the direction it's supposed to be headed in and takes a very methodical approach to bring its tale to life by keeping it as close to its real-life source. Although few liberties are taken to enhance the drama, the movie never steps over the line & keeps its characters in check by not glorifying their contribution. The screenplay packs in a gripping plot that grabs the viewers' attention much earlier than expected & never lets go from that point onwards.Production design team does a terrific job with the set pieces by keeping it as authentic as possible, Cinematography exhibits controlled use of the camera to capture all the unfolding set of events, Editing is one of its strongest aspects for there isn't a single dull sequence in the picture plus it's briskly paced, the investigation retains a considerable level of accuracy with the real-life process, Howard Shore contributes with a stimulating score, and all twists n turns are expertly executed plus only end up working in the film's favour.Coming to the performances, Spotlight features a very dependable cast in Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James & others, and every one of them chip in with convincing performances with Keaton & Ruffalo standing out. Keaton delivers yet another top-notch performance after his career was revitalised last year, McAdams also shines in her given role while Ruffalo pretty much steals the show and whether it's the leading or supporting cast, everyone's input is wonderfully balanced.On an overall scale, Spotlight is a highly informative, comprehensively detailed & thoroughly captivating cinema that scores high marks in all departments of filmmaking and manages to work solely on the strength of its script & calibre of its cast, all of which work out amazingly well under McCarthy's direction. An undiluted, uncompromising & honest illustration of the inquiry that brought to light the massive scandal that shook the foundations of the Catholic Church community, Spotlight is undeniably amongst the strongest films of this year, and comes essentially recommended.",Null,0,1,28 December 2015
Terminator Salvation," Loud, Intense & Bombastic But Also Downright Stupid, Hollow & Soulless
","Loud, intense & bombastic but also downright stupid, hollow & soulless, Terminator Salvation is the fourth instalment in the franchise that was already a full circle with two films, before it got dented by an unnecessary third chapter. And although this sequel might be the worst of the series so far, it still makes up for a more entertaining flick than Rise of the Machines.Set 14 years after Judgment Day eradicated much of humanity, Terminator Salvation follows a death row inmate who donated his body for medical research before his execution in 2003 yet happens to be alive in the post-apocalyptic future where he finds himself caught in the war between humans & machines and learns about his upgraded identity after coming face to face with John Connor.Directed by McG, Terminator Salvation is completely devoid of any sort of substance, has no redeeming value despite salvation in its title & is so full of plot holes that the entirety of the picture is one big facepalm moment. But thanks to its vicious pacing, non-stop action, high-definition photography & volatile atmosphere, it also manages to be a relatively fun, entertaining & less tedious affair than the previous entry.The bleak, desaturated look of the post-apocalyptic setting is captured in crisp detail, the screenplay is an absolute mess, visual effects is striking for the most part, CGI-laden action is engaging & ridiculous at the same time, its entire premise doesn't even has any reason to exist, character depth is nil, the final twist explaining one character's fate is laughable, and Danny Elfman's score is disappointing for it adds nothing to its story.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anton Yelchin & Helena Bonham Carter, and everyone is terrible in his or her given roles. Bale hams like never before in the role of John Connor, Worthington does have a few moments to his name, Yelchin takes the role of young Kyle Reese, Dallas Howard is in as Connor's wife & simply exists, and even Bonham Carter chips in with a forgettable input.On an overall scale, Terminator Salvation is an effects-driven sci-fi actioner that features an entirely different setting compared to its predecessors yet not an ounce of logical storyline. The action in the first act is quite intense & interesting but from there on, it's only a downhill process. Nevertheless, I did have an enjoyable time with the action sequences this film had in store & while it's no better in quality than its equally dull predecessor, it's less frustrating to a considerable extent.",Null,1,5,29 June 2015
Insomnia," Arguably... Christopher Nolan's Weakest Film To Date.
","Christopher Nolan's first stint with a major Hollywood studio is a remake of the Norwegian thriller of the same name and is termed by many critics to be one of the rare instances of an American remake done right. I haven't seen the original so I can't compare the two but one can make out that it tries to carve its own identity instead of following the same footsteps.The story of Insomnia concerns Will Dormer; a Los Angeles homicide detective who, along with another detective, is dispatched to a small Alaskan town to investigate the methodical murder of a local teen. When an attempt to apprehend the suspect results in a tragic incident, things soon turn worse for Will as he finds himself being blackmailed by the suspect while his past returns to haunt him.Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film employs a non-linear structure like the director's previous features which manages to engage the viewers further into its story to an extent but never really affects the overall narrative by a great deal. Writing is pretty good, camera-work is carried out in a controlled manner while editing could've chopped off a little more runtime as the film really drags at times.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Al Pacino, Robin Williams & Hillary Swank from whom Nolan is able to bring out convincing performances. Pacino is absolutely committed to his given role though he did go a bit further than required on few occasions, Swank's character doesn't have much to offer, but Williams is surprisingly good in a role that's atypical of him.Despite getting many things right, Insomnia still ends up being a disappointment for it remains stuck at the same level throughout its runtime & never manages to up the ante or build any sort of excitement, even during the climactic moments. Nolan fans are destined to check it out & few might even find something rewarding in it but for me, Insomnia remains a stale cinematic experience & is arguably Nolan's weakest film to date.",Null,0,3,14 October 2013

My Neighbor Totoro," A Cinema You're Going To Cherish All Your Life.
","Magically capturing the beauty & innocence of childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a magnificent example of hand-drawn animation from Studio Ghibli. Set in a rural village in post-war Japan, it tells the story of two little girls who move to a new place with their father so that they can be near to the hospital where their mother is recovering from a long-term illness and covers the little girls' adventures with the wood spirits living in a nearby forest.Directed by world's renowned artist Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro isn't any conflicted or tragic story but is simply a reflection & celebration of life & its little adventures. The childhood of the two girls portrayed here is extremely convincing, the fanciful creatures including Totoro are freshly imagined, the 2D animation mirrors a beautiful painting, the voice actors are lively in their roles & the music is as heartwarming as it is soothing.On an overall scale, My Neighbor Totoro is a nostalgic journey of childhood, an adventure for all ages & a subtle commentary about the depleting relationship between humans & nature. It brings on screen some wondrous creatures of fantasy & yet remains grounded throughout its runtime. A simple, heartfelt & joyous cinema that takes us through little bits of every emotion, My Neighbor Totoro is a cinematic gem that viewers are going to cherish for a long, long time.",Null,0,1,24 April 2014
500 Days of Summer," Not A Love Story But A Story About Love? Yeah, Whatever!
","A hard pill to swallow but people who are friend-zoned actually deserve to be friend-zoned! The world is full of forever-alone guys who walk around with their 'nice guys' tags to keep reminding themselves that they're the nicest people out there and it's an obligation for any girl they have a borderline-psychotic crush on to love them back as a failure to reciprocate the same feelings instantly results in her being termed a 'bitch'.The term 'friend-zone' itself implies that the other person's feelings doesn't matter. If a guy or girl has a huge crush on someone, then that someone is expected to give them a chance even if they don't feel a thing for the former & might not even be interested in the first place. Expecting the other person to like you when you don't even have anything unique to offer is both lame & stupid but most believe in this half-assed philosophy of love and when it fails to work out, they blame that crush for ruining their lives.(500) Days of Summer makes it very clear in its opening note that all the author intends to do here is to take out the frustration of his failed relationship for a total of 95 minutes. And it works because people with broken hearts are wired to instantly latch on to anything that reminds them of their very own predicament and instead of observing the shortcomings of the protagonist, keep looking for the faults in the one who broke the heart. The whole story is a one-sided perspective of love, expectations & relationship dynamics.Chronicling the events in a non-linear fashion, (500) Days of Summer tells the story of Tom Hansen, a trained architect working as a greetings card writer, who's recounting the broken memories of his failed relationship with Summer Finn, the girl of his dreams who dumps him one day in an abrupt manner. The plot keeps jumping from one random day to another and shows the progression of their relationship as well as the subsequent depression that Tom undergoes after the break-up, and concludes with him moving on to a better future.Directed by Marc Webb in what is his feature film debut, the way (500) Days of Summer is narrated is far more refreshing than its content. The film is an honest depiction of the kind of thoughts that surface in mind when one is getting into a relationship or recovering from a bad break-up but it's the movie's clever structure, bright colour palette, hilarious moments, dynamic editing, splendid camera-work & fine use of The Smiths that makes it an enjoyable experience and for the most part, it does quite well on the expectation vs reality graph.Coming to the performances, Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Zooey Deschanel are supposed to be the sorry guy & the bitch respectively and both of them do a neat job at it. Gordon-Levitt is wholly committed to his character Tom Hansen; the hopeless romantic whose life is turned upside down by the girl he's in love with. Deschanel plays Summer who doesn't believe in the existence of true love but does grow closer to Tom until suddenly breaking up with him one day. It's quite easy to call Summer a bitch for what she did to Tom but she is a version of Tom's memory & is intended to be seen that way.On an overall scale, (500) Days of Summer has its highs n lows just like any relationship but it manages to be an interesting sit, thanks to its confident direction, excellent performances & offbeat storyline that brims with fresh energy, plenty of charm & kinetic flair. A story about love as seen from the eyes of an immature guy who fails to grasp the fact that it is he who's the real architect of all his miseries and not the girl who left him, (500) Days of Summer may not rank amongst the usual examples of its genre(s) but it isn't that different either for what separates it is the tenderness & intellect present in the film's execution rather than the guy- centric content it packs in.",Null,0,0,16 August 2015
The Jungle Book," Too Juvenile, Innocent & Sugarcoated For My Taste.
","Disney's adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's legendary book of the same name does filter out the dark tone of its source material in an effort to make it more family friendly and certainly was a cinematic gem of its time but looking back now, it's a tad too juvenile, simple & innocent for my taste.The story of The Jungle Book follows Mowgli, a feral child raised by a family of wolves who is being escorted by Bagheera the panther to his own kind & for his own safety as Shere Khan has returned to the jungle. On their way, they meet Baloo the Bear who takes the young kid under his wing.Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, this is one of those lighthearted, sugarcoated musicals that are in tune with Disney's early animated classics & is clearly aimed at kids. The hand-drawn animation is admirable but the plot becomes repetitive after a while, is slow despite its 78 minutes runtime & nothing interesting ever happens in it.The songs aren't catchy, the dance numbers are distracting, and the overly juvenile portrait makes it a tedious film to sit through. Leaving me bored for the most part & unmoved by everything it had in store, The Jungle Book is a film that very much belongs to its era and the only way I can imagine it working today is on the strength of nostalgia.",Null,2,11,4 May 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," As Enjoyable As It Is Ridiculous!
","From the director of Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow arrives as another disaster movie by Roland Emmerich that discards the science to create its own logic but when taken as a work of fiction, it makes up for one thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying ride, thanks to its impressive set pieces, state-of-the-art visual effects & sustained thrills.The story of The Day After Tomorrow follows Jack Hall; a paleoclimatologist who, based on his research, discovers that the world is on the brink of a major climate shift when extreme weather conditions all over the globe engulf the planet into a super storm which would lead to a new ice age, and covers the daring trek he makes across America to rescue his son who's trapped in New York.Co-written & directed by Roland Emmerich, The Day After Tomorrow is my favourite work of his despite the numerous shortcomings for the plot never stays static, the extreme climate events are over-the-top yet spectacular to look at, the set pieces are meticulously detailed, visual effects is its strongest aspect and while the plot is ridiculous at times, it isn't difficult to follow & unfolds pretty smoothly.Cinematography captures the drama effectively with some nicely employed camera angles while the cold colour tones bring a chilling vibe of its own. Editing provides a brisk pace to the whole narrative, Harald Kloser's score is another positive highlight for the mesmerising tracks seamlessly integrate into the picture and although the performances aren't any great, the cast does whatever they can with their bland characters.On an overall scale, The Day After Tomorrow is an effects-driven flick that one expects from Emmerich and while he is notable for making terrible movies throughout his career, all in the name of popcorn entertainment, this one isn't as bad as they say. I still remember the fond memories of sitting through this picture for the first time, which was over a decade ago, and while it has lost much of its grandeur since then, it still isn't a complete disaster in my eyes.",Null,0,2,14 August 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Satisfactory Conclusion, If Not A Memorable One.
","The third & final instalment of Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy is a bloated & convoluted mess that unnecessarily adds more complexity to the plot by introducing too many characters instead of bringing its pirate mythology to a satisfactory conclusion, lacks the very sense of fun that made its predecessors click so well and is the weakest film of the three.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End continues the events that unfolded in Dead Man's Chest and follows Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann & the crew of the Black Pearl as they team up with the resurrected Captain Barbossa on a quest to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker and then join the other pirate lords to make a final alliance against their common enemy, the East India Trading Company.Directed by Gore Verbinski, there is no denying that At World's End is visually striking but the issues that surfaced in the previous chapter only get worse here for the story features too many new subplots for what was intended to be the series' finale, takes way too much time to get things moving, and also happens to be tediously paced for the most part which makes its 169 minutes of runtime a challenge to sit through.On the technical scale, the film fares much better for the set pieces are grand, impressive & finely detailed. Cinematography is very much in tune with the previous instalments and the camera makes fab use of its angles, movements & colour tones. Editing however is a major step down for the length of its narrative isn't justified at all plus there are many sequences it could've managed without plus a better pace would've definitely benefited the experience.Visual effects continue to make its mark and its use is much more extensive in this chapter, especially in the action-packed moments and of course, the grand finale. And last but not the least is the background score by Hans Zimmer which presents the legendary composer at the top of his game for the soundtrack carries the same epic feel of its predecessor with a melancholic tone seamlessly blended into the narrative and it amplifies the experience by a great deal.Coming to the performances, At World's End brings back the cast of the first two films for one last venture and has a new addition in Chow Yun-fat who plays one of the pirate lords. Johnny Depp's rendition of Captain Jack Sparrow is a mixed bag for there are glimpses of the usual wit & charisma that made him such a beloved character in the first place but his eccentricity is stretched to a point where it almost stopped working and those hallucination scenes are simply unacceptable.The contribution by its supporting cast is all over the place though. Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley do a fine job in their respective roles of Will & Elizabeth, Bill Nighy as Davy Jones has his moments, Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett takes over the role of prime antagonist of the series, Naomi Harris' character gets a major expansion in this chapter yet the finest work comes from Geoffrey Rush whose Captain Barbossa is the only character who shows no loss in form and is absolutely thrilling to watch.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End joins the long list of second sequels that failed to capture the magic of its predecessors and while not as rewarding as expected, it still ends the trilogy on a satisfactory level thanks to its final hour that redeems much of what was wrong with the picture with an effects-laden & action-packed finale even if it seems quite over-the-top. Enjoyable in bits n pieces, entertaining in the second half but also marred by useless twists, At World's End nonetheless packs in a few thrills & spectacle to bow out on a slightly fulfilling note, if not a memorable one.",Null,0,1,17 July 2015

X-Men," An X-cellent Transition From Comic Books To Silver Screen
","A promising start of the X-Men universe on the silver screen, X-Men is a fascinating work of science-fiction & a terrific addition to the superhero genre film. This is the first time I've watched this film & now I'm wondering what the hell actually stopped me from checking this out in the first place. The only other X-Men film I've seen is X-Men: First Class & if it wasn't for its upcoming sequel which brings back the cast from the original trilogy, I wouldn't have bothered to give this one a chance & would've again missed what actually is a pretty good film.Set in a not so distant future in which few people around the world are mutants; possessing superhuman powers that has also resulted in them being outcasted by the society, it tells the story of two mutants named Wolverine & Rogue who find themselves in between the ongoing battle between two mutant groups; X-Men is led by Professor Charles Xavier; who believes that mutants & humans can co-exist, while the Brotherhood of Mutants is led by Magneto; who believes that humans will never accept the mutants & will always fear them.The direction by Bryan Singer provides this franchise the kickstart it needed & Singer makes sure that the story is easily absorbed by even those who were never aware of Marvel's X-Men comic books. The writing also is nicely carried out with fine introduction of its mutant characters & is detailed with enough information for the first chapter. The film features a strong cast in Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry etc but it's Jackman who impresses the most as Wolverine, followed by composed performances from Wilson & McKellen.The story is nothing great as per se but it does provide the start it needed, the action sequences are nicely carried out although there are few VFX moments that look dated & unintentionally funny now, most of the characters present in the film are intriguing, especially Mystique about whom I would love to find out more. The music however is a let down & the overall production design manages to work just fine.

Spider-Man 3," Weakest Of The Three But Still Better Than The Amazing Spider-Man Films
","The third & final instalment in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Spider-Man 3 is an absolute trash that gets every single thing wrong from start to finish and it's difficult to believe that it is from the very filmmaker who brought this Marvel Comics character on the film screen in a truly fascinating manner and then went on to raise the bar for superhero flicks with an even more superior sequel.Set months after the events that transpired in the previous chapter, the story of Spider-Man 3 follows Peter Parker who has finally managed to balance his two lives which is once again thrown into turmoil when new threats arise. Harry Osborn is after him to avenge his father's death. A petty criminal & real killer of Parker's uncle is transformed into Sandman following a freak accident while an alien symbiote brings out Peter's dark side after bonding with him.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man 3 is marred by numerous things that were never going to work in its favour. Too many subplots, overdose of characters, complex narration, whole lot of plodding, terribly handled character arcs, weak villains, half-assed attempt at humour & too much melodrama definitely account for its downfall but Raimi's inability to balance all the various aspects into one complete whole is what hurt it most for the directed messes up real bad this time.Most of the technical aspects aren't much of an issue but they fail to work in harmony with each other. Set pieces & camera-work is good, Editing is simply horrible for the plot is highly convoluted in its own mess, Visual effects feature more CGI shots than previous films and many of these effects heavy sequences aren't refined enough to hide the artificial elements, and Christopher Young replaces Danny Elfman as the film's composer and even his music, just like other plot elements, is all over the place.Coming to the performances, the cast of Spider-Man 3 comprises of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, J.K. Simmons & others with Topher Grace, Thomas Haden Church & Bryce Dallas Howard being new additions, and all of them deliver forgettable performances. The character arc itself is poorly written for both the new & returning cast and the actors fail to add any interesting dimension to it. None of the villains are intimidating, including Venom who's given a much too less screen time to leave any impression.On an overall scale, Spider-Man 3 is without a doubt the weakest of the three films and also ranks amongst the worst sequels ever made. The whole movie gives an impression of being shot in a hurried manner during production with both cast & crew having no idea of where it is supposed to be headed, Raimi's direction lacks the energetic vibe that made his previous two features such a fun & enjoyable ride and every single aspect seems to be lost in its own realm for none of these elements come together to provide the much-needed smooth flow to this unnecessarily convoluted mess.P.S.

","A masterwork of heartfelt grace, endless warmth & soulful compassion, Children of Heaven is an affectionately crafted, tenderly structured & wonderfully performed coming-of-age drama that not only paints a beautifully evocative portrait of siblings relationship but also offers a very captivating glimpse into the lives of lower-class Persian society.Set in an impoverished neighbourhood in Tehran, Children of Heaven concerns a young boy whose routine is thrown off-balance after he misplaces a pair of shoes that belonged to his sister. Promising to make up for the loss and requesting her to not mention the incident to their parents, the two devise a scheme to solve the problems on their own in the meantime.Written & directed by Majid Majidi, the film features a very simple premise which is then brought to life in a very humane & humble manner. Despite the poor neighbourhood setting, the story doesn't have an ounce of cynicism in it, for all Majidi is concerned with is illustrating the siblings bonding & their shared predicament after the shoes go missing. It's pure, kind-hearted & delightfully sweet.Set pieces are kept to a minimum, plot is firmly rooted in reality, and there is a very naturalistic feel to how its events unfold. The two kids play their part very convincingly and are finely supported by the rest of the cast. Pacing is steady throughout its runtime, and keeps its childhood spirit alive till the very end. And its blissful tone & adorable quality is further amplified by its mesmerising score.On an overall scale, Children of Heaven is an exquisite, nostalgic & intimate cinema that captures the essence of childhood in full-fledged fashion and brims with heartwarming themes that reflect the goodness in humanity. An adorable, innocent & refreshing delight that begins on an arresting note and culminates on an emotional high, this Persian gem is absolutely worth your time & money.

Midnight in Paris," Midnight In Paris Is Paris, As Seen Through The Eyes Of A Hopeless Romantic.
","Whimsical, witty & wonderful, Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a heartwarming blend of romance, fantasy & nostalgia that finds the legendary filmmaker in terrific form, is regarded by many as one of Allen's finest works in recent memory, and is an exquisitely photographed, pleasantly narrated & delightfully amusing tale that's further strengthened by its cast's sincere inputs.The story of Midnight in Paris follows a Hollywood screenwriter who is struggling to finish his first novel. Vacationing in Paris with his fiancé's & her parents, he finds himself transported back to the 1920s while wandering through the city's streets one night and embarks on a journey to the heart of the city where lies the ultimate source of inspiration for his writing.Written & directed by Woody Allen, Midnight in Paris serves as his love letter to the city's heritage and the opening montage that captures the beautiful locales of Paris is something that viewers are instantly going to fall in love with. The story radiates the usual charm & warmth of an Allen film, is sensibly scripted & gleefully humoured, and pays a heartfelt tribute to Paris' rich history, literature & wonders.Shot entirely on location, the background is always brimming with bright, warm colours and even in night segments, the lighting aspect of its cinematography is deftly utilised. The transition from one era to another is smooth, the plot is simple & accessible, Editing unfolds all events in a streamlined fashion, set design team does a brilliant job to bring those bygone eras to life, and the background score is complimentary.Coming to the performances, the movie features a vibrant cast in Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, Michael Sheen, Tom Hiddleston & others. Wilson is unexpectedly impressive and does a brilliant job at both playing his part & narrating the whole story. McAdams also does well with what she's given. But the best of them all is Marion Cotillard who steals her moments with effortless finesse.On an overall scale, Midnight in Paris is an affectionately crafted, exuberantly photographed, aptly performed & nonchalantly humoured cinema that's original, mesmerising & evocative for the major portion of its runtime and will not only enthral Woody Allen's fans but will cast its spell on even the most casual filmgoers, hopefully. An invigorating adventure, a touching romance & a resourceful fantasy, Midnight in Paris is Paris as seen through the eyes of a hopeless romantic.",Null,0,0,26 July 2016
Zodiac," David Fincher's Most Matured Film To Date.
","One of the finest mystery-thrillers you're ever going to come across, David Fincher's Zodiac is a masterwork of meticulous research, painstaking craftsmanship & precision detailing which approaches the police-procedural sub-genre in an incredibly authentic manner, plus the level of accuracy it manages to maintain with the real-life investigative process turns it into an instant classic right away.The story of Zodiac focuses on the manhunt for the notorious serial killer whose killing spree occurred around the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s to early 1970s & who used the alias 'Zodiac' in his letters to press, which also included ciphers. The film covers the life of investigators & reporters who become obsessed with the case in their search for the murderer.Directed by David Fincher, Zodiac presents the renowned filmmaker at the creative height of his illustrious film career & is amongst his finest works for the effort he puts into the smallest of details in order to keep the story as authentic to real life as possible is worthy of praise. Equally fascinating is James Vanderbilt's screenplay who does a stellar job in adapting the story from the non-fiction book it is based on.Coming to the technical aspects, production design team does a magnificent job in recreating the 1970s settings, Cinematography encapsulates the film with a dark ambiance, muted colour tones & perfect lighting, Editing is carried out so well that its 167 minutes of runtime is hardly felt, the film makes use of visual effects but it's rarely noticeable & the background score as well as songs used feel perfectly apt to its scenario.The cast comprises of Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo & others, and their work is impressive as expected. Gyllenhaal turns in a fantastic performance as Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working at San Francisco Chronicle who becomes increasingly obsessed with the case of Zodiac killer, Downey Jr. plays crime reporter Paul Avery, while Mark Ruffalo is assigned the role of Dave Toschi; the lead investigator on the case.One thing I absolutely adore about Zodiac is that it presents its case to the viewers in the exact same manner it is presented to its characters & before you know it, you're already trying to connect the dots like Graysmith. There's no denying that it is a sinister film yet there's plenty of morbid humour to be found here, plus there's also one particular sequence where the tension is far more unbearable than imaginable & you'll know when you get there.On an overall scale, Zodiac is an aesthetic blend of quality direction, impeccable screenplay, perfect digital cinematography, clever editing, convincing performances & fitting score that also remains Fincher's most matured work to date. Despite being a long dialogue-driven story, it is able to lure the viewers in & keeps them transfixed on the screen throughout its runtime plus its emphasis on realism & accuracy to its timeline makes it all the more admirable.As informative as any documentary can be on the same subject matter, as entertaining as any big-screen spectacle is capable of despite its lack of action & precisely capturing the timeline its story is set in, especially when it comes to the technology that was available to the police, Zodiac is a cutting-edge example of its genre which presents David Fincher in prime form & isn't just one of the best films of its year, but is great enough to rank amongst the most accomplished works of 21st century cinema.",Null,1,1,8 January 2015
The Prestige," The Secret Impresses No One. The Trick You Use It For Is Everything.
","An ingeniously crafted tale of twists & turns, a fascinating vignette of obsession & jealousy, and an interesting illustration of friendship & rivalry, The Prestige is a magical piece of thrilling cinema by Christopher Nolan which comes with its own set of pledge, turn & prestige moments just like any great magic trick and cleverly manages to take its ordinary premise & turn it into something truly extraordinary.The Prestige is the story of a friendship that became a rivalry which later turned deadly. The plot concerns two renowned stage magicians in London near the end of the 19th century who engage in competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate illusion but their increasing obsession to best each other's tricks eventually leads them on a path which culminates with devastating consequences.Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film presents the master director in sublime form & is quite possibly the most creative work of his film career. He might have upgraded to making only big- budget blockbusters ever since but this is where Nolan's talents as a filmmaker are at its most bare. Each element is carefully processed & cleverly integrated into the picture and the final pay- off is as satisfying as it is spellbinding.The screenplay marks the first collaboration between Nolan brothers & is deftly adapted from the novel of the same name. Art direction wonderfully brings late 19th century London & Colorado to life, Cinematography captures every moment in clear, crisp detail while also making extensive use of hand-held shooting & cold colour temperatures, Editing is the film's finest aspect without a doubt while composer David Julyan chips in with a fitting score.Coming to the performances, The Prestige features a star-studded cast in Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall & Michael Caine, and they're all pretty convincing in their given roles with Jackman & Bale impressing the most as two rival magicians. Even Caine's character plays a significant part here unlike his supporting roles in other Nolan films. And Johansson does a good enough job playing both pawn & player in the featured rivalry.On looking back, what's even more astonishing is that everything we want to know is right in front of us. From its opening moments, the film keeps dropping obvious hints about its mystery yet successfully manages to create an illusion of hiding a big secret. And just like those people amongst the audience waiting to be amazed by an upcoming magic trick, we fail to see it because we're not really looking. Because just like them, we want to be fooled.On an overall scale, The Prestige is one of the finest achievements in the directional career of Christopher Nolan that intertwines its three acts of storytelling with three acts of illusion in a highly rewarding manner to deliver a cinematic experience that's magical in every sense of the word. An immensely compelling take on obsession, rivalry, secrecy, sacrifice & duality, The Prestige is that great magic trick which viewers won't soon, if ever, be able to recover from.

","One of the most original, influential & greatest examples of sci-fi actioners to surface on the silver screen, The Terminator is a masterwork of quality storytelling & passionate filmmaking that brims with unique ideas, clever imagination, relentless creativity, compelling characters & state-of-the-art craftsmanship, and is also notable for launching the filmmaking career of James Cameron while solidifying the star power of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Hollywood.The Terminator follows its titular character; an unstoppable & indestructible cyborg assassin from the future who is sent back in time to terminate Sarah Connor; a young waitress in the present day whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines in the post- apocalyptic future. Also arriving from the same future into the present world is Kyle Reese; a soldier whose only mission is to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminator at all costs.Written & directed by James Cameron, The Terminator marks a remarkable breakthrough for the then-new filmmaker into the Hollywood industry & wonderfully showcases his excellent understanding of what constitutes a great cinema. It's astonishing how amazingly well this film has aged over the years despite its low budget plus what Cameron manages to put up on the screen on that allowance only speaks volumes about his sweeping cinematic vision, creative ability & precision eye for detail.Coming to the technical aspects, I've got nothing but praise for this film. The special effects team does a terrific job in bringing to life what is a frightening portrait of a post-apocalyptic future & it looks incredibly convincing on the screen. A few effects do appear slightly dated but it doesn't affect the whole experience by any means. Cinematography makes smart use of camera in sustaining the film's tense ambiance from start to finish while Editing unfolds the story at a brisk pace & is at its best during the action sequences.As far as acting department is concerned, The Terminator features an interesting ensemble in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton & Michael Biehn, and all 3 of them have done an outstanding job in their given roles. Biehn balances himself well as Kyle Reese, Hamilton's character arc is most rewarding for we see her going from a vulnerable victim to accepting her fate & fighting for her survival, but the real star of the film is of course Schwarzenegger in the role of Terminator; who is now ranked amongst cinema's most iconic characters.Requiring minimum amount of dialogues & a physical built that's imposing n intimidating at the same time, the role of the Terminator was tailor-made for Schwarzenegger's talents and he absolutely nailed it with his mute expressions, automated dialogue delivery & machine- like movements to give life to an antagonist that's simply invincible. Last but not the least, the background score by Brad Fiedel is an underrated gem in itself whose main theme has easily become one of the most recognizable tracks in existence today plus it compliments the whole narrative in a fascinating manner.On an overall scale, The Terminator is one of the best films of the 1980s that has exquisitely endured the test of time, is a landmark achievement of its genre that continues to inspire & influence films even today, and is one of the proudest works in the career of both Cameron & Schwarzenegger. Unforgettable for its contribution to pop culture, immortal for its lasting influence on science-fiction & action filmmaking, and significant for enriching the film world with a master storyteller who would go on to script an unparalleled legacy of his own in his later films, The Terminator is an undeniable classic in every sense of the word.",Null,1,1,23 June 2015
Cloverfield," Fails To Live Up To Its Hype!
","Taking the concept of a monster film & applying it in the found footage subgenre of horror, Cloverfield is considered by many to be amongst the better examples of modern horror yet the story it packs in is quite generic, the characters inhabiting its world aren't worthy of any emotional investment and much of the movie is redeemed by its frenetic camera-work, smart editing & chaotic ambiance.Set in New York City, Cloverfield follows a group of friends who are throwing a going-away party for one of theirs before the entire city is shaken by an apparent earthquake. Going out to investigate, they find that the situation is far worse than imagined for Manhattan is being razed to the ground by a gigantic monster. The plot then covers their peril as they attempt to get out of the city but first have to rescue a close friend who's trapped in her building.Directed by Matt Reeves, Cloverfield opens on a calm note but once the monster surfaces in the town, a frenzied energy takes over the screen and Reeves does well in retaining the intensity from that point onwards. Written by Drew Goddard, the plot outline & how all of it is supposed to unfold is taken care of quite well but the characters aren't interesting at all and one of them easily manages to get on the nerves for he was incapable of shutting up.The hand-held camera-work is finely carried out, the warm colour palette fits the narrative, its 85 minutes of runtime flies by once the main plot surfaces, VFX is kept to its minimum for we don't see the monster in its entirety but only in bits n pieces and also notable is the fact that the filmmakers chose to not explain the monster's origin & other stuffs, thus giving its viewers something to ponder about once it all finishes while the performances from its cast is mediocre at best.On an overall scale, Cloverfield definitely has a few interesting things going on which work out in its favour but for the most part, it remains an underwhelming experience that fails to replicate the excitement its earlier hype generated. Stylishly directed, making effective use of shaky cam & brimming with 9/11 references but also marred by poor characterisation, some terrible lines & a highly annoying input from the guy holding the camera, Cloverfield isn't as special as many have called it to be but it nonetheless makes up for an entertaining ride.",Null,2,2,22 October 2015
Sleepy Hollow," Another Impressive Collaboration Between Tim Burton & Johnny Depp!
","Marking the third collaboration between a filmmaker who's always been fascinated by dark, Gothic tales & an actor who has a penchant for playing eccentric characters, Sleepy Hollow is a terrific blend of horror & comedy that plays to the strength of both Tim Burton & Johnny Depp and is further improved by its stunning visual design, clever casting & eerie ambiance.Set at the turn of the 19th century, Sleepy Hollow tells the story of a police constable who favours forensic techniques over traditional methods when it comes to solving a case and accepts the alternative to imprisonment which requires him to travel to the village of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate a series of murders, believed to be carried out by the mythic Headless Horseman.Directed by Tim Burton, Sleepy Hollow packs in one of those stories that this director likes to translate on the silver screen and he does a really good job here. Its aptly twisted story exhibits the look n feel of a dark & disturbing horror but in actuality is far more light-hearted than expected. The technical aspects are expertly executed for the most part, with its visual design being an impressive highlight.Production design team does a stellar job with the set pieces and even the timeline this film is set in is nicely recreated on the film canvas. Cinematography is truly bewitching and the use of smokes, minimal lights & monochromatic colour tones provide a highly Gothic feel to the whole picture. Editing could've been better for there were a few segments it could have done without while Danny Elfman's score brings an energy of its own.Coming to the acting department, Sleepy Hollow features a splendid cast in Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson & others with Depp impressing the most. Getting under the skin of his character from the get go, he is very much in command here and his magnetic screen presence further helps his role while Ricci & others provide good supporting performances in their given roles.On an overall scale, Sleepy Hollow is an incessantly Gothic chiller that's brilliantly directed, finely written, gorgeously photographed, faithfully scored & nicely performed and presents both Burton & Depp in superb form. The scare factor is very much diminished by its quirky humour & comical effects but the ghostly atmosphere nonetheless plays an important role in sustaining its ominous vibe throughout its runtime. Delightfully recommended.",Null,1,2,22 October 2015
Hotel Rwanda," Whoever Saves One Life, Saves the World Entire.
","Based on the true events of the massacre that took place in Rwanda during its civil war, Hotel Rwanda is a tale of how a simple man went too far & risked his own life to save as many people as he possibly could even when he had the chance to simply walk away unharmed. It's a disturbing, violent film that also shows how the entire world deserted this nation when it needed them most. Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who housed thousands of people in his hotel & his performance was, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the strongest of the decade and he single-handedly carried this film throughout its runtime and was brilliantly aided by other supporting actors. On an overall scale, Hotel Rwanda is a sad, disturbing, heartfelt tale of loss & genocide but also a very important film. Like Schindler's List, it shows that nothing is more valuable than a human life and just like Oskar Schindler, it shows a compassionate human being who stood up against all odds to save a race from complete annihilation. Highly Recommended.",Null,0,0,11 October 2013
Ready Player One," Pure Spielberg Magic
","Jam-packed with overwhelming nostalgia & countless references to pop culture of 1970s & onwards, Ready Player One marks Steven Spielberg's return to the genre he single-handedly revolutionised with his sweeping cinematic vision and presents the cinematic game-changer in sublime form as his latest is another larger-than-life extravaganza.The story of Ready Player One takes place in the year 2045 where people regularly visit a virtual reality universe called OASIS in order to escape the desolation of their real lives. The plot revolves around the contest that was announced after the death of OASIS founder, the winner of which will inherit the full ownership & control of the virtual universe.Directed by Steven Spielberg, it's been a long time since a film of his has been this fun, adventurous & freewheeling. Infused with a sense of warmth, wonder & magic that only he can provide, Ready Player One sets its premise by giving an overview of the fundamentals of OASIS with speed & clarity. Every frame is a pop culture galore yet Spielberg makes sure that his film has its own identity.Production design team brings OASIS alive in meticulous detail and the navigation through it is smooth & effortless. While the first race sequence offers an adrenaline high & jaw-dropping thrills unlike anything in recent years, one particular standout is the film's tribute to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, ingeniously recreating the setting, mood & atmosphere of that horror masterpiece right down to a tee. Cinematography operates the camera with kinetic flair for scenes set in the OASIS while events taking place in real world are drenched in cold, desaturated palette to further reflect the dismal world its inhabitants are living in. Editing isn't perfect when it comes to interweaving the drama unfolding in two worlds but the pacing is terrific. 
Instead of Spielberg's long-time collaborator John Williams, we have Alan Silvestri composing the score and he does well to fill up the void.Also worthy of mention are its spectacular visual effects without which Ready Player One wouldn't exist. And as always is the case with a Spielberg film, every VFX shot is exquisitely refined, seamlessly integrated & never feels out of place. Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Mark Rylance, Ben Mendelsohn & others, and though there are no standouts, all of them do well with their live-action roles as well as their respective OASIS avatars.On an overall scale, Ready Player One is an endlessly captivating, entertaining & satisfying sci-fi adventure that effortlessly succeeds as an awe-inspiring ode to the genre that cemented Spielberg's own legacy, a heartfelt love letter to cinema, and one nostalgia trip that you may want to revisit again n again. One of the finest films of the year so far, Steven Spielberg's latest is pure escapist bliss in every sense of the word and a cinematic gem for anyone & everyone.

The Hateful Eight," A Vicious, Violent & Venomous Western That May Be Quentin Tarantino's Bleakest Film To Date
","A wickedly gripping, strangely alluring & downright hysterical blend of The Thing & Reservoir Dogs, the 8th film by Quentin Tarantino is another impressive showcase of his remarkable storytelling ability, is shot in glorious 70 mm format that gives it a grandiose look n feel, is all the more strengthened by an outstanding ensemble, and also happens to be the first Tarantino film to feature an original soundtrack, composed by none other than the legendary Ennio Morricone in what is his first composition for a western in over 34 years.Set in post-Civil War America, The Hateful Eight follows John Ruth who's taking fugitive Daisy Domergue to Red Rock alive in order to see her hang & collect the substantial bounty on her. On their way, they encounter another bounty hunter who's seeking a ride to the town. They are soon joined by one more fellow who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock. But when their journey is cut short by a severe blizzard, the group is forced to take refuge in a stagecoach cabin where they meet five more people who may or may not be what they claim to be.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, the story of The Hateful Eight is covered in 6 chapters, with all but one unfolding in chronological order. The whole picture is his homage to John Carpenter's horror masterpiece, sharing many similarities with that classic and despite that, it's wholly original in content, is overloaded with Tarantino's patented trademarks, and is presented as a western to its audience. The screenplay puts greater emphasis on the characters inhabiting this tale and is another winning material from the master storyteller, even if it's a tad too full of itself.Where Tarantino succeeds is in establishing an effective claustrophobic ambiance that brims with palpable tension & persistently looming paranoia. The interplay between characters in a Tarantino feature is almost always interesting and The Hateful Eight is no exception for it has a firm grip on viewers' attention from the start but there are also a few moments when its narrative starts feeling like it is stretched too much to fit its daunting runtime. No one blends violence & humour as ideally as Tarantino does but thanks to the bleak tone of the story, the balance is slightly off in his latest feature.The majority of the plot unfolds in Minnie's Haberdashery, the stagecoach lodge, and the production design team does a commendable job in filling that place up with props that are in tune with its timeline while the snow-covered surroundings steadily bring in the element of isolation. Cinematography is truly epic in both the staggering details of the images filmed in 70 mm format as well as the extreme widescreen aspect ratio it employs to narrate its tale while the cold colour tones, smart lighting, clever angles & slow but fluid movements of its camera help a lot in enhancing the story's unnerving atmosphere.Coming to the performances, The Hateful Eight features a terrific ensemble in Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walter Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern & Demián Bichir, all playing characters that are downright despicable, deceitful & driven by hate. Russell nonetheless turns out to be quite charismatic in his role of John 'The Hangman' Ruth and is brilliantly supported by Jackson & Goggins who play the bounty hunter & sheriff, respectively. However, of all the hateful people, the most memorable performance comes from Jason Leigh for she's absolutely manic as Daisy the fugitive plus her chemistry with Russell is absolutely spot-on.And yet, despite getting most things right, Quentin Tarantino's latest is marred by a few drawbacks. First, the story he's written doesn't live up to the grand canvas it makes use of. Second, its 167 minutes of runtime isn't justified for many moments feel unnecessarily stretched just to accommodate for its intimidating length. Third, Tarantino's own cameo as narrator doesn't fit. Fourth, the excess self-indulgence nearly destroys some sequences, that 'Red Apple tobacco' wink being one example. Fifth, the first half feels like a chore due to the slow pace & character introductions but the film picks up amazing well in the remaining half to correct that particular issue. And there's one more!The Hateful Eight marks the first time in Tarantino's filmmaking career that he has made use of an original score instead of incorporating different tracks into one eclectic soundtrack. Music has always played a key role in every Tarantino film and it's one aspect he's very careful with for it can make or break a picture. Now, Ennio Morricone does deliver on that expectation with a full-fledged soundtrack that's moody, ominous & totally fits the narrative's themes but the groovy element that Tarantino's own musical choices brought into those sequences, acting as an antidote to the gruesome violence being perpetrated on the screen while at the same time contributing to the roller-coaster experience, is somewhat missing.On an overall scale, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is a vicious, violent, vibrant, vindictive & venomous western spewing poisonous hatred all over its frames, is another biting critique of United States' blood-soaked history, and is possibly the bleakest film he's made to date. The narrative scores high marks in quality but it's also blemished with few shortcomings that could've been avoided. Starting on a slow note, the film does manage to redeem itself with a nail-bitingly tense second half and finishes on a satisfactory note yet the whole experience of sitting through this western epic isn't as rewarding as some of Tarantino's finest works. Ingeniously directed, skilfully scripted, gorgeously photographed, patiently edited, methodically scored & superbly performed by its stellar cast, The Hateful Eight is another compelling cinema from Tarantino that's destined to please his fans.",Null,3,12,5 February 2016
"I, Tonya"," A Well-Crafted Biopic Whose Only Plus Point Is Margot Robbie's Show-Stealing Performance
","Powered by knockout performances from both Margot Robbie & Allison Janney, I, Tonya brings the story of one of America's finest figure skaters to cinematic life in a stylish fashion but the impact of its emotionally resonant moments is rendered null by narrative choices that simply don't work together.I, Tonya tells the story of Tonya Harding, the first American woman to successfully land a triple axel in figure skating competition, and covers her ice skating journey from childhood to the controversial incident that ended her career for good. The plot also focuses on the abusive relationships that were part of her personal life.Directed by Craig Gillespie, the film employs narrative techniques like interviews shot in mockumentary style & fourth wall breaking but the only time it manages to be gripping is when our protagonist is on the ice rink. Her abuse at the hands of her mother & husband is disturbing to watch yet most of the time, it is played for laughs.Add to its off-putting humour, most characters in it are just spiteful. And though it gives us more reason to root for Tonya, the terrible choices she keeps making all her life only makes us question our investment in her journey. It's a tragic tale but it isn't treated right, or with respect, thus resulting in a movie that only impresses in bits n pieces.The white trash community isn't illustrated from any new angle. Camerawork is at its best when capturing Tonya doing what she does best. Pacing isn't an issue for the most part but a tighter editing could've resulted in a more compact structure. The stunt team that performed or choreographed the skating moments deserves kudos. And its musical choices are unusual yet fitting.Many moments are shot in a way so as to appear strikingly similar to the real-life footage and it also offers a number of takes on the scandal that eventually led to Tonya being banned from the sport. Filled to the brim with bums, there is nothing to like about any of the supporting characters plus they get way more screen time than required in the final print.Coming to the performances, I, Tonya is spearheaded by Margot Robbie's show-stealing performance as she plays her physically & emotionally demanding role with finesse and is at her absolute best during the final act. Much is made about Allison Janney's input but for me, it's Robbie who impresses the most. Sebastian Stan, however, plays a loser with effortless ease.On an overall scale, I, Tonya is a well-crafted biopic that could've been much more than what the filmmakers ultimately settle for. The various subplots aren't always aligned in the same direction, resulting in a narrative flow that isn't streamlined at all. It is entertaining and will manage to keep the audience around till the end but its fragmented structure hampers the film's prospect of being counted amongst the better examples of its genre(s).",Null,0,0,14 March 2018

The Adventures of Tintin," Underwhelming!
","From the filmmaker who has enriched the world cinema with some of the most adventurous, dazzling & unforgettable films ever made, The Adventures of Tintin marks a couple of firsts for Steven Spielberg. In a massively successful career that spans 4 decades, it's his very first foray into the medium of animation & also marks his first stint with digital filmmaking.Based on the immensely popular comic book series by Hergé, the story of The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn follows the fearless journalist Tintin, his pet dog Snowy & the permanently drunk Captain Haddock who together set off on an adventure to unearth the secret of a ship that sank 300 years ago & was once commanded by one of Haddock's ancestors.Co-written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright & Joe Cornish, produced by Peter Jackson and directed by Steven Spielberg, The Adventures of Tintin opens with a brilliantly composed opening credits sequence that wonderfully pays its homage to its source material but after that, it feels like an inconsistent mash-up of Hergé's Tintin & Spielberg's Indiana Jones that isn't as rewarding as expected.Spielberg's direction is still worthy of mention for he shows a great comfort in what is a new filmmaking experience for him & is never hesitant to try a few experiments with the camera, for animation makes possible a number of sequences that would be too difficult to capture in a live-action scenario. The editing however is a mixed bag for it fails to provide a tighter plot & a brisker pace would've sufficed a lot.The animation is gorgeous for the rendering captures the authentic ambiance of the comics, every frame is richly detailed, characters aren't entirely computer-generated as is the case in most animated features but make use of motion-capture to bring the real performances of the actors behind the voices, and the ever dependable John Williams once again chips in with an adventurous, mesmerising & light-hearted score.The cast consists of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg & others and all of them chip in with fairly good performances. The characters look exactly like their comic book drawings, the voice acting as well as the motion-capture performance by all is commendable, Tintin's beloved dog Snowy is a great comic relief & whether it's humour or entertainment, the film has a few cheering moments for everyone.On an overall scale, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is underwhelming as far as what was expected from it but it still makes up for a good ride, if not a great one. The entire picture feels like the writers were unsure which aspect to favour more: character depth or big-screen spectacle, & they end up half-way on both. Nevertheless, the film promises plenty of fun, entertainment & wonders to its viewers. It's just that it won't be remembered in the years to come.",Null,3,4,15 May 2015
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Most Of It Is True!
","There was no way in hell I was gonna miss Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after finding out that it features the same director & duo of actors who were later responsible for the Oscar- winning The Sting, which I dearly loved. And to find it in my collection & realize that it has been sitting there for years turned out to be a pretty pleasant surprise.Loosely based on a true story, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an American western that tells the story of two Wild West outlaws who are chased by a special posse that is able to pick their trail no matter where they go, thus ultimately forcing the two to escape the law by fleeing to Bolivia where they ultimately find a more successful criminal career.Directed by George Roy Hill, the biggest strength of this film is the flawless chemistry between Paul Newman & Robert Redford who in their respective roles of Butch & Sundance carry the story throughout its runtime, and are wonderfully supported by Katharine Ross who plays Etta Place; Sundance's lover, while its camera-work, editing & music part is exquisitely executed.On an overall scale, there's plenty of fun, humour & charm to be found in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It's a beautiful film to look at, is highly enjoyable & entertaining from start to finish, its premise is handled in a very light-hearted manner and it also manages to culminate on a high with an ending that's as satisfying as it is heartbreaking.

Moana," 'Moana' Brings Disney Closer To Its Former Glory Than It's Ever Been
","Adventurous, endearing & delightfully amusing, the latest feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios finds the legendary studio at the very peak of its Revival Era and closer than it's ever been to its former glory, for Moana is another excellent blend of first-rate storytelling & dazzling animation that promises plenty of fun & enjoyment to viewers of all ages and skilfully delivers it.The story of Moana follows its titular character, the only daughter of a Polynesian tribe's Chieftain who's always been curious about what lies beyond the reef surrounding her island. And when their crops begin to fail, she sets off on an epic journey across the ocean to find the demigod Maui, who caused the blight by stealing a mystical relic from a goddess, and persuade him to return it.Directed by Ron Clements & John Musker, the film quickly glances over its mythology & Polynesian tribe's way of life before moving ahead with its main plot, and maintains a steady pace & fun vibe throughout its runtime. The direction is neat, plot is expertly handled, humour is finely applied even though it goes overboard at times, and the characters of Moana & Maui are handled with elegance.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, decorating the film with sumptuous set pieces and employs some hand-crafted magic as well on its CGI canvas. Every image brims with vibrant colours, sharp outlines, terrific lighting & a sense of depth. The soundtrack is beautifully composed & seamlessly integrated into the narrative, and while the musical numbers aren't catchy, they do carry a melodic tune.It's quite impossible to not like a film that has Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, playing a demigod, and singing songs. Bringing Maui to life with finesse, it's evident that Johnson had a lot of fun voicing this character that seems tailor-made for him in more ways than one. The character of Moana is voiced by a newcomer and she does an outstanding job at it, wonderfully balancing the vocal tonality to fit the particular moment.On an overall scale, Moana is a musical that has something in store for everyone. Not everything works out in the film's favour though, for the sentient coconut pirate scene was quite unnecessary and the sidekicks overstay their welcome but it offers consistent delivery of laughs, a welcome depth in its plot & characters, and wonderfully carved moments of genuine warmth to finish as another high-quality addition to Disney's repertoire. Definitely recommended.",Null,4,11,4 February 2017
Ocean's Twelve," Lacks The Freshness Of The Original And Doesn't Add Anything Of Substance
","Lacking the freshness of the original and going a bit overboard with its twists n turns, the follow-up chapter to Ocean's Eleven does exhibit the lavish look & carefree vibe of its predecessor and adds a couple more charismatic actors to its ensemble but its story is weak and only gets messier as it progresses.Taking place some time after the events of the previous film, Ocean's Twelve brings back all the members of the original team as they battle against time to pay back all the money they stole from the owner of Las Vegas casinos, with interest. To meet the demand, they decide to pull off another heist, however, there's a new player in town.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film picks up from where it left off in the last picture and doesn't take long to bring all of them back into the same room. The basic storyline is interesting but how the events unfold in the final print is where the problem arises, not to mention that the subplots relating to new characters don't add anything of significance.The sumptuous look n feel is retained and the European scenery is beautifully photographed. The smart manoeuvring of camera & refined use of colour palette adds a vibrant quality to its images. Editing is a mixed bag, however, as the numerous twists don't carry the same weight and appears forced into the narrative. And the background score doesn't have anything new to add either.Coming to the performances, pretty much the entire cast of Ocean's Eleven make their appearance in this one with Clooney & Pitt leading the pack like before while the new additions include Vincent Cassel & Catherine Zeta-Jones who play their part responsibly but their respective characters are very poorly sketched. Roberts however gets additional screen time and is able to improve on her earlier input.On an overall scale, Ocean's Twelve is an inferior sequel by all means that does take the arcs of its characters a little forward but doesn't add anything of substance. What's also disappointing is the climax that's far more ridiculous this time and seems way far-fetched than it did the last time. Still, there's some fun, laughs & amusement in store but if you're expecting a sequel that improves upon the original, then Ocean's Twelve isn't one of those.",Null,1,1,8 September 2017
Snatch," Guy Ritchie's Best Work To Date.
","Guy Ritchie's follow-up to his breakthrough feature may have the very same blood flowing through its veins that was present in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but it nonetheless succeeds as yet another prime example of its genre(s) that offers significant upgrades in all filmmaking departments, further enhances the director's style & visual flair, and still remains his finest work to date.Set in London, the story of Snatch follows multiple segments concerning various characters who weave in & out of mainly two entwined plots. The first plot deals with the search for an 86-carat diamond that was stolen during a heist while the second one is about two boxing promoters who get pulled into the world of match fixing by a notorious crime lord. Things soon go from bad to worse, resulting in some unexpected outcomes for everyone involved.Written & directed by Guy Ritchie, Snatch falls very much within the same universe as his debut film but it also shows the then-new filmmaker having a better grip at his trademarks and even his direction carries a more confident appeal. The screenplay brims with plenty of piercing dialogues, hilarious one-liners, crazy accents & memorable characters throughout its runtime and also exhibits precise control over its handling of the story's non-linear structure.The technical aspects share many similarities with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but benefit from a more polished execution. Cinematography features the same dynamic camera-work to capture all the action & unfolding drama. Editing is arguably its finest aspect for the final print is devoid of any dull moment, its 104 minutes of runtime unfolds at a terrific pace, and all characters gets their deserving screen time. Finally, the songs incorporated into the story is intelligently done for every track fits its accompanying sequence.Coming to the performances, Snatch features a versatile cast in Benicio del Toro, Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Alan Ford & others, and they all chip in amazingly well in their given roles. Although each one of these idiosyncratic characters have a vital role to play in the story's final outcome, my favourite of them all was the gypsy boxer Mickey, excellently played by Brad Pitt, for his nearly gibberish accent is hilarious as hell, screen presence is incredibly magnetic and thanks to Pitt's strong performance, he ends up stealing every scene he's in.On an overall scale, Snatch is a seamlessly intertwined amalgamation of stylish direction, smart writing, exquisite wit, perfect comic timing, zestful camera-work, immaculate editing, brilliant performances & bizarre soundtrack that takes its plot in all possible directions yet brings its story full circle in the end without leaving out any loose ends. An undeniable masterpiece, a timeless example of refined storytelling, and one of the greatest & funniest films ever made, Snatch is an unabashedly hysterical, extremely entertaining & immensely satisfying work of razor-sharp creativity that comes strongly recommended.",Null,0,1,15 October 2013

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The Best Political Satire Of All Time I Felt No Love For.
","Despite being one of the finest examples of genre-filmmaking that's neatly crafted, superbly scripted & wonderfully performed, Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is a film that I admire more than I love. I've no hesitation in calling it the ultimate black comedy or the perfect satire but I also won't deny that my experience with it was pretty ordinary, regardless of the few laughs in between.Set during the Cold War era, the story of Dr. Stangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying & Love the Bomb concerns a paranoid Air Force general who green lights a nuclear attack on Soviet Union without the knowledge of his superiors, thus causing mass panic in the Pentagon War Room where the President, his advisers, key officers & others desperately try to recall the bombers before they reach their destination.Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film is another masterwork of precision craftsmanship from the legendary director for I've nothing but admiration for its incredibly detailed & well-lit sets, the ironic elements in the script & its depiction of the complete absurdity of war. Camera-work is marvellously carried out especially during the base attack scene, Editing nicely balances its different subplots & its background score is another plus.Coming to the performances, the film features an impressive cast in Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden & Slim Pickens. Sellers here plays not one, not two but three different characters & is excellent in each one of his roles. Scott only gets better as the film progresses, Hayden is pretty grounded despite his unhinged character while Pickens doesn't leave much to complain about & plays his role straight.On an overall scale, Dr. Strangelove might very well be the best political satire of all time for it criticizes the nuclear conflict between US & USSR in the most biting manner possible, but the farther we're moving from the Cold War era, the weaker its impact seems to be getting. It's full of crazy characters, is filled with memorable quotes & crafted with panache but despite its strong legacy, I felt no love for it. Maybe one day I will, but today is not that day.",Null,1,4,25 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Not A Perfect Finale But Not A Disaster Either!
","The third & final instalment of the original Star Wars trilogy, Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi may not be as impressive as its revolutionary predecessors which at least had an interesting storyline at its core to fall back on once its visual encapsulation deteriorated in quality, as is the case at present, but it manages to cross the finish line before running out of fuel and is a satisfactory conclusion to the saga set in a galaxy far far away.Set one year after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi finds Luke Skywalker & his friends teaming up to free Han Solo from Jabba's captivity following which they learn of another Death Star being under construction by the Galactic Empire, this time under the supervision of the Emperor himself. With an opportunity to end the battle once & for all, the Rebel Alliance launches an all-out attack against the Empire while Luke & Vader confront for the final time.Directed by Richard Marquand, Return of the Jedi picks up the story from where the previous instalment signed off but takes its time to get moving. The whole sequence at Jabba's palace is overstretched & is at times cringeworthy. Being the final chapter, the film still finds time to meander on moments that should've ended up on the editing room floor. However, there is some solace in the fact that the arc of every character is brought to a satisfying conclusion, even if it takes a longer route to get there.The set pieces put forth by the production design team are more extravagant but the upgrades from one chapter to another isn't that big a leap, or at least it doesn't appear so. Cinematography continues to leave a positive impression with its inventiveness and the camera movements are a bit more energetic this time. Editing could've trimmed a few more moments to give its story a more compact structure & swifter pacing while John Williams once again delivers a fitting score that slightly enhances every moment.Coming to the performances, the cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams & others return for one last adventure and exhibit greater comfort with the roles they'd been playing for a while. The input by Hamill, Ford & Fisher is in tune with what's expected from them while the character of Darth Vader continues to amaze, and the finale is a fitting resolution to his arc. The first half lacks the sort of excitement that was prevalent in the previous instalment but the film does make few amends in the next half to finish on a fine note.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi neither has the freshness of A New Hope nor has the shocking appeal of The Empire Strikes Back and is definitely the weakest instalment of the three. A more coherent & tightly packed narrative in addition to a better pace would've resulted in a more enjoyable experience but despite all its shortcomings, it isn't entirely the disaster it was turning out to be in the first half. A scattered final piece that has its share of positives & negatives, Return of the Jedi may not be the perfect finale but it still bows out with its head in tact.",Null,1,2,20 January 2016
Fast & Furious 6," Builds Upon The Winning Blockbuster Formula Of Fast Five.
","The sixth instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast & Furious 6 follows into the footsteps of its predecessor and continues the series' new-found mantra of departing from its original street racing theme to move further into the heist thriller sub-genre. And even if it's not as refreshing & impressive as Fast Five, it nonetheless succeeds as another thrilling, ridiculously entertaining & undeniably fun extravaganza.The story of Fast & Furious 6 concerns Dominic Toretto & his crew, all of whom have retired to a comfortable life following the heist they pulled off in the previous chapter yet they still remain wanted fugitives in their homeland. But when Hobbs asks for their services to take down a skilled mercenary organisation in exchange for clearing their criminal records, Dom accepts the deal and reassembles his team to finish one last job.Directed by Justin Lin, Fast & Furious 6 is his final stint with this franchise and he decides to go out on a high note by delivering a picture that's far too enjoyable to worry about the laws of physics being bent here on few occasions. The screenplay packs in an interesting plot filled with excellent use of humour but it isn't as tightly gripped as the last instalment and is a slight step down in comparison. But a few elements do get an upgrade.The technical aspects follow the same formula that was applied in Fast Five and there isn't much to complain here for the set pieces look spectacularly detailed, the action sequences benefit a lot from its energetic camera-work, brilliant editing & more use of practical effects just like the last chapter although at times the action goes way too over-the-top yet not so exaggerated for most viewers to suspend disbelief. And the background score is fitting for the most part.Coming to the performances, the entire main cast that was present in the last one reprises its role, Michelle Rodrigues also returns to join the gang and Luke Evans is the new addition who plays this chapter's antagonist. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker do their usual best as Toretto & O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson continues to impress as Hobbs, However, Evans doesn't get enough screen time to show his mettle and his characters turns out to be a generic villain. The rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions.On an overall scale, Fast & Furious 6 builds upon the very ingredients that worked in favour of Fast Five and, barring a couple of issues, manages to stay on the track for the most part. Although not as amazing as the previous entry, this is nevertheless an immensely enjoyable blockbuster material that promises a lot of fun & thrills, and effectively delivers it. Definitely more style than substance although the margin isn't as vast as it had been in the first four chapters of this franchise, Fast & Furious 6 comes delightfully recommended.",Null,2,2,4 September 2015
The Expendables," Not As Good As It Could've Been But Still A Fun Ride
","Serving as a homage to the blockbuster action films of the 1980s & 90s while also paying tribute to the action stars of past & present era, The Expendables is an adrenaline shot of old-school action extravaganza as well as a casting powerhouse featuring some of the biggest & baddest names in the Hollywood industry that solely relies on nostalgia to make its mark & pretty much succeeds.The story of The Expendables concerns a group of elite mercenaries who are hired by a CIA operative & assigned a new mission to overthrow a Latin American dictator from his regime. While scouting the location, they discover the true nature of their mission with the help of a local & find out that the dictator is merely a puppet controlled by a ruthless ex-CIA officer.Directed by Sylvester Stallone, the film suffers in its storytelling aspects for no time is utilized in developing its plot or characters & it's right down on business early on in the picture. The performances aren't any special either yet the charm of seeing so many notable actors working together casts its own spell & makes you enjoy the ride without giving much damn about the story.The action is over-the-top yet finely choreographed, the scene featuring Stallone, Schwarzenegger & Willis together is a money-shot in itself, the entire cast clearly seems to be having great fun together but one thing I did wish it had was a formidable villain. On an overall scale, The Expendables is a film for those who grew up watching First Blood, Predator or Die Hard, and despite its lack of story, remains an enjoyable experience.",Null,0,0,6 November 2014

Black Mass," A Welcome Return To Form For Johnny Depp In A Biopic Marred By Uneventful Storytelling
","Bolstered by a truly magnificent performance from an actor who has a penchant for playing larger- than-life characters, Black Mass is another entry into last year's long list of biopics and although it paints a gripping portrait of a notorious crime boss, it's also marred by its generic plot & uneventful storytelling.Based on a true story, Black Mass chronicles the criminal life of infamous Irish-American mobster Whitey 'Jimmy' Bulger and focuses on the years when he became an informant for FBI for his own self-interests and assisted them in eliminating the rival gang while carrying out his crime business under federal protection at the same time.Directed by Scott Cooper, there isn't really anything worth mentioning about his latest movie other than Depp's show-stealing work which is probably the only thing that keeps this film afloat for the majority of its runtime. It's a shame considering that Depp gives one of his best performances in a very long time and yet everything else in the movie stays on base level.Production design team does well in recreating the timeline its story is set in, camera-work is finely carried out, Editing isn't that special for the plot unfolds by putting one factual event after another without any sort of build-up or elevation. The background score by Junkie XL also fails to add any excitement to the story and from a technical standpoint, this is mediocre work.Coming to the performances, Black Mass packs a terrific ensemble in Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon & others but it's only Depp who leaves a lasting impression. It actually feels good to watch him play an interesting character once again and like his best works in the past, he overshadows everything & everyone. The supporting work, however, is disappointing.On an overall scale, Black Mass isn't by any means a great crime drama or a fascinating biopic but it works as a welcome return to form for Johnny Depp whose career had almost faded into oblivion. While it certainly wasn't as underwhelming as I was led to believe, it's still an empty picture whose only saving grace is the vicious, intimidating & charismatic performance from an actor who was in severe need of a role like this.",Null,0,1,30 January 2016

The Town," Another Strong Vehicle For Ben Affleck To Showcase His Filmmaking Aptitude. Tense, Exciting & Thrilling.
","Riding on the momentum provided by its consistent dose of intensely gripping action, The Town is a tense, thrilling & entertaining crime thriller that, despite leaving none of the genre clichés on the sidelines, succeeds in keeping a firm grip on the viewers' attention and is more engaging than one expects.Set in Charlestown, a breeding ground for armed robbers, the story of The Town follows a gang of four lifelong friends who, after a series of successful bank robberies and close encounters with the police, set out to finish one final heist. But monitoring them closely is an FBI agent who's all set to bring them down.Co-written, directed by & starring Ben Affleck, The Town serves as another vehicle for the actor to showcase his filmmaking talents and there's plenty in the picture that attest to his eye for creating kinetically charged sequences that brim with excitement & tension. Affleck's direction is quite lean during moments of action but not so in the dramatic portions.While Michael Mann's Heat is an obvious inspiration, the overcast ambiance & setting is lifted from other notable crime thrillers. The story is riveting when it's dealing with the group's interactions or next assignments but loses interest whenever it attempts to focus on their separate lives. There's a lot that it could've done without, for those scenes only end up hampering its overall effectiveness.Coming to the performances, The Town packs a talented ensemble in Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall, John Hamm, Blake Lively & Pete Postlethwaite, with Renner leaving the most lasting impression of them all with a strong, stellar input. Affleck plays his part responsibly, Hall does well with what she's given, Hamm is just as good while Postlethwaite greatly impresses in his brief part.On an overall scale, The Town is thoroughly captivating, is expertly directed & benefits a lot from Jeremy Renner's show-stealing performance but it could've been much more if its drama was half as compelling as its masterly choreographed action segments. Nevertheless, Affleck's sophomore directorial effort further sharpens his filmmaking skills, has got more positives than negatives, and is going to satisfy most viewers, if not all. Definitely worth a watch.",Null,1,2,23 June 2017

Taxi Driver," Overhyped!
","Painting an interesting portrait of the underbelly of New York City with its lurid camerawork & deteriorating set pieces, Taxi Driver is a steady examination of an unsteady character whose arc unfolds like a ticking time bomb and leaves behind nothing but carnage & corpses when it finally detonates.Set in New York City during the 1970s, the story of Taxi Driver follows a Vietnam War veteran who's on the verge of mental breakdown and takes the job of night-time cab driving to cope with his loneliness, depression & insomnia but a couple of setbacks trigger his descent into madness as he eventually snaps and gives in to his violent urges.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film is crafted like a drug-induced reverie and is carried by a character who himself is struggling to hang on to his sanity. The plot is rather simplistic, most people in the picture are messed up in the head, and the themes of loneliness, depression & mental illness are wonderfully addressed. But what exactly makes it worthy of such praise?Is it the fever-dream atmosphere achieved by vibrant camerawork & neon lighting or is it Travis Bickle & what he stands for in the post-Vietnam War America or the downhill journey he undergoes or that iconic monologue that has become a pop culture mainstay ever since or that bloody violent finale? Maybe a combination of all mixed with cynical attitude of the 1970s? I'm not sure.There isn't anything necessarily wrong with the story or how it is translated to the screen. The atmosphere is dark & alluring, Cinematography captures the ugly side of New York like never before and the use of colour palette & lighting is inspiring. Bernard Herrmann's score has a dreamlike quality to it that not only fits the film's tone but also uplifts it. And the themes it addresses aren't difficult to grasp either.Coming to the performances, Taxi Driver puts Robert De Niro front & centre of the screen and the actor brings his disturbed character to cinematic life with panache. Supporting characters get only limited space to share with De Niro's Travis Bickle but Jodie Foster still manages to make her mark. Cybill Shepherd & Harvey Keitel play their roles well but it's De Niro who carries pretty much the entire film all by himself.On an overall scale, Taxi Driver is counted amongst the greatest films ever made and while I found it to be a fascinating insight into the deteriorating psyche of a troubled individual in addition to a splendid piece of filmmaking, I don't entirely concur with the masses when it comes to its legendary reputation. The film does what it set out to do but it is no game-changer. I rather found it overhyped to be honest. And if I'm the only one, then so be it.",Null,2,5,30 September 2018
Shutter Island," Martin Scorsese At His Most Unrestrained & Unapologetic
","Shutter Island happens to be the first Martin Scorsese film that I actually loved. Considered by many to be a departure from his usual forte, this neo-noir psychological thriller isn't rated highly by his most devoted followers but I'd argue that it is right up there with his finest directorial efforts.An ingeniously structured, intelligently layered & impressively acted genre delight that's dark, delirious & discombobulating, Shutter Island finds Scorsese indulging in unapologetic genre thrills, and also presents Leonardo DiCaprio in outstanding form as he adds yet another spectacular performance to his résumé.Pervaded with an air of mystery & sense of foreboding, the film effectively builds on its interesting premise, and only gets more gripping, thrilling & suspenseful as plot progresses. Scorsese keeps the plot faithful to its source material while eerie camerawork, tight editing & menacing music keeps the tense aura alive n kicking.Leading from the front is DiCaprio whose riveting input & magnetic presence only amps our interest & investment in his character's journey. And he's well supported by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow & Michelle Williams who all chip in with sturdy performances of their own. In short, the entire ensemble delivers and leave nothing to complain about.Overall, Shutter Island is a smartly directed, cleverly scripted & strongly acted mystery thriller that effortlessly sustains its chilling ambience from start to finish and is highly reminiscent of Hitchcock's thrillers. One of the best films of its year that keeps the viewers guessing at all times and makes fab use of genre elements to keep things taut & exciting, the 4th collaboration between Scorsese & DiCaprio is another quality work.",Null,1,2,17 January 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Vast Improvement Over The First Avenger
","A direct sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, the ninth instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe & the third in their phase 2 plan, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a vast improvement over its period-piece predecessor that finally brings its super-soldier into the 21st world environment & while there are few things worth complain about, most of its footing is spot-on.Set two years after the events of The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier continues the story of Steve Rogers; a super-soldier who's still trying to adjust in the modern world. The plot concerns the conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. which Rogers tries to uncover with the help of Black Widow only for Rogers to discover that his past hasn't been eliminated yet.Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, the film is thoroughly balanced when it comes to action & drama although the humour does take a hit in the film's intent to go a bit darker but not by much. The screenplay is brilliant too for the story keeps the core of its predecessor alive in its new form. Camera-work is dynamic, pacing is fabulous & Henry Jackman packs in with a score that feels much evolved.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Sebastian Stan & others with Robert Redford & Anthony Mackie as new additions. Evans is a natural in the role of Rogers & the suit is as fitting as before but it's his chemistry with Johansson that feels most refreshing this time. Rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions however I wish writers had put some more meat on the main antagonist here.On an overall scale, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of Marvel's better offerings which never loses the thread that connects it to the original, keeps the action flowing at regular intervals, is sprinkled with political themes that are nicely dealt with, features a quite formidable villain, has a surprising depth in both story & character elements, delivers the entertainment that's bigger & better than last time and while its large-scale spectacle remain ridiculously fun, it's how the whole film is narrated that makes it satisfying on many levels.",Null,0,1,30 March 2015

Ocean's Thirteen," Slightly Better Than Its Predecessor But Still No Match To The Original
","Slightly better than Ocean's Twelve but still not close to Ocean's Eleven, the third & final entry in The Ocean's Trilogy finds the original gang returning to Las Vegas for one last heist as things get a bit personal in this concluding chapter. Retaining the cool style & lighthearted vibe of its predecessors, the film does many things right but is still forgettable in the end.The story of Ocean's Thirteen is set in motion when one of the original eleven is double crossed by his former business partner who now owns his new hotel-casino. When the gang finds out about it, they decide to avenge him by concocting a plan to spoil the new hotel's opening night but to pull it off, they turn to a foe who shares their contempt for the common enemy and offers his assistance.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, Ocean's Thirteen marks a little improvement over its predecessor and, by taking a persona route, brings something new to the table. The light, playful tone remains in tact but the premise is more involving than it was the last time. Also, unlike the previous entry, the new addition to the ensemble plays a key role in the plot and has an interesting arc of his own.While the story has an interesting outline, the writers still end up making the plot complex and not easy to follow. Not every twist n turn makes sense, some moments are as ludicrous as the second film's museum robbing sequence, and it expects the viewer to just go along with everything that's unfolding without questioning the logic of it all. Sometimes, it does work. Other times, it doesn't.Coming to the performances, the original eleven return to reprise their respective roles once again. Vincent Cassel also makes an appearance while the most notable amongst the new additions is Al Pacino who plays the antagonist and utilises his infectious persona to great effect. Clooney & Pitt once again lead from the front but Damon gets a promotion as well while the rest play their part as expected.On an overall scale, Ocean's Thirteen is a satisfactory conclusion to the saga of Danny Ocean & his associates, if not a memorable one, and offers a good, lighthearted dose of fun & amusement just like its predecessors. It corrects a few mistakes that were made in the second instalment but also ends up creating some new ones which stop it from reaching the heights & delights of the original. Nevertheless, it's worth a shot.",Null,6,7,8 September 2017
Lost in Translation," Sweet & Sad. Sardonic & Funny. Original & Familiar. All At the Same Time.
","Original yet familiar, simple yet complicated, sweet yet saddening & funny yet tragic, Lost in Translation is a delicately crafted comedy-drama by Sofia Coppola & tells the story of an aged actor way past his prime & a young married woman just starting with her life, who meet & strike a wonderful chord together & covers their adventure in what is an alien environment to both of them. The film also deals with the themes of loneliness, culture shock, language barrier, insomnia & crisis with one's own life while presenting a blossoming romance between two people who are different in almost every aspect of their lives.Wonderfully written & nicely directed by Sofia Coppola, Lost in Translation is a satirical clash of different cultures & beautifully explores the feeling of finding oneself in an environment that's completely oblivious to a newbie. Cinematography captures some facets of Japanese way of life in a sound manner, editing keeps the interest in the story alive until the very end & the music that accompanies the scenes are perfectly fitting. Although the real star of the film is obviously Coppola's script & direction, the runner-up is definitely its two key performances from Bill Murray & Scarlett Johansson.Murray stars as Bob Harris; an actor going through a midlife crisis & is in Japan to act in a commercial. Finding the country too weird for him in every way & mulling over his past life plus recent loneliness, he happens to meet Johansson's character Charlotte, a young college graduate in Japan with his husband, who is a celebrity photographer. Charlotte is unsure about her life & is as lost as Bob, so when they chat for the first time, an instant connection is there between the two as both try to help each other in an atmosphere they don't want to be in and an innocent, budding friendship or maybe more develops between them as the film progresses. Both Murray & Johansson have delivered fabulous performances here that carries no major complaints & their chemistry together clicked amazingly well.On an overall scale, Lost in Translation turned out to be a very impressive, entertaining & heartwarming experience, thanks to Coppola's wonderful job behind the camera, lush cinematography, steady pace & superb performances from both Bill Murray & Scarlett Johansson. And although it presents only a single facet of Japanese life for most of its story, & did go slightly overboard in mocking their culture, Lost in Translation still manages to work as a wonderfully crafted motion picture for the most part & is one of the best original works in the careers of both its cast as well as crew.",Null,0,0,4 February 2014
Tangled," A Fresh Breath Of Life From The Studio That Had Been Sitting Dormant For Years.
","Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature still carries the label of the most expensive animated film ever made but it is also noteworthy for reversing the odds in the legendary studio's favour for Tangled marks the commencement of Disney's Revival Era and begins the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory.Tangled tells the story of Rapunzel, a young princess whose magical hair have healing properties, for which she was kidnapped by an old witch who then raises her as her own child. Having spent her entire life in an isolated tower, Rapunzel is curious to explore the world outside, and ultimately leaves her home to embark on a magnificent journey of self-discovery.Co-directed by Nathan Greno & Byron Howard, Tangled features all the hallmarks of a Disney fairy tale yet what eventually separates it from other similar examples is its clever combination of old & new. Despite having a simple structure & treading on familiar routes, there's ample freshness in its story, the characters are beautifully carved and the animation evokes a deep sense of warmth too.Blending the best of both traditional & computer animation, the 3D images retain the painting-like quality of hand-drawn style with pixel-perfect depth & sharpness of CGI and it is absolutely drop- dead gorgeous to look at, especially that lantern sequence which can easily rival anything that the studio has put up before or since, and its old-fashioned vibe only adds more richness to the story.Also returning to the fold is Alan Menken who contributes with a mesmerising score & fitting songs and even though they aren't very catchy, they work in the film's favour. Further benefiting the story is its fluid camera-work, tight editing & brisk pace plus the voice cast does a splendid job with their respective characters, the relation dynamics are sensibly explored, and the palace horse Maximus easily stands out.On an overall scale, Tangled is a fresh breath of life from the studio that had been sitting dormant for years and the way Disney manages to turn things around is by going back to its fairy tale roots, albeit with a reinvigorated passion, creative energy & upgraded visual flair. Delightfully refreshing, surprisingly heartfelt & scoring big on quality entertainment, Tangled is one of the finest entries in Disney's repertoire. Definitely recommended.",Null,2,2,10 April 2016

Barry Lyndon," A Once In A Lifetime Experience! A Dazzling Beauty Of Epic Proportion!
","Of all the classics that Stanley Kubrick had crafted throughout his filmmaking career, Barry Lyndon was the one I was least interested to check out. Period dramas aren't my thing for I find this genre of cinema far too preoccupied with its lush set pieces, period-specific make- up & antique costumes than the main story at hand and while this cinema does checkmark all those elements, there is something about it that sets it apart.From the moment its Warner Bros. logo appears on the screen, being accompanied by the famous classical composition, Sarabande, by Handel, Barry Lyndon had my curiosity. What eventually left me absolutely flabbergasted was just how extraordinarily beautiful its images were, from the first frame to the last. It's the most authentic looking period piece in cinema history and the way Kubrick has brought it to life is an unprecedented achievement in itself.A fictional account set in 18th century England, the story of Barry Lyndon is narrated in two parts and covers the adventures of its titular character. The first part follows an Irish named Redmond Barry and covers the journey & the means by which he acquired the title of Barry Lyndon. The second part covers the fall that followed after his rags to riches arc in the first half as we see Barry becoming increasingly obsessive with nobility which ultimately results in his tragic downfall.Written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Barry Lyndon features all the trademarks of the legendary auteur and presents him setting a new bar for photography in filmmaking. Shot mainly on location, the film effectively captures the timeline its story is set in, thanks to the in-depth research of 18th century period, its magnificently detailed set pieces as well as its immaculate costume design. Also, Kubrick's insistence to use natural light to capture majority of its sequences is one aspect that never fails to impress.Cinematography is undoubtedly the most impressive & influential aspect of Barry Lyndon. A jaw-dropping achievement that has innovation written all over it, the camera is static for the most part and makes efficient use of close-ups, steady zoom-in or zoom-outs. Relying only on natural light to film its drama, the camera employs specific lenses that allow it to capture sharp images in even low-light conditions, as evident in its night sequences which uses just a few candles as the only light source for the whole set. And it looks truly unique.The radiant glow of the night segments is highly reminiscent of its period and also matches the colour composition of various paintings depicting the night settings of that era. Images of daylight are no slouch either as in every scene, the background looks like a huge canvas of a gorgeous painting, and the sheer beauty of it is so breathtaking that one can pause any given moment and that frame is pretty much destined to look beautiful on any wall. Kubrick also makes another aspect work flawlessly for the classical compositions compliment the narrative amazingly well.Editing isn't much of an issue for the story remains compelling to an extent throughout its demanding runtime. The pacing is slow and takes us through many snippets of Barry's life, but some of it could've been left out. Those 187 minutes are frightening from afar but if you fall under the spell of its beauty, then it becomes a far smoother ride. The cast comprises of Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee & Hardy Krüger with O'Neal impressing the most. His character arc is wonderfully written, undergoes a full circle and O'Neal does his given role a complete justice while being finely supported by the rest.On an overall scale, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is the closest cinema has ever come to emulate the elegance & aesthetic quality of a popular painting on the film canvas. Yet, this isn't a film that everyone is going to love even if they end up admiring the heck out of it. Its overlong story, inaccessible characters & relaxed pace is what might veer some viewers off the course. Nevertheless, Barry Lyndon is a cinema that needs to be looked at & marvelled upon the same way people observe the brushstrokes on a beautiful portrait. An aesthetic, artistic & influential classic in every way that's in a league of its own, Barry Lyndon is period filmmaking at its most dazzling. Don't miss it.",Null,2,5,28 September 2015
Interstellar," A Stellar Work of Science-Fiction Filmmaking That's Ambitious, Audacious & Exhilarating.
","With designated masterpieces like Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight & Inception under his name, Christopher Nolan has risen exponentially through the ranks of American film industry as one of modern cinema's finest auteurs working today and, in a career that spans just over 15 years, has already cemented an impressive legacy with an incredibly devoted fan following that continues to grow every passing moment.Truth be told, I was very skeptical about Interstellar before deciding to check it out on the big screen. The trailers weren't as intriguing as I hoped plus the early reviews were even more divisive than The Dark Knight Rises (Nolan's worst film) which further dented my expectations. So I went in without expecting much, hoping to be disappointed but in the end, Interstellar turned out to be one of this year's most exhilarating cinematic experiences for me plus I really admire what Nolan tries to do here.Set in a near future, Interstellar presents a world that's unable to sustain humanity. With humans having reverted to an agrarian society due to shortage of food, their last hope for survival arrives in the form of a recently discovered wormhole which allows the possibility of intergalactic space travels. Piloting the spacecraft to embark on an interstellar voyage in search for a potentially habitable planet is Cooper whose relationship with his daughter is the very core element the film continues to revisit & explore throughout its runtime.Directed by Christopher Nolan who today is one of those rare filmmakers who gets to make his films his way, with complete artistic control over his projects yet with a rare advantage of big- budget support from major Hollywood studios. And Interstellar is an extremely ambitious & audacious effort which exhibits the best & worst of his talents as a filmmaker for the sense of warmth he's able to invoke through those awe-inspiring moments of beauty & wonder kind of gets nullified by the clunky & expository dialogues which unfortunately inhabit the whole picture.The screenplay is inspired from the works of Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist, & was penned down by Jonathan Nolan until Chris took over the directional duties & merged his own ideas into the existing script. Now when it comes to outlining a plot structure, Nolan is a master strategist yet the one aspect of storytelling he continues to struggle with is in the use of subtext which is nearly absent in his films as he relies too much on dialogues to feed each n every moment to his viewers. This method does make his stories more accessible to mainstream audience but also diminishes its overall impact.Coming to the technical aspects, Interstellar is a marvel from start to finish. The bleak future of the human race that's on the verge of extinction is depicted in a very grounded manner while events unfolding in space manage to stay within the established realms of theoretical physics for the most part. Production design work is marvellous for the set pieces are meticulously detailed, VFX make minimum use of CGI yet enhances the visual presentation by a great deal, Editing keeps the interest alive despite its 169 mins of runtime & even sound design is excellently carried out.Cinematography marks Nolan's first collaboration with someone other than Wally Pfister but his absence is hardly felt as Hoyte van Hoytema effortlessly steps into his shoes & elegantly captures the film in all its magnificence yet in a film full of such breathtaking visuals, it's heartbreaking that the camera never lingers on those moments of dazzling beauty which further exhibits Nolan's shortcomings as a visual storyteller. However, the mesmerizing score marks a welcome change from Hans Zimmer for it feels much more intimate, personal & emotional this time and is perfectly in tune with the film's events.Coming to the performances, Interstellar features a very star-studded cast in Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Casey Affleck & Michael Caine while also including cameos from Matt Damon, Ellen Burstyn & Topher Grace. McConaughey makes terrific use of his infectious screen presence here but his performance is a mixed bag. Hathaway is quite bland in her role, Chastain & Mackenzie Foy are the only ones who manage to leave a lasting impression while the artificially intelligent robot TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin) exhibits more character depth than its human counterparts.On an overall scale, Christopher Nolan's ode to human spaceflight is a stellar work of science- fiction filmmaking that's worthy of praise, admiration & appreciation for its ambition alone yet what stops this space opera from reaching the levels of greatness is the lack of depth evident in its characters in comparison to the profundity present in its science. Not everyone is going to appreciate what Nolan aspires to do here but after the mishap that was his last movie, Interstellar comes as a respite that this gifted filmmaker is still capable of leaving us in a state of pure bliss. Highly recommended.",Null,4,10,18 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," A Harrowing Journey Of Man From A Human To A Killing Machine!
","Having earlier shown the futility & irony of warfare in Paths of Glory, Stanley Kubrick returns to the genre of war once again to observe the tactics used by military to transform its newly recruited marine corps into killing war machines and captures the dehumanizing effects the Vietnam War had on soldiers through the eyes of Pvt. Joker, who is also the narrator of the film. What does it take to transform a normal human being into a remorseless assassin? Full Metal Jacket is Kubrick's attempt to answer that question.Full Metal Jacket is a two segments story. The first one concerns a new batch of US Marine Corps recruits who arrive at Parris Island for training under the command of Sgt. Hartman, their strict, disciplined & foul-mouthed senior drill inspector. Hartman employs a rigorous training regimen to turn his recruits into marines ready for combat and is severely harsh on a dim-witted & overweight recruit whom he nicknames Pvt. Pyle. The second part follows Joker, one of the recruits, and covers his harrowing experience in Vietnam.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Full Metal Jacket is definitely amongst the finest depictions of dehumanization on film canvas and works perfectly on many levels. Kubrick's direction is absolutely flawless in the first half but it stumbles slightly in the next half only to rise again during its nail-biting climax to finish on a high note. Cinematography has always been influential in Kubrick's films & this one is no exception. And with all things considered, it easily qualifies as one of the most technically sound examples of its genre.Coming to the performances, Full Metal Jacket features many unforgettable characters and Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio & R. Lee Ermey do terrific job in their given roles which elevates the film to a much better status than it would've been otherwise. Modine plays Pvt. Joker, who joined the US Marine Corps to see combat and the film is, on a superficial level, his story only. D'Onofrio devotes himself completely to his character of Pvt. Pyle and does a remarkable job in illustrating the transition of his character from a naive & clumsy recruit to a pure psychopath.But the real highlight amongst the entire cast is Lee Ermey as drill inspector Sgt. Hartman and thanks to his powerful, intense & show-stealing rendition, his performance easily ranks amongst the most dominating, memorable & extraordinary portrayals in cinema history. He is extremely punishing, mean, sarcastic & clever but when one considers his job of turning random men into heartless killers so that they can survive the horrors of war, the character of Hartman becomes fully justified. And out of all the amazing characters in Kubrick's films, Sgt. Hartman is undoubtedly my favourite.The entire film, on a closer look, is a study of duality. The two segments this film is divided into are completely different in their plot & treatment. The characters, during their arrival in Vietnam, are neither entirely compassionate humans nor cold-hearted assassins and seem to be battling moral dilemmas. Pvt. Joker wears a peace symbol on his jacket while 'Born to Kill' is written on his helmet. And there are many more references of duality such as that. Pointlessness of war, military brainwashing & dehumanization are other themes it deals with and all of these are addressed in an expert manner.On an overall scale, there are very few war films out there which so meticulously depict the gruesome effects war has on human psyche and Full Metal Jacket is unquestionably one of them. The first half of this film clearly outshines the second half in almost every filmmaking department because of which it may disappoint some viewers. But it has all the trademarks of a Kubrick masterpiece and remains one of his most entertaining works. In Joker's words, it tells how important a human life is & how lucky it is to be alive and, on the whole, it's one of Stanley Kubrick's most tightly crafted films that is aesthetic, artistic & influential in every possible manner.",Null,0,1,7 November 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Performances Are Its Strongest Suit. And Also Its Saving Grace.
","Drenched in pitch black humour & treading on thin ice throughout its runtime, Martin McDonagh's third feature film manages to be disturbing & amusing at the same time but not all its attempts at humour hit the right spot and the ones that do, their effect don't last for long.The story of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri follows a grieving mother who, infuriated by the lack of progress in the still unsolved case of her daughter's murder, challenges the local authorities by making a bold move that not only irks the ire of the police but also the town's residents.Written & directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges & Seven Psychopaths), Three Billboards begins on a promising note but the more we learn about its characters, the less interested we are to stay on board. McDonagh's dark humour may be too much to handle for some but it suffers from tonal inconsistency.Characters are as colourful as they are despicable, the interaction between them is sharp, at times unforgiving & seething with anger but the change they undergo over the course of the film's runtime is so hurried that it's not convincing enough. Its dark wit may be too dark for some but when it clicks, it's absolutely rib-tickling.The film's real strength, however, is the strong performances by its talented cast. Leading from the front is Frances McDormand in a showcase that's brimming with charged aggression. Woody Harrelson & Sam Rockwell chip in with terrific inputs of their own, and it's a battleground of wits whenever either of them share space with McDormand.On an overall scale, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is neither as wild & refreshing as In Bruges nor packs as interesting a set of characters as they were in Seven Psychopaths. Performances are its strongest suit & possibly its saving grace too, for the writing, dialogues & humour fail to leave their mark in what's possibly Martin McDonagh's weakest film to date.",Null,0,1,16 March 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," A Memorable Film Of Its Era, 'The Grapes Of Wrath' Is A Deserving John Ford Classic.
","Painting a gritty yet authentic portrait of family life ravaged by economic hardships, The Grapes of Wrath covers the strenuous ordeal faced by one family as it struggles to keep itself together when everything around them is falling apart. Steered by John Ford's assured direction & powered by a couple of stellar performances, it remains one of the most memorable works of its era.Set during the Great Depression, the story of The Grapes of Wrath follows Tom Joad who's out of prison on parole, only to find out that his family has been forced off their own land. Managing to reunite with them eventually, Tom & the Joad family set off to California in search of better work, opportunities & a hopeful future but face one misfortune after another, each testing their strength.Directed by John Ford, the film doesn't even try to sugarcoat any of its events and brings back the gruesome memory of living through the Great Depression for its viewers. There's constant friction between hope & hopelessness in the script but it is deftly written & wonderfully balances the arcs of its characters. Ford's direction also makes sure that the narrative is always on point & not tread around the edges.The production design team & location setting work in tandem to recreate the era that devastated thousands of lives while further assistance comes from its smart camera-work & patient editing to help the movie achieve its desired look n feel. But what holds it together is the outstanding inputs from Henry Fonda & Jane Darwell, especially the latter who delivers a powerful performance that only gets better as story progresses.On an overall scale, The Grapes of Wrath is tragic, heartbreaking & harrowing but, despite its bleak appearance, it isn't entirely devoid of hope & optimism. We witness the Joad family disintegrating under the burdens of crashed economy yet the end result is a reflection of the strength that lies in unity and how a strongly-bonded family can steer through any situation. Expertly directed, deftly written, brilliantly performed & culminating with one of cinema's most inspiring monologues, The Grapes of Wrath comes thoroughly recommended.",Null,3,4,31 July 2016

Empire of the Sun," Dull, Monotonous & Overlong, Empire Of The Sun Is Unsure Of What It Wants To Be.
","For a film that brims with such a strong passion for flying, it's quite ironic that Empire of the Sun doesn't even manage to take off at any given point over the course of its runtime. Quite a chore to sit through, this coming-of-age war drama from Steven Spielberg is completely devoid of his usual flair, remains monotonous in tone from start to finish & is pretty much unsure of what it even wants to be.Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, the story of Empire of the Sun is set during the Second World War in China and tells the story of Jamie; an English kid who after getting separated from his parents during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai ends up in an internment camp where he learns to survive despite the poor conditions & establishes a good living but when the war nears its end, so does his innocence.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film opens on a fine note by wonderfully introducing all its characters and while there are various indications that the story might pick up anytime now, that moment never really arrives. The whole story feels like a compilation of many episodes sewn together without any clear idea of what Spielberg intends the film to be, plus whatever emotion it was trying to evoke from its audience simply falls flat.Most of the technical aspects are sound in its execution but that part is a default option in a Spielberg feature. Production Design team does a brilliant job in putting up some authentic- looking models & set pieces, Cinematography nicely captures the surroundings & unfolding events but it also lacks the immersive dimension that invites the viewers into the story. And while John Williams delivers an expressive score, it only works in bits n pieces.Editing is disappointing for the story is way longer than it needs to be, isn't properly paced either & its 154 minutes of runtime is severely felt. Also, some sequences that made its way into the final cut should've ended up on the editing room's floor instead. The only thing that saves Empire of the Sun from being a complete disaster is the magnificent performance by Christian Bale in what is his on-screen debut & he's finely supported by John Malkovich.On an overall scale, Empire of the Sun is possibly about the loss of innocence but it travels in so many directions that it ends up halfway on everything it was trying to be. Its motive is unclear whether one approaches it as a coming-of-age story or a war drama. The only good thing about the film is that it brought on screen a promising talent who would later go on to become one of Hollywood's most sought actors but apart from that, Empire of the Sun has nothing interesting to offer.",Null,2,6,12 June 2015
American Sniper," Another American Propaganda Piece That's Nothing More Or Less
","Out of the 8 films nominated for Best Picture Oscar this year, 4 of them chronicle the lives of notable personalities, first being the renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, second is the legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, third being the great civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma, & finally we have the deadliest sniper in US military history, Chris Kyle, in American Sniper.Based on Chris Kyle's memoir of the same name, American Sniper tells the story of the decorated United States Navy SEAL marksman who served 4 tours in Iraq War & earned the notorious tag of the most lethal American sniper with 160 confirmed kills. The film adaptation briefly goes through segments of his life, his time in Iraq as well as the difficulties he faced in readjusting to civilian life & domestic responsibilities after returning home from his duty.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film is a one-sided perspective on the subject of Iraq War that depicts all Iraqis as dehumanized savages, is brimming with American glorification, even tries to justify United States' moral policing habit on the world stage when that nation could really use some of that in its own backyard, and just like Lone Survivor which was released over a year ago, is nothing more than a mere propaganda piece made exclusively for American audience.The technical aspects are finely executed but none of its elements have anything that can make them stand apart from other examples of the genre. The cast comprises of Bradley Cooper & Sienna Miller, and the rest of its supporting cast simply exists. Cooper chips in strongly in the role of Chris Kyle & adds another impressive act to his résumé while Miller is brilliant as Kyle's wife who becomes increasingly concerned with the evident change in her husband's personality.On an overall scale, American Sniper neither succeeds as one of the best examples of its genre nor is amongst Eastwood's best works as a director. However, you have to give it to the 84-year old filmmaker who still isn't showing any signs of slowing down & despite being a very mediocre film in my opinion, its combat sequences nevertheless manage to elevate its entertainment factor to a level that's probably enough to satisfy the majority of mainstream audience.Undoubtedly the weakest nomination in both Best Picture & Best Actor category at the upcoming Academy Awards, and quite unworthy of its recent praise as well considering that there were far too many better films & more compelling performances to come out in 2014, American Sniper might be raking in millions at the box-office right now but content wise, it has nothing new in store for those who are looking for a fresher outlook on the subject of war.",Null,10,33,21 February 2015
Rocky II," No Match To Its Groundbreaking Predecessor But It's Still Fun & Entertaining
","The second instalment in the Rocky series, Rocky II follows the aftermath of the events that transpired in the first picture and follows Rocky Balboa who, after his loss to Creed, retires from boxing and gets busy enjoying his new found fame but after failing in multiple facets of life, he returns to the boxing arena to face Creed, who's been consistently goading Balboa for a rematch.Written & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky II stays faithful to the spirit of the original but is highly erratic with its theme & characters. Rocky's inability to handle his sudden fame & money in an effective manner is the story's core element but it's not well executed. Much of the picture feels like plodding for we already know what awaits in the end and can't wait for that final battle, which fortunately is as impressive as it was in the previous chapter.The set pieces do benefit from a bigger budget, Stallone's direction isn't very good but it's still passable for the most part, Camera-work is best during the training & boxing segments, Its 119 minutes of runtime is excessive for the story it packs in, Bill Conti delivers another sensational soundtrack that's in tune with the last feature while the performances from its entire cast is a step down when compared to their input in Rocky, although it isn't a major departure.On an overall scale, Rocky II heads into the right direction and tackles the right themes but due to Stallone's inexperience as a director, it isn't able to address & execute them properly and is certainly no match to its groundbreaking predecessor. The final act is pretty much its saving grace for without it, this would've been a highly frustrating experience. Predictable but also true to its origins, Rocky II may not deliver the same high thrills but it manages to be fun & entertaining in bits n pieces, and is worth a shot.",Null,1,1,24 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Epic Filmmaking At Its Most Mundane!
","The fifth instalment in the Star Wars saga and the second chapter in Lucas' prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones has all the ingredients that made The Phantom Menace such a repugnant piece of sh*t and while it offers no improvement over its pathetic dialogues, wooden characters, lacklustre performances & lame attempts at humour, it does manage to be minutely less unbearable than its predecessor.Set 10 years after the events of The Phantom Menace in a galaxy far, far away, Attack of the Clones finds the galaxy on the brink of a civil war and follows Anakin Skywalker who's now put in charge of taking care of the Senator he happens to have a crush on, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt made on the Senator, the inquiry of which leads him to discover a secret clone army for the Republic.Co-written & directed by George Lucas, Attack of the Clones continues his fascination with digital effects while adding more dumb-looking & useless characters to populate his space opera. His direction ups the action aspect a little, which is a welcome change, but there is still no emphasis on plot or character development. There at least seems to be some sense of direction however when it comes to where this story is headed but it doesn't amount to much in the end.The set pieces & poorly-rendered creatures still don't contribute to the story in any way and their presence only made everything unintentionally funny, even if it isn't really meant to be. The screenplay is an absolute mess for the little improvement in storytelling is only negated by the dumbest dialogues you can hear in a motion picture. The action scenes are larger in scale but it all looks terribly dated now. Editing is poor again and its 142 minutes of runtime is unnecessarily stretched for no reason whatsoever.The visual effects, sound design & digital cinematography may have added new stuff in the world of filmmaking back then but all of that still can't make up for what the picture lacks in the basic storytelling section. The story is definitely overlong, the pacing is stagnant for the most part, the darker elements are introduced but not played with, the characters remain as dumb as before, there is more action than the previous episode but it's mostly dull & boring and even the climactic lightsaber duel fails to evoke any sort of excitement.Coming to the performances, the cast of Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz & others reprise their given roles while Hayden Christensen & Christopher Lee are new additions. The characters are still bland, thus giving these actors nothing to work with. Christensen plays Anakin Skywalker and his performance is probably the worst of them all. Lee is in as this episode's antagonist but even his input is mediocre. As far as its reprising cast is concerned, there's still no noticeable improvement from any.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones is as miserable an entry as The Phantom Menace was, but its narrative exhibits a bit more focus on where this prequel trilogy is supposed to be heading. Even though it didn't have to endure the crazy hype that its predecessor was subjected to, the movie fails to take advantage of the severely lowered expectations and delivers a film experience that's very much on the same level of dullness & absurdity. Another forgettable, inexcusable & spiritless entry in Star Wars prequel trilogy, Attack of the Clones is epic filmmaking at its most mundane.",Null,2,11,20 December 2015

The plot ain't that superior but it still manages to make its story work with sharp photography, wonderful music & songs by Danny Elfman and brilliant voice performances from Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter & other supporting cast.

Lion," Another Middling Story Of Its Kind That Doesn't Pack A Strong Emotional Punch.
","Capturing a young man's Google Earth-assisted journey to find who he is and where he came from, Lion is a kind-hearted slice of a real-life story that handles its content with sincerity & compassion for the first hour but turns into exactly what one feared during the second hour to finish as another middling story of its kind.Lion follows a young Indian kid who, in an unexpected turn of events, ends up thousands of miles away from home and finds himself lost on the streets of Calcutta. The plot covers his difficult time in the city and the many challenges he survives before being adopted by a couple in Australia and, after growing up, sets out to find his lost family.Directed by Garth Davis in his feature film debut, Lion allots its first hour to a newcomer, covering the little kid's struggle in the unknown city with honesty & patience, and paves a solid platform for the remaining hour. But then it all goes downhill as it turns into a sappy melodrama that unfolds at a sluggish pace before concluding on a lame note.Coming to the performances, Lion features a fine cast in Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, David Wenham & Rooney Mara but the real star is Sunny Pawar who plays the young kid and carries the entire first half on his shoulders. Patel always reminds me of that massively overrated Slumdog Millionaire but does well here and is wonderfully supported by Kidman & Mara.On an overall scale, Lion opens on a promising note but loses its momentum in the second half, for the way it connects the dots backwards is rather too uninspiring, and the emotional finale it then inches towards is overly exaggerated. While its heart is at the right place, the execution isn't as spot-on as it needed to be. In short, it has its share of impressive moments but as a whole, Lion doesn't pack a strong enough punch.",Null,0,1,19 February 2017
Forrest Gump," A Heartwarming Rendition Of Love, Loss, Redemption & Stupidity.
","Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture in the year that had heavyweights such as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption & Disney's The Lion King, Forrest Gump isn't as impressive as the above-mentioned classics but its optimistic take on the unpredictability of life, stability between its genre elements, and a charismatic performance from Tom Hanks turns it into a cinema that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.Based on the novel of the same name, Forrest Gump tells the story of its titular character, a simple-minded, kind-hearted & good-natured guy from Alabama whose life turns out to be a wicked blend of luck & destiny as he steers through as well as influences some of the historic moments of the second half of 20th century America. However, despite accomplishing great things in life, what he covets most is the love of the woman he grew up with, who never reciprocates his feelings.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Forrest Gump is a series of brief episodes stitched into one wonderfully layered tapestry and is expertly narrated from start to finish. There are a few hiccups in between but it is a smooth adventurous ride for the most part. Eric Roth's screenplay takes liberty with the source material but what's admirable about it is its relentless focus on the central character. It does allow its supporting characters to breathe but none of them have an arc that's compelling enough.Production design team does a stellar job in recreating the time-specific surroundings. Visual effects is extensively applied throughout the story plus its tinkering with the archival footages of some of United States' most significant events of the later half of the 20th century was a VFX feat of its time. There aren't any glaring issues with its camera-work. Editing fails to give it a tightly- knitted structure, while the background score & incorporated songs are in sync with the unfolding events & depicted timeline.Coming to the performances, Forrest Gump features a dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson & Sally Field, and although everyone does well in their given roles, the film is powered by Hanks' outstanding performance. Fresh off his Oscar-winning role in Philadelphia, Hanks chips in with another smashing work and is the soul of this tale. And he's well supported by Sinise & Field who play Forrest's platoon leader & mother respectively while Wright ably portrays the self-destructive life of his love interest, Jenny.On an overall scale, Forrest Gump often gets a lot of flak for stripping both Pulp Fiction & The Shawshank Redemption off their deserving accolades but it does have a heart & identity of its own. I wasn't very impressed by it during my first viewing but it has managed to grow on me over the years and now I do admire its positive outlook on life & the numerous mysteries it has in store. A delightful comedy, an emotionally resonant drama & nicely covering the themes of love, loss, redemption & stupidity, Forrest Gump is one of the best films of its year.

"Monsters, Inc."," Pixar's Funniest Film To Date.
","A powerhouse of imagination, creativity, heart, humour & passion, Pixar Animation Studios' funniest film to date is such a fascinating blend of excellent direction, smart screenplay, heartfelt narration, perfectly-timed humour, colourful characters, gorgeous photography, dazzling animation, terrific voice-work & mesmerizing score that it not only ranks amongst the studio's best films but is one of the greatest works of its medium as well.The story of Monsters Inc. is set in the parallel city of Monstropolis which is inhabited by monsters who travel into the human world to scare the children for their scream is what powers the whole city but they are also equally terrified of being contaminated by them for children are considered toxic. When a human child accidentally enters into their world, the titular company's top scarer & his best friend try to return her back to where she came from.Directed by Pete Docter, Monsters Inc. is narrated with such fine elegance that within few minutes into the picture, we get a clear idea of why this world exists & how it works without it being spoonfed to us. Add to that, it's full of gags & hilarious moments that keeps it a rib- tickling experience from start to finish. And then, there is Pixar's very own trademark fusion of heartfelt storytelling with stunning animation that radiates an immense sense of warmth & admiration for what it's about.As the film is an outlook on life from a monster's perspective, the story provides a massive canvas for the animators to create, design & render these characters in various shapes & sizes, and it is pretty evident on the screen what a remarkable job they've done. But where these talented minds at Pixar truly triumph is in assigning personalities to each one of them. Every monster here gets its own personality, their world is fully realized & despite the visual difference, it's effortlessly relatable.Taking a leaflet out of almost every kid's nightmare & coming up with the idea of monsters' absolute necessity to scare children, it's amazing how Pixar keeps coming up with original concepts that feel incredibly familiar yet has an originality of its own. And the process of refining that concept into a heartwarming story that viewers of all ages can relate to & then pushing the boundaries of animation with relentless innovation is exactly what makes them the best animation studio on the planet.The voice-cast is another gem for it comprises of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Mary Gibbs, Steve Buscemi & others, and they all are perfect choices for their characters. The chemistry between Goodman & Crystal is no doubt impeccable but the real charm is provided by the character of Boo; a 2-year old human girl in the monsters' world. The story is light-hearted for the most part, filled with hilarious situations n set-ups but when it goes for the dramatic effect, it nails it so well that many are sure to leave misty eyed by it.The 3D animation in itself was groundbreaking at its time of release but even after all these years, it looks damn impressive. Whether it's the realistic rendering of animated fur or the skillful use of lighting or that jaw-dropping 'door vault' sequence, Monsters Inc raises the bar that was set by previous Pixar features and is visually enticing all the way through. Also worthy of mention are its ingenious use of camera angles, tight editing that provides a breezy flow to its narrative & Randy Newman's emotionally resonant score.On an overall scale, Monsters Inc. is one of Pixar's most enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying works that takes its creativity in the storytelling department & innovation in its 3D animation to an all new realm. A masterpiece in every sense of the word, Pixar's fourth feature film & their first to be not directed by John Lasseter has been adored & cherished by viewers of all ages ever since it made its debut on the silver screen, and for the timeless classic this film is, it's gonna continue to do so for decades to come.

Southpaw," Predictable, Formulaic & Overly Melodramatic, Southpaw Fails To Deliver The Knockout Punch.
","Predictable, formulaic & overly melodramatic at times, Southpaw is a cliché-ridden sports drama that may not have anything new to add to its genre but thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal's brawny performance, it manages to redeem itself to an extent and while the drama remains stale for the most part, it is able to derive some entertainment from its boxing matches.The story of Southpaw follows an undefeated professional boxer whose life is turned upside down when his wife is shot & killed in a brawl that erupts between him & an up-and-coming boxer. The devastating incident leads him on the path of self-destruction but when he loses the custody of his daughter because of that, he decides to get his life back on track again.Directed by Antoine Fuqua, Southpaw is that same tale of redemption we have seen before so many times and the drama itself is pretty weak to hold everything together. Kurt Sutter's screenplay is filled with terrible dialogues that get annoying real quick and it's only after the turning set of events that the movie is able to find some sort of soberness in both its plot & characters.The boxing bouts are able to grab the viewers' attention, camera-work is all over the place & not every attempted technique works out, especially that point-of-view shot in the matches. Editing could've trimmed down a lot more for its 121 minutes of runtime is excessive for the story it tries to tell. And last but not the least, James Horner's score doesn't really uplift the whole experience by any means.Coming to the acting department, Southpaw features a fine cast in Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams, Forest Whitaker, Naomie Harris, Oona Lawrence & 50 Cent, with only Gyllenhaal & Whitaker truly committed to their roles. Gyllenhaal gives his all when he is in the ring and carries the film on his own for the most part. Whitaker supports him nicely with an assured performance while the rest are more or less forgettable.On an overall scale, Southpaw tries to present itself as a gripping tale of redemption but it doesn't do anything different to separate its tale from the already existing crowd. Even the final fight this movie was building up throughout its runtime isn't as rewarding as expected but it nonetheless allows the story to conclude on a respectable note, if not a memorable one.

","The twelfth instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the final chapter of their Phase Two plan, Ant-Man is a small-scale, light-hearted & sufficiently entertaining blockbuster that brings a new superhero into the already crammed Marvel family and although it may not be as heavy handed as some of their biggest extravaganzas, there's hardly anything refreshing about it.Ant-Man tells the story of Scott Lang; an engineer turned criminal who wants to support his daughter but is unable to secure any job due to his criminal record. Things are set in motion when he decides to commit a burglary with his crew and steals a super-suit that allows him to shrink in scale & amplify in strength, following which he assists the suit's owner in pulling off a heist that will save the world.Directed by Peyton Reed, Ant-Man was initially supposed to be Edgar Wright's pet project, who worked on it for years before being removed by the studio after creative differences arose between the two. What Reed has done after taking the director's helm from Wright is that he has completely modified the script in order for the film to fit into Marvel's existing universe, which is in contrast to Wright's vision who intended it as a standalone feature.While one can argue over just how much was chopped out & what all was retained from the original screenplay, it would've been quite interesting to see Wright's take on the minuscule superhero. Nevertheless, Reed's take isn't a total disaster for the movie actually feels like a typical Marvel flick with its simple plot, charming lead, playful wit, fun vibe & family-friendly entertainment. And although it will satisfy majority of mainstream viewers, it could've been much more improved.The set pieces come in all shape & sizes this time and with added enhancements from the visual effects department, they look detailed enough. Cinematography makes heavy use of macro photography & many interesting point-of-view shots while kinetic camera-work drives its action. Thanks to its predictable plot & some lame attempts at humour which don't work out, its 117 minutes of runtime is felt at times. Visual effects is top-notch as expected while Christophe Beck's score feels pretty generic.Coming to the performances, Ant-Man features a good cast in Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Michael Peña & others, and most of them do a fine job in their given roles. Rudd, however, is a revelation for he proves that he can be charming enough in the lead role of a big-budget blockbuster. His performance as Lang is well-balanced and he carries most of the film on his own. Douglas is in as Hank Pym but chips in with a mediocre input. Lilly does well with what she's given, Peńa is annoying & Stoll isn't really intimidating as the villain.On an overall scale, Ant-Man delivers the big-budget extravaganza it promised, even if it is on smaller scale when compared to its predecessors but from the storytelling perspective, it definitely ranks amongst Marvel Studios' weaker entries, that may have been avoided if it had added greater depth to its main plot & characters. Even though this film is designated by Marvel as their Phase Two finale, it works more or less as a prologue for Phase Three. A playful introduction to a new character & spearheaded by Paul Rudd's on-screen charisma, Ant-Man is no quality blockbuster but it's still worth one viewing, at least.",Null,13,26,22 November 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Delivers What It Promised. And It Never Promised High-Quality Entertainment.
","The fifth instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe & the final one before The Avengers, Captain America: The First Avenger introduces the only avenger that was so far missing in Marvel's Phase 1 plan & unlike the previous standalone features, this one is a period piece whose story is set predominantly during the Second World War.Captain America: The First Avenger tells the story of Steve Rogers; a frail but patriotic man who wants to enlist in the US army but is constantly rejected due to his poor health until he is accepted into a human experiment program that transforms him into a super-soldier with enhanced capabilities after which he tries to stop the fanatic leader of a cult organisation from carrying out his plans of world-dominion.Directed by Joe Johnston, this one started on a good note & was going very well for a while until the main antagonist decided to reveal his real face, after which it just becomes increasingly difficult to not find it amusing, even in moments that are not meant to be so. The plot ties in nicely with other films of the same universe, makes fine use of humour from start to finish, and remains a light-hearted, crowd-pleasing entertainer for the most part.Coming to the performances, Captain America: The First Avenger features a good cast in Chris Evans, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell & others with none of them really leaving a lasting impression but Evans does well to keep the story glued together and is nicely supported by the film's periodic feel, large-scale action, mesmerising score, old- school patriotism & some clever references to many adventure classics of the past.On an overall scale, Captain America: The First Avenger definitely isn't as bad as everyone led me to believe. The storyline never takes itself seriously which can be used both in favour n against it. The plot sometimes wanders in the middle & even lacks a sort of freshness for the story treads into zones it has been before in many other examples of its genre but despite a few shortcomings, Captain America: The First Avenger still delivers what it promised. Worth a shot.",Null,0,0,27 March 2015
American Hustle," Worth A Watch? Absolutely. Best Film of the Year? Nope.
","Some hustle for respect. Some hustle for love. Others hustle for truth. But we all hustle to survive. American Hustle was one of the most anticipated films of the year & even though it turned to be a very well made crime drama, I really doubt if it's a great one. It had all the ingredients & potential to become the best film of 2013 but in the end, it still felt short of complete on the satisfaction level for me & was definitely missing something, probably a more tightly structured plot.David O. Russell is one of those directors whose number one priority while making a film isn't the film's plot or its progression but the intricate study of its characters. The screenplay makes brilliant use of humour, the character arc is nicely developed and the film is greatly helped by its cinematography & more so by costumes & hairstyles to create that 1970s ambiance. And when it comes to casting, American Hustle boasts a cast that's far more star-studded than what any other film of its year had to offer.Christian Bale looks immensely convincing here as the con man Irvin Rosenfeld with that slouch posture, combover & huge tummy but in the end, it wasn't him who was the best thing in the film. Bradley Cooper is steadily turning out to be a rising star. And Jeremy Renner plays his part well. But this time, it's the ladies who stole the show. Amy Adams gives a strong & enthralling performance here but even she is overshadowed by the new tour-de-force in cinema today, Jennifer Lawrence. The part played by Lawrence here is so spectacular that it might bag her another Oscar this upcoming season & in case it does, it's a well deserved one.On an overall scale, American Hustle may not have lived up to my expectations from it, due to the script's inconsistencies & minor flaws, but thanks to David O. Russell's kinetic direction, its finely developed characters, superb use of sly humour & its star-studded cast's exuberant performances, it is nonetheless an incredibly entertaining motion picture that lives up to most of its hype, if not all, and is fine enough to satisfy majority of its viewers. Worth a watch? Absolutely. Best film of the year? Nope.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,5,7,15 January 2014
Incendies," Powerful. Intense. Unflinching. Devastating. Haunting.
","Powerfully haunting, brutally unflinching & emotionally devastating, Incendies is that slow poison whose real potency is realised only when it's too late & the irrevocable damage to your psyche is already done. Absolutely unforgettable once you've seen it, Incendies isn't just the best feature that director Denis Villeneuve has made so far but is also the finest to come out from Canada.Opening with Radiohead's single, 'You and Whose Army?', the story of Incendies is told in two different timelines which later converges into one to deliver a huge jolt of shock. One storyline follows twins Jeanne & Simon who journey to the Middle-East in order to fulfil their mother's final wish which is stated in her will, while the other timeline follows their mother's life & is told in flashbacks.Directed by Denis Villeneuve, whose other works include Polytechnique, Prisoners & Enemy, Incendies presents the filmmaker in prime form & even though the film is slightly overlong, it somehow manages to keep us invested into its story long enough until its final revelation, which is strong & shocking enough to shake the very foundations of human relationships.Set pieces provide a very raw & authentic atmosphere to the whole feature, cinematography brings a gritty layer of its own & captures the events in fine detail, editing could've provided a better pace by trimming down a few lingering moments, performances are very convincing, and the score is brilliantly composed plus Radiohead's single seamlessly fits its narrative.On an overall scale, Incendies is a beautifully crafted, nicely written & strongly performed cinema about love, hate & wars which delivers such a disturbing, distressing & traumatic cinematic experience that it will leave an indelible scar of its own on the viewers' psyche & is a haunting masterpiece in every sense of the word. Definitely amongst world cinema's finest films of the decade, Incendies comes strongly recommended.",Null,0,2,12 October 2013
The Godfather: Part II," The Greatest Sequel Of All Time, And Certainly The Most Honoured.
","Making a sequel that can manage to live up to the expectations of the original is an achievement in itself. But when the original film is being universally hailed as the greatest motion picture ever made, measuring up to that same feat is undeniably a near impossible task. But then, that's exactly what The Godfather Part II manages to accomplish by building upon the original in ways most sequels never dare to and is possibly the only film in existence that has the calibre to challenge the reputation of The Godfather. Boasting all the ingredients that made its predecessor one of world cinema's greatest triumphs, The Godfather Part II remains one of the most critically & artistically successful films in cinema history and amongst all sequels, is certainly the most honoured.The Godfather Part II tells the story of two generations of the Corleone family, thus serving as both a sequel & a prequel to the original, transitioning within the same film. The prequel portion is illustrated in a series of flashbacks and depicts the life of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in the previous film & by Robert De Niro in this one) and shows his rise from a poor immigrant in 1910s New York to the highly powerful & respected boss of the Corleone crime family. The sequel portion deals with the aftermath of the events of the first film and continues the journey of Michael Corleone as the new Don and shows him tightening his grip on his family business and expanding it into Vegas & Cuba. The two parallel dramas within the same film also serve as antonyms to each other, considering that one part follows Vito Corleone's rise to power through love, fear & respect while the other part represents the fall of Michael Corleone from the ruthless boss of a vast empire to a lonely & empty shell of a human being.Continuing the saga from where it signed off in the previous part, Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo, this time, bring the origin & evolution of the Corleone crime family on-screen through flashbacks but also carry forward its current legacy in the sequel segment of the story. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is much improved than it was in The Godfather and presents him in complete control of all filmmaking aspects. The screenplay is expertly written by Coppola & Mario Puzo, adapting the prequel part from the novel while envisioning the sequel part from scratch and, just like the previous film, contains some of the most memorable quotes in movie history. Cinematography inherits the same Technicolor print from the original and adds different contrasts to distinguish the two parallel timelines occurring within the film. Editing is equally impressive for it balances the two stories beautifully and keeps the pace in check throughout its 200 minutes of runtime. Art Direction & Set Decoration shows major enhancements over its predecessor. And finally, the music by Nino Rota is even better, building upon the iconic score of The Godfather and exploring newer territories in this one.One of this saga's biggest strength has been its remarkable cast & splendid performances. The Godfather Part II features Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton & Talia Shire in their reprising roles while also adding Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo & others to its strong ensemble. Al Pacino has given many spectacular performances in his film career but his work in this film remains his best. The cold & ruthless Michael Corleone, played exceptionally well by Al Pacino, returns to screen as more evolved & unforgiving and this performance of Pacino easily ranks among the finest that cinema has to offer. Robert De Niro comes next with an equally magical performance as young Vito Corleone and brilliantly modified his voice & expressions to match the attributes that Marlon Brando brought to this character in the previous film. John Cazale gets more screen time and delivers a heartbreaking performance as Fredo Corleone. Lee Strasberg & Michael V. Gazzo also chip in with strong inputs as Hyman Roth & Frank Pentangeli, respectively. And other impressive contributions come from Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams-Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, & Gastone Moschin as Don Fanucci.On an overall scale, everything about this sequel just works. It is more star-studded than the first film and all the filmmaking methods introduced in The Godfather appear seamlessly evolved in this second part. Fans will always be divided over which is a superior film but there is no denying that both movies are paramount examples of flawless filmmaking. As for the two stories that are masterfully intertwined within this film, I personally prefer the flashback segment more than Michael's tale for it was much better filmed, more captivating & also added quite an amount of artistic touch to the whole narrative, comparatively. From start to finish, this masterpiece improves upon the original in such impressive ways that not only it succeeds as a successful follow-up to its predecessor but also shares the same class of greatness with it and both films, since their inception, have been highly instrumental in influencing its genre as well as cinema aesthetics. Displaying greatness in all aspects of filmmaking, The Godfather Part II is an ingenious work of expert artistry in both front & behind the camera and serves wonderfully as an epic conclusion to the violent history of the Corleone crime family. Certainly the greatest & most respected sequel of all time and one of the greatest treasures of world cinema, The Godfather Part II comes one hundred percent recommended.",Null,1,3,5 January 2016
The Bourne Ultimatum," A Rare Second Sequel That Works. Best Film of The Bourne Trilogy.
","A staggering work of precision craftsmanship, an absolute marvel of action filmmaking & a fitting conclusion to the Jason Bourne saga, The Bourne Ultimatum is a rare second sequel that works flawlessly by taking a huge leap with its premise to effortlessly surpass the towering expectations set by its much-beloved predecessors & isn't just the finest installment of The Bourne Trilogy but is impressive enough to qualify as one of the greatest films ever made.Picking up the storyline right where it was left off in The Bourne Supremacy before taking a six weeks leap, The Bourne Ultimatum continues the quest of Jason Bourne as he retraces his steps back to his origin with a few help along the road to guide him through but also standing in his way is a ruthless CIA official who's willing to do anything it takes to eradicate Bourne in order to protect the secrecy of Operation BlackBriar - the upgraded version of Operation Treadstone.Directed by Paul Greengrass, this is arguably the finest work of his so-far terrific film career & presents him in complete control of every aspect of the story. The screenplay is a gem in itself for the plot is very tightly structured from start to finish & smartly ties up all the loose ends to conclude the trilogy on a really high note. And further enhancing the overall experience is the remarkable balance between its moments of action & drama, both executed to near-perfection.Cinematography employs Greengrass' signature use of hand-held cameras to its full potential which in turn makes the action sequences all the more amazing by adding a frenetic energy to it. Editing is carried out in a furious manner for the story is ferociously paced. And John Powell's score once again infuses flavours of its own to further intensify the entertainment with Moby's 'Extreme Ways' once again serving as an icing on what is an already delicious cake.Coming to the performances, Matt Damon finally gives us the most complete rendition of Jason Bourne which, when blended with Damon's infectious screen presence & strong performance, also turns this quintessential assassin into one of recent cinema's most iconic figures. Supporting cast also chips in with commendable performances amongst which David Strathairn & Joan Allen stand out in their given roles of Noah Vosen & Pamela Landy, respectively.On an overall scale, The Bourne Ultimatum is a powerful blend of kinetic direction, taut screenplay, dynamic photography, tight editing, breakneck pace, electric score, mind-blowing action & stellar performances that's stronger, faster & better than its predecessors in almost every department. Exciting, entertaining & immensely rewarding, The Bourne Ultimatum sets a new bar for action thrillers to follow and, along with Identity & Supremacy, makes up for one of cinema's finest motion picture trilogies.",Null,0,1,18 September 2013
Rush," One of the Best Films of 2013
","Rush is an ingenious recreation of the 1976 Formula One season and recounts the intense F1 racing rivalry between James Hunt & Niki Lauda. You don't really need to be a F1 racing fan or even be aware of what actually goes on in that sport to truly appreciate this film because what it depicts in its two hours of runtime isn't something that is exclusive to this very sport; It's about how our rivals sometimes bring out the best in us when we have got something to defend or overcome.The direction by Ron Howard is brilliant, the screenplay by Peter Morgan is pretty authentic, plus the vivid cinematography & concise editing only added more depth to the film's storyline but the real highlight of this film is its two fabulous performances coming from Chris Hemsworth & Daniel Brühl as Hunt & Lauda, respectively, amongst which Brühl ends up stealing the show in a very closely fought battle. And the music by Hans Zimmer infuses an energy of its own into this film to enrich the overall experience.On an overall scale, this film is one of the best sports dramas to come out in recent years and is an immensely well-made & highly satisfying ride of adrenaline rush that delivers the goods in just the right doses with its vibrant pace, intense action, arresting music & solid performances from its cast. There are minor flaws here & there but most of its footing has been correct and thanks to its pure edge-of-the-seat entertainment, Rush easily storms its way into the best ranked films of 2013.Full Review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,2,3,30 September 2013
Predator," Often Imitated But Never Duplicated, Predator Stands In A League Of Its Own.
","One of the most enjoyable, quotable, entertaining, exhilarating & testosterone-filled action extravaganzas of all time, Predator is a strong shot of adrenaline that fuses action, adventure, science-fiction, horror & thriller into one and is delivered with such remarkable finesse that even after two decades & countless imitations, its ass-kicking experience has never been duplicated.Set in the jungles of Central America, Predator concerns an elite special forces team of six who are ordered in to assist a CIA officer on a rescue mission which ultimately turns out to be a ploy. But the deception soon becomes the least of their concern when, on their way out of the jungle, they find themselves being stalked & hunted by something that's not of this world.Directed by John McTiernan, the film opens with a brief prologue after which it travels the road of an action-adventure feature for a while but over the course of its runtime slowly, steadily & seamlessly transitions into an impressive sci-fi horror that ends up succeeding on all fronts. The idea is incredibly original, the premise is highly intriguing, the setting is absolutely fitting & the casting is pitch perfect.The screenplay may not have that immense depth of characterization but the simple basics of it is able to provide each character their distinct personality without causing any distraction when they're working as a team. Cinematography expertly uses the atmosphere of jungle to its advantage and with its controlled panning shots manages to pull the viewers in as, just like its characters, we also try to look harder for something lurking somewhere in those trees.Explosively paced from start to finish, it never lets the viewers settle down for a moment & gets busy with its main plot as soon as all its characters are introduced. Add to that, editing wonderfully arranges the predator's point of view shots with those of its characters without ever stepping over the line. Visual effects still holds up pretty well, sound is cleverly used & Alan Silvestri's spectacular score effortlessly adds a sense of impending doom to the whole narrative.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Sonny Landham & Richard Chavez, led by none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger. The lean & muscular bodies of these actors ends up being an impressive entity in itself for it adds more meat to the badass characters they play while also improving their physical presence in the picture. And their overall interaction with each other is simply flawless.As for the creature itself, it's cleverly imagined by the writers, expertly designed by Stan Winston & wonderfully mimed by Kevin Peter Hall on the screen. On an overall scale, Predator is one of the finest examples of quality filmmaking in which each aspect works in perfect harmony with the other to deliver a cinematic experience that's damn satisfying in every manner & retains its high quality no matter how many times you watch it.A genuine classic, a genre masterpiece & one of my favourite films of all time, Predator is a must for every action, sci-fi or horror fan out there.

Nightcrawler," 'If You Want To Win The Lottery, You Have To Make The Money To Buy A Ticket'
","A thrilling masterwork of precision craftsmanship, an immensely fascinating vignette of the pursuit of American dream & a thought-provoking exposition of the dark side of TV news business, Nightcrawler is a firmly crafted, neatly structured, viciously executed & intensely entertaining thriller that presents its interesting premise in a very polished manner but what single-handedly elevates it to a whole new level is Jake Gyllenhaal's manic performance.Set in the nocturnal underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles, Nightcrawler tells the story of Louis Bloom; a driven young man desperate for work who muscles into the cut-throat profession of L.A. crime journalism by filming murders, mayhem & accidents taking place throughout the city during nighttime and with the help of a local TV news veteran eventually succeeds in blurring the thin line between observer & participant to become the star of his own story.Brilliantly written & fabulously directed by Dan Gilroy, Nightcrawler is a blazing work of originality that marks a sensational directional debut for Gilroy & is presented in a very polished manner. Cinematography crisply captures the silent, almost deserted look of Los Angeles during nighttime & seamlessly encapsulates the whole picture with a quiet sense of foreboding tension. Editing is carried out in a concise, calculated manner while James Newton Howard's score simply fits.Coming to the acting department, this is Jake Gyllenhaal's show all the way as his work here effortlessly overshadows every other input from the rest of its cast n crew. From the gaunt appearance to those unblinking eyes & creepy smirk, Gyllenhaal completely gets under the skin of Louis 'Lou' Bloom and plays the sociopath with riveting finesse to carve out a jaw-dropping performance that's easily his career-best work. Supporting him are Rene Russo, Bill Paxton & Riz Ahmed who all chip in with vital contributions.On an overall scale, Nightcrawler can be seen as a stinging satire of TV news business, a biting criticism of modern capitalist society & a contrary interpretation of American dream yet above all, it remains a deeply unsettling yet immensely fascinating character study of a fanatical sociopath. Ingeniously shifting its tones by blending subtle moments of humour into its dark ambiance and bolstered by Jake Gyllenhaal's coyote-like presence & bone-chilling performance, Nightcrawler is one of the best films of the year that comes highly recommended.",Null,0,2,24 November 2014
The Aviator," A Larger-Than-Life Story Of A Larger-Than-Life Icon
","The second collaboration between Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio finds the duo bringing on screen the larger-than-life story of a larger-than-life figure. A richly detailed, vividly photographed & brilliantly performed epic biographical drama, The Aviator is another fine addition to the esteemed filmmaker's extensive body of work.With its meticulously detailed set pieces, inventive cinematography & apt costumes, Scorsese takes us back in time to a glamorous era, and paints a fascinating portrait of Howard Hughes from his industry pioneering highs to crushing personal lows. But there are sloppy scenes in between, and its 170 minutes runtime is quite excessive.Leonardo DiCaprio plays the iconic real-life persona with gusto, articulating Hughes' mannerism, interactions & worsening mental health with gripping intensity. And he's well supported by the rest of the cast, especially Cate Blanchett who leaves her own mark as Katherine Hepburn, plus her chemistry with DiCaprio is delightful to watch.Overall, The Aviator does soar under Martin Scorsese's assured direction but there are times when he takes the foot off the pedal, thus resulting in loss of momentum. The commitment from the cast & crew is thorough, the colour grading is a highlight in itself, and the story as a whole makes for an interesting sit for the most part. But unlike his best works, The Aviator isn't memorable.",Null,0,0,14 January 2020

Bird Box," Never Quite Reaches Its Intriguing Potential
","Opening on an instantly gripping note with promise of more thrills waiting ahead, Bird Box paves a solid foundation during its first act yet fails to fully capitalise on it, thanks to the unnecessarily drawn out plot that allows the tension to dissipate, and the weak ending that wraps the entire journey on an underwhelming note.Directed by Susanne Bier (In a Better World), the set up is brilliant, for it creates the right kind of intrigue, and the decision to not show the supernatural entities works in its favour as well. However, the film's 124 mins runtime isn't earned, it has too many characters & it indulges in subplots that don't contribute much to the final outcome.The perilous journey down the treacherous river sequence had all the ingredients to be one potential nightmare for the viewers but Bier fails to keep things taut & tense as the plot detours to less interesting events. Sandra Bullock plays her part responsibly plus the two kids aren't drawbacks either. However, that insane twist was by all means an insane choice indeed.Overall, Bird Box begins on a promising note yet finishes in a way that leaves a lot to be desired. The scares are intermittent yet effective plus the creepy vibe is well-sustained for the most part which might keep the interest alive for many viewers but there was room for improvement here. A strong start marred by a downhill journey, Bird Box is another middling entry in both its genre & Netflix canon.",Null,0,1,3 January 2019
American Pie," The Quintessential Teen Sex Comedy!
","The quintessential teen sex comedy that surfaced on the silver screen at the turn of the new millennium and went on to spawn a franchise consisting of numerous sequels & a direct-to- DVD spin-off series while also influencing pop culture, American Pie is a delightful, hilarious & harmless comedy that does exactly what's expected from it... and then some more.American Pie tells the story of four high-school seniors who decide to make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate and attempt to achieve their goal of getting laid by prom night. The plot follows their adventures as almost all of them run into embarrassing but also hilarious situations at one time or another and find the pressure mounting as the prom night approaches.Directed by Chris & Paul Weitz, American Pie features a shallow plot line & weak characters and yet it manages to be a smooth ride for the most part that never takes itself seriously & simply swims with the tide. The humour is crude, the laughs are plenty, the film is aware of its limitations and tries to have fun with what it has, and the cast does well with their given roles plus their chemistry clicks.On an overall scale, American Pie remains an endlessly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining & surprisingly good piece of genre filmmaking that still brims with freshness, packs a massive dose of nostalgia, and exhibits a lot of charm over the course of its runtime. Not everything works out in its favour & a couple of moments may have lost its potency over the years but American Pie still works because its heart is at the right place.",Null,0,1,7 November 2015
Watchmen," A Groundbreaking Achievement Of Its Genre
","A gorgeous blend of art & entertainment that's accomplished on both technical & narrative scale, Watchmen is one of the greatest adaptations of a graphic novel on the silver screen for it not only manages to translate the feel, texture, tone & essence of its source material on the film canvas in its absolute form but is also the most thematically rich of all the films that have surfaced in the superhero genre of cinema, so far.Set around the mid-1980s in an alternate reality in which superheroes came into existence, America won the Vietnam War & the nuclear tension between United States n Soviet Union is at an all-time high, the story of Watchmen concerns a group of mostly retired American superheroes who, while investigating the recent murder of one of their colleagues, uncover a far more sinister plan which they try to stop before it is implemented.Directed by Zack Snyder, Watchmen is his most accomplished work to date for he's able to bring on screen what was considered un-filmable by many & unlike 300, he succeeds in doing so without going for the green-screen unless left with no choice. Using the existing comic book as storyboards, Snyder is able to retain the texture & tone of the novel which when blended with his very own trademarks, turns Watchmen into something that feels truly unique to its genre.Screenplay is deftly written, characters have a well-defined arc and the various themes & pop-culture references it deals with are expertly handled. Production design team provides an otherworldly setting to the film with its intricately designed sets, Cinematography makes near-perfect use of colour palettes & lighting plus the lavish use of slow-motion actually fits its narrative. Editing paces the plot steadily throughout its 186 minutes of runtime & the way its incorporated songs exhibit a contrasting effect to accompanying scenes is sheer genius.Coming to the acting department, Watchmen features a very unconventional cast in Patrick Wilson, Malin Åkerman, Jackie Earle Haley, Matthew Goode, Billy Crudup & Jeffrey Dean Morgan and all of them deliver damn good performances although it's Haley who ends up stealing the show as the masked vigilante Rorschach as every scene involving him is a treat to watch. Yet my favourite moment is the segment showing us the origin of Dr. Manhattan for the way it is arranged, scored, executed & presented is no short of perfection.On an overall scale, Watchmen is an immensely rich, unflinchingly bold & unquestionably unique take on superheroes and in more ways than one, is a groundbreaking achievement of its genre. With a lack of any star in its ensemble cast, a complex & allegorical plot that unravels more on multiple viewings and its extremely grim & depressing tone, it is destined to polarise its viewers & garner a devoted cult following but just like any great work that was quite ahead of its time, this masterpiece will one day have the respect it truly deserves.

The Bourne Identity," An Explosive Start To One Of Cinema's Finest Trilogies
","Several grades above your typical spy-thriller, running at a frenetic pace & riding on Matt Damon's strong performance, The Bourne Identity is a pulse-pounding dose of action extravaganza that seamlessly balances its highly captivating premise with full-throttled action to succeed as one of the most entertaining, exciting & satisfying films of not only its year but its genre as well.Based on Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name, The Bourne Identity tells the story of Jason Bourne; an extraordinarily skilled asset suffering from psychogenic amnesia who tries to find out his true identity. Continuously hunted by police & CIA everywhere he goes, he takes the help of a German woman to find out why he's being pursued while also trying to rebuild his memory from all the clues he could find.Directed by Doug Liman, the film really benefits from his kinetic work behind the camera & is an intensely gripping ride from start to finish. The screenplay is deftly adapted from the book with major emphasis on plots & characters that comes along with burst of superbly filmed action. Camera-work & Editing work together in harmony as the film is full of frequently edited hand-held shots yet everything is presented in a very concise manner.Coming to the performances, The Bourne Identity establishes Matt Damon as a stunning lead performer for the actor absolutely nails his character with a tour-de-force performance & it's really difficult to imagine someone else filling in for this role. The supporting characters are equally well-written & excellently performed but it's Damon's show all the way. Also, John Powell's vibrant score infuses an energy of its own that makes the picture all the more engrossing.On an overall scale, The Bourne Identity is a first rate spy-thriller with an immensely engrossing plot that benefits greatly from its brilliant direction, clever writing, dynamic photography, tight editing, expertly-filmed action, energetic score & show-stealing lead performance. A fresh breathe of life for its genre that's destined to leave most viewers highly entertained & hugely satisfied with its explosively paced premise, The Bourne Identity is a must for every action cinema lover out there.",Null,0,1,18 September 2013

Justice League," DC Films' Desperate Attempt To Emulate Marvel's Success Hits A Dead End
","An amalgamation of terrible direction, shoddy writing, thinly-sketched characters, flat performances, horrible VFX, lazy camerawork, inconsistent tone, dull pacing, lacklustre editing & stale soundtrack, Justice League is as bland, lifeless & soulless as big-budget blockbusters can get, and is so atrocious that it actually makes their first two mediocre-at-best efforts look good. DC Extended Universe was already on the verge of collapse before this crossover feature but instead of rescuing the franchise from an early grave, Justice League only ends up hammering the final nail on its coffin. One of the worst films of 2017.",Null,2,4,11 February 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An Unforgettable & Spellbinding Journey Into Middle-Earth
","Whenever an acclaimed book is chosen for a film adaptation, the biggest concern its fans generally have is whether the film would capture the events in the same spirits as its author did or not. However, when it came to adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings on silver screen, the expectation turned out to be so huge that the trilogy was almost doomed to fail for this legendary Middle-Earth saga was no mere literary work & over the years had garnered such an unprecedented following that it was deemed 'unfilmable' by many, including Tolkien himself.Nevertheless, the first trailers were enthusiastically received & the anticipation kept building until in December 2001, everyone from Tolkien fans to critics & cinephiles lined up just to see if the first chapter of the most ambitious project ever undertaken in cinema history will manage to live up to its surmounting hype. And not only did The Fellowship of the Ring succeed in surpassing all the sky-high expectations with effortless ease but brought alive Middle-Earth in such breathtaking detail that it set a whole new standard of epic filmmaking, which remains unsurpassed as of today.The Lord of the Rings was meant to be seen as a single work divided into three volumes & so is the case with its film adaptation. Opening with a brilliantly narrated prologue that invites even the newcomers into its world with smooth comfort & also sets the tone for the upcoming events, The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins; who inadvertently possesses the One Ring that once belonged to the Dark Lord, Sauron, & is tasked with the mission to destroy it before it falls into the hands of the evil. The subtitle refers to the fellowship of companions who join Frodo in his quest.Director Peter Jackson was a relatively unknown filmmaker until he helmed this project & what really helped the cause is that he really understands the Tolkien's world, being a Middle-Earth fan himself. The screenplay he co-wrote with Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens is structured to have a universal appeal so that it could please both fans of the book as well as first-time viewers. Jackson's direction is even more impressive as every single aspect achieves perfection under his distinct cinematic vision & the emphasis given to the smallest of details is very much admirable.Coming to the technical aspects, production design is a masterwork of stunning craftsmanship & the set pieces are absolutely gorgeous to look at. The beautiful landscapes of New Zealand stands in for Middle-Earth & is splendidly photographed while the camera also makes terrific use of lighting, composition, inventive angles & surroundings to provide a timeless sense of being in a completely different but highly fascinating world. Make-up & Costume design are also meticulously carried out while Sound breaks new ground & captures every moment with stunning clarity.The one restriction a film faces & a book doesn't is its length. Even 3 hours of runtime fell short in capturing the first volume of Tolkien's epic saga but whatever Jackson & his crew managed to fit in those 178 minutes still makes up for an epic tale. The extended edition adds 30 more minutes of footage which further develops its characters, adds more depth & enhances the overall experience drastically. Yet the most groundbreaking aspect remains its visual effects which elevates this film to an undisputed level of grandeur beauty while Howard Shore's spellbinding score further enhances the experience with its majestic & mesmerizing tracks.Almost every film requires at least three ingredients to come out as a great product; A smartly- written script, a talented director who understands the script & has the vision to realize it on the screen and finally, a skilled cast that can infuse new lives into these scripted characters. The Lord of the Rings gets the first two ingredients right & a mistake in the third could've been catastrophic to its fortunes, only that it wasn't because the assembled cast is simply pitch- perfect for they seamlessly fit their fictional characters & are extremely convincing in their given roles.On an overall scale, the on-screen adaptation of The Lord of the Rings commences on a perfect note without discarding any of the elements that made Tolkien's works immortal. It begins the journey with its cleverly written prologue, immerses viewers into its world with its intriguing plot, dazzles them with its beautiful photography & visuals, connects them with its wonderfully fleshed-out characters that further benefit from sincere performances, amazes them with thrilling action sequences, and provides a heightened sense of emotions through its heartwarming score.A film that is able to achieve even a few of what's stated above is almost certain to succeed but when it accomplishes every single one of these aspects, then it becomes something else entirely and that's what The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is: A magical blend of art & entertainment, a landmark moment in cinema history, a genre-defining masterpiece, a timeless classic & a jaw-dropping cinematic experience that's epic in every sense of the word. One of the greatest motion pictures ever made, The Fellowship of the Ring is cinema at its most breathtaking.",Null,0,1,5 October 2013
The Matrix Revolutions," Everything That Has A Beginning Has An End.
","What began as one of the most original, stylish & groundbreaking examples of sci-fi filmmaking eventually concludes on a heartbreaking low as The Matrix Revolutions fails in delivering a fitting finale & is arguably the weakest chapter of the trilogy which, instead of connecting the dots & tightening the loose ends, leaves the viewers wandering for answers by adding more questions to the pile.Starting exactly where The Matrix Reloaded signed off, The Matrix Revolutions continues the journey of Neo who ultimately learns that he needs to travel to the machine city in order to end the war. The rest of his associates & Zion, however, prepares for their last stand against the machines as a massive army of sentinels manages to breach into the only remaining human city to kill every last man, woman & child.Written & directed by the Wachowskis, the film offers more sequences set in the real world than in the simulated reality of the matrix but the siblings' struggle with the story which was so flawlessly executed in the first film is pretty much evident in this second sequel as they fail to provide a satisfying closure. Even the final fight the whole film builds itself up for turns out to be absolutely ridiculous.Technically, The Matrix Revolutions is admirable in a number of aspects. The set pieces are astonishing to look at, the atmosphere is more sinister than before, camera-work is pretty good, VFX is a mixed bag for the action sequences set in Zion are very engaging while the very same moments in the matrix look stupid. The background score is probably the only aspect that has been consistently impressive in all three films.On an overall scale, The Matrix Revolutions follows into the footsteps of The Matrix Reloaded & is a disappointment in every sense of the word. The action sequences are impressive to look at which will keep few viewers engaged but the philosophical ideas that got messed up in the second feature never sorts out & becomes all the more confusing. Destined to leave most viewers frustrated than satisfied, The Matrix Revolutions is a forgettable finale.",Null,0,0,27 November 2014
Man of Steel," Neither the Superman We Deserved Nor the One We Needed.
","In the ever expanding universe of comic-book superheroes, Superman is quite possibly the greatest of them all. However, filmmakers have tried & failed time after time in bringing his larger-than-life persona to the silver screen in a convincing manner. And ever since Batman Begins showed the world how to do a superhero film right, almost every single one of them has only gone back to the drawing boards for a new beginning & a movie about Superman was only in the queue.Having no relation whatsoever with any of the previous Superman films, Man of Steel tells the story of Clark Kent who while growing up learns about his extra-terrestrial heritage & journeys to discover his true identity as well as the purpose of his life. Keeping himself as anonymous as possible, he's ultimately forced to reveal his identity, confront his heritage & save mankind from complete annihilation when other survivors from his long-extinguished planet invade Earth while looking for him.I guess the best way to proceed would be to simply go ahead with what worked for the film & what didn't. Let's starts with the positives first. David S. Goyer's idea to re-envision the mythology of Superman has more rights than wrongs but it isn't executed properly. Second, is Henry Cavill. Fitting the suit perfectly, Cavill is terrific in the iconic role & also has a pretty domineering screen presence but the emotional dimension of his character is poorly written which unfortunately leaves a void in what could've been a brilliant rendition of Superman.Third, is its action n visual effects which was expected to be larger than life & Man of Steel delivers on that front. The carnage, destruction & mayhem present in its action sequences is a visual treat that's jaw-dropping to look at. And the final positive in my opinion, is Hans Zimmer's heavily electronic but truly magnificent score. Synchronising beautifully with the events of the film & elevating the action scenes to newer heights with its loud & grandeur tracks, the soundtrack of Man of Steel is possibly the only aspect with no complaints.As far as the negatives are concerned, I'll try to keep it short, if possible. To start with, the entire film has no element of surprise at all & is overloaded with clichés of its genre. Despite being directed by Zack Snyder & few inputs from Christopher Nolan, the style never really resembles to either of them. The non-chronological arrangement doesn't work out as the flashback sequences only act as interruptions to the main story at hand. The dialogues are corny, pale & 'eff-ing stupid'. But that's not all for I got a few more things to complain about.Cinematography adds a shade of grey to the story as if Superman was living in Gotham. Its slow pacing & predictable narration makes it quite boring with relief only coming from the action moments in the second half. The characters are poorly developed in the script which didn't help the performances either. Amy Adams is mediocre as Lois Lane, Russell Crowe is very annoying as Jor-El & Michael Shannon kept hamming as General Zod. Rest are even stupider than the above stated apart from Diane Lane who did good in her role of Martha Kent.I think the biggest issue with Man of Steel is that it tries way too hard to resurrect its fallen hero by applying the same method that worked so well in Batman Begins, thinking that it'll work for Superman as well. What Goyer, Nolan & Snyder fail to grasp is the fact that both Batman & Superman are two highly contrasting icons who are influenced by very dissimilar circumstances in their hugely different worlds. While the world of The Caped Crusader is dark, the world of Superman plus his suit is brightly lit & full of colours & not all dark tinted like it is in this picture.On an overall scale, in spite of all its flaws, inconsistencies & shortcomings, Man of Steel somehow manages to do enough to justify a sequel and although it tries to sell the origin story of Superman like Batman (something at which it fails miserably), the film nevertheless succeeds in seducing the majority of its mainstream audience with its eye-popping visual extravaganza and, just like the usual summer blockbusters, is more style & less substance. So, does the entire ordeal of restarting the story of Superman gets it right this time? The answer is a simple NO!",Null,3,8,18 November 2013
28 Weeks Later," An Inferior Sequel Yet Very Much Capable Of Standing On Its Own.
","The follow-up chapter to Danny Boyle's post-apocalyptic horror that infused a new life into the subgenre of zombie films by replacing its reanimated corpses with people infected with rage-inducing virus, 28 Weeks Later stays true to many elements of the original but makes way too many absurd choices over the course of its runtime to finish as an inferior sequel.Set nearly 6 months after the events that transpired in 28 Days Later, the story of 28 Weeks Later paints an empty portrait of London that seems to be on the road to recovery after US military intervenes to restore order. The survivors are brought into a quarantined facility but things once go out of control when a surviving member turns out to the carrier of the virus that decimated the entire city.Co-written & directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 28 Weeks Later begins with an absolutely thrilling prologue that sets the tone for the upcoming events. The plot then takes us through what all has happened in the time gap between the two films and from that point onwards, it's a downhill ride. There are plenty of poor decisions made here, whether its reintroducing the virus or a resurfacing zombie or the drama surrounding one dull family.The set design manages to capture the tone of the original but fails to take advantage of it. Cinematography goes completely mental after the brilliantly filmed prologue for the camera is swung without any sense of direction and the chaotic aura it was aiming for isn't entirely realised. Editing is fine for the most part. John Murphy returns with a welcome score. And the performances are all over the place, with Jeremy Renner leading from the front.On an overall scale, 28 Weeks Later follows into the footsteps of its predecessor with much bigger aspirations & higher budget but fails to provide us with characters that are worthy of emotional investment, something 28 Days Later pulled off quite effortlessly. However, much of its unfolding story retains the thrills & terror of the previous chapter, and apart from a few dumb decisions, it's an enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying ride capable of standing on its own.

The Thing," A Masterpiece Of Unrelenting Terror, Nail-Biting Suspense & Omnipresent Paranoia
","A masterpiece of unrelenting terror, nail-biting suspense & persistently looming paranoia, John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the greatest films of its genre(s) that presents its esteemed filmmaker at the apex of his talents for the remarkable simplicity with which Carpenter succeeds in infusing the storyline with a chilling sense of dread, tension & uncertainty right from its opening moments and then effortlessly sustaining those vital horror elements throughout the film's runtime is no mere achievement in itself.Set in Antarctica, the story of The Thing follows the crew of an American research facility whose expedition is interrupted when a couple of seemingly delusional Norwegians barge into their station while pursuing & shooting a dog, and are killed in defence. But when the dog mutates and reveals its true identity, the crew deduces that they are being confronted by a parasitic alien lifeform that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them perfectly. With no one really sure of who's human & who's the imitator among them, paranoia develops within the group.Directed by John Carpenter (the mastermind behind Assault on Precinct 13 & Halloween), The Thing is without a doubt my favourite film of his. The plot creates an atmosphere of impending doom right from the beginning as we can sense that something is definitely not right with the dog, and thanks to the minimal but menacing track that accompanies that sequence, the build-up is quick & effective. Bill Lancaster's screenplay deserves a mention too for it retains the mystery from start to finish, keeps the premise unpredictable & although the characters aren't fleshed out that well, they do have an identity.The technical aspects further help in setting the film's desired tone & atmosphere, starting with its isolated set pieces that have this sort of a raw, unrefined feel to it which, in addition to its remote location, cleverly brings the element of claustrophobia into the narrative. Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera for the wisely chosen angles, minimal lighting & slow but fluid movements encapsulate the whole picture with an unsettling vibe which only amplifies as the story progresses. Editing is carried out in a very methodical manner as it allows the suspense to settle in at its own pace and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout its 109 minutes of runtime.The work in the special effects & make-up department might have been groundbreaking during its time of release but it looks a tad dated now and at times, unintentionally funny as well and yet it fits & work in favour of this narrative for the most part. However, the most impressive aspect of The Thing in my opinion is its background score, composed by Ennio Morricone. What's amazing about the soundtrack is that it sounds exactly the way Carpenter himself would've scored it, with simple, synthesised tracks that help enhance the sinister mood of the picture and elevate it to a nerve-wracking level. It's quite possibly the best John Carpenter score that wasn't composed by John Carpenter.Coming to the performances, Kurt Russell spearheads the rest of the cast with a good show and plays the role of the research team's helicopter pilot. The script doesn't delve into the background of its various characters but it does give each one of these scripted people their deserving moment on the screen. There is much similarity to Ridley Scott's Alien as far as its casting goes for each character has a role to play here and even if we don't get to know enough about any of them, their predicament and the situation they find themselves in on the isolated continent is deeply felt. Also, both Russell & the rest of the supporting cast do well with what they're given and deliver truly convincing performances.On an overall scale, The Thing is as suspenseful as any cinema can get. It deserves to be ranked amongst the greatest horror films ever made, has aged amazingly well over the years despite its dated effects and still remains John Carpenter's finest directional effort to date. It may not be scary on a visceral level but its tense ambiance, claustrophobic setting & the omnipresent danger of the unknown can run havoc on the senses plus it leaves enough pieces for viewers to put together once the whole story has concluded. Immortal for its contribution to cinema, absolutely living up to its legacy, and continuing to inspire & influence modern chillers, John Carpenter's magnum opus is one chiller no horror fanatic should miss out on.

The Revenant," Extremely Bleak, Exceedingly Brutal & Exceptionally Cold-Blooded
","Extremely bleak, exceedingly brutal & exceptionally cold-blooded, The Revenant is that savage beast that charges at you with relentless fury, mauls you from head to toe without mercy, and leaves you utterly bruised, broken & helpless in the freezing cold of a harsh winter. Absolutely uncompromising with its content, unflinchingly raw in its depiction, and pushing its cast & crew to their limit, Alejandro G. Iñárritu's latest is one of the most harrowing films ever made.Inspired by true events & based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Revenant takes place in the 1820s and follows Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who, during the expedition of the uncharted American wilderness, gets viciously attacked by a bear and is left for dead by members of his hunting team. In an effort to survive, Glass endures unimaginable grief & extreme winter conditions in order to bring vengeance upon those who betrayed him & also murdered his son.Co-written & directed by Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu who's distinguished for his ruthless, evocative style of filmmaking, bleak subject matters, and themes relating to death, loss & redemption, The Revenant exhibits all these trademarks and is quite possibly his most distressing film to date for Iñárritu here aims to capture the pain & suffering in the harshest of conditions in the most unforgivable manner possible, and delivers a cinema that's undeniably difficult to endure but also hard to look away from.The script packs in an icy cold revenge dish set against the backdrop of remorseless surroundings in an era marred with conflict, carnage & cruelty. The punishing cold, desolate locations & lack of civilisation brings an authenticity of its own. The whole film is shot using only natural light and with Emmanuel Lubezki behind the camera, each frame is crisply photographed, the cold colour palette is brilliantly utilised, and there are several long takes that make you wonder how those sequences were filmed with such effectiveness.Clocking in at 156 minutes, The Revenant is a long film to sit through but the drama manages to be so absorbing that its lengthy runtime is barely felt. The slow pace allows it to be a more immersive experience, and also helping the ordeal is its arresting cinematography which works in contrast with the unadulterated brutality that's on display here. The background score is mesmerising and emits a sense of warmth but it makes its presence felt only intermittently. However, those flashback scenes don't add much to the story and should've been left out.Coming to the performances, The Revenant features an excellent cast in Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter, and this is one aspect that plays to Iñárritu's strengths as a filmmaker. DiCaprio delivers a powerhouse performance that makes the viewers feel every bit of agony his character undergoes in what is, without a shadow of a doubt, his toughest on-screen work to date as this actor gives his all to play his role from inside out. Hardy is no slouch in his supporting role and plays the antagonist with great restraint, while Gleeson & others do well with what they are given.On an overall scale, The Revenant is another gritty, unrelenting & audacious piece of filmmaking from Alejandro G. Iñárritu that finds the director in sublime form and also happens to be his most direct & accessible film to date. Definitely not for the easily distressed, this thrilling story of survival & retribution is destined to upset many viewers with its graphic nature of storytelling but for those who can manage to stay on board, it will be rewarding on more levels than one. Marking another artistic high for both Iñárritu & Lubezki and catapulted to a greater level by DiCaprio's extraordinary performance, The Revenant is one of the finest films of 2015 and certainly one of the proudest in the careers of its cast & crew.

Bridge of Spies," A Riveting Espionage Thriller That's Consistently Thrilling Despite Its Lack Of Action
","Marking the fourth collaboration between Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks, Bridge of Spies is an elegantly crafted, cleverly narrated & sincerely performed spy-thriller from the esteemed filmmaker who, even in what can be termed as his semi-retirement phase, continues to thrill & surprise us with stories that may not be as magical as his best works but still make up for an enriching experience.Inspired by true events, the story of Bridge of Spies is set in the 1960s during the Cold War and follows an insurance lawyer who is recruited to defend a Soviet spy, to give the illusion of a fair trial which in actuality turns out to be completely one-sided. But when an American spy plane pilot is caught by the Soviets, he's asked by the CIA to facilitate the exchange of spies between the two hostile nations.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Bridge of Spies continues his recent fascination with setting a drama around historical events and is another masterful work from the notable filmmaker that's thoroughly captivating from start to finish. While the story is dialogue-driven, the film has the structure of a cat-and-mouse game that keeps the interest alive and is wonderfully anchored by sensible performances from its cast.Production design team does a splendid job in recreating the timeline its story is set in with all the necessary details in place. Cinematography follows the mantra that other dramas by Spielberg carry and brilliantly reflects the grim period with its slightly darkened images. The pacing is steady and top-notch editing ensures that only relevant moments stay in the final print. Also, it's is one of those rare Spielberg flicks that's not scored by John Williams but Thomas Newman does well to fill up the void.Coming to the performances, Bridge of Spies features a much mature & dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Alan Alda & others, amongst which Hanks & Rylance impress the most. Hanks is at his usual best in the role of James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer assigned to defend the arrested Soviet spy in the court and later helps in negotiating a prisoner exchange deal between US & USSR. Rylance plays the Soviet spy with effortless ease and owns almost every scene he appears in.On an overall scale, Bridge of Spies is a refreshing entry in the genre of espionage thrillers that's deftly scripted and confidently brought to life under Spielberg's assured direction & Hanks' reliable performance. The plot brims with political tension, has its own set of twists n turns, and is consistently gripping despite its lack of action. The year of 2015 has already seen its fair share of spy-thrillers but Bridge of Spies is definitely amongst the best ones to surface and marks another successful collaboration between Spielberg & Hanks.

Split," M. Night Shyamalan's Road To Recovery Continues With Yet Another Competently Crafted Horror
","From the writer-director of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable & The Visit, Split is a small-scale psychological horror that marks another right step in M. Night Shyamalan's road to recovery and finds him making skillful use of his rediscovered creativity & passion to put up a simple structured, competently crafted & morbidly humoured chiller that's dark, mysterious & wickedly amusing.The story of Split follows a trio of teenage girls who are abducted by a man diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and who has manifested a total of 23 different personalities so far. With no one to rely on but each other, the girls try to compel one of his identities to help them escape and must do so before the emergence of a far sinister & frightful 24th persona.Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan whose filmmaking career has seen both soaring highs & crushing lows, Split is a more confidently executed feature from him that makes efficient use of all his trademarks, and keeps its tense vibe alive from beginning to end. The characters do lack flesh on their arcs and are thinly sketched but their predicament is still relatable to an extent.Shot majorly in a single location, the isolated setting do bring a sense of unease into the story and it is further enhanced by its smooth handling, sharp focus & controlled movements of the camera. Editing briskly paces its 117 minutes narrative, few scenes are drawn out longer than expected and its eerie tone rarely goes away. The film keeps throwing surprises throughout its runtime and few of them manage to stick.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley & Haley Lu Richardson, with McAvoy & Taylor-Joy chipping in with commendable work. Not all the 23 identities appear but McAvoy does well with whichever ones make it to the final print. Taylor-Joy is just as good if not more and the moments between the two make up for the film's best segments, plus it only gets better as plot progresses.On an overall scale, Split is a well-directed, well-scripted & well-performed horror that may not be as memorable as the finest examples of its genre or even Shyamalan's best works but it definitely ranks as one of his better directional efforts. Enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying, Split is a thrilling ride that keeps the viewers engaged in its premise from start to finish and wraps itself up with a game-changing final twist that no one saw coming. And for that alone, it's worth a watch.",Null,1,10,7 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The End Begins
","Based on the final novel of the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows marks the end of an era that saw an entire generation grow up with this deeply fascinating world of magic. Presented in 2 parts, it is the finale of what eventually became a worldwide phenomenon during the first decade of the 21st century, both in the world of books & cinema.Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 finds the trio of Harry, Ron & Hermione embarking on a new journey to finish Dumbledore's work by finding & destroying the remaining horcruxes of Lord Voldemort. And in their grim adventure where danger awaits at every corner, they come to learn about the Deathly Hallows while The Dark Lord prepares to take over the Wizarding World.The direction by David Yates is pretty good as the film adapts the novel very faithfully this time & in much greater detail. But it's also slowed down by most of the action being moved on to the final chapter. The technical aspects continue to impress once again as it properly balances its story while Alexandre Desplat's score brings a flavour of its own into the film although it remains within the realms of this magical world.Coming to the performances, the focus is finally on the three primary leads of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson and each one of them chips in with a performance that's highly improved compared to its predecessors. Yet, in my opinion, it's Helena Bonham Carter in her sinister portrayal of Bellatrix Lestrange who enters the film during its final moments & still ends up stealing the show with her terrific performance.On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is incredibly faithful to its source material, has moments of action in bits n pieces but the focus this time is mainly on the drama than visuals and it also features an amazing work of animation in one scene that's easily my favourite moment. It might turn out to be boring for some but for me it lays down the perfect groundwork for the next chapter. Certainly not the best of the series but definitely not the worst either.",Null,0,2,23 July 2014
Kung Fu Panda 2," A Rollicking, Ravishing & Riveting Second Chapter That Lives Up To Its Hype.
","Making excellent use of all the ingredients that made its predecessor an instant classic, the follow- up chapter to Kung Fu Panda is another rollicking, ravishing & riveting adventure that lives up to its hype, adds more depth & flesh to the arcs of all reprising characters, further expands the world we dived into in the first film, and is a worthy sequel that even surpasses the original in few aspects.The story of Kung Fu Panda 2 presents Po now living his fulfilled dream, serving as the Dragon Warrior, & protecting the valley with his fellow kung fu warriors whom he once idolised. His latest adventure begins when Lord Shen returns from exile with a fearsome new weapon & has plans of conquering all of China, following which Po & his friends attempt to stop him before he could destroy the entire kung fu tradition.Directed by Jennifer Yuh in what is her directional debut, the film begins on a promising note with a prologue that quickly briefs us through the villain's background & how all of it is connected to Po's very own past, after which it dives into the present and sets the stage relatively quick, just like the previous feature. For a first attempt, Yuh's direction is highly commendable for she exhibits a very firm grip on all aspects.The writing staff does an equally impressive job with the script by further evolving the characters' arcs, brilliantly balancing the elements of comedy, drama & action in one tightly-structured story & putting up a better sketch of the Chinese culture. The computer animation is lively, zestful & more complex than before, thanks to its energetic camera-work, rich colour tones & apt lighting that give its images a vivacious look n feel.Editing is carried out amazingly well for its 90 minutes of narrative is expertly paced yet there are a couple of moments it could've done without. The flashback sequences are brought to life with care and a few of those segments are genuinely touching. Hans Zimmer & John Powell contribute with a familiar yet improved score. And Jack Black plus the rest of the reprising cast deliver exactly what was expected from them while the new additions are no slouch in their given roles.On an overall scale, Kung Fu Panda 2 heads into a slightly darker territory but it never discards the effervescent wit, unbridled passion & unadulterated quality of the original in doing so. Packing in just as much fun, madness & awesomeness as the first film, exquisitely steered under Yuh's direction, and marking another creative high for DreamWorks Animation, Kung Fu Panda 2 is another triumph of its genre that's highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying from the first frame to the last.

American Psycho," An Intriguing Blend Of Comedy & Horror That Rides High On Christian Bale's Knockout Performance!
","A social satire on the materialistic, self-obsessed & greed-driven upper society of the 1980s America which also mocks male narcissism, American Psycho presents a community made up of people who have all the luxury that money can buy yet no individuality of their own, a world where everyone looks, dresses & acts exactly the same and measure themselves only by their external appearances & material possessions.Based on the novel of the same name, American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman; a wealthy, narcissistic & material-obsessed investment banker living in New York during the late 1980s who's a stereotype of the yuppie generation & leads a secret life as a serial killer. But the mask of outer perfection he's put up so well to hide his psychopathic persona from his co-workers & friends begins to slip when he delves deeper into his darker fantasies.Co-written & directed by Mary Harron, American Psycho is a captivating study of a madman who simultaneously obsesses & criticises the shallow culture he's a part of and attempts to hide his chaotic personal life through excessive vanity & beautification. Harron's direction is good for she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction & reality and although the ambiguity is maintained for the most part, it inadvertently falls apart in the final act.The screenplay is no slouch for the story maintains its stringent focus on its lead character, who is present in every scene of the movie. Everything is told from Bateman's perspective and it is through his decadent lifestyle that the writers are critiquing the hedonistic society he simply happens to be a byproduct of. The script also showcases a fine balance between the elements of comedy & horror and there are moments which will be disturbing to few but hilarious to others for the exact same reason.Production design team does a stellar job with extravagant-looking set pieces that suit the environment this film tries to establish. Cinematography is much dependent on which side of Bateman we are witnessing for the camera exhibits calm, controlled movements when he appears normal and turns chaotic whenever he reveals his true face. Editing steadily paces the whole story and sustains the ambiguous nature of the unfolding events to some extent. Lastly, the soundtrack cleverly puts together some existing songs that ties into its events.Coming to the performances, American Psycho features an excellent cast in Christian Bale, Chloë Sevigny, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon & others, and all of them are thoroughly convincing in their given roles. Bale however takes it to another level with a truly committed act that finds the actor transforming his body to match the physical aspects of his character and then diving into the psyche of a psychopath. He's also responsible for the humour that forms an integral part of the story and while he's well supported by the rest of the cast, this is his show all the way.On an overall scale, American Psycho is an intriguing blend of comedy & horror that rides high on Christian Bale's knockout performance which ultimately brushes away many of its shortcomings. The equivocal aspect of this tale is almost destroyed by its poorly executed final act and is destined to compel most viewers to incline towards a simpler interpretation. But if one takes into account the mistaken identity theme, which is consistently addressed throughout the movie, then its satirisation of the 1980s yuppie-greed culture gains an even greater depth. Although its impact lessens on every subsequent viewing, American Psycho nevertheless deserves a watch or two for Bale's swashbuckling inputs alone. Don't miss it.",Null,0,1,28 October 2015
North by Northwest," When It Comes to Thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock is Second to None.
","Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest features a spellbinding first half which makes terrific use of clever humour, elevated tension & elements of mystery or suspense but is unfortunately marred by a lacklustre second half which bogs the story down with a dragged narrative & feels slightly overlong in the end although it does have one spectacular sequence that'll be etched in memory once it's seen.One of the first films to lay down the foundation of modern action thrillers in Hollywood, North by Northwest is a thrilling tale of mistaken identity which concerns an innocent advertising executive who is mistaken for a government agent by an organisation of foreign spies & is pursued by them. The story covers his journey of survival as danger & betrayal await at every corner.Although the film is nicely directed & does boast some high moments, it nonetheless ends up feeling like a mixed bag as the story ends up overstaying its welcome and the ending feels more extended than it was required. The screenplay is deftly written, camera-work is dynamic from its opening moments, editing could've paced the second half better & Bernard Herrmann's score is expertly composed.Coming to the performances, Cary Grant is absolutely professional in his role & dons the character's suit smoothly. Plus, he is wonderfully supported by other actors who deliver fine performances in their given roles. On an overall scale, North by Northwest is an intriguing & entertaining flick from Hitchcock that didn't work out for me as well as I would've liked but is still an effective example of its genre that's definitely worth a watch.",Null,1,2,7 October 2013
Hugo," Martin Scorsese's Love Letter To Cinema Is Both Endearing & Frustrating
","An endearing love letter to the cinematic art form advertised as a big-budget, family-friendly adventure to its audience, Martin Scorsese's Hugo dazzles & captivates with its exquisite use of 3D photography but the wizardry it conjures in the art direction & cinematography section is missing on the storytelling front, for the narrative is slow, stale & devoid of compelling characters. And though the film captures the magic of moviemaking in all its glamour & glory, its wandering plot, clunky narration, bland characterisation, glacial pace & overlong runtime results in a dull, flat, tedious & emotionally vapid experience that will test the patience of many, if not all.",Null,1,1,25 February 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," An Unrefined, Unimpressive & Unnecessary Addition To The Terminator Saga.
","An unrefined, unimpressive & unnecessary addition to the saga that was fully told by James Cameron in the first two films, Terminator 3: Rise of Machines arrives as the second sequel to an already finished series that tries to kill the validity of a highly influential franchise & succeeds to a certain extent, and remains one of the most disappointing sequels in cinema history.Following the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the story of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is set in the year 2004 in which Skynet once again sends another Terminator back in time to kill the future high-ranking members of human resistance after it is unable to locate the position of John Connor while a reprogrammed T-850 model arrives from the future as a protector of John & his future wife, Kate.Directed by Jonathan Mostow, Terminator 3 is an insipid, stupid & inferior sequel that lacks everything which made its predecessors two of the most groundbreaking films in the genre of action & sci-fi. The screenplay is marred by its poor storytelling, dull dialogues, complete lack of depth, terrible characterisation, forgettable villain & soulless action, which gets even worse with the lifeless performance its cast puts up.Despite the advancement in filmmaking technology over the years, its technical aspects are no match to the first two chapters of the franchise. Camera-work is all over the place, for it is impressive in a few sequences & absolutely dodgy at other moments. Editing makes the film a tedious affair to sit through, visual effects is highly inferior in comparison & the score by Marco Beltrami isn't that captivating either.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Kristanna Loken & Claire Danes and not one of them manage to leave a lasting impression. Schwarzenegger's character is ineffectively handled, Loken's T-X is a major step back after the indestructible T-800 of the first film & the invincible T-1000 of the second while Stahl & Danes are very mediocre in the roles of John Connor & his future wife Kate, respectively.On an overall scale, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is one sequel that had no reason to exist other than to dent the legacy of the remarkable universe its first two films created. It only goes on to show just how vital James Cameron's input was to this series & without his vision, it's just another cashgrab sequel trying to milk out the franchise for all its worth. The film sure has a couple of stunning moments but for the most part, the process of sitting through Rise of the Machines feels wholly redundant. Worth skipping.",Null,1,5,28 June 2015
The Orphanage," A Tale of Love. A Story of Horror.
","Ingeniously weighing the elements of supernatural & psychological horror, The Orphanage is an expertly crafted horror film from Cinema of Spain which with its welcome absence of cheap scares & more emphasis on its plot turns out to be one of the finest examples of its genre. Cleverly plotted, it dares to take its time to create the required atmosphere rather than prematurely rushing into scaring its audience like so many horror films do nowadays.The Orphanage concerns Laura; a former orphan who returns with her husband & son back to her childhood home which used to be an orphanage for handicapped children, which she hopes to reopen again. Things are set in motion when her son Simon, who claims to have invisible friends, goes missing one day after an altercation with her. Convinced of others' presence in the house, Laura tries to uncover the secrets about the orphanage that dates back to the time when she used to live here with the hope that it may provide some hint about her son's whereabouts..Directed by J. A. Bayona, The Orphanage is his debut feature & he has done a really good job with the provided story. The film is very well scripted too with proper time devoted to its lead character & her plight, and it also benefits from its arresting cinematography, smart editing, sincere performances & outstanding use of sound as well as its score. On an overall scale, The Orphanage is an intelligently crafted chiller that scares as well as amazes & is primarily a tale of how far a mother is willing to go to find her son.

The Shining," Arguably The Most Aesthetic, Artistic & Accomplished Of All Horror Films!
","Arguably the most aesthetic, artistic & accomplished of all horror films, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is another masterwork of precision craftsmanship that presents the gifted filmmaker at his prime as he smoothly blends the elements of supernatural & psychological horror into one methodically structured & meticulously layered story whose underlying themes & narrative complexity has spawned numerous interpretations over the years and remains a subject of discussion amongst film buffs even today.The Shining tells the story of Jack Torrance, a former teacher who takes the caretaker's job at the Overlook Hotel which tends to stay closed during the winter season. Arriving at the remote location with his wife & son, Jack intends to use the solitude of the hotel to pursue his passion for writing but once the family settle into the hotel, his condition worsens as he begins to act strangely, suffers from writer's block, becomes prone to violent outbursts & is constantly haunted by the supernatural entity that reside there.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, The Shining is his first stint with horror and yet he exhibits a far better understanding of this genre than most established directors of horror cinema. From the opening moments, the film is able to establish an ominous mood thanks to the eerie score that accompanies its title sequence and the aerial photography that finds its camera hovering over those rocky mountains, lush landscapes & narrow roads leading to the Overlook Hotel, thus already foreshadowing the isolation that awaits the Torrance familyThe technical aspects in almost every Kubrick film is carried out with precision care and The Shining is no exception. Production design team deserves kudos for the meticulously designed set pieces for it provides the hotel an identity of its own. Cinematography makes very inventive use of its camera & follows our characters like a silent observer at all times while the fluid movements, clever angles, steady zooms, perfect lighting & aptly chosen colour tones greatly amplify the whole look & feel of the picture. The real highlight however is how the Steadicam is utilised.Kubrick here pushes the Steadicam to its extreme to achieve a smoothness & stability that hasn't been replicated ever since. The flexibility & sleek flow provided by this new technique didn't just allow the director to stage some of modern cinema's most iconic shots but also brings the viewers into the story by placing them behind the characters as the plot unfolds. Editing is a strong highlight too for almost every scene ends up playing a relevant role in the story. And the background score is in perfect sync with each & every moment and elevates the whole experience by encapsulating the entire film with a highly unsettling mood.With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, Jack Torrance already looks like someone who's just waiting for a little push to descend into total madness which doesn't come off as a surprise when it eventually happens. The stressful experience Shelley Duvall underwent during its production is well-documented but the effect of it all can be felt in her rendition of a broken Wendy, as the entire ordeal only helped her performance. And Danny Lloyd plays their psychic kid and just like every kid in almost every horror film, he's annoying to an extent. All three actors are over-the-top at times but this added exaggeration somehow works in the film's favour.On an overall scale, The Shining is a thought-provoking meditation on madness, isolation & paranoia that defies everything that was usually a norm in the genre of horror back then yet puts on screen a cinema that is now regarded as a definitive example of atmospheric horror. Immortal for its contribution to horror, a staple of pop culture, and a classic amalgamation of superb direction, deft writing, innovative camera-work, skillful editing, menacing score & devoted performances, The Shining remains one of the greatest achievements of its genre that's only getting better with time and is definitely amongst Stanley Kubrick's finest works. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.",Null,5,8,19 October 2015

Warrior," One of the Greatest Sports Movies Ever Made.
","A powerhouse of strong emotions, rousing action & gut-wrenching drama, Warrior is an ingeniously crafted & expertly balanced tale that bears every genre-cliché in its plot, has a predictable storyline and yet it manages to leave most of its viewers emotionally drained & immensely satisfied in the end. The dark horse of its year that came out of nowhere to surprise & stun almost everyone, this underrated masterpiece is in my opinion one of the greatest sports films ever made.The story concerns two estranged brothers who enter the MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) tournament & covers their struggling relationship with each other as well as their father. Dealing with the themes of redemption, forgiveness & indomitable will of the human spirit in a thoughtful manner, Warrior is heavy on the emotional side of the drama that makes us really care for its deftly scripted characters which in turn makes its action segments all the more intense, gripping & compelling.Written & directed by Gavin O'Connor, the movie is brilliantly directed with O'Connor perfectly weighing the emotional drama with brutal fight sequences both in the script & its execution on the film canvas. Cinematography is another plus as it makes excellent use of camera angles, focus & tracking shots to immerse us into its story while editing paces the whole film in a vigilant manner. And I've got nothing but praise for Mark Isham's remarkable score that keeps the emotions, tension & excitement alive from start to finish.Coming to the performances, Warrior features a reliable cast in Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy & Nick Nolte and all three have done a fabulous job in their given roles. Although Edgerton is the most stable of the three just like his character in the film, Tom Hardy is absolutely sensational, brutal & unstoppable in his role while Nick Nolte packs in with an intensely emotional performance as their father. Add to that, the MMA fight scenes are pretty accurate in its depiction, the ring-side commentary is even better & the entire tournament makes us cheer like our favourite sport does in real life.Above anything else, I think the best thing about Warrior is its overall treatment & the sincere manner in which it explores its themes. The first half of the story beautifully lays down the groundwork for the next half by placing significant emphasis on its characters & their lives. Each characters' emotions, motivation & decision has a genuine feel to it and so when it all inevitably explodes during the tournament, the knockout punch is strongly felt and in the end, it becomes all the more difficult to choose a side as we don't want either to lose.On an overall scale, Warrior should be used as a template for anyone looking to make a sports film. It takes its drama seriously, it deals with its sport segments in an authentic manner & it explores its themes without stuffing it in your face. Superbly directed, deftly written, skilfully photographed, tightly edited, magnificently scored & packed with vibrant performances, Warrior is one of the best films of its year, one of the prime examples of its genre & one of the most rewarding cinematic payoffs in recent memory. Strongly recommended.",Null,2,4,6 August 2014
Judgment at Nuremberg," Strongly, Extremely & Essentially Recommended.
","Judgment at Nuremberg has been a part of my collection for sometime but every time I thought of checking it out, its 3 hours of runtime would always end up altering my decision even though I'm generally game for World War II events, especially the stuff related to Holocaust & Nazi Germany. But after watching it at last, I've got one thing to say; the 3 hours simply fly by.Inspired by one of the cases that took place during the Nuremberg trials, Judgment at Nuremberg concerns the trial of 4 Judges who served before & during the Nazi regime in Germany and who either passively or actively abused their offices to conduct Nazi's racial policy which eventually resulted in the extermination of millions of people across Europe.Ingeniously directed by Stanley Kramer, the film as a whole is one of the most important works in cinema that goes through both sides of the same coin where the prosecutor wants to blame the entire nation for Nazi's crimes against humanity while the defense attorney is fighting for the little glory that he can abstract for his country which is already going through a lot of humiliation, suffering & guilt.Over the course of its 3 hours of runtime, the film raises some interesting questions about the social or political nature of the crimes these judges were being tried for, the factors that may have influenced or affected their decisions, the geo-political complexity of the whole ongoing trial, the understanding required about Germany's own state that led to Hitler's rise in power & the secrecy with which the entire extermination process was carried out.The script is masterfully written by Abby Mann who wisely weighs the arguments of both sides & let the viewers come to their own conclusions. The camera-work is equally fascinating, especially in the courtroom sequences where it would pan around continuously but then instantly zoom & focus on a particular character, thus alerting its viewers to pay more attention during that vital moment. Editing paces the story so well that the 3 hours of runtime is never felt & the music gets its own moments to shine as well.Coming to the performances, the quality of work done by its ensemble cast is of the highest order & every single actor ends up giving his/her best shot. Even the tertiary cast ends up packing a punch for the mere small details like shivering of hands or lump in throat while talking or fear or embarrassment in their eyes end up providing an immense amount of authenticity to the whole narrative. And the performances from its main cast effortlessly takes it to the next level.Spencer Tracy plays the Chief Judge presiding over the trial & in a way, he depicts us viewers because just like him, we're supposed to hear both sides of the case & come to a decision that's not an easy one to make. And Tracy perfectly balances kindness, charm & authority to deliver an admirable performance here. Burt Lancaster is a silent spectator for the most part but when he gets to speak, he leaves a lasting impression. Yet it's actually Maximillian Schell who completely steals the show with his highly energetic performance as German defense attorney Hans Rolfe.On an overall scale, Judgment at Nuremberg isn't an easy film to pass a judgment upon. The subject matter it deals with & the points it brings on the table really makes you question both justice & fairness and leaves many things to ponder about even when it's finished. Thought- provoking, deeply affecting & profoundly moving, Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the most significant works in cinema history that's strongly, extremely & essentially recommended.",Null,0,1,12 September 2014
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The Quintessential Sequel, The Quintessential Sci-Fi Action & One Of Cinema's Greatest Triumphs
","The quintessential sequel, the quintessential sci-fi actioner & one of the greatest films ever made, James Cameron's follow-up story to his breakthrough classic presents such a huge upgrade over its predecessor that it ends up decimating the 1984 original in all filmmaking departments with effortless ease, and remains one of the most influential, entertaining & breathtaking action extravaganzas to grace the silver screen.A highly irresistible, pulse-pounding, high-octane, full-throttled & top-gear action spectacle that's filled with some of the most dangerous, daring & heart-stopping stunts ever captured on the film celluloid, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the perfect definition of a worthy sequel that presents its renowned director at the peak of his gifted talents, is the finest work of his illustrious career, and its influence on its genre, visual effects & pop culture surpasses even the reach of its predecessor.The story of Terminator 2: Judgment Day follows the aftermath of the events that transpired in The Terminator and continues the journey of Sarah Connor & her 10-year old son, John Connor; the future leader of human resistance in the war against the machines. After failing to eliminate Sarah during its first attempt, Skynet sends a much more advanced Terminator back in time to kill John while he's still a child while another saviour from the future arrives with a mission is to protect John & ensure his survival at all costs.Written, produced & directed by James Cameron, the improvements present in this sequel are evident from the film's opening moments with more enhanced visuals, larger-than-life action & one mind-blowing sequence after another. I've always admired Cameron because he's one of the very few filmmakers who understands what great action is all about, knows how to expand upon the original instead of rehashing the same events & has the talent to accomplish not just his own artistic ambitions but also the expectations of the mainstream audience without compromising with the quality.From a technical standpoint, Terminator 2 is a marvel of genre filmmaking in every sense of the word. Production Design team does a commendable job with its refined sets, locations are nicely selected for filming especially when it comes to action scenes, Cinematography makes expert use of its camera in keeping the action clearly visible with its cleverly chosen angles, makes the drama more immersive with its smart movements and with its precision use of colour hues & lighting provides a rich texture to the whole film that further enhances the whole experience.Editing is easily one of its strongest aspects for every sequence paves the groundwork for the next scene in line, even the flow of events is incredibly smooth & relaxed, and the pace is so methodically handled that its 136 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Brad Fiedel also comes up with a more evolved, pulsating & fitting score that beautifully integrates into the film's narrative and has a firm grip on the viewers' emotions from start to finish. But where Terminator 2 sets an entirely new benchmark is in its visual effects, sound design & action choreography, all of which are simply groundbreaking.Although Jurassic Park is cited by many as the picture that revolutionised the film industry with its pioneering use of computer-generated-imagery, it was actually this film that made the necessary breakthroughs in CGI which made the former possible. The practical effects are even more impressive for there are plenty of death-defying stunts present in its action & its choreography still remains in a league of its own. The only other film that comes close to duplicating the same feat is the recently released Mad Max: Fury Road but even that post- apocalyptic mayhem lacks the meticulous refinement Cameron brings to this film's story & characters.Coming to the performances, Terminator 2 features a solid cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick & Edward Furlong, with the reprising actors improving upon their performances in the last chapter while new ones instantly making a mark in their given roles. Schwarzenegger returns as the cyborg sent from the future but with a new mission & while T-800 isn't the same relentless assassin in this sequel, there isn't a moment when we aren't aware of his strength. Schwarzenegger gets to take his character to other directions this time and does a spectacular job at it for T-800 isn't just badass in this picture but also cool, charismatic & heroic.Linda Hamilton reprises her role of Sarah Connor and builds upon her earlier rendition with a stronger performance as her character exhibits a more evolved & tougher persona, which Hamilton captures splendidly. Edward Furlong is introduced as John Connor & while he can be annoying on few occasions, it's a dream debut nonetheless. And finally we have Robert Patrick who is in as T-1000; a highly advanced cyborg who's far superior to T-800 model & is virtually the most lethal, unstoppable, indestructible & invincible Terminator in existence. Cameron has written the part of this antagonist really well and Patrick's added inputs help greatly in making his character one of the greatest film villains of all time.On an overall scale, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is blockbuster filmmaking at its finest for it sets a very high standard for its genre(s) that hasn't been equalled ever since, remains one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & jaw-dropping works of sci-fi action with an extremely high repeat value, is a perfect example of a sequel that surpasses the original in all aspects, is a landmark achievement of genre filmmaking that has had a lasting impact on multimedia & pop culture. The best film of its year, one of the most memorable films of the 1990s & one of cinema's greatest triumphs, James Cameron's conclusion to his Terminator saga is an unprecedented, unrivalled & undisputed masterpiece that comes strongly recommended.",Null,2,4,24 June 2015
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now Redux
","The following is the review of Apocalypse Now Redux & not the original 1979 version.The manic masterpiece that burnt every single creative brain cell of director Francis Ford Coppola returned to big screen after 2 decades with nearly 50 minutes of additional & never-seen-before footage. But the big question is if the new version is all its worth or not? If it in anyway pushes forward the unprecedented legacy of the original version or diminishes it? Although, Coppola went ahead with the Redux version thinking that this is the version people will remember his magnum opus as, it certainly didn't turn out to be as planned.Apocalypse Now Redux, in my opinion, is quite inferior to the original 1979 version for a number of reasons. First, it slows down the entire film by a great deal. Second, it doesn't add anything that changes the overall impact of the film. And third, many of the new scenes added are boring & in some ways a little deviation from the tightly structured & meticulously edited original plot. Although, it does connect many dots that were missing in the original & many new scenes help the character development process, its 202 minutes of runtime is deeply felt.If you haven't seen Apocalypse Now yet then go for the original 1979 version instead of this one. Apocalypse Now Redux can exclusively be enjoyed by only the die-hard maniacs of the original film. Even after 22 years, it's clearly visible that Coppola still hasn't fully recovered from what the traumatic production of this film did to him as the creativity in the re-editing isn't that classic anymore. Overall, Apocalypse Now Redux is still as hallucinatory & majestic a film as the 1979 version but is strictly for die-hard fans of the original than new viewers.",Null,0,2,12 December 2013
The Battle of Algiers," An Informing, Historical & Essential Piece Of World Cinema
","Far ahead of its time & surprisingly exceptional work of filmmaking, The Battle of Algiers is a boldly crafted, highly gripping & powerfully narrated tale depicting the revolutionary events that triggered the Algerian struggle for independence from France after 130 years of colonial rule and is one of world cinema's treasured gems to grace the film canvas.Filmed in bleak black n white that crisply captures the plot's gritty atmosphere while also providing it an ageless look & shot in an informing style that almost qualifies it as a spellbinding documentary, The Battle of Algiers leaves no stone unturned to expose the violence, suppression & brutality the Algerian citizens had to endure which only fuelled their desire for complete freedom.The direction, writing, performances, cinematography & music as well as the research & detailing of events that went into its making are absolutely high-grade stuffs which in the end resulted in an extremely satisfying cinematic experience. On an overall scale, The Battle of Algiers is a brilliant study of guerrilla warfare and is an informing, historical & essential piece of world cinema that has effortlessly coped with the test of time & hasn't lost an edge, even to this date.Unquestionably deserving a watch or two from every cinema lover around the world, The Battle of Algiers is strongly recommended.",Null,0,1,9 August 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," A Sound Tale of Unsound Characters.
","A sound tale of two unsound characters, Silver Linings Playbook is a tightly structured & wonderfully scripted film by David O.

But all his plans soon go for a toss when he meets Tiffany, a girl with problems of her own, as the two embark on a love/hate friendship based solely on their own selfish reasons.David O.

The White Ribbon," The Origin Of Cruelty In Every Society.
","Carefully digging into the origin of what generally lets violence & cruelty seep into our society, The White Ribbon (also known as Das weiße Band) is an elegantly crafted, meticulously shot & patiently narrated drama from writer-director Michael Haneke that's thought-provoking, disturbing & riveting at the same time, and is presented in a manner that's destined to polarise its audience.Set in a fictional village of Germany, taking place just before the onset of First World War & narrated by the schoolteacher who once used to live there, the story of The White Ribbon concerns the suppressed children of the villagers who seem to be at the heart of a series of bizarre incidents, having the characteristics of a punishment ritual, occurring in their village.Written & directed by Michael Haneke, the film has an eerie, mysterious vibe to it from the very beginning and is sufficiently aided by its crisp, dark & greyscale photography. Performances are no doubt terrific but what's definitely going to test its viewers & is sure to leave them either absolutely fascinated or utterly frustrated is its painfully slow pace, uncertain conclusion & moral ambiguity.On an overall scale, The White Ribbon is a masterly controlled, skilfully directed & exquisitely performed art-house feature that captures the root of everything evil in a brutally honest manner & shows that people aren't born as sadists or monsters but are turned into one by the very individuals they put their faith in, and that the seeds of an inhuman society are planted a long time before it begins sprouting on the surface.",Null,0,2,9 August 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Rare Example of A Hollywood Remake Done Right.
","It's not very often that you come across a Hollywood remake that's almost as amazing as the original film & in that particular aspect, David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a winner. Dark, brutal, sinister yet intensely engaging & viciously entertaining, the film is crafted with sublime aggressiveness from start to finish & also marks Fincher's return to the genre he does better than anyone else.Based on Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo concerns Mikael Blomkvist; a disgraced journalist who's hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate the disappearance & assumed murder of his grandniece, which happened 40 years ago. As he delves deeper into the family's history & tries to connect the dots, he recruits the help of Lisbeth Salander; a young computer hacker who has dark secrets of her own.Ingeniously directed by David Fincher, the first impression is made in the opening moments only for the title sequence is a work of marvellous creativity, which puts the viewers in just the right mood for the dark journey that lies ahead. Screenplay is penned down by Steven Zaillian, who does a good job in providing a cohesive structure to the whole plot, keeps it faithful enough to its source material & also handles the characterization part pretty well.Coming to the technical aspects, Fincher's version of the first chapter in the Millennium Trilogy is far superior to its Swedish counterpart in every manner. Set pieces are painstakingly detailed, Cinematography makes precise use of colour tones, camera-work, detailing & lighting, Editing is smoothly carried out, and the unsettling score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Rose perfectly captures the ominous ambiance of the story with its eerie tracks.As far as performances go, the film features a reliable cast in Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Stellan Skarsgård, Christopher Plummer & others, with Craig & Mara impressing the most. Craig never lets his James Bond persona affect his performance here & is very convincing as Blomkvist while Mara is a revelation in the coveted role of Lisbeth Salander, is easily the strongest character in the film & her on-screen chemistry with Craig is instantly likable.Compared to the Swedish film adaptation, I've to say that this one is slightly inferior in its overall impact. The violence in the original was far more emotionally affecting, and even Noomi Rapace was a better Lisbeth than Mara is, though by no means does it mean I didn't love the latter's performance. Where this remake triumphs is in providing a far better visual & sound design but it never really brings anything new in the storytelling department.On an overall scale, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo plays remarkably well to David Fincher's strengths & by every means is an English-language remake done right, despite the few nitpicks. The character of Lisbeth alone is enough to keep you invested into its dark story & the unflinching portrayal of its disturbing themes also works out in its favour. Definitely worth a shot, this fascinating meditation on evil comes highly recommended.",Null,2,6,8 October 2013
Rocky IV," Definitely More Enjoyable & Entertaining Than Rocky II & Rocky III
","The most commercially successful film in Rocky franchise that utilises the tension between US & USSR to its advantage, there is no denying that Rocky IV brims with a strong dose of patriotism from start to finish but apart from that and a truly intimidating antagonist, there is nothing impressive about it for the story is only as good as the previous two chapters.The fourth instalment in the Rocky series, Rocky IV continues the journey of Rocky Balboa as the reigning world heavyweight champion challenges a virtually invincible opponent from the Soviet Union for a match in Moscow in order to avenge the death of Apollo Creed, who was mercilessly beaten to death by the Russian in an exhibition match, and to also defend the honour of his country.Written & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky IV continues to milk the franchise for all its worth but it does manage to offer a few interesting moments over the course of its runtime. The shortcomings that were evident in the direction & writing aspects of Rocky II & Rocky III continue here as well, the action segments range from impressive to absurd, and the drama is once again a weak element.The technical aspects are more refined, Bill Conti's absence from the music department is felt at times, and watching Apollo Creed getting beaten to a pulp after such an exaggerated entrance of his is no doubt hilarious as hell. The reprising cast has been in stealth mode since the first movie and nothing much changes here. Dolph Lundgren however does well with what he's given and makes his character of Ivan Drago truly frightening to an extent.On an overall scale, Rocky IV is definitely more enjoyable, entertaining & rewarding than the previous two entries and the final fight also manages to live up to its hype to finish the story on a rousing high but the inconsistency in its storytelling department and shallow work from its cast never really allow this sequel to lift from the ground and even with more budget & bigger ambitions, it fails to emulate the overall success of the original. Nevertheless, Rocky IV is worth a shot.",Null,0,0,24 September 2015
In the Name of the Father," Jim Sheridan's Finest Feature. One of Daniel Day-Lewis' Finest Performances.
","Based on the true events surrounding the IRA bombing of 1974 in England, In the Name of the Father tells the story of Gerry Conlon; a small time thief who, along with his friends, is falsely accused of committing the heinous crime & after being coerced into confessing guilty by the British police during the brutal interrogation is sentenced to prison life along with his father who is also implicated in the crime during the trial. The story covers 15 years of Conlon's wrongful imprisonment during which he tries to prove his innocence with the help of a British attorney.This is the 2nd collaboration between Jim Sheridan & Daniel Day-Lewis after My Left Foot and presents Sheridan in complete control of his craftsmanship & Day-Lewis at the top of his game. The real-life character of Gerry Conlon is magnificently brought to life by Day-Lewis & he was simply at his best during the interrogation scene, making it the film's most intense sequence. Also, the scenes between Gerry & his father, played amazingly well by Pete Postlethwaite, are its finest moments and the two shared an amazing chemistry together.On an overall scale, In the Name of the Father is one of those films that leaves little to complain about and is a brilliantly directed, deftly written, tightly edited, strongly performed & elegantly composed cinema that also features best works in the directional career of Jim Sheridan & acting career of Pete Postlethwaite. Daniel Day-Lewis' contribution here often gets overlooked but, in my opinion, it's right there amongst his finest performances. All in all, In the Name of the Father is one of the best films of its year and is a must watch for anyone who appreciates great cinema. Strongly recommended.",Null,0,0,11 October 2013
Being John Malkovich," A Seamless Fusion of Fantasy In A Real World Environment.
","Exciting, intriguing & incredibly original, Being John Malkovich is a seamless fusion of fantasy in a real world environment and presents an interesting theory of a portal that leads into the body of a different person. The screenplay is freshly imagined & smartly scripted by Charlie Kaufman and is stunningly presented on the screen by director Spike Jonze. The point of view shots are nicely carried out, editing never lets the excitement run out for the entire runtime & the performances by everyone is pretty much up to the mark.John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz; an unsuccessful puppeteer who discovers the portal into John Malkovich's mind, Cameron Diaz is Lotte Shwartz; Craig's pet-obsessed wife & finally we have Katherine Keener as Maxine; Craig's co-worker who decides to exploit the portal in order to make some bucks. John Malkovich plays himself in this film & his performance among the cast was the bravest & most impressive. The film also includes cameos from Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn & others playing a fictional version of themselves.On an overall scale, Spike Jonze's directional debut feature is one of those films which you mustn't miss out. You have to really see it to believe how amazing its concept is & how much sense its themes make in the real world atmosphere. The less you know about it, the better will be the experience. So, stop reading more about this film & just go watch it if you still haven't. In a sentence, Being John Malkovich is one of the finest films of the 90s.",Null,1,1,30 January 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Another Strong Entry In The Mission: Impossible Series!
","Out of all the franchises that are circulating in Hollywood at present, Mission: Impossible series is possibly the only one that refuses to conform to the norm and continues to defy the weariness that sets in once a few sequels of any franchise are out in the market. While the first two chapters were inherently weak, the third instalment provided the necessary boost to this series and that momentum carried on to the fourth one, which in my opinion is the most balanced entry in this saga, thus far.And now, we have a new one. Using the rogue agent formula of Mission: Impossible as the basis of its plot, lifting a key action segment from Mission: Impossible II & enhancing it to deliver a smashing sequence, incorporating the relentless energy of Mission: Impossible III, and aiming for the near-perfect balance of Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation is a tour-de-force of blockbuster filmmaking that's refreshing, riveting & entertaining from start to finish and is impressive enough to rank amongst the finest films of the year, so far.Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation finds IMF agent Ethan Hunt looking for intel to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a counter organisation to the IMF that has managed to stay invisible while carrying out its sinister duties. But when the CIA chief convinces the Senate to disband IMF & declares Hunt a fugitive who's to be apprehended on sight, Hunt decides to continue with his current investigation and secretly enlists the help of his former team & comes across a mysterious woman, who happens to have an agenda of her own.Written & directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the movie opens with an instantly captivating sequence, following which the main plot is set up relatively quick & the relevant characters are smartly introduced. McQuarrie expertly paces the whole narrative from the start and his screenplay is brilliantly penned down too for the story presents a tightly packed structure & nicely blends a sufficient dose of well-timed humour into its action-adventure premise. The kinetic direction & focused script does help but what improves its look n feel is its superbly executed technical aspects.Production design team does a stellar job in putting up the rich, refined set pieces that add a sumptuous feel to its peripheral surroundings & exotic locations. The fluid movements & clever placements of its camera, in addition to its radiant colour palette & effectual lighting, give its images a vibrant look that makes it come alive in splendid detail. Editing is tight & rarely allows the film to switch to a lower gear during its 131 minutes runtime. Furthermore, the entire experience is elevated by Joe Kraemer's explosive soundtrack which maintains a close proximity with the franchise's main theme at all times.Coming to the performances, Tom Cruise leads from the front in another turn as the famous IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and even though his performance is just as nuanced as before, his devotion to his most popular role is absolute. Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner & Simon Pegg return in their respective roles of Luther, Brandt & Benji and it's good to see that Pegg isn't in it just for the sake of providing the comic relief. The new additions include Sean Harris, Alec Baldwin & Rebecca Ferguson, amongst which Ferguson completely steals the show, delivers the strongest performance of the ensemble & her chemistry with Cruise just clicks.On an overall scale, building on the strength of its predecessors while also keeping a close eye on their shortcomings, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation packs in enough surprise, thrills & breakneck action to satisfy its audience, features some outstanding stunt work that makes its action all the more memorable, and emanates ample freshness throughout its runtime to succeed as a quality action extravaganza that's thoroughly satisfying. Definitely a worthy addition to the Mission: Impossible series, a fascinating example of blockbuster filmmaking, and a downright magnificent cinematic ride that's worth your time & money, Rogue Nation comes highly recommended.",Null,1,3,4 November 2015
Spider-Man," Sam Raimi Casts His Web And It Sticks Tight, Even After All These Years!
","One of the first movies to pave the groundwork for modern superhero flicks, Spider-Man is an incredibly fun & endlessly entertaining action-adventure that brings its web-slinging hero to life on the silver screen in a truly fascinating manner after spending nearly a quarter of a century in development hell and, with its record-breaking box office performance, acts as a precursor to an era when superheroes would dominate the summer box-office.Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the story of Spider-Man follows Peter Parker; a high-school kid who after being bitten by a radioactive spider at a genetic laboratory begins to develop spider-like abilities and puts his new powers to good use by turning to crimefighting. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn experiments a power-enhancing drug on himself as a desperate attempt to preserve a military contract critical for his company's survival.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man has all the ingredients of a summer blockbuster plus it benefits a lot from Raimi's dynamic filmmaking style that doesn't dwell on a single moment for far too long, keeps the story fresh, light-hearted & action-packed for the most part, plus never loses its initially-gained momentum. David Koepp's screenplay is no slouch either for it packs in a compelling plot & few interesting characters and the whole story is splendidly humoured.The technical aspects are all brilliantly executed. Camera-work is excellent for the most part for the chosen angles, swift movements, slow-mo shots & warm colour palette are correctly employed. Editing provides a frenetic pace to its narrative, each moment has a role to play, and its 121 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Visual effects team makes use of both CGI & practical stuntwork and it's amazing just how well it has dated when compared to other effects-laden movies released back then.Coming to the performances, Spider-Man packs in a very interesting cast in Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, J.K. Simmons & others, and many of them are pretty convincing in their given roles. Maguire does a terrific job under Raimi's supervision, Dafoe plays Norman Osborn with finesse but that Green Goblin suit is extremely off-putting, Simmons is a near-perfect rendition of J. Jonah Jameson from the comics while both Dunst & Franco do a fine job as Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborn, respectively.Also worthy of admiration is Danny Elfman's outstanding score that captures just the right tone & feel of your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's universe and brims with tracks that seamlessly integrate into the story. On an overall scale, Spider-Man may not seem as impressive today as it did back when it made its debut on the silver screen but it still remains one of the best offerings of its category and delivers a roller-coasted ride that's enjoyable, entertaining & highly satisfying. Far better than its decade later reboot, Spider-Man is summer popcorn extravaganza right on the money.",Null,1,3,9 September 2015

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Something Wicked This Way Comes
","It's absolutely amazing to find out what all can happen when you put a promising story that's full of imaginations, wonders & endless possibilities into the hands of a master storyteller and watch him/her elevate it to a whole new level. Breaking from the monotony of the previous 2 chapters, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first time we get a genuine taste of how magical, enchanting & mystifying the world of Harry Potter really is and the film as a whole is, in my opinion, the best installment of the Harry Potter franchise.Based on J.K. Rowling's 3rd novel & covering Potter's adventure during his 3rd year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban is a fresh overhaul & re- evaluation of every single thing that we've seen in the series, so far, and the changes are apparent in the smallest of details this time. And now for the plot summary, Harry Potter is in danger yet again as the convicted murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban (Wizard's prison) & is coming after Harry with all he's got.Chris Columbus directed the first 2 chapters of the franchise & even though his adaptations followed the respective novels pretty closely, there is no denying that both films felt somewhat dull, boring & flavourless along with low repeat value. For this film, Alfonso Cuarón takes the director's helm and succeeds immensely in providing a refreshing outlook to the whole film with quality narration & expert execution of its technical aspects. The film deviates from the novel by a great deal but it all eventually ends up working in the film's favour.Coming to the technical aspects, its vivid cinematography is absolutely dazzling for it adds a magical vibe to the entire film & makes terrific use of colour palette. Even something as small as transition from one scene to another or the sound made by the wand when a spell is cast ends up adding flavours of its own to the whole film & enriches the cinematic experience. Thanks to its tight editing, not a single scene feels irrelevant to the plot & even costumes get to play a major role this time.Also, this is the final time we have John Williams composing for a Harry Potter film and although the signature theme of the franchise stays in tact, the rest of the film's score is brought from the ground up to go with its much revamped look. And from start to finish, Williams' soundtrack here provides a sense of warmth & feelings of various emotions that flows in harmony from one scene to the next. And just like the film, the soundtrack of Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban is the finest in the series & also ranks as one of Williams' finest compositions.Coming to the performances, the young cast has matured greatly & one can see that in the excellent performances each one of them delivers this time. Amongst the recurring cast, Alan Rickman as Snape once again steals the show but the improvement in the performances of Radcliffe, Grint, Watson & Felton is worth mentioning. Michael Gambon takes over the role of Dumbledore from Richard Harris & chips in with an energetic performance. As for the new additions, it's Gary Oldman & David Thewlis who shine in their roles of Sirius Black & Prof. Lupin, respectively.On an overall scale, Alfonso Cuarón's Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban does everything right from start to finish. It manages to find the right balance between its drama, adventure & action elements and takes a remarkably fresh approach in adapting the novel on the film canvas. Brilliantly directed, cleverly narrated, deftly scripted, nicely performed, exquisitely photographed, elegantly edited & wonderfully scored, this wicked adventure is arguably the best chapter of its series, one of the best films of its year & one of the finest works of its genre as well. Delightfully recommended.",Null,0,1,17 July 2014
Ratatouille," My Personal Favourite Pixar Film
","Envisioned, cooked, garnished & served by the finest talents working at Pixar Animation Studios, Ratatouille is a magical blend of imagination, creativity & craftsmanship that puts together its fresh ingredients with remarkable care & attention to detail, is flavoured with fine dose of wit & huge shot of inspiration which is then baked to near-perfection under its impeccable direction, deftly written screenplay & incredible set of rich characters, followed by its garnishing with state-of-the-art animation, expert use of colour palettes & enchanting score, and is finally presented to us customers in a perfectly refined fashion.Set in the locales of Paris, the story of Ratatouille concerns Remy; an ambitious rat who is gifted with a highly developed sense of taste n smell, is skilled in the art of cooking & wants to become a great chef one day. While his rodent appearance & human's aversion to rats already pose a fatal threat to his passion for cooking, new doors of possibilities are opened when a fateful event separates Remy from his family & takes him to the famous restaurant of his culinary hero where he tries to achieve his goal by forming an odd alliance with the restaurant's garbage boy which turns the culinary world upside down.Written, produced & directed by Brad Bird, Ratatouille marks yet another achievement for Pixar as this revolutionary studio continues to scale new heights with its flawless fusion of quality storytelling with breathtaking animation and of all the films they've dished out so far, this is my personal favourite. The precision with which each frame is rendered here speaks volumes about the extensive research that went into its production and whether it is the depiction of Parisian streets or French cuisines or culinary art or rodent lifestyle or passion n love for food, Ratatouille captures these tiniest of details with sublime delicacy.The 3D animation from Pixar has always been at the forefront of its genre & with this film, it further pushes that art form into new realms to raise the bar once again. The biggest proof that Pixar absolutely nailed it when it comes to capturing the essence of food & culinary art is present in the moments when we find ourselves salivating for what actually are animated cuisines. Add to that, the characters inhabiting this picture are very life-like & well-rounded with defined arcs plus its storyline risks failure by taking the road-less-travelled but once again manages to come out a winner in the end, just like every single Pixar film before it.While characters in almost all their films are brilliantly designed, wonderfully detailed & smoothly rendered on the screen, there is one more thing that plays a vital role behind its success but never really gets enough credit & that's the contribution of its voice-cast. Time n again, Pixar has come up with a fitting cast to voice its characters & with Ratatouille, the tradition continues for the French accent here is pretty much spot-on. And last but not the least, there's Michael Giacchino's beautiful, heartwarming & delightful score that turns this tale into an emotional roller-coaster ride with its wild, dynamic & adventurous tracks.On an overall scale, Ratatouille is a mouth-watering blend of action, adventure, ambition, art & awesomeness that continues Pixar's unbroken winning streak by hitting an eighth consecutive home-run for the studio and, with the help of its terrific direction, inventive screenplay, dazzling visuals, gorgeous animation, awe-inspiring camera-work, tight editing, exquisite use of humour & mesmerising score, effortlessly succeeds as one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & fulfilling films ever made. Inspiring, motivating & satiating on both visceral & emotional scale plus radiating its heartfelt warmth effectively from start to finish, this culinary classic is a finger-lickin' delicious cuisine that comes delightfully recommended.",Null,1,2,7 October 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man Isn't Amazing At All.
","When Sony Pictures decided to reboot the Spider-Man franchise, I wondered if there really was a need for it considering that not much time had passed since Spider-Man 3 came out & overall, this franchise hadn't fared as worse as others to justify a reboot. Anyway, The Amazing Spider-Man tries to bring on screen the story of our friendly neighbourhood from its origins. Everyone must already be aware of the premise but in case you're not, it tells the story of Peter Parker & how he became Spider-Man in addition to an ugly, stupid villain thrown in here who is more funny (unintentionally, obviously) than scary. Director Marc Webb tries very hard to take his movie away from Sam Raimi's versions but it ends up with too many similarities in events, much less charm or excitement & is a dumbed down version of the original Spider-Man movie in a new package. Plus, the romantic arc between Peter Parker & Gwen Stacy is just absurd & eye-rollingly cheesy. Cinematography is more oriented to point-of-view shots while editing is just horrible. Visual effects feel incomplete & the music by James Horner is simply no match to Danny Elfman's magnificent score that actually feels like belonging to Spider-Man.Coming to the performances, Andrew Garfield is very much believable in the costume of Spider-Man & does a brilliant job in portraying the recklessness of a teenager in possession of newly discovered superpowers. Emma Stone is a darling as Gwen Stacy but she isn't given much to play with yet manages to tag along with a fine performance. Rest of the cast is simply forgettable. Also, Irrfan Khan's 'pivotal role' was; to be used as the poster boy for the film's marketing in India, which actually paid off as this movie had a record-breaking opening here.Now those who are still reading this review & are unfortunately fans of this film, few of them might argue that I should not compare this film with the original Spider-Man but if that's the case then what exactly was the point of making this film if it never was going to be better than its decade old version anyway? On an overall scale, adding nothing but only a new dimension (3D) which had its little moments, The Amazing Spider-Man isn't amazing at all & is just no match to Raimi's versions, which are more fun even today. In short, a needless reboot whose needless sequel is coming soon. Good luck, Sony Pictures.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,3,6,11 October 2013
The Lego Movie," The LEGO Movie Review
","Based on the famous Lego line of construction toys generations have grown up playing with, The Lego Movie tells the story of an ordinary Lego mini-figure who is a nobody but is mistaken as 'the Special' when he accidentally discovers the Piece of Resistance & is drafted into a fellowship of strangers with whom he takes an epic journey to stop an evil tyrant from gluing the entire Lego universe together.Written & directed by Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, the film is masterfully envisioned, excellently written, carefully crafted & is infused with heavy use of pop-culture references from start to finish. The animation is wonderful, cinematography provides a vibrant look to the Lego universe, the entire film is terrifically paced, the humour is perfectly timed & the background score makes it even more awesome.Coming to voice performances, The Lego Movie employs a pretty impressive voice cast in Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman & others with each one of them donning the roles of equally fascinating characters amongst which my favourite turned out to be Batman, voiced by Will Arnett. And every single frame in the film pays homage to cinema classics & delivers them in rapid-fire succession.On an overall scale, The Lego Movie is a thoughtfully structured, hilariously narrated & intelligently executed work of originality, fun & creativity that's exuberantly directed, deftly written, gorgeously animated, fiercely paced, splendidly photographed, superbly voiced, nicely scored & is jam-packed with never-ending funny lines plus pop-cultural references throughout its runtime.

Aliens," One Of The Greatest Action, Science-Fiction & Horror Films Of All Time.
","There are very few sequels in cinema that manage to surpass the originals and overcome the expectations of the first chapter's loyal & faithful fans. And James Cameron's Aliens manages to do exactly that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to as this second chapter is way more bigger & action-packed than its predecessor and succeeds not just as a great sci-fi horror but redefines the action genre as well.A wildly entertaining, immensely satisfying & one spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action that refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films ever made, James Cameron's Aliens is arguably the best film of the franchise, certainly one of the greatest sequels of all time and one of the finest & most influential examples of its genre(s). A perfect follow-up to Alien that, just like its predecessor, is immortal for its contribution to cinema.",Null,1,2,2 September 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Live And Let Live.
","Bolstered by career-best performance from Matthew McConaughey & another swashbuckling role by the ever adaptable Jared Leto, Dallas Buyers Club tells the true life story of Ron Woodroof, an electrician & rodeo who, when diagnosed with the HIV virus & predicted to die within a month, starts smuggling unapproved medicine into the country to help other AIDS patients when he finds the drug's effectiveness in improving his symptoms. The film also covers his battle with FDA over the corruption that exists within the organization that was built for the betterment of suffering people.Smartly directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, well-researched, nicely scripted, steadily edited & covering the country ambiance pretty well, the best part about Dallas Buyers Club is its performances. Matthew McConaughey gives an spectacular but intricately layered performance as the homophobic Ron Woodroof and embodied the right physicality & personality to play the character. Jared Leto is one of those immensely versatile actors whom you can give any role & they'll end up completely getting into the skin of it. And that's what Leto does here while playing an HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon, with whom Ron makes a business deal as she can bring him clients for the medicine, and gives a performance that easily goes down as one of this year's strongest. Jennifer Garner was alright as she didn't have much to do here anyway.On an overall scale, Dallas Buyers Club is a pretty good, if not great, motion picture that is greatly helped by the performances of McConaughey & Leto to be worth of your time & money. It might be disturbing to watch at times for some viewers but in an emotionally captivating manner, it shows the plight of people who know they'll be dying very soon but are still daring to live by trying whatever means possible. One never really learns the true value of his/her life until it's too late for them to get it back & that's what this film is trying to reflect to some extent while also making a powerful statement about the the injustice & abandonment a person suffering from AIDS still faces around the world. Give it a try.",Null,1,2,15 January 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Slightly Dated But Still Enormously Fun.
","A surprise hit of its year whose unexpected success spawned a franchise that continues to churn out sequels even to this date, The Fast and the Furious is the sole reason why both Vin Diesel & Paul Walker are a household name today and even if it seems a bit dated now, it's still capable of delivering a cinematic ride that's thrilling & fun for the most part.The story of The Fast and the Furious is set in Los Angeles and follows an undercover cop who's assigned to find the gang responsible for stealing expensive electronic equipments, and uses his cover to infiltrate into this world of illegal street racing but soon begins having doubts about where his loyalties lie as he becomes increasingly enamoured by this lifestyle.A finely directed film, the dialogues of which may sound a bit corny now, one of the reasons why this street-racing thriller works is because of the testosterone high it provides with the high-speed racing & chase sequences it packs in, which wasn't an everyday phenomena in movies back in those days, in addition to the plethora of style it oozes from the first frame to the last.On an overall scale, The Fast and the Furious is an exciting blend of an interesting storyline, kinetic direction, energetic camera-work, fabulously edited chase sequences & top-gear score that's fun, enjoyable & entertaining for the most part, while the committed performances by Diesel & Walker do provide the boost it required to propel itself beyond mediocrity.

The Exorcist," The Scariest Film Of All Time? In A Way, Yes!
","For the sheer magnitude of unrelenting terror that The Exorcist unleashed on its unsuspecting audience during its theatrical run back in 1973, the tag of 'the scariest film of all time' sits perfectly well on this horror masterpiece. After all, there has never been an example in motion picture history which has affected the viewers as strongly as this film did for many fainted, threw up or went hysteric in a manner unlike anything witnessed before or after it.Looking back now, countless imitations & parodies over the years might have diminished its scare factor by a great deal but there's no denying that even today The Exorcist remains in a league of its own & is yet to find an equal. Succeeding not just as a genre-defining tale of demonic possession but also as a remarkable piece of superb storytelling with great character build-up & groundbreaking special effects, The Exorcist is very possibly the gold standard of horror filmmaking.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Exorcist takes place in the Georgetown area of Washington D.C. & concerns the 12-year old daughter of a famous actress, who begins manifesting some strangely disturbing behavioural changes in her personality. When science fails to offer any rational explanation, her mother turns to superstition in a desperate attempt to save her daughter's life & enlists the help of a troubled priest, who is struggling with his own faith.Directed by William Friedkin, the film opens with one of the most powerful, sinister & perfectly crafted prologues which apart from serving as a warning for things to come also sets up an extremely eerie mood for the rest of the film. Friedkin's work here is perhaps the finest of his career as the extent to which the director went in order to bring out the best from his cast & crew is well documented plus he left no stone unturned to make the experience as emotionally shattering as possible.The screenplay is penned down by William Peter Blatty, the author of the novel, and it is expertly balanced in all storytelling aspects. Cinematography makes brilliant use of slow zooms, panning, close-ups & sharp focus to immerse viewers into its demonic tale, use of music is effectively carried out, make-up & special effects end up adding a whole new chapter to filmmaking manuals and as far as editing goes, it paces the film ingeniously but is also marred by heavy amount of continuity errors.Coming to the performances, The Exorcist features a talented cast in Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow & Lee J. Cobb. One amazing thing here is that the characters are wonderfully fleshed out in the script & the actors simply build their act on an already solid platform, delivering some high quality performances. Each character is properly introduced, their arc is elegantly handled & unlike most horror films of today, we do grow to care for these fictional lives on the screen.What continues to separate The Exorcist from most examples of its genre is that despite its extensive gore effects & disturbing premise, the main emphasis remains on telling a story rather than revel in its extremity, which ultimately makes the final showdown all the more bone- chilling & unforgettable. The horror it unleashes is absolutely brutal, difficult to watch & too heavy in content yet the extent to which this film pushed the boundary of horror cinema by exploring subjects no one before ever dared to venture in is no mere feat in itself.On an overall scale, The Exorcist is one of the most influential, unnerving & faith-shattering films ever made which opened the doors to our deepest fears back when it was released and is still capable of surprising the newcomers with its discomforting ambiance & themes, if not the now dated visceral horror. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, memorable for the mass hysteria it caused, and admirable for its uncompromising & undeniably effective take on demonic possession, 'the scariest film of all time' comes strongly recommended.",Null,2,3,21 October 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Lives Up To Its Hype & Delivers Everything It Promised.
","What has always set X-Men apart from other superhero-themed movies is that the conflicts present between mutants & humans in their stories very much reflect the predicaments most minority groups like LGBT community to anyone who doesn't fit in society's description of 'normal' continue to find themselves in on a daily basis in real life.After the critical & commercial success of X-Men: First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past makes it way into cinema amid enormous hype but the great news is that it manages to live up to everything it promises. Days of Future Past connects the characters from the original X-Men Trilogy with their younger selves from X-Men: First Class in an epic battle where they need to change the past to save their future.Ingeniously directed by Bryan Singer who returns to the X-Men franchise after being absent from it for over a decade yet he shows no loss in form whatsoever & ends up crafting his finest X-Men film with this instalment. And not only does he brilliantly continue the story introduced in X- Men: First Class but also brings the original X-Men Trilogy to a magnificent conclusion in this tale.The screenplay is a gem in itself & thanks to Singer's excellent direction, the complex story isn't very difficult to follow, despite the plethora of characters present in it. Production design is no short of impressive, cinematography captures the two timelines in fine detailing, pacing is absolutely relentless as there isn't a single dull moment in the film, visual effects is seamlessly integrated & John Ottman's music adds a flavour of its own to the finished product.Coming to the acting department, Days of Future Past features an ensemble cast in Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, Halle Berry, Evan Peters, Peter Dinklage, Ellen Page & others. And although each one of them has done a fab job in their given roles, it's actually Evan Peters who ends up stealing the show in his brief appearance as Quicksilver.On an overall scale, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the most ambitious X-Men film to date & although the stakes are high this time, it manages to work both as an explosive sequel to X- Men: First Class & a highly satisfying conclusion to the previous X-Men films. Featuring upgrades in all departments of filmmaking, this latest instalment is one of the most action- packed, relentlessly paced, emotionally gripping & rewarding sequels of its genre and comes highly recommended.P.S. Don't go for it unless you've seen at least the original X-Men Trilogy & X-Men: First Class. And don't miss its after-credits scene which offers a sneak-peek at the next chapter, X-Men: Apocalypse, scheduled for release in Summer 2016.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,31 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," An Expertly Balanced, Inherently Focused & Emotionally Dense Summer Extravaganza
","The Phase 3 of Marvel Studios' shared universe is off to a rousing start as the 13th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is another outstanding example of blockbuster filmmaking that, despite being stuffed with too many characters, is able to provide them their fair share of screen time but what's more impressive is that it does so without taking the centerstage away from its eponymous character, thus succeeding as a Captain America sequel rather than coming off as Avengers 2.5.Set one year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War follows Steve Rogers whose latest mission to prevent few mercenaries from stealing a biological weapon results in inadvertent deaths of few civilians, following which the UN introduces measures to keep the Avengers in check. With some in favour of the Accords while others against it, the group is split into two opposing factions, one led by Rogers & the other headed by Tony Stark. Meanwhile, a new villain emerges to exploit a weak spot within the Avengers.Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, Civil War finds the duo filmmakers in splendid form as they successfully juggle with the arcs of reprising & new characters without deviating too far from the main premise. By capitalising on the plus points of their previous venture, the Russos make sure that the focus remains on Steve Rogers & his journey while other characters weave in-n-out of his story. The swift pacing & uniform flow is effectively maintained, plus all the heavy emotions that come into play in the final showdown feel genuinely earned.The screenplay is no slouch either, for the writers move the plot forward by betting more on the emotions than its big-budget spectacle. Unlike previous entries, the collateral damage incurred in the Avengers' presence is consistently questioned and there is valid reasoning behind all the choices these characters make. The disagreement between Rogers & Stark over international oversight stems from their own experiences as the former's faith is shattered after witnessing the corruption in The Winter Soldier while the latter is willing to submit after the destruction his actions caused in Age of Ultron.Captain America: Civil War doesn't sway away from the established Marvel formula. Instead it distills out the impurities by stepping back from the reckless destruction of buildings & cities, and chooses to introspect its characters & their actions on a deeper level while addressing a few serious themes simultaneously. But its effervescent wit is never lost in the process and is consistent in delivery & timing. However, apart from its top-tier editing, the technical aspects don't improve by much and retain the iconography of its predecessors.Coming to the performances, Civil War features a marvellous ensemble in Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, William Hurt, Daniel Brühl & others. Evans remains the lead despite sharing space with so many people and his performance is very measured. With welcome depth added to Tony Stark's arc, Downey Jr. chips in with an emotionally hefty work without discarding his innate charm & magnetic screen presence. And with her allegiance torn between the two factions, Johansson explores her character's spot quite ably.Boseman as Black Panther truly nails his part, stealing the limelight from even the big players on more occasions than one. Stan does a brilliant job in maintaining the dual nature of his character's persona. Brühl's character silently develops in the background and the rationale behind his sinister plan is believable. But the most memorable turn comes from the web-slinging, friendly neighbourhood known as Spider-Man. Appearing in costume in just one sequence, Holland leaves a lasting impression with an energetic performance that brims with vibrancy, excitement & just the right amount of cockiness.On an overall scale, Captain America: Civil War is one of the strongest films to come out from Marvel Studios' canon. By neatly balancing more than a dozen characters in its 2½ hours runtime, the confident direction by the Russos comes as a respite & assurance that the fate of Avengers: Infinity War is in good hands.. The latest offering in the MCU is no gamechanger but it is the finest implementation of the steps the studio follows to create its recipes, and benefits greatly from its deftly written script. A thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying extravaganza for the masses, Captain America: Civil War is the summer blockbuster to beat this year.",Null,1,8,25 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Pointless, Superfluous & Unwarranted, Fantastic Beasts Is Anything But Fantastic
","The breathtaking mythology of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world was brought to silver screen through the collective wizardry of an epic ensemble that dazzled the hearts & minds of muggles around the world and it still remains one of the most beloved film franchises of all time. But we are living in an age where no series is ever allowed to rest in peace, and so this magical world is back again, with a spin-off that doesn't have an ounce of the original's magic.An absolutely pointless, superfluous & unwarranted return to the wizarding world, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a dull, needless & wholly redundant spin-off that nobody ever asked for and is even worse than the weakest Harry Potter film. Lacking an interesting set of characters, far too preoccupied with its beasts, and devoid of everything that made its predecessor so delightfully captivating, this subsidiary of a much superior franchise isn't worth a dime.A spin-off of the Harry Potter film series, the story of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them follows the adventures of Newt Scamander, an eccentric & introverted wizard who arrives in New York with a suitcase full of diverse, magical creatures but finds himself being chased by American wizarding authorities after his suitcase mix-up with a muggle results in several creatures escaping out in the city, thus threatening the exposure of the magical world.Directed by David Yates, there is an attempt to create its organic world from scratch but it indulges in so many trivial moments and moves at such tiresome pace that the interest fizzles out real soon. Yates' direction is substandard but the fault mainly lies with the script. Written by J.K. Rowling, the film brings its magical creatures to life in fine detail but the human characters lack sturdy arcs and have nothing to make the audience invest in their journey.Production design team does well to recreate the 1920s New York setting, and its set pieces are sumptuously decorated. Cinematography employs colour tones that impart a slightly vintage vibe to its images. The use of CGI is excessive yet the very segments they are applied to remain hollow from within. Editing is poorly carried out, for its 133 minutes runtime is severely felt plus it fails to keep the interest alive. And lastly, James Newton Howard's score is only mildly effective.The film packs a capable cast in Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller & others yet nobody leaves a lasting impression. Redmayne comes off as too eccentric in the role of Newt Scamander, Fogler plays an oafish muggle, Waterston's character isn't remotely interesting, Sudol is an overdose of sugarcoated mediocrity, Farrell at least tries to make his character stand out, while Miller contributes well with what he's given.On an overall scale, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is arguably the worst thing to come out of J.K. Rowling's imagination and is as lifeless in storytelling as it is bland in characterisation. Failing to bring anything new to the table, it is a tediously crafted, awfully written & shoddily narrated fantasy that's overlong, uninspiring & frustrating, and is lacking in originality & creativity. In short, the new era of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world is off to a highly disappointing & instantly forgettable start, and is anything but fantastic.",Null,2,6,1 March 2017
Gandhi," A Masterwork Of Astounding Production, Both In Scope & Ambition!
","Winner of 8 Academy Awards including best picture, Gandhi is a masterwork of astounding production, both in scope & ambition, that brings on screen the extraordinary life story of its titular character whose non-violent, non-cooperative protests sparked a revolution that eventually brought India its independence from British rule, and has continued to influence various leaders & political movements around the world ever since.Bookended by his assassination & subsequent funeral in 1948, the story of Gandhi begins in South Africa in 1893 where, after being thrown off the train for being a person of colour, Mohandas K Gandhi initiates a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in the country and eventually secures a victory. The plot then covers his journey in India where he launches an unprecedented movement that inspires millions of citizens to join the fight for India's independence from British Empire.Produced & directed by Richard Attenborough, Gandhi is undoubtedly the finest work of his directional career for the story is extensively researched and is crafted with meticulous care & attention to detail plus its subject matter is treated with utmost respect. It's no doubt a very ambitious project but Attenborough manages to make it all work quite well, and while the picture isn't flawless by any means, it certainly does justice to its larger-than-life character who's brought to life through an equally transcending performance.Production design team deserves kudos for the set pieces & locations evoke an authentic feel of rural India. John Briley's script attempts to dig deeper into Gandhi's philosophy of life, many of which are interesting, plus the decision on what segment to include & what to leave out from the picture are wisely chosen. Camera-work is steadily carried out, its 191 minutes of runtime may seem daunting at first but it never bothers once the movie begins, and Ravi Shankar's score is firmly rooted in Indian heritage but it also ends up distracting on few occasions.Coming to the performances, Gandhi features a highly impressive cast filled with renowned character actors from both British & Indian film industry and if you pay close attention, you can also find Daniel Day-Lewis in here. However, the supporting performances are passable at best for those actors don't have much to contribute & make fine use of their limited screen time. But the best part about Gandhi is Ben Kingsley's outstanding performance in the title role and whether it's the looks, mannerisms, physical deterioration or humbleness, Kingsley absolutely nails it.On an overall scale, Gandhi is an epic biopic that paints a riveting portrait of an ordinary lawyer who stood up against crime, injustice & discrimination all his life and later became the preeminent leader of India's independence movement against the British rule. An essential cinema chronicling the life of one of the most prominent & inspiring figures to have ever lived, brought to life by Richard Attenborough in a very disciplined manner, and further elevated to a whole new level by Ben Kingsley's exceptional performance, Gandhi comes highly recommended to every film lover & history aficionado out there.",Null,1,1,15 August 2015
American History X," His Father Taught Him To Hate. His Friends Taught Him Rage. His Enemies Gave Him Hope.
","An excellent exemplification of provocative filmmaking, American History X is a brutally honest, hard-hitting, very unsettling, fiercely violent & absolutely devastating but crucial look at the destructive nature of racism & tells the story of a former neo-nazi skinhead who tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same wrong path that he did years ago.Direction & screenplay is mercilessly brutal & uncompromising, cinematography elegantly switches from present timeline to flashbacks, editing adds a smooth transition to its non-linear narration & music fits it perfectly but the most impressive contribution comes from the strong, blistering & career-best performances from Edward Norton & Edward Furlong.Beginning with a shocking opening sequence, remaining very intense throughout its runtime & culminating with an even more dreadful ending, American History X successfully completes its arc of racism & hate and, in a hard-hitting manner, accomplishes its goal of depicting the price one ultimately pays, sooner or later, for following the path of hatred.Powerful Cinema.

Saw III," Effective In Only Bits n Pieces Yet Suffices As A Serviceable Sequel
","Filmed on a bigger budget yet lacking the creativity that made the original click so well, the third instalment in the Saw series takes the usual elements of its predecessors and magnifies it by an extent but the end result is still the same old story as before and remains on par with the second entry.Saw III covers two story lines that merge in the end. The first concerns an anguished man who's put through a series of 'tests', each meant to bring him closer to the person responsible for the death of his son. The second follows Jigsaw who has his apprentice kidnap a doctor and instructs her to keep him alive for one final test.Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, Saw III is virtually the same stuff all over again and even though there is an attempt to bring an emotional dimension into the story, it doesn't really stick for long. It does crank up the voltage though when it comes to violence n gore and is more stomach-churning than its predecessors but that's expected.The flashbacks cover the backstories of Jigsaw & his apprentice as well as their time together but there are so many of them that it disrupts with the narrative flow and kills the tension more times than one. Performances stay on same level as before with Tobin Bell again doing a pretty neat job while the rest just chip in with fine supporting work.On an overall scale, Saw III features a plot that's more far-fetched than the last time but still packs enough brutality to satisfy those who especially came looking for it. The discrepancies caused by its constantly shifting focus & irregular pacing do result in a fractured narrative that's only effective in bits n pieces but in the end, it suffices as a serviceable sequel, if not a rewarding one.",Null,0,1,17 September 2016
Ocean's Eleven," Promises Loads Of Fun And Successfully Delivers It
","Smart, stylish & sophisticated, Ocean's Eleven is a sneaky delight that brims with a fun vibe & moves ahead with a carefree attitude, is jam-packed with colourful set of characters who are expertly brought to life by its charismatic cast, and is all the more strengthened by the smooth chemistry they share with each other.The story of Ocean's Eleven follows Danny Ocean who, the moment he is out of prison on parole, begins concocting his next robbery. Needing a team of skilled accomplices to carry out his highly ambitious mission, he enlists the help of an old friend and puts together a team of 11 accomplices, all of whom must work together to carry out the heist successfully.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise and keeps adding new characters without slowing down the plot. Soderbergh directs each segment with a playful tone and keeps the lighthearted nature of the story alive at all times. The writing is sleek, witty & energetic although the central core of the narrative isn't strong enough.Las Vegas is captured in all its glory, thanks to its exotic shooting locations, well-carved set pieces, vibrant photography, swift camera-work, bright lighting, trendy costumes & numerous aspects that only help in uplifting the film's opulent look n feel. Music also carries a groovy element although it isn't anything memorable.Coming to the performances, Ocean's Eleven features a charismatic ensemble in George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck & others, with both Clooney & Pitt impressing the most. Bringing his charming screen persona into play, Pitt delivers a show-stealing performance but Clooney isn't far behind plus the chemistry between these two is one of the film's main highlights.On an overall scale, Ocean's Eleven is an enjoyable, entertaining & sufficiently satisfying delight that promises lots of fun throughout its 117 minutes runtime and, for the most part, successfully delivers it. The lack of seriousness only takes it so far and while it's certainly missing the element that makes a good film great, Ocean's Eleven nevertheless manages to sideline its shortcomings with a thrilling climax that lives up to its expectations.",Null,1,1,8 September 2017
Spirited Away," Hayao Miyazaki's Magnum Opus? Possibly Yes!
","A marvel of originality, a standard of cinematic vision & a stunning work of art, Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away presents the master storyteller revelling at the prime of his filmmaking career by blending together all the ingredients of his previous works into one mystically magical adventure that'll have its viewers intrigued, transfixed & transported to a whole new different world from start to finish.Spirited Away is a coming-of-age drama, adventure, comedy, romance & fantasy, all merged into one, and concerns Chihiro; a 10-year old girl who, while moving to a new neighbourhood with her parents, gets stuck in the world of gods, witches & monsters. After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes up a job at the witch's bathhouse in order to free herself & her parents from the magic spell and return to the human world.After setting an animation benchmark with his remarkable epic i.e. Princess Mononoke, writer-director Hayao Miyazaki comes out of his self-imposed retirement to set another standard & delivers the most artistic work of his glorious career. The film is abundant with his trademarks, recurrent themes, allegories & fascinating characters yet it retains the innocence & childlike sense of wonder to eventually deliver a truly spellbinding experience.There isn't a single scene in the film that doesn't display the wonderful craftsmanship of the people working at Studio Ghibli, the themes of environmental pollution, greed & the passage to adulthood is carefully portrayed plus the 2D animation is simply astonishing. The plot is nicely structured & finely paced while the characters make the drama more compelling & are cleverly fleshed-out in the script. And Joe Hisaishi's score adds even more richness to an already amazing story.On an overall scale, Spirited Away is a masterpiece of bold, creative & fearless imagination that takes its genre to a whole new level and despite its complexity, it can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. Many hail this anime as Miyazaki's magnum opus & even though I don't share the same view, I can see why it's called so. One of Miyazaki's most ambitious features, one of Studio Ghibli's greatest accomplishments & one of world cinema's highly treasured gems, Spirited Away will take your breath away.

Jackie," An Enigmatic Rendition Of The Titular First Lady And An Interesting Portrait Of Loss, Grief, Trauma & Legacy
","Powered by an enigmatic performance from Natalie Portman, Jackie paints an interesting portrait of the former First Lady of the United States and is a skilfully envisioned biographical drama that's emotionally dense & involving at times but it is unfortunately marred by its filmmaker's inability to provide a proper structure & uniform flow to its storyline, thus resulting in a fragmented narrative.Jackie tells the story of Jacqueline Kennedy and covers the ordeal she goes through following the assassination of her husband & then US President, John F. Kennedy. The plot offers a rare glimpse into her well-guarded personality by focusing on events before & after the tragic incident, like her much publicised tour of the White House, JFK's funeral arrangements, and an attempt to establish her husband's legacy.Directed by Pablo Larraín, Jackie is his first English-language film and although he presents some neat ideas regarding what part to include & which direction to take the story in, he messes it all up by trying to juggle too many subplots at once, thus resulting in unexpected tonal shifts and jarring scenes. The script packs a solid premise but could've used more refinement in order to streamline the whole narrative flow.The technical department showcase an extensive amount of research in each n every aspect, for all its set pieces & costumes are in tune with the historical accounts plus the grainy camera-work & seamless integration of archived footages do bring an added authenticity to its depicted timeline. And last but not the least, the stinging score from Mica Levi is chilling at first but it turns repetitive after a while and doesn't leave much of an impact.Coming to the performances, Jackie features a reliable cast in Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup & John Hurt in what turned out to be his final role. Most impressive of them all is Portman who delivers a truly knockout performance in the role of the iconic First Lady and captures the different shades of her character with panache. The rest do well in their given roles but are easily eclipsed by Portman's stellar rendition.On an overall scale, Jackie had all the ingredients to finish as a thoroughly compelling biopic and works as a powerful vignette of loss, grief, trauma & legacy but all of it might have resonated more had it opted for a simpler plot line instead of jumping from flashbacks to present to flashforwards without any sense of direction. Admirable for its meticulous attention to period-specific details & saved by Natalie Portman's beautifully layered performance, Jackie is nevertheless worth a shot.",Null,1,2,25 February 2017
Duck You Sucker," The Final Western from the Auteur of Westerns.
","From the auteur of westerns, Duck, You Sucker! is the final western from director Sergio Leone & is rightfully claimed as the most overlooked film of his illustrious career. Serving only as a producer when the film went into production & later talked into directing it, this film turns out to be a quite good standalone example of its genre but pales in comparison to what Leone accomplished with his last 4 films.Set in Mexico at the time of revolution, it tells the story of Juan Miranda; a Mexican outlaw leading a bandit family, who meets an IRA explosives expert on the run named John & forces him into his scheme of robbing the Mesa Verde national bank, only to have tables turned around for him when he ends up freeing the rebel prisoners & is hailed by them as a glorious hero of the revolution, thus attracting unwanted attention from the army.Leone's direction isn't as memorable as his previous works & although it features some of his signature styles, it is often too exaggerated (one example being the extreme close-ups of people's mouth while they are eating & talking). Yet, the story is steadily narrated & only gets better as the film progresses. Cinematography presents a raw, conflicted look. Editing could've could've worked with few more trims. And lastly, it features one of Ennio Morricone's most playful compositions.The performances by Rod Steiger & James Coburn as Juah & John, respectively, is good & their chemistry together is even better. The revolution itself is brilliantly depicted whether it's by any means accurate or not, the effects look majestic in parts & the finale as well as the character's introductions are its finest moments. On an overall scale, Duck, You Sucker! may not score much when compared with Leone's earlier works but as a standalone feature, it is an impressive work of its genre that can really benefit from a wider audience.P.S. Also known as A Fistful of Dynamite and Once Upon a Time... the Revolution.",Null,1,2,7 April 2014
Tropic Thunder," Watch It For Robert Downey Jr. & The Almost Unrecognisable Tom Cruise!
","A rollicking romp-ride that parodies a number of war classics over the course of its runtime and also offers an inside look at Hollywood productions in its own amusing manner, Tropic Thunder is a fabulous blend of brilliant direction, skillful writing & charismatic performances that easily ranks amongst the finest comedies of the past decade.The story of Tropic Thunder follows a group of actors filming a Vietnam-war memoir on site where the production has already gone over budget & is behind schedule. Things are set in motion when the rookie director, who's unable to control his actors, decides to drop them in the middle of the jungle where the cast continues its act thinking that they are still shooting a movie.Co-written, produced & directed by Ben Stiller, Tropic Thunder introduces its characters in an incredibly fascinating manner for it begins with a brief ad, which is then followed by faux trailers that introduces each main character in their upcoming flicks, and after that the main feature presentation begins. And from that point onwards, it's simply an unabashedly funny ride to the very end.The film derives its parodic elements mainly from Platoon & Apocalypse Now and although it's hilarious as hell, it isn't just around for the comic effect only for it also moves the story forward. The dynamic camera-work injects its own energy into the swiftly unfolding storyline but there are still a couple of moments this film could've done without. But the real highlight is the contribution from its cast.Featuring a star-studded cast in Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., with additional inputs coming from Brandon T. Jackson, Jay Baruchel, Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Matthew McConaughey & Tom Cruise. Stiller is as good in front of the camera as he's behind it and plays the role of a fading celebrity pretty well while Black is very much in his comfort zone and does nicely as a drug-addicted comedian.Robert Downey Jr., however, is the best of them all and plays the role of a 5-time Academy Award winning, immensely talented, Australian method actor and his performance as a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude is definitely amongst his finest. The rest of the supporting cast is no slouch & do a good job in their given roles while Cruise simply steals every moment he's in & is quite unrecognisable as the ill-tempered, foul-mouthed studio executive.On an overall scale, Tropic Thunder is a stinging satire on Hollywood that promises loads of laughs over the course of its runtime, brims with creativity, passion & charisma for the most part, and is at its best when the screen is occupied by either Downey Jr. or Cruise. One of the genuinely impressive examples of its genre that's wildly enjoyable, mindlessly entertaining, ingeniously witty & sufficiently satisfying, Tropic Thunder comes delightfully recommended.",Null,0,1,12 October 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Funny, Fizzy & Freakish In All Ways Imaginable.
","Sprinting at such high velocity & packing so much dynamic energy that it feels like being hit by an express train, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World travels from its source to destination in just one gear: top. A highly charged & vividly animated roller-coaster ride, it is as exhausting as it is entertaining, as frustrating as it is amusing, and as nonsensical as it is high on adrenaline.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World tells the story of its titular character, a 20-something slacker musician who is yet to recover from his previous breakup, is dating a high-school student & falls in love with the new girl in town. Soon after, he learns that in order to date his latest crush, he will have to fight & defeat her seven evil exes, each seemingly more powerful than the other.Written & directed by Edgar Wright, the movie picks up speed almost as soon as it begins and then rides on this swiftly gained momentum for the remainder of its runtime. Wright unfolds the story as if swiftly skimming through a tale, and the only way to enjoy this ride is by allowing yourself to be swept by its tide. It's full of life, full of vigour & full of passion but it isn't a film for all.Set pieces are utilised in a way as if breathing life into comic book pages, the swift manoeuvring of camera & exuberant use of colours only ends up adding more vibrancy to its images. Music plays a key role in every segment and keeps things alive at all times. But there are also times when it ends up overdosing itself with too much oddity, plus not all its attempts at humour hit the right spot.Coming to the performances, the film packs a colourful cast, many of whom would later go on to make a name for themselves. The eponymous character is played by Michael Cera but he's easily overshadowed by others, namely Mary Elizabeth Winstead & Brie Larson who chip in way better as his future & ex girlfriend respectively. Best of all, however, is Kieran Culkin who play his roommate.On an overall scale, Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is funny, fizzy & freakish in all ways imaginable, and is guaranteed to garner a devoted fan following but its uncontrolled zest & sharp tonality may turn out to be either too much or too less for those who are looking for something bit more meaningful here. While I wasn't blown away by its quirky nature & zany wit, its wild, vigorous & ebullient delights cannot be downplayed.",Null,1,1,3 July 2017
The Usual Suspects," The Greatest Trick Bryan Singer Ever Pulled Was To Convince The World That This Film Is Just Another Thriller
","The greatest trick The Usual Suspects ever pulled was to convince its audience that it's just another crime thriller. For the majority of its runtime, it travels the same route many other examples of its genre have done before, narrates its complex plot in a manner that does enough to keep the viewers around until the end & within those final moments, delivers a masterstroke so profound that it changes everything that unfolded on the screen before.The story of The Usual Suspects is covered in flashbacks & is narrated by a small time conman who is one of the only two survivors from the boat explosion that killed 27 men. His recounting of the events during his interrogation by the FBI links back to the time when he & four other criminals were rounded up by the police after which they formed a group of their own. Things become interesting when the near-mythical criminal mastermind's name comes up.Fabulously directed by Bryan Singer, The Usual Suspects is his breakthrough feature for it instantly catapulted him into the Hollywood limelight & the way he managed to bring the outstandingly written script to life is laudable. Singer progresses the plot in a slow n steady manner which lets the tension build up naturally & also employs various twists n turns at regular intervals to keep the viewers guessing and he is wonderfully supported by its rich cast.However, the film lacks a refined presentation for the narrative sometimes feels convoluted while on other occasions, it's highly intriguing. Editing at times struggles with the pacing but for the most part, it's brilliantly carried out. Cinematography encapsulates the whole picture with a foreboding atmosphere along with a mysterious vibe while John Ottman's score further elevates those elements which in turn makes the experience all the more suspenseful.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite & others. And while everyone is good in their respective roles, Spacey manages to take his role further with remarkable simplicity whether it's his dialogue delivery, vacant expressions or cerebral palsy. Finally, the image of Keyzer Söze looms over the plot so much that the character is already an iconic figure way before appearing on the screen.On an overall scale, The Usual Suspects is a tense, confusing, captivating & entertaining cinema that delivers a mind-blowing experience the first time & is even more fun the second time around when you try to connect the dots from your first experience, and that's exactly when the film's biggest strength is revealed. It's so meticulously crafted with subtle placement of hints that it requires a bit of commitment from its audience but the reward in the end is incredibly fulfilling too. One of the defining works of 1990s cinema with a plot twist as legendary as Keyzer Söze himself, The Usual Suspects comes strongly recommended.",Null,0,0,9 August 2013
Inside Out," A Swashbuckling Return To Form For Pixar Animation Studios!
","A swashbuckling return to form for Pixar Animation Studios, Inside Out arrives as a strong jolt of freshness from the talented minds responsible for groundbreaking classics like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille & WALL·E, commences the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory, and in the process also reaffirms why Pixar is the most beloved, respected & finest animation studio on the planet.One of the most original, creative, intelligent, stunning & brightest ideas to come out from Pixar's repertoire in a very long time, Inside Out brims with sufficient dosage of intriguing concept, engaging storyline, rich characters, heartfelt emotions, gorgeous animation, stellar voice-cast & evocative score, and is an amalgamation of everything that has contributed in this famed studio's meteoric rise to the pinnacle of the animation film industry.A heartfelt tale about the difficulties of growing-up, Inside Out follows Riley: a young girl whose life hits a bumpy road when she is uprooted from her Midwest lifestyle after her father begins a new job in San Francisco, following which her emotions — Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust & Fear, work together in an effort to navigate her through this tough phase and help her adjust to her new life in the new city, house & school while Joy does her best to keep her happy.Co-written & directed by Pete Docter, Inside Out hits a third consecutive home-run for the director of Monsters, Inc. & Up, for it not only works as an inventive & imaginative feature film from the creative filmmaker but also succeeds as one of the most ambitious & audacious film projects undertaken by Pixar. The screenplay also wonderfully intertwines the two story lines set within the same picture; one concerning Riley while other following her emotions.Production Design team does a splendid job in creating the world for the emotions to reside in. Even those emotions are cleverly imagined, designed & rendered on the screen, and it's easy to identify one from its shape & colour alone. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera to capture every action in fine detail while its colour palette makes exquisite use of five different hues, each associated with a certain emotion, whose shades are applied to the whole world within the mind.Editing unfolds its narrative steadily & its 94 minutes of runtime is briskly paced. The score is composed by Michael Giacchino but isn't as memorable as I expected. The performance by its voice cast continues Pixar's tradition of coming up with a fitting ensemble that infuses new life into its animated characters and amongst all, it's Amy Poehler & Phyllis Smith (the voices of Joy & Sadness, respectively) who impress the most, share a wonderful chemistry, and are the very soul of Inside Out.But despite getting most things right, Inside Out isn't without its flaws for there are a few elements that don't work out in its favour. First is its attempt at humour which at times feels forced. Next up is Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong who is pretty annoying for the most part. Michael Giacchino's score is a letdown too as mentioned above. And finally, there's this contrast between its seemingly childish humour & the subject matter that's more oriented towards grown-ups, which hinders the overall enjoyment on few occasions.On an overall scale, Inside Out is the strongest Pixar film to surface on the big screen since Toy Story 3 that guarantees to take its viewers through every emotion and absolutely delivers on that promise. It shows that growing-up isn't always a fun, carefree experience and also illustrates the importance of sadness in our life as well as the changes any emotion can trigger in our behaviour. I'd been waiting a long time for Pixar to come up with a cinema like this & while it may not be as perfect as their finest works, it's destined to become a Pixar classic in the years to come.

Yesterday," An Interesting Concept Unrealised To Its Full Potential
","An interesting concept unrealised to its full potential, Yesterday never truly grasps the places it could've gone with its premise and settles for a half-baked idea that's not allowed to simmer far enough and is further diluted with a half-baked romance. On top of that, it's missing the kinetic flair that's often evident in Danny Boyle films.The story concerns a struggling musician who ends up in a freak accident during a mysterious global blackout & wakes up in an alternate timeline where The Beatles never existed. After realising that he's sitting on a goldmine, he starts playing their music, claiming them to be his own, and embarks on a journey to fame & stardom.Directed by Danny Boyle (28 Days Later & Steve Jobs), Yesterday neither entirely digs into the what-if scenario of a world without the Fab Four nor wholly embraces the romance subplot it has going on the side. Boyle struggles in juggling both plots, thus resulting in a finished product that lands far from what the premise promised.Despite the availability of so many routes to choose from, the film opts for the least interesting one and keeps returning to the romance part it could have done without anyway. Riding on the strength of the all-time greatest band's music, Himesh Patel delivers a fab showcase as the leading man while Lily James & the rest are alright at best.On an overall scale, Yesterday is severely underdeveloped in plot & characterisation and is nothing more than a hokey rom-com at its core. The Beatles' catalogue does make the ride a bit bright, breezy & bearable but the input from the cast & crew still leaves a lot to be desired. A wasted opportunity of sorts, Danny Boyle's latest is one of his weakest directorial efforts.While there is absolutely no denying that a world without The Beatles is a world that's infinitely worse, it turns out that a world with this film isn't any better either.",Null,1,1,15 September 2019

Quantum of Solace," Lacks The Secret Ingredient That Made Its Predecessor An Instant Classic
","It's actually funny how the rebooted series that began on such an astonishingly high note comes crashing down all the way in this second chapter as Quantum of Solace fails to accomplish everything a sequel is usually supposed to and is a massive downgrade in comparison to its predecessor with only compensation coming from Daniel Craig's brilliant performance as James Bond.Serving as a direct sequel to Casino Royale & picking up the story right where it was left off in the last chapter, Quantum of Solace continues Bond's quest for revenge against those responsible for Vesper's death & is assisted by another agent looking for retribution against the people who killed her family but their trail eventually leads them to a member of Quantum organisation in Bolivia.Directed by Marc Forster, the film opens with an amazing action sequence but after that, it only goes downstream. With the previous chapter stripping the series bare by getting rid of all the eye-candy gadgets & distracting elements to rely solely on its story & characters, the sequel suffers from this because these two basic aspects aren't properly handled this time.The plot is narrated in a hurried manner despite having moments that require it to slow down a bit, almost none of its supporting characters are interesting including the new Bond girls, Daniel Craig continues to assure that he's the right guy to take over this role, the plot tries to revel in its violence but without a good enough story to fall back upon, it doesn't contribute much to the overall experience.On an overall scale, Quantum of Solace turns out to be an accidental misstep that doesn't really hurt the franchise in any major way & has few interesting things going in its favour but after such a brilliant start provided by Casino Royale, this tumble was least expected. Not the Bond film I was looking forward to, Quantum of Solace misses out on the secret ingredient that made its predecessor an instant classic.",Null,0,3,9 December 2014
Independence Day," Heavily Flawed But Immensely Enjoyable As Well!
","From the director who once stated that he is 'a filmmaker, not a scientist' as his defense to the plethora of historical & scientific inaccuracies present in his movies, Independence Day remains Roland Emmerich's most enjoyable & unabashedly entertaining work to date and is the picture that introduced me to this weirdo. And although it offers the same ridiculousness as his other features, it still succeeds as a solid popcorn flick that was once at the forefront of large-scale disaster films.The story concerns an alien invasion against which the entire mankind unite to fight for its freedom. It begins on July 2 when the alien mothership enters the Earth's orbit & deploys several spaceships which take over the major cities of the world & annihilate them completely. On July 3, a counterattack is launched but turns out to be ineffective until a computer expert finds out a flaw in alien's advanced system. And so, July 4 becomes the day when humanity puts up its final fights for its freedom.Direction by Roland Emmerich here is actually top-notch when compared to his other works, writing employs all the flimsy narrative, clichéd dialogues & illogical plot developments, production design is stunning for its magnitude, visual effects were jaw-dropping at its time of release but now looks pretty dated, the camera-work is nicely carried out, editing isn't bad as the story is finely paced & the score by David Arnold has a very patriotic feel to it & keeps the drama flowing with excitement.Coming to the performances, its ensemble cast chips in with adequate contribution in the film & although there was no standout performance by anyone, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum & Bill Pullman still manage to make their characters work despite the lack of depth & characterization in the script itself. The entire alien advanced technology is beautifully portrayed as well plus I really admire the cool design of the spaceships, the meticulous detail in which it's all presented & the look of the aliens as well.On an overall scale, Roland Emmerich has made some of the worst films in his career but Independence Day isn't one of them. Sure it's flawed & relies on visual effects plus patriotic themes to hide most of it but then, it's also hard to not be amazed by its ambition & how it influenced the disaster genre. If you're looking for a fun, relaxing & exciting movie extravaganza to just chill out, then Independence Day is pretty much capable of delivering that experience.",Null,0,0,4 July 2014

Alien vs. Predator," It's PG-13 ... That Alone Says It All!
","After reviewing both Alien & Predator franchises last month, I thought it wouldn't be fair to leave out the very picture that simply killed the validity of those two reputed series in one shot. More a spin-off than a sequel or prequel in my book, AVP: Alien vs. Predator was destined to surface ever since the alien skull was discovered in that Predator's ship in Predator 2 but I can't help but wish it hadn't.Bringing together the two eponymous creatures of Alien & Predator series, the story of AVP: Alien vs. Predator is set in 2004 & follows a group of archaeologists assembled by Weyland for an expedition near the antarctic to investigate a mysterious heat signal where they discover an ancient pyramid buried beneath the ice. While exploring the pyramid, they find themselves caught in the middle of a battle between the two species.Written & directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this is the first film I've seen of his & well, I'm so not impressed. Why do humans even exist in this film? We could've simply had these two creatures battling their differences out on another planet without human intervention at all which sounds way cooler than having this dull set of undeveloped characters who bring the story down every time any of them appears on the screen at any given moment.The technical aspects is overall nicely carried out but its job is to compliment the narrative in a more engaging & polished manner but since the groundwork in the storytelling department is already weak here, none of those elements play any relevant role. Camera-work is fluid, editing is choppy, visual effects are impressive actually, music is forgettable & the very same goes for the performances by every single one of its cast.On an overall scale, AVP: Alien vs. Predator is an unnecessarily crafted movie that tries to keep the viewers interested in its premise by referencing the films that inspired it yet fails miserably. What's even more disappointing is that it doesn't even live up to its own name as the sequences depicting the two iconic species going against each other are too low in number & expectedly, those scenes are the only ones worth talking about to some extent, at least.",Null,1,1,1 November 2014
District 9," A Solidly Crafted, Intricately Layered & Thought-Provoking Study Of Humanity.
","A masterwork of originality, creativity & imagination, District 9 is a solidly crafted, intricately layered & thought-provoking study of humanity that's rich in themes, dense in emotions & accomplished in all storytelling aspects, and remains one of the most riveting & refreshing works of sci-fi filmmaking to surface on the silver screen in recent years.The title refers to the government camp where inhabitants of the alien ship that's been hovering over Johannesburg for the past three decades are confined to. The plot follows a bureaucrat who's tasked with the operation of relocating the extraterrestrials to another location, after conflicts between the aliens & locals worsens, but finds himself in a wholly different scenario when he gets exposed to their biotechnology.Co-written & directed by Neill Blomkamp in what is his feature film debut, District 9 is an outstanding start to his directional career and finds the up-n-coming filmmaker in total control as he utilizes all the available resources in an efficient manner to bring his tale to life. It's a sensational debut, not because Blomkamp has a clear idea of the story he wants to tell but also because he knows how to create just the right kind of curiosity to get the viewers on board.The screenplay features a relatively simple plot on the surface but is brimming with multitudes of themes on the inside. The story is compelling & character-driven, the character arcs are well-defined & exhibit welcome depth, the journey that our protagonist undergoes is emotionally stimulating and allows the audience to invest in it, for which they are handsomely rewarded in the end, and its commentary on xenophobia & segregation is only getting more relevant with time.Within its opening moments, the film is able to establish an aura of tension & conflict by concisely going through the events of the past to pave the groundwork for what's about to unfold in the present. The animosity between the two species isn't far from the xenophobic attitudes that's still rampant around the world. The ghetto & forced eviction elements are a glimpse into South Africa's own history. But not everything is depressing here, for there is a hint of hope to be found in our protagonist's transitional journey.The technical aspects work in tandem to highly enrich the overall experience. Cinematography employs the quasi-documentary shooting style and its grainy, hand-held camera-work & degrading color palette further amplify its bleak tone & desolate setting. Despite its seemingly high-concept sci-fi premise, the story has a very grounded feel to it, for it is more concerned with the human condition even when dealing with the extraterrestrials, whose repulsive, insect- like design doesn't hold the audience back from empathizing with their situation.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, David James & more relatively unknown actors who add a layer of authenticity to the film's documentary-like format. Copley plays his part with stunning flair & professionalism and paints a compelling & gut-wrenching portrait of a man who faces overwhelming odds when he's forced to confront his identity and eventually learns what it means to be human, and his performance only gets better as the plot progresses. The supporting actors are no slouch in their given roles and play their part accordingly.On an overall scale, District 9 has all the hallmarks of an instant classic and it launches the careers of both Blomkamp & Copley on a very promising note. It does run into few genre tropes, turns into an action bonanza in its final act, and lacks a proper closure but it still is endlessly fascinating, thoroughly engaging & highly entertaining, and packs more flesh than the majority of sci-fi extravaganzas that surface on the big screen every year. One of the best films of its year, one of the strongest debuts around, and definitely a worthy addition to its genre, District 9 is a stellar work of science-fiction. Strongly recommended.",Null,0,1,20 September 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Desolation of J.R.R. Tolkien's Spirit.
","When The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey premiered on silver screen as the first in a trilogy of films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, the response it received was mostly positive to mixed. The majority of criticism was targeted at the needless expansion of a single film story into three features but, in my opinion, it did commence this latest Middle-Earth adventure on the right note and, despite its sluggish pace, ended up providing a largely satisfying experience.The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the second chapter of The Hobbit film series & picks the story right from where it was left off in An Unexpected Journey. Continuing the adventures of Bilbo Baggins who's accompanying thirteen dwarfs on their quest to reclaim the kingdom of Erebor, the film covers the journey ahead for these fellows which is full of dangers and even if they manage to get away with it & reach the Lonely Mountain safely, they have a stupendous dragon to deal with.One thing I have always admired about this Middle-Earth franchise is the filmmaker's strong intent to keep the story very much within the realms of Tolkien's spirit. But this latest chapter marks a significant departure from such faithfulness & ends up being an immensely frustrating experience. There are a few things The Desolation of Smaug gets right but there are also way too many things that are wrong with it. Let's start with the things it gets right first.Since the previous chapter was criticized for its sluggish pace, the filmmakers have vastly improved the pacing in this middle chapter with addition of many more action sequences to keep the entertainment going throughout its runtime. Production design continues to amaze. Cinematography encapsulates the picture with a darker layer which suits its tone. Visual effects has its share of highs n lows & Howard Shore's score is good but it also stumbles a little for the very first time.Now coming to what's wrong with it... First, it slaughters the book in a manner that's plainly insulting to Tolkien. Second, the absurdly introduced love triangle, overindulgence of Elves & eye-rollingly cheesy dialogues are poor filler substitutes. Third, this film had a great opportunity to further develop its characters but thanks to its rushed pace & more emphasis on over-the-top action over a riveting narration, we still have difficulty in recalling the correct names of all the Dwarfs.And that's not all. Martin Freeman is brilliant as Bilbo Baggins but his character is demoted into a secondary role for the centre stage is taken by Richard Armitage's Thorin. The remaining Dwarfs get only as much screen time as they did in the last chapter. Elves have never been as annoying as they are in this film for Legolas wasn't even needed in this adventure & Tauriel, who doesn't even exist in the novel but was created to bring a feminine energy to the series, is given a stupid love story to work with instead.At last, I would like to talk about Smaug. Exquisitely designed, remarkably portrayed & meticulously detailed, this splendid beast of CGI is a jaw-dropping wonder to look at & the painstaking work that went into bringing this magnificent dragon to life truly deserves a bow. But thanks to its inefficient handling by the filmmakers, the cunning, proud & intelligent dragon of the novel is turned into a foolish creature here which is a shame because Smaug could've been as memorable to this trilogy as Gollum was to The Lord of the Rings.On an overall scale, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an emotionally unappealing but visually spectacular sequel which features a much more exciting, fiercely paced & action-packed entertainment that'll satisfy most filmgoers but for the devoted fans of Middle-Earth, it's a heartbreaking disappointment that adds even more insult to injury by abruptly ending at one of the most frustrating cliffhangers in cinema history, thus leaving the experience very much incomplete in the end.",Null,8,12,24 December 2013

Toy Story 4," A Final Goodbye We Didn't Know We Needed
","Toy Story 3 wrapped up Pixar's signature saga on such a pitch-perfect note that the decision to follow it up with another instalment made no sense at all. Nobody asked for this sequel. Nobody wanted it. And nobody was looking forward to it. However, if there is one thing that this animation studio has done too many times over the years and more consistently than any other studio on the planet, it is to defy the odds, exceed every expectation & set all-new industry benchmarks in the process.

Instead, this latest entry enriches it by embracing everything that made its predecessors so great. The story is immaculate, characters are vibrant & compelling, themes are addressed with care & compassion, animation is breathtaking, and the film as a whole brims with a genuine sense of heart, warmth, tenderness & finality.

Wreck-It Ralph," The Story Of A Regular Guy Just Looking For A Little 'Wreck-ognition'
","The year of 2012 was a wicked one for both Disney & Pixar as the two animation studios attempted to emulate the other one's forte in their very own features. Pixar's Brave marked its first foray into fairy tales, a subgenre that Disney pretty much owns, while Disney's Wreck-It Ralph employed Pixar's own formula of observing life from a different perspective, this time exploring the world of video game characters.The story of Wreck-It Ralph follows its eponymous character, an arcade game villain who is tired of playing the bad guy over the years & dreams of becoming a hero. Things are set in motion when he sneaks into a different game to win a medal of heroism but inadvertently unleashes a serious threat that could affect the entire arcade and ultimately crash-lands into another game where he meets a young 'glitch' who makes him realise what it is to be a hero.Directed by Rich Moore, Wreck-It Ralph begins really well and brims with a big splash of nostalgia for grown-ups & an inviting enough world for rug rats. Many notable characters from classic video games make their brief appearances plus it also incorporates their unique characteristics into the narrative. However, the second half of the story fails to live up to its brilliant first half and suffers from an overdose of sweetness that nearly ruins the whole picture.There are still a whole lot of positives for the arcade games it puts on screen are refreshing to look at, the script is sharply witted although there are some moments when it feels a bit too forced, the animation is top-notch for the images vary from 8-bit arcade games quality to modern console HD graphics yet there isn't any friction between the two distinct visuals for its integration is seamless. And the character of Ralph is quite relatable, features a surprising depth & a well-defined arc.Where the movie loses a few points is in the storyline set in the candy-coated cart racing game as that sugary sweet world & the characters it inhabits become annoying real soon. The vibrant, vivid colour palette, the kiddish humour & juvenile figures is more appealing to the younger audience. It does help in further developing Ralph's character arc but the sweetness is a tad too much to bear at times. The voice actors do a good job in their given roles, with John C. Reilly being the standout choice.On an overall scale, Wreck-It Ralph has something in store for viewers of all ages, is a wonderfully animated tale that's full of colours, joy & nostalgia, effectively delivers on the entertainment scale, and sensibly covers the themes of responsibility, identity & isolation. Smartly balancing the retro & new school vibe and featuring a tale that's approachable, accessible & amusing, Wreck-It Ralph is a definite surprise from Disney and would've left an even bigger impression if it hadn't gotten a bit carried away. Nevertheless, absolutely worth a shot.",Null,0,1,8 April 2016
To Rome With Love," Woody Allen's Love Affair With Europe Continues In This Disjointed Mess Of A Motion Picture
","Not amongst Woody Allen's finest works but still exhibiting some charm, fun & delight of an Allen film, To Rome with Love is a collection of four story lines that are totally unrelated to each other that deals with themes of adultery, fame, fantasy & other stuffs and while it lacks the element of surprise, it still makes up for a pleasant, light-hearted entertainment.The story of To Rome with Love follows four intertwined but unrelated narratives. The first is about a clerk who wakes up one day to find himself a national celebrity. The second follows an architect who's reminiscing his student years in the streets of Rome. The third concerns a young couple who are on their honeymoon, and the last one is about a girl's parents who arrive in Italy to meet the family of her fiancé.Written & directed by Woody Allen, To Rome with Love continues the esteemed filmmaker's love affair with European cities and finds him photographing Rome & all its rich beauty in a colourful manner. The plot looks as if Allen came up with four different ideas for a story set in Rome and decided to include all of them into one without offering any connection whatsoever which turns the whole experience into a wonderment for what exactly was his purpose here.These quadruple snippets aren't compelling either for the different plots just unfold without any sense of direction or any sort of interconnection. Cinematography is a real highlight for the camera gorgeously captures the lush wonders of Rome, made all the more beautiful by its exquisite use of colour palette & bright lighting. The film also offers some laughs over the course of its runtime but none of its amusing moments stays around once the end credits start rolling.Coming to the performances, the movie features a star-studded ensemble in Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penélope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig & Ellen Page and although none of them leave a lasting impression, the sum of parts isn't all too shabby. But it's not the actors who are to be blamed since their scripted characters doesn't have any meat on them. Also, a few of them actually try to make up for that shortcoming by chipping in with some effort that never quite pays off.On an overall scale, To Rome with Love sounds like one of those flicks that was crafted just as an excuse to make something in the city of Rome. It sure qualifies as a wonderful ode to this attractive European destination but the story is a disappointment, even if there are few laughs to be had in between, plus every character inhabiting it only feels incomplete in one way or another. Frustrating at times but never really boring, To Rome with Love is funny in little doses plus has its moments but as a whole, it lacks the inventiveness of Woody Allen's best works.",Null,3,5,8 October 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Middle-Earth Comes Alive In Breathtaking Detail, Once Again.
","J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings did cement Tolkien's legacy into the annals of literature but it wasn't the novel that really started the Middle-Earth mythology. Instead, it began years ago when Tolkien wrote a fantasy novel called The Hobbit, a children's book very lighthearted & innocent in its tone compared to its much darker successor.Decades later, at the dawn of the new millennium, The Lord of the Rings made a historical transition to the silver screen. And so when the filmmakers decided to adapt The Hobbit on film canvas as well, they didn't only have to make it reasonably faithful to its source material but also had a daunting task of living up to the mighty successful on-screen adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.And thanks to the mixed reviews this film received at its time of release, which as a result dented my expectations from it quite heavily, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turned out to be an absolute feast for the eyes & is one hell of an on-screen adaptation of Tolkien's work which, in my opinion, is unfortunately marred by only one major drawback; its inevitable comparison to The Lord of the Rings.Serving as a prequel to the events depicted in The Lord of the Rings, An Unexpected Journey is the first chapter in the planned trilogy & follows the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who is tricked by Gandalf the Grey into joining the company of thirteen dwarfs headed by Thorin Oakenshield in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain & reclaim their lost Kingdom of Erebor from Smaug the dragon.Expanding a relatively slim book into three major feature films when the entire story could've been told in a single film did allow Peter Jackson the opportunity to milk almost every event of the book for all its worth but it also robbed the film of a steadier pace. Nevertheless, Jackson's direction once again brings Middle-Earth alive in all its majesty & he does a neat job in bringing this chapter as close as possible to his magnum opus.Coming to the technical aspects, the production design team does a fabulous job in bringing back the homely Bag End, the evergreen Shire & the dazzling Rivendell on the big screen plus the new sets are equally stunning to look at. Cinematography captures each frame in meticulous detail, editing is a let down this time & unlike The Lord of the Rings, even the extended edition doesn't add much to the overall experience.The visual effects of The Lord of the Rings commenced a new era for VFX in film & was a groundbreaking feat of its time. The Hobbit unfortunately brings nothing new to the table & its heavy reliance on CGI over practical effects robs the film of the grounded realism the previous trilogy had. Lastly, the film is beautifully scored from start to finish & marks another glorious achievement in Howard Shore's career.Featuring an ensemble cast of new & reprising actors, Martin Freeman & Ian McKellen deliver outstanding performances as Bilbo Baggins & Gandalf the Grey, respectively. There are thirteen dwarfs in this nearly three hours long film & yet only one of them gets a proper introduction. However, it's Andy Serkis once again who steals the show as Gollum plus the riddle sequence between him & Bilbo is the only moment when this film felt as magical as The Lord of the Rings.On an overall scale, despite its bloated length & other inconsistencies, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is still an unexpectedly impressive commencement of another Middle-Earth adventure. There are few missteps along the road but most of its footing is spot-on. Faithfully adapted, wonderfully crafted & cleverly concluded, An Unexpected Journey may not be as memorable or spellbinding as The Lord of the Rings but it nevertheless begins The Hobbit film series on a right note & it'll be very interesting to see where it journeys from here.",Null,10,20,28 December 2012
Before Sunset," Nine Years Later... It's Still As Good or Even Better This Time
","Before Sunset is a sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise & is set 9 years after the events of the first film. Jesse has published an autobiographical book about the events we witnessed in the previous chapter and is out on a promotion tour to help its sale in Europe. While promoting the book in Paris, the last destination after which he should head back to New York, he happens to meet Céline again and thus, we embark on another single day adventure with these two people which is once again constrained by time and just like the original, it is all about conversations shaping up the film's story, plot & presents an all new dimensions of the now older characters.The direction by Linklater is as good as the previous film, the screenplay may not have the freshness of Before Sunrise but it sure is more mature & wiser and also incorporates writing credits from its lead actors. The cinematography nicely captures few beautiful locations of Paris but the most impressive thing about the camera this time is that the entire story from start to finish gives an appearance of being shot in real time and is expertly edited. The performances from Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy as Jesse & Celine, respectively, is fantastic once again and their chitchat about the past 9 years, jobs & relationships feels absolutely natural while also bringing on surface their maturity & still existing feelings for one another.On an overall scale, Before Sunset turns out to be a sequel that in the end was very much worth its nine years wait and just like its predecessor is one of the finest films of the its genre. Plus the script, which references the previous film to some extent, still has enough strength to succeed as a standalone product and even if you see it without seeing Before Sunrise, you will most probably still end up loving it. But it's better to follow the pattern, in my opinion, as that gives Before Sunset a broader, much evolved look, thus making it an ingenious successor. Before Sunrise is one of the best films there is in the romance genre. And Before Sunset joins it as another equally heartwarming chapter covering another day in the lives of Jesse & Celine. Don't miss it.",Null,0,0,8 January 2014
The Princess Bride," A Classic Fairy Tale With A Lot of Heart, Warmth & Charm.
","A romance, a comedy, an adventure & a fantasy, The Princess Bride is an amalgamation of all of these and is a fairy tale that has been passed from fathers to sons for generations and here is presented in the form of a novel that is being read by a grandfather to his grandson, thus making sure that the book's narrative style & structure is kept entirely preserved.The Princess Bride tells the story of Buttercup who falls in love with a farm guy but loses him and is at last engaged to the Prince of the region. One day, she is kidnapped & held against her will by three hired helpers; a Sicilian boss, a Spanish swordsman & a giant. But they soon find themselves being pursued by a mysterious masked man who's gaining on their trail.Rob Reiner has directed some well-known classics (A Few Good Men, Stand by Me & When Harry Met Sally...) but most people are still not familiar with his name because unlike other filmmakers, he has no unique style of shooting a film or possesses a trademark. And this is another one of his films that's pretty different in style & approach when compared to his other works. And Reiner does a good job at it.The screenplay is adapted from the book of the same name in a manner that preserves its narrative style, camera-work & editing nicely compliment each other, visuals effects never aims for a realistic portrayal of the world depicted in the story plus it benefits very much from its sweet, tender & pleasant performances from its cast, including Andre the Giant.On an overall scale, there isn't much wrong with The Princess Bride & carries out most of its elements the way it's meant to be. More entertaining than what I was expecting from it, definitely showing a lot of heart, warmth & charm and yet it didn't click enough with me for I'm not really a fan of fairy tales. But for those who've read the book or heard the story or even many newcomers, this will be a delightful experience.",Null,3,3,20 September 2014
Saving Private Ryan," One of the Greatest War Films of Its or Any Other Time
","Within the opening 30 minutes into Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg simply rewrote everything there ever was about warfare filmmaking, destroyed many Hollywood clichés in the process, completely redefined the combat genre & permanently cemented this film's place amongst the greatest examples of war cinema.The movie opens with the devastating but successful invasion of Normandy by Allied powers during the Second World War & the main plot surfaces after that. It concerns a band of soldiers who are assigned a new mission to go behind enemy lines in order to retrieve a missing soldier whose all brothers have been killed in action.Steven Spielberg's direction this time challenges & breaks every barrier of action filmmaking as this film is his all out assault on the film audience' psyche & takes them right into the battlefield with all the blood, bullets & limbs flying around. Add to that, the camera-work with its desaturated colour & point of view shooting gives the plot a heightened sense of realism too.Just like any other Spielberg's movie, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much fine tuned in its technical departments as the editing, visual effects, sound & everything is top-notch although John Williams' score doesn't have much to contribute to the whole film. The performances by its ensemble cast are also very good with Hanks impressing the most with his swashbuckling performance.Yet, in spite of all the praise & it putting up perhaps the most harrowing depiction of war on- screen, it isn't a flawless work & comes with its share of disappointments. The biggest drawback about Saving Private Ryan is that after its unforgettable opening sequence, the film is never able to reach the same height for the entirety of its runtime & even drags in the middle of its story only to rise again in the end.Another major problem I have with it is the film's relentless emphasis on glorifying America since some real-life events depicted here completely ignore the aid US received from other allies during the D-Day landings plus the extremely biased manner in which it portrays the German soldiers is absolutely insulting. It's specifically made for American audience & doesn't have a universal appeal like many other films of its genre.On an overall scale, Saving Private Ryan presents its esteemed director at his brutal best and with its unflinching take on the horrors of war delivers an extremely intense, powerfully moving, brutally realistic & truly unforgettable cinematic experience. It may not be the greatest war film ever made but its contribution to warfare filmmaking has been immense. And for that alone, it will forever be remembered as one of its genre's finest works.",Null,2,3,1 December 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Lacks the Fiery Energy of the Original. Still, A Worthy Sequel in More Ways Than One.
","In the summer of 2010, DreamWorks Animation released their finest feature in the form of How To Train Your Dragon, which surprised everyone with its remarkable balance between story & animation elements and remains a rollicking adventure for all ages. Surfacing 4 years later amidst enormous hype is How To Train Your Dragon 2 and how does it fare in comparison to its predecessor? Let's find out.Set 5 years after the events of the first film, How To Train Your Dragon 2 continues the expedition of Hiccup & his pet dragon, Toothless, as they embark on a new journey to discover & map unexplored lands & territories. But when they come across a secret ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons & meet the mysterious Dragon Rider, Hiccup soon realizes that a larger conflict brewing between humans & dragons and finds himself at the centre of it.Although there is no denying that unlike most sequels, How To Train Your Dragon 2 never tries to play it safe, takes the road-less-travelled, tries many new things in the process, pushes its story to uncharted places & I really admire what the filmmakers were trying to do but in the end, it comes out slightly undercooked thanks to its unpolished script that could've been benefited from a little more refinement.Like its predecessor, the animation is absolutely dazzling, the dragons are vividly imagined, designed & rendered, the camera-work is expertly handled and John Powell's score wonderfully supports the entire narrative. But unlike the last film, the humour this time feels unnecessarily forced at some stages, the new characters aren't developed at all & everything that made the previous film a genre classic doesn't blend as well this time.On an overall scale, How To Train Your Dragon 2 is an exciting follow-up to DreamWorks Animation's finest feature that has a certain amount of freshness & originality of its own, is finely directed & lively scored and despite its shortcomings, most of which arose due to my really high expectations from it, this fun-filled adventure somehow manages to deliver an entertainment that's worth your time & money.",Null,2,8,19 June 2014

The plot details his miraculous survival against all odds which wouldn't have happened without the kindness of few compassionate humans.Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist does bring back the horrors of the Holocaust and never shies away from depicting the barbaric treatment millions of Jews underwent during Nazi occupation. But it's not a tale about someone who caused an uprising or put his life on the line to save others but through one person, it tries to capture what most people under same circumstances were trying to do: survive, no matter what it takes.Polanski does manage to infuse his own history into the story but never lets that distract his own vision for the picture at hand, and there in lies the true beauty of this survival story. It's arguably the finest film that he's made & certainly the most artistic. Adding more strength to the feature is the brilliantly-written screenplay that keeps the focus on our protagonist at all times & resonates the brutality that millions underwent through his own life story.Coming to the technical aspects, every single element only ends up enhancing the entire experience. Production Design team does a superb job in recreating the war-torn city & set pieces are refined to smallest of details. Cinematography makes impeccable use of camera in capturing every frame plus the cold colour temperature encapsulates the whole film with a bleak mood. Editing paces its 149 minutes of runtime with precision. And classical music is beautifully incorporated into the narrative.Another thing that seals the destiny of The Pianist is the exceptional performance by Adrien Brody in the role of Władysław Szpilman that simply exceeded every expectation. Perfectly capturing not just the feeling of hopelessness, loneliness, grief & living under constant fear but also the desperation, survival instinct & passion for music, what Brody delivers here is one of cinema's most memorable performances that still ranks as his best and his Academy Award win for this role was deserving in every manner.On an overall scale, The Pianist marks the career high moment for Roman Polanski & Adrien Brody, is an emotionally devastating & powerfully moving cinema that's worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far, and is amongst the finest examples of historical drama in existence. It certainly isn't going to be an easy sit for most but you'll be a better person for having done because some films, no matter how difficult, deserve to be viewed, and Roman Polanski's magnum opus is definitely one of those cinematic treasures.

The Grand Budapest Hotel," Check Into The Grand Budapest Hotel, As Soon As Possible.
","When it comes to director Wes Anderson, there is only one thing that's present everywhere in every one of his works that makes his films all the more unique; the eccentricity. But more on that later. Set in the fictional Republic of Zubrowska, The Grand Budapest Hotel recounts the adventures of Monsieur Gustave H, the charming & devoted concierge of the famed hotel who teams up with one of his employees to prove his innocence after he's framed for the murder of one of hotel's most regular guests.Those who are accustomed to this director's previous works know that his films present an immensely distinct visual flair that's seamlessly blended with quirky wit, eclectic dialogues & idiosyncratic characters to give its viewers a bizarre cinematic experience. And his latest feature is no different as it's very emblematic of his style, has a tremendous charm to it, is exquisitely photographed, finely edited & peculiarly scored by Alexandre Desplat.Coming to the performances, The Grand Budapest Hotel features a stellar cast in which each actor is assigned an odd character to play on the screen & is introduced to the viewers in Anderson's usually unusual style. But it's Ralph Fiennes as Gustave H whose stylish appearance, rapid-fire delivery & dry wit ended up making the biggest impression. The next best for me was Willem Dafoe who ends up delivering a cold-blooded performance as a cold-blooded assassin.On an overall scale, The Grand Budapest Hotel bears all the signatures of a Wes Anderson's feature & maybe even more. It's arguably his most accessible work to date that's exquisitely designed & elegantly composed. It's like a delicious dessert course that is delicately served to its viewers & is one of this year's sweetest, quirkiest, funniest & most enjoyable films as of now. So just leave your doubts behind & check into The Grand Budapest Hotel, as soon as possible.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,1,4,14 June 2014
The Favourite," Yorgos Lanthimos' Most Accessible Film To Date
","From the director of The Lobster & The Killing of a Sacred Deer comes yet another idiosyncratic feature, this time a period comedy set in 18th century England. The Favourite may be more accessible than Yorgos Lanthimos' previous efforts but the film certainly isn't devoid of the absurd, whacky elements that define his works.The story takes place in 18th century England and focuses on the power struggle that erupts between a frail queen who occupies the throne, her close friend who governs the country in her stead & a new servant with an agenda of her own who steps between the two after she senses an opportunity to realise her ambitions.Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the first act is an absolute riot that finds the Greek filmmaker doing what he does best with a series of quirky moments that help set up the stage while introducing the relevant characters whose arcs only get more complex as plot progresses. The story is straightforward but the execution leads to one wicked ride.The skilfully executed technical aspects provide excellent assistance, starting with the sumptuous production & costume design that brings the period setting to life in splendid detail. The exquisite use of fisheye lens, smooth camera manoeuvring & low-light photography provide its frames a bizarre but lifelike quality that's all the more uplifted by its eclectic score.But it's the female trio that power this film. Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz & Emma Stone lead the show with outstanding inputs and their chemistry with each other only intensifies with time. All three of them get to have their shining moment and make the most of their screen space. But Nicholas Hoult also deserves a mention, for his supporting act doesn't go unnoticed in a film steered by terrific actresses.On an overall scale, The Favourite is a tale of power, passion & politics bolstered by first-rate performances from its leading ladies, and marks another fascinating entry in Yorgos Lanthimos' steadily rising career. The third act doesn't really hold as strong as the first two but there is no denying that it's a well crafted & smartly executed work from a filmmaker in prime form. Worth a shot for the powerhouse performances it has in store. And the power dynamics at play. And that duck race!",Null,1,3,3 January 2019
1941," An End Product Of Steven Spielberg's Hubris
","There comes a time in every new filmmaker's career when a few initial successes makes them feel invulnerable and leads them to believe that they can do anything and get away with it, only for their hubris to be mercilessly destroyed when their next project turns out to be an absolute disaster.1941 is an end product of Steven Spielberg's hubris that presents the now revered filmmaker tackling the genre of comedy after finding astonishing success with Jaws & Close Encounters, but this time he spectacularly fails at it. Arguably the worst film of his career, 1941 is nothing less than an eyesore.Set during the Second World War, the story of 1941 follows the hysteria that grips the Californians in the wake of the bombing of Pearl Harbour. As paranoia sets in & chaos erupts all over the state, civilians & soldiers prepare for the Japanese invasion, while a lost Japanese submarine sends its crew to scout out the madness.Directed by Steven Spielberg, 1941 finds the director trying way too hard in an effort to make the audience laugh but he only ends up making a mess of everything in the process. It appears as if Spielberg simply wanted to blow everything up and had his wish fulfilled with this big budget, big cast comedy that isn't even remotely funny.The film is an exaggeration of everything. All the set pieces are either destroyed or blown up by the end. People keep falling here n there throughout the movie. All the characters are hyperactive. Performances are equally crazy, and not in a good way. Still, its energetic camerawork, extravagant special effects & John Williams' score is a plus.On an overall scale, 1941 is a poorly conceived, awfully written & terribly executed example of blockbuster filmmaking and is a rare failure from a filmmaker who would later go on to become one of the greatest storytellers of all time. In retrospect, it's a bitter medicine that Spielberg needed, for 1941 didn't just knock some sense back into him and sober him up but also made him savour his future successes and not take his reputation for granted. A necessary dud.",Null,4,5,15 January 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," An Explosive Blend Of Action, Humour & Spectacle
","The fourth instalment in the Mission: Impossible series continues the strong momentum this action spy franchise gained in the previous chapter and delivers yet another swashbuckling ride that promises loads of thrills, action, excitement, entertainment & spectacle from start to finish, and is also notable for marking a sensational live-action filmmaking debut for the animation wizard, Brad Bird.The story of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol follows IMF Agent Ethan Hunt & his team whose latest mission in Russia is compromised when the Kremlin is bombed. With all blame pointing towards IMF, the US President initiates Ghost Protocol which disavows the agency, following which Hunt & his team go rogue and try to apprehend the guy responsible for the attack in order to clear their organisation's name.Directed by Brad Bird, the creative mind behind animation masterpieces like The Iron Giant, The Incredibles & Ratatouille, Ghost Protocol marks his first stint with live-action filmmaking and presents the esteemed filmmaker in prime form for Bird has crafted this film with same rigour, passion & imagination as his earlier works and greatly impresses with his excellent understanding of what makes an action sequence stand out.The screenplay packs in a gripping storyline that makes splendid use of wit & its attention to characters isn't half-hearted either. Cinematography exhibits the most balanced use of camera in the series so far while the images photographed with IMAX cameras leave a mark of its own. Editing expertly paces its 133 minutes of runtime. And Michael Giacchino returns to contribute another fascinating soundtrack that beautifully compliments the narrative.Coming to the performances, Ghost Protocol features a reliable cast in Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Paula Patton & Michael Nyqvist with added inputs from Léa Seydoux, Tom Wilkinson & Anil Kapoor. Cruise is totally committed to what remains his most popular role to date, Renner does well with what he's given, Pegg is effortlessly hilarious, Patton is simply terrific, Nyqvist is passable, so is Seydoux while Kapoor is downright laughable.On an overall scale, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is another impressive addition in the Mission: Impossible series that's jam-packed with blockbuster elements, is narrated in a streamlined manner, and succeeds in delivering an action extravaganza that scores high in both quality & quantity. Worth your time & money for that Burj Khalifa sequence alone, easily one of the most breathtaking segments ever filmed, Ghost Protocol comes as a must for every action fanatic out there.

Foxcatcher," Three Strong Performances Make Foxcatcher A Less Tedious Affair
","From the director of Capote & Moneyball comes another biopic, this time concerning the multi- millionaire John du Pont which mainly covers his relationship with 1984 Olympic gold medalists, Mark & Dave Schultz. And even though Foxcatcher looks like an interesting character study on paper, the film itself is quite a tedious experience for the most part.The story of Foxcatcher concerns John du Pont; heir of the multimillionaire Du Pont family & a wrestling enthusiast who recruits the 1984 Olympic gold medal-winning US wrestlers & brothers, Mark & Dave Schultz, in order to help coach aspiring US wrestlers for upcoming tournaments. The plot also tries to capture the relationship dynamics between these three characters.Directed by Bennett Miller, the film starts working on developing a motive behind what actually led real-life John du Pont take such an extreme action considering that there's possibly none in reality but it's so static, uninspiring & unappealing at times that it becomes a chore rather than an immersive drama. The technical aspects are fine mostly but it's the performances where the film excels.The cast comprises of Steve Carell, Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo, and the trio have done a terrific job in their given roles. It's a shame that the narrative is unable to keep the interest alive for the actors gave everything they had & are simply fabulous. Carell obviously is the biggest surprise here as the unhinged character but chemistry between Tatum & Ruffalo is also pretty much spot-on.On an overall scale, Foxcatcher feels like one of those boring lectures featuring a teacher who's is reading out loud in front of the class but simply lacks the imagination to make the lectures interesting or engaging for the students. It had the resources & it had a fitting cast to pull it off but in the end, there's no reward for sitting through this slow burner.

28 Days Later...," The Dawn Of A New Era Of Zombie Horror
","Signifying the dawn of a new era of post-apocalyptic horror, Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later... is the biggest leap zombie horror has taken ever since George A. Romero established the sub-genre in 1968 with Night of the Living Dead. The film discards the now outdated concept of reanimated corpses & replaces it with a contemporary idea of a viral epidemic, thus changing the supernatural phenomenon into a psychological one.The film opens with a prologue that teases with the origin of a highly contagious virus which amplifies the rage behaviour in infected humans, thus turning them into aggressive, zombie-like beings. The story concerns Jim who wakes up in an abandoned hospital 28 days after the disease outbreak only to find the entire city of London completely deserted. The story focuses on the struggle of Jim & few other survivors who try to cope with this unexpected turn of events.Directed by Danny Boyle, the film is as enjoyable & entertaining as it is inventive in reimagining the entire notion of the living dead. The concept takes a more realistic approach than before, adds several upgrades to the zombies' characteristics & many of the sequences depicted in the film serve as an allegory to various current events happening around the world. Screenplay lacks a certain level of depth yet it manages to work well for the most part.Cinematography makes excellent use of digital photography with many sequences having the appearance of being shot on a camcorder, whose grainy resolution adds a grisly tone to the whole picture. Editing skilfully trims & rearranges the different angles into one chaotic shot throughout its runtime and never lets the viewers settle down. And John Murphy's score covers a wide range but the best track is saved for & plays a key role in its perfectly executed climax.Coming to the acting department, the film features an unusual cast in Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson & Megan Burns but it's their balanced performances and wonderful chemistry with each other which adds little warmth to a rather gloomy feature. Also, the decision to make the zombies run faster rather than limp all the way turns out to be a masterstroke as it makes them all the more frightening than ever before.On an overall scale, 28 Days Later infuses new life into the genre that was slowly heading towards the grave, and presents Danny Boyle at the top of his game. It begins a new era of zombie films & its influence can already be felt in many flicks of its genre that followed it. Violent, chaotic & unsettling yet beautiful, amusing & entertaining, 28 Days Later is one flick no horror fanatic should miss out. Thoroughly recommended.",Null,0,1,14 October 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," An Epic of Epic Proportions
","One of the grandest epics ever produced on film celluloid, Lawrence of Arabia isn't just a film but a journey of a man's life & his love for a nation, and even with its nearly 4 hours of runtime, it manages to keep the viewers completely glued to their seats, thanks to the sheer magic of David Lean's stellar direction, breathtaking photography, stunning production design, spectacular score & Peter O'Toole's dominating performance.Set during the First World War, Lawrence of Arabia follows the life of a controversial British figure named T. E. Lawrence and covers his experiences in the Arab Peninsula where he was sent to investigate the progress of Arab revolt against the Turks & later leads them in winning their cause. The film opens with Lawrence's death in a motorcycle accident & then recount his adventures in flashbacks, as well as his inner conflicts with where his loyalties truly belong.Impressively directed by David Lean, this was one of the most ambitious projects of its time & the seamless manner in which Lean is able to keep it all intact despite its grandeur size is worthy of praise. The screenplay keeps its focus on Lawrence almost all the time & even the whole narrative is presented from his point of view. But where the film truly leaves an indelible mark in the annals of cinema is in its visual presentation.Be it the vast deserts, seas or landscapes, rising of the sun or calmness of the night, the camera-work is absolutely spellbinding for the captured images are sharp, meticulously detailed & have a remarkable level of clarity to it. The first half of the film is as flawless as its photography but the second half does stumble in its pacing which is my only complaint from this feature. And Maurice Jarre's legendary score is as epic as the film itself.Coming to the performances, Lawrence of Arabia is Peter O'Toole's show all the way for the actor brought T. E. Lawrence to life with sublime finesse and his work in this feature isn't just the best of his career but also deserves to be placed amongst cinema's finest performances. And even though O'Toole somehow overshadows the rest of the performances, Alec Guinness portrayal of Prince Faisal does manage to stand out.On an overall scale, Lawrence of Arabia is a historic tale of one man's struggle to bring freedom to the country he has fall head over heels in love with, and is aesthetically pleasing, artistically sublime & isn't devoid of any entertainment factor either. Undoubtedly one of the most influential films ever made & widely counted amongst the greatest films of all time, Lawrence of Arabia is an epic of epic proportions & comes highly recommended.",Null,0,1,11 October 2013
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A Worthy Sequel To Its Revolutionary Predecessor
","I don't care! I just don't care if Steven Spielberg himself grew disenchanted with this sequel while filming it because what he ended up putting on screen is still, in my opinion, a worthy follow-up to its revolutionary predecessor. Its inevitable comparison to Jurassic Park is its biggest downfall but The Lost World: Jurassic Park remains a highly satisfying successor to the original that offers its own set of thrills & entertainment that simply work.Set 4 years after the events of Jurassic Park, The Lost World follows Dr. Ian Malcolm who, after meeting with John Hammond, assembles a team to set off to the Site B island (where dinosaurs are allowed to roam freely) in order to get back his girlfriend who's already there to conduct her research. Once on the site, his team discovers that they're not the only one as another team from InGen arrives to take the dinosaurs back to the mainland but once again, everything soon spirals out of control.Written by David Koepp & directed by Steven Spielberg, The Lost World takes the viewers back to the world of living dinosaurs, this time filling the screen with more dinosaurs, many more body counts & even bigger entertainment. The direction retains Spielberg's ability to provide a sense of wonder & amazement but it also goes a bit far than required this time as a few sequences look ridiculous. The screenplay is downgraded too with more emphasis on action than story or characters yet it works for the most part.Coming to the technical aspects, Production design team does a fantastic job in recreating the same world we witnessed back in 1993 and the set pieces are wonderfully detailed too. Cinematography makes more dynamic use of camera than the first one due to more action, plus various sequences benefit immensely due to the energetic camera-work. Editing never lets the pace settle down n unfolds the story briskly while John Williams once again chips in with a thrilling score that exquisitely captures the different tone of this chapter.What Jurassic Park brought on screen during its time of release was something never done before, never seen before & never experienced before, at least not in such realistic manner. It was a landmark moment in cinema history that opened up many new territories previously thought to be unattainable through existing filmmaking means. And what this sequel lacks is that same level of freshness for much of the picture is simply a rehash of the original and tries to make up for what it lacks by amplifying its action, at which it succeeds.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Richard Attenborough, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn & others, with all doing a good job in their given roles. But just like the original, it's the dinosaurs who rule this film since almost every sequence featuring them is a delight to watch. Visuals & Sound is state-of-the-art stuff like before and the film brims with plenty of jaw-dropping sequences that exhibit the remarkable skills of Spielberg when it comes to larger-than-life action moments.On an overall scale, The Lost World: Jurassic Park gets a lot of flak for following a formulaic route as well as its lack of interesting human characters but for any dinosaur aficionado like me, it delivers everything that was expected from it. Whether it's the scenes involving the two T-Rex or Velociraptors or Stegosaurus or Compsognathus or that infamous San Diego mayhem, there's almost nothing that I don't like about this sequel for it stays true to the spirit of the original and is just as entertaining as Jurassic Park, if not more.",Null,1,2,14 October 2013
It Follows," It Doesn't Think. It Doesn't Feel. It Doesn't Give Up. It Follows.
","Retro in style, accomplished in production & very effective in execution, It Follows is an expertly crafted, skilfully narrated & ingeniously composed indie horror which arrives as a refreshing take on its genre that beautifully blends the aesthetics of John Carpenter films with contemporary indie settings to deliver a cinema that's creepy, sinister & downright chilling.It Follows tells the story of Jay; a college student whose life is turned upside down when, after an innocent sexual encounter, she's informed by her date that he passed on a curse to her, the curse being a supernatural entity which will now be pursuing her at all times & the only probable way to get rid of it is to pass the curse along to others before the entity gets to her.Written & directed by David Robert Mitchell, the film manages to create an impending sense of doom within its opening moments & never lets it settle down until the end credits start rolling. The screenplay also deserves a mention because the story, despite its laughable premise, isn't paper-thin but digs much deeper than expected & can be interpreted in more ways than one.Coming to the technical aspects, It Follows makes efficient use of its resources, starting with the 80s vibe it is able to evoke with its detailed set pieces & remote locations. The way its camera uses the stillness, 360-degree pans & slow zooms make the experience all the more unsettling. And Editing is a gem in itself that paces its 100 minutes of runtime in a very controlled manner.But the best thing about It Follows is its magnificent score. Composed by Disasterpeace & comprising of heavily synthesised tracks, the soundtrack contributes greatly in sustaining the film's nail-biting tension & amplifying its suspense. Coming to the performances which isn't really the film's strongest suit, Maika Monroe is possibly the only one who manages to make her mark, even if it happens in bits n pieces.Despite all that, I can't help but feel quite underwhelmed by the whole experience because, considering the universal acclaim it has garnered ever since it made its debut on the silver screen, I expected much more than what it had in store. It's not that what it offers isn't impressive, it's actually pretty amazing to be honest, but that abrupt ending was quite unexpected & certainly leaves behind a feeling of incompleteness.On an overall scale, It Follows is in every way a welcome addition to its genre that never abandons its menacing tone for some cheap thrills and certainly carries more substance than the majority of horror films released in the past few years. Even if this minimalist horror isn't frightening on a visceral scale, the fearsome aura it is able to generate over the course of its runtime is sure to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats.

Cars," Definitely Not As Mediocre As I Was Led To Believe
","While not as transcending as their previous efforts, Cars still manages to do enough to keep alive Pixar's winning streak & presents its pioneering animation studio slowing down a little just to catch its breath after having left behind all its competitors down in the dust during its first decade of filmmaking, and is certainly not as mediocre as many have called it to be.Set in a world populated entirely by automobiles & other vehicles, the story of Cars follows a racing rookie who, while travelling to California for the tiebreaker race that will determine the champion of the Piston Cup, finds himself waylaid in Radiator Springs & is tasked with repairing the damages he incurred on his arrival but ends up learning the true value of life during his stay.Steered by John Lasseter (director of Toy Story, A Bug's Life & Toy Story 2), Cars opens with an exciting racing sequence that instantly puts on screen everything one needs to know about its world but once the main plot surfaces, it soon loses its firepower, crawls throughout the middle section but manages to find its pace again near the end to at least finish on a respectable note, if not a high one.There's no denying that behind the scene work here is very impressive & is carried out with relentless dedication plus further advancement in the computer animation is highly evident in those landscape shots but this time, the script suffers for the story isn't engaging in any manner & unlike their previous efforts, appears to me more targeted at children because of which many might have a tough time sitting through it.Not everything is bad in this world inhabited by anthropomorphic vehicles for it looks truly stunning on camera as the depicted locations are beautifully rendered, Randy Newman's score is fairly good, voice cast is pretty interesting & the final race does lift the entire film to an extent but there's a whole lot of superfluous content to go through before we get there & with no memorable characters, that road isn't smooth enough.On an overall scale, Cars follows Pixar's tradition of heading into the unknown but due to a lack of strong foundation this time, it doesn't really succeed with flying colours. Definitely not amongst their finest works but Cars somehow manages to stay afloat instead of simply drowning & in many ways, can be seen as a deep breath before the plunge for what Pixar unleashed in their next 4 features took their creativity & legacy to an all-time high.",Null,0,1,7 October 2013
Legend," A Crime Drama That's Completely Devoid Of Any Sort Of Escalation!
","Despite featuring Tom Hardy in not one but two roles, Legend still ends up falling incredibly short of whatever it was trying to accomplish for the story about the notorious Kray twins & their organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1950s & 1960s which its writer-director attempts to bring to life on the film canvas is absolutely devoid of any sort of escalation.Legend chronicles the rise & fall of the Kray twins, two of Britain's most infamous gangsters who rose to power by controlling a larger part of London's criminal underground. The plot is more focused on Reggie's life and follows his journey, covering the start of Kray empire, his stint with love, and the blood bond that keeps the twins together despite their differing modus operandi.Written & directed by Brian Helgeland, Legend begins on an promising note but very soon, all that promise goes out of the window as the story just keeps going around in circles. The entire movie is, more or less, one flimsy moment after another and stays on the same level throughout its runtime and even Helgeland's efforts to bring conflict into the story fails to leave any lasting impression.Coming to the performances, Tom Hardy steers the film past its finish line despite it running out of fuel before the halfway mark and does a good job in his dual role of Reggie & Ronnie Kray, the former being a levelheaded, calculative & charming Kray of the two while the latter is a violence-oriented psychopath. Plus, Hardy gets fine support from Emily Browning & David Thewlis who play Reggie's love interest & Krays' business manager, respectively.On an overall scale, Legend had all the ingredients & a capable cast to succeed as one thrilling crime drama but thanks to improper execution of its plot & its failure to dig deeper into the moments that had little glimpses of greatness, it finishes as a bland, flavourless & highly mediocre movie that left me quite unaffected in the end.

The Little Mermaid," The Fairy Tale That Commenced Disney's Renaissance Era.
","The fairy-tale which began Disney's Renaissance Era must have been a classic flick of its time but looking back now, The Little Mermaid doesn't feel as impressive as it did years ago. The story is a typical fairy tale, this time set in the ocean & concerning a young mermaid who falls in love at first sight with a human prince on board a ship & aspires to become human so that she can spend her life with him. The sea witch offers to fulfill her wish but it's part of her big evil plan to become the new ruler.The 2D animation still looks fantastic & makes striking use of colours in portraying the underwater world of Atlantica. The now memorable characters of Ariel, Sebastian, Ursula & others are wonderfully drawn & rendered on the screen, the story is a let down to be honest & there is nothing special about it. Same goes for the music in my case & the only song I liked is the beautifully composed & magnificently executed 'Under the Sea' track.On an overall scale, The Little Mermaid will always be remembered for it marked the beginning of a new era that took Disney to new creative heights & commercial success and also resurrected some of the elements this studio had given up long ago.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Poetic Narrative Completely Destroyed By Its Overblown Action
","Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an aesthetic, artistic & fascinating blend of intimate melodrama & stylised action that's notable for bringing international fame to the now-esteemed filmmaker, Ang Lee, and is also considered amongst the most influential & popular films to come out from the Chinese film industry.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is set in a distant time in China and follows a gifted swordsman who one day decides to retire from his warrior life and plans to gift his treasured sword to an old friend. But when the sword is stolen by a mysterious fugitive, it is up to him to uncover the thief's identity and to retrieve the sword & return it to its rightful owner.Directed by Ang Lee, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon marks his breakthrough in the world cinema and presents the filmmaker in complete control of his craft. The film is shot in truly dazzling locations, unfolds in a poetic manner, and has an aesthetically pleasing aura to it. Cinematography is undeniably beautiful, the background score is mesmerising but Editing is tediously carried out for the pace is slower & runtime is longer than required.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi & Chang Chen with all chipping in with commendable performances. The wuxia martial arts is what caught the attention of most when the film premiered on the silver screen but it is the very reason that destroyed the whole picture for me. I don't have much to complain about other aspects but the wuxia action segments are so exaggerated here that it simply took the seriousness out of the story for me.On an overall scale, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon does score from an artistic standpoint and works best when approached as a fantasy. In my reviews for other martial arts features, I've made no secret of my disdain for this overly-stylised action choreography unless it's marketed as a comedy, so even if my rating may seem a bit harsh to the die-hard fans of this film, it has less to do with the film's quality and more with my inability to appreciate such gems.

Kennedy is arguably the most interesting one, stemming from the subsequent lack of a clear, satisfying & irrefutable explanation for how the machinations of assassinating the United States President was carried out, and what exactly was the motive behind it.JFK is a 3-hour long political thriller that takes all the theories surrounding the case into consideration, looks for the inconsistencies in the Warren Commission, and then concocts a cleverly structured & masterly edited account that steadily grabs hold of the viewers' attention, only gets more gripping as plot progresses, and finally concludes by implanting a reasonable doubt in their minds.",Null,1,1,2 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Labour Of Love That Celebrates All Things Cinema
","What is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? What isn't Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? It is Quentin Tarantino's love letter to the industry that's been his world all his life. It is his genuinely heartfelt tribute to Hollywood's Golden Age that basked in the glamorous, sunny scene of 1960s Los Angeles. It is his tip of the hat to spaghetti westerns that influenced his filmmaking style more than any other genre. It is his longing for the rolling reels & film stocks that's already becoming a relic of the past. It is his attempt to step out of his comfort zone & create something new that feels fresh yet familiar. And it's the final station in his directorial journey that brings him to the moment where he's more than grateful, wishes to give back & expresses his gratitude in ways that only he can.The 9th feature film by Quentin Tarantino is unlike any of his previous films. It presents the auteur in a completely new light yet brims with everything that we associate with his works. Bright, breezy, beguiling, delicious, detailed, delighting, honest, hilarious, heartwarming, vivid, vibrant, vivacious, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a labor of love that celebrates all things cinema. A beautiful & bittersweet ode to the art of crafting a motion picture, and a eulogy to a bygone era & its yesteryear icons that's painted with nostalgic brushes. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt & Margot Robbie shine throughout in what's 2 hours of Hollywood reminiscence and 45 minutes of classic Tarantino doing what classic Tarantino does best. Not his best film to date but it certainly is his grooviest & most joyous.",Null,2,5,13 September 2019
Beasts of No Nation," Powerful. Provocative. Compelling.
","I think the only way Hollywood views Africa is as an entire continent ravaged by nothing but conflict & suffering and Beasts of No Nation is another exemplification of that. That's not to say that the picture isn't impressive by any means for it is definitely a powerful, provocative & compelling piece of work but this movie industry's immoderate fascination with the civil war subject is slowly becoming unhealthy.Set in an unnamed West African country, Beasts of No Nation tells the story of a young boy named Agu who, after witnessing his family being gunned down by soldiers, flees from the village but inadvertently runs into the rebel forces and is coerced to join them in their fight. The plot then follows Agu's harrowing journey as a child soldier plus the loss of innocence he undergoes after witnessing the brutality & hardships of war.Written, shot & directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, Beasts of No Nation takes a very no-holds- barred approach to bring its script to life on the film canvas and is able to depict everything in an uncompromising manner. The camera brilliantly illustrates the transition our character undergoes from living in a bright, hopeful environment to a grim, disturbing one through its changing colour tones as the plot progresses, and it is effectively utilised by Fukunaga.The plot remains gripping for the most part, thanks to tight editing, but the final act is more like a stretch and its runtime is slightly felt at that point. Coming to the performances, there are two standouts in Abraham Attah & Idris Elba, the former's input being a definite highlight for Attah carries the whole film on his own little shoulders, while Elba plays the leader of the rebels with comfort and the scenes between the two form the core ingredient that keeps the film glued together.On an overall scale, Beasts of No Nation is difficult to watch at times, is unflinching with its violent content, and is meant to be an upsetting experience. But where the movie really hits the mark is in handling the complexities of its lead character and apart from that, there isn't really much in the story that separates it from other Hollywood treatments of same subject matter and while these movies do bring certain issues to light, their exclusive focus on this one particular problem is also hurting an entire continent's image.",Null,3,5,9 December 2015
Gone Girl," David Fincher's Success Streak Continues...
","In a career spanning just over a couple of decades, David Fincher has garnered a very strong reputation as one of the finest auteurs working in the film industry today & certainly the best one around when it comes to thrillers. One can always expect Fincher to come up with a story that's at the forefront of quality, be it the narrative, performances, visual n sound design or entertainment & so far, this master storyteller is yet to disappoint.And his success streak continues with Gone Girl for his latest is a fascinating exploration of the dynamics of marriage, a ruthless exposition of media sensationalism & a biting examination of our morbid curiosity plus attraction to the scenes of tragedy. The story concerns a guy whose life is turned upside down when his wife's sudden disappearance becomes the focus of an intense media circus which turns on him when he's suspected of her possible murder.Directed by David Fincher, Gone Girl is a thrilling piece of work from start to finish for the plot is structured in a manner that keeps the viewers guessing, technical aspects leave nothing to complain about & even its twists n turns occur at just the right moments, which makes the experience more enriching. Also, as pure an exercise it is in suspense, this story is tailor-made for Fincher's talents & he does an excellent job with the material provided, yet again.The screenplay is penned down by Gillian Flynn herself; the author of the book, & it's quite an impressive work from the first time screenwriter. Cinematography has always remained perfectly in tone with the story in every Fincher film & Gone Girl is no exception. Thanks to tight editing, its 150 minutes of runtime is never felt, and the score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross wonderfully captures the essence of the story being told & seamlessly integrates with the unfolding events.Coming to the performances, leading from the front are Ben Affleck & Rosamund Pike in their given roles, especially Pike who steals every scene she's in, commands the screen with sublime finesse, exhibits complete control over her character & her chemistry with Affleck simply works. Neil Patrick Harris, Carrie Coon & Kim Dickens deliver strong performances too but my favourite from the supporting cast is Tyler Perry who plays his character with remarkable confidence.The film is a thought-provoking look at the hardships of matrimony, shows that it takes more than love to make a marriage work, and that the fall in economy can play as devastating a role as lies, dishonesty & infidelity in triggering the downfall of long-term relationships. But where its hammer falls hardest is in its unforgiving representation of the devious nature of media & in the process, it also ends up making a statement about our very own obsession with such materials.On an overall scale, Gone Girl is an incredibly smart, highly sophisticated & immensely satisfying thriller from David Fincher which exquisitely balances the director's artistic ambitions with audience's expected entertainment, thus offering a cinema that delivers on all fronts. Brilliantly directed, deftly written, beautifully photographed, smoothly edited & effectively scored, Gone Girl is definitely amongst the best films of the year & comes strongly recommended.",Null,1,6,16 January 2015
Django Unchained," A Downright Enjoyable, Unabashedly Entertaining & Immensely Satisfying Extravaganza
","The seventh film by Quentin Tarantino is a downright enjoyable, unabashedly entertaining & immensely satisfying extravaganza that finds the reputed filmmaker homaging the classic spaghetti westerns in his own stylized fashion while also toying with America's horrible past with slavery in an amusing but counterattacking manner to deliver a pulp masterpiece that's brutal, bloody & hilarious as hell from start to finish and is destined to please not only Tarantino's aficionados but majority of the filmgoing audience.Set a couple of years before the outbreak of the American Civil War, the story of Django Unchained follows a German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz who buys a slave named Django & promises to give him his freedom in exchange for his assistance in tracking down a trio of outlaws. But after learning of Django's past & his long-lost wife Broomhilda, Schultz offers another deal to him, makes him his partner in the bounty hunting business, and subsequently heads to the plantation with a ridiculous plan to free Django's wife from her cruel owner Calvin Candie.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, each frame of Django Unchained brims with his patented ingredients and is an ideal blend of all his trademarks. Passionately written & enthusiastically directed, the story packs in a remarkable set of characters, all of whom are brilliantly illustrated on the film canvas by its talented cast, and also celebrates his infamous lust for exaggerated blood- filled violence & spectacular wordplay, all illustrated on screen in bold, brazen & blatant style. There are several homages & parodies to be found here, but that KKK mockery is a standout in itself.Production design team does a marvellous job with its time-specific set pieces to recreate the 1850s ambiance, the wisely chosen shooting locations bring a credibility of its own while costume design department takes its inspirations from earlier examples of its genre with few fancy elements later added to it. Cinematography makes excellent use of the warm colour palette and employs several techniques such as long takes, clever angles, fluid camera movements, low-light photography & apt lighting to give those sequences a versatile look & feel while retaining the sharpness & clarity of those images.Its 165 minutes of narrative may seem daunting at first but its runtime is never felt for the most part. The film begins with a terrific sequence that introduces the two key characters and from there on, it moves forward with a rock-n-roll vibe that keeps getting better. The dialogues carry a playful tone, the humour is pure Tarantino and the stylized gun violence is delightfully engaging. The soundtrack makes heavy use of existing spaghetti western tracks (notably the ones from Ennio Morricone & Luis Bacalov) in addition to a few original compositions, all of which sync seamlessly with the accompanying scenes, as is the case in every Tarantino flick.Coming to the acting department, Django Unchained features an outstanding cast in Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington & Samuel L. Jackson, and all of them are just fabulous in their given roles. Foxx plays Django and his performance only gets better as the plot progresses. Waltz effortlessly steals the show with a compelling & charismatic rendition of Dr. King Schultz. DiCaprio plays the antagonist for a change and he's absolutely thrilling & devilishly charming in the role of the sadistic Calvin Candie. Washington does well with what she's given and then there's Jackson who never fails to leave his own mark and here, he's just as great as the rest.On an overall scale, Django Unchained is an absolute riot from beginning to end that showcases the best of Quentin Tarantino in the most direct manner as possible. Excessively stylish yet extremely sophisticated in all departments of filmmaking, this spaghetti western exhibits an incredible sense of fun throughout its runtime despite its provocative subject matter and delivers a roller-coaster ride that stays true to its genre's staples at all times. Possibly the best film of its year & definitely one of the finest in Tarantino's filmography, Django Unchained is an instant classic that makes ingenious use of all its resources to put on screen a cinema that's perfectly balanced in all aspects & winning on all levels. One hundred percent recommended.",Null,1,4,16 January 2016

Aladdin," Another Disney Live-Action Adaptation. Another Downright Terrible Remake.
","Since I've already jumped into this sea of Disney's unnecessary & unwarranted live-action adaptations of their beloved animation masterpieces, might as well check out a couple more of their insipid attempts before calling it quits. Next up in the line was Aladdin. My expectations were even lower. And it still managed to fare worse on all accounts.With its posters, previews & entire marketing screaming nothing but a parody, it's suffice to say that even the x-rated adaptation would've delivered better feels than what this awful remake had to offer. Devoid of all the great bits that made the 1992 original one of the best examples of its kind, Aladdin continues Disney's new-found mantra of denting their own legacy.Co-written & directed by Guy Ritchie, the film looks awful on the outside & is hollow from within. The characters are never convincing in their respective roles. VFX is all over the place, impressive on rare counts, terrible on other occasions. Actors aren't any good, for they all chip in with bad inputs, including Will Smith who takes the role of Genie yet acts like he's playing Will Smith.What it rehashes from the original looks n feels vastly inferior to the original. What it modifies or adds to the plot & characters ruins it even further. The musical numbers have the visual spectacle to some extent but not the heart & charm that made them mesmerising in the animated medium. Ritchie's direction is mediocre, performances are off-putting, and the entire cast is pretty much a miscast.A ghastly blend of weak direction, poor writing, unfunny wit, substandard production values, muddled editing, laughable characterisation & dull performances that never for once realises that the real strength of the 1992 animated musical fantasy lied in its simplicity. Filled to the brim with nothing but shortcomings, this latest adaptation of Aladdin doesn't hold a candle to its animated source, and is forgettable in every sense of the word.",Null,2,4,24 October 2019
Insidious," Promising First-Half. Disastrous Second-Half.
","From the director of Saw & The Conjuring, Insidious had the potential to become one of the most brilliant & genuinely frightening horror films of the 21st century but despite having all the ingredients which are used to near-perfection in the first half, the movie ends up being a huge letdown thanks to the tumble it takes down the road during the following half.The story concerns the Lambert family who have moved to their new house with their two sons but soon start experiencing mysterious incidents in the house. Things turn for the worse when their 8-year old son inexplicably falls into coma and when the doctors are unable to revive him, the parents turn to a spiritualist who warns them of the danger their son is in as a demon plans to take possession of his comatose body.Directed by James Wan, the manner in which he sets up the premise & builds up the tension in the first half with expert use of controlled camera movements, sound effects & silence is worthy of praise but after that, Wan simply loses his grip on everything as the promising & brilliantly executed first act is completely destroyed by its ridiculous second act, thus turning an effective horror into a plainly stupid one.The performances are quite good, camera-work & editing works in perfect harmony for a while, the background score gels pretty well with the events, sound effects is one of its biggest strength and James Wan proves his knowledge when it comes to scaring the audience yet the high standards this film set before the halfway mark is never matched or even challenged by its next half, thus resulting in an overall frustrating experience.Opening with a promise of greater things to come, developing its suspenseful & dreary atmosphere with precision craftsmanship and yet missing what was up for grabs by failing to capitalize on the boost provided by its first half, Insidious really had a chance at cinematic greatness but one wrong route around the halfway mark ultimately ended up wasting that opportunity for good. A heartbreaking disappointment.",Null,0,1,18 September 2013
The Theory of Everything," Go In With Right Expectations & You Won't Be Disappointed.
","One really needs to set their expectations right before diving into this so-called biopic of Stephen Hawking because The Theory of Everything isn't really an exploration of the various breakthroughs Hawking made throughout his career but is mainly about his relationship with his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. Remember that it is adapted from Jane's memoir & is told from her perspective, not Stephen's.The Theory of Everything tells the life story of Jane & Stephen Hawking who meet for the first time at a party in 1963 & there's an instant spark between the two. Their relationship blossoms but tragedy occurs when Hawking learns that he has motor neurone disease. Devastated by this diagnosis, he loses all hope but Jane gives him a reason to live for. The two eventually marry but Hawking's deteriorating health keeps testing their relationship.Directed by James Marsh, The Theory of Everything is a work of incredible warmth & affection as Marsh does a superb job with the given script & is painfully honest with its content. The script sidelines everything to focus entirely on the relationship dynamics. Cinematography provides a glossy layer to the whole picture, Editing keeps the narrative quite engaging for the majority of its runtime, and Jóhann Jóhannsson's score is very intimate, beautiful & heartwarming.Coming to the performances, Eddie Redmayne's illustration of the renowned theoretical physicist is extraordinary for the young actor is completely immersed in his physically challenging role & nails Hawking's mannerisms with breathtaking precision while Felicity Jones is equally committed in her role of Jane Wilde Hawking & her emotionally resonant performance is as impressive a highlight as Redmayne's jaw-dropping work. And its supporting cast does a fine job as well.Sure it feels a bit manipulative on certain instances, sure it conforms to the conventional cliché that behind every successful man lies a great woman, sure it travels a route that doesn't involve much risks or bold decisions & sure it concludes on a rather lackluster note but the on-screen chemistry between Eddie Redmayne & Felicity Jones plus their performance is so magical, convincing & full of charm that it ultimately ends up brushing away most complaints.On an overall scale, The Theory of Everything may not be the Stephen Hawking biopic many might have been looking forward to but it nonetheless works as an awe-inspiring love story that offers an insightful peek into the personal life of an unusual couple. An endearing & entertaining piece of filmmaking that's technically polished & works magnificently on the strength of its two leads, The Theory of Everything is a delightful cinematic experience.",Null,0,0,11 February 2015
Frozen," Frozen Is Disney's Extravagant Celebration & Embracement Of Its Own Legacy
","Packed with singalong songs, eye-popping visuals & presenting a wonderful story of sisterhood, Frozen is another worthy animation out of Disney canon & presents this legendary animation studio doing what it does better than anyone else; a fairy-tale musical. The film tells the story of Anna, an optimistic, cheerful & lively princess who sets off on a journey along with a rugged mountain man, his reindeer pet & a wicked snowman to find & bring back her estranged sister, Elsa, whose magical powers, which she has never been able to control, have brought her entire kingdom under an eternal winter spell.Even though there are minor moments of silliness in the story where it felt like the film is trying too hard to be funny, the story & script still manage to deliver for the most part. It features a dynamic set of characters & relationships we can invest our emotions in, is brilliantly voiced by its cast, boasts a wonderful score accompanied by even more amazing songs and is enveloped with an astonishing beauty thanks to its dazzling visuals. Overall, Frozen is arguably the best animated film of the year, one of the best animated musicals to come out in a long time & marks a third consecutive year when Disney has outclassed Pixar.

2012," If Mankind Can Survive This Turd, It Can Survive Anything!
","From the director of Independence Day, Godzilla & The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 features all the ingredients that one may find in a Roland Emmerich movie; be it the total disregard for science or logic, his obsession with the destruction of the world, nonsensical storyline, annoying characters, near-fatal overdose of visual effects & countless facepalm moments.Inspired from the 2012 phenomenon that made a bunch of retards actually believe that the world is all set for an imminent apocalypse near the end of the mentioned year, the story of 2012 follows a science-fiction writer who struggles to keep his family safe when a series of global catastrophes threaten the fate of mankind, and covers his attempts to bring his kin to refuge.Co-written & directed by Roland Emmerich, 2012 is another addition in the long list of brainless blockbusters that he's churned out throughout his filmmaking career. And although most of his works do rank amongst the worst movies ever made, there are still a few that are fun to watch, like Independence Day. However, 2012 simply sets a new benchmark for how dull & stupid a movie can actually get.The set pieces are grand & digital, and their destruction is what this film relies on to entice its audience. The plot is illogical yet highly predictable, the script sucks and the dialogues are eye-rollingly cheesy, Camera is busy capturing every cataclysmic event this movie has in store, Editing is virtually absent for its 158 minutes of runtime actually feels like eternity. And its background score is loud & irritating for the most part.The visual effects are all over the place for it's quite impressive in a few sequences but look totally cartoonish in other effects-laden segments. Almost every natural disaster make its way into the final print, and is so much exaggerated that it looks real funny & is eventually made all the more hilarious by the characters caught up in that situation. Coming to the performances, everyone attempts career suicide here but few still manage to survive.On an overall scale, 2012 is by every means an insult to human intelligence. There's no fun to be had here unlike a few earlier works in Emmerich's filmography and just being able to sit through this turd of a cinema should be considered an achievement in itself. Guaranteed a place amongst the worst things anyone has ever made, 2012 effectively captures the indomitable will of human spirit to survive against all odds for if one can sit through this torture, then one is definitely capable of surviving an apocalypse!

X-Men: The Last Stand," The Weakest Film of the Original X-Men Trilogy
","The third chapter of the original X-Men trilogy is a major step-down compared to the fluidity, complexity & kinetic energy of the previous two films (which were helmed by director Bryan Singer) and thus results as the weakest installment of the X-Men franchise. Still, not everything is bad about X-Men: The Last Stand as it sure has its moments but it never comes close to providing a cinematic experience that lingers after the movie ends.X-Men: The Last Stand introduces more characters of the X-Men Universe & merges two story lines; one concerning Jean Grey who presumably died in the last chapter only to resurrect here as the most powerful mutant the world has ever known, and the other plot line concerns the creation of what is being called the permanent cure for the mutation process which Magneto uses as an excuse to urge the fellow mutants to wage a war against mankind.Brett Ratner clearly misses what made the previous films succeed as he just doesn't give his characters time to breathe & is all about blowing things up. The writing also is very inferior compared to its predecessors. The visual effects must have been impressive at its time but it sure looks badly aged now. Performances aren't a letdown but there's nothing impressive about it either. And it surely makes some bold decisions early in the film which ended up backfiring.However, if there is one thing to admire in this film then it would be its theme that's more explicit compared to the subtlety of the previous chapters. Seeing mutation as a disease & forcing a permanent cure to it very much symbolizes the way the world views the LGBT community or anyone who doesn't fit the society's description of normal but on an overall scale, X-Men: The Last Stand isn't even close to what was really expected from it. Still, worth a watch... at least once.",Null,0,1,12 May 2014
The Lives of Others," A Masterwork Of Pristine Quality That Deserves A Broader Audience!
","Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, The Lives of Others has a very serene ambiance when compared to other entries in the spy genre which are usually filled with chases, action or violence for this German drama tries to paint an authentic portrait of life in East Germany and is a silent observation of human nature.Set in 1980s East Germany, the story of The Lives of Others (also known as Das Leben der Anderen) focuses on the monitoring of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi; the secret police, and concerns an agent who's tasked to conduct a surveillance on a writer & his lover, but over the course of his duty ends up becoming too infatuated with their lives.Written & directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, The Lives of Others is crafted in an incredibly calm n composed manner, and presents the filmmaker in firm grip of the story he attempts to bring to life on the film canvas, which sounds even more astonishing when noted that it is his directional debut. And the proper execution of other aspects only work out in its favour.Set pieces & locations do evoke an authentic-looking atmosphere of East Germany. The camera-work is carefully employed as the movements are static for the most part, use of lighting & colour tones is skilfully done, and the drama is captured in fine detail. Editing unfolds its 137 minutes of runtime at a very relaxed pace, and the performances by its entire cast is simply outstanding.On an overall scale, The Lives of Others is an engaging drama that manages to create & sustain its tension amazingly well, gets better as the plot progresses, and concludes its tale in a very satisfying manner. The script is definitely its biggest strength and rest of the stuff is wonderfully handled too but its glacial pace & quietness did bother me at times.

Good Will Hunting," A Touching, Inspiring & Emotionally Dense Drama Steered By Stellar Performances From Robin Williams & Matt Damon
","Winner of two Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay, Good Will Hunting is written by two of the biggest stars working in Hollywood industry today and is an emotionally dense drama that manages to as inspiring as it is touching and is further uplifted by stellar performances from both Matt Damon & Robin Williams.Good Will Hunting tells the story of a young man who works as a janitor at MIT and happens to be remarkably gifted at mathematics. When his talent is discovered by the professor whose advanced problems he's been solving anonymously, he takes him under his wing and also arranges a therapy session for the troubled man that changes his life.Scripted by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck, and brought to life on the film canvas by Gus Van Sant, the film follows a predictable route and is consistently paced throughout its runtime but it's the sum of the parts than the whole package that makes it an engaging ride. Few moments brim with powerful emotions while it falls flat on other occasions but it does enough to steer itself past the finish line.The technical aspects are finely executed, Danny Elfman's score is truly mesmerising but Good Will Hunting excels most in the acting department. The cast comprises of Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgård, Ben Affleck & Minnie Driver, with Damon & Williams impressing the most. Their individual performances are no doubt strong but it's their excellent chemistry with each other that turns out to be this film's highlight.On an overall scale, Good Will Hunting is a wonderfully crafted journey about a troubled young man who learns to confront his past & move towards a more promising future and also paints a heartfelt portrait of an unlikely friendship that develops between two unexpected individuals. The story is at its best when the screen is shared by a therapist who approaches his patients in a grounded manner and his latest client who's unwilling to open up to anyone.

Room," A Beautiful Ode To The Love Between A Mother & Her Child
","A cleverly envisioned concept realised on the film canvas in a controlled but highly effective manner, Room is an ingeniously crafted, expertly narrated & superbly performed thriller that packs in a much darker story than expected, works as a beautiful ode to the bond between a mother & her child, and benefits immensely from Brie Larson's compelling performance.Room tells the story of a young mother & her 5-year old boy who live in a dilapidated room where she has fabricated a safe & happy universe for her kid in order to shield him from the gruesome reality of their current situation. But after sensing that he is now much capable of understanding things, she concocts a risky plan to escape from the confinement and return to a world her son is totally unaware of.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by the author of the book this movie is adapted from, Room begins on a calm note that takes us through how this mother & son spend their daily life in the small room they live in while steadily bringing a sense of curiosity about their surroundings, which turns absolutely traumatic once their predicament is revealed. The plot is divided into two parts and both cover their isolation in different confinements.The first half is fabulously constructed, with production design team doing a commendable job in congesting the enclosed room with all the necessities that finds its use in the finished print. Cinematography encapsulates the whole picture with an overcast ambiance that aptly reflects the harrowing experience our leading lady has been through. Editing could've been improved for sequences in the second half become repetitive at times. And the background score makes its presence felt only when required.Coming to the performances, Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay spearhead this aspect with an impressive input and share a spot-on chemistry with each other. Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers & William H. Macy do well in their supporting roles but it's Larson & Tremblay who carry this film all the way for the former delivers what's arguably her finest performance to date while the latter manages to be less irritating & more adorable as the story progresses. Plus, their bonding as mother & child is believable, heartfelt & mesmerising.However, the most striking thing about Room is the way it deals with the themes of isolation freedom & love. For the majority of its first half, we see only two people who are completely dependent on each other, haven't had the exposure of the outside world in years, and share an amazing bond despite the nearly hopeless situation they are in. The next half focuses on their difficulty in readjusting to the real world, as the mother finds herself equally isolated in the outer environment while her son is trying to grasp the unfamiliar world around him.On an overall scale, Room is a beautiful, riveting & heartbreaking story that keeps its main focus on the relationship between a mother & her child, and even in the darkest of situation it doesn't discard the elements of love & hope. The first act brilliantly paves way for what's next in store, the middle act capitalises on the solid groundwork and is simply perfect for it brims with just the right amount of tension & uncertainty, while its remaining runtime feels a bit stretched & becomes repetitive before finally concluding on a hopeful note. Rewarding in more ways than one, Room is one survival tale that's worthy of your time. Don't miss it.",Null,1,8,18 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A New Power Is Rising. Its Victory Is At Helm.
","Every film consists of three acts; The first is where you introduce your story & its characters. The second is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. And the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends to bring your entire tale to its conclusion. Almost everyone has a definite idea of how to begin & end their stories but the middle act is always the most difficult. Because no matter how great the other two acts are, if this part isn't handled well, then the overall experience ultimately amount to nothing in the end.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga & just like the novel, it has no definite beginning or ending. What's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple story lines & all need to work. And the good news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel as faithfully as its predecessor did, it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that improves upon the original.Picking the story right from where it was left off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship & intercuts three story lines. The first concerns Frodo & Sam who, on their journey to Mordor, find their peril deepen for there is another who hunts the ring. The second deals with Merry & Pippin, who were taken as hostages in the last film. And the third covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli who, along with an unexpected ally, head to Rohan to warn them of an impending war. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad- dûr, fortress of the dark lord, Sauron, & Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but director Peter Jackson manages to do it once again & what's even more admirable is that he gives equal importance & value to all three story lines as the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers & the decision to conclude it at a different event from the novel sets a perfect stage for the finale. Also, it is extremely well written & narrated for enough time is given to develop its new characters, without ever interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast.Coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress with its meticulously detailed sets & is ideally fused with the gorgeously photographed landscapes of New Zealand. Camera-work is at its absolute best during the action sequences, Make-up, Costume Design & Sound retain their qualities and Editing trims it down to 179 minutes but just like the last time, I recommend the extended edition for it adds 45 minutes of new footages which further enriches its overall experience.Weta Digital's VFX team made history with The Fellowship of the Ring but the enhancements it brings in The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum & Treebeard are entirely CGI & it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Howard Shore's magnificent score continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure & is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor.As far as the performances go, The Two Towers adds even more strength to its ensemble cast as the reprising actors once again chips in with faithful performances while the new ones instantly make their mark felt. But the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum/Sméagol. Heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & jaw-dropping performance that it's easily the finest acting of the saga, so far.On an overall scale, The Two Towers is a smooth continuation & a worthy expansion of the world that was brought alive in The Fellowship of the Ring. There are a few artistic license taken but it all stays within the realms of Tolkien's world & remains true to its spirits. Succeeding as another spellbinding & engrossing masterpiece that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering epic, The Two Towers is an immensely satisfying sequel that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor & signs off by setting an even higher bar for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium.

Schindler's List," Whoever Saves One Life, Saves the World Entire.
","One of the most essential, powerfully moving & profoundly affecting films to grace the silver screen, Schindler's List is the crowning achievement of Steven Spielberg's remarkable film career that finds the master storyteller at the pinnacle of his artistry, is crafted with extreme care n dedication, and is rightfully acknowledged as one of the most honoured & significant films of all time.There are many films out there that have dealt with the subject of Holocaust in the past but the level of precision, craftsmanship & commitment that Spielberg brings on the screen this time plus the emotional impact this film provides over the course of its runtime is second to none. And even after two decades, Schindler's List remains his most personal, most mature & most accomplished work to date.",Null,30,52,6 January 2010
The Lion King," An Atrociously Abhorrent Abomination
","An atrociously abhorrent abomination that butchers every little thing that was great about Disney's crowning achievement, this photorealistic remake of The Lion King ranks amongst the worst crimes ever committed on film canvas. Brought to life by the studio whose greed knows no bounds, this unnecessary & unwarranted turd is the latest in Disney's new-found formula for making billions dollars more by simply cashing in on viewers' nostalgia. And if its box-office gross is any indication, it won't be the last.Devoid of heart, soul & creativity that made the original an undisputed masterpiece for all ages, this repugnant reiteration is a vomit-inducing version that sure looks pretty on the surface but is empty from within right down to the bottom. Had they superimposed the original audio recordings over its so-called realistic visuals, the result would still be a bit better than what the new voices, new scenes, new songs & new characters add to the final print. Everything feels off & out of sync about this one. Not a single thing clicks.Now I've got nothing but appreciation for the hardworking visual effects artists, for they just did what they were paid to do. And they did an excellent job at it. But the filmmakers' decision to realistically portray the animals also strips these characters of all the heartfelt emotions & genuine expressions they illustrated so vibrantly in the original. Nothing that happens in this story evokes our feelings or tugs our heart, not even THAT scene. Even the carefree duo of Timon & Pumba come off as annoying & insufferable this time. Also, several dialogues are similar and yet they don't deliver the same impact.Despite the longer runtime, there is a rushed feeling to it. The original characters exhibit no personality while new ones bring nothing fresh to the table. All its attempts at humour fall flat. The modifications in the music & songs department further ruin the viewing experience. And that Spirit song is so misplaced that it's actually facepalm-inducing. All in all, where the original basked in the rich imagery, limitless creativity, magical flair & pure escapism that the medium of animation provides, this visually striking yet emotionally bland & imaginatively bankrupt retelling offers a cinematic ride that can only be summed up as unforgivably cringeworthy.",Null,3,6,18 October 2019
The Incredibles," The Incredibles is Incredible On All Levels.
","After exploring the world of toys, bugs, monsters & ocean life in an extremely unusual yet intimately human manner, Pixar Animation Studios brings its sweeping cinematic vision to the world of superheroes, this time showing the highs n lows of life from their point of view. And just like their previous ventures, The Incredibles continues Pixar's dream run of all-round success & is one of the greatest films about superheroes.The Incredibles tells the story of a family of superheroes, with each member having unique set of superpowers. Forced into retirement to a civilian life due to the number of lawsuits resulting from the damages caused by their crime-fighting activities, Mr. Incredible's wish to relive the glory days is granted when he's asked for assistance on a secret mission but it ultimately thrusts his entire family into action to save the world from an imminent threat.Written & directed by Brad Bird, The Incredibles is his sophomore effort after The Iron Giant & also marks his first stint at Pixar. And while the script is superbly written plus wonderfully balances its moments of action, drama, comedy, adventure & spectacle, it's the computer animation here that breaks all barriers of its time to realise Bird's vision on the film canvas in a full-fledged manner, which also makes it Pixar's most challenging work until that point.Coming to the technical aspects, The Incredibles leaves its mark in all departments. The 3D rendering of every frame is polished to an extensive level of detail. Cinematography makes energetic use of camera, firm exhibition of colour palette plus also benefits from accurate lighting. Editing is at its absolute best during the action sequences, most of which are jaw- dropping to look at, but there are also a few moments where the pacing is a bit on a slower side.Add to that, characters inhabiting the picture are brilliantly envisioned, sketched & rendered plus the relentless refinement in screenplay nicely takes care of the character development part. Pixar again puts up a rich voice cast, all of whom ably fill in their respective roles. The themes of mid-life crisis, job dissatisfaction, marriage troubles etc are elegantly handled as well. And Michael Giacchino chips in with a fantastic score that beautifully intertwines with the events of this action-adventure.On an overall scale, The Incredibles is Pixar's most action-packed film to date that sets a new benchmark for computer animation by stretching it beyond its limitations. Full of creative energy, highly gripping plot, intriguing characters, spellbinding action, groundbreaking animation, vibrant photography, tight editing & sensational score, all pushed to extreme under Brad Bird's kinetic direction, this instant classic triumphs as one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying films to come out of Pixar's cannon. Living up to its name & working on all levels, The Incredibles is blockbuster filmmaking at its most incredible.",Null,0,0,7 October 2013
The Mist," Monsters Come In Many Forms
","From the director of The Shawshank Redemption & The Green Mile comes another adaptation of a Stephen King's novel, this time exploring the horrors that people are capable of inflicting on others when their primal instincts are driven by the fear of the unknown. Engulfed in a thick layer of mist, what we have here is a monster flick that's thrilling, suspenseful & looming with paranoia and also works as an apt examination of human condition.The Mist concerns a small town community that gathers at the local supermarket to pick supplies, following a night of violent thunderstorm, but when their entire town is enveloped by an unnatural mist that's apparently hiding otherworldly creatures, they find themselves stuck at the store for an indefinite period and attempt to survive the apocalyptic disaster together. But tension soon arises within the horrified & distraught members of the community.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, The Mist doesn't take long to move on with its main plot as within minutes into the story, we find the entire town being enveloped in a thick mist which brings an aura of mystery along with the monsters and instantly establishes a suspenseful atmosphere as well. However, Darabont's real strength lies in exploring our basic instincts and he demonstrates exactly that with alarming trueness while handling the genre conventions side by side.The film packs an adequate amount of monster action but it is at its most effective when dealing with the distinct personalities that inhabit this feature. A chilling sense of dread permeates each n every frame, and it remains a tense affair till the very end, where it culminates on a far darker note than anticipated. Sure, it doesn't shy away from revelling in little bloodshed & gore every now n then but its main emphasis is on keeping its foreboding ambiance alive, at which it brilliantly triumphs.The majority of its plot unfolds in a single location, bringing the claustrophobia element into play, while creatures of all shapes & sizes keep surfacing at regular intervals to remind us of the peril that's waiting outside. Also contributing to the overall experience is its steady camera-work, firm editing & its nearly absent soundtrack that makes its presence felt only during the final moments, thus enhancing the jolt of its climax by a further few notches. But there are also a few misses.The visual effects is terrible when it comes to monsters' designs & appearance. It looks a tad too cartoonish to be taken seriously, and never seamlessly blends with the imagery. However, it does work when all we could see is their silhouettes. Performances aren't that compelling either as the cast fails to capitalise on the terrific work Darabont has done with the scripted characters. Their input isn't disappointing nor does it take away anything from the picture but it could've been so much more.On an overall scale, The Mist is another expertly crafted, smartly narrated & thoroughly engrossing cinema from Frank Darabont that may not touch the heights of his finest efforts but it still works as an interesting meditation on human nature. Beautifully illustrating just how quickly rational thinking goes out the window when people are placed in overwhelming situations, and how easily fear & panic can turn even the most civilised society into a mindless mob, The Mist is dense with themes, focuses more on the evil that resides within us, and cuts deeper than your average monster flick. Worth a shot.",Null,0,1,27 August 2016
The Elephant Man," I Am Not An Elephant! I Am Not An Animal! I Am A Human Being! I ... Am ... A ... Man!
","Told with remarkable sensitivity, crafted with pristine care & making a hard-hitting statement about human nature in an extremely composed manner, The Elephant Man is an emotionally scarring, soul-shattering & absolutely heartbreaking fable about a heavily disfigured person who's treated as a freak by the society in spite of his friendly, kind-hearted nature.Based on the real-life story of Joseph Merrick, the story of The Elephant Man takes place in 19th century London and follows a surgeon who comes across a severely deformed man at a freak show and requests him to be brought to his hospital for examination and on further interaction finds him to be an intelligent & sociable man and vows to help him in any way & protect him from further exploitation.Directed by David Lynch, The Elephant Man is my first stint with his works and the manner in which he brought it to life is pure craftsmanship. Exhibiting firm control over each aspect, Lynch makes every scene & spoken dialogue relevant to the story with added enhancement coming from its black-n-white photography, detailed set pieces, melancholic score, relaxed pacing and truly impressive performances.Cinematography makes fluid use of its camera with steady movements, sharp focus & well- chosen angles in addition to excellent use of lighting & shadows, while the crisp greyscale encapsulation only adds a sense of timelessness to its narrative. The slow pacing makes it a more immersive experience but it may not go down well with every viewer. And its make- up was so effective that it prompted the Oscar people to create a separate category for this very aspect.Coming to the acting department, every cast member chips in with good work in his or her given role but it's the input from Anthony Hopkins & John Hurt that leaves the most lasting impression. Hurt delivers an immensely poignant, deeply sympathetic & emotionally moving performance as the titular character and is the soul of this picture. Hopkins himself exhibits wide range of emotions in the role of the surgeon who rescues Merrick from the freak show & offers him shelter in his hospital.There is a lot to dig in here for The Elephant Man is a criticism of how society is wired to be repelled or feel disgusted by anything that doesn't fit into their definition of 'normal'. There are several moments in the picture that reflect just how quick we end up making an opinion about someone based solely on their outer appearances, even if they are a whole different person from within, and with this outright rejection, we only contribute to their added misery for these helpless people end up being exploited for their deformities.On an overall scale, The Elephant Man is a plea for us to not be so harsh with our baseless judgments, asks for a little more compassion for people who can't defend themselves since society itself has discarded them, and is an expertly crafted motion picture that shows its filmmaker in complete control of his craft. To see someone so humane be treated in such a harsh brutal manner for something that's not even his fault is troubling on many levels, but it's also going to be an eye-opener for many. Strongly recommended to every viewer out there.",Null,0,0,9 September 2015

The Bourne Legacy," The Bourne Legacy Adds Nothing New To The Legacy of Jason Bourne.
","Lacking the stylistic visual flair, kinetic action, highly charged atmosphere, sense of urgency, hyperactive camera, cut-throat editing & almost everything that made The Bourne Trilogy an intensely entertaining ride of non-stop thrills, The Bourne Legacy is an uninspiring & unnecessary fourth chapter that's quite inferior to its predecessors and doesn't even have Jason Bourne in it.Taking place concurrently with the events of The Bourne Ultimatum, the story of The Bourne Legacy concerns Aaron Cross; an assassin-in-training for CIA who goes on the run for his life after the clandestine exposure of their operations in previous movies forces the secret agency to shut down all active operations & terminate every associated member within it with immediate effect.With Paul Greengrass not returning to direct, it's the screenwriter of The Bourne Trilogy who takes over the directional duties but completely forgets what made the previous films work as Tony Gilroy ends up taking too much time in setting up the premise which took away the spontaneity & urgency for which the Bourne series was known for. Gilroy does show capability as a director but he still has a long way to go.Those who disliked Greengrass' frenetic shooting style in previous films might be able to sit through this one as camera movements are much more relaxed but then its story nevertheless remains a tedious affair & the lazy editing certainly doesn't help the cause. The action sequences are too less, drama is mostly dull & the film kind of overstays its welcome in the end but at least the climactic action sequence was cool, even if short-lived.Coming to the performances, the cast mainly comprises of Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton with Renner playing Aaron Cross, at which he turned out to be quite brilliant. Both Weisz & Norton are certainly capable of delivering better performances than their contribution in this film. And to be honest, Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is severely missed in this one and only after watching this film can one estimate just how important Damon is to this franchise.On an overall scale, The Bourne Legacy marks a massive drop in quality when compared to previous films and even though it doesn't add anything to the legacy of Jason Bourne, it fortunately doesn't end up tarnishing it too. Slow, convoluted & underwhelming, The Bourne Legacy is certainly not a sequel that fans of The Bourn Trilogy deserved. Worth skipping if you'd like to.",Null,0,4,19 September 2013
Dog Day Afternoon," A Work Of Quality That Refuses To Age
","Based on a true story, filmed majorly in a single location & riding on the strength of its two sensational performances, Dog Day Afternoon is a firmly crafted, expertly narrated, briskly paced & accurately portrayed cinema that is much more than a robbery gone wrong story for it also tries to capture various issues prevalent in 1970s America with its anti- establishment tone.Set in Brooklyn during the early 70s, Dog Day Afternoon tells the story of a first-time crook who along with his friend decides to rob a bank but their plan goes awry from the very start when they arrive at the bank after the daily cash pickup. However, with the arrival of police, the whole scenario inadvertently turns into a hostage situation which soon escalates into an intense media circus.Fabulously directed by Sidney Lumet, this crime drama is one of the finest works of his filmmaking career & presents him at the very top of his game. The film doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise, introduces tension with fine elegance which is then steadily elevated as the story progresses to finally subside after a nail-biting finale that's far more suspenseful than most thrillers out there.Further intensifying its plot is its claustrophobic atmosphere made possible by its secluded location & tight editing. And last but not the least is the outstanding work by both Al Pacino & John Cazale. Although Pacino expresses his character's dilemma amazingly well, Cazale steals the show with a performance that's as unforgettable as it is heartbreaking. And both of them are nicely supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, whether it's the direction, writing, acting, camera-work, editing or even its set pieces, Dog Day Afternoon is a work of quality in every one of these aspects and is also amongst the best works in the careers of Sidney Lumet, Al Pacino & John Cazale. Belonging to the very decade that gave us some of the greatest American films of all time, Dog Day Afternoon comes thoroughly recommended for it is a classic that simply refuses to age.",Null,0,1,10 March 2015
Cars 2," Pixar's Weakest Film To Date!
","From its debut in 1995 to its most successful film in 2010, Pixar Animation Studios released 11 feature-length films, almost all of which went on to garner them acclaim, love & respect from critics n viewers around the world, completely reinvented the animation industry in the process, and also turned this animation powerhouse into one of world cinema's finest.But everything that has a beginning has an end & there's always a first time for all things. And Cars 2 marks something of a first for Pixar; it's their first critical failure which ultimately marks the end of the winning streak the studio had kept alive since its inception. However, what's even more disappointing is that they actually decided to make a sequel to Cars!Cars 2 follows the story of race car Lightning McQueen & tow truck Mater who together travel to Japan & Europe to take part in the World Grand Prix, arranged by a former oil tycoon to promote his biofuel. But when Mater inadvertently costs McQueen his first race & is asked to leave by him, he ends up finding himself caught in an international espionage.Directed by John Lasseter, Cars 2 takes everything that was wrong with its predecessor & turns it even worse. I don't really know if Disney pushed Pixar for this sequel because of the billions of dollars it earned through Cars' merchandising or if Lasseter truly wanted to return to the picture that barely managed to keep its streak alive. Either way, it definitely isn't Pixar-level cinema.The plot adapts the same clichéd international espionage we're seen many times before & this is coming from the studio that always brought something new to the table. The runtime is much longer than it needs to be, characters in this franchise were never interesting but now, they're annoying too. Its timid attempts at humour falls apart on most occasions. But its computer animation does carry the Pixar trademark.On an overall scale, Cars 2 is an unnecessary sequel that shouldn't have existed in the first place. It might be the best one can come up with when having Mater as the lead character but when the first film already warned that people are not interested in these characters, then making a second chapter was absolutely pointless. All in all, after continuously raising the bar during their rise to the top, Pixar at last comes crashing down with Cars 2 & the fall has been so traumatic that it's yet to fully recover from it.",Null,1,3,14 April 2015

Kick-Ass," A Wild, Rambunctious & Endlessly Fun Extravaganza That's Not To Be Missed
","A thrilling, amusing & refreshing delight, Kick-Ass is an exuberantly violent, unabashedly profane & genuinely hilarious extravaganza that's cleverly crafted, furiously paced & brilliantly performed and isn't just one of the best films of its year but also ranks amongst the better examples of its genre.Kick-Ass tells the story of a high-school loner who aspires to be a real-life superhero and, one day, decides to go ahead with his dream despite having no power, no training & no meaningful reason behind it, and finds unlikely allies in a 'father-daughter duo with an agenda' while fighting crime on his own.Co-written & directed by Matthew Vaughn, Kick-Ass is a wild ride from start to finish. Its premise is ridiculous, its blood-filled action is over-the-top, its profanity level is off the charts, and yet it is difficult to look away from it because it pretty much nails the basic aspects of storytelling & packs an interesting set of characters.The script is no slouch either. The story is compelling from start to finish and sufficient depth is provided to relevant characters, thus allowing the viewers to get on board with their journey. Technical aspects are expertly executed too and play a vital role in uplifting the overall experience by extensively refining its visual design.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Aaron Johnson, Chloë Grace Moretz, Nicholas Cage, Mark Strong & Christopher Mintz Plasse, and all of them deliver fab performances in their respective roles and bring their colorful characters to life with rigor but, in the end, it's Grace Moretz who steals the show, that too with effortless ease.On an overall scale, Kick-Ass is a stylishly directed, deftly written, richly photographed, tightly edited, viciously paced & smartly witted action comedy that's filled with so many pleasant surprises that it ends up delivering much more than what was expected from it. Offering quality entertainment & scoring high on satisfaction meter, it is a thoroughly rambunctious & endlessly fun ride that's worth your time & money.

Call Me by Your Name," Absolutely Baffled By Its Near-Unanimous Praise
","Heading into Call Me By Your Name with high expectations after hearing so many great things about it, I have to admit that I'm quite baffled by the near-unanimous praise it has garnered since its premiere. Tedious, overlong & painfully boring, this coming-of-age romance is one hell of a disappointment.Set in 1980s Italy, the story of Call Me By Your Name follows Elio; a young kid on the cusp of adulthood who's instantly smitten by Oliver, his father's new assistant who will be sending the summer with them. As the two begin spending more time with each other, a beautiful bond blossoms between them.Directed by Luca Guadagnino, this is my first stint with his works and while I do find the simplicity & purity of its tender romance a plus, the lethargic pace at which it all unfolds makes the entire experience a very frustrating sit. Sure it allows more space for the characters to breathe but there's nothing about them that's compelling.Wandering aimlessly for the most part with no sense of direction, it had me wishing for the end around the halfway mark only. The film does find its sure footing during the final act but it takes too long to get there and the interest is already lost by that time. Its soothing camerawork & serene setting do help but even they can't fill the emptiness that lies in between.Performances on the other hand are commendable. The film packs a reliable cast in Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg & others, with Chalamet impressing the most with an emotionally complex input and is at his best during the final frames. Hammer leaves a mark of his own while Stuhlbarg chips in with good support and his final monologue is the only moment that resonated with me.On an overall scale, Call Me By Your Name is a deceptively simple, melancholic & uncontaminated portrait of first love that seems to have won over everyone but left me indifferent for the most part. At least those couple songs by Sufjan Stevens are mesmerising. There's no denying that Timothee Chalamet is a revelation here but if you're not already invested in his character's journey, then Call Me by Your Name is going to be one excruciating cinematic experience.",Null,6,24,17 March 2018
Gran Torino," A Minor Clint Eastwood Film Powered By His Badass Performance
","Packing an old-school toughness beneath its contemporary setting, Gran Torino is another sleek, sound & sophisticated work from Clint Eastwood who this time not only impresses as a director but also leads the show from the front with a sturdy input that towers above all else.The story of Gran Torino follows a recently widowed Korean war veteran who has trouble getting along with everyone. When one of his neighbours tries to steal his car for his initiation into a gang, the grumpy old man sets out to reform him, and ends up doing more than he intended to.Directed by Clint Eastwood (best known for Unforgiven & Million Dollar Baby), the film finds the veteran actor exhibiting no loss in form, and still more than capable of carrying the entire film on his shoulders. His work behind the camera is just as polished though the story doesn't pack a strong emotional punch.Eastwood's old-school attitude & badass charisma is on full display here but it's delightful to watch him play a role he does better than anyone else. Though the rest of the cast play their part rather well, not one of them commands the screen like Eastwood does. As for the present Hmong culture, it is treated with respect.On an overall scale, Gran Torino is a small-scale production of a small-scale story that's skilfully crafted & steadily paced, and finds Eastwood in control of his craft, both in front & behind the camera. The story isn't memorable by any means nor does it deviate from the archetypical white saviour trope but the cinematic ride it offers is interesting, engaging & mostly satisfying.

The Hurt Locker," Absolutely Deserving Of All Its Accolades.
","Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Hurt Locker is a highly gripping, intensely thrilling & bone-chillingly suspenseful war drama that's expertly crafted, masterly composed & skilfully narrated from start to finish and, with its firm grip on the very element of suspense, delivers an experience that's destined to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats throughout its runtime.Set during the Iraq War, the story of The Hurt Locker follows a bomb disposal squad that is assigned a new team leader after their previous boss is killed during one of their operations. The plot covers the relationship between the team members as the two subordinates soon find themselves at odds with the new guy for his maverick ways when it comes to disposing a bomb puts the lives of other officers at risk too.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, The Hurt Locker is arguably the finest work of her filmmaking career for the war atmosphere is brilliantly captured, every aspect is meticulously refined & the way she builds up the tension is worthy of praise. Every single sequence featuring our bomb disposal squad doing their job is nerve-wracking as hell, and while the story can be seen as an accumulation of similar-looking segments, the whole part does have a sensible core.The set pieces & locations do provide an authentic feeling of being present in an unwanted territory where life hangs in the balance all the time. Camera-work is raw & immediate plus its controlled movements contribute immensely in elevating the film's nail-biting tension to an unbearable level. Editing is neatly executed too for its 131 minutes of story effortlessly sustains the suspense introduced within the film's opening moments, however, there are a few static moments in between.Sound design always plays a vital role in war films & it's good to see it getting the attention it deserves here. The soundtrack by Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders beautifully blends into the narrative, and helps greatly in further amplifying the whole experience. The cast features the then-relatively unknown actors in Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie & others, with guest appearances from Guy Pearce & Ralph Fiennes, and there isn't really anything to complain because everyone of them delivers a truly committed performance.Jeremy Renner is a revelation in the role of Sgt. First Class William James; the new head of the bomb disposal squad whose daredevil acts come off as reckless at first but as the film progresses, we slowly understand why he is the way he is. Anthony Mackie also chips in with a strong input as one of the team members, and his friction with Renner is the story's driving force. Guy Pearce & Ralph Fiennes do a commendable job in their guest roles, while the rest of the supporting cast are equally devoted to their given characters.On an overall scale, The Hurt Locker is one of the most thrilling, suspenseful, unpredictable & intense war films to come out in a long time, and despite it having no clear antagonists or even a proper climax, remains a thoroughly engaging cinema from the first frame to the last. One of the best films about Iraq War, one of the finest films of its year, and definitely worthy of all its accolades, The Hurt Locker shows war as not just a primal descent into madness but also as a potent drug, as can be seen in the resolution of the lead character's arc. Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,3 August 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Another Addition To The Franchise That Nobody Gives A Damn About Anymore
","Another unnecessary addition to the franchise that already sailed into the sunset on a satisfactory note a decade ago, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth instalment in the series nobody gives a damn about anymore, tries so hard to be funny that it's actually pitiful, and fails to move an inch off the seabed after On Stranger's Tides sunk it in such spectacular fashion.Set 5 years after the events of the last movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales finds Captain Jack Sparrow being pursued by an undead sea captain & his crew after he unwittingly sets them free. Joined by Henry Turner, an astronomer & an old friend-foe, all on board with agendas of their own, his only hope of survival lies in seeking the trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that would grant him control of the seas.Directed by Joachim Rønning & Espen Sandberg, the film lifts its plot outline from the first entry in the saga yet is devoid of all the elements that turned it into an instant classic right away. Direction is poor as the plot feels repetitive, convoluted & bloated. Writing is just as bad, for the returning characters have got nothing to add while the new characters are more or less hopeless and have no meat on their arcs.A number of scenes pay homage to earlier entries of this series but they don't mean much because just like everything in the movie, it feels forced as if slapped on to the narrative just for the sake of it instead of contributing in any meaningful manner. Despite running at 129 minutes, which makes it the shortest entry in the series, the film feels overlong & bloated, thanks to its lazy editing. And the background score isn't any different this time.Coming to the performances, the returning cast of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush & Kevin McNally, in addition to Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley, reprise their respective roles while new additions include Javier Bardem, Brenton Thwaites & Kaya Scodelario who play Captain Salazar, Henry Turner & Carina Smyth respectively. And yet, there isn't one performance in the picture that stands out or leaves anything remotely resembling a positive impression.Depp's acting career has been on a downward spiral for a while now and even a return to his most iconic role fails to turn things around for him as Jack Sparrow in this instalment is more annoying than amusing. Rush condones to tag along with the circus for another easy check. Bardem is truly wasted in the role of Captain Salazar, while Thwaites & Scodelario are the new Bloom & Knightley in this soft reboot but neither their individual inputs nor their chemistry ever hits the right note.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is an unneeded instalment to the saga that was better off as a trilogy & shouldn't have been disturbed ever since. Incompetently directed, poorly scripted, lazily edited, awfully paced, terribly performed & marking the departure of Hans Zimmer from the franchise as well, there is just about nothing that works out in the film's favour. In the end, it's just as appalling as the previous entry, if not more, and needs to be put out of its misery. Just skip it.",Null,3,6,8 September 2017
The Longest Day," Grand In Scope, Objective In Approach, And Impressive Throughout
","Maintaining a close proximity with the real life landmark event, featuring a massive ensemble, and told on a grand scale, The Longest Day is one of the most ambitious productions of its time that's not only notable for rescuing its studio from bankruptcy but is also one of the rarest examples of its genre that narrates its tale from an objective viewpoint.The Longest Day chronicles the events leading up to the historic Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 during World War II, and tells it from both the Allied & German points of view. Supervised by Darryl F. Zanuck and directed by multiple directors, the movie unfolds like a docudrama and is a 3- hour epic that remains compelling for the majority of its runtime.By allowing the British, American & German directors to handle segments of their own nationality, Zanuch is able to provide the film a much-needed impartiality, and even manages to evoke some sympathy from all the three parties. One can tell the extensive amount of research that went into its production, for some scenes that seemed too far-fetched to be true are surprisingly factual.A major portion of the movie is devoted to the wait, analysis & preparation of the Allied invasion, and Germans' response to prevent it from succeeding instead of the gruesome battle that unfolded on the Normandy beaches. Some moments are disturbing & upsetting, others brim with suspenseful vibes, and few even manage to squeeze in little laughter. All in all, it's a superbly executed effort.Its grand scope is reflected by the massive extras & huge ensemble that show up on the screen, and everyone play their part rather well, except John Wayne who's a tad too full of himself here. Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Sean Connery & many more notable actors show up here n there but their presence never becomes bigger than the story itself, plus the roles they are assigned are cameos anyway.On an overall scale, The Longest Day is a comprehensively researched, brilliantly directed, deftly written, crisply photographed, patiently edited, thumpingly scored & finely performed account of one of the most memorable events that occurred during the Second World War, and is brought to cinematic life in a concise, controlled & calculated manner. One of the best examples of its genre that still carries elements of surprise, The Longest Day lives up to its legacy in splendid fashion.",Null,2,4,29 July 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Muddled. Bloated. Uninspiring.
","Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class was a highly refreshing take on the origin stories of the significant members of X-Men universe. A reboot of the series (sort of), it made really effective use of the provided clean slate to put up a thoroughly gripping tale that delivered on all fronts. Three years later, X-Men: Days of Future Past followed which allowed director Bryan Singer to return to the franchise he himself brought to life back in 2000. And it didn't just succeed as a worthy sequel to First Class but also served as a fitting conclusion to the original X-Men trilogy.What impressed me most about Days of Future Past was the remarkable balance it exhibited while juggling different timelines, in addition to its exquisite handling of the arcs of multitudes of characters, all carried out without compromising with the entertainment factor. The post-credit sequence in that movie did tease an ambitious storyline for the next instalment and that's what X- Men: Apocalypse is. But this time, Bryan Singer fails to duplicate what he pulled off so seamlessly in his last venture, for Apocalypse is a muddled, bloated & uninspiring second sequel that works only in bits n pieces.The story of X-Men: Apocalypse takes place in the 1980s, a decade after the events of the last film. Charles Xavier (Professor X) has created a haven for his students in his school, enrolling troubled mutants like Scott Summers & Jean Grey. Eric Lehnsherr (Magneto) is living a low-profile life in Poland with a family of his own, while Raven (Mystique) has kept herself busy over the years, freeing enslaved mutants from their captivity. But all of them are brought into conflict when En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse, the world's first mutant, awakens after centuries and, disillusioned with what the world has become in his absence, decides to destroy & remake it.Directed by Bryan Singer, Apocalypse opens on a promising note, for the prologue set in ancient Egypt that covers the tale of En Sabah Nur is intriguing, brilliantly shot & brims with excitement. Even the segment dealing with Eric's life in Poland is quite fascinating but the remainder of the plot fails to keep the interest alive as it delves into a familiar territory and ultimately finishes on a dull, predictable & uninteresting note. Simon Kinberg's screenplay isn't up to the mark either plus it appears as if he wrote the script in a hurry by skipping over deeper character introspections & proper polishing of the final draft, just so that the film can make it to its theatrical release date.Production design team once again does a stellar job at recreating the given timeline. Cinematography aims for a darker tone than its predecessors, the desaturated colour palette adds a grim vibe to its frames, and although the entire picture is encapsulated with an overcast feel, the images retain its sharpness & clarity. Editing is a total mess, for its 144 minutes of runtime is severely felt during the second half, many moments end up overstaying its welcome as the plot meanders over trivial stuff, and overall, the different subplots fail to merge into a unified whole. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff yet much of it comes off as nothing but empty spectacle, and even John Ottman's score is a letdown for the most part.Coming to the performances, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult & Rose Byrne return to reprise their respective roles of Professor X, Magneto, Mystique, Beast & Moira MacTaggert and all of them exhibit greater comfort in their character's skin and play their part convincingly. McAvoy & Fassbender once again stand out from the rest, Lawrence is no slouch either, while both Hoult & Byrne do a capable job with what they are given. Also returning to the fold is Evan Peters as Quicksilver and he pretty much steals the show with another swashbuckling slow-mo sequence but this time, he's beaten by Hugh Jackman whose cameo as Wolverine is a major highlight of X-Men: Apocalypse, in my opinion.The new additions comprise of Oscar Isaac (En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse), Sophie Turner (Jean Grey), Tye Sheridan (Cyclops), Kodi Smit-McPhee (Nightcrawler), Olivia Munn (Psylocke), Alexandra Shipp (Storm) & Ben Hardy (Angel). Playing what's supposed to be the most powerful mutant to surface on the big screen so far, Isaac is totally wasted in his role as Apocalypse fails to live up to his image, is never for once intimidating & is just another addition in the long list of clichéd villains. Turner is more Sansa Stark than Jean Grey here, Smit-McPhee is downright hilarious and plays the comic relief part to near-perfection, while Munn chips in with a strong input. But since she isn't given enough screen time, she is unable to fully explore her character.On an overall scale, lacking the freshness of First Class and creative delights of Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse is the weakest chapter of the three, and it ultimately is to this prequel series what The Last Stand was to the original trilogy. Having directed three films of this franchise previously, this is the first time Singer has struggled to put up a gripping tale about mutants on the film canvas. Not everything is a disaster here but some little refinements in the script would have resulted in a wholly different & better movie. Taking too long to set all its pieces on the board, providing no depth to its new set of characters (especially the main villain), ineffectively handling the arcs of returning characters, putting more emphasis on CGI spectacle & overloaded action, further fractured by its terribly written climax, and downright mediocre in content, X-Men: Apocalypse continues the long-existing Hollywood tradition of finishing a trilogy on a weak, underwhelming & frustrating note. Watch it only if you want to.",Null,1,7,16 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Expected It To Be An Utter Crap & It Truly Lived Up To That Prediction.
","Expected it to be an utter crap & it truly lived up to that prediction. After opening with a pretty good prologue, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a downhill trip from there & follows Peter Parker enjoying his life fighting crime as Spider-Man but having hallucinations of Gwen Stacy's deceased dad whenever he is with her. But soon he has other things to deal with as new villains in town arrive starting with a Spider-Man obsessed fan who after a mishap mutates into Electro. Next comes Harry Osborn who later transforms into Green Goblin & last we have Rhino but the less I talk about this ass-wimp, the better it is.Director Marc Webb tries to do so many things at once in this sequel that the movie as a whole becomes entangled in its own webbing & not a single one of its sub-plots come out as well as one would've liked. The screenplay is dull, camera-work is more focused on 3D experience than contributing to the story, editing leaves so many unnecessary scenes in tact, VFX is where most of its quarter-billion budget seems to have been expended, the entire plot has no sense of direction, characterization is poor & even Hans Zimmer's music fails to deliver this time.The very few things likable about it is the new Spidey costume which now closely resembles the comic books look, the Gwen/Peter chemistry that's on or off throughout the film, Peter/Harry friendship that should've been further explored & the scenes involving Aunt May which feel most authentic on an emotional scale. The recurring cast has done the same job they did in the last film, adding nothing new to talk about in this one. Jamie Foxx hams his way through as Electro, Dane DeHaan has better moments as Harry than Green Goblin & Paul Giamatti's Rhino is far worse than imaginable.Oh n don't be blinded by the false advertisement as Electro plays the main villain, Green Goblin is present only during the final moments but not for too long & Rhino almost doesn't even exist in this film. On an overall scale, the 2nd chapter of this needlessly rebooted franchise delivers another lackluster cinematic experience & proves that the team has learned nothing from the mistakes it made in the last movie. Adding more extravagant elements into its production only to later end up choking on it, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is far less amazing than what it's selling itself as. Do yourself a favour & waste your money on something else.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,7,15,9 May 2014
Back to the Future Part III," A Fitting Conclusion To The Adventures of Doc & Marty
","The third & final instalment in Back to the Future Trilogy, Part III is by all means a much welcome improvement over Part II, and manages to regain the fresh vibe & riveting quality of the original by bringing the delights of a different genre into its sci-fi premise. Picking up from the cliffhanging ending of its muddled predecessor, it is closer in tone to the first film and concludes the trilogy on a satisfying note.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film takes Marty & Doc further than ever before and features a better structured & more refined storyline with a finale that brings the journey full circle. Although there are a few empty stretches in the middle, its Old West setting, homages to western classics & deft use of humour derived from merging the two contrasting genres results in an entry that feels new yet familiar.The time-travel antics are as fun as before while the century old timeline actually suits the story more than the poorly rendered vision of the future. The finale also unravels with same thrilling, nail-biting intensity as the climax of the first feature. And detailed set pieces, dynamic camerawork, steady pace, deftly choreographed action & excellent performances from the cast keep the adventurous aura alive n kicking.Overall, Back to the Future Part III is a fitting conclusion to the adventures of Doc & Marty, and aptly ties up all the loose ends before turning off the lights. The last scene does feel unnecessary to the equation but its presence does not undermine the emotional impact of what occurred before by much. It's pretty much the same ending either way. Expertly crafted, intelligently told & finely acted, Part III wraps up the Back to the Future saga on a memorable note.",Null,2,2,1 April 2020
Patton," An Epic Biographical Account That Fairly Judges Its Unfair Character!
","Grand in scope, accomplished in production & riding high on George C. Scott's magnificent performance, Patton is an epic biographical account of the decorated but also controversial American General, George S. Patton, and covers his stint as tank commander during World War II. Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Patton remains one of the most impressive biopics in existence and is one memoir that's as informative as it is engrossing.Set during the Second World War, Patton follows its titular character who arrives in North Africa to take charge of the demoralised American troops after they suffer heavy casualties at the hands of German forces. The plot covers his stint as he leads his soldiers to victory over the enemy before heading to Europe where he would go on to script one of the most astonishing sweeps in warfare history. Over the course of its runtime, the film also focuses on his human flaws.Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner & co-written by Francis Ford Coppola, Patton opens with a massive American flag pinned on the entire canvas where we are introduced to the titular character who then goes on to deliver the now infamous monologue, which in addition to beginning the story on an instantly captivating note also offers an insight into his colourful & no-nonsense persona. The main plot then follows which is a character study that takes as much interest in Patton's strengths as a leader as it does in his faults as a human.The production design team is in charge of a huge canvas here & they fill the wide locations with set pieces that are more or less in tune with documented history, whether it's the tanks or outfits or battlefields. Also adding enhancement to its imagery is the brilliantly controlled camera-work that makes sure that every moment is captured in fine detail. At 172 minutes, it is a daunting film to sit through this biopic but the runtime isn't even felt for the most part. And Jerry Goldsmith contributes with a militarised score that skilfully compliments the story & keeps its tone in tact.The acting department is spearheaded by George C. Scott who turns the picture into a one- man-show with his memorable performance as George S. Patton. Taking a much balanced approach in the rendition of his character, Scott is able to exhibit the best & worst traits of the notorious General with immaculate precision and carries the whole film on his shoulders with effortless ease. Although it's easy to hate this character, there are also moments when you can't help admiring him for Scott does well in balancing both positive & negative sides of Patton, plus he's brilliantly supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, Patton is every bit worthy of all the accolades it has garnered since its release and is definitely amongst the finest examples of biopics & war filmmaking out there. It's a thoroughly engaging cinema that makes you root for as well as criticise the same man who was admired for his leadership but was also lambasted for his distorted philosophy of life. It's not just the characterisation aspect that's laudable here for the movie is technically sound as well and the battle sequences have a gritty, realistic feel to it. An important lesson in biopic filmmaking that offers a fair treatment to an unfair personality, Patton is absolutely worth your time & money.",Null,0,0,12 November 2015
La Grande Illusion," Undone By Its Overly Pacifist Approach
","Considered by many to be one of the greatest films ever made, The Grand Illusion (also called La Grande Illusion) is far too kind & considerate for a war film. While it is apt in its depiction of the absurdity & futility of war, and attempts to appeal to the universal humanity that transcends man-made boundaries, its anti-war themes are somewhat diluted by its overly pacifist approach.Co-written & directed by Jean Renoir, this is my first stint with his works and though the humanist lens & class relationships do make for an interesting study, its portrait of warfare is no different from what a child imagines war to be. The absolute lack of horror, destruction & suffering that warfare leaves in its wake is appalling. It is naive to condemn war but not illustrate why it's worthy of condemnation.Renoir here possibly argues that regardless of our national identities, our collective experience is more common than it seems and in that regard, war is utterly useless. But the generosity & compassion with which enemies interact with one another is a tad too unrealistic for me to look past. On one hand, the script treats everyone with respect & doesn't vilify anyone. One another, it's nothing more than wishful thinking.Overall, The Grand Illusion features intriguing themes, radiates pure humanity in all its frames, and is led by good performances from its ensemble cast. While most will resonate with its humanistic perspective of war, some like me may find its treatment rather insulting. A future revisit might change my perception but for now, this French classic is no less than a frustrating slog whose legendary repute is in n itself a grand illusion for me.",Null,0,0,20 May 2020
The Illusionist," Everything In Here Is An Illusion!
","Together with Christopher Nolan's The Prestige & Woody Allen's Scoop, The Illusionist is one of the three films released in 2006 which explores the world of stage magicians and even though it doesn't quite reach the creative heights of Nolan's thriller, it's a neatly crafted period drama that manages to leave its own enchantments on the viewers' emotions, thanks to its brilliant direction, smart writing & sincere performances.Set in late 19th century Vienna, The Illusionist tells the story of Eisenheim, a renowned illusionist who uses his magical abilities to secure the love of a woman far above his social standing. When she becomes engaged to the Crown Prince, who himself comes with a rumoured history of brutality towards women, Eisenberg tries to free her from her shackles thus causing a series of conflicts between him & the Crown Prince that doesn't end too well for one of them.Written & directed by Neil Burger, the film remains his finest work to date and is narrated in a non-chronological but cleverly edited manner that keeps the viewers' emotions invested in its premise. Cinematography is undoubtedly gorgeous, the other technical aspects are pretty sound in its execution, and the performances by Edward Norton, Paul Giammati & Jessica Biel are excellent with Giammati impressing the most as the cop torn between his duty & allegiance.On an overall scale, The Illusionist is more or less a love story encapsulated with elements of period drama that works as an intriguing, engaging & entertaining cinema from start to finish. There are moments when it leaves the audience a bit lost with its characters' actions & motivations but in the end, every piece of puzzle eventually fits. All in all, The Illusionist may not be that great a magic trick that'll be forever remembered but it's stunning enough to leave its viewers in a state of absolute bliss for a while.

Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," One of the Finest Anime of Its Time
","The anime whose critical & commercial success led to the formation of the now legendary Studio Ghibli, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is a masterwork of imagination & creativity which tells the story of a young princess who believes in peace & harmony and tries to stop an impending war between humans & mutant giant insects in a post-apocalyptic world.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film also brings on surface the current world issues like war & its futility, rising environmental pollution, shifts in ecological balance around the world & the ignorance of mankind to all these important matters due to greed, power or corruption. The animation is visually delightful & voice actors have done a fine job in voicing their carefully fleshed out characters.Cinematography elegantly captures its subject matter in meticulous detail, editing could've managed a few more trims, music is most impressive in the third act & its themes concerning the environmental issues are smartly presented to the viewers. On an overall scale, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind may not be the masterpiece that I was expecting after having heard so many great things about it but it sure is one of the finest animation films of its time.",Null,1,2,24 April 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Life Can Only Be Understood Backward. It Must Be Lived Forward.
","A David Fincher film that's quite unlike any other David Fincher film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button marks the esteemed filmmaker's first foray into a genre that's very different compared to his usuals, is a fascinating portrait of life seen from a different perspective, and even though it may not be not as amazing as Fincher's best works, it's certainly his most distinct film to date.Inspired from F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story of the same name, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tells the life story of its titular character, who was born with all the characteristics of an old man but starts getting younger in appearance as the years pass by. The film covers his adventures & experiences as he journeys through life in reverse, & also follows the life of Daisy; his love interest.Directed by David Fincher, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button features many of the director's trademarks, especially in its visual & sound design but it's not a film that many of his fans will enjoy or appreciate. Fincher shows a fine grip on storytelling elements here, keeps each event firmly glued to another & does a pretty neat job in wrapping up the project that had been stuck in development hell for years.Coming to the technical aspects, Set pieces are well-detailed & fit the different timelines they are depicted in, Cinematography benefits a lot from Fincher's sweeping cinematic vision & the colour composition is spot-on, Editing could've paced the story a little better for its runtime is felt on few occasions, Visual effects & make-up work in near-perfect harmony with each other, and Alexandre Desplat's score is a welcome one.As far as performances go, the screen is shared by either Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett or both for the most part, and the two stars chip in with fabulous contributions in their given roles. Adding further strength to its cast are Tilda Swinton & Taraji P. Henson, but there's nothing memorable about the acting here. More than the performances & the narrative, it's how the events are filmed which leaves a lasting impression.On an overall scale, David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button often gets a lot of flak from his admirers & others but it isn't as bad as they say, it's just quite different. I really enjoyed watching it, absolutely loved that monologue when Button travels to India & don't really mind recommending it to anyone. There are many similarities between this & Forrest Gump, so if you like that Tom Hanks starrer, you're very likely to have a good time with this one.",Null,0,1,12 January 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," Presented As The Fable Of A Young American Against The Entire Soviet Empire!
","From the director of Glory, The Last Samurai & Blood Diamond, Pawn Sacrifice arrives as a consistently thrilling, wonderfully paced & ably performed picture that attempts to bring on screen the life story of the American chess prodigy, Bobby Fischer, and chronicles the rise & fall of the grandmaster who went on to redefine the game of chess like never before.Set during the height of the Cold War, the story of Pawn Sacrifice is mainly concerned with the rivalry between Bobby Fischer & Boris Spassky, a Soviet chess wiz who was the world champion back then. The plot overviews Fischer's childhood & meteoric rise in the arena of chess that reaches its pinnacle in the 1972 World Chess Championship and also covers his descent into madness.Directed by Edward Zwick, Pawn Sacrifice takes its time to set up the board pieces during the first act, which is then followed by Fischer showing signs of deteriorating mental health in addition to his increasing contempt & arrogance which further amplifies as the film nears its conclusion. Zwick does a neat job in bringing the brilliant screenplay to life but what the film lacks is that element which turns a good film great.The technical aspects are finely executed. Cinematography makes good use of colour filters & changing frame rate for moments that are intended to be shown as archival footages and the camera is nicely utilised for the most part. Its 115 minutes of runtime could've used few more trims. The input from its cast is commendable, with Tobey Maguire standing out for he carries the film on his own and his confused expressions totally suited his character.On an overall scale, Pawn Sacrifice isn't memorable by any means but it manages to keep a firm grip on the viewers' attention for the most part and also succeeds in turning a game of chess into a nail-bitingly tense affair. The plot brims with political undertones, illustrates the controversial side of Bobby Fischer and thanks to Maguire's poised input, makes us admire as well as despise the same person in equal measure. Not a great biopic by any means but definitely an entertaining one, Pawn Sacrifice is worth a shot.",Null,3,7,15 December 2015
Magic Mike XXL," XXL Times Better Than Magic Mike
","Brimming with a refreshing energy and setting the stage on fire with its erotically charged aura, Magic Mike XXL is a definite improvement over its predecessor that fully embraces its strengths, is well aware of its limitations, and discards almost everything that it can do without to deliver a romp ride that's light, simple & pure delight from beginning to end.Set 3 years after the events of the first film, Magic Mike XXL finds Mike running his own furniture business like he always wanted but a part of him still misses that old profession. Things are set in motion when he receives a call from his former mates and learns that they've been abandoned by Dallas and plan to bow out with one last performance and decides to join them in their endeavour.Directed by Gregory Jacobs, Magic Mike XXL trims out everything that stopped the previous film from stretching its arms & legs, and travels a better aligned route. Also, unlike the original, all the subplots head in the same direction as its central storyline, characters get more room to breathe, and there's a sense of history & togetherness in the group's bonding that's genuinely felt in their interactions.The plot takes the structure of a road trip movie that covers the themes of life, love & friendship as it moves ahead and the music & dance numbers are in perfect harmony with each other and is one key element that makes it blissful on so many levels. Images are more sleek, dance choreography undergoes a major upgrade and it simply packs the right amount of energy & erotica that makes a stripping performance great.Coming to the performances, the absence of Matthew McConaughey doesn't hurt the film much as his absence is rarely felt. Channing Tatum makes excellent use of the leading spot and contributes with a physically exhausting yet downright seductive performance in his reprising role. Manganiello gets more screen time than before and does well with what he's given while the newcomers are no slouch and ably play their part.On an overall scale, Magic Mike XXL has XXL times the magic & charisma of its predecessor and is a worthy follow-up by all means. Its simple storytelling & lighthearted flair may not impress those looking for a deeper inspection of the male stripping profession but its testosterone-fuelled atmosphere, lustful moves, beefy allure & surprising evolution into an unabashed celebration of female desire turns it into one of the most enjoyable & entertaining delights of its year.",Null,4,7,17 May 2017
Hidden Figures," A Welcome Tribute To The Real Brains Behind One Of Mankind's Proudest Achievements
","Tweaking the real-life events every now n then to highlight the issues prevalent during its timeline and for some added dramatic effect as well, Hidden Figures is a mostly lighthearted & competently made biopic about the three unsung heroes whose key contributions made it possible for mankind to leave its footprint on the moon.Set during the 1960s, Hidden Figures covers the story of three African-American women who work as human computers at NASA. The main plot follows Katherine Johnson, a maths wunderkind, who is assigned to the Space Task Group to work on their latest project and, along with Mary Jackson & Dorothy Vaughan, made the impossible possible.Co-written & directed by Theodore Melfi, the story is narrated in an amusing but insightful fashion and keeps a stringent focus on its trio of characters. The plot mostly covers their remarkable work at NASA but every now n then, it would offer a little glimpse into their private lives. The screenplay smooths out the narrative by modifying a few details but it works in the film's favour.The racial & gender issues it presents within the feature are as relevant today as it was at its time, however, the director does well to balance its thought-provoking themes with other elements and makes sure that it remains an enjoyable, accessible & universally appealing ride. Last but not the least, its warm colour palette, well-timed humour & fluid camera-work makes it even more inviting.The three relevant characters exhibit well-defined arcs and are expertly brought to life by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer & Janelle Monáe. Kevin Costner & Kirsten Dunst chip in with serviceable inputs while Jim Parsons feels like a miscast. Also, if his presence alone is enough to convince you that he must be playing some intelligent guy, then you have been watching a terrible TV show for far too long.On an overall scale, Hidden Figures is as enjoyable as it is informative, and is a welcome tribute to the genius minds who were responsible for some of our proudest achievements. The undercurrent of Cold War paranoia is evident throughout the story and is overdone at times but the movie retains its uplifting feeling till the very end. Bringing into light the real brains behind human spaceflight's greatest triumph, Hidden Figures is an amusing, entertaining & satisfying delight.",Null,3,8,13 February 2017

With thousands of people getting slaughtered everyday, Lincoln races against time to secure the future of his nation by obtaining enough votes before it is too late.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the 21st century has been a semi-retirement mode for the revered filmmaker but every once in a while, he does give us a glimpse of why he is one of the best in the business for Lincoln is crafted with precision attention to detail & accuracy, is highly character-driven & technically sound. Tony Kushner's script is another little gem that's patient with its content & takes a methodical approach in bringing the story to life.Production design is stellar for the story really benefits from its authentic set pieces. Same can be said about the costumes as well. Cinematography makes excellent use of lighting & camera movements. Editing is where Lincoln becomes a two-way street for its deliberately slowed down pace makes the drama more immersive for some while for others, it becomes a snooze fest. And John Williams' music is yet another mesmerising addition to Spielberg- Williams collaboration.But what actually saves the film & makes it worth sitting through all the frustrating & snail- paced narrative is the breathtaking performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. Nailing the looks, mannerisms & possibly the voice as well, Day-Lewis absolutely steals the show & it's hard to look elsewhere when he's on the screen. Sally Field ends up being a bit hammy in her role of Mary Todd Lincoln while Tommy Lee Jones is as reliable as ever in his rendition of Thaddeus Stevens.On an overall scale, Lincoln may not be what mainstream audience like to call 'entertaining' due to its dialogue-driven plot, glacial pace, political storyline & lack of action but it still makes up for an engaging & informative historical drama that sheds an interesting light on the legend whose oratory skills & leadership qualities has continued to inspire & influence the politics around the world. Riding on Spielberg's assured direction & bolstered by Day-Lewis' knockout performance, Lincoln comes thoroughly recommended.",Null,1,2,7 October 2013

The events progress in smooth, effective manner from start to finish while the songs are expertly placed at just the right moments to exquisitely capture the underlying context of the emotions on surface.Production design team does well to nicely capture the period details of the timeline its plot is set in. Cinematography encapsulates the entire feature with an overcast ambiance with warm & cold colours utilised as per the scene requirements. Editing provides a steady pace to its 105 minutes narrative with each scene only taking the story forward while songs are composed from scratch and have an infectious quality to them.Coming to the performances, Sing Street features a relatively unknown but incredibly committed cast in Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Lucy Boynton, Mark McKenna, Jack Raynor, Aidan Gillen & Maria Doyle Kennedy and everyone does an excellent job with what they are given. Walsh-Peelo in particular is a standout and shares brilliant chemistry with both Boynton & McKenna while Raynor pretty much steals the show in every scene he appears in.On an overall scale, Sing Street is the feel-good movie of the year that's euphonic in both happy & sad moments and manages to incorporate a mix of both with amazing comfort. A healthy dose of entertainment that treads the fine line between wishful fantasy & cold reality that promises plenty of laughs & hints of tears, this bittersweet coming-of-age musical comedy hits the right chords at the right time throughout its runtime and is one of the best films of 2016.

But his increasing obsession with numbers ultimately results in his self-destruction when he's driven to the brink of madness by the people who are after his research.Written & directed by Darren Aronofsky, the film gives us a glimpse of his precision eye for art & aesthetics, is cleverly narrated from start to finish, and marks a sensational start to his directional career. Finely captured in greyscale photography, the camera-work exhibits a number of innovative tricks which he went on to use extensively in his later works & also provides a haunting atmosphere to the whole picture.But it's not just Aronofsky who makes his debut in the film industry with this feature for it also launched the film scoring career of Clint Mansell who provides an uncanny score to go with its equally bizarre plot. Sean Gullette delivers an excellent performance in the role of Max & carries the film amazingly well throughout its 84 minutes of runtime and he's nicely supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, Pi is a smartly crafted psychological thriller that blends the mathematical patterns with religious beliefs in a very enthralling manner & offers a cinematic experience that's surreal in every sense of the word. Introducing Aronofsky's fresh psyche bursting with new ideas, Pi is an instant classic that remains one of the finest debuts for any filmmaker in recent memory.

Million Dollar Baby," Clint Eastwood + Hilary Swank + Morgan Freeman = A Knockout Masterpiece!
","Bolstered by knockout performances, balanced in all aspects of storytelling & finishing on a high note with a gut-wrenching finale, Million Dollar Baby is a wonderfully crafted, brilliantly narrated & expertly paced sports drama that may seem like just another underdog story at first but changes its course in the middle to end up as something else entirely.The story of Million Dollar Baby follows an old, rugged & experienced but under-appreciated boxing trainer who has spent a lifetime in the ring training some incredible fighters but also finds himself being haunted by his past mistakes, for which he tries to make up by taking an amateur boxer under his wing & help her achieve her dream of becoming a professional.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film presents the actor-director in prime form & is the finest work of his directional career, in my opinion. The screenplay also deserves a mention for its character-driven narrative & the exhaustive level of depth provided to its characters makes it all the more commendable. And further refining its quality is the accomplished work in the technical department.Production design team chips in nicely with well-detailed sets. Cinematography is easily my favourite aspect for the way its camera employs the controlled zooms, close-ups, slow-mo & sharp focus makes the drama all the more immersive, which is then further enhanced by precision lighting. Editing patiently paces the story & the background score, composed by Eastwood himself is perfectly in tune with the story.Coming to the performances, Million Dollar Baby packs in a highly impressive cast in Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank & Morgan Freeman with all three delivering strong performances in their given roles. Eastwood is as good in front of the camera as he's behind it. Swank steals the show with her career-best performance while Freeman is pretty grounded in his role yet his input & narration play a vital role in the experience this film provides.On an overall scale, Million Dollar Baby is one of the finest examples of sports drama that may give an impression of travelling the Rocky route for a while but a surprising twist in the middle completely ends up changing the whole equation & from there on, it's an entirely different experience. A profoundly affecting, deeply heartbreaking & thoroughly engaging cinema, Million Dollar Baby is — in pure & simple words — a knockout masterpiece. Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,4 June 2010
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A Ghoulish Tale with Wicked Humour & Stunning Animation.
","A pioneering work of animation at its time, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stop-motion animation musical concerning the Pumpkin King of the Halloweenland named Jack Skellington who is bored from planning the annual Halloween celebrations every year. While on his way back home, he discovers a portal to Christmasland & is instantly infatuated with the lively Christmas spirit. Unable to understand its concept, he decides to celebrate the holiday & gets the residents of his town to help him prepare for it which, as expected, goes wrong.Due to its dark, brooding & creepy yet hilarious atmosphere, many mistake this film to be Tim Burton's work, which is further complicated by his name on the title which was strictly for marketing purposes. But it's actually Henry Selick who helms the director's chair with writing & production credits going to Burton. The film makes brilliant use of stop-motion animation blended with puppetry to come out as something fresh, original & intensely creative plus the steadily narrated story only helps the film work charmingly well.The script is very lively, the concept is new as well, cinematography is distinctive, editing manages to trim the film enough to tell its tale under 80 minutes, the voice actors are nicely cast & music as well as songs by Danny Elfman is a strong supportive character in itself that makes the story work with Elfman also voicing many characters. On an overall scale, The Nightmare Before Christmas would've been an unforgettable experience had I watched it at a younger age but as of now, although it didn't disappoint, I still felt no real affection towards it.",Null,0,0,17 April 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Promising Start, Thanks To Noomi Rapace's Show-Stealing Performance.
","The 1st feature of the Millennium Trilogy, adapted from Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an ingeniously crafted mystery that expertly manages to retain its enigmatic atmosphere, tense feel & disturbing themes from start to finish by presenting its dark story in an unflinching manner and is as merciless as the subject it deals with.It tells the story of an infamous journalist who teams up with a young, tattooed & wildly eccentric computer hacker to investigate the case of a woman who inexplicably went missing 40 years ago without any trace. But the further they advance with the case, the more they put their lives on risk as the family that employed them is prepared to go to any lengths to protect its appalling secrets.Brilliantly directed & certainly not compromised in any manner, this Swedish thriller is an absolutely scarring experience with its brutal take on rape & violence and features quality level of craftsmanship in almost every single aspect of its filmmaking. Yet the best thing about The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is undeniably the terrific performances from its entire cast that provides this trilogy the promising start it needed.Noomi Rapace stars as Lisbeth Salander on whom the entire novel series is based on and is absolutely sensational, ruthless & magnificent in her given role. Michael Nyqvist also does a very good job as Mikael Blomkvist. The performances by the supporting cast is also impressive & believable which further helped in making the drama more captivating.On an overall scale, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent transition of Larsson's most famous novel on the silver screen and even though it might appear a bit too overlong in the end, for what it's worth, this film just works.

Big Hero 6," Big Hero 6 Continues Disney's Resurgence Towards Its Lost Glory.
","From the creators of Wreck-It Ralph & Frozen comes another impressive outing that's as fresh, smart & intuitive as the above mentioned films and, apart from continuing the recent success streak for the studio, also marks their first foray into the genre of superhero filmmaking as the premise is based on Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name.The story of Big Hero 6 concerns a young prodigy who develops a special bond with his older brother's creation called Baymax; an inflatable robot designed to serve as a personal health companion. But when Hiro discovers his own creation being used for evil purposes, he transforms Baymax & his friends into a band of high-tech heroes to take on the person responsible.Directed by Don Hall & Chris Williams, the first half is filled with lots of creativity, passion & ideas that are seamlessly blended with elements of humour which is then presented in a very polished manner while the other half takes a more generic route but nevertheless succeeds in maintaining a fine balance between its emotional & humorous aspects to wrap itself up as one of the most polished films of the year.Coming to technical aspects, the 3D animation is absolutely gorgeous for each frame is rendered in meticulous detail with expert use of colour contrast, saturation & sharpness to provide an intensely vibrant look to the whole picture. Camera-work is brilliantly carried out for it's pretty dynamic in the action sequences while more relaxed during dramatic moments. Editing briskly paces the whole story while Henry Jackman's score further enhances the experience.Yet the best thing about Big Hero 6 remains its interesting set of perfectly voiced & finely written characters with the constantly developing bond between Hiro & Baymax serving as the core ingredient that makes this film work on so many levels. Baymax is the standout character here for he's simply impossible to not love and his cuddly, cushy & innocent appearance blended with soothing voice brings a charm of its own to make him an instantly huggable character.On an overall scale, Big Hero 6 is a sweet, funny, touching & colourful tale of companionship that's richly animated, skilfully narrated & emotionally satisfying and has something in store for viewers of all ages. Sophisticated in all departments, filled with heart & compassion, and exquisitely demonstrating the best of both Disney & Marvel in one action-packed feature that's full of awe & admiration, Big Hero 6 continues Disney's resurgence towards its lost glory & is one of this year's finest animated flicks.P.S.

Grave of the Fireflies," An Achievement Not Only For Studio Ghibli But Animation As A Whole.
","A profoundly moving, emotionally devastating & truly heartbreaking tale that'll effortlessly find itself on the list of cinema's greatest tear-jerkers, Grave of the Fireflies is a beautifully crafted story that explores the relationship between two siblings & covers their struggle to survive in the war-torn city of Kobe, Japan during the final months of Second World War.Directed by Isao Takahata, this is his first film under Studio Ghibli production banner, which he co-founded with Hayao Miyazaki, & remains one of the proudest achievements for not only the director or the animation studio but the entire animation genre itself. The dynamics of the brother-sister relationship is beautifully expressed on the screen & voice actors have done a splendid job too in bringing these characters to life.The hand-drawn animation is beautiful, evocative & aesthetically pleasing, the effects of war on civilian life is strongly felt, music is minimal yet eloquent & the manner in which the fate of its main characters is unraveled is so depressing that it'll leave many teary-eyed. On an overall scale, Grave of the Fireflies is an absolutely heartbreaking, haunting & harrowing piece of quality cinema that remains one of Studio Ghibli's most defining works & is powerful enough to rank high amongst other war films too.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Different For The Sake Of Being Different
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a cinematic event unlike anything. The buzz it created from the moment its first teaser went live resulted in a blockbuster release that shattered many box-office records during its theatrical run and gave the fans & newcomers their money's worth of big-budget extravaganza. It was also the first Star Wars film that I actually enjoyed watching.The onus was now on Rian Johnson who was entrusted with the next episode in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. There's no denying that the middle chapter is always the hardest but where many detractors complained that The Force Awakens didn't do anything different from the norm, what Johnson does here is only gonna make them wish they could take it all back.Set in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Last Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi) follows two simultaneously unfolding storylines. One concerns Rey who has finally found Luke Skywalker who helps her develop her newly discovered abilities. The other segment follows The First Order that has the Resistance on its last legs.Written & directed by Rian Johnson (best known for Looper), The Last Jedi deviates a tad too far from the course in its attempt to do something different. Full of pacing & tonal issues, Episode VIII is a convoluted mess from start to finish but what sucks about it is that most of its shortcomings were easily rectifiable, all it needed was more refined script & tighter editing.Another issue is that it fails to integrate new characters into its universe. Add to that, there is an entire subplot that it could have done without. The humour is jarring & falls flat most times. There is no consistency between its flow of events. And some decisions make no sense whatsoever. There is nothing wrong in taking a different route as long as it all adds up and in this film's case, it doesn't.Coming to the acting department, the best performance comes from Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker better than he ever did before. Daisy Ridley builds on her last act to deliver another strong performance as Rey, Adam Driver embraces the dark side as Kylo Ren, and the chemistry between him & Rey carries a spark. Amongst the new additions, Kelly Marie Tran as Rose is absolutely cringeworthy.On an overall scale, Star Wars: The Last Jedi fails to make the most of the strong foundation that was provided to it by The Force Awakens, and is a disappointing episode that suffers from Rian Johnson's unfocused direction & unrefined script. Somewhere within this film lies a highly gripping & endlessly riveting adventure fantasy that would've satisfied most. Biting off more than it can chew, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is different for the sake of being different.",Null,12,17,17 March 2018
Brave," Pixar's Recovery Begins On A Brave Note.
","Winner of Academy Award for Best Animated Film, Pixar's Brave is their only Oscar-winning feature to date that doesn't feel worthy of such honour for it travels a much safer & risk-free route unlike any of their previous works plus features a narrative that bears more similarity to Disney films than Pixar's unconventional method of storytelling.Set in the Scottish Highlands, Brave tells the story of Merida; a skilled archer & princess who defies an old-age custom of her kingdom by choosing to not be betrothed. Wanting to take control of her own life rather than let it be decided by others, she stumbles upon a witch & asks for a spell to fulfil her wish, which goes horribly wrong.Directed by Mark Andrews & Brenda Chapman, Brave is what you get when you marry Disney's own fairy-tale elements with Pixar's unprecedented animation. While there's much to criticise just because it isn't the way Pixar generally do these things but there are also plenty of things to admire about, including the character of Merida who is no typical Disney princess.While the story doesn't hold enough strength, Pixar's animation is still as jaw-dropping as it has always been. The images are breathtaking to look at, thanks to the incredible amount of detail present in its photo-realistic images as well as its expert use of colours & lighting, pacing is excellent in the first half, and its wonderful depiction of Scottish heritage is a welcome treat.Patrick Doyle's score is mesmerising, beautiful & intimate, and stitches itself beautifully with the depicted era of kilts & bagpipes. Its homage to earlier Disney classics & Studio Ghibli is nicely done. The characters are funny, colourful & really benefit from its near-perfect voice cast who truly nail the required Scottish accent, while Merida herself steps us as the brave, fearless & strong-willed princess we aren't usually accustomed to.Yet, there's no denying that I expected much more from this film because the trailers sort of promised it as a celebration of a young woman's independence instead of what it actually turned out to be i.e. a story about mother-daughter bonding. I still had a wonderful time with Brave, was thoroughly entertained by it if not blown away for it offers plenty of laughs throughout its runtime, has a playful tone & is gorgeously rendered.On an overall scale, Pixar's first-foray into the fairy-tale sub-genre may not be the rebound this pioneering animation studio needed after its first taste of failure with Cars 2 in the preceding year but Brave still falls in the right direction in Pixar's road to recovery. Fun, adventurous, enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying, Brave is no groundbreaking cinema but its vivid portrayal of fate & family is still something that I absolutely & unexpectedly adored.",Null,1,1,7 October 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel Studios' Biggest Gamble To Date... That Pays Off Tremendously Well.
","From the studio that brought us Iron Man, Captain America, Thor & The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy arrives as Marvel Studios' biggest gamble to date and yet the risk pays off tremendously well as this crazy mixture of an oddball cast & an eccentric crew strikes gold for the studio in both critical & commercial departments and succeeds as an immensely enjoyable, extremely entertaining & most satisfying Marvel piece since The Avengers.Set in a galaxy far far away, Guardian of the Galaxy concerns a notorious scavenger who finds himself as the main target of a manhunt after stealing a mysterious orb and is put in prison along with a deadly assassin, a genetically-engineered raccoon & a tree-like humanoid where they encounter a brute looking for vengeance. As an uneasy alliance form between these extra- terrestrial misfits, they learn to work together as a team & try to save the world when a greater threat arises.There is so much in here that could've so easily gone wrong and there's no denying that many eyebrows were raised when James Gunn was brought in to direct this high-budget space epic. But he has directed this picture with such precision craftsmanship that it feels like a work of an auteur & the remarkable use of humour infused into its blockbuster elements only makes the experience all the more amusing, enriching & delightfully engaging.Coming to its technical aspects, every single filmmaking department works in near-perfect harmony with the other in a manner that only elevates its overall story & characters to new heights. Set pieces are impressive to look at, make-up adds a dimension of its own to its characters, its homage to many space classics is tastefully carried out, cinematography makes dynamic use of camera without ever getting carried away, editing is tight, VFX is seamless & the selection of songs is near-perfect.The cast is as eccentric & diverse as the characters present in the film with Chris Pratt (Peter Quill), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Dave Bautista (Drax), Vin Diesel (Groot) & Bradley Cooper (Rocket) playing the role of Guardians and each of them deliver excellent performances with Groot & Rocket leaving the most lasting impression. Also chipping in with fine doses are Lee Pace (Ronan), Michael Rooker (Yondu) & Karen Gillian (Nebula), with brief appearance from Benicio del Toro & John C. Reilly also adding more flavours to the film.On an overall scale, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most exquisitely balanced cinematic offerings of 2014 that promises a lot of fun from start to finish and seamlessly delivers it in an endlessly entertaining & immensely rewarding manner. Ingeniously directed, wonderfully light- hearted, fluidly photographed, skilfully edited, splendidly performed & featuring dazzling visuals, Guardians of the Galaxy is arguably the ballsiest big-budget production to surface on the silver screen since James Cameron's Avatar.",Null,5,10,12 October 2014

The Imitation Game," In Memory of The Unsung Heroes of World War II
","The Second World War is the single greatest phenomenon in the history of mankind. No other event comes even marginally close to the impact World War II had on global scale for it not only altered the political & social structure around the world but also ended up enriching the fields of art, literature, films & television with countless events, so many that even after 70 years we're still in the process of discovering entirely new things about it.Now The Imitation Game doesn't really bring anything new to the film canvas in that regard but it sheds more light on the unsung heroes whose wartime breakthroughs & contributions played a major role in changing the outcome of the last great war. The film tells the story of the legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing & his team of code-breakers racing against time to break the Nazi Germany's Enigma-encrypted codes in order to get ahead of their enemy.Brilliantly directed by Morten Tyldum, the entire story is narrated in 3 overlapping plot lines, each covering a different stage of Turing's life, and is quite gripping when those elements align to work as one but then it also stumbles with its non-linear narration whenever it shifts from one timeline to another, which feels abrupt & intrusive. Graham Moore's screenplay wonderfully glosses over Turing's life & plays out many events in a pretty authentic manner.Coming to technical aspects, Production Design team's most notable work is the electro- mechanical bombe itself which Turing designed to decipher the Enigma-generated ciphers. Filming locations are wisely chosen to keep it as authentic as possible. Cinematography makes fine use of camera, neatly balances the colour hues & retains the image sharpness till the end. Editing is a mixed bag, while Alexandre Desplat once again delivers with a very fitting score.As far as performances go, The Imitation Game features a reliable cast in Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance & others, and the performances are definitely one of its stronger aspects. Leading from the front is Cumberbatch who is absolutely outstanding in the role of Alan Turing, Knightley is surprisingly good as Joan Clarke & the rest of the supporting cast also chip in with vital contributions to lift the story up by a great extent.On an overall scale, The Imitation Game is an interesting portrait of an eccentric individual whose works have been highly influential in the fields of computer science & artificial intelligence, is a heartbreaking story of a misfit who never publicly received the credit for his game-changing wartime efforts, and is a biting view of one of United Kingdom's most disgraceful acts that covers how badly he was treated in the post-war era. An engaging, entertaining & satisfying flick from start to finish, this historical drama is worth a shot.",Null,2,9,30 January 2015
The Evil Dead," Sam Raimi's Breakthrough Feature Is An Absurd Mix Of Chilling Horror & Ludicrous Comedy
","Horror comedies aren't really my thing. It's a mashup of two polar opposite genres that works for me only when it's more a comedy than horror i.e. the latter aspects are diluted to a great extent. However, when the horror part is expertly executed & genuinely effective, the presence of humour in the subsequent moments feels like a spoilsport.And that's exactly what happened with The Evil Dead. The entire build-up, the ominous ambiance, the jump scares, excess gore & violence, and almost all the aspects that make a horror film stand out are utilised to near-perfection but their impact is instantly doused by the ludicrous sequences & surplus campiness and it pretty much ruins the whole experience.The story of The Evil Dead takes place at a remote cabin in the woods where five college students arrive to spend a peaceful weekend. While exploring the place, they come across an ancient book & an audiotape and inadvertently release a demonic force from the surrounding forest which takes them one by one, and turns their vacation into a nightmarish race for survival.Written & directed by Sam Raimi, The Evil Dead is his breakthrough feature film and combines the elements of horror & comedy in a wicked manner to provide an experience that's as spine-tingling as it is absurd. It's a weird state to be in, shocked at one moment while laughing uncontrollably at other times and it may be the very reason behind its strong cult following over the years.The film's isolated surrounding evoke a sinister aura from the beginning, and the way Raimi builds up its tense atmosphere is worthy of a mention. The jump scares keep surfacing from time to time and the inventive camera-work only adds to its eerie mood. But all of it is diminished by its farcical wit while the exaggerated performances from its cast leaves you wondering what it aims to do.On an overall scale, The Evil Dead is cited by many as one of the greatest horror films ever made but I don't share that sentiment. I do believe, however, that it would've been a downright thrilling chiller had Raimi aimed for a full-fledged horror than his patented mix of two opposing genres. All in all, I'm sure many dig its uniqueness & the jarring experience it provides but I'm equally certain that it isn't for me.",Null,0,2,2 April 2017
8 Mile," A Definite Must For Eminem Fans.
","The semi-autobiographical account of the greatest hip-hop artist of all time, alive or dead, is actually a pretty enjoyable & nicely put together piece of work that also marks Eminem's acting debut at which he does a surprisingly good job, and despite featuring a familiar path & many unrefined aspects, is filled with brief moments that are absolutely thrilling.Set in Detroit, the story of 8 Mile concerns a young white rapper named Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith Jr. who's struggling with every aspect of his life & invites a lot of flak after choking at the local rap contest. The film covers his journey as he attempts to make the most of what could be his final chance to launch a rap career in a genre usually dominated by African Americans.Directed by Curtis Hanson & written by Scott Silver, the story is pretty generic considering it's the same underdog tale we've seen many times before but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable for the rap contests here are a treat to watch. There's nothing special about any of its technical aspects although Eminem does provide us with one of the greatest & most inspiring songs ever written.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Eminem, Mekhi Phifer, Brittany Murphy, Kim Basinger, Michael Shannon, Anthony Mackie & others. Eminem is actually quite convincing in his given role & is at his best during the film's final act. Murphy also manages to shine here, Phifer plays his role very well & so does Mackie, while Basinger & Shannon do a fine job in their supporting role.On an overall scale, 8 Mile is at its most entertaining during the rap battles but barely manages to hang along without those moments. The final act is what finishes the film on a high as seeing B-Rabbit completely decimate each n every one of his opponents is highly reminiscent of what Slim Shady did in real life & then to follow it up with Lose Yourself is an icing on the cake that shows why he's still The Undisputed King of Hip-Hop.

Shrek 2," Just As Much Fun & Entertaining As Its Predecessor, If Not More.
","Almost as enjoyable as its predecessor if not more, Shrek 2 may lack the freshness of the first film but it retains most of the elements that made Shrek such an all-round success. Making fab use of its new plot, setting & characters, it's a fun-filled ride that's well-capable of standing on its own.The story of Shrek 2 follows Shrek, Fiona & Donkey as they are invited by Fiona's parents to celebrate their marriage. Unaware that the newlyweds are both ogres, her parents try to hide their repulsion and have trouble getting along. Meanwhile, there is a plot being set up to destroy their relationship.Nicely written & directed, the sequel expands on the original's story and applies the same formula as before which results in a familiar wit but it carries a sharpness that makes majority of its gags work. The reprising characters still have a charm to them while the new ones are colourful & interesting in their own ways.The animation is richer in detail, more refined in rendition & offers a better vibrance to its frames. The plot isn't always compelling and hits a few snags in the middle but it also recovers sooner than expected. Voice actors, including new ones, chip in with excellent inputs, while the songs & score help keep its adventurous vibe alive.On an overall scale, Shrek 2 is another fascinating, entertaining & satisfying delight from DreamWorks Animation that will manage to amuse most of its viewers if not all.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Most Ideal Blend Of Quentin Tarantino's Filmmaking Trademarks.
","The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino arrived in two volumes and of all the films that this auteur has made in his filmmaking career, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 remains his most precise blend of riveting story, fascinating characters, pop culture references, wonderful homages & gripping action, all of which is seamlessly brought together by just the ideal incorporation of existing music, to deliver an immensely enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly fulfilling cinematic experience.Based on the character of 'The Bride' created by Q & U (as in Quentin & Uma), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 follows a former member of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who, while pregnant & about to marry, is brutally assaulted by her allies and falls into a comatose state. Waking up after 4 years & discovering that the baby in her womb is gone, this deadly assassin goes on a killing rampage to unleash vengeance upon the five people who destroyed her life & killed her child.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill is his homage to numerous film genres, like spaghetti westerns, kung fu flicks, Chinese wuxia, Japanese samurai cinema & even anime, and Vol.1 is simply a revenge bloodbath. The entire picture is expertly narrated from start to finish, makes excellent use of all his trademarks, and is jam-packed with compelling characters, each gifted with a distinct quality. From the beginning to the end, Vol. 1 is one bloody affair that comes loaded with both style & substance.Vol. 1 is covered in five chapters, each strong enough to stand on its own, and is engaging from the first frame to the last. A particular highlight is the anime sequence which provides the backstory of a prominent character and just about everything in it is perfectly executed. The set pieces are in accordance with the location where its plot is unfolding, even camera is exquisitely employed and makes splendid use of long takes, silhouette shots, greyscale photography, different angles & wide ranging colour tones.The action is highly stylised, brilliantly choreographed & goes totally bonkers in the blood- splattered sequence before the final showdown and is incredibly fun & amusing to look at. Editing splits the plot into five segments which is then narrated in non-chronological order yet the transition from one chapter to another is absolutely smooth. And finally there is the use of existing music to drive its story as well as viewers' emotions, and in my opinion, it's the best set of tracks Tarantino has put together plus it just works.Coming to the performances, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 features a terrific cast in Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Julie Dreyfus, Sonny Chiba, Chiaki Kuriyama, Vivica A. Fox & others, in addition to brief appearances from characters that are dealt with in Vol. 2. Leading from the front is Thurman as the Bride and it still remains her career-defining work for she's electrifying, charismatic & flamboyant in the given role. Liu plays O-Ren Ishii, the first on Bride's revenge list and chips in with fantastic performance while Kuriyama easily steals every moment she's present in.On an overall scale, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is the most harmonious blend of Tarantino's filmmaking trademarks and is a cinema that works on all levels. Although it only covers the first half of the Bride's blood-soaked revenge saga, it effectively paves the groundwork for the next in line, and succeeds as a standalone movie too. There isn't really much to complain about it for even its over-the-top action & exaggerated blood-filled violence only end up working in its favour and the film as a whole is a pure exemplification of a cinephile's own enthusiasm, passion & love for the cinematic medium.

Saw II," A Step Down In Quality But A Step Up In Extremity!
","A step down in quality but a step up in extremity, the follow-up chapter to James Wan's Saw may not be as impressive & gratifying on storytelling scale as its predecessor but it still succeeds as a worthy addition to the franchise that expands upon the premise of the original while exploring the backstory of the notorious serial killer, Jigsaw.The second instalment in the infamous series, Saw II finds Jigsaw being apprehended by the police but he points them towards a set of computer monitors that show several people trapped inside a house, and one among them is the arresting officer's son. With time running out quickly, this officer has no choice but to play his game if he wishes to see his kid again.Co-written & directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, this second chapter adopts the narrative style & visual design of the original but shifts a gear or two when it comes to the violence, gore & sadistic games. The plot is interesting, albeit a little far-fetched at times, and makes use of few flashbacks that covers our serial killer's backstory and briefly explains why he became Jigsaw.The booby traps are cleverly imagined although not all of them work out in the story's favour. Also making a surprise return is Jigsaw's only known survivor who's thrown into the game along with the rest. The performances aren't any good but Tobin Bell does leave a positive impression in his role while Charlie Clouser's score only gets more intense as the plot nears its conclusion.On an overall scale, Saw II lacks the freshness & compact structure of the original but attempts to make up for those shortcomings by levelling up its violence & other extremity elements. Although it's no instant classic like its predecessor, it nonetheless works as a fine entry in the series and will delight those who came here looking for some good old-fashioned torture & body mutilations.

Ip Man," One Of The Greatest Martial Arts Film Of All Time
","Martial arts in cinema generally have this tendency to go way over-the-top in its depiction. Some find that overly exaggerated action ridiculously fun while for others, it's plainly stupid. However, there are also a few examples out there that have captured this combat style in a very grounded manner while managing to stay within the laws of physics. And Ip Man is definitely one of those flicks.Ip Man is a semi-biographical account of the legendary Chinese martial artist Yip Man who popularised the Wing Chun fighting style but is best known around the world as the teacher of yet another Kung-fu legend, Bruce Lee. Set before & during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the plot covers the change brought in the peaceful life of the grandmaster & everyone around him in the city of Foshan after the Japanese invasion.Brilliantly directed by Wilson Yip, Ip Man is a highly character-driven story that's filled with some of the most amazing martial arts sequences ever put on the film canvas. It takes its action seriously, keeps it realistic to a considerable extent but also manages to mix a bit of humour in it, especially in the first half. One action scene definitely stands out & you'll know which one I'm talking about once you've seen it yourself.The script may not be an entirely authentic account of the grandmaster's life but the artistic license taken for dramatic effect never really deviates from what it's all about. Camera-work is expertly carried out, Editing provides a frenzy pace to the whole narrative, background score is beautifully composed & Donnie Yen is absolutely impeccable in the iconic role of Yip Man. In fact, of all the actors who've played that role before or after, he's the best at it.On an overall scale, Ip Man is one highly explosive, incredibly thrilling, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying cinema that's great enough to be ranked amongst the finest examples of its genre. It is wonderfully balanced in all departments of filmmaking, benefits hugely from Donnie Yen's committed performance & features regular moments of action that don't end up making a complete joke of its sacred combat style. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,14 October 2013
Jurassic World," As Disappointing As Indominus Rex!
","Stuck in development hell for over a decade & eventually brought to life in an effort to pay homage to the 1993 classic instead of rehashing the same formula of the inferior sequels, I have to say that I'm highly surprised by the way Jurassic World has ripped apart the global box-office records & is still continuing its strong run without any signs of slowing down.Its nod to Jurassic Park is commendable, its action-filled premise will keep the mainstream viewers entertained & its critical take on the corporate mentality is a welcome element but these are possibly the only positives in a film filled with a highly predictable storyline, clichÃ©-ridden dialogues, annoying characters, poorly designed dinosaurs, terrible acting & no sense of wonder or amazement.Set 22 years after the events of the first film, the story of Jurassic World takes place on the same island where now a fully functional dinosaur theme park has been in operation for 10 years. But due to a steady decline in attendance over the years, the team decides to unveil its latest attraction; a genetically modified hybrid. However, things soon spiral out of control when this new monster escapes from its enclosure.Directed by Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World is only his sophomore feature film & it's a huge responsibility, both in scope & expectations, for the movie is envisioned as a sequel as well as a possible resurrection of the dusted franchise. The new director does bring an interesting viewpoint that aims to revitalise the series without competing with the legacy of the original but he also fails in implementing that idea on the film canvas in a satisfying manner.The screenplay is another culprit for neither the plot nor the characters carry any depth, the dialogues are eye-rollingly cheesy, plus the story lacks any element of surprise & is way too predictable for it to be any fun. The technical aspects don't have anything new to offer here other than providing a slightly improved visual encapsulation. Isla Nublar is brought to life in splendid detail yet it seems to have more resemblance with a petting zoo than a dinosaur theme park.Cinematography impresses as well as disappoints at various moments for there are plenty of scenes that could've benefited from a different viewing angle and thanks to its continuously shifting focus, even its action sequences fail to make the desired impact. There's no proper set-up to any major sequences, the suspenseful mood is pretty much non-existent, and the extent to which product placement is infused into the whole narrative is maddening.Michael Giacchino's score also fails to provide an immersive experience and it is only when John Williams' iconic theme hits the screen that a deep sense of warmth & intense feelings of nostalgia are evoked. It's just amazing how inferior the visuals effects are in Jurassic World when compared to Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park or The Lost World. Even Jurassic Park III had more realistic-looking dinosaurs than this latest entry plus the CGI rendering isn't up to the mark either.Coming to the performances, the ensemble comprises of Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan & B.D. Wong, and each of them either underacts or overacts. Pratt dons his Indiana Jones suit to play the Velociraptor expert & trainer, Dallas Howard is busy hamming all the time, D'Onofrio's work is all over the place, Omar Sy exists for no reason, Khan's input is as viable as his works in other Hollywood flicks and the two child actors are as stupid as kids usually are.On an overall scale, Jurassic World is as disappointing a feature as I expected it to be after checking out its trailers and is no different from the usual mindless big-budget blockbusters that plague the silver screen at this time of the year. An absolutely flat cinematic experience that features lifeless characters, hollow dinosaur-action, no suspense, zero soul & while it isn't entirely a disaster, Jurassic World never for once comes close to capturing the unparalleled magic of Spielberg's timeless masterpiece.",Null,1,5,30 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," The Movie That Ushered The Era Of Found Footage Horror Flicks!
","Paranormal Activity is that indie chiller whose unexpected box-office success brought back found footage subgenre of horror into the mainstream and spawned an era that saw almost every horror film using the POV-shot technique green-lighted into production by the studio, whether it packs in a compelling story or not being one aspect that doesn't play any role. Paranormal Activity tells the story of a young couple who move into their new house in San Diego. When the girl confesses to her camera obsessed boyfriend that she's been haunted by a supernatural entity all her life, he sets up the camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that takes place while they sleep and ends up capturing many strange occurrences in the house.Written, co-produced, photographed, edited & directed by Oren Peli, Paranormal Activity is shot on a mere budget of $15000 and features a very simple premise, only two characters & vast amount of nothingness in its story but what really makes it work is the excellent use of silence & waiting to create an aura of tension as well as its greater emphasis on believability over action & gore.Filmed with a home video camera, the film's POV technique is nicely executed for the most part but also overused. Plenty of sequences have no reason for the camera to be there but since it's our only eye into these character's lives, the forced camera-work ends up making the guy character seem like a freak. The performances are amateur and the only thing worth watching in these dull characters' lives are those supernatural phenomena.On an overall scale, Paranormal Activity is a pretty decent horror flick that offers a couple of genuinely chilling moments, does a fascinating job in turning its limitations to its advantage, and is a fantastic debut feature for Oren Peli who did a commendable all-round job to bring it to life. While many consider it to be the picture that's solely responsible for revitalising the found footage subgenre of horror, Paranormal Activity never really adds anything new to the world of horror and its influence on the found footage flicks that followed has far more to do with its box-office performance than its content.",Null,0,0,2 October 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Another Lacklustre Entry In The Mission: Impossible Series.
","The second instalment of the Mission: Impossible series does offer a slight improvement in the narrative element for the convoluted mess of the previous chapter is replaced by a more conventional storyline but the thrilling action of the original certainly goes for a toss here as this sequel is plagued with slow-mo, over-the-top segments which look way too ridiculous.Mission: Impossible II finds IMF agent Ethan Hunt embarking on a new mission that requires him to go all the way to Sydney in order to retrieve n destroy the samples of a genetically- created disease called Chimera but he isn't the only one after it for a rogue IMF agent also covets the same to complete his grand scheme of infecting the world since he's already in possession of the disease's cure.Taking over the directional duties from Brian De Palma is the famous action filmmaker John Woo (known for Hard Boiled) and while he does bring his usual trademarks, including heavy use of slow-motion infused between its chaotic action sequences, he ends up overdoing it in the end. There are still some impressive moments though but once again the plot is short on substance & characters lack depth.Cinematography makes kinetic use of its camera but the use of slow-mo shots are way too many which after a while start frustrating, Editing finely paces the whole narrative, Special effects is highly impressive, Hans Zimmer also chips in with a fitting score but once again in the acting department, there isn't even one outstanding performance but the film certainly benefits from Tom Cruise's charismatic screen presence.On an overall scale, Mission: Impossible II is more or less the same as its predecessor for the very minute enhancement in its narration is unfortunately impaired by its absurd action sequences. While the film did look impressive at its time of release, its effect over the years has simply worn out and now it appears as lacklustre as the first entry in the series. Still, a fun, entertaining flick that can be easily enjoyed, and will possibly satisfy most if not all.",Null,0,1,21 July 2015
Cold War," A Stale & Soulless Story Of Cursed Love In Cursed Times
","From the Academy Award-winning director of Ida comes another cold, stark & emotionally distant feature, this time centred around a couple that can neither stay together nor live apart. Taking inspiration from his own parents' turbulent history, Pawel Pawlikowski's latest is a tale of cursed love in cursed times.Set in the ruins of post-war Europe, the story concerns a musical director who discovers a young singer and helps her refine her talent. The plot follows their romance over the years as their different backgrounds, varying temperaments & politics of the era keep separating them apart & bringing them back together.Co-written & directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, the film definitely benefits from its splendid camerawork & wonderful music but the romance aspect is both stale & soulless. Watching the same episode repeated time n again in different places & years gets old & boring real soon, plus we never even grow to care about them.The two lovebirds have no individual lives of their own. The story never digs into that aspect, for it only shows us the segments that brings them together before driving them apart again. And the repetitive nature of it makes sure that we are never invested in them or their relationship or the troubles they find themselves in over the years.Difficulties of living in exile or under totalitarian regime are only glimpsed at but never explored. Joanna Kulig & Tomasz Kot do well with what they are given and while their work looks impressive, it doesn't truly resonate on an emotional level. It's a good thing that the film is only 85 minutes long and ends before it becomes an ordeal to sit through.On an overall scale, Cold War is beautiful to look at but its story doesn't stimulate the senses the way its arresting imagery does. The frame composition, greyscale photography, crisp camerawork and excellent musical choices actually turned out to be its saving grace, for without them, this Polish drama would be no less than an absolute chore. In a word, underwhelming.",Null,40,56,3 December 2018
The Hangover Part II," The Hangover Part II --> The Hangover Minus Everything That's Good About It.
","Applying the same formula that made its predecessor one of the finest comedies of its year, The Hangover Part II is the follow-up chapter to The Hangover that brings nothing new to the table, is an absolutely uninspired sequel that tries too hard to amuse its audience, and fails at everything the original managed to get right in the first place.Set two years after the events of the first film, the story of The Hangover Part II follows Phil, Stu, Alan & Doug as this time they arrive in Thailand for Stu's wedding. In order to avoid the escapades of Las Vegas during their last bachelor party, Stu decides to play it safe by opting for a pre-wedding brunch but once again, things soon head in the unexpected direction.Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, The Hangover Part II completely lacks the freshness, originality & quality the first film had and even the use of humour is disappointing this time. The screenplay is a letdown too for the writers have simply taken the basic plot of the first film, set it at a new location & filled it up with whatever gags they could come up with without ever trying.The technical aspects share much similarity with the first chapter yet doesn't resonate the same vibe as before. Camera-work is bit more gritty than last time, Editing fails to get rid of many moments the final print could've done without, and the soundtrack isn't impressive at all. Even the performance by its reprising cast is inferior in comparison to their input in the previous chapter while the new additions are simply dull.On an overall scale, The Hangover Part II is a lazy, lethargic & lacklustre sequel to The Hangover that never really clicks at any given moment, and is nothing more than the same old stuff being sold in a new package. Every element that worked so well in the first film, whether it's the expert use of wit or creative energy or the seamless interplay between its characters, is sorely missing here and if you have seen the original, then you can certainly skip this one unless you are determined to find out what regret feels like!",Null,0,0,7 October 2013
A Bug's Life," A Bug's Life is A Little Insight Into How People At Pixar Work, Imagine, Create & Entertain Us.
","After dazzling everyone with its unforgettable debut that revolutionised the entire animation industry in the long run, Pixar Animation Studios' follow up to their highly revered Toy Story is another wonderful piece of imagination, innovation & animation that once again presents a unique take on life but this time from a bug's point of view.The story of A Bug's Life follows a misfit ant who thinks differently yet only ends up causing more trouble for his colony so when his latest escapade wastes away all the food ants had gathered to offer to the greedy grasshoppers, he decides to make up for it by finding & recruiting tough warrior bugs to save the entire colony from its oppressors.Directed by John Lasseter, A Bug's Life marks Pixar's second consecutive home-run & just like their previous feature, brims with so much creativity & passion that the narrative it puts on the silver screen remains finely balanced in storytelling department and is then taken to the next level by further refinement & advancement in their state-of-the-art animation.There are wide range of bugs to be found in this fable and the animators have done a fab job in envisioning, designing & rendering all of them. While none of its characters manage to be memorable, it's the sum of the parts that makes it click. The themes it deals with are nicely addressed, humour is effectively used, score is lightweight but fitting & it never loses its sense of fun.On an overall scale, A Bug's Life is definitely one of Pixar's most underrated films that may not have anything as memorable as the studio's best works but it nonetheless scores high marks in all filmmaking aspects to make up for an enjoyable & entertaining ride that viewers of all ages can benefit from plus delivers its message of 'strength in unity' with remarkable simplicity & effectiveness.In many ways, I find it to be a reflection of Pixar's very own modus operandi for it offers an interesting insight into the way these talented minds come together under one roof for the sole purpose of envisioning, creating & stringently refining stories that are fun & entertaining but also not devoid of heart, soul & emotions, with an added incentive to be able to do that without compromising with the art or quality of its medium.",Null,5,5,7 October 2013
Prisoners," An Intricate Thriller of Emotional & Moral Complexities.
","From the director of Incendies & Polytechnique, Prisoners is a very tensely crafted cinematic maze of intense emotions & moral complexities which with the help of its clever plot, intricate script, strong religious themes, ensemble cast & stellar performances creates a darkly disturbing & grim atmosphere of uncertainty that looms over its story from start to finish.It tells the story of Keller Dover, who is a deeply religious man & believes in being prepared for the worst at all times. But one day when his daughter & her friend go missing and the police fails to make any breakthroughs for days, Keller takes matters into his own hands & sets out to find his daughter by targeting the prime suspect for information before it's too late.Denis Villeneuve's direction here carries the very riddles & moral complications of his previous works and these elements eventually end up playing a major role in shaping up the whole experience of this film. Roger Deakins' cinematography is another standout as the entire film has a dark & mysterious ambiance enveloping it & even the sequences filmed in minimum light are able to retain a crisp clarity.Coming to the performances, Prisoners has a pretty reliable cast but it's Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal who end up impressing the most. Jackman plays Keller Dover; the grief-stricken father of the missing girl, & delivers an emotionally charged performance. But he is constantly challenged by Gyllenhaal who delivers a knockout performance as Detective Loki; the officer spearheading this perplexing case.On an overall scale, Prisoners is a labyrinth of moral & ethical ambiguities represented through the degeneration of an immensely faithful & God-fearing person into a remorseless sinner, all exhibited in a darkly compelling manner, and it's also an interesting focus on the devastating change an event like the one depicted in this film can bring in any parent out there.

Silence," A Divisive Work Of Art That Viewers Will Either Embrace Wholeheartedly Or Reject Outright
","I'd like to begin with a confession. The only Martin Scorsese films that I'm actually fond of are the ones starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role. A lot of his earlier works, especially the ones with Robert De Niro, are due for a rewatch but I vividly remember not liking any of them. His turn of the century flicks, however, have fared better on my radar but his latest isn't one of them.An ambitious & personal project that has been a long time coming, Silence finally makes its long overdue transition to the film canvas after being stuck in development hell for over 25 years and is a silent contemplation of faith & ideology that's skilfully layered with religious themes and crafted with perseverance, but the end result is still something that's overlong, tedious & frustrating to sit through.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Silence is set in 17th century Japan and follows two Jesuit priests who set out to locate their missing mentor after learning that he renounced his religion following prolonged torture. Setting foot in the nation where Christianity itself is outlawed, they find refuge in the local Christian population but face their ultimate test when they attempt to propagate Catholicism.Co-written & directed by Martin Scorsese, Silence is a historical piece that's beautifully shot from start to finish but is going to be an excruciating experience if you are not intrigued by its premise. Scorsese's direction bears all his trademarks, each sequence is shot with an auteur's eye, and the attention to detail in every segment plus the multitudes of themes beneath the surface only assist in enhancing its imagery.Production design team brings 17th century Japan to life in splendid detail and the exotic locations add a serene quality to it. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera, colour palette, lighting & angles to turn each frame into a gorgeous artwork and the static but fluid movements only help in making the whole journey all the more immersive while Music stays in the background & silently complements the narrative.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson & Tadanobu Asano, and all of them chip in with well-measured inputs. Garfield plays the Jesuit priest whose journey & struggle this tale is all about and although sloppy at first, his work does get better as the plot progresses. Driver does well with what he's given, Neeson dominates his moments with ease while Asano amazes the most.With a runtime of 161 minutes, Silence is no easy sit and the glacial pace at which its events unfold makes it all the more challenging but for those who can patiently connect with it, the film may turn out to be a spiritually fulfilling experience. While there are moments of pure brilliance that surface every now n then, the vast amount of nothingness in between turns the whole journey into one hell of a bore. Illuminating for some & infuriating for others, Martin Scorsese's passion project is one of those divisive works of art that audience will either embrace wholeheartedly or reject outright.",Null,0,2,23 January 2017
Logan," This Is What Great Cinema Looks Like. You Should Take A Moment. Feel It. Cherish It.
","Not only the best X-Men film made to date but impressive enough to garner a spot amongst the greatest works of its genre, Hugh Jackman's swan song to his signature character is a rarity in modern superhero filmmaking that subverts the genre tropes by blending the gritty, violent & bleak ruggedness of westerns with the silent rumination of a hard-hitting, powerfully captivating & emotionally dense drama, and delivers a cinema so fresh, unique & groundbreaking that it ultimately transcends its genre.",Null,3,8,12 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," An Overblown, Overcrowded & Convoluted Mess!
","What actually made The Avengers click so amazingly well with audience around the globe wasn't its simple accumulation of many superheroes in one feature but the flawless manner in which director Joss Whedon blended the elements of action, humour & drama into one perfectly balanced extravaganza that offered plenty of laughs, spectacle, emotions, entertainment & satisfaction throughout its runtime.Riding on the wonderful platform provided to it by earlier instalments, the second phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe has had a smooth run in both critical & commercial departments until it all came down to the chapter everyone had been waiting for since the past 3 years. And even although at first Avengers: Age of Ultron may seem like another success story for Marvel, it is unfortunately way too messed up in actuality.Sequel to The Avengers, penultimate chapter of Marvel's Phase Two plan & eleventh film in Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Age of Ultron brings back the team of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow & Haweye under one roof once again for this time they face an adversary they never saw coming as Tony Stark's dormant peacekeeping program goes horribly wrong, resulting in the birth of Ultron who's hellbent on human extinction.Written & directed by Joss Whedon, almost all the things that one suspected to go wrong in The Avengers goes wrong in this sequel as Age of Ultron is an overblown, overcrowded & extremely convoluted mess of an action-adventure that neither succeeds in finding the perfect balance between its different elements nor provides a smooth flow to its narrative like the way it did in its predecessor. And even his direction looked tiresome as if he simply wanted to finish the film anyhow & go home.While the story does head into a darker territory this time, adds greater depth to the arcs of subordinate members of the Avengers & brims with cleverly executed moments of wit, it's the complete lack of coherence that hurts this film most. The heaviness of the opening act, the nonsensical incarnation of Ultron, the over-reliance on CGI action, the uneven switching between different plot points & several wrong turns that ultimately lead to an uninspiring finale are a few things that negatively affect the whole experience.The writing is another culprit for the new characters are poorly handled, the plot line is quite banal, the action is soulless and although the screenplay boasts a few interesting ideas on paper, its execution on the film canvas is an absolute disappointment. Camera-work is pretty chaotic but the visual look is commendable, Editing is bothersome for the story isn't supposed to be this long n tiresome, and even the background score is simply a rehash of the original that brings nothing new to the table.Coming to the performances, there isn't really much to add about the reprising cast except for the characters of Scarlett Johansson & Jeremy Renner, as we find out more about their backgrounds. Among the new additions, James Spader plays Ultron & even if his voice brings a compelling quality to his character, its poor conception in the script prevents him from becoming a formidable villain while Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Elizabeth Olsen do a fine job in the role of Quicksilver & Scarlet Witch, respectively.On an overall scale, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a disappointing follow-up to The Avengers that collapses under the burden of its own ambitions in a spectacular fashion. Even though it never advertised itself as anything more than a popcorn entertainer but it is only sensible to expect a sequel that's on the same radar as its predecessor. I don't know if it's the after- effects of Mad Max: Fury Road that had me totally numb to the CGI-heavy sequences this film had in store or if those moments really are lifeless but purely from storytelling aspect, Avengers: Age of Ultron certainly isn't one of Marvel's finest offerings.",Null,12,24,24 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," One Of The Most Amusing Comedies Of Its Year

When a human inadvertently checks into the 'no-human' hotel, Dracula has to keep him hidden from the guests & also protect his daughter from falling in love with the mortal.While the narrative here isn't even close to Pixar-level stuff, Hotel Transylvania makes up for what it lacks in the storytelling department with plethora of fascinating characters who are very much alive n kicking, plus the slapstick humour is brilliantly handled throughout its runtime & offers plenty of laughs for kids n adults alike. And the animation is worthy of appreciation as well for it looks incredibly rich, detailed & gorgeously rendered.On an overall scale, Hotel Transylvania is one of the most amusing comedies of its year that features a very simple plot that never takes itself seriously for the most part, is filled with characters that are colourful & fun to be around, nicely parodies many horror films of past n present, and is an amusing family feature that may leave few slightly disappointed in the storytelling department but purely from the entertainment perspective, it's wild, joyful & hilarious as hell.

Hotel Mumbai," As Intense & Thrilling As It Is Misguided & Exploitative
","As intense & thrilling as it is misguided & exploitative, Hotel Mumbai dramatises the events of 2008 Mumbai terror attack that crippled India's financial capital & left over hundreds of people dead in its wake before culminating at the famous Taj Mahal Palace Hotel after a 4-day siege. The film captures the horrors of 26/11 with unflinching brutality however a few characters it opts to foreground is rather problematic.Touted as a true story of humanity & heroism, Hotel Mumbai recounts the siege of the famed Taj Hotel by a group of terrorists in Mumbai, India that occurred on 26 November 2008. The plot focuses on the staff members who perform above & beyond the call of duty by making unthinkable sacrifices to keep their guests safe until help arrives, and also concerns a desperate couple who take grave measures to protect their newborn child.Co-written & directed by Anthony Maras in what's his directorial debut, it's a good start to his filmmaking journey as the film retains its tense atmosphere from start to finish, and is a competently crafted thriller. But his inexperience is also why the graphic violence seems excessive & repetitive as if existing only for shock value, in addition to his struggle with what characters to keep at the forefront, for so many of them & their subplots were unnecessary.The first act is where Hotel Mumbai is at its best & most effective. The production design team's recreation of the interior of Taj Palace is impressive to say the least. Editing only worsens as plot progresses. Pacing also falters in the middle portion. Performances from most are serviceable at best, with Dev Patel delivering better input than the rest. And also worthy of mention is the background score that ably heightens the film's grim mood & foreboding aura with its brooding tracks.On an overall scale, Hotel Mumbai does get a few things right, and is a well-made example of its genre but for those who witnessed this horrifying tragedy from up close, it is only going to open old wounds. It never for once feels like a tribute to the staff who risked their own lives to protect their guests and unfolds more like a fictional thriller with heavy body counts made purely for entertainment purposes which still would've been fine if it was by all means fictional. But it's not. I can see why some may love it but I'm definitely not one of them.",Null,3,9,20 June 2019
Everest," An Empty Spectacle That Fails To Take The Advantage Of Its Massive Canvas!
","It is really a shame that despite featuring a star-studded cast placed in a highly dangerous environment where anything could go wrong anytime, where the element of unpredictability is high, and where tension can be created in the simplest of scenes, Everest simply fails to create such nail-biting moments and for the most part, is nothing but an empty spectacle.Based on the 1996 disastrous expedition to scale Mount Everest, Everest follows Rob Hall; the leader of an expedition team whose task is to guide his clients to the summit of Mount Everest and bring them back safely. The plot covers the adventure he & his group embarks on and the devastating turn it takes when a severe snow storm hits them on their way back.Directed by Baltasar Kormákur, Everest could have been so much more with the resources its plot provided but isn't thanks to mediocre direction. The film takes so much time to get us acquainted to its characters and yet the characterisation remains poor and is evident in scenes when their life is at stake. At times, the writers try too hard to make the viewers feel for these people but it just doesn't work.The technical aspects are a mishmash of impressive & absurd work. Set pieces are refined & detailed while the shooting locations bring an authenticity of its own. Cinematography is arresting when it comes to landscape photography, colour tones are smartly utilised but it fails to enhance the action in any way. Its 121 minutes of runtime feels a tad too long. VFX is expertly carried out while the background score is absolutely useless.Coming to the performances, Everest features a fine cast in Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, John Hawks, Emily Watson, Keira Knightley, Robin Wright, Sam Worthington & Michael Kelly and yet there isn't one performance that leaves its mark. Clarke still lacks the charisma to lead a film on his own, Gyllenhaal does well with what he's given, Brolin is very much wasted, Worthington has no idea what he's doing here, Watson is fine while Wright & Knightley don't have much to contribute.On an overall scale, Everest could have been one of the best survival films to surface on the silver screen in recent years but thanks to basic direction & lazy writing, it falls very short of what it went out to achieve. With so many characters inhabiting this disaster story, it sucks that not even one manages to strike a chord as the film fails to capture the very excitement & danger of a larger-than-life voyage like this. Entertaining in bits n pieces, photographed in splendid detail but lacking the element that makes a good movie great, Everest is unable to take the advantage of its massive canvas and is more or less a disappointment.",Null,0,0,23 November 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Arguably The Weakest Harry Potter Film.
","After the truly magical Prisoner of Azkaban & darkly fascinating Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix arrives as the fifth instalment in the 8-film series based on the novels by J.K. Rowling. And while its source material was the longest in the series, the movie is surprisingly short. And not just that, the film in itself is a major step down as the narration & presentation never really clicked this time.Order of the Phoenix covers Harry Potter's 5th year at Hogwarts where he finds himself rebuffed by most as they refuse to believe his or Dumbledore's account that Lord Voldemort has returned. With the Ministry plotting to keep things under the table & assigning one of their own into Hogwarts' staff, Harry experiences one of his toughest years at the school while The Dark Lord desperately covets a secret weapon he didn't have the last time.For a while in the Harry Potter franchise, the director's chair seemed just as jinxed as the Defence Against the Dark Arts post for we have David Yates taking over that role from Mike Newell. And Yates direction turns out to be really out of place as the film neither has the darkness nor the excitement of its predecessors. The screenplay leaves out exceptional amount of detail from the story & what's adapted isn't transitioned properly on the silver screen.The technical aspects are a step down as well in comparison to the previous two chapters, at least. It looks remarkably average in every department, except the performances which I will talk about next. And even the score by Nicholas Hooper doesn't manage to evoke any sort of feeling. Still there are few moments that's well captured & captivating but for the majority of its runtime, Order of the Phoenix remains very stale & adds nothing special to the franchise.As for the performances, the recurring cast has put their strong foot forward while the new additions are simply amazing. From the recurring cast, Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) & Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) are the standouts. Amongst the new cast, Evanna Lynch is bloody perfect as Luna Lovegood & so is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. And Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge manages to make viewers hate her quite effortlessly.On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix has moments of highs & lows and manages to entertain in bits n pieces but it still feels highly inferior when compared to how much the last two sequels contributed to the saga. It was headed for a disaster but manages to correct itself by some extent during its third act. What I love most about it is obviously Luna & Bellatrix and if only the story was as intriguing as these two characters, then Order of the Phoenix today would've been hailed as the series' finest.

","Making history at the rate of 24 frames per second throughout its 81 minutes of runtime, Pixar Animation Studios' feature film debut is one of the greatest filmmaking achievements that didn't just transform the entire animation industry with its groundbreaking computer animation but also set a whole new standard for its genre with its inventive storytelling, thus instantly cementing its place in the annals of cinema.The first fully computer-animated feature-length film in cinema history, Toy Story follows the adventures of a group of toys that belong to a young kid named Andy but mainly focuses on the relationship between Andy's long-time favourite toy Woody; a cowboy doll & his latest birthday gift that turns out to be Buzz Lightyear; an action figure who's unaware that he's a toy but nevertheless threatens Woody's long-held position.Directed by John Lasseter, Toy Story introduces its animation studio on a grand note for it brims with originality, creativity, imagination, passion & innovation from start to finish and marks the biggest leap for its medium since Walt Disney's Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs surfaced on the film canvas back in 1937. But what makes it one of the best animated films of all time is its seamless blend of sophisticated storytelling with state-of-the-art animation.The screenplay is a gem in itself too for the plot is tightly knitted, makes excellent use of wit & is inhabited by a colourful set of characters who exhibit a stunning level of depth in their respective arcs. Its make-believe world is extremely convincing, the references n homages it makes to earlier classics is tastefully carried out, the relationship between kids & their toys is nailed to perfection and it also manages to convey its themes with effortless finesse.Adding more heart n soul to its characters are the talented voices behind it spearheaded by Tom Hanks & Tim Allen who infuse life into Woody & Buzz Lightyear respectively plus their on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic. Cinematography is expertly carried out, pacing is very brisk for the film never loses momentum & keeps getting better as plot progresses while Randy Newman's music instills an immense feeling of joy, warmth & wonder with its adventurous tracks.And then of course there is the revolutionary 3D animation that marked the dawn of a new era in animation which soon went on to completely re-invent its medium. It may not look as spellbinding today as it did back in 1995 but its influence on film, technology, video games & even computer graphics ever since cannot be understated, nor can be denied the role it played in the rise of new animation studios which ultimately put its medium in the same league that other genres have enjoyed since long.On an overall scale, Toy Story is a magical blend of kinetic direction, smart screenplay, rich characters, ideal voice cast, dynamic camera-work, terrific editing & heartwarming score that's freshly envisioned, ingeniously composed & gorgeously animated. A masterwork of jaw-dropping quality refined to perfection that triumphs in all aspects, Toy Story marks a significant moment in cinema for it marks the arrival of what would later become arguably the most acclaimed as well as critically & commercially excelling film studio of our time.",Null,0,0,7 October 2013
Midsommar," Midsommar (Director's Cut) Is Better Than The Theatrical Version
","The following is the review of Midsommar (Director's Cut).After terrifying everyone with his ominous directorial debut, easily amongst the scariest films of the decade, Ari Aster returned with an original & audacious folk horror about grief, trauma, family, toxic relationships & paganism. And although his second film wasn't as nerve-rattling as his first, it was still a very uncomfortable, unsettling & unnerving horror that established him as one of the boldest new filmmakers out there.However, it is only after watching Midsommar restored with all the segments that were edited out to improve the film's commercial value does one realise the real masterpiece that Ari Aster's sophomore feature is. Clocking at 171 minutes, the director's cut doesn't modify the plot structure but instead provides additional richness & cohesiveness to the story that makes the overall experience far more fulfilling & complete.While there are a couple extended scenes here that the film was better without, most of the new sequences add considerable weight & emotional wallop to Dani & Christian's relationship conflict, thus making the finale much more cathartic & satisfying. Add to that, an additional ritual of the HÃ¥rga festival featured in this latest cut also provides a closure to the final fate of a character who mysteriously disappeared.Sewing new threads into an existing fabric in a manner that enriches the texture & quality of the whole tapestry by a considerable extent, Midsommar (Director's Cut) is a definite improvement in every conceivable way, and should be the only version available to viewers. Its almost 3-hour long runtime may seem daunting but the narrative flow & pacing feels much smoother & breezier, and expertly ties up all the loose ends.In short, Midsommar (Director's Cut) is an undeniably better, darker, powerful, haunting & rewarding picture than the theatrical version, and is Ari Aster's folk horror in its true, original & undiluted form. Strongly recommended.",Null,1,4,31 October 2019
Singin' in the Rain," The Greatest Musical Ever Made? Hell Yeah!
","Reflecting state-of-the-art quality in every filmmaking aspect, jam-packed with wonderful songs, amazing choreography & exquisite use of humour, and depicting the often frustrating process of getting accustomed to something completely new, Singin' in the Rain is the story of a silent film production company which, along with its cast, makes a difficult transition to sound.To be honest, I'm not really a fan of musicals. In fact, I despise live-action musicals but this film has so much charm, charisma & laughter that it manages to make itself work extremely well for the majority of its runtime. Directed by Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen, the film is a hilarious ride from start to finish & puts on screen some of the most exhausting dance sequences ever filmed.The technical aspects deserve a mention too as cinematography includes many moments of long single-takes, fluid camera movements & perfectly captured shots, editing concisely paces the whole story without ever letting any boredom to set in, although that Broadway sequence did feel out of place & unnecessary to me. And last but not the least, many of its songs are instantly catchy & memorable.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds & Jean Hagen, and although Gene & Debbie no doubt share a great on-screen chemistry here, it's Donald O'Connor who ends up impressing the most for he was an absolute show-stealer in every scene and his highly energetic performance easily overshadowed everything else, including Gene Kelly's magnetic work both on & off the screen.On an overall scale, Singin' in the Rain is hailed by many as the greatest musical to come out from Hollywood & I wholeheartedly agree. It certainly has every ingredient that makes a movie great & despite my initial lack of excitement or expectations, it turned out to be such an incredibly fun, hilarious & enjoyable cinematic ride that I'm going to cherish it for a long time. Don't miss it.",Null,0,1,16 August 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," A 4-hour Long Disappointment
","Reviewing this film is somewhat difficult because it's neither like the usual crime epics nor like any of the films that director Sergio Leone has made before, including his classic westerns. Running at nearly 4-hours of excessive runtime, Once Upon a Time in America failed terribly in living up to my expectations and turned out to be a major disappointment. The story begins brilliantly but then goes on for over 3 hours covering themes of friendship, greed, betrayal, love & loss in a painfully slow manner that was far less absorbing & more frustrating only to wrap itself up in the end with an ambiguous but fruitless conclusion.While the slow pace did give a huge amount of extra time for character development, there came many moments in the story when I just wanted it to end. There wasn't a single character worth liking in the film, the performances by Robert De Niro & others were good but there was nothing great about them, visually the film is beautiful in parts & music by Ennio Morricone has seen much better days, to be honest. Maybe a revisit sometime in the future might change my opinion about it but as of now, Once Upon a Time in America feels like a punishment for the crime I didn't commit & isn't even close to Sergio Leone's other classics.",Null,5,16,14 October 2013
Taken," Taken Works Solely Because Of Liam Neeson's Stellar Performance.
","Marking the dawn of a new era in Liam Neeson's acting career by reinventing his image and establishing him as a capable & charismatic action film star, Taken is a purely generic action thriller that's filled with all the known elements of action filmmaking, and has nothing new to offer but thanks to Neeson's stellar performance, it still makes up for a damn good ride.The story of Taken follows a retired CIA agent named Bryan Mills who's trying to strengthen his relationship with his estranged daughter who's leaving for Paris with her best friend. But when both of them are kidnapped by human traffickers for sex slavery, Mills is compelled to go after the kidnappers and relies on his old skills to track them down before it's too late.Co-written by Luc Besson & directed by Pierre Morel, Taken wastes no time in setting up its plot and once it gets going, it doesn't stop until the very end. The direction is slick, script is almost always focused on its lead character, its moments of action definitely benefit from its kinetic camera-work, while its tight editing makes sure that the narrative unfolds at a frenetic pace.Coming to the performances, Taken is Liam Neeson's show all the way for the actor returns to form in grand style and delivers a swashbuckling performance which, despite being over- the-top at several instances, resonates a charm of its own for Neeson is believable as both an merciless assassin & a protective father. Other than him however, the supporting cast is dull & don't have much to contribute.On an overall scale, Taken may not feature any moment that any action fanatic hasn't seen before but watching Liam Neeson beat everyone to a pulp is something that turns out to be refreshing & rewarding at the same time. Stylishly crafted, fiercely paced & elevated to new heights by Neeson's impressive input, Taken is an unexpected surprise & an undeniable fun flick that lives up to its cult status. Definitely worth a shot.",Null,1,1,14 October 2013
The Mummy Returns," A Worthy Sequel To The Mummy
","Making effective use of the very same ingredients that made its predecessor a surprise success, The Mummy Returns is a worthy follow-up to The Mummy that brings slight improvements in almost all filmmaking departments to provide its viewers another hell of a rollicking adventure that stays true to the original while also being more entertaining this time.Set 10 years after the events of the first film, the story of The Mummy Returns brings back Rick & Evelyn O'Connell, along with their son Alex, against the High Priest Imhotep who has again risen from the dead but this time is looking for the Bracelet of Anubis in order to gain control of The Scorpion King's army, thus once again endangering the fate of all mankind.Written & directed by Stephen Sommers who returns to the franchise he created with more action, humour & fun sequences and does a wonderful job at it. The premise is light-hearted as expected but the improvements are very much noticeable in visual effects, music, set pieces & few performances if not in writing which lack the freshness that the original had.On an overall scale, The Mummy Returns is a welcome addition to The Mummy franchise that builds upon the foundation laid by the first chapter to succeed as another lively, cheerful & highly enjoyable extravaganza and does enough to satisfy most fans of the original. Once again not meant to be taken seriously, this adventurous sequel is almost as good as its predecessor, if not better.",Null,1,1,7 October 2013
Avatar," Don't Miss AVATAR at any cost. It'll be years before we have a movie experience like this again.
","12 years ago, James Cameron had a vision of Avatar in mind. A vision so ahead of its time that Cameron shelved his project in order to wait for the technology to catch up. A vision so imaginative & exciting that he, finally, went on to create the much needed technology on his own. And the end result was NOT disappointing at all. Avatar takes film-making technology to a whole new level & sets a new standard in 3D viewing. It's a milestone in the history of the art.Avatar tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following his orders & protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism & biodiversity. Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. So, watch it in 3D cinemas only if you really want to experience the breathtaking vision of Cameron's world.Director James Cameron has, once again, broken all boundaries & created a visual extravaganza, thus, in the process, announcing his return which just couldn't have been better. From Terminator to Aliens to The Abyss to Terminator 2 to Titanic & now Avatar, the entertainment scope is getting wider & wider with every Cameron's film without compromising at all with the quality. The attention he has given to the detail is superb. Not only Cameron created a whole new world with its flora & fauna of exceptional beauty, he went on to create the culture, race & language of the Na'vi too & their love for their surroundings. They are to Pandora what humans are to Earth. Only difference being our ignorance to our surroundings.Avatar isn't an exceptional movie, overall. When it comes to plot, performances or dialogs, its a disappointment. Those things are no match to Cameron's previous works; Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2 & even Titanic. The reason behind Avatar breaking every box-office records lies in the beauty of Avatar that's drawing people to theaters again & again. The unforgettable experience in 3D viewing, the dead-end beauty of Pandora, the never-seen-before film-making technology & much satisfying entertainment overall are all responsible for its grand success. It has started the change. It has set things in motion. Cinema is getting revolutionized. Almost every movie is going 3D these days because of Avatar. Still, none have been able to recreate that same magic or experience. That's why, Avatar is way ahead of it's time.Now, let's come to the strong points of Avatar. It lies in its visual effects, editing & cinematography. Editing, like any Cameron movie, is brilliant. The cinematography brings us closer to the beautiful environment, the exotic creatures & incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora. Those who watched it in 3D knows how heartwarming the feeling was to find yourself in the flora & fauna of Pandora. However, the backbone of Avatar is its visual effects. Groundbreaking from scene 1, it's not the surroundings but the details of the surroundings because of which Visual Effects of Avatar reached new heights. World's 2 greatest visual effects studios, ILM & Weta Digital, worked together to produce this gem, and the results are wonderful. The attention in detailing & the magnitude scale of Pandora are sure to leave viewers jaw-dropped. Just the detailing on the face of a Na'vi is enough to tell you about the dedication involved in its making.Technically, Avatar is a breakthrough in film-making technology, 3D viewing & stereoscopic film-making with camera being designed specifically for the movie. If one looks at the story, it isn't that bad too. Of course not the best or even among the best, but still, it has all elements of entertaining the general audience of the world & that's what this movie is doing right now. At least, James Cameron knows how to invest and properly use the massive budget of this movie, unlike Michael Bay(Transformers 1 n 2) or Roland Emmerich(2012, Godzilla etc) who rely only on VFX & nothing else. At least, Avatar scores pretty well above them. It tells a fine story & let VFX n SFX take this movie to new heights.James Horner collaborated with James Cameron for the 3rd time (after Titanic & Aliens) & no doubt, has given a brilliant soundtrack yet again. The score is not as epic as Titanic but is still excellent for a sci-fi film. The score is really beautiful & succeeds in creating the music culture for the alien race. The beauty of the music of Avatar blends well with the beauty of Pandora. James Horner has done a fantastic job.Also, the story or screenplay of Avatar won't make it to the great lists. So, its better you go without expecting a quality plot & screenplay from this movie but a feast for the eyes. And make sure you watch Avatar in 3D for an all new experience. You won't regret it. Missing Avatar would be like missing a turning point in cinema. So be a part of it.10/10 for Avatar's beauty & the wonderful experience I had in theater.",Null,37,61,19 January 2010
Toy Story 2," A Worthy Sequel To A Landmark Motion Picture.
","After dazzling the world with its groundbreaking debut feature & following it up with another imaginative story, Pixar Animation Studios' third feature film finds them returning to the very story & characters that made its studio a household name. Considered by many to be one of those rare sequels that outshines its predecessor, Toy Story 2 keeps alive Pixar's winning streak and is as inventive, entertaining & fun as the original Toy Story.Continuing the adventures of Andy's toys, Toy Story 2 begins with Woody being stolen by a vintage toy collector & owner of 'Al's Toy Barn' who brings him to his apartment where he meets Jessie, Bullseye & Stinky Pete and learns that he's a valuable collectible based on a 1950s TV show. On the other hand, Buzz Lightyear devises a plan to rescue Woody from his captor & enlists the help of Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog & Rex.Directed by John Lasseter, Toy Story 2 opens on an impressive note with a visually striking sequence that instantly showcases the various improvements Pixar had made in computer animation, only to follow it up with a few more breakthroughs as the plot progresses. The 3D animation is far more refined, colour composition is accurate to a greater degree & while the characters retain their original design, they're rendered in a more seamless manner.Screenplay is fabulously written for the team behind it delivers a story that's as interesting, witty & original as its predecessor. Cinematography makes more dynamic use of camera as well as colour palettes, images are sharper & finely detailed than before, Editing is brilliantly carried out for the most part & steadily paces the narrative but its middle act could've used a few more trims. And Randy Newman keeps the story fresh, alive & energetic with another fantastic score.Reprising their respective roles from the last film, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen & others once again step up to voice their characters with sublime effectiveness while out of the new additions, it's Joan Cusack who leaves the most lasting impression with her exuberant take on Jessie. Its homage to earlier classics is wonderfully carried out, the themes are nicely addressed & although it employs the same out-of-box thinking that made Toy Story a historic success, everything about this sequel feels fresh, new & redesigned.On an overall scale, Toy Story 2 is another fascinating blend of a heartfelt story, rich set of characters & cutting-edge animation from Pixar that's ingeniously directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, firmly edited & mesmerisingly scored and is a work of quality filmmaking that sets a new benchmark for sequels in animation. While Toy Story is superior in my opinion, Toy Story 2 still manages to be a worthy follow-up to its predecessor & is another timeless classic from the animation studio that has always dared to think differently.",Null,1,2,7 October 2013
Chariots of Fire," A Slow-Burner That's Not For Every Viewer!
","Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Chariots of Fire is a patiently crafted, elegantly told & beautifully scored cinema that resonates a lot of passion, patriotism & heart throughout its runtime, and despite having the appearance of a sports film, it works more as a story about human nature than a full-fledged sports drama.Chariots of Fire tells the story of two young British sprinters who are chosen to represent Great Britain in the 1924 Olympics. While one of them is a Jew who runs to prove his worth & overcome prejudice, the other is a devout Christian who sees running as his own way of glorifying God. The plot covers their journey as they prepare for the biggest challenge of their life.Directed by Hugh Hudson, Chariots of Fire translates its true story on the silver screen with care & composure and does benefit from its evergreen cinematography, good performances from its entire cast and Vangelis' classic soundtrack but what hurts the picture is its glacial pace for the story feels much longer than it actually is and is filled with moments that overstay its welcome.On an overall scale, Chariots of Fire is a story about determination, professionalism, patriotism, sportsmanship & religion which also examines the elements true champion are forged of but despite getting many things right, it is unfortunately marred by its frustratingly slow pace and restrained approach and isn't as fulfilling as expected but despite its snail pace, this slow burner manages to get past the finish line with some fuel left in its tank.",Null,0,0,15 October 2013
Drag Me to Hell," A Unique Blend Of Startling Horror & Ludicrous Comedy That Actually Works.
","After freeing himself from the exhausting production schedule of big-budget blockbusters while he was working on those Spider-Man movies for nearly a decade, director Sam Raimi returns to a less hectic, low-budget & much simpler project and carves a thrilling mix of horror & comedy that's as jumpy as it is ludicrous.Drag Me to Hell tells the story of a bank loan officer who, in order to convince her boss that she is perfectly capable of making the tough decisions, refuses to grant loan extension to an old woman who, in retaliation, places a deadly curse on her. As the supernatural forces begin to torment her, she turns to a seer for help.Co-written & directed by Sam Raimi, the film delivers the shocks & laughs in equal doses and while the scares are spine-tingling, their impact is instantly doused by the absurdity of what follows next. Raimi clearly had a lot of fun while crafting this feature and the campy tone is evident in every frame. And if that wasn't enough, there are enough moments to simply gross its viewers out.I mean, every now n then, stuff keeps going in or coming out of people's mouth from start to finish. Characters aren't that well-defined but they are still serviceable. Technical aspects work in tandem to encapsulate the whole picture with a tense & unnerving atmosphere. Jump scares are effective, laughs are plentiful, and the slightly exaggerated performances from its cast only contributes to its wicked tone.On an overall scale, Drag Me to Hell is one of those rare entities that scores high in both horror & comedy aspects, finds its filmmaker in a much-relaxed yet creatively active mode, and is almost as frightening as it is funny. Its climax takes things a tad too far and pretty much kills all the suspense but it still manages to end on a satisfying note. In short, this unique hybrid of frights & laughter is a hellacious ride that actually works. Delightfully recommended.",Null,2,3,27 August 2016
Selma," A Huge Career Leap For Actor David Oyelowo & Director Ava DeVernay
","Keeping in view the current incidents surrounding the Ferguson protests which has once again escalated the racial tensions in the United States, the timing & arrival of Selma couldn't have been more apt. Not because it brings any solution to the present unrest situation but brilliantly demonstrates just how far we still remain from an ideal society that treats everyone as equal, no matter what their race, colour or creed is.Set in the titular city of Alabama state in 1965, the story of Selma concerns events surrounding the Voting Rights Movement carried out by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. & his organisation which ultimately led to the famous protest march from Selma to Montgomery as an exhibition of black American citizens' desire to be allowed their constitutional right to vote, that was granted later that year with the passing of Voting Rights Act.Directed by Ava DuVernay, Selma is crafted with meticulous care & passion, focuses on one event that became a landmark achievement of the 1960s America Civil Rights Movement and through that, successfully captures Dr. King's vision, tactics, political skills & even flaws. Set pieces nicely recreate the timeline its story is set in, Camera-work is brilliantly carried out, Editing works for the most part & its background score only gets better as the film progresses.Coming to the performances, Selma features a highly committed cast in David Oyelowo, Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey & others, and all of them have done a fabulous job in their given roles. But spearheading the acting department is Oyelowo who is absolutely brilliant, charming & believable in the role of the legendary civil rights leader and it's a shame that his revelatory performance was completely sidelined by the Academy.On an overall scale, Selma is an impressive piece of history filmmaking that's very gripping when all its elements are balancing each other yet there are few instances where its narrative feels dramatically stale & could've used a few more trims. Although by no means a truly great picture, Selma still makes up for an essential viewing thanks to Oyelowo's commanding lead performance & DuVernay's passionate direction and does a fascinating job in honouring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",Null,1,2,16 February 2015
The Artist," A Vintage Tour That Guarantees To Put A Smile On Every Cinema Lover's Face.
","Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Artist is an awe-inspiring ode to the silent era of cinema and is filmed with such fine elegance & precision artistry that it was too difficult for me to wipe the smile off my face while watching it. An enthralling work of indelible charm, every frame of this silent feature pays its tribute in the most respectful manner possible but also succeeds in carving out its very own identity in the process.Set in Hollywood during the years when talkies were being introduced into cinema, The Artist focuses on the relationship between a major silent film star & an aspiring young actress who bump into each other during the premiere of the former's latest film. But when their production house decides to do away with silent films & usher in the new era of sound, the career of these two actors turns upside down as one heads for ruin, while other rises to stardom.Written & directed by Michael Hazanavicius, The Artist opens in the same manner like films of that era used to & it even feels like you're watching a feature from that golden period. Paying attention to the smallest of details, it's an intriguing look at how production was carried out in those days, and if the excellence in the production design wasn't enough, its two lead actors manage to take it to a whole new level with their expressive & energetic performances.Coming to the technical aspects, cinematography captures the whole picture in the same aspect ratio & frame rate as was standard in 1920s, black-n-white photography has a vintage feel to it, the first half of the film is exquisitely paced while the second half stumbles a little but makes a sharp return in its final moments to culminate on a high with a memorable final shot, and Ludovic Bource's background score wonderfully captures the era this story is set in.As far as performances go, both Jean Dujardin & Bérénice Bejo are a revelation in their respective roles of silent film star, George Valentin & aspiring actress, Peppy Miller. With no words to speak on camera plus complete reliance on body language & facial expressions, the two actors make their characters work stunningly well & even share a sizzling chemistry together. Of the two leads however, I liked Bejo's work much more than Dujardin's.On an overall scale, succeeding not only as a marvellous silent film but also a heartfelt drama with romance at its heart & nostalgia written all over it, The Artist is a skilfully executed cinematic feat from a passionate filmmaker who admires the beauty & art of a bygone era, and is a triumph in all filmmaking departments. Definitely one of the best films of its year & absolutely deserving of all its accolades, The Artist comes as a must for every cinema lover out there.",Null,3,5,9 August 2013
Mission: Impossible," Mission: Impossible Is Nearly Impossible To Follow!
","One of the most popular films of the 1990s that catapulted Tom Cruise into the league of Hollywood's biggest stars, Mission: Impossible is an intriguing, entertaining & seemingly engaging spy-thriller that packs in enough action spectacle to satisfy its viewers but also suffers due to its convoluted premise, illogical twists & unfleshed characters.The story of Mission: Impossible follows Ethan Hunt; the point man of a secret government agency who's suspected to be the mole within the organisation after he turns out to be the sole survivor of a mission gone wrong. Fleeing from the scene to avoid arrest, Hunt enlists the help of two former agents to find out the real culprit and prove his innocence.Helmed by Brian De Palma (the director of Carrie & Scarface), the storyline is quite difficult to follow for there are many twists n turns in the movie that don't make much sense. Even the script is poorly written for the plot & characters lack considerable depth & substance, and the only thing that saves it from being an absolute disaster is the inventive action it has in store.Set design is very much in sync with De Palma's style, Camera-work is fluid & is at its best during the action sequences, Editing provides a steady pace for the events to unfold but makes the narrative too complex, background score is fitting, special effects is impressive and amongst its cast, only Tom Cruise is the one who puts in some effort to stay out of the complaint zone.On an overall scale, Mission: Impossible may give the illusion of a clever & intelligent spy- thriller but beneath that false sugarcoating is something that's hollow, mediocre & absurd. The action segments do a terrific job in hiding its faulty layers, and most viewers won't even mind its lacking elements as long as they are entertained but its shortcomings are exposed on multiple viewings.",Null,0,0,21 July 2015

Saw," 'I Wanna Play A Game'
","Incorrectly labeled by many as the film that commenced the 'torture porn' phenomenon, Saw is director James Wan's debut feature which beautifully exhibits his instant grip & comfort with the elements of the genre this picture belongs to. And even though its strong cult following spawned a series that bathed in gruesome torture, this 1st chapter of the Saw franchise is undoubtedly the most compact, story-driven movie that works as an exciting, effective & shocking horror mystery full of twists & turns.Filmed on a modest budget & shot mostly in a single location, the story of Saw revolves around 2 men who wake up chained in a dilapidated bathroom with a dead body in between them & are given instructions via a micro-cassette recorder explaining how to escape. With limited time in their hands, both men try to figure out why they were chosen for this scenario while in the meantime, police detectives try to uncover the identity of the mastermind behind these 'games' by looking for clues in several other similar incidents.The direction by James Wan is excellent considering the eerie vibe he was able to generate along with its unpredictability & cleverly executed twists. The script may lack a chunk of flesh when it comes to characterization but it still keeps the story far more believable than its successors. The rest of its technical aspects are finely carried out, the performances by its cast is quite amateur but Charlie Clouser's score is a definite plus here as it keeps elevating the tension throughout its runtime & is at its best during the final moments.And despite the fact that it leaves many events unresolved in the end, which are dealt in its sequels, Saw somehow still manages to work as a standalone feature to a great extent & is skilfully crafted by director James Wan & screenwriter Leigh Wannell. On an overall scale, this independent horror certainly isn't the torture porn you might be expecting for it's a solidly structured, nicely assembled & violently narrated cinema that'll have you guessing from its opening moments & deserves to be seen by every horror fan out there.P.S. If the violence in this film turns out to be too much for you, then in all seriousness... stay away from its sequels. Those installments are strictly reserved for hardcore fans of extreme cinema or for any deranged soul looking for new methods to torture his/her boss, spouse, ex or foes.",Null,0,1,23 June 2014
Mama," 'Mama' May Be Clichéd, Contrived & Conventional But It Still Boasts Some Genuinely Unnerving Moments
","Marred by our own familiarity with the genre yet managing to be quite effective when the occasion calls for it, Andrés Muschietti's feature-length adaptation of his short film of the same name is consistent in its delivery of old-school scares, and brilliantly keeps its eerie vibe alive for the major portion of its runtime but what brings it down is its overly sentimental & underwhelming ending.The story of Mama concerns two young girls who were abandoned in a forest cabin and are found 5 years after their disappearance by a rescue party, that was sponsored by their uncle. Kept under psychiatric care for a while, the two girls prepare their return to domestic life under the custody of their uncle & his girlfriend but the young couple soon finds out that their nieces brought someone else with them.Co-written & directed by Andrés Muschietti, Mama is crafted with care & affection and sets up its premise with an interesting, if far-fetched, prologue. Muschietti's direction is impressive for a first feature but his inexperience also surfaces, for he has no idea of how to handle the origin story of the ghostly figure we encounter in the story and ends up revealing too much, which in turn takes away the mystery and lessens the overall impact.But Muschietti does exhibit talent when it comes to creating & sustaining a foreboding atmosphere and expertly carves out some truly chilling segments from time to time. The slow, steady & smooth manoeuvring of camera brings a discomforting element into the story while those sudden bursts of startling immediacy delivers the jump scares. Sound is brilliantly carried out & effectively utilised. Editing could've been better while its background score gives it a fairy tale vibe.Coming to the acting department, the cast comprises of Jessica Chastain, Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau, Megan Charpentier, Isabelle Nélisse, Daniel Kash & others, with Charpentier & Nélisse stealing the show. Chastain also chips in with a sincere performance, and her chemistry with the two girls is a treat to watch. Both youngsters exhibit a great comfort in each other's company, because of which their relationship feels authentic & highly convincing. Coaster-Waldau doesn't have much to do but does fine with what he's given.On an overall scale, Mama is clichéd, contrived & conventional but it also boasts some genuinely unnerving moments. It isn't difficult to see why Guillermo del Toro endorsed this chiller, for it has a fairy tale quality to it like his own features, is reliant on its ominous ambiance to deliver the scares, brims with rich themes, and chooses practical effects over CGI. Both its title & tagline hinted that emotions will come into play in this feature at some point but that very sentimentality also turns its final act into a bland affair and concludes the film on an unsatisfying note.In short, Mama is another addition in the long list of horror films that started on a promising note, took a few turns that were simply uncalled for, and wrapped itself up with a climax that failed to deliver the impact its viewers were hoping for.",Null,0,0,24 August 2016
Super 8," Promising Start Ruined By Dismal Ending
","Scoring high on nostalgia and serving as a heartfelt homage to the magical works of Steven Spielberg, Super 8 draws its inspirations from the summer blockbusters of the 1980s and makes impressive use of available resources to deliver the thrills but despite its incredibly promising start, the film fails to conclude the journey on a wholly satisfying note.Directed by J.J. Abrams (Mission: Impossible III & Star Trek), the story is intriguing from the get-go and the nostalgic touches plus nods to earlier classics are carried out in a tasteful fashion. The first act is an absolute delight that sets things up on a spectacular note and paves a solid groundwork for the rest of the story but it all goes awry as the film nears its conclusion.The suspenseful moments are executed with finesse and effortlessly sustain their nail-biting intensity. Even the dramatic moments between the kids exhibit certain tenderness & understanding. The underlying mystery of it all drives the narrative. And performances from the cast is sincere. The ending isn't entirely a disaster but after such an explosive start, more was expected.Overall, Super 8 had the potential to finish as one of the most enjoyable, thrilling & entertaining examples of its kind, and it does walk that path for a good portion of its runtime before stepping off the tracks and derailing in the final moments. It is nonetheless an awe-inspiring effort that's crafted with heart & passion, and will delight many if not all. A missed opportunity of sorts, Super 8 is still worth a shot.",Null,0,0,14 May 2020
The Last Samurai," Honor, Integrity, Beauty & Self-Discovery
","Quite sound in its portrayal of old Japanese customs, traditions and way of life, nicely written by Zwick, convincingly performed by the cast, impressive work by the crew and stunning music by Hans Zimmer, The Last Samurai is a tale of romanticism vs modernism, purity vs corruption, and also a conflict of two different cultures.The Last Samurai tells the tale of Captain Nathan Algren who, traumatized by his inner demons, is given an assignment to defeat the samurai warriors to clear the road for the westernization of Japan by colonial powers during the late 19th century Japan. Defeated and taken hostage by the samurai, Algren undergoes a complete transformation, discovering the power of the enemy, respecting their way of life, embracing their customs and finally taking up arms with them in fighting the army he originally joined for the preservation of their culture.Although director Edward Zwick's research of Japanese history, culture, customs, traditions and accent is impressive, the plot could've made a greater impact than it did as the movie was not as emotionally investing as expected. The camera work is really good, both in the battle scenes and in picturing the westernization of 19th century Japan. The landscapes are beautifully photographed and traditions effectively captured. Tom Cruise plays the traumatic Captain Algren and his performance was convincing. Ken Watanabe plays Katsumoto, the samurai leader, and was the most impressive of the cast and did a terrific job. The movie overall keeps a good pace and narrative and scores high on the entertainment level.Coming to the music, Hans Zimmer has written a brilliant score for the movie that stays true to the Japanese way of music. It weaves itself effortlessly with every event in the movie, striking the right cord at the right time and is one aspect of the film that carries no complaints and without a doubt is another stunning feature in Zimmer's bag.Overall, The Last Samurai is worth your time. The overly melodramatic ending does betray the movie in some way and the film as a whole may lack the authority and emotional impact of the legendary films of its genre, but this epic tale of honor and integrity is still a ride that in the end felt pretty damn good.",Null,1,3,22 March 2012
Sinister," Marred By Its Final Act But A Chilling Experience Nonetheless
","From the director of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Sinister marks director Scott Derrickson's second stint with the genre of horror & is an impressive improvement over his debut chiller. It might not have reached the dizzying heights of the genre masterpieces when it comes to storytelling aspects but it nonetheless accomplishes its goal of scaring the audience in a pretty impressive manner.Opening with an 8mm footage of a family being killed by an unseen figure, Sinister concerns a true-crime writer who along with his family moves into the very house where a disturbing crime once took place in order to help his research. The plot is set in motion when he discovers a cache of snuff films in the attic depicting families being murdered in various ways & ultimately ends up finding much more than he bargained for.Brilliantly directed by Derrickson, the first half of the film is ingeniously structured thanks to the excellent build-up of its premise but its second half plays spoilsport here, especially the final act, although it's not that bad enough to destroy the entire picture. The atmosphere is chilling for the most part, jump cuts are smartly used, sound & music is effectively carried out, and performances by its cast isn't much of a letdown.On an overall scale, Sinister does carry many genre-clichés throughout its runtime while also including few elements which bring the story down by a slight extent but there's less denying that it's a cinematic experience not many horror films of today are able to deliver. Arguably the scariest flick of 2012 and in my opinion the second best Hollywood horror of its year after The Cabin in the Woods, Sinister is definitely worth a shot.",Null,1,3,5 October 2013
Life Is Beautiful," A Powerful Amalgamation Of Love, Family, Tragedy & Sacrifice!
","Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Life Is Beautiful (also known as La vita è bella) is a sweet, delicate & intimately crafted drama that begins as a mesmerising love story full of heart, laughs & affection, only to later change its course to paint a touching portrait of a father-son relationship with mankind's darkest period set against its backdrop.Set in Italy, the story of Life Is Beautiful concerns Guido; a young, carefree Jewish man who courts n marries the woman he loves & lives happily with his family until Italy is occupied by German forces. With his entire family forcibly deported to a Nazi concentration camp, Guido attempts to make the best use of his wit & imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the Holocaust.Co-written & directed by Roberto Benigni, Life Is Beautiful brims with an irresistible charm from its opening moments, introduces all its characters in a captivating manner, and turns darker as the plot progresses. The two halves of the narrative are entirely different in mood, with first-half serving as a pleasant n hilarious love story while the other half is closer to a survival tale in tone.The screenplay adds ample depth to its characters in the first act & succeeds in making the audience invest their emotions into these characters which makes the next part all the more heartbreaking & difficult to watch. Set pieces are in tone with the depicted timeline, Humour is cleverly infused into the story, Cinematography makes expert use of warm colour tones & handles the camera very efficiently throughout its runtime.Editing lets the story unfold at its own pace & its 116 minutes of runtime is without any dull moments while the soundtrack simply consists of beautiful, elegant & heartwarming tracks that further elevate the whole experience. Coming to the performances, every cast member chips in with vital inputs but it's Roberto Benigni once again who steals the show in the role of Guido, and his confident, charismatic & cheerful work goes a long way in making the film work.The scenes involving Guido & his wife Dora, brilliantly played by Nicoletta Braschi, and then between Guido & his son Giosué are a delight to watch and the chemistry Benigni shares with his co-stars is pure bliss. However, the film tends to get a lot of useless flak for using comedy in a Holocaust-related drama but frankly, it isn't even about Holocaust in the first place, and that part is quite evident if one tries to view it from Guido's perspective & what he really was trying to do.On an overall scale, Life Is Beautiful is a powerful amalgamation of love, family & sacrifice that wonderfully balances its elements of comedy, drama, romance & tragedy to illustrate the great extent a caring father goes to protect his son's innocence, and presents Roberto Benigni in complete control of his craft, both in front n behind the camera. An extremely melancholic & deeply heartfelt cinema that's equally amusing & emotional, Life Is Beautiful is one of the finest gems to come out of Italian cinema, and is highly recommended to every film lover out there.",Null,0,1,9 June 2015

A Clockwork Orange," A Vicious Socio-Political Satire That's Witty & Disturbing In Equal Doses!
","One of the most controversial, violent & disturbing films ever made, A Clockwork Orange is a meticulously crafted, ingeniously narrated & brilliantly performed cinema from Stanley Kubrick that presents the demanding perfectionist in sublime form as he blends violence, erotica, humour & classical compositions into one tightly structured & highly gripping sci-fi comedy to offer his biting take on morality, psychology & the importance of free will.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of A Clockwork Orange is set in the future Britain and follows Alex DeLarge; a delinquent youngster who leads a small gang of thugs, and covers his crime spree with his droogs, his subsequent capture by the police & his time in prison where he learns of an experimental aversion therapy which, if he manages to pass, will get him back on the streets but not everything during his rehabilitation goes the way he expected.Written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, A Clockwork Orange makes its intentions very clear within its opening moments that it isn't going to be an easy sit for its audience as just one evening of 'ultra-violence' perpetrated by Alex & his droogs is enough to scar many but this sadistic nature of the depicted violence exists for a reason and plays a vital role in the story's outcome for Kubrick here aims to critique the bigger problem than the evilness of an individual.Just like any other Kubrick film, A Clockwork Orange is a work of painstaking craftsmanship that presents the filmmaker in complete control of his craft. Although his vision of the future Britain may not be entirely convincing but some of its elements are much in tune with where the current society seems to be heading. Production design team come up with set pieces that brim with sexual undertones while the excessive use of white colour is one of Kubrick's own trademarks.Cinematography is inventive, influential & effectively carried out for the camera makes very efficient use of its bright colour palette, lighting, shadows, fluid movements & close-ups to capture the unfolding drama and encapsulates the whole picture with an otherworldly feel. Despite clocking in at 136 minutes, its pacing is never an issue. Plus, the seamless manner in which the already existing classical compositions are fused with its disturbing images is certainly amongst the film's most spectacular aspects.Coming to the acting department, A Clockwork Orange is pretty much a one-man show as Malcolm McDowell steals every moment with a charismatic but equally maniacal rendition of his character and his screen presence is so magnetic that it makes Alex DeLarge one of the most fascinating antiheroes to surface in cinema history. Although the performances by everyone, including McDowell may seem overly theatrical, it eventually works out in favour of the picture for it adds a sardonic element in an already bizarre narrative.On an overall scale, A Clockwork Orange has aged tremendously well over the years and only gets more rewarding on every subsequent viewing. Frightening & witty in equal doses, controversial on the grounds of its violent imagery yet an eye-opener when it comes to the subject of morality, this socio-political satire remains as relevant today as it was during its time of release and its critical take on mental conditioning that aims to control an individual by removing his or her ability to choose transcends the realms of psychology itself. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.",Null,2,3,28 September 2015

The Fly," Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid.
","A clever example of science-fiction & unsettling work of horror, The Fly tells the story of Seth Brundle; a brilliant but eccentric scientist who is near a revolutionary breakthrough as his teleportation machine is near completion. Earlier only able to teleport inanimate objects, he finally is able to send through living objects from one pod to another. But while he is testing the machine on himself, a housefly manage to enter the pod & what comes out from the other pod after teleportation isn't completely Brundle.This is the first film by David Cronenberg that I've seen so I had no idea what to expect. And as the film ended, I was left astounded by what I've seen. Cronenberg's direction is absolutely fabulous & the manner in which he has structured & progressed the plot from start to finish is amazing to observe. The screenplay is very much focused on Brundle & thanks to Jeff Goldblum's superb performance, he's able to connect with us much before his accident because of which his character arc feels less appalling & far more tragic.The performances by Geena Davis & John Getz are no slouch either but this is Jeff Goldblum's film all the way. Cinematography & editing plays its part well but it's the make-up department that deserves the most applause for its equally shocking & impressive design of the creature & Brundle's gradual transformation. And the music by Howard Shore leaves no stone unturned in turning this cinema into a potential nightmare. On an overall scale, The Fly is one of the best films of its genre that even today remains as disturbing an experience as it was during its time of release.A must for fans of horror, a must for fans of science-fiction, a must for fans of David Cronenberg & a must for anyone who is looking for a cinema that would make them skip their meals for a day or two, The Fly is highly recommended. Turns out that the makers of this film truly meant it when they put out the tagline: 'Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid.'",Null,0,1,6 April 2014

Reservoir Dogs," Quentin Tarantino's Feature Film Debut Is A Milestone Of Indie Filmmaking
","Quentin Tarantino's feature film debut is an ingeniously directed, deftly scripted & strongly performed cinema that didn't just commence his filmmaking career on a spectacular note but also had a profound impact on the independent cinema landscape for the sharpness in its dialogues, the rich set of characters it packs in & the remarkable use of humour in most gruesome moments are some of the many elements that have gone on to inspire countless flicks over the years and has turned this instant classic into an influential one.The story of Reservoir Dogs finds six criminals, who are complete strangers to each other, brought together under one roof by a crime boss to pull off a diamond heist. But when the robbery goes awry, resulting in some casualties, the remaining survivors begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop. With tension running high in the group and one of their own bleeding to death, they try to figure out who sold them out while also coming up with a plan for what to do with the stolen stash, unbeknownst to them that the mole is still around.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs is one of the strongest debuts any filmmaker has ever had in the annals of cinema and finds Tarantino playing with storytelling aspects to carve out his own distinctive narrative style. A marvellous feat of originality, the film borrows different elements from different movies yet blends them together in a manner that bears Tarantino's signature all over it. His writing is possibly even better for everything about it, be it the plot progression, character developments, non-linear narration, numerous pop culture references or clever use of wit, it all gels with each other quite seamlessly.Despite being shot on a modest budget, the technical aspects are no slouch in this feature. Production team does a good enough job to accommodate all the set pieces into minimum locations. Cinematography exhibits some new, innovative tricks to capture every sequence and makes some exquisite use of camera angles, long takes & panning shots while Editing is another highlight that provides its non-linear narrative a really smooth flow & consistent pace. The film features no background music but it makes wonderful use of existing tracks that are seamlessly incorporated into scenes that are most unlikely to work with them yet it all just fits.Coming to the performances, Reservoir Dogs features a terrific ensemble in Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn & Laurence Tierney with a few more people appearing in brief roles, including Tarantino himself as Mr. Brown. Keitel & Roth are the centrepieces of this story and both deliver flawless performances in their given roles of Mr. White & Mr. Orange, respectively. Madsen plays Mr. Blonde with a calm demeanour that nicely masks his inner psychopath. Buscemi is an absolute delight as Mr. Pink and handles his character like a professional. While Tierney & Penn have their own moments to shine as the crime lord & his son, respectively.On an overall scale, Reservoir Dogs is one of the greatest achievements of indie filmmaking which, even after two decades, remains one of Tarantino's finest efforts. From the opening moment that finds this gang providing their analysis of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin', Reservoir Dogs casts a spell on its audience whose effect is felt long after the story has concluded on the screen. An original, inventive & ageless masterpiece that's bursting with a reinvigorating passion and is also notable for launching the careers of many, best of them being Tarantino himself who, in the following years, would go on to script an unmatched legacy of his own, Reservoir Dogs is a milestone of gripping, clever & quality storytelling.

Rocky," The Quintessential Underdog Tale Whose Success Emulated Its Own Story
","The quintessential underdog tale whose success emulated its very own story, Rocky didn't just became the highest grossing film of its year despite being made on a mere budget of a million dollars but also went on to win three Academy Awards including Best Picture, and is also responsible for launching the career of many, most notably Sylvester Stallone.Set in Philadelphia, Rocky tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer working as a debt collector for a loan shark who later gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship when the reigning champion, Apollo Creed, decides to give a local contender a chance of a lifetime. The plot then follows Rocky's training for the big night for he prepares to go all the distance against Creed.Written by Sylvester Stallone & directed by John G. Avildsen, Rocky is crafted with a clear vision of what it's supposed to be and is totally devoted to its script & the characters who inhabit it. The screenplay is brilliantly penned down for each character plays a relevant role in the story's outcome but the focus is always on its titular character, who is fleshed out by Stallone amazingly well, both on paper & on the film canvas.Shot on a shoestring budget which seems pretty evident from the set pieces its production design team puts up on the screen, the technical aspects here may lack the more polished, refined look when compared to other examples of its genre but its raw photography doesn't bother much for the film's heart is very much at the right place and it somehow manages to make each one of its shortcomings work in the story's favour.The camera-work & lighting is crude but is expected, given its low budget. Editing is a mixed bag for few moments end up overstaying its welcome while it's absolutely perfect on other instances. But the biggest contributor of them all, in my opinion, is Bill Conti's magnificent score that elevates the experience to a whole different level with its pulsating, passionate & inspiration-inducing tracks and is single-handedly responsible for turning many sequences into instant classic moments.Coming to the performances, Rocky features an interesting cast in Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers & Burgess Meredith, with all of them doing a terrific job in their given roles but it's Stallone who impresses the most and while he may seem off on few occasions, it's his performance only that made his character a cultural icon. Shire & Young have their moments, Weather does well as Apollo Creed while everything about Meredith is spot-on for the veteran actor steals every moment he's in.On an overall scale, Rocky is the greatest sports film ever made that remains unsurpassed in the reach of its influence on its genre, pop culture & cinema as a whole. Catapulting the careers of many, turning Stallone into an overnight sensation and spawning a franchise that went on for 30 more years, Rocky isn't without its complaints but the plethora of positives, passion & motivation that oozes from every frame of this classic easily brushes aside those little nitpicks. Packing a heavy dose of adrenaline & providing a huge shot of inspiration, Rocky comes strongly recommended.",Null,1,1,24 September 2015
Eyes Wide Shut," The Final Masterpiece From The Greatest Filmmaker Of All Time
","From the director behind influential masterpieces like The Killing, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining & Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut marks the final entry in the decades-spanning, unprecedented & extraordinary filmmaking career of Stanley Kubrick. And just like all of his reappraised works, is a classic that unveils more of its intricate layers on multiple viewings.Set in New York City, Eyes Wide Shut tells the story of Dr. William 'Bill' Harford whose life spirals out of control when his wife tells him about an erotic fantasy she had about another man which shatters his faith in her. Unable to get the image of his wife & the other man out of his head, he embarks on a night-long adventure during which he comes extremely close to cheating on his wife & also infiltrates a quasi-religious sexual ritual at a country mansion after learning about it from a friend.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Eyes Wide Shut is a film about sexual desires that's jam-packed with symbolism & metaphorical elements. The entire film exhibits a sexually charged atmosphere and every single character inhabiting it has nothing but sex on his or her mind. Kubrick's direction makes efficient use of all his trademarks and just like before, he manages to push forward the existing boundaries of the medium while adding a few innovative tricks into the filmmaking manual in the process.The screenplay smears the plot with multitudes of themes & insinuations, the story unfolds in a slow, methodical manner, the leading characters have an in-depth complexity which is wonderfully illustrated by the master storyteller, each sequence is meticulously detailed & technically refined, and it has a lot to say about sex, infidelity, physical relations, desires & fantasies. However, dialogue isn't one of its strengths for every time anyone says anything, the other character repeats the same as a question which becomes annoying after a while.The technical aspects always score very high marks in Kubrick films and Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. The set pieces are gorgeously rendered, extensively detailed & beautifully lit. Cinematography encapsulates the entire picture with a bizarre, dream-like ambiance which goes on to further amplify the overall experience while also intensifying its erotic attributes. The use of colours is noteworthy while lighting here is a work of perfection. Its 159 minutes of runtime & deliberately slow pace may feel like a challenging ordeal but it never becomes an issue once the drama sets in.The incorporation of classical songs to compliment the unfolding drama continues in Eyes Wide Shut and all the musical arrangements are wisely chosen & carefully infused into the storyline. Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Marie Richardson & Todd Field. Even though both Cruise & Kidman put in commendable effort into their respective roles of Mr. & Mrs. Harford, it's actually their on- spot chemistry that makes them click so well, and while there are no definite stand-outs, the contribution by its entire cast only works in the film's favour.On an overall scale, Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut may not be as pathbreaking as most of his masterpieces but it's nonetheless a deeply fascinating meditation on sexual relations and despite its cynical tone, manages to be an erotic, enthralling & engaging thriller. While the plot is heavy & explicit in sexual content, approaching it as a sex-romp cinema won't do enough justice for Kubrick digs much deeper into the primordial aspects of human nature to put up an exquisite looking tale that's aesthetic, artistic & unlike anything before or since. It may not be Kubrick's greatest, but it's still a genre masterpiece. Thoroughly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.",Null,16,27,22 November 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Inferior To The Original In Every Way Or Shape Or Form
","Though there is no denying that the live-action remake of Disney's 1991 animation classic of the same name is gorgeous to look at, thanks to its extravagant production design, radiant camerawork & exquisite costumes, the film still fails to emulate the dazzling quality & magical flair of the original, and is also unable to transport us to its enchanting world.Directed by Bill Condon, this latest adaptation follows the original faithfully yet never for once manages to capture the beauty & simplicity of its story. Bloated, overlong & ruined by superficiality in nearly every aspect, this visually arresting yet narratively hollow remake brings nothing new to the table. And apart from the nostalgic connection, it's got nothing going for it.The musical numbers don't have the same effect in the live-action scenario, the extra minutes add nothing to the experience, its eye-candy moments of spectacle are missing the charm required to deliver the desired result, and the supporting characters are poorly sketched. Emma Watson is surprisingly amongst the few positives about this film and her chemistry with Dan Stevens has a certain warmth to it as well.On an overall scale, Beauty and the Beast is inferior to the 1991 musical romance fantasy in every way or shape or form but Condon's reiteration has an authentic touch & sweet vibe to it that prevents it from being a total disaster. However, the film still fails to offer a valid reason for its existence, just like every other Disney's live-action remake of their beloved classics. It might appease the newcomers but won't garner a similar reception from most die-hard fans of the original masterpiece.",Null,1,4,22 October 2019
Sicario," A Bone-Chilling Portrait Of Border Warfare!
","A downright intense, gritty & unadulterated journey into the world of Mexican drug cartels that also contemplates the darkness of human behaviour, Sicario continues director Denis Villeneuve's steady rise in the film industry as this immensely talented filmmaker delivers yet again with a highly captivating thriller that's impressive enough to rank as one of the finest offerings of the year, so far.The story of Sicario follows an idealistic FBI agent who volunteers to join a covert operation to battle the escalating drug violence in the border areas between USA & Mexico. Assisting her in the mission are a supposed DoD adviser & a mysterious agent who has an agenda of his own. After witnessing the illegitimate manner in which the assignment was being carried out, the new agent is pushed to her moral & ethical limits.Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique, Incendies, Prisoners & Enemy), Sicario opens on a high note for its first act is a masterwork of tense, gripping & razor-sharp storytelling and presents the promising filmmaker in sublime form. The film is able to grab the viewers' attention from the beginning and its foreboding atmosphere is maintained till the very end. And while it slows down a bit after its tightly-packed first act but even in those moments, it never drops its gear.Taylor Sheridan's screenplay is no slouch for the story puts greater emphasis on characters inhabiting this crime thriller although it shifts its focus from one to another over the course of its runtime, which was quite unexpected, but since the primary characters are so expertly written, the change in focus doesn't become much of an issue. One drawback, however, is a sub-segment involving a Mexican cop that shows up at various intervals but has nothing relevant to contribute to the story.Coming to the technical aspects, Roger Deakins' camera-work is pure wizardry for he stages some truly breathtaking shots through ingenious use of camera angles, smooth movements, slow pans & precision lighting while also making efficient use of desaturated colour palette to encapsulate the whole film with a spiritless ambiance, which fits its narrative. The pacing is methodical throughout its 121 minutes of runtime, and further elevating its tension is the pulsating score from Jóhann Jóhannsson that turns nearly every segment into a nail-biting moment.As far as performances go, Sicario features a dependable cast in Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Daniel Kaluuya, Victor Garber, Jon Bernthal & a few others and everyone is excellent in their given roles. Blunt is impressing a lot of lately with the kind of roles she's picking to play & her utter devotion to her character here makes it one of the finest works of her career, so far. Brolin also chips in strongly with what was expected from him. Finally, the ever-reliable del Toro only gets better as the plot progresses & in the end, effortlessly steals the show with his quiet but brooding performance.On an overall scale, Sicario is a tightly-structured, tautly narrated & sharp-edged thriller that packs in an engrossing story filled with compelling characters and also brims with palpable tension from start to finish, is narrated with a tight grip on all aspects & is further elevated by outstanding performances from its cast, especially Blunt & del Toro. While there was still some room left for improvement and the rigidness of its tightly-knit first act is lost once the middle act takes over, Sicario is still worth your time & money and deserves a watch for its fascinating portrait of border warfare alone.

The Descent," The Very Definition of Horror in Its Purest Form.
","One of the most genuinely frightening & paranoia inducing films to come out in a long time, The Descent is an ingeniously crafted horror masterpiece that seamlessly intertwines its incredibly tense & cleverly paced story with inventive cinematography, tight editing, mesmerizing score & strong performances from its all-female cast to create an undeniably creepy atmosphere of unrelenting claustrophobia which eventually launches such an all-out assault on our senses that the ensuing events turn into nothing short of an escalating experience of nightmarish horror.Inducing fear from its isolated look, grim tone & eerie mood rather than relying on typical jump scares, The Descent is the very definition of horror in its purest form and with its sinister plot & nerve-jangling adventure, easily qualifies as one of the scariest films of this or any other decade. Its story concerns Sarah; an adventure junkie, who accompanies her friends on a spelunking trip after suffering a horrible tragedy an year ago. But their adventure soon turns into nightmare as their cave expedition goes horribly wrong & they find themselves being pursued by strange blood thirsty creatures.The direction by Neil Marshall is very impressive as he lets the claustrophobic nature of his film play mind games with the viewers & by employing the 'less is more' trick, he truly succeeds in letting our imagination run wild. The screenplay makes sure that plenty of time is devoted to creating the build up, tension & mood of isolation while moving the story forward. The mountains & underground caves are exquisitely photographed but it's the effective use of shadows & lighting where cinematography plays its best part. And David Julyan's score contributed immensely in evoking the perfect tension & mood this film was aiming for.Coming to the acting department, this film features an all female cast of six beautiful actresses who all chipped in with strong & sincere performances which apart from providing this film a realistic mood also made the drama all the more plausible. The character of Sarah is the centered piece around whom the whole story revolves, and Shauna MacDonald has done a terrific job in elegantly capturing the trauma, uncertainty & survival instincts of her character. The rest of the performances are no slouch either & everyone did an amazing job in their given roles.On an overall scale, The Descent is a claustrophobic horror that works as a masterfully executed piece of original work from Neil Marshall and is an illustrious example of a horror film done right. It plays with your mind, forcing you to make assumptions & imagine the outcomes, and yet manages to surprise & shock you psychologically & viscerally. Destined to bring a smile on the face of every horror fanatics along with many screams of horror, this bloodstained nightmare of a spelunking adventure gone horribly wrong is absolutely recommended.P.S. Make sure you grab the Unrated Cut of The Descent for it contains the original ending which sensibly wraps this film in a way that was always meant to be. The alternate ending (which was included in its US release) cuts to credits before its real ending & only ends up destroying so many of the possible outcomes it could've had, just for the sake of cashing in on its success with an uninspired sequel which eventually happened.",Null,2,6,8 October 2013
Some Like It Hot," Nobody's Perfect. But Billy Wilder Did Come Close.
","Listed by American Film Institute as the greatest American comedy film of all time, Some Like It Hot may not live up to its exceptional reputation if one approaches it with such towering expectations but it certainly affirms its status as one of the best comedy films out there that promises loads of laughter & effortlessly delivers it.Set in 1929 in Chicago, Some Like It Hot tells the story of two struggling musicians who, after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, flee the state in an all-female band disguised as women. Catching their eye is the band's vocalist & ukulele player as the two are instantly enticed by her beauty and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises.Directed by Billy Wilder, the film carries a zestful atmosphere from the beginning & is full of hilarious moments that hold up pretty well even today. The screenplay is another work of quality that benefits greatly from Wilder's innate ability to infuse humour even in the most unexpected moments. Camera-work is fluid, editing is neat & music compliments its narrative excellently.Coming to the performances, the main cast comprises of Marilyn Monroe & her two bosom companions in Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon. And although Monroe's performance may not be that enticing, her screen presence certainly is. Curtis & Lemmon also share an amazing chemistry together but the latter turns out to be an absolute live-wire in his given role & impressed the most.On an overall scale, Some Like It Hot has wonderfully endured the test of time and remains one of its genre's most enjoyable, entertaining & influential works. Over the years, its quality hasn't diminished by one bit, the funny moments are all the more refreshing & it continues to inspire endless comedies even to this date. A timeless classic, a cinematic treasure & still a red hot experience, Some Like It Hot is delightfully recommended.",Null,1,2,17 September 2014
Pulp Fiction," Quentin Tarantino's Magnum Opus Is Cinematic History In The Making
","Every once in a while, a film comes along that changes everything. Whenever the industry went out of ideas & employed the same formula for too long, there always emerged a new wave of films that injected new life into this medium and in the process ended up changing the way we are accustomed to watching & perceiving motion pictures. And Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, one of those movies.Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes & Best Screenplay at Oscars, Pulp Fiction was a force to be reckoned with at its time of release for it opened many realms that were previously thought to be non-existent and in the long run, didn't just influence cinema but other media as well. Everything about it was different from the norm and it remains one of the most original & groundbreaking stories to ever unfold on the silver screen.Pulp Fiction intertwines three different story lines into one and is told in a nonlinear fashion. The first follows two hit men who are out to retrieve a mysterious suitcase which belongs to their boss. The second is about one of those two hit men who's put in charge of taking care of the boss' wife while he's out of town. And third concerns an aging but proud boxer who is asked to drop a fight in exchange for a handsome reward. The lives of these odd people collide in unexpected ways, resulting in some hilarious situations.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, his sophomore effort is even better than his debut feature which was a milestone in itself. Tarantino has injected the script with extensive pop culture references, a vast line-up of idiosyncratic characters & explosive dialogues plus the way this whole story is narrated and its wicked fusion of violence & humour turns it into an endlessly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly refreshing ride that's in a league of its own.What's also amazing is the fact that most of the conversations taking place in the movie is not even related to the plot and is simply a casual discussion on a randomly chosen topic. And yet, without these wisecracking moments, Pulp Fiction wouldn't really be Pulp Fiction. The amount of focus that went into the smallest of details during the writing process is this film's biggest strength and when it comes to pure screenplay wizardry, Pulp Fiction has no equals & probably never will.The technical aspects are no slouch for the picture exhibits a number of new tricks when it comes to bringing the script to life on the film canvas. Cinematography presents Tarantino adding a few more photography techniques to his sleeve that would later become his own trademarks. Editing intentionally rearranges the order in which the events unfold and keeps the viewers on their toes at all times. And the soundtrack is a compilation of rock n roll, pop & surf music that are cleverly chosen and surprisingly fit the accompanying sequences.Two key elements that are highly contrasting in general but, in Tarantino's films, fit together as if co-dependent on each other is violence & humour. He's a rare artist who is capable of making us laugh uncontrollably at a scene that involves a person's head getting blown-off. Now there is substantial amount of violence in this picture but those violent sequences are also its funniest moments and the reason why it works so well is coz the addition of hilarity to such brutality significantly neutralizes the effect gore & violence alone may have had on the audience.Coming to the acting department, Pulp Fiction features a star-studded cast in John Travolta ,Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, & many more, and is notable for launching & revitalising the careers of many. Travolta resurrects himself with a smashing performance in the role of Vincent Vega. Jackson not delivers his career-best work but ends up reincarnating himself for this is the movie that made Samuel L. Jackson what Samuel L. Jackson is today and he will forever be indebted to Tarantino for this.Both Travolta & Jackson play the two hit men and their chemistry just clicks. Thurman plays Mia Wallace and is absolutely electrifying in her given role. Marsellus Wallace is a character whose presence looms over the entire story even during his absence & Ving Rhames didn't disappoint in portraying him. Willis adds another feather to his acting range and does nicely in balancing the toughness of his boxer character with a soft spot for his wife. Keitel steals every moment he is in. Roth & Plummer also have their moments to shine, and each one of them succeeds in bringing these scripted characters to life in just the right dose.On an overall scale, with its surprisingly powerful combination of unconventional structure, stylish direction, remarkable screenplay, stellar performances, energetic pace, mesmerising soundtrack and Tarantino's patented mix of violence & humour, Pulp Fiction succeeds as a delicious piece of pop culture that thrills & amuses in a highly unusual manner and is rightly counted amongst the greatest movies ever made. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, an unsurpassed milestone in independent filmmaking, and a landmark moment in cinema history that permanently engraved Tarantino's name in the annals of filmmaking, Pulp Fiction is essential viewing in every sense of the word. Multiple viewings advised.",Null,2,5,16 December 2015
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Simply Hilarious & Hysterical From Start To Finish
","Guy Ritchie's feature film debut is a stylishly directed, cleverly scripted & ably performed crime comedy that borrows heavily from Quentin Tarantino's method of filmmaking in both style & substance yet succeeds in carving an identity of its own with its original, inventive & brainy concept teamed with excellent use of British humour.The story of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels concerns four friends who find themselves heavily indebted to a powerful crime lord after a rigged game of cards. Given a limited time to arrange the money, they decide to rob a small-time gang operating just next door to pay off the debt but an unexpected turn of events soon throws everyone into confusion.Written & directed by Guy Ritchie, the film marks his breakthrough in the movie industry and is crafted with excellent wit, flair & imagination from start to finish. The screenplay employs a non-linear storyline but it all comes together near the end to form a satisfying whole. The dialogues are sharp, comic timing is spot-on and the plot brims with memorable one-liners.Coming to the performances, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels brings many new talents on the screen, including Jason Statham and they all chip in with viable inputs and are fully committed to their given roles. Also working in the film's favour is its dynamic camera-work, tight editing that keeps the plot moving, and smart use of existing songs which wonderfully compliments its narrative.On an overall scale, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels is an unabashedly hilarious, highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & utterly satisfying ride that easily goes down as one of British cinema's finest crime films. A solid start for Guy Ritchie, a smooth blend of crime & comedy and always a fun experience no matter how many times you watch it, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels comes thoroughly recommended.",Null,0,1,14 October 2013

The Da Vinci Code," As Trite As Religion Itself. A Bland, Overlong & Convoluted Conspiracy Theory.
","As tripe as religion itself, Ron Howard's The Da Vinci Code manages to create a sense of interest in its opening moments and is involving to a certain extent but the longer it goes on, the more absurd it becomes. Convoluted, inflated & packed with provocative Christian allegories, it's simply a series of nonsensical twists & turns that goes on for far too long.The story of The Da Vinci Code follows an American symbologist & a French cryptographer as they team up to investigate a grisly murder the former is suspected of. With the help of clues present in Leonardo da Vinci's works, the two attempt to connect the dots and end up discovering a religious mystery that could shake the very foundations of Christianity.Directed by Ron Howard (best known for Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind & Rush), The Da Vinci Code is intriguing at first, opening with the event that sets its story into motion, but it starts getting more n more confusing as the story progresses and its endless barrage of exposition crosses that fine line after which you just don't care where it's headed and wait for it to end.While the storytelling aspect suffers from multitudes of issues, the technical aspects make the ride a little less frustrating. Set pieces are meticulously detailed, camera-work is fluid and captures each moment in a clear, concise fashion, and Hans Zimmer further enriches everything with an excellent score. Editing, however, is messed up and is unable to provide the level of transparency the picture required.Coming to the acting department, the film features an impressive ensemble in Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, Jean Reno & Paul Bettany but their respective characters lack the required depth. Hanks is in as Robert Langdon and is surprisingly wooden in the role, Tautou is often clueless & confused, not to mention that there's virtually no chemistry between the two. And the only good performance comes from McKellen.On an overall scale, The Da Vinci Code garnered as much controversy as its source material at its time of release but it's one overlong, boring & bewildering conspiracy theory that isn't even worth the time or money. Whatever interest was generated within its first act goes out the window in the next, following which the story heads into the pretentious zone and unleashes one laughable twist after another before finally concluding on an unrewarding & forgettable note.",Null,1,3,13 June 2017
Titanic," Fall In Love, Again.
","One of the latest inquiries about this film's re-release was how it is in 3D. Pretty damn dazzling I would say. The details are more enriched, dark scenes are surprisingly crisp & clear and the entire experience is unforgettable. Re-mastered right from the ground up, In 3D, Titanic is a much more intimate experience. The visual effects are still better than most CGI films that comes out these days. Featuring epic depiction of disaster that very few movies can match, exceptional music by James Horner that today is easily one of the most recognizable scores, and last but not the least, James Cameron, who has always pushed the boundaries of technology in film-making to new levels, for crafting it with such care and dedication that it made the whole world fall in love with it, again.

Rocky III," I Pity The Fool Who Green-Lighted It!
","The third instalment in the Rocky series, the story of Rocky III is set 4 years after the events of the previous chapter and follows Rocky Balboa who, after many successful title defences & his ever increasing fame, is strongly considering retirement but falls into depression after losing the title to a rookie boxer and turns to a former enemy to get himself back in the ring.Written & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky III is a mediocre sequel that takes the series into a different direction and features a more campy tone that soon becomes very annoying. The screenplay isn't good at all for the plot wastes time on sequences that don't even play any relevant role in the final outcome, not much is added to reprising characters while the new ones are instantly forgettable.There isn't much to talk about its technical aspects for none of the elements have anything new to offer and while its reduced runtime is a welcome change, the final fight this film was building itself to ends up sooner than expected and on that scale, it's disappointing. As far as performances go, everyone fails to make their mark while Mr. T leaves no stone unturned to make his character one of the lamest ever to step into the ring.On an overall scale, Rocky III might be fun for those who had a good time with Rocky II but it marks a departure from what the first film was all about. There are a couple of interesting moments in the picture but most of it is forgettable. Stallone's input both in front & behind the camera continues its downfall, the dialogues are pretty much garbage, the finale fails to live up to its hype, and although Bill Conti's score feels repetitive, it's the only element that fares as per expectations.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Magical Adventure for All Ages.
","It's quite nostalgic to revisit the magical world of Harry Potter after so many years, yet surprising to discover that it still has a charming quality about itself. The first in the 8-part film series, Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone (also known as Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone) may not have the darkness or complexity of its later instalments but what it manages to retain is the freshness, innocence & excitement one feels when embarking on a new adventure.Based on the novel of the same name by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone begins the journey of The Boy Who Lived and covers his adventures during his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Completely oblivious to the world of magic as well as his famed celebrity status, the young Potter learns to adjust well at his new home & begins to prove his worth but soon realises that this magical world is far more dangerous for him than he imagined.Directed by Chris Columbus, the film is a wonderful treat for kids & families plus as far as the screenplay goes, it remains pretty faithful to its source material. Cinematography beautifully captures the ambiance of Hogwarts, music by John Williams provides a magical feeling of its own & the visual effects clearly doesn't seem to have aged well over the years. Looking back, there are few moments which today seem pretty silly or stupid & unfortunately with every passing year, it's only going to get worse.Coming to the acting department, there are performances ranging from pretty impressive to childish & annoying but I still have nothing to complain about the casting choices made here as not a single actor feels like a miscast in the story. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson do their part fine but it's Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane & Richard Harris who impress most in their respective roles of Severus Snape, Rubeus Hagrid & Albus Dumbledore.On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone may not look as magical today as it was during its time of release but it's still a wonderful adaptation of J.K. Rowling's spellbinding world on the silver screen, which would later go on to become a cultural phenomenon of our time. And even though its story might be more aimed at younger audience, there are moments present in the film that will have even adults gazing at the screen with a childlike sense of wonder. Worth a watch? Definitely.",Null,0,1,16 July 2014
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Dark Lord Shall Rise... Again!
","An incredibly dark premise in comparison to its predecessors, the 4th chapter of Harry Potter film franchise wasn't just burdened with the daunting task of adapting the then-longest novel by J.K. Rowling into a single film but also had to live up to the benchmark set by the previous chapter. And even though it trims down or skips over far too many events of the book, what it eventually puts on the table is still a damn good movie, even if it's no match to Alfonso Cuarón's Prisoner of Azkaban.Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire covers Potter's 4th year at Hogwarts that's unlike any other year as this time the school of magic plays host to a legendary event, The Triwizard Tournament; in which a champion from each of the 3 schools is chosen to compete in a series of dangerous contests for eternal glory. However, when Harry is chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete despite being an underage contestant, he is left with no choice but to go through with it while the devil patiently waits to make his return.As Cuarón decided against returning for this sequel, the director's chair this time passes on to Mike Newell at which he does a wonderful job as this movie retains the dark atmosphere of the book and is smoothly narrated from start to finish. Screenplay is sure to divide fans of the book but considering the runtime restriction of a movie, it is deftly adapted. The camera-work is exquisitely handled, editing keeps the tension alive & the background score by Patrick Doyle is darkly fascinating.Coming to the performances, the supporting cast gets even stronger as Brendan Gleeson comes aboard as Alastor 'MadEye' Moody; Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, while Ralph Fiennes takes the coveted role of The Dark Lord Voldemort. The 3 leads chip in with fine performances once again but it's Radcliffe who shows most improvement. VFX is excellently carried out & the stunning rendition of the Hungarian Horntail is its highpoint as the dragon is a sight to behold.The one major disappointment I have with this film is that I really wanted the depiction of You- Know-Who as per the book but it sucks to find that wish unfulfilled. On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire offers loads of entertainment, excitement & enjoyment from its opening moments and is a worthy addition to the franchise that manages to make most things work in its favour. Expertly crafted, swiftly paced, intensely fun & possessing a magical touch in its presentation, this dark chapter in the life of The Boy Who Lived is worth your time & money.",Null,0,1,21 July 2014
Thor," Not As Mighty As Its Titular Character But Definitely A Step-Up For Marvel
","Fantasy isn't really a genre I usually approach with open arms but I can't deny that some of the most dazzling cinematic experiences I've had came from this category of films, from examples like The Lord of the Rings. Now Marvel's Thor isn't even close to that classic nor it aims for that level of grandeur but it still qualifies as a good, if not great, adventure- fantasy that nicely balances its dark & light elements to deliver a entertainment that's pretty satisfiable.Marking the fourth instalment in Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor tells the story of its titular character; the crown prince of Asgard & the god of thunder who wields a magical hammer. The plot covers his banishment from his realm to Earth where he forms a relationship with Jane Foster; an astrophysicist who found him, and later tries to get back to his homeland in order to stop his adopted brother Loki from ascending the Asgardian throne.Directed by Kenneth Branagh, Thor gets many things right from start to finish whether it's properly introducing the Asgardian culture to its audience, fab use of humour blended with cleverly weighed human drama, separate tints for separate realms present in its story, brilliant production design plus a pleasing score by Patrick Doyle but its plot is also too predictable & generic while its visual effects fluctuate in either directions.Coming to the performances, Thor features an impressive cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård & Anthony Hopkins. Not everyone manages to impress here, some are even embarrassing but both Hemsworth & Hiddleston more than make up for what the rest of its cast lacked, as the former proves that he's capable of carrying a larger-than-life character responsibly while the latter chips in with a chameleon- like performance that's equally mischievous.On an overall scale, Thor has its share of flaws & shortcomings but thanks to Hemsworth's magnetic presence, good enough narrative, plenty of spectacles & the way it juggles its dark themes with light-hearted humour, this film is worth a shot. There's one scene where Thor searches reunites with his hammer for the first time after his banishment to Earth but the manner in which that whole sequence plays out, it's hard to not elevate your expectations a bit after watching that. All in all, Thor may not be as memorable as Iron Man but out of the then-four films released by Marvel, this was a sure shot runner-up.",Null,0,1,26 March 2015
Castle in the Sky," Studio Ghibli's Feature Film Debut
","The first anime produced & released under the banner of Studio Ghibli, Castle in the Sky (also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky) is an elegantly crafted, smart narrated & nicely composed adventure which brings us the tale of a young girl in possession of a mysterious crystal who, after ending up in the care of a young boy, embark on a journey with him to find the mythic floating castle of Laputa while they're being pursued by pirates, army & secret agents working for the government who desire the very same thing.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film is infused with this renowned filmmaker's trademarks & thematic elements plus is effectively paced from start to finish. The animation is wonderful to look at, the characters are worthy of our attention, the voice actors have done a fine job in bringing their given roles to life, the camera-work is pretty fluid & the minimalistic use of score works like an enchantment. Also, the floating castle of Laputa is a sight to behold & its meticulous detailing only evokes more admiration for the effort that went into its creation.On an overall scale, Castle in the Sky is the feature film which commenced the legacy of now- legendary Studio Ghibli on a considerably high note and although it isn't one of Miyazaki's finest films in my opinion but its uplifting story & quality narration is impressive enough to make sure that its viewers are entertained & intrigued throughout its runtime. A powerhouse of creativity & imagination, Castle in the Sky is an awe-inspiring work from a master storyteller that promises an enriching cinematic experience & delivers it effortlessly. Positively recommended.",Null,2,2,18 May 2014
The Shape of Water," An Above Average Creature Feature With Stellar Production Design
","A wonderful amalgamation of sumptuous production design, lush camerawork, composed direction & excellent lead performance, The Shape of Water continues Guillermo del Toro's fascination with monsters and is an unconventional story of love that's pure, perceptive & poetic.Set in 1960s America during the Cold War, The Shape of Water tells the story of a mute woman who works at a top secret facility as a janitor where she encounters a captured humanoid amphibian creature, with whom she forms a unique bond & later helps him escape from his captivity.Co-written & directed by Guillermo del Toro (best known for The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth & Crimson Peak), of all the films that I've seen from the notable filmmaker, The Shape of Water is the weakest. Nothing about it is terrible actually but there is nothing about it that's memorable either. It's a typical love story between atypical characters that's crafted with affection, told with tenderness & decorated with splendid set pieces. There is a warmth to their blossoming romance at first but it becomes monotonous during the second half. That dance scene in particular is absolutely cringeworthy.There isn't much to complain in the technical department though. The set pieces in Guillermo del Toro films are usually so finely detailed & refined that much of it is often mistaken for computer generated imagery. Brilliantly utilising the shades of green, Cinematography give its images a luminous quality & fairy tale vibe.Editing calmly directs its different subplots towards the same outcome but pacing is a bit on the slow side, plus there are moments that could have used a few trims. Alexandre Desplat's score resonates a tenderness of its own with its serene tracks though the songs (both original & incorporated) fail to uplift the whole narrative.Coming to the performances, The Shape of Water packs a reliable cast amongst whom Sally Hawkins impress the most in what's a silent rendition that's packed with sincere emotions. Doug Jones adds yet another non-human character to his collection while Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg & Michael Shannon provide good support in their given roles.On an overall scale, The Shape of Water is beautiful to look at and makes splendid use of the director's trademarks but it definitely isn't one of del Toro's finest films. The subplots are more interesting than the main story at hand here, but Hawkins does well to keep us invested in her character's journey to an extent. In short, The Shape of Water is an above average creature feature wrapped in a pretty package.",Null,51,99,16 March 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Somewhat Underrated Yet Unworthy Of Its Title.
","The violent history of the Corleone crime family did conclude on an ideal note in The Godfather Part II but thanks to the unquenchable greed of studio executives plus the dire circumstances director Francis Ford Coppola found himself in during that time, what was until then a perfectly flawless motion picture saga ultimately got tainted by a highly inferior third instalment, which wasn't even needed in the first place.Continuing the story of Michael Corleone, The Godfather Part III finds the aging & guild-ridden Mafia kingpin seeking ways to legitimise his criminal empire and has slowly distanced himself & his family from the underworld, over the years. But his efforts to come out clean is thwarted when an assassination attempt made on his life begins a new era of bad blood between different families. Meanwhile, the Don takes a young protégé under his wing.Co-written, produced & directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who unfortunately lost every single creative brain cell of his during the making of Apocalypse Now, The Godfather Part III packs in a pretty weak story and while it manages to replicate the look of its predecessors, it lacks the precision care, passion & dedication with which the first two instalments were brought to life for the screenplay that Coppola co-wrote with Mario Puzo simply lacks the same level of intensity, tenaciousness & quality.The technical aspects are finely executed to match the ambiance of the previous two films, as evident in its gorgeously detailed set pieces, shooting style, colour tones as well as numerous references to earlier chapters. At 162 minutes, it has the shortest runtime of the three yet is the most difficult to sit through for much of its plot is nothing but plodding and could've benefited from a bit more trimming in the editing room. And the soundtrack by Carmine Coppola only makes use of the previously used tracks and for the most part, stays within its realms.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Al Pacino, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Andy Garcia, Eli Wallach, Sofia Coppola & others and while the reprising cast is able to impress once again, the new members fail to leave a lasting mark. Pacino does amazingly well for the most part and he's brilliantly supported by the well-balanced inputs from Shire & Keaton. Garcia is the best of the new cast yet he's easily overshadowed by the mere presence of the veterans. Wallach chips in with welcome contribution, And the director's daughter commits career-suicide by delivering an awfully terrible performance.On an overall scale, The Godfather Part III gets a lot of flak for leaving a dent on what could've been an unblemished cinematic legacy but it's not really as bad as it is made out to be. In fact, it's quite an underrated cinema for it has its share of interesting moments but then, none of it was ever required. Coppola has himself stated that The Godfather series is two films with this one serving as an epilogue, and that pretty much sums up his opinion about this chapter. Lacking commitment in direction, severely marred by lack of depth & refinement in its screenplay, and further brought down by underwhelming work from its cast, The Godfather Part III is somewhat under-appreciated but it's also unworthy of its title.",Null,0,1,5 January 2016
The Matrix Reloaded," Lacks Everything That Made Its Predecessor An Instant Classic
","Opening with a sequence that was just an indication of stupider things to come, The Matrix Reloaded discards the carefully structured premise of The Matrix, replaces it with a fairly complex but far too messy plot filled with nonsensical philosophies, and is far too concentrated on its action spectacle & visual effects than the storytelling elements, yet failing to do justice to either aspects.Set six months after the events of the first film, The Matrix Reloaded continues the rebellion of free humans against the machines & the journey of Neo in finding a way to end the war before it's too late. With only 72 hours remaining before an army of sentinels reaches Zion, it's up to Neo to find a way soon but standing in his way is an old foe who is now more powerful than ever before.Written & directed by the Wachowskis, the highly anticipated sequel is unfortunately no match to its predecessor & is a convoluted mess from start to finish that gets too carried away with its themes. However, there are still moments of great imagination in few sequences & the visual presentation is pretty neat as well. But it all doesn't stack up in the end & it largely remains a bloated, uninteresting affair.Cinematography somehow manages to maintain a level but is doesn't add anything to the groundbreaking feat it managed to achieve the last time. Editing isn't up to the mark for it is unable to provide a smooth flow & fails to trim moments that linger for way too long. VFX is a mixed bag as few effects-laden scenes look too cartoony while others are spellbinding. But Don Davis once again chips in with an amazing score.Coming to the acting department, there isn't a single performance worthy of mention & even the new additions bring nothing new to talk about. Action choreography ranges from borderline ridiculous to downright awesome, with my favourite sequence being Neo's fight with Merovingian's men which in my opinion is perfectly blended with other elements, especially the score, & despite being over the top, is incredibly exhilarating.On an overall scale, The Matrix Reloaded feels like a sequel written in hurry to cash-in on the success of the original. There are few interesting ideas present in its story but the film lacks the consistency & discipline when it comes to implementing them. It tries to do too much, throws a lot of questions at the viewers without offering any sort of explanation & lacks everything that made the first chapter an instant classic.",Null,0,1,26 November 2014
The Disaster Artist," A Heartfelt Ode To Fallen Artists & A Passionate Celebration Of Failure
","Embracing & celebrating Tommy Wiseau's vision (or lack of it) in an intimately human & heartfelt manner, The Disaster Artist is as touching as it is hilarious and is a genuinely wonderful ode to those fallen artists who dared to chase their dreams & passions without worrying about the repercussions.The Disaster Artist chronicles the making of one movie so bad that it is considered by many to be one of the worst ever. The plot follows Tommy Wiseau who befriends an aspiring actor and travels to L.A. with him to make their dreams come true but when Hollywood rejects them, they decide to make a movie of their own.Directed by James Franco, the film manages to find something of value within the production of 'the Citizen Kane of bad films' and ends up striking a deeper chord than expected. The whole underlining message regarding taking action & following your passion without caring about what others would say is honest & inspiring but that feeling doesn't last for long.The movie not only succeeds in duplicating the original's over-the-top moments with precision but also gets those minute details in the background down to a tee. Other times, it attempts to dig deeper into Wiseau's persona & viewpoint which helps us better understand, relate to & sympathise with his human flaws. But there are also stretches of fillers in between where the interest quickly fizzles out.Though Franco does a competent job behind the camera, it's his work in front of it that leaves the most lasting impression. Nailing Wiseau's mannerism to perfection, Franco delivers one of his best performances and plays Tommy Wiseau from inside out. Dave Franco, Seth Rogen, Allison Brie & others provide brilliant support in their given roles but The Disaster Artist is Franco's show from start to finish.On an overall scale, The Disaster Artist is less a parody & more a tribute to Tommy Wiseau's infamous movie, and has something in store for every viewer. Those who have seen The Room will be able to connect most of the dots but that doesn't mean the rest of the audience will find themselves lost, for this passionate celebration of failure is a fun-filled delight that has a real ability to amuse & entertain all. Definitely worth a shot.",Null,0,1,16 March 2018

","A devastating tale of three friends separated by a tragedy & reunited by another, Mystic River finds Clint Eastwood tackling the themes of friendship, loss, pain & revenge in this slow-burn mystery but the film's real highlight is the outstanding inputs from its ensemble.The story of Mystic River follows three men who were childhood friends once but have grown distant over the years. Their paths cross each other once again when one of them has a family tragedy, the investigation of which leads to conclusions that shatter each of their lives.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film is another solid effort from the actor-turned-director as he puts more emphasis on the characters at hand than other elements, which in turn gives the actors more room to make their mark. Its period setting & controlled camerawork add to the mood & mystery but the film still wavers in the middle.Performances are its strongest suit, for Sean Penn, Tim Robbins & Kevin Bacon are absolutely brilliant in their given roles and their chemistry with each other carries that required sense of a history. Penn delivers the finest performance of the three and is expertly supported by Robbins whose troubling portrait of a man still being haunted by his disturbing past leaves a solid impression of its own.On an overall scale, Mystic River is undoubtedly amongst Clint Eastwood's better directorial efforts and is by all means a skilfully crafted & finely narrated example of its genre but it could've made an even better impression with a tighter editing. Also, what Penn & Robbins manage to accomplish with their respective characters here pretty much overshadows everything else. And for that alone, Mystic River is worth a shot.",Null,0,0,22 March 2018

A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Movie. A Remarkable Performance.
","Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, A Beautiful Mind is an expertly crafted biopic based on the life of schizophrenic mathematician John Nash & covers his struggle with his condition. Although the artistic license taken here makes it far more cinematic than required, the film nonetheless succeeds as a touching, entertaining & satisfying experience.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of A Beautiful Mind begins in 1947 when the young John Nash arrives at Princeton University. Eccentric but brilliant, Nash graduates with flying colours, is hired by MIT but begins exhibiting troubling symptoms of a mental illness which in the long run affects not only his personal & professional life but also those around him.Directed by Ron Howard, A Beautiful Mind does many things right but purely as a biopic, it leaves out or alters the facts way too much for dramatic purposes. Also, Howard has always preferred to play the safe game, avoiding any bold risks & this film is no different. The technical aspects are finely carried out but where the film makes its biggest impression is in its performances.Featuring a reliable cast in Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Martin Hansen & others, A Beautiful Mind is bolstered by strong & sincere emotional performances from its cast with Crowe & Connelly impressing the most in their respective roles of John Nash & his wife Alicia. Also adding more strength in little doses is its warm cinematography, steady pacing & James Horner's elegant score.On an overall scale, A Beautiful Mind is a surprisingly moving cinema which despite being a bit manipulative remains highly entertaining & gripping from start to finish. Although the authenticity of its take on Nash's life & mental illness can be argued, its 135 minutes of story feels quite satisfying in the end. Definitely one of the best films of its year & certainly the one in the career of Crowe, Connelly & Howard.",Null,0,1,7 October 2013
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The Magic Continues...
","The on-screen adaptation of the sequel to Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone takes us on yet another whimsical journey of magic & wonders and covers Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Also, although it is a pretty faithful adaptation of its source material, it doesn't add anything new at all to the world we already witnessed in its predecessor and simply moves the story forward without providing any improved feeling of freshness or excitement.Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets begins with Harry Potter being warned by a house-elf against returning to Hogwarts which, as obvious, he ignores. With friendship getting stronger & rivalries becoming more intense, the second year is full of surprises for our young wizard but Hogwarts soon turns from Harry's safe haven into a gravely dangerous place when the Chamber of Secrets is mysteriously opened & more people end up getting petrified by a curse. And once again, it all comes down to Harry Potter to save the day.Directed by Chris Columbus, this sequel comes from the same cannon Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone came from, considering that there isn't any noticeable change in the film's outlook or feel. The screenplay follows J.K. Rowling's novel closely for the most part but it's a little tiresome affair this time & runs a little longer than it should have. Rest of the filmmaking aspects are mere re-enactment of the previous chapter although John Williams offers a more evolved score to go with the film's events.Coming to the performances, the child actors exhibit a little improvement in their given roles but there are moments featuring them that are still silly & annoying. Visual effects are a bit dated just like its predecessor and it just doesn't have the tension despite being a fairly grim story. Also, the climax is a bit too predictable, even for those who haven't read the book. Fortunately, not everything is bad here as the humour is wonderfully timed, the set pieces still hold up well & it boasts few impressive sequences.On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets can be argued as a better or weaker sequel to the first chapter but for me, this was simply an exercise in monotony that could've benefited from a slightly enhanced presentation. Alas, it still manages to keep the magic alive although the effect of the spell wearing off can clearly be noticed. Neither better nor worse but very much on the same scale as its predecessor in my opinion, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is worth a watch, at least once.",Null,0,1,17 July 2014
The Departed," A Rare Hollywood Remake That Outshines The Original In All Aspects
","Helmed by a master filmmaker in complete control of his craft, fuelled by a razor-sharp script that packs armour-piercing dialogues, and further bolstered by a star-studded ensemble that fires on all cylinders, The Departed is one rare Hollywood remake that outshines its original in all aspects, and ranks amongst the sharpest, slickest & most sophisticated examples of its genre.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film marks the 3rd collaboration between Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio and finds the duo working in better harmony than ever before. It is fast, it is foul-mouthed, it is furiously paced & it is frenetically thrilling. Easily the most entertaining film of Scorsese's career until then, the story exudes an unbridled energy that's unlike Scorsese's works yet exhibits his trademarks throughout.What makes The Departed so gripping & entertaining is that it never stops to take a breather and is always on the move. Several subplots are at play and it's all headed in the same direction at the same pace. DiCaprio impresses with another calculated input, Matt Damon is excellent as well, Martin Sheen & Mark Wahlberg are in prime form, and yet all of them are overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's formidable & show-stealing act.A dynamic blend of kinetic direction, explosive screenplay, energetic camerawork, cut-throat editing, breakneck pace, lively soundtrack & outstanding performances, The Departed is powerhouse storytelling that deftly merges style & substance into an expletive extravaganza that will delight both Scorsese fans & causal filmgoers. One of the best films of its year, one of Scorsese's finest, and one of the greatest remakes in existence, The Departed is genre filmmaking at its most vicious.",Null,0,4,14 January 2020
Psycho," Alfred Hitchcock's Magnum Opus
","Immortal for its contribution to cinema, notorious for pushing the boundary of what's accepted in mainstream movies & setting an extremely high benchmark for horror films to follow, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho remains the most influential, successful & famous work of his legendary career and is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest achievements in the history of filmmaking.The story of Psycho concerns Marion Crane; a secretary working at a real estate office who is entrusted with $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank but ends up absconding with it in order to start a new life. Caught in heavy rain & tired after a long drive, she pulls over to spend the night at Bates Motel whose owner-manager seems to be very much under the dominion of his mother.Throughout his career, director Alfred Hitchcock has enriched the world of cinema with some truly groundbreaking thrillers & despite that, Psycho feels like something of a first from him. It's his first stint with the genre of horror, it breaks through the barriers of censorship unlike any film before and over the years, it has played an major role in influencing not only films but pop- culture as well.The screenplay is a gem in itself for the story is cleverly written by Joseph Stefano & also features many memorable quotes. Filmed on a modest budget, the black-n-white cinematography only ends up working in favour of the film as it makes excellent use of sharp focus, smooth tracking shots & meticulous detailing in capturing its events, while also providing an ageless look to the whole story.Coming to the performances, the film features a reliable cast amongst which Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins end up impressing the most. While Leigh beautifully captures the guilty side of Marion, Perkins as Bates is show-stealing considering that he starts out pretty calmly but steadily levels it up as the story progresses & is absolutely chilling in the film's final moment.Editing is also worthy of its praise for it paces the whole story ingeniously & gets its own moment to shine in what happens to be the film's most (in)famous sequence. Yet, the maximum contribution amongst all aspects comes from Bernard Herrmann's spectacularly terrifying score which makes its presence felt from the very beginning & ends up intensifying the film's overall cinematic experience by a great deal.On an overall scale, with its tense atmosphere that looms over the plot from start to finish, outstanding direction, tight screenplay, superb performances, stunning grayscale photography, clever editing & relentless score, Psycho is a breathtaking work of perfection that marks the creative height of Alfred Hitchcock's glorious film career and not only is it the most influential example of its genre but is very much the sole reason why modern horror exists in the first place.",Null,0,1,14 October 2013
American Made," A Fun Lie Based On A True Story That's Casual, Cavalier & Carefree
","From the director of The Bourne Identity & Edge of Tomorrow comes a breezy & lighthearted biopic that's not only aware of the limitations it imposes on itself but is more than happy to work within those confinements. Definitely not aiming for much, it is a fun-filled delight that does what it set out to do.The story of American Made follows the life & exploits of Barry Seal, a former airline pilot who flew missions for the CIA before becoming a drug runner for the Medellín cartel during the 1980s. But playing for both sides has its consequences, and it all eventually comes crashing down for 'the gringo who always delivers.'Directed by Doug Liman, the film creates its own version of Barry Seal, using only snippets of his real-life exploits while imagining other events in a way that serves well to its entertainment purposes. The narrative unfolds at a swift pace, is always on the move, and Liman does well to keep the interest alive with its amusing tone & fun vibe.Its varying set pieces evoke the required timeline while its groovy camerawork & warm colour palette help add a tinge of warmth to its images. Editing makes sure the film remains an engaging ride, despite its weak plot & poor characterisation, and paces the plot brilliantly. And its score & incorporated songs add flavours of their own into the finished material.Coming to the performances, American Made rides heavily on Tom Cruise's flair, on-screen charisma & magnetic presence, and the actor does all in his power to steer the film past the finish line. His input has an energetic, jovial quality to it that makes us root for his shady character at times, and he's finely supported by the remaining cast, especially Domnhall Gleeson who plays a CIA officer.On an overall scale, American Made is a fun lie based on a true story that's casual & carefree, and works mainly due to Doug Liman's kinetic direction & Tom Cruise's dynamic poise. Better than what I expected even though I didn't expect much, it's a sunny, sparkling & serviceable ride that promises an enjoyable time and delivers it. Although not a memorable entry by any means, American Made is nonetheless worthy of a shot.",Null,0,1,2 January 2018
The Witch," A Soul-Shaking, Blood-Curdling, Skin-Crawling, Bone-Chilling & Nerve-Wracking Nightmare
","A soul-shaking, blood-curdling, skin-crawling, bone-chilling & nerve-wracking exercise in persistently looming dread, paranoia-inducing terror & never-ending nightmare, The Witch (stylized as The VVitch) is one of the best films I have ever seen and is destined to rank amongst the greatest works of 21st century cinema in the years to come.Set in 17th century, the plot concerns a family of devout Christians who are banished from their Puritan plantation and settle on the edge of a secluded wilderness where they build a sustainable life for themselves. But when their youngest mysteriously vanishes from the premises & crops fail, the family starts to crumble and is torn to pieces by an evil that lurks in the woods.Written & directed by Robert Eggers in what's actually his directorial debut, The Witch is one of the strongest debuts in recent memory as Eggers' direction exudes both passion & perseverance that one expects from an auteur. The writing is top notch too as Eggers fills his tale with believable characters and their finely scripted arcs only lends more credibility to its diabolical plot.Production design team create a sinister environment that reeks of evil, and the peripherals of the isolated surroundings only add more eeriness to the whole setting. Cinematography is a highlight, relying on natural light to imbue a sense of realism while its earthy tones, cold colour palette & controlled manoeuvring of camera inculcate an aura of foreboding that only magnifies as the plot thickens. Editing is methodically carried out, for every bit of its 93 minutes runtime plays a relevant role in the final outcome. Mark Korven's terrifying soundtrack further ups the ante by amplifying the tale's nightmarish element, thus catapulting the viewing experience to another level. Every single aspect works in perfect harmony under Eggers' supervision and brings to life a cinema that's as unique as it is unearthly.Coming to the performances, The Witch features a devoted cast in Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw & others, and they all chip in with commendable inputs. Taylor-Joy is an absolute revelation in her role and renders her character's increasing vulnerability with great effectiveness. But the real show-stealer is the goat named Black Phillip, and you have to see it for yourself to find out why.On an overall scale, The Witch is a deeply unnerving, extremely disquieting & powerfully affecting cinema that feels like it was crafted by the Devil himself. An absolute gem of genre filmmaking that's just as polished in the storytelling department as it is accomplished on technical scale, this ill-omened folktale is the best movie of its year, one of the finest films of the decade, and one of the genuinely great works of horror in recent memory.",Null,4,9,8 September 2017
Rosemary's Baby," Psychological Horror At Its Very Best.
","Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a masterwork of outstanding direction, polished screenplay & stellar performances that may lean towards the supernatural in small doses but what truly makes it an enduring masterpiece of its genre is the seamless manner in which it employs the psychological elements of horror filmmaking into its premise by creating a chilling sense of dread, paranoia & suspense over the course of its runtime.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Rosemary's Baby takes place in the year of 1966 and concerns a young couple; struggling actor Guy Woodhouse & his lovely wife Rosemary, who move into a notorious apartment building in New York and are gleefully greeted by their elderly but eccentric neighbours. The main plot concerns Rosemary's pregnancy as she becomes more n more paranoid & suspects her neighbours to be a part of an occult society.Written & directed by Polanski, the film marks his American film debut & he really couldn't have asked for a better start. Rosemary's Baby works as an effective thriller in the first watch but it's the next viewings where one truly discovers just how expertly the director has managed to make the smallest of details play a crucial role in shaping up the whole picture. Deftly scripted by Polanski in his first stint as a writer, the film follows the book very closely and is one of the most faithful adaptations in motion picture history.Cleverly shot from start to finish and employing excellent use of long takes & camera angles, Cinematography beautifully serves its purpose of encapsulating the entire feature with an eerie, tense & insecure atmosphere which escalates further as the film progresses. Editing is immaculately done as every sequence feels relevant to the plot. And the lullaby that bookends the film is a haunting piece while the other tracks have an unusual presence that ultimately works in favour of the film.Coming to the performances, Rosemary's Baby features a very reliable cast & benefits greatly from their committed performances. Mia Farrow is immensely convincing as Rosemary & her gaunt appearance only adds more flesh to her character. John Cassavetes doesn't get enough credit for his role but if one looks closely, his action kind of hints at the sinister ending this film has in store for the viewers. Sidney Blackmer & Ruth Gordon capture the essence of their characters in an authentic manner and the contribution from rest of its cast is no slouch either.On an overall scale, Rosemary's Baby remains one of the most unsettling films of all time that still hasn't lost much of its potency despite being over 45 years old & continues to reveal more of its brilliance on subsequent viewings. Its real strength lies in its ability to keep the viewers immersed into its intriguing story that wonderfully balances its elements without ever relying on any sort of gore or violence. And the final payoff is absolutely worth the wait. A laudable work of precision craftsmanship & a timeless classic in every sense of the word, Rosemary's Baby comes strongly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.",Null,0,2,14 October 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," Can Men & Women Be Friends Or Does Sex Always Get In The Way?
","From the director of Stand by Me, The Princess Bride & A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally is an elegantly crafted, cleverly composed & wonderfully narrated romance comedy that raises a pretty interesting question of if a man & a woman can just remain friends without sex coming in their way and also covers many other fascinating ideas about relationships with a zestful spirit & endless charm.The story of When Harry Met Sally follows its titular characters from the time they finish school & share a cross-country drive to New York City to the next 12 years or so when they keep bumping into each other on chance encounters, eventually become friends & try to help each other through the various hardships of their respective lives while unaware of the mutual feelings they have for each other.Amazingly well-directed by Rob Reiner, the film exhibits an immense charm from start to finish and also includes many brief segments of old couples telling us how they met each other which leaves a flavour of its own plus acts as a filler in between the various time leaps its story takes. Written by Nora Ephron, the various concepts of relationships are nicely presented with enough wit to keep it fresh in the viewers' conscious without halting its entertainment.Cinematography covers many beautiful locations in Manhattan which contrasts with the colourless lives its characters have been living, editing keeps the narrative smoothly flowing & the music department makes excellent choices in the selection of songs. Coming to the performances, both Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan are very impressive in their given roles and their on-screen chemistry feels incredibly natural & is sizzling with passion at the same time.On an overall scale, it's been 25 years since When Harry Met Sally was released on the big screen and yet, its magic hasn't diminished by one bit plus it continues to age like wine. Featuring one of cinema's most notable sequences followed by an even more memorable punchline, When Harry Met Sally is a film for the ages that will remain relevant no matter how many generations pass by it. Delightfully recommended.",Null,1,2,25 September 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," 'I'm the Motherf*cker Who Found This Place'
","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty may not be as highly accurate as it is advertised but it does contain all the potent & explosive elements that made The Hurt Locker, the Best Picture Oscar winner of its year. Right from the beginning until the very end, the film generates an unrelenting atmosphere of severe tension & throughout its runtime remains highly gripping, suspenseful, very well detailed & is a superbly crafted film.This is Kathryn Bigelow's most mature effort, much ahead of The Hurt Locker & her direction is very impressive. The writing is taut, very well-researched, finely detailed & nicely layered. The acting is brilliant as well with Jessica Chastain stealing the show with her intense knockout performance & the crew has tried to re-enact most of the events with as much authenticity as possible. Photographed in a documentary style, the film is finely edited & features a potent score too.Yet in spite of what's great about it, the film isn't devoid of flaws & there were two things that really disappointed me. First is the absence of 9/11 footage when it gloriously displayed all the other terrorists bombings in full scale and the final climactic scene which, in my opinion, should've been entirely filmed in the night vision camera technique instead of jumping out from that into absolute darkness.On an overall scale, Zero Dark Thirty may not be suitable for all viewers due to its explicit display of torture & grim atmosphere but there is also no denying that it's one of its year's best films which promises & delivers a nail-biting experience to its viewers.",Null,2,3,7 October 2013
Steve Jobs," Less An Adaptation & More A Work Of Fiction. Still, One Hell Of A Ride.
","Less an adaptation of Walter Isaacson's biography of the same name & more a work of fiction, Steve Jobs is anything but a just portrait of its titular character for all this biopic attempts to do is to depict the worst aspects of the late Apple co-founder by stuffing the plot with fictional, inaccurate segments that are only meant to further exaggerate his human flaws, and it is very much evident in the film's timeline for the plot is set around the young, immature & reckless years of Jobs' life and completely ignores the era in which he scripted the greatest second innings ever played.As a rendition of Jobs' real life, Steve Jobs is an absolute disaster. As a fictional story however, it's downright thrilling, tremendously entertaining & thoroughly riveting piece of storytelling that's viciously written by Aaron Sorkin, brilliantly directed by Danny Boyle, and strongly performed by its cast, especially Michael Fassbender & Kate Winslet. In actuality, it isn't even an adaptation of its source material as Sorkin only uses snippets from the book in his fabricated story that's filled with fictitious characters who are assigned real names, and employs made up moments to enhance its drama.The story of Steve Jobs is narrated in three segments, each set backstage & few minutes prior to the launch of an important product. The first act is set in 1984 and covers the behind-the-scene scenario before the unveiling of the Macintosh. The second act unfolds in 1988 and finds Jobs preparing for the NeXT Computer launch. And the third & final act takes place just before the premier of the iMac in 1998. The transitions are accompanied with montages which skim through the events that transpired between the two timelines. But what actually drives this feature is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, his friend Steve Wozniak & his confidant Joanna Hoffman.Directed by Danny Boyle, Steve Jobs is crafted with rigour, passion & enthusiasm and his energetic direction only adds extravagant flavours to its dialogue-driven plot, thus giving it a pageantry look n feel. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay brims with rapid-fire dialogues, memorable lines & engrossing conversations that keep the story on the verge of explosion at all times. Also, not only does Boyle attempt to do justice to Sorkin's magnificent script but actually celebrates it with all he's got. The narrative structure is undeniably impressive although the key product launch events Sorkin settles for is arguable. Another drawback is his one-sided approach in depicting Jobs as he only emphasises on Jobs' infamous attributes.The technical aspects are expertly executed with set pieces managing to recreate the ambiance of the locations where these iconic products were launched, albeit with a few unnecessary modifications. Each act is shot in a different film format (16 mm, 35 mm & digital), and the quality of its images only improve as the plot progresses. Cinematography also gives a distinct look to each act with its apt use of colour palette while the fluid but controlled movements of the camera make the drama more immersive. Editing is tight & immaculately carried out and its 122 minutes of runtime is marvellously paced. Finally, the soundtrack by Daniel Pemberton also follows the three-act structure, with different set of instruments for each segment.However, there's one more thing. Steve Jobs features an outstanding ensemble in Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen & Jeff Daniels, with more support coming from Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg & three other girls who play the role of Jobs' daughter Lisa in three different acts. Despite not an ounce of similarity in looks between the actor & the character he plays, Fassbender hits it out of the park with a really smashing performance as Steven Paul Jobs even if he's constantly challenged by Winslet who is always around to leave her own mark in the role of Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' right-hand woman. Rogen exhibits the good-natured personality of Steve Wozniak in a sensible manner, Daniels also does well as the infamous John Sculley, while all three girls chosen to play Lisa chip in with fine contributions.On an overall scale, Steve Jobs is nowhere close to bringing alive the life story of the greatest visionary of our time but it also succeeds as a masterwork of fiction filmmaking. While there are plenty of positives to be found in direction, acting, camera-work, editing & music, the only aspect that dominates it from beginning to end is Aaron Sorkin's screenplay, compared to which all other elements only play second fiddle. An unexpected delight of the year that, despite being unable to paint an accurate picture of its titular character, delivers a movie experience that's engaging from the first frame, gets more invigorating with every passing moment & finishes on a much rewarding note. Definitely one of the best films of 2015 that's spearheaded by Sorkin's razor-sharp script, Boyle's vibrant direction & Fassbender's compelling performance, Steve Jobs isn't what it claims to be but as a fictionalised account, it still makes up for one hell of a ride.",Null,0,3,28 December 2015
War of the Worlds," Incredible First-Half. Horrible Second-Half. Anti-Climactic Ending!
","With minimal amount of plot on paper, excess reliance on CGI for its moments of action & severe lack of character depth, Steven Spielberg's adaptation of H.G. Well's classic novel does feature the trademarks usually found in his adventure films, including the attempt for a larger-than-life entertainment yet no amount of visually striking images can make up for the poor storytelling on display here.Based on H.G. Wells' novel of the same name, War of the Worlds tells the story of a broken family that finds itself caught in a major catastrophe when the entire planet is invaded by aliens who come out of the ground in their tripods, unleash carnage on human population & effortlessly defeat the armed forces. The plot concerns Ray Ferrier; a divorced father who tries to protect his children under all circumstances.Co-written by David Koepp & directed by Steven Spielberg, War of the Worlds is part horror, part disaster, part sci-fi & part-thriller that had the potential to be a really good example of its genre(s) since the set up in the first half illustrates the best of Spielberg's talents but the moment the stage is set, everything only goes downstream from there and its ending is one hell of an anticlimax that's sure to leave most frustrated than satisfied.Production design team does put up some really impressive sets on screen, Camera-work is brilliantly carried out for the most part, Visual effects are the film's main highlight & scenes of destruction are a delight to look at, Editing paces the narrative expertly for a while only to screw up later, Sound is neatly executed, and the music department is handled by John Williams as always but his score in this feature is quite forgettable.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Miranda Otto, Justin Chatwin & Tim Robbins, and while Cruise is committed to his role, no one else seems to be. Fanning still does a pretty good job, Otto is rarely present, Chatwin is nothing special & all Robbins does is ham like crazy. And we also have Morgan Freeman in the role of the film's narrator because when he speaks, everyone listens n admires.On an overall scale, War of the Worlds spends far too less time on its story & characters, is more concerned with big-screen spectacle elements, and fails to hold the viewers' interest till the very end. Still, it does make up for an enjoyable one-time watch that thrills in bits n pieces and even though its ending sort of makes much sense & can be appreciated for its unconventionality, it's also everything a climax in any motion picture isn't supposed to be: an anticlimax.",Null,0,1,14 October 2013

12 Years a Slave," 'I Don't Wanna Survive. I Wanna Live.'
","Mankind has come a long way from just being another mammal to the self-proclaimed masters of the planet. But the one thing that has continued to accompany us throughout the course of our evolution has been our inhuman desire to submit others to our will. Slavery has existed since the dawn of man & continues to exist even today in all forms; be it forced labour, human trafficking or debt bondage. 12 Years A Slave takes us back to the days America is ashamed of & tells the story of Solomon Northup; a free-born Negro & skilled violinist living with his family in New York who, on the pretext of making more money, was brought to Washington D.C. in 1841 and was later deceived, kidnapped & sold into slavery.While narrating Solomon's plight from his bondage to his eventual release over a decade later, this film also paints a viciously devastating portrait of American slavery & isn't going to be an easy sit for everyone. Unflinchingly scripted by John Ridley & excellently directed by Steve McQueen who leaves no stone unturned to prove that slavery is the lowest form of how one human can exploit another, steadily photographed, sensibly edited, calmly scored & outstandingly well performed by a strong cast of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender & others, and each one of them have contributed greatly in delivering the year's strongest ensemble performance.Leading from the front is Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup in what is certainly a career- defining work that deserves all the praise it has garnered so far & more. Supporting him remarkably well are Lupita Nyong'o & Michael Fassbender and even the small cameos by Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano & Brad Pitt end up making a mark in this film. On an overall scale, 12 Years A Slave is an emotionally scarring cinema about one of the most barbaric events in mankind history and benefits greatly from McQueen's bold direction, unflinching script, historical accuracy & strong performances from its highly talented cast. There are always some films out there which deserve to be seen no matter how disturbing or upsetting their experience could be and 12 Years A Slave is definitely one of them.

Ice Age," Blue Sky Studios' Animation Debut Is Still Its Finest Work To Date.
","Establishing Blue Sky Studios as the new player in the computer animation arena after both Pixar & DreamWorks Animation had made their mark, Ice Age is a sensibly crafted, delightfully humoured & wonderfully narrated adventure comedy that packs in an interesting set of pre-historic characters, manages to be surprisingly touching on few occasions & is thoroughly amusing from start to finish.The story of Ice Age takes place during the advent of the titular global phenomenon and follows a woolly mammoth named Manny, a ground sloth named Sid & a saber-toothed cat named Diego who, after coming across a human child & ultimately deciding to return him to his tribe, embark on an exciting adventure while braving the harsh conditions & unexpected challenges of the worsening weather.Directed by Chris Wedge & Carlos Saldanha, Ice Age sets its lighthearted tone right within the opening segment that follows a squirrel's obsession with acorn and this side story keeps recurring throughout the movie to provide the comic relief. The main plot itself is brilliantly narrated, the characters are introduced without swaying from the main premise, and it has plenty of laughs in store for everyone.The relationship between the characters develops naturally, the computer animation appears a bit dated today yet it's top-notch for its time, the pre-historic animals are nicely designed & rendered on the screen, the cold colour palette, smooth camera-work, fine editing & adventurous score also helps in uplifting the experience while Ray Romano, John Leguizamo & Denis Leary chip in with fitting voice work.On an overall scale, Ice Age marks a promising start for Blue Sky Studios and delivers the goods in sufficient doses to succeed as an enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying picture that will appease the appetite of both kids & adults. Wonderfully balancing its moments of comedy with sincere drama, further strengthened by terrific chemistry between its three characters, and exploring the theme of friendship with genuine warmth, Ice Age is definitely worth a shot.",Null,1,1,12 April 2016

Also, with no good to counter the evil this time around, it is a full-on descent into madness & hysteria that viewers are either gonna detest or embrace wholeheartedly.Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, this standalone take on the origins of the iconic arch nemesis attempts to create his psychological profile by painting a grisly portrait of an unstable mind that's hanging by a thread on the edge of insanity until he finally snaps. Discarding the existing blueprint of its genre, this reincarnation of Joker offers a low-budget, grounded treatment but with hugely rewarding dividends.Though Phillips' direction could dig into Joker's unhinged persona to only a certain extent, Joaquin Phoenix's chilling rendition of the eponymous psychopath bridges the gap and overcomes the few nitpicks with thrilling intensity, for he is gripping & breathtaking throughout. Other vital inputs come from the story's nihilistic tone & treatment, its grim atmosphere, sudden brutal violence, and Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score.Scarier than most horror films of today, Joker bestows the notorious madman with an origin story that's as plausible as it is cold & callous, and makes for an insanely riveting character study that works even if one strips the premise off its comic book roots. Driven by Joaquin Phoenix's powerful, unsettling & memorable performance, this cautionary tale of a psychotic who in search for identity mistakenly becomes a symbol is arguably the best film of the year.",Null,9,19,10 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," One Of The Most Overrated Films Ever Made.
","Widely considered by many to be one of the finest films ever made, this so-called 'Greatest courtroom drama of all time' has only one segment set in the courthouse while the rest of it concerns a couple of annoying kids & their everyday life, which doesn't even have anything to do with the case. In addition to that, it's an insufferably boring film to sit through!Based on the novel of the same name, the story of To Kill A Mockingbird is set in a fictional American town during the 1930s and concerns a respected lawyer & his family who faces a backlash from his society when he agrees to defend a young black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Through the trial, the racial attitude in town's society is exposed.Directed by Robert Mulligan, it is surprising that the first half of the film doesn't even feature anything related to the case, which itself surfaces very late into the story. Maybe this movie isn't a courtroom drama after all, maybe it's more about the loss of childhood innocence & stuff like that but that's not what I was looking forward to after having heard so much praise about it.Set pieces do carry an authentic feel of its timeline & location. The whole drama is captured in crisp black n white and even the night scenes are brightly lit. Editing unfolds its story at a slow pace which becomes a pain to sit through if, like me, you were expecting a customary courtroom drama and ended up with whatever this is. However, its theme of how prejudice can blind an entire society is effectively handled.Coming to the performances, the cast of To Kill A Mockingbird comprises of Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, Brock Peters & Robert Duvall in what is his acting debut. Peck is definitely the show-stealer here for his performance as the righteous lawyer is very down- to-earth & impressive, plus that summation speech from him in the courthouse is an instant classic moment, but that same level of commitment is missing from the rest of the cast.Badham & Alford play the two kids whose journey this film is probably about but they utter their lines as if reading from a wall in front of them, that too with blank expressions. Peters does fine with what he's provided as Tom, the convicted black man. Duvall's debut work is nothing special for all he is supposed to do in this film is to show up at a particular moment & then disappear once again. However, Crahan Denton does justice to his white trash character.On an overall scale, To Kill A Mockingbird shouldn't even be classified as courtroom drama when it is something else entirely. Its #1 ranking in the AFI Top !0 Courtroom Dramas is the very reason why I was intrigued to check it out in the first place but to find that part in such a small dose & the story being more inclined towards those kids than the case at hand was both disappointing & frustrating. Overlong & tedious for the most part, this isn't the movie I was looking forward to. Greatest courtroom drama, my ass!",Null,4,10,9 September 2013
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Slightly Underwhelming But A Memorable Piece Of Work Nonetheless
","There's a lot to admire about The Bridge on the River Kwai. It's a grand production put together amazingly well by David Lean & benefits greatly from his composed direction, some wonderful performances as well as its expertly executed third act. Yet when compared to its near- unanimous praise, it turned out to be slightly underwhelming experience for me.The story of The Bridge on the River Kwai is set in a Japanese prison camp during the Second World War where the newly arrived British prisoners of war are ordered to construct a railway bridge; a task which is later overseen by their senior officer after his conditions are accepted but he's completely oblivious of the allies' plan to destroy it.Directed by David Lean, this is the second film of his that I've seen, first being Lawrence of Arabia & he really seems to have a knack when it comes to handling a huge cast. Production design work is breathtaking, camera-work is controlled, editing is what I've a problem with for the film felt overlong & its finely composed score has one really catchy piece.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins & others, and their performances are very good. Holden chips in nicely & also brings along the much appreciated humour. Hawkins enters the film quite late yet leaves his mark in the end. But this is Guinness' show all the way plus there's one scene showing him walking from one place to another & the way he did it, it's a classic moment right there.On an overall scale, it's not difficult to determine why The Bridge on the River Kwai is considered a memorable classic. It's enjoyable, entertaining & even rewarding but being a long film, it also requires a bit of patience. The final act is easily one of the best ones around for it is incredibly tense, ingeniously filmed & culminates the story on a stunning high. Even though the film didn't match my expectations, I've no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. Definitely worth a shot.",Null,0,1,18 January 2015
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," If He's Crazy, What Does That Make You?
","Exploring the theme of freedom against the confines of society, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of misfits challenging the morality of established order. With its universal appeal that has transcended time & space and simple, poetic storytelling amidst all the madness, this film, today, is widely regarded as one of world cinema's most respected & greatest films, and deservingly so.Jack Nicholson stars as Randal McMurphy, and if there ever has been a character that Nicholson was born to play, it's none other than the character of Randal. No one else could've pulled off Randal as effortlessly as Nicholson did & he was truly at his finest. Louise Fletcher highly impresses as Nurse Ratched, a character that is completely opposite of what McMurphy represents and the conflicts between these two entirely opposite characters is the defining core of this film, giving us some truly iconic moments.Bolstered by exceptional performances from its entire cast, brilliant direction from Milos Forman, wonderfully adapted screenplay from the novel of the same name and featuring a very unusual score, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an unforgettable story of hope & freedom that in spite of featuring one of cinema's most tear-jerking moments in its final moments wraps itself, as well as its viewers, up with a positive sense of hope.",Null,0,1,9 August 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," The Definitive Summer Blockbuster of 2014
","The summer of 2014 has already seen few behemoths in the form of Godzilla, X-Men: Days of Future Past & How To Train Your Dragon 2 but nobody was really expecting this Tom Cruise starrer, which debuted on the silver screen a few weeks ago without any significant buzz, to surprise them the way it has & with every passing moment, it continues to gain momentum with its strong 'word of mouth' praise.Edge of Tomorrow tells the story of Major William Cage who hasn't seen a day in combat but finds himself caught in a time loop after killed within minutes in a war against an alien race. But as he's forced to experience the same battle over n over again, his skill to handle the adversaries of war gets better and with the help of a Special Forces warrior, he ultimately gets closer & closer to defeating the seemingly invincible enemy.Director Doug Liman has made excellent use of the available resources here to craft an action film that's as smart & engaging as it is entertaining. The screenplay is inspired from the Japanese novel, All You Need Is Kill, and also infuses elements from cinema classics of the past to come out with an original storyline which is then further refined with clever use of action, wit, drama & unpredictability to deliver a cinematic experience that's highly rewarding.Coming to the technical aspects, cinematography expertly exhibits the director's filming trademarks & makes prevalent use of frequently cut hand-held shots. Editing is undoubtedly its finest aspect as not for once does its repeating segments feel dull or tiresome, VFX & sound are state-of-the-art stuffs that never take the viewer's focus away from the story and the background score ends up adding even more intensity & energy to the whole package.Edge of Tomorrow features an overall dependable cast amongst which Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt end up impressing the most. Playing his most challenging, funniest & meatiest role in a long time, Tom Cruise delivers a fabulous performance as William Cage but was constantly challenged by Emily Blunt who truly kicks ass with a ruthlessly aggressive rendition of her character, Rita Vrataski aka 'Full Metal Bitch'; the decorated veteran who guides & trains Cage after recognizing his current predicament.Although the film is no doubt an endlessly entertaining extravaganza, I still had few minor issues with it. One being the ending that isn't very fulfilling in accordance to its build-up & other is the inclusion of a romantic arc near the end which was absolutely unnecessary. Still, the positives outweighs the negatives by a huge margin as Edge of Tomorrow manages to get most things right & is the perfect summer blockbuster of the year with enough quality & quantity to dazzle most moviegoers.On an overall scale, Edge of Tomorrow is a smartly scripted, cleverly narrated, brilliantly directed, energetically photographed, tightly edited, timely humoured, wonderfully scored & strongly performed motion picture that may look like an action-laden video game but damn me if it isn't a remarkably well-played one by its cast & crew. If you still haven't seen it then cut the foreplay & just go for it before it completes its run on the big screen. You can thank me later.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,1,4,25 June 2014
Downfall," Unbelievable Realism. Exceptional Accuracy.
","Exhibiting relentless realism & exceptional accuracy on-screen, Downfall (also known as Der Untergang) recreates the events surrounding the final days of German dictator Adolf Hitler's life in the Führerbunker while also depicting the fall of the Third Reich & Berlin during World War II. The film is bookended by excerpts from the real-life Traudl Junge, Hitler's final secretary, and the plot itself is derived from her accounts.The best thing about Downfall is that it keeps the human characteristics of the Führer intact & boldly defies the conventional portrayal of Hitler in media, which was controversial as expected but in my opinion is a brave, respectable & important attempt. What's even more surprising is that by taking this humane approach, the film is able to evoke sympathy & pity from its viewers for someone considered by many to be the most evil person to have ever lived.Contrary to what one might expect, Downfall neither glorifies Adolf Hitler nor Nazism. In fact, it presents the Führer as a completely degraded, broken down & delusional shell of a human being trying to win an already lost cause. The film also exhibits just how profoundly deep rooted & blind was the faith & loyalty of Hitler's followers in him & his ideals as we see many committing suicide for they couldn't digest the idea of living in a world without National Socialism.With great emphasis on showing the value of a human life, whether evil or not, the direction by Oliver Hierschbiegel is an absolute class. Screenplay is pure gem from start to finish. Production design has done a fabulous job here to perfectly recreate the 1940s atmosphere of war-torn Berlin. Cinematography captures every frame in meticulous detail. Editing makes sure every single scene is relevant to the film. And music often goes unnoticed here but it's an integral part of the film.Coming to the performances, Bruno Ganz delivers one of decade's strongest & most haunting performances as Adolf Hitler and from mannerisms to fits of tirade, he gives us the most convincing & authentic portrayal of Führer in media, so far. Alexandra Maria Lara plays Traudl Junge with fine elegance while the rest of the casting is near-perfect too as each actor highly resembled their real-life characters & played them splendidly well. It's a film with powerful performances & every single one of them has delivered.Extremely well researched, beautifully detailed, brutally accurate, insanely realistic & highly gripping from start to finish, Downfall tries to remove our assumption that only inhuman monsters are capable of doing terrible things & shows that how even the most charming men can manage to seduce a whole lot of into barbarism. A German film about the fall of Berlin that places Adolf Hitler in the central role? This isn't just a landmark moment for cinema but for Germany itself.On an overall scale, Downfall is a profoundly moving motion picture & a significant masterpiece that would easily find its place amongst world cinema's greatest films & is arguably the best to come out from Germany. One of the most flawless works of 21st century in my opinion and a perfectly crafted historical account that needs to be shown in schools & universities around the world, this unique take on the most feared dictator of all time is a must watch for everyone. Extremely recommended.",Null,3,5,9 August 2013

The Wolf of Wall Street," Best Scorsese-DiCaprio Film To Date
","A downright hilarious, unabashedly entertaining & riotously fun ride that presents both Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio in prime form, The Wolf of Wall Street is a masterly directed, sharply scripted & expertly acted biopic that chronicles the remarkable journey of Jordan Belfort from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption & federal government.Stylishly directed by Scorsese in what's his 5th collaboration with DiCaprio, this is arguably his best film to date and certainly the most enjoyable of them all. A tale of debauchery that's consistently high on money, parties, sex & drugs, the picture is gripping from the get go and sustains its manic energy & irreverent humour for most of its runtime but what keeps it alive is the auteur's assured craftsmanship.Further uplifting the viewing experience is the excellent production design, sharp camerawork, neat editing, breakneck pace, fab costumes, dynamic score & stellar performances. Leading from the front is DiCaprio who utilises every bit of his on-screen charisma & acting prowess to deliver his career-best work. Jonah Hill is a revelation too, playing Belfort's sidekick with elan. And they are well supported by the rest of the cast.Overall, The Wolf of Wall Street is an endlessly funny & deliberately unrestrained exercise in excess that promises 3 hours of non-stop extravaganza and finds both the master & his protégé delivering on all fronts. An infectious & intoxicating film that's high & hyper from its opening moments yet continues to snort more white powder every 5 mins, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the finest films of its year, one of the best examples of its kind, and certainly the most memorable one from Scorsese & DiCaprio so far.",Null,1,1,18 January 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Crazy Riot from Start to Finish.
","I won't deny that I had no expectations at all from The Wolf of Wall Street. Martin Scorsese's films rarely work for me & the trailer for this one made it look like a cinema about party, sex & drugs on loop for 3 long hours. And The Wolf of Wall Street was exactly that. Booze, party, sex & drugs on loop for 3 hours and yet, I ended up really enjoying it & the biggest plus, never got bored for even a second, something that rarely happens when I'm watching this director's works. But this biopic of the infamous stockbroker Jordan Belfort has a lot of energy & madness written over it & is a crazy riot from start to finish.Although a biopic, The Wolf of Wall Street is actually a film about excess. Excess of everything; be it drugs, money or women. It's vulgar. It's loud. It's dirty. It's funny. Actually, calling it funny doesn't do real justice because it's downright hilarious. And it's extremely entertaining. There is so much in the film that could've gone terribly wrong & would've turned it into a complete disaster but Scorsese's assured direction has masterfully rescued this overdosed cinema from passing out completely. And if Scorsese's direction is brilliant, then the lead performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as the stock market maniac, Jordan Belfort, is absolutely show-stealing & one of the best performances of the year plus he is exuberantly supported by Jonah Hill who makes an impression of his own as Donnie; Belfort's sidekick.I think there is also a need to stress that this isn't a film that'll work for everyone. It never takes itself seriously and in a way, that's both a plus & minus for this film. What is going to work for one probably won't for another & what you want to watch in it is the criteria which will decide whether you'll love it or hate it. On an overall scale, thanks to Scorsese's stylish direction, hilarious script, clever use of music & insane performances by the cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on dope but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes and, despite all the bullshit that this cinema is full of, it still finishes as one of the finest & most entertaining films of 2013.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,2,6,10 January 2014
It Chapter Two," Barely Manages To Float
","The best thing about It: Chapter One wasn't Pennywise but The Losers Club. It was their natural chemistry, strong dynamic, bonding & rapport that made us invest in the story. And then, the finely executed horror bits & wicked act from Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd uplifted the film further. It was funny, fresh & frightening, and paved a solid platform for It: Chapter Two which unfortunately is unable to deliver the smart, sophisticated & satisfying experience its predecessor offered in spades.Directed by Andy Muschietti, the sequel follows Stephen King's novel more closely yet features an overlong & bloated premise whose runtime is strongly felt. The first act is interesting, plus The Loser Club reunion has the same vibe that their younger selves did. But once the board is set, things only head downhill as Muschietti loses his grasp on our attention, is unable to utilise the resources properly this time, and ends up delivering a rather inferior & underwhelming product.Clocking at 169 mins, what makes the ride difficult is its inconsistent pace. Also, the horror aspects are dumbed down, for most of the scares fall flat or seem childish & silly in comparison to last entry. Add to that, the final showdown does not live up to the hype either. The only aspect that retains its sharpness is its humour, mainly coz of Bill Hader who, like his younger counterpart, impresses the most. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd does all he can to portray the demented & fiendish side of Pennywise but it isn't enough this time.On an overall scale, It: Chapter Two fails to make the most of the strong foundation of the first film, and is an occasionally thrilling & intermittently entertaining follow-up that never unlocks its full potential. Falling short in many things that its predecessor excelled at, it is a disappointing mess that lacks imagination in its scares, creativity in its approach & sincerity in its craftsmanship. Where Chapter One was brought to life with heart, passion & honesty which in turn made it soar, Chapter Two is simply dull, meandering & barely manages to float. What a shame!",Null,1,2,24 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Coens' Love Letter To Classic Hollywood Cinema Is Unexpectedly Underwhelming
","From the duo filmmakers whose works span numerous genres & styles, and include some of the boldest American films released in the past few decades, it's no surprise that many were expecting Hail, Caesar to be an instant classic and although it does have all the hallmarks of a Coen brothers film, it isn't as laudable as their finest efforts.The story of Hail, Caesar! takes place in the 1950s and follows Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood fixer for Capitol Studios whose job is to keep the scandalous private lives of celebrities out of the press so that their public image isn't harmed. However, when the lead star of the studio's major production is abducted, Eddie ends up dealing with a lot more than just fix.Written, produced, edited & directed by Joel & Ethan Coen, Hail, Caesar! is a wonderful throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood as the movie skims through productions of historical epics, period dramas, westerns, musicals & what not while narrating its own story, which doesn't pack in enough strength to capture & hold one's attention, and fails to stimulate the senses.There are a few good laughs here & there but for the most part, it isn't as amazing as its previews suggested. Only one character's arc is fully-fleshed, and as for its numerous homages & parodies, it not only includes the old classics but also many sub-par films of the bygone era. Nostalgia runs high here but the film's main premise doesn't have enough flesh on the bone.However, the technical aspects are brilliantly executed. Production design team does a terrific job with the set pieces, each exquisitely carved & meticulously detailed, and also succeeds in creating an authentic 1950s film production studio ambiance. Cinematography further enhances the whole imagery with its deft use of warm colour palette, the pacing is steady while the score & songs sync nicely with the unfolding events.Coming to the performances, Hail, Caesar! has quite an ensemble in Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & others. Brolin stays true to his fixer character and delivers a strong performance, Clooney is funny as expected, and Tatum deserves a mention for steering through that ingeniously choreographed musical number with stunning effortlessness.On an overall scale, Hail, Caesar! features many idiosyncrasies that one has come to expect from the Coens but the laugh-out-loud moments here are few & far in between. Neither the plot nor the characters are compelling enough and there isn't much to ponder once the credits start rolling. It does work as Coens' love letter to Classic Hollywood cinema but as a comedy & mystery, it's quite stale & stays on the same level. In a sentence, underwhelming.",Null,0,2,4 July 2016
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Uninspiring. Uninvolving. Unnecessary.
","Far too juvenile to appeal to anyone other than kids, the fourth instalment in the Ice Age series is a clear evidence that the studio should've stopped after the last chapter instead of inflating the saga mindlessly for the bubble finally bursts with this latest entry that is as dull & lifeless as sequels get.The story of Ice Age: Continental Drift follows Manny who along with Sid & Diego is separated from his family following the breakup of their continent, inadvertently caused by Scrat during his pursuit of the prized acorn, and soon find themselves captured by sea pirates while trying to return home.Co-directed by Steve Martino & Mike Thurmeier, Continental Drift begins well but the story fizzles out of gas way sooner than expected and for the most part, it is a chore to sit through. The plot is just meh, the original characters feature no interesting arcs while the new additions are a tad too annoying.The animation still retains its crisp quality & sharpness but the camera is more focused on the 3D experience than the story or characters, Editing is lame, most of its attempts at humour fall apart, and the only thing that manages to stay consistent with its predecessors is Scrat's stroke of bad luck.On an overall scale, Ice Age: Continental Drift is an uninspiring, uninvolving & unnecessary entry in the saga that takes little elements from the first three films but fails to execute the winning formula this time. Exhibiting signs of weariness & massive downgrade in pretty much everything, it is an absolutely bland & empty experience that easily goes down as the weakest chapter of the series, thus far.

The Green Mile," One Of Modern Cinema's Finest Tearjerkers.
","From the director of The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile is yet another poignant, touching & thoroughly gratifying prison drama that's patiently crafted, skilfully narrated & brilliantly performed and even though it's no match to Frank Darabont's 1994 masterpiece, it does carry an emotional weight that makes it one of cinema's finest tearjerkers.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, the story of The Green Mile is set during the 1930s and concerns a prison officer in charge of death row inmates at a penitentiary. The plot covers his & others guards lives' which is greatly affected when they find out that their newly arrived prisoner, a giant African-American man, is gifted with supernatural powers.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, the film marks yet another adaptation of a Stephen King's novel by the filmmaker and once again, he has transformed it beautifully on the silver screen. The screenplay also deserves a mention for it takes care of the smallest of details & always keeps the focus on its characters. Plus, there is ample amount of character depth to be found here.Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera in capturing the usually repetitive, dull & still life of prison and the warm colour tones are precisely executed. The passage of time in the prison is strongly felt in the film's own 188 minutes of runtime but it never becomes an chore for the drama is too absorbing & rich in content. Thomas Newman once again chips in with an evocative score and it only gets better as the film nears its finale.Coming to the performances, The Green Mile features a reliable cast in Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell & others, and their contributions lift the drama up by a great extent. Hanks is once again at his usual best but it's Duncan who steals the show with a truly heartbreaking performance and the scenes between him & Hanks are a treat to watch. Morse is good, Hutchiston nicely sells his sadist character & Rockwell does fine in his cameo.On an overall scale, The Green Mile is a wonderfully balanced motion picture that somehow manages to make its long runtime work in its favour. Sure it gets overly sentimental at times but none of those moments appear as a desperate attempt to move the viewers but genuine progression of the story. Also, the seamless blend between its supernatural elements & realistic setting allows the viewers to accept the story as it is without question and the film as a whole remains a gripping, heart-rending & emotionally shattering fable that's definitely worth your time & money.",Null,0,2,13 June 2015
Jaws," 40 Years On, Still A Haunting Masterpiece.
","Widely regarded by critics & viewers alike as one of the greatest, scariest & most influential films of all time, Jaws is Steven Spielberg's breakthrough feature that didn't only catapulted his career to great heights but also ended up establishing the modern Hollywood business model by becoming the first blockbuster in cinema history.Set in a fictional Amity Island, the story concerns a town sheriff, a marine scientist & a local fisherman who team up to hunt down a gigantic great white shark which has been terrorizing their small island community but once they set out to sea, they only end up discovering themselves as the ones who are being hunted by the great white.Produced on low budget, the masterful creativity of director Steven Spielberg is at full display here as he didn't only film it with great emphasis on plot & development but brilliantly amplified the tension as well by not explicitly showing us the shark for the majority of its runtime while not denying its presence either and when he did show it, it made many jump off their seats.Also supporting great direction is this film's tense screenplay, honest performances from its entire cast, great use of camera, superb editing and finally, the biggest contributor in turning Jaws into an absolutely bone-chilling experience, John Williams' tense score which elevated the horror to new heights & made the film twice as effective.Nearly 40 years have passed since this fright classic hit the screen & yet, even after countless imitations, it retains its ability to frighten the viewers with the same fervour as it did in the 1970s. A haunting masterpiece that made an entire generation afraid of ever stepping into the ocean again, Jaws has very effectively managed to stand the test of time & will hopefully continue to do so for many more decades.Immortal for its contribution to the genres of horror & suspense and a watershed moment for cinema itself, this unforgettable chiller remains one of Steven Spielberg's finest achievements in the film industry and without a shadow of a doubt comes highly recommended.",Null,3,6,8 November 2012
The Wrestler," The Wrestler is Mickey Rourke's Show, From Start to Finish.
","Filmed like a documentary, elegantly blending art n entertainment & taken to a whole new level by Mickey Rourke's career-resurrecting performance, The Wrestler is a wonderful testament to the incredible sacrifices so many professional athletes continue to make on a daily basis just for the sake of entertaining us, and is one of the best films of its year & Aronofsky's career.The story of The Wrestler concerns Randy 'The Ram' Robinson; a washed-up professional wrestler who continues to cling on to his career despite his failing health with the hope of reliving the glory of his prime days. But when his condition worsens, he tries to settle with an alternate career outside the ring only to struggle with it & also attempts to mend his relationship with his estranged daughter.Darren Aronofsky's direction is very impressive, screenplay is always focused on its lead character, cinematography & editing are in stealth mode compared to his previous features, fight choreography is excellent, Mansell's music doesn't have much of a presence this time yet is still effective in small doses but frankly, it's the performances that are the strongest aspects of this feature.Presenting a fascinating cast in Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei & Evan Rachel Wood, it's Rourke who dominates the screen with a powerfully affecting performance that's as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking. Fusing elements of his own life with his on-screen persona, the sadness & emptiness he's able to bring into his work is absolutely mind-blowing and the film is totally his show from start to finish.On an overall scale, covering the themes of passion, obsession, regret, sorrow, emptiness & redemption, The Wrestler is another effective drama from Darren Aronofsky that is a reflection of Mickey Rourke's own life brought alive on-screen. Being a wrestling fan myself who grew up enjoying the greatest era of WWE (Attitude Era, of course), The Wrestler is somewhat special for not just in wrestling fans around the world but also the wrestlers we grew up cheering for.",Null,0,0,12 October 2013
Kong: Skull Island," A Wasted Opportunity That Offers Nothing New In Its Retelling Of The Legend of Kong
","After bringing the 'King of Monsters' back to cinematic life in 2014, Legendary Pictures turns its attention to another behemoth to further solidify its own cinematic universe of super-species but all of it doesn't amount to much in the end, for Kong: Skull Island offers nothing new in its retelling of the legend of the giant ape.Kong: Skull Island follows a team of scientists & soldiers who, just before the end of Vietnam War, secure the U.S. government funding for the expedition of an uncharted island in the South Pacific but when they reach there, they encounter a 100-foot tall bipedal ape who destroys their choppers and leaves them dispersed & stranded in the unmapped territory, thus turning the survey job into a survival race.Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the first act of Kong: Skull Island is its strongest, for the premise is expertly set up and the efficient handling of its ominous vibe & sense of foreboding evokes keen interest. But once all our characters are on the island and the main plot is set into motion, it loses momentum as Vogt-Roberts fails to juggle multiple subplots properly and is unsure whether to go for a lighthearted, fun-filled extravaganza or a serious & dark monster flick.Production design team imbues a sense of mystery & danger to the exotic place with its set pieces. Cinematography attempts to duplicate the haunting aura of Apocalypse Now with its radiant colour palette, skillful use of lighting & shadows but succeeds only in bits n pieces. Slow-mo camera-work is finely utilised during the first encounter with Kong but is ultimately overdone in the end. Editing is a mixed bag, VFX has its share of strengths & flaws while Henry Jackman's score is serviceable.Coming to the performances, Kong: Skull Island features a talented ensemble in Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman & John C. Reilly, with Terry Notary providing the motion capture work for the eponymous ape. Hiddleston is alright as the mercenary, Larson does nothing but take photographs & act surprised, Goodman is completely wasted in his role, Jackson plays himself while Reilly is mostly annoying, plus the excessive focus on his character was totally unwarranted.On an overall scale, Kong: Skull Island is just as mediocre an entry in Legendary's MonsterVerse as Godzilla but it does feature more monster mayhem, even if those brief battles never manage to be engrossing or emotionally fulfilling. Characterisation takes a backseat, its lame attempts at humour fall flat, most creative choices don't work out in the film's favour and, in addition to all that, there is pretty much nothing in it that we haven't seen before. Falling short on all scales, Kong: Skull Island is a wasted opportunity that neither understood its true potential nor looked up to see what was up for grabs.",Null,5,11,24 March 2017

Tolkien's The Hobbit eventually finishes as another trilogy in the Middle- Earth saga despite the fact that unlike The Lord of the Rings, this novel could've easily worked out as a single feature & certainly wasn't vast enough to warrant three films; a mistake that became pretty evident when the first chapter was criticized by many for its bloated length.For me however, An Unexpected Journey was still an impressive commencement of The Hobbit film series for it closely followed the events of the book, kept the changes within the realms of Tolkien's spirit & was a largely satisfying cinematic experience despite its obvious flaws. The journey downward began with The Desolation of Smaug which absolutely slaughtered the novel in a manner that was plainly insulting to Tolkien & added even more insult to injury by abruptly ending at one of cinema's most frustrating cliffhangers.And so after a wait of another year, we come to the third & final instalment of The Hobbit film series but instead of a satisfying closure, what we get is a terribly written & horribly executed premise inflated to epic proportions which, apart from confirming that expanding this single-film story into three features was indeed a stupid move by the filmmakers, also brings the Middle-Earth franchise to its all-time low for there is nothing in this second sequel that works out in its favour.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies begins with what should've been the ending of The Desolation of Smaug but wraps up the fiery wrath of Smaug even before the film's subtitle appears on the screen. The plot then follows Bilbo Baggins & the Company of Dwarfs who after reclaiming their kingdom prepare for an impending war against elves n men who just want their share of the treasure but when a greater threat arrives at the Lonely Mountain, they all are left with a choice to unite against the common enemy or be destroyedHelmed by Peter Jackson for one last time, the final chapter in the Middle-Earth saga is also the weakest as the director completely abandons all the core elements of storytelling to rely solely on a series of eye-popping visuals & CGI-laden battles to carry its story forward. The screenplay continues the slaughter of its source material by stuffing the narrative with needless fillers while the remaining contents of the book are either presented in an overly exaggerated fashion or discarded in its entirety.Coming to the performances, it's only Martin Freeman & Ian McKellen as Bilbo Baggins & Gandalf the Grey, respectively, who leave a better impression than the others but then their role is somewhat limited in the finished product. The most unexpected disappointment comes from Richard Armitage who played Thorin Oakenshiled amazingly well in the previous two chapters yet here he seems pretty much clueless for the most part & delivers a laughable performance.The supporting characters are handled so poorly by the writers that even after three films, which totals over eight hours of runtime, many might still struggle in recalling the correct names of all the dwarfs. The first half of the film also deals with the corrupting power of greed which is pretty ironic considering that the very existence of this third chapter is a result of greed on the part of its creators. The only thing that doesn't disappointment in any manner is Howard Shore's score.On an overall scale, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is far from a fitting conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy & is a disappointment in every manner. Poorly directed, terribly written, needlessly bloated, overflowing with excessive CGI, lacking in substance & featuring some cringeworthy performances, there's so much one can complain about this finale but where this film or The Hobbit trilogy as a whole fails is exactly where The Lord of the Rings triumphed gloriously; its faithfulness to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.",Null,17,35,18 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Only Episode In Star Wars Prequel Trilogy That's Tolerable!
","Taking into consideration just how unbelievably insipid, downright detestable & excessively cartoonish both The Phantom Menace & Attack of the Clones were in all possible manners, the sixth instalment in the Star Wars saga & the final chapter of the prequel trilogy is a huge leap that exhibits massive improvements in various filmmaking aspects and is unreservedly the only prequel episode that's enjoyable, entertaining & somewhat satisfying.Set three years after the events of Attack of the Clones in a galaxy far, far away, the story of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith finds Jedi Knights leading the clone army in the war against the Separatists and chronicles Anakin Skywalker's eventual fall to the dark side of the Force. The plot follows Anakin whose faith in the Jedi is dented after he is denied the rank of Jedi Master by the Council and ultimately yields to the dark side when the Sith Lord reveals himself.Written & directed by George Lucas, it took him two terrible episodes to finally get rid of all the rustiness that had set in over the years but he at last delivers with Revenge of the Sith, which is the best constructed, finely edited & sensibly narrated story of the three. Showing some signs of life in his direction, Lucas turns his last chapter into an action-packed finale that fans of this franchise had always wished for and its larger-than-life action is, despite a few nitpicks, emotionally engaging.Being the final entry in Lucas' Star Wars saga, there is a sense of hurriedness in its pacing, which allows the story to be tightly-knitted but not all the mistakes of its predecessors are corrected for there were still some wrong turns taken & bad decisions made but for the first time, emotions come into play in the narrative. And it was good to see Lucas at last putting greater emphasis on the story & allowing the then-spectacular visuals to take it to the next level, something he should've done from the start.The set pieces look less artificial than before, most CGI creatures are still laughable to look at, the technical aspects don't seem to be scattered all over the place this time for there is actually an attempt to make it all work together to move its story forward and to an extent, it even succeeds. Its 140 minutes of runtime is still a tad too long but there's a whole lot of interesting moments to keep the viewers around, such as the execution of Order 66 or the final climactic duel or the completion of Anakin Skywalker's story arc.John Williams also chips in with what's arguably the finest soundtrack of the prequel trilogy which remains in sync with the unfolding events. Coming to the performances, the reprising cast returns to play their respective characters for one last time but just like it was the case in earlier entries, the acting remains weak. Hayden Christensen sucks as Anakin Skywalker and almost ruins the whole show, which is a shame considering that there was some weight added to his character this time. Ewan McGregor, however, does well with what he's given.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith is an unexpected surprise that turns out to be much better than anticipated, is easily the finest episode in the prequel Star Wars trilogy, and in bits n pieces is able to redeem whatever little was left redeemable by the epic disasters that were first two episodes. Frankly, this would've been a fairly good trilogy if George Lucas wasn't so overly occupied with the fancy creatures & digital effects, and by the time he realised that, it was already too late and the damage was done. In short, Revenge of the Sith is the only episode in Star Wars prequel trilogy that's tolerable.",Null,1,10,20 December 2015
The Lion King," The Greatest Disney Film Of All Time.
","One of the greatest films ever made, The Lion King is the very pinnacle of Disney's Renaissance Era that didn't just mark a creative high for the legendary animation studio but remains their most impressive work to date. An astounding masterpiece for all ages that's perfectly balanced in the smallest of aspects & still hasn't aged a day, this is without a doubt the greatest Disney film of all time.Set in the Pride Lands of Africa, The Lion King tells the story of a young lion prince who flees into exile after the death of his father when his uncle tricks him into believing that he is the one responsible for the king's demise. Growing up with two outcasts & embracing their carefree attitude, he is ultimately forced to confront his past after a chance encounter with an old friend & decides to return to his homeland.Directed by Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff, the film opens on such a grand note that its prologue alone is much better than most features turn out to be in their entire runtime. The whole story has an epic feel to it despite its grounded simplicity, the plot unfolds like a soothing breeze, the themes are handled with care, entertainment is top-notch and its carefully carved out characters add even more richness to the story.Each frame of its beautifully rendered animation is a work of spellbinding craftsmanship. Characters are brilliantly sketched too & do manage to express emotions amazingly well. Cinematography makes expert use of colour palettes & vibrant use of camera. Editing provides a frenetic pace to the whole narrative & is at its best during the musical numbers, while CGI is seamlessly integrated into its hand-drawn imagery.Although nearly every character in the picture has a well-defined arc, what makes them so much fun is the pitch-perfect voice cast that infuses new life into these characters & provide them their very own souls. James Earl Jones brings a king-like imposing quality to Mufasa, Matthew Broderick does well as Simba, Jeremy Irons is thrilling as Scar while both Nathan Lane & Ernie Sabella steal the show as Timon & Pumbaa with their impeccable timing & perfect chemistry.And last but not the least, I'd like to talk about its magnificent score. Composed by Hans Zimmer who was just starting out back then, the exquisitely arranged & masterfully orchestrated score elevates what was already an incredibly fascinating tale to such a grandeur level of epicness that even today, it remains the finest use of music in any animation feature out there. And further strengthening this aspect are catchy songs written by Tim Rice & Elton John.On an overall scale, The Lion King is an extraordinary blend of a highly gripping story, deftly written screenplay, state-of-the-art animation, cleverly drawn characters voiced by wisely chosen cast, terrific use of humour, skillful camera-work, tight editing as well as an outstanding score plus sensational songs, all of which work in seamless harmony in order to set an entirely new benchmark for its medium & effortlessly succeed.An emotionally stirring adventure that's full of heart, passion & creativity from start to finish, The Lion King is an unabashedly hilarious, occasionally melancholic, extremely intimate, thoroughly enjoyable, delightfully engaging, intensely thrilling, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying fable about life, death, identity, responsibility & resurrection that borrows from William Shakespeare's Hamlet yet is able to carve out its very own identity before it is finished.Marking the last great high for Disney's Renaissance Era that came crashing down soon after the advent of Pixar Animation Studios, The Lion King is a work of cinematic perfection that still stands tall & remains unblemished by the test of time and, for the epic this timeless classic is in every sense of the word, will continue to do so comfortably for a very foreseeable future. Absolutely worth your time & money, the crown jewel of Walt Disney Animation comes one hundred percent recommended.",Null,4,6,5 October 2013
Inception," A Labyrinth of Dreams & A Cinematic Maze of Sheer Intellect.
","A labyrinth of dreams & a cinematic maze of sheer intellect that beautifully balances its narrative complexity with spectacle for nearly 150 minutes, Inception is incredibly satisfying on both visceral & intellectual scale. It's an intriguing, exhilarating & brilliantly crafted sci-fi thriller that's equally smart & innovative in almost all filmmaking departments. Nolan's magnum opus?

Murder on the Orient Express," Sumptuously Produced. Technically Polished. Narratively Dull & Uninteresting.
","Furbished with polished attire, neat cinematography, star-studded ensemble & a moustache that overshadows everything, the second feature film adaptation of Agatha Christie's famous novel is a sumptuously produced mystery thriller that's narrated in a dull, uninspiring & uninteresting fashion.The story of Murder on the Orient Express follows the investigation that's set into motion when a passenger is found brutally murdered on the train. Handling the case is celebrated detective Hercule Poirot who deduces that the killer is still on board and tries to solve the mystery before the train reaches his destination.Directed by Kenneth Branagh, the movie follows the book closely yet is unable to create moments of genuine interest & nail-biting tension. Characters are poorly written & thinly sketched. The only thing that stands out about Hercule Poirot is his moustache. And further bogging down the plot are its clichéd elements & lack of suspense.But the film is refined in technical aspects, at least to an extent. Its period setting is finely illustrated. Camerawork is crisp, the images retain their sharpness at all times, and also benefit from its apt use of colour palette & lighting. Editing is a misfire, for the story isn't tightly knitted and twists lack the element of surprise. And the background score is serviceable at best.Coming to the performances, Murder on the Orient Express packs an impressive ensemble in Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe & Johnny Depp, and they all chip in with forgettable inputs. Still, it's not entirely their fault, for they had paper-thin material to work with and while Branagh gets the most screen time, he fails to make the most of it.On an overall scale, Murder on the Orient Express is interesting in bits n pieces but for the most part, there is nothing about it that leaves a lasting impression. Script is the main culprit while Branagh's direction is missing the required creativity, and the sum of it results in an adaptation that's faithful yet mediocre & unstimulating. Casual moviegoers probably won't mind its shortcomings but it could've been so much more had it gotten everything right.",Null,1,1,13 February 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes For 21st Century Filmgoing Audience!
","Incredibly stylish, wonderfully balanced & thoroughly entertaining, Guy Ritchie's on-screen adaptation of one of literature's greatest creations is a smooth blend of kinetic direction, deft writing & solid performances that may not go down well with the die-hard fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle but it nonetheless succeeds as an impressive cinema of its year that manages to get many things right, if not all.Set in 1891, Sherlock Holmes follows the adventures of its titular character & his colleague, Dr. Watson, as they successfully apprehend the aristocratic serial killer & occult practitioner Lord Blackwood to close their latest case. But when Blackwood's body disappears from his grave, Holmes is hired by a secret society to investigate into the matter, only to discover that his nemesis has been planning a more sinister plot all along.Directed by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock Holmes carries all his trademarks whether it's the hyper- stylised narration, intersecting story lines, exquisite use of wit, frequent jump cuts or active camera-work and is possibly the most visually striking work of his filmmaking career. It also marks the first time that Ritchie didn't write the script for a film he directed but it doesn't make much difference for the plot & characters do carry a certain depth.Production design team does a stellar job in coming up with period set pieces that nicely reflect the timeline this film is set in yet carry a modern feel to it. Cinematography makes fab use of its camera for it employs a number of tricks from slow-mo shots to high-speed photography to capture its drama & action. Editing keeps the narrative tight & gripping for the most part, and Hans Zimmer's score is simply magnificent for it enhances the entire experience by a great extent.Coming to the performances, Sherlock Holmes features an outstanding cast in Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Mark Strong & Rachel McAdams, and their contributions certainly lift the film up. Downey Jr. further solidifies his star status by delivering a charismatic performance in the coveted role of Sherlock Holmes. Law also impresses as Dr. Watson and his chemistry with Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. Strong is dependable as always while McAdams does nicely in her role of Irene Adler; Holmes' former adversary.On an overall scale, Sherlock Holmes may not be the best transition of literature's greatest detective on the film canvas but it nonetheless succeeds as one deliciously humoured & downright fun flick that packs in an action-packed plot, captivating premise & interesting characters and benefits a lot from Ritchie's visual flair, Downey Jr.'s magnetic charm & Hans Zimmer's splendid score. Offering a slightly modified take on the popular figure to make the film more accessible to modern mainstream audience, Sherlock Holmes is one highly amusing & rollicking ride that comes delightfully recommended.",Null,0,2,27 July 2015
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Brutal. Unflinching & Absolutely Devastating. One of the Best Films of Its Genre.
","Brutal, unflinching & absolutely devastating, Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War tells the story of two brothers who are forced to join the army to fight in the front at the outbreak of the Korean War. The film puts up a gruesome display of combat on the screen while also capturing the deterioration of these siblings' relationship as the film progresses which ends with a heartbreaking conclusion.Superbly directed, especially the battle scenes, the film is unforgiving in its depiction of the horrors of war and presents it with supreme quality. The inspiration comes from many war films of the past but it still maintains a uniqueness over its content. The camera-work is very dynamic while editing keeps the drama flowing smoothly. And last but not the least, the soundtrack is surely one of the best you can find in a war film.On an overall scale, Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War is an explosive, potent, powerful & heartfelt tale that keeps the story of these two brothers its first priority throughout its runtime and although the performances from its cast sometimes went overboard & too melodramatic, the film captures their relation so well that their clashes of morals & love for each other feels genuine to a considerable extent. An excellent example of its genre, Tae Guk Gi: Brotherhood of War is thoroughly recommended.",Null,2,2,27 February 2014
The Secret Life of Pets," A Cheerful, Harmless & Family-Friendly Distraction
","From the creators of Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets is another barely serviceable feature film to come out from Illumination Studios' canon following their billion dollar-grossing & insufferably pathetic Minions and although it caters well to the needs of its target audience, it remains a highly generic & downright mediocre adventure comedy.Taking place in a Manhattan apartment building, the story of The Secret Life of Pets follows a terrier whose perfect life is uprooted when his owner brings another dog into the house. Although unable to get along at first, the two are compelled to put their differences aside after discovering a sinister plot put together by a horde of lost or abandoned pets.Directed by Chris Renaud & Yarrow Cheney, the movie opens with a brief segment that showcases what pets do once their owners have left for work and it is genuinely funny. The animation is rich & colourful, characters are brilliantly designed & rendered, and it offers a heathy dose of amusement with its fluffy humour but the laughs are usually present in moments that are trivial to its plot.There are moments that are hilarious as hell while it is barely moving on other occasions. Plenty of characters occupy the screen over the course of its runtime but not a single one of them exhibit an interesting enough arc. The voice actors do well with what they're given, pacing is never an issue, camera-work is finely carried out and it is nicely supported by Alexandre Desplat's gleeful score.On an overall scale, The Secret Life of Pets offers a passable family-friendly entertainment and at times exhibits clever use of wit but there is absolutely nothing about it that makes it stand out from the crowd. A slight improvement over Illuminated Entertainment's billion dollar-grossing, headache inducing Minions, it offers a cheerful, harmless & amusing distraction that's meant to be forgotten the moment it ends.",Null,1,1,6 January 2017
WALL·E," Even For Pixar, This Is A First!
","Even for Pixar, WALL·E is something that this animation studio has accomplished for the very first time & is quite possibly their most perfect film to date. Surpassing Pixar's very own genre-defining standards, pushing the boundaries of animation to an entirely new level & effortlessly transcending the conventions of its genre, WALL·E shows what animation is capable of when used as a medium to narrate a story & is one of the greatest achievements in the history of filmmaking.Set in a distant future, WALL·E paints a very bleak portrait of our planet that has been abandoned by mankind after it became too unfit to sustain human life and chronicles the adventures of a robot that was designed to clean up the whole mess, has been alone on the waste-covered Earth for centuries & has developed sentience. When another robot named EVE arrives to survey the planet, WALL·E falls in love with her at first sight & follows her into outer space on a journey that would change the fate of mankind.Co-written & directed by Andrew Stanton, WALL·E marks another impressive high for the very filmmaker who previously dazzled the world with his breathtaking underwater adventure, Finding Nemo & this time, presents him raising the bar for movies set in outer space. While the fabulously written screenplay touches on current world issues like pollution, mass consumerism, sedentary lifestyle & dependence on technology amongst other things, it's how these themes are presented that makes WALL·E an instant classic.Opening with what isn't entirely an unrealistic view of our planet's future, the first act of WALL·E is also its strongest for the sequences set on Earth are an absolute marvel to look at & even the storyline in this act makes minimal use of dialogues, relying mostly on visuals. Humans do make their appearance from the second act onwards but it's the robots here in whom we invest our emotions with assured confidence, and they don't let us down for their arc is deftly written, carefully handled & confidently presented.From the technical point of view, WALL·E is in a league of its own. Production design team makes expert use of real world entities for its sets, Cinematography is jaw-dropping for it blends live-action with 3D animation unlike anything seen or done before but as far as animation photography goes, it ends up setting new standards with its inventive use of lighting, colour palettes, camera placements & focus shots for this picture is the closest animation has ever come to replicating live-action cinema on the silver screen.The computer animation has always been a state-of-the-art aspect in Pixar's features but in WALL·E, it opens up a wide range of possibilities for its medium unlike ever before & explores the new realms with sublime artistry. Editing exhibits a steady control over its pacing & every frame throughout its 98 minutes of runtime serves a meaningful purpose in the end product. And then there is Thomas Newman's heartwarming score that makes WALL·E a deeply intimate, beautiful, touching, innocent & soul-stirring experience.The two adorable characters we have here in WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth- Class) & EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) are elegantly designed and express emotions so well that we are instantly connected to their thoughts without any requirement of verbal exposition. The entirety of WALL·E's expressions come from those binocular eyes & his rugged design fits the environment he works in while EVE presents a much advanced technology & her precision finish resembles the design aesthetics found exclusively in Apple products.Also, ever since 2001: A Space Odyssey happened, almost every single feature film set in outer space has gone on to pay homage to that quintessential sci-fi classic yet of all the space operas out there, WALL·E is by far the best tribute to Kubrick's magnum opus in my opinion for it treats that masterpiece's legacy with utmost respect but is also able to carve its own identity by retaining its originality. The film also makes reference to the 1969 musical Hello, Dolly! and in many ways, is a wonderful ode to various products by Apple Inc. as well.On an overall scale, WALL·E is an immensely fascinating science-fiction adventure, a whole-heartedly mesmerising love story & a groundbreaking feat of computer animation, all extraordinarily intermixed into one profoundly moving, delightfully entertaining & thoroughly rewarding cinema that effectively addresses the themes of love, loneliness & companionship, and has a lot to say about our degrading environment, inactive lifestyle, consumerism & over-reliance on technology, including where all this could lead us in the near-future unless we decide to act.Whether you place it in the genre(s) of sci-fi, romance, adventure or comedy, WALL·E will manage to come out as a winner in all of them with effortless ease for it is a triumph in every filmmaking department & is a cinematic treasure that'll be cherished for decades to come. Watching it only once isn't enough for the story unravels more of its depths on multiple viewings. One of the best films of its year, one of the finest films of its decade, one of the prime examples of its genre(s) & definitely amongst the greatest films ever made, WALL·E is an unprecedented feat of animation filmmaking that simply works.",Null,0,2,7 October 2013
Finding Dory," Did We Really Need A Sequel To Finding Nemo? No. Am I Glad That It Exists? Yes.
","Finding Nemo was love at first sight. It was a breathtaking, bewitching & beautifully balanced underwater adventure that didn't just dazzle viewers around the globe with its emotionally rich tale about parenting, friendship, trust & determination but also cemented Pixar's position as a pioneer of quality cinema and a powerhouse of originality, creativity, imagination & groundbreaking computer animation. Add to that, it is still counted amongst the greatest achievements of animation filmmaking.In all honesty, I never wanted a sequel to Finding Nemo. That classic is perfect in every way, and I believed its sequel to be an unnecessary risk that would end up denting the legacy of the original. And yet, a part of me is pleased that it exists because Andrew Stanton has crafted this follow-up chapter with same passion, heart & dedication with which he crafted the first one. By all means, Finding Dory is no match to the original but then it also is no cash-grab sequel like Cars 2 was. There's a sense of déjà-vu in this tale but it also brims with just enough freshness to qualify as a welcome successor to a beloved masterpiece.Set one year after the events of the first film, the story of Finding Dory follows Dory, the regal blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss who starts having fragmented dreams & flashbacks of her life before she met Marlin & Nemo, and ultimately decides to find her family. Heading to the place where she vaguely remembers having seen her parents last, Dory is caught by volunteers of a Marine Life Institute and is put into the quarantine section where she meets a seven-legged red octopus named Hank, who agrees to take her to her loved ones in exchange for something. Meanwhile, Marlin & Nemo try to get into the institute in an attempt to rescue Dory.Co-written & directed by Andrew Stanton (best known for Finding Nemo & WALLE), Finding Dory opens with a flashback segment that introduces us to our titular character as an infant, covers her separation from her family, and then follows her journey over the years until she finally meets Marlin for the first time. And this opening sequence wonderfully sets the stage for the rest of the picture as Stanton sensibly addresses the themes of family, separation & identity, returns to Dory's childhood whenever possible, and although it results in some sort of fractured narrative, it also influences the next set of events that unfold afterwards, thus working in favour of the story.The screenplay is brilliantly penned down as well, for it retains the heart, soul & wit of the original, while adding more emotional weight & depth to our forgetful fish. While it is more melancholic than its predecessor, that element isn't overused and the story remains a fun-filled entertainer throughout its runtime. The oceanic life is revisited only briefly since majority of its plot unfolds in a marine institute, and yet the fauna beneath the sea is gorgeously rendered & meticulously detailed. It also adds an ample amount of new characters with Dory promoted to lead role while both Marlin & Nemo settle for a seat behind a couple of fresh arrivals amongst whom Hank leaves a lasting impression.Jaw-dropping 3D animation has always been Pixar's default setting from the start and this aspect remains unchanged with Finding Dory as the animators have done a terrific job once again, whether it's the underwater backgrounds, character designs or overall rendering of even the most minute details. Camera is splendidly utilised, images make use of all the vivid colours available in the palette, while pixel-perfect lighting gives it a more vibrant appearance. Editing skilfully interweaves Dory's past & present into an easily accessible storyline although the trimming of a few slow patches in the middle would have resulted in a more rigid narrative structure as well as improved pacing.As always the case with Pixar films, the voice cast for new characters is wisely chosen while the reprising cast exhibits no trouble in immersing themselves into their given roles. Ellen DeGeneres was easily the standout in Finding Nemo and she is easily the standout in Finding Dory, for her character gets to play with deeper emotions this time without discarding her good-hearted, optimistic & delightfully charming persona. Rest of the supporting characters, both reprising & new play their part convincingly, And last but not the least, Thomas Newman contributes with a calm, touching & emotionally resonant score that stays within the realm of the original.On an overall scale, Finding Dory is undoubtedly an accomplished sequel despite falling short of matching the greatness of its predecessor. Stanton's decision to go for a fresh & organic storyline instead of rehashing the same stuff is commendable and although not every attempt at humour works out in its favour, it remains a joyful ride from start to finish that will amuse both kids & adults alike. Did we really need a sequel to Finding Nemo? No. Is its existence justified? Somewhat. Am I glad that it exists? Yes. It doesn't take away anything from the original but it strengthens Pixar's position by a great deal, while simultaneously conveying to us that it is still capable of churning out sequels that are more than mere cash-grabs. Nostalgic, poignant & hilarious in rhythmic doses, Finding Dory marks yet another win for Pixar Animation Studios on critical, commercial & emotional scale. Highly recommended.",Null,9,23,26 June 2016
Stalag 17," Another One Of Billy Wilder's Unpolished Gem.
","The more I'm watching films directed by Billy Wilder, the more I'm getting convinced that he could very well be the most brilliant & versatile filmmaker of the 20th century for this master writer-director had a remarkable knack for wit which kept almost all his films a light-hearted affair, including those which dealt with serious subject matters, yet effortlessly managed to deliver its message without ever compromising with the entertainment factor.Set during The Second World War in a German POW camp that houses only American sergeants, the story begins with two prisoners from the barrack who after careful planning with the rest of inmates try to escape the camp but are discovered & shot down. The rest of the inmates suspect that one amongst them is an informer but when the suspicion falls on the camp's notorious black marketeer, he decides to find out the real culprit before it's too late for him.Excellently directed by Billy Wilder, Stalag 17 is another one of his unpolished gems which is set during the final years of World War II, in a Nazi prisoner of war camp and yet, despite its grim setting, remains a fun & rollicking experience from start to finish. Cleverly scripted as well, Wilder effortlessly succeeds in balancing all its elements, provides just the perfect dose of every genre this film deals with & employs near-perfect use of humour in its plot.Coming to the technical aspects, the camps depicted in the movie have an authentic feel to some extent, the black n white photography is brilliantly carried out, editing keeps the flow of entertainment smooth & although the use of music is minimal, it's fitting wherever it is present. Every character we interact with exhibit a distinct personality yet it's William Holden who plays an anti-hero here whom we choose to invest our emotions in & are finely rewarded in the end, thanks to his stellar performance.On an overall scale, Stalag 17 is one of the finest World War II prisoner of war films that has something in store for every kind of cinema viewer out there. It's a first rate spy-thriller that offers a first-rate entertainment with its brilliant take on the genres of war, drama, comedy, thriller & mystery and doesn't feel even slightly aged despite being over half century old. People who don't like something funny being made out of what was a horror event may find a lot to criticize but for me, it just works. Highly recommended.",Null,2,4,26 September 2014

The Terminal," A Sweet, Gentle & Touching Tale Of American Dream, Innocence, Compassion & Love.
","Marking the third collaboration between Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks after Saving Private Ryan & Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal is an intimately crafted, light-hearted, feel-good romantic comedy that benefits from Spielberg's assured direction & Hanks' heartwarming performance to make a smooth take off, stable flight & safe landing over the course of its runtime.Inspired from a real-life event, The Terminal tells the story of Viktor Navorski who arrives at JFK airport from a politically unstable country only to find himself trapped at the terminal for his passport is no longer valid & he can't be deported back because of the outbreak of war in his homeland. Stuck at airport for an unspecified time, he ends up making this new place his temporary home.Directed by Steven Spielberg, The Terminal is a surprisingly low-key film from the director who's second to none when it comes to blockbuster filmmaking. Yet what makes this story such a heartfelt fun ride is the amount of charm, affection & love it radiates in every frame. Spielberg's direction is very relaxed, the writing is sensible & the whole production is quite sound on technical level.Production Design team does a spectacular job in replicating the entire airport for its set, Cinematography makes fab use of camera to pull the viewers in, Editing finely paces the whole narrative, John Williams' score is incredibly touching at times, Tom Hanks delivers a performance that's fascinating, funny & delicately balanced and frankly, this film could've done without any love story angle.On an overall scale, The Terminal is a sweet, gentle & genuinely affecting tale of American dream, innocence, compassion & love that's enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying in more ways than one. Sure it isn't without its shortcomings & the second half fails to do justice to the film's first hour, the magic spell cast by Spielberg & Hanks together ultimately manages to brush away most complaints. Delightfully recommended.",Null,0,1,10 October 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.
","Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of 'Red' in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended.",Null,3,4,25 July 2010

Rango," How High Can You Aim When Your Whole Purpose In Life Is To Blend In?
","Industrial Light & Magic's first foray into the world of animation hits all the right notes for Rango is an endlessly fascinating recreation of the Wild West that brims with cutting-edge animation and is just as accomplished in its technical aspects as it is structurally sound in its narration. Jam-packed with clever references to classic spaghetti westerns yet retaining an originality of its own, the first feature-length animation film from the pioneering VFX firm is one of the best westerns to surface in recent years.Set in an Old West town populated by desert fauna, Rango tells the story of its titular character, an ordinary chameleon who winds up in the desert town following an unforeseen accident and in order to blend in, presents himself as a tough drifter. As the lawless outpost is in desperate need of both water & a hero, the thirsty chameleon takes up the role of sheriff in order to solidify his own image amongst the residents and selfishly leads an investigation into the town's missing water case that ultimately makes him confront his own demons.Directed by Gore Verbinski (best-known for Pirates of the Caribbean), Rango marks his first stint with the medium of animation and he does an excellent job at it for the story is deftly scripted, the plot is character-driven, there's a precision balance between its moments of action, comedy & drama, and just like the best spaghetti westerns, it is never in hurry to bring its tale to completion. The characters themselves exhibit interesting arcs & their roles are concisely defined plus the very themes of identity, heroism & adaptation are skilfully addressed.Industrial Light & Magic is best known for its groundbreaking visual effects in live-action films and yet the top-grade computer animation they put up here shows that they are capable of competing with both Pixar & DreamWorks if it ever comes to that. Every rendered frame stays within the realm of its genre. The barren desert landscapes, rugged characters, no law or order & other little details only enhance the look n feel of its story. And also admirable is its good dose of exciting gunslinging action & occasional staging of duels that add to the overall experience.From the technical standpoint, Rango gets nearly everything right. The set pieces are reminiscent of lawless outposts with little to no civilisation. The camera showcases a frenetic energy whenever it is required, the warm colour tones, improved contrast & apt lighting further enhance its imagery while the movements are fluid & expertly handled given the scene & its requirements. Editing trims out what the story can do without but there are still a few slow patches in the final print. And Hans Zimmer's inspired, energetic & exhilarating soundtrack uplifts the story by a further few notches.The contribution from the actors who give these animated characters their voices n more is often taken for granted but its importance is realised in this picture. Featuring an impeccable voice cast spearheaded by Johnny Depp himself, every actor does justice to their respective characters with Depp & Bill Nighy impressing the most. Depp has given us some truly eccentric characters in the past, many of whom turned out to be bigger than the films they appeared in, and Rango is certainly no exception for Depp's colourful voice input plays a vital role in making the chameleon stand out.On an overall scale, Rango is an ingeniously crafted, endlessly witty & beautifully animated western comedy that's refreshing, enjoyable & entertaining from start to finish, and for an animated feature, it is a surprisingly mature entry that's more aimed at well-versed cinephiles but it nonetheless promises plenty of fun & laughter to those who might be oblivious of its countless references & homages to past classics. Cleverly directed by Verbinski, bolstered by Depp's sensational vocal performance & meticulously brought to life by ILM, Rango isn't just one of the best films of its year but is great enough to rank amongst the finest examples of western filmmaking. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,9 April 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Technical Marvel That's Ambitious, Audacious & Astonishing.
","From the director of Amores Perros, 21 Grams & Babel, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu's most distinct & daring film to date when compared to his previous works, and certainly the most ambitious one around on a technical scale as the renowned filmmaker here aims to blur the lines between theater & film as well as reality & fiction without breaking continuity and for the most part, he truly succeeds.Birdman tells the story of a former Hollywood star famous for playing an iconic superhero decades ago & who is now a washed up actor. Filled with regret, constantly tormented by the voice of his most memorable character & fearing of falling into oblivion, he decides to make a comeback by risking everything he has on a Broadway play, hoping that its success will revitalize his career. But as the play approaches its premiere, he runs into several issues.Co-written, produced & directed by Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu, Birdman is a huge leap for the Mexican filmmaker as he completely reinvents his tone, style & method without discarding the themes that have been an integral part of his entire filmography. Screenplay takes a jab at all things Hollywood & doesn't even spare the critics but it is actually in the fluid execution of these moments where Birdman ends up making its biggest impression.Emmanuel Lubezki is steadily rising as one of the best camera operators around & with Birdman, he adds another impressive feat to his résumé. Apart from its opening & closing moments, the entire picture is presented as one continuous long take for the camera keeps floating from one character to another, even manages to shift through time & different sets without breaking continuity, and works in perfect tandem with editing & digital effects to pull off its gimmick.Coming to the performances, Michael Keaton makes a stunning return to form with a work that's arguably his career-best. But he isn't alone as Edward Norton also chips in a performance we haven't seen from the actor in a long time. And the supporting cast is no slouch either for Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan & Lindsay Duncan do a fine job in their given roles, but Birdman is ultimately Keaton's show all the way from start to finish.On an overall scale, Iñárritu's first foray into the comedy genre has more positives than negatives for his latest is a technical marvel that's ambitious, audacious & astonishing, and yet I can't help but feel slightly underwhelmed by it because it could've done so much more with its self- referential characters, the theater vs film & art vs commerce argument, and its bashing of critics but it unfortunately doesn't. In the end, the most memorable thing about this film isn't its story or characters but its one-shot gimmick. Nevertheless, Birdman comes recommended.",Null,1,10,4 February 2015
The Big Short," Insightful, Informative & Entertaining But Also Difficult To Follow At Times!
","Boasting a star cast of Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt & others, all put together in an interesting story about the financial crisis of 2007-2010 that nearly crippled the world economy, plus regularly allowing its characters to break the fourth wall in order to explain the complexities of financial market to the audience, The Big Short is insightful but also messy at times.Based on the book of the same name, the film intercuts multiple story lines and concerns the people who predicted the credit & housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s but, after witnessing the corruption within banks plus its lack of foresight, decided to bet against the market and profited enormously when it all went down while majority of population lost its lifetime's worth of savings.Co-written & directed by Adam McKay, The Big Short features a highly fascinating subject matter for there are still many around who were affected by the crisis that triggered the great recession yet aren't entirely aware of what exactly caused it & how. While McKay keeps his characters ready to simplify the complex terms of economy, the characters inhabiting this story themselves lack an interesting dimension.The script attempts to juggle multiple subplots but hits a few barricades in the process for it lacks a smooth flow due to muddled editing. Camera-work is a bit chaotic and although the pace at which it all unfolds is consistent, the transition from one subplot to another isn't. As far as performances go, only Carell leaves a lasting impression while Bale, Gosling & Pitt are unexpectedly underwhelming in their given roles and just play along.On an overall scale, The Big Short is an in-depth examination of the global financial crisis which is driven by McKay's kinetic direction, deftly written screenplay & fancy performances from its entire cast. Informative, investigative & entertaining yet requiring some effort from its viewers who need to keep up with its swiftly-paced, dialogue-driven narrative, the film tries to bring its complex tale to a more accessible level yet required a bit more transparency.

Platoon," A Genre Masterpiece That Works Even Better As A Meditation On Morality
","Painting a very grim but also realistic portrait of the horrors of war and also illustrating how it affects the psyche & moral ethics of even the bravest, Platoon is a terrific blend of expert direction, compact screenplay & engaging performances that is counted amongst the finest examples of warfare filmmaking and deservingly so.Set during the Vietnam War, the story of Platoon follows a young American who drops out of college, enlists in the US army & volunteers for combat duty in Vietnam. Upon arrival, he finds himself caught in between two non-commissioned officers who are constantly at odds with each other, and has to battle with not just the enemy but also men within his own platoon.Written & directed by Oliver Stone, Platoon presents the director brilliantly penning down his personal experience of Vietnam on the paper before bringing it to life in the form of moving images. Stone's direction is truly commendable for he knows what he wants this film to be and what it needs to reflect about war & the deep scars it leaves on anyone who ever was a part of it.Vietnam is brought to life in detail thanks to its clever set pieces & well-chosen shooting locations. Cinematography keeps a safe distance from all the unfolding drama yet every captured moment has a story to tell. Editing is nicely carried out for the most part & provides a good pace to the narrative. And as for the music, 'Adagio of Strings' by Samuel Barber is a perfect companion piece to go with this war drama.Coming to the acting department, Platoon features a splendid cast in Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe & Tom Berenger and all three of them shine in their given roles. Sheen plays the naive kid who volunteers for war in Vietnam where he undergoes a psychological meltdown of his own and his performance is compelling. Also adding more strength to the acting aspect are stellar inputs from both Berenger & Dafoe, with the latter being the most impressive of them all.On an overall scale, Platoon is Oliver Stone's plea for humanity in the face of something as harrowing & psychologically damaging as war and is a heartbreaking illustration of the loss of innocence, morals & ethics that also says much about the duality of man. It's technically accomplished yet its real strength lies in the its script, direction & admirable performances from its cast. A memorable war drama that works even better as a powerful meditation on morality, Platoon comes highly recommended.",Null,1,1,14 October 2013

Prometheus," I Was Wrong... It Was So Wrong...
","I was wrong... It was so wrong... to think that Prometheus might be a hidden gem that will reveal more of its treasure on repeated viewings. Because watching it again only refreshed my memory of what disappointed me two years back. Is it really a prequel to Alien or is it a standalone feature that shares only strands of DNA with that horror masterpiece? As it turns out, there is still no definite answer to this question.Set in the late 21st century & taking place in the same universe as other films of Alien franchise, Prometheus concerns a team of explorers who discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth in the form of a star map & embark on a journey to meet their makers. But what they actually end up discovering is a threat that could lead to the annihilation of entire human race on planet Earth.The movie opens with some breathtaking shots of landscapes that you generally expect in a Terrence Malick film & from then on it's a journey downwards as it neither scares nor thrills. Directed by Ridley Scott, it's heartbreaking to find him ruining the very universe which guaranteed him a spot in film history and although he plays with many themes in the story, not one of them is executed properly.The screenplay is an utter nonsense as the plot is full of loopholes and even though it raises some pretty good questions through its thematic elements, it never answers any of it & provides an excuse of an unnecessary sequel as a cover up for its lazy script. Cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, Editing could've chopped so much here, music hardly contributed anything. but Visual effects is pretty impressive & wonderfully detailed.Coming to the acting department, the entire cast of Prometheus delivers a forgettable performance with only Fassbender & Rapace managing to impress in bits n pieces. Other than a handful of characters who didn't do much anyway, the rest are present as death fodders only & there isn't one moment that made me care about any of these dull people's lives. Even the creatures aren't scary or intriguing by any means, damn it.On an overall scale, Prometheus isn't just a disappointing feature but is badly filmed too as almost nothing works in its favour & this wasn't expected from the director who defined this very genre with his 1979 masterpiece. The only consolation comes from its visuals but that's also useless when you don't have an engaging story to back it up. Ridley Scott's movies either work big or fail big. And Prometheus, unfortunately, belongs to the latter.",Null,11,19,15 June 2012
Halloween," The Most Influential Of All Slasher Films!
","Possibly the most influential of all slasher films, John Carpenter's Halloween is the reason why this particular subgenre of horror even exists in the first place. Although it wasn't the first of its kind, it certainly was the game-changer for almost every other slasher flick that followed this low-budget indie horror only ended up imitating the formula that this classic originated.Set in Haddonfield, Illinois, the story of Halloween begins on the titular night in 1963 where we witness the 6-years old Michael Myers stabbing his older sister to death with a kitchen knife. The plot then jumps 15 years in the span of which Myers remained silent in a mental hospital he was confined to, only to escape from the facility and returns to his hometown to kill some more.Co-written & directed by John Carpenter, whose innate ability to churn out quality pictures from mere scraps of filmmaking elements has earned him a place amongst world cinema's most influential filmmakers, Halloween is one of the finest works of his career that presents the director in complete control of his craft, and the way he sets the pace & eerie tone from the beginning is a delight to watch.Carpenter creates an uncanny mood during the title sequence only which has nothing but a jack-o-lantern on the black screen, accompanied by the now iconic score, and follows it up with an expertly shot prologue which instantly brings the audience into the story. The script is equally impressive for the character of Michael Myers is handled with extreme care, and the writers leave no stone unturned to show him as an unstoppable force of evil.The technical aspects are skilfully executed, and every dollar of its low budget is efficiently used in service of the story. Setting the plot in a suburban location turns the very openness of the area into a playground of mayhem. Cinematography is inventive for the camera stalks our characters at all times, benefits from some ingenious placements, and is further uplifted by clever lighting while Editing makes sure that the suspenseful ambiance is kept alive from start to finish.But the biggest contributor, in my opinion, is John Carpenter's minimal, synthesised score for it elevates the tension to a whole different level and greatly amplifies the desired effect of its disquieting camera-work & editing. Whenever its main theme surfaces on the screen, there's an uneasiness felt in those moments & whispers of an ominous presence dominate those sequences. It's one of Carpenter's most notable musical pieces & is a major reason behind this film's success.Coming to the acting department, Halloween features a budget-friendly cast in Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, P.J. Soles, Nancy Loomis & Nick Castle. The film marks Curtis' acting debut and she does a neat job as Laurie; a high-school student who's continuously stalked by Myers throughout the movie. Pleasence is in as Myers' psychiatrist and the only person who knows what this homicidal maniac is capable of. And Soles & Loomis do a fine job as Laurie's friends who are also pursued by Myers.But it's the character of Michael Myers and how he's portrayed in this film that establishes him as one of the greatest antagonists in cinema history. Using nothing but a cheap mask that conveys no emotions, keeping him mute throughout the story & giving him an almost mythic strength that renders him invincible, Carpenter presents Myers as a devil incarnate who kills without empathy, and intelligently uses his presence in the film to build a sinister aura, not to mention the very aspects of this character has gone on to inspire many more villains.On an overall scale, Halloween remains one of the genre-defining films of the 1970s whose narrative structure has been adopted as a blueprint for slasher films ever since and its vast influence on cinema & pop culture cannot be downplayed. There were a couple of moments that bothered me but for the most part, this is a thrilling, entertaining & satisfying ride from Carpenter that is every bit worthy of its legendary status. A lesson in horror filmmaking that downplays the elements of gore & graphic violence to show the lasting effect a consistently maintained tense ambiance can have on the viewers, Halloween is the very definition of a slasher film.",Null,13,16,31 October 2015

Paths of Glory," Anti-War Films Don't Get Any Better Than This
","Making a profound statement against war, crafted with precision care & sincerity, and featuring some truly memorable & exquisitely detailed shots throughout its runtime, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory is one of the finest examples of its genre which established the then-young filmmaker as one of the most promising directors of its time & continues to influence warfare filmmaking, even today.Based on Humphrey Cobb's novel of the same name, the story of Paths of Glory is set in France during the First World War and concerns Colonel Dax; a commanding officer of French soldiers, who goes against the orders of his superiors & refuses to continue marching his troops towards what's clearly a suicide mission, only to later defend them when they're charged with cowardice in a court-martial.Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the entire picture is steadily narrated, properly introduces its fascinating characters & presents a remarkable level of craftsmanship in its technical aspects. Set pieces are state-of-the-art stuff, Cinematography is notable for its fluid tracking shots, the brutality of war is unflinchingly portrayed, Editing is steadily carried out & its score provides a militarised feel to the whole narrative.Coming to the acting department, Paths of Glory features a fine cast in Kirk Douglas, George Macready & others, and the performances are very impressive. Leading from the front is Douglas as Colonel Dax; the commander who stops the attack midway after the first wave are mercilessly slaughtered. Macready plays General Mireau, who in pursuit of more power green lights the attack despite being aware of the impossibility of the mission & the supporting cast chips in strongly too.On an overall scale, anti-war films don't get any better than this for Paths of Glory presents Stanley Kubrick in prime form & is a timeless classic that hasn't lost even an ounce of its effectiveness despite being nearly 60 years old. Brilliantly directed, deftly scripted, boldly shot, splendidly photographed, tightly edited & nicely scored, Paths of Glory is an amazing portrait of greed, fear, death, war & duty that comes one hundred percent recommended.",Null,0,1,10 January 2015

","Illumination Entertainment's feature film debut is an incessantly sweet, delightfully charming & wonderfully animated treat that brims with lots of energy, heart & creativity, and also finds an exquisite balance between its storytelling aspects & outrageous moments of comedy to succeed as one fine family-friendly entertainer for viewers of all ages.The story of Despicable Me follows Gru; a supervillain whose pride his hurt when the Great Pyramid of Giza is stolen by an unknown villain, following which he reveals his master plan that will put other villains to shame. He also adopts three orphan girls as pawns for his grand scheme but soon find out that their love is changing him into a different person.Co-directed by Pierre Coffin & Chris Renaud, Despicable Me packs in a lot of freshness in its story, humour & characters and even if the screenplay borrows many different elements from other examples of its medium, the film manages to carve an originality of its own. The camera-work is 3D oriented, editing unfolds the plot briskly & background score is pleasant as well.Coming to the characters, they're cleverly imagined, designed & rendered and also benefit a lot from its brilliantly chosen voice-cast, especially Steve Carell who voices Gru. Even the developing relationship between Gru & his trio of girls has a genuine feel to it. But it's the Minions who end up stealing the show for almost every scene featuring them is hilarious as hell.On an overall scale, Despicable Me is a light-hearted, fun-filled & joyous work of animation that promises an amusing, heartwarming & satisfying experience and effortlessly delivers it.

Back to the Future Part II," Saved Entirely By Its Sturdy Third Act
","Quite a drop in quality if not so much in entertainment value, Back to the Future II picks up right where its predecessor signed off and continues the adventures of Marty & Doc as they journey into the future & past in this goofy, amusing & over-the-top sequel that surely lacks the freshness of the original yet delivers a bumpy but fun ride.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film's vision of the future is far more cartoonish than expected, and the poorly dated effects, corny treatment & exaggerated acts don't help either. It's only when they make their way back into the past again that things begins to improve and the film starts regaining its lost touch. The third act is its saving grace.The futuristic set pieces don't exude the same level of excitement that sci-fi relics of the first film did, and the dystopian present they return to is an overkill as well. The premise is nonetheless interesting, expertly structured and the way it merges with previous chapter's events is riveting to watch. Performances are a step down this time around but still serviceable.Overall, Back to the Future II has its share of negatives and exhibits shortcomings of its own making but it still offers a blockbuster extravaganza that many viewers won't complain about. While much more ambitious than the first film, this follow-up chapter fails to execute it all with same finesse as before, and is an inferior end product that finds its sure footing only in the final act.",Null,0,1,1 April 2020
Carrie," Dated, But Still Good.
","The very horror classic that has haunted prom nights ever since it was introduced to the filmgoing audience back in 1976, Brian De Palma's Carrie is one of the first adaptations of a Stephen King novel on the film canvas and even though it looks quite dated today, it's still does a much better job in storytelling elements than the horror flicks of today.The film tells the story of Carrie White; a shy & peerless 17-year old girl who possesses a rare gift of telekinesis and has faced nothing but constant abuse at the hands of her fanatically religious mother. The main plot of the film concerns a humiliating prank Carrie's classmates play on her which ultimately ends with very drastic consequences.Brilliantly directed, wonderfully adapted for the screen, nicely photographed, fairly edited, finely scored & benefiting greatly from Sissy Spacek's impressive performance as Carrie, there isn't much wrong with the film yet whatever it puts on screen doesn't hold up so well after all these years & Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother didn't help either for it was too hammy a performance to be appreciated.On an overall scale, Carrie is an interesting look at supernatural powers, high school bullying & the often frustrating phase every teenager generally goes through, and is one amongst the many unforgettable chillers to come out from Hollywood during the 1970s. Time hasn't been very kind to this motion picture but it still possesses a mysterious strength that can spellbind many newcomers.",Null,1,2,27 October 2013
Marriage Story," A Love Story Told Through The Lens Of A Divorce
","From the director of The Squid & the Whale, Frances Ha & Mistress America comes a love story told through the lens of a divorce. Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach taking inspirations from his own life and pouring details of the separation process he himself went through into the script, and the result is a very personal, evocative tale.The film captures the awful, ugly, messy & emotionally devastating side of marriage dissolution with utmost sincerity. Baumbach's script is as impressive as his direction and his own personal connection to the material allows him to be aware of where to draw the line and not get carried away, thus keeping things grounded & authentic at all times.Helping the writer-director translate his story from script to screen are Adam Driver & Scarlett Johansson, both bringing their fragmented characters to life with fervour in what's arguably the finest performances in the careers of both. Packing a strong emotional wallop, their renditions unfold like emotions steadily rising to the surface until it finally explodes.Laura Dern also manages to stand out with a smashing input, and steals almost all her scenes while that annoying kid gives the audience a reason why they shouldn't have one in the first place. The plot structure & execution resembles a theatre play, camerawork is fluid, employing long takes & close-ups in ways that only pulls us in. And thanks to smooth editing, the narrative flow remains streamlined.On an overall scale, Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach delivering on every front, and ranks amongst his best directorial efforts. What strikes out most about his latest work is that he captures the mundanity with same zeal as the story's vital segments, and addresses the themes of loneliness, heartbreak, agony, frustration & regret with an understanding, compassionate eye.

Raging Bull," Impressive From A Filmmaking Standpoint But Lacking Flavour In Narration
","Bringing the life story of one of the roughest brawlers to ever step into the boxing ring, Raging Bull finds director Martin Scorsese & actor Robert De Niro teaming up once again to deliver yet another quality work but just like their other collaborations, it left me cold & indifferent to whatever it had in store and while I respect the legacy of this sports drama, I'm no fan of it.Raging Bull chronicles the life of Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxer whose rage, jealously & bouts of violent outbursts helps propel him to the top of the division but his inability to keep those vicious tendencies in check outside the arena leads him on a path of self-destruction, as he destroys his relationships with his wife & family over the years and wounds up all alone in his later life.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film is incredibly faithful to its source material and recreates the events with accuracy. Shot in black & white, which gives the picture a timeless quality, it illustrates the good, bad & ugly side of LaMotta with finesse and his arc is undeniably compelling. But he also comes off as an insufferable persona whose problems are of his own making which makes his downward journey all the more deserving.What also affects the experience is that the story remains a monotonous ride for the entirety of its runtime. There is no escalation whatsoever whether we are witnessing LaMotta's boxing bouts or personal life. It's just a similar set of events repeated time n again for 125 minutes and that's not enough to keep the interest alive. It's brutal & violent in the ring but it fails to deliver the desired emotional impact because we are just not invested in his journey.However, from a filmmaking standpoint, Raging Bull is an outstanding piece of work. The staging of events, the era-appropriate set pieces, the boxing choreography, the controlled camerawork, all of it exhibit an exactness that's quite commendable. And as for the performances, Robert De Niro leads the show from the front and delivers a smashing showcase as Jake LaMotta, and he is brilliantly supported by Joe Pesci & Cathy Moriarty who play his brother & wife respectively.On an overall scale, Raging Bull is impressive in its craftsmanship but the narration is lacking in flavour and becomes repetitive after a while. Scorsese's direction & De Niro's commitment to his role certainly stand out but the longer it goes on, the more wearisome it becomes. Painting a faithful portrait of a character with no redeeming characteristics, Raging Bull is significant from a filmmaking viewpoint but there isn't much to gain by investing in someone who refuses to learn from his own mistakes.",Null,16,20,29 September 2018
The Iron Giant," Brad Bird's Directional Debut Is A Timeless Classic

Animation that not only triumphs as a technical marvel of its genre but is also the most heartwarming, emotionally resonant & thoroughly intimate narrative to surface on the silver screen since Pixar's very own Toy Story.Set in the late 1950s during the Cold War, The Iron Giant tells the story of Hogarth Hughes; a lonely but smart kid raised by his mother who one day comes across a giant metal robot that fell from space & soon befriends the innocent alien. And with the help of a junkyard owner, he tries to save the fifty-foot, metal-eating robot from the paranoid government that intends to find & destroy the Giant.Directed by Brad Bird, The Iron Giant marks his feature film debut & is a work of impeccable craftsmanship from start to finish. There is no irrelevant moment in its story, every sequence has a role to play, the various themes it deals with brilliantly captures the fear & paranoia present in the society in those times, and the way it all adds up into an engaging & thought- provoking cinema speaks volumes about Bird's talents as a filmmaker.The whole plot maintains a playful tone despite dealing with some serious issues, has a very fluid feel to it coz of which the events unfold in a smooth manner, the 2D animation is exquisitely handled & meticulously detailed plus the CGI element is seamlessly integrated into it, voice cast is wisely chosen, use of colours isn't extensive but it works in its favour, pacing is steady and the background score provides a very personal feel to the story.On an overall scale, The Iron Giant is one of the greatest animation features of last century that deserves to be seen by every cinema lover out there.

Straight Outta Compton," Damn, That Sh*t Was Dope!
","A vicious blend of kinetic direction, smart writing, compelling performances, energetic camera-work & groovy soundtrack, Straight Outta Compton is one of the finest biopics to surface on screen this year that's captivating from its opening moments, is sprinkled with clever wit & offers an intriguing sketch of one of the most influential groups in hip-hop music history, and is amongst the most hip & entertaining movies of 2015.Straight Outta Compton chronicles the rise & fall of the hip-hop group N.W.A which emerged from the violent streets of Compton, California in Los Angeles during the mid-1980s and ultimately went on to bring gangsta rap subgenre into mainstream music. The plot focuses on three of its founding members namely Eazy-E, Ice Cube & Dr. Dre, the numerous controversies the explicit lyrics of their songs invited, and its decline due to financial disputes within the gang.Directed by F. Gary Gray, this biographical drama features a deftly structured story that's smoothly narrated & swiftly paced and is totally devoid of any dull moments. Driven by its electrifying tracks, the whole ambiance of the picture is highly charged & aggressive in tone and manages to make its voice heard loud & clear without going in your face. The gang's critical stance against the police is relevant even today and the reflection of the volatile society it emerged from is evident in their songs but there's more to this flick.Straight Outta Compton does succeed in offering an in-depth glimpse into what N.W.A was trying to express with their explicit, provocative music but it also doesn't shy away from illustrating the flaws of its own members, albeit not as extensively. The background research is carried out in exhaustive detail but a few artistic license is taken here or there to enhance its drama which do work out in its favour in the end. Another positive sign about its quality is that its story is told in such an engaging manner that its 147 minutes of runtime simply flies by.Cinematography exhibits dynamic use of camera that remains in sync with what's unfolding on the screen for it is chaotic when things are on the verge of explosion & easygoing when dealing with calm moments. Every scene accompanied by N.W.A songs is better than the ones without it and the tracks are arranged in a fitting order plus greatly assist in enhancing the whole experience & keeping its potent vibe alive. Editing keeps the plot closely-knitted for the most part & paces it amazingly well but it does slow down near the end where it appears as if having spent all its energy.Coming to the performances, Straight Outta Compton features a relatively fresh ensemble in Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jason Mitchell & Paul Giammati, with all of them chipping in with very convincing work in their given roles. Whether it's the chemistry these guys have with each other or the sequences that require them to prove their mettle individually, Hawkins, Jackson & Mitchell are able to keep the audience's gaze firmly fixed on them and render their real-life figures with sublime effectiveness while Giammati provides reliable support as Jerry Heller, the manager of N.W.A.On an overall scale, Straight Outta Compton is a delightful surprise for it's far better than expected and is told with such passion, confidence & panache that it's difficult to not be swept by its strong tide. The script is an absolute gem for it brims with elements that scream N.W.A from first frame to the last, wisely handles the positive & negative escapades of the group, and puts just about enough meat on its characters' arcs. Highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly rewarding, Straight Outta Compton is an instant classic that's destined to garner a cult following and will stay around for years to come. To summarise it all in a sentence, 'Damn, that sh*t was dope.'",Null,2,26,30 January 2016
Mary and Max," Not As Great As Expected!
","Mary and Max had been a part of my movie collection from the very beginning, having landed in the list because I was following the IMDb Top 250 back then. Anyway, it's the very first time I've seen this film & a part of me keeps wondering why I didn't check it out earlier for I could have gotten rid of it sooner & would've retrieved some storage space on my disk.The story of Mary and Max follows the two titular characters: one is an 8-year-old girl living a lonely life in Australia, other is a morbidly obese 44-year-old man living in America who struggles to form close bonds with people & has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The plot covers the unlikely friendship between these two pen-pals who understand each other better than anyone else.Written & directed by Adam Elliot, everything about Mary and Max is unconventional, from the way its story is narrated to the manner its themes are addressed. Even its animation is neither hand-drawn paintings nor computer renderings but makes use of clay, or claymation as it's called. And while a lot of it is worthy of commendation, it's not a film that's everyone is going to enjoy or appreciate.The entire story is told in voice-overs since we barely see these characters communicating with anyone verbally. The script is brilliantly written plus the themes of loneliness, anxiety, depression, isolation, friendship, Asperger syndrome & obesity are beautifully depicted. The stop-motion photography makes use of separate tints for separate place, sepia for Australia & grayscale for America and the level of detail is impressive.What I also liked is how wonderfully it captures the entire hypocrisy of the society we live in & it's extremely evident when seen from Max's perspective. Editing deliberately keeps a dull pace to reflects their lives but after a point, it becomes unbearable. And music manages to soar in few scenes. Also, the voice cast is wisely chosen & all of them end up doing a good job in infusing more personality into their respective characters.On an overall scale, Mary and Max is an art-house feature from Australian cinema that has a lot many great things going on and while the tone may seem depressing, it offers plenty of laughs along the way, doesn't matter if the humour is deadpan. The best thing about it is the two characters we have in Mary & Max plus the relaxed manner in which their friendship is progressed over the course of its runtime. Definitely worth a shot.",Null,1,3,22 April 2015
Shrek," A Clever, Creative & Comical Delight For Viewers Of All Ages
","Establishing DreamWorks Animation as the first real competitor to Pixar Animation Studios, Shrek is a clever, creative & comical delight that finds its creators firing on all cylinders and is a wonderfully animated & endlessly entertaining tale that works for viewers of all ages.The story follows an ogre whose peaceful life in the swamp is disrupted when many magical creatures show up at his place. To drive them out, he strikes a deal with an evil lord for whom he must rescue a princess & bring her to him in exchange for his land, and is joined by a talking donkey on his quest.Directed by Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson, Shrek comes jam-packed with gags & parodies, all incorporated into a storyline that's simple in structure, easy to follow, and features elements that are more targeted at grown-ups, thus succeeding as an adventure that has something in store for all demographics.All the set pieces & characters are cleverly imagined, expertly designed & skilfully rendered. The relevant characters exhibit sufficient depth and are easy to relate to. Voice actors bring their A-game to infuse life & soul into these animated caricatures, with Eddie Murphy effortlessly winning hearts & stealing the show as Donkey.On an overall scale, Shrek is an end-product of clever imagination, intelligent writing & top-notch animation and though the latter aspect appears slightly dated today, the story hasn't lost much of its magical charm & hilarious wit. Taking a dig at Disney & proving its animation studio to be a worthy challenger to Pixar, Shrek is still one of DreamWorks Animation's finest films to date.",Null,1,1,27 March 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," The Quintessential Suspense Horror!
","One of the most intense, bone-chilling & edge-of-the-seat experiences I've ever had at movies, The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece of suspense, sustained thrills & nail- biting terror that blends the elements of horror, crime & psychology into one tightly packed & smoothly narrated story, features precision level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and benefits immensely from exceptional performances turned in by its cast.Based on the novel of the same name, The Silence of the Lambs follows young FBI cadet Clarice Starling who's pulled out from her training and is assigned a new task that requires her to interview the notorious psychiatrist & cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter for his inputs can provide possible clues that may help them apprehend another serial killer known as 'Buffalo Bill' who likes to skin his victims. Things get interesting when Lecter takes an interest in Starling's life.Directed by Jonathan Demme, this psychological horror introduces its chilling sense of dread right from the moment Howard Shore's score hits the screen, and it only gets more unsettling from there on. Demme's direction is top-notch for he really understands what this film is supposed to be, and leaves no stone unturned to make it as gripping as possible. Of all the films he's made in his filmmaking career, The Silence of the Lambs remains his finest effort to date and is one cinema he will be remembered for.Ted Tally's screenplay also deserves a mention for the script packs in a tightly structured plot, fleshes out its characters amazingly well and never for once deviates from the main storyline. All the themes are smartly addressed, every character has a well-defined arc, the attention to detail is very impressive, each storytelling element is nailed to perfection and there's just nothing to complain about. Even the technical aspects are executed in a manner that's always in the service of its story & characters.The sets pieces are wonderfully detailed & well-lit. The camera makes heavy use of close- ups which brings a creepiness of its own while the balanced colour tones & minimal lighting further enhances its dark ambiance. Each sequence is relevant to the story, the whole film is methodically paced and each scene sets up the next one in queue. Last but not the least, the background score by Howard Shore consists of tracks that encapsulate the whole story with a tense, foreboding atmosphere which further amplifies the entire experience by a considerable extent.Coming to the performances, The Silence of the Lambs features a terrific ensemble in Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn & Ted Levine. While Foster delivers her finest work as Clarice Starling, Hopkins' rendition of the brilliant psychiatrist & cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is beyond excellence and his spot-on chemistry with Foster turns every single conversation between Lecter & Starling into an instant classic moment. Glenn does well as Jack Crawford and Levine is just as good as Foster or Hopkins even if it often gets overshadowed by their inputs.On an overall scale, The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a timeless masterwork of smart direction, taut screenplay, splendid camera-work, tight editing, ominous score & stellar performances that exemplifies just how great a movie can become when all the right ingredients come together & work in harmony to form a complete whole. Absolutely deserving of all its accolades, immortal for its contribution to cinema as well as pop culture, and notorious for bringing on screen arguably the most cunning, charming & feared psychopath, this quintessential suspense horror comes very highly recommended.",Null,1,2,4 October 2015
X-Men: First Class," A Prequel. A Reboot. An Origin Story. No Matter How You See It, X-Men: First Class Just Works.
","Narrating the origin story of the many significant characters in X-Men universe & set in the 1960s during the Cuban missile crisis which put the entire world on the verge of a nuclear Armageddon, X-Men: First Class mainly concerns the close friendship between Charles Xavier & Eric Lensherr before they turned into archenemies and adopted the names of Professor X & Magneto, respectively.Director Matthew Vaughn brings an entirely fresh approach & style in almost all filmmaking departments here and succeeds in balancing its quality action with impressive storytelling without ever letting down the entertainment factor. Tightly edited from start to finish, the film looks absolutely fantastic, thanks to its vibrant cinematography & state-of-the-art visual effects & sensational music.Coming to the performances, the entire cast is pretty well-rounded & each member is very convincing in their given roles. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier aka Professor X while Michael Fassbender is in as Eric Lensherr aka Magneto, and the performance as well as chemistry between these two men is what makes this film work so well along with fine support from the rest of its cast.On an overall scale, benefiting greatly from its brilliant direction, strong script, magnetic performances from McAvoy & Fassbender, terrific visual effects, tight editing & a wonderful score, X-Men: First Class comes out as a highly potent package that guarantees a cinematic experience which is surely going to entertain & astonish its viewers in more ways than one.

The Croods," Incredibly Funny. Immensely Joyful. Deliciously Entertaining.
","An incredibly funny, highly enjoyable, delightfully entertaining & largely satisfying adventure from the talents working at DreamWorks Animation, The Croods is a fun ride for viewers of all ages and while it isn't without its shortcomings, especially in the storytelling department, it's got enough juice in it to be equally hilarious & rewarding for both kids & adults alike.Set in the prehistoric era, The Croods tells the story of a caveman & his family who have survived the wilderness for years by living together in one place instead of exploring the world around; something which their eldest daughter wants to do. Events are set in motion when their cave is destroyed, following which they embark on a journey to find a new home & are joined by an inventive homo sapien.Written, produced & directed by Kirk DeMicco & Chris Sanders, The Croods has a splash of everything to succeed as another fine adventure in the famous animation studios' repertoire but when it comes to human drama, it barely scratches the surface of that element. The film does try to take itself a bit seriously near the end but the effect of it isn't much compared to whatever unfolds on the screen before it.Still, not everything is flawed in this prehistoric setting for those who are looking forward to a fun-filled extravaganza will have a great time with it. Reason for that being the eccentric characters inhabiting the picture, expertly used slapstick humour, a few moments that have a surprising depth to it, its gorgeously rendered animation, fast-paced storyline & the very familial themes which are wonderfully presented.On an overall scale, while The Croods may not be amongst the best films that DreamWorks Animation has offered us to date, it still makes up for a pretty good light-hearted cinema & is best enjoyed when viewed with whole family. Although the humour does feel a bit forced at times & the characters aren't that well carved out, The Croods still delivers on many scales & is an adventure that wants you to never be afraid of exploring new things.

Iron Man," Iron Man Burns Bright In Red & Gold!
","Marking the commencement of Marvel Cinematic Universe, catapulting Robert Downey Jr. into the league of Hollywood's biggest stars & also announcing the arrival of Marvel Studios into motion picture filmmaking for it is their first fully-financed project, Iron Man not only succeeds as a quality blend of style & substance but is also amongst the best origin stories cinema has come up with for a comic book superhero.Iron Man tells the story of genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark who, while on his tour to war-torn Afghanistan for the demonstration of his new weaponry to United States military, is ambushed & taken hostage by a terrorist group. Working with another captive, he designs an exoskeleton to get out from there & after returning to US further refines his design. The plot covers the change his captivity brings in his entire personality.Stylishly directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man aims for the same grounded approach Nolan applied in Batman Begins & succeeds amazingly well for the most part. The screenplay is brimming with energy, wit & charm, and is brilliantly written & narrated. Production design provides it a very modern feel, Camera-work is vibrantly carried out, Editing briskly paces the whole story which also benefits from Ramin Djawadi's fitting score as well as clever use of existing songs.Coming to the acting department, Iron Man features a star-studded cast in Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges & Terrence Howard but the film belongs to Downey Jr. who blazes brightly in red n gold with a performance that's absolutely fantastic, effortlessly charismatic & downright polished. Overshadowing the input of the rest & fitting the suit perfectly, this is one role that couldn't have gone to a better actor & how this gifted talent renders Tony Stark on screen is a further proof of that.On an overall scale, Iron Man has enough power in it to please both fans of the comics as well as newcomers. Sure its third act isn't as impressive as the first two but the positives eclipse the negatives by a huge margin. Balancing its storytelling aspects with big budget extravaganza to triumph as a work of quality in the eyes of viewers n critics alike, Iron Man is a highly refreshing, wildly entertaining & largely satisfying crowd-pleaser that's hugely responsible for the foundation on which Marvel Studios stands today.

Creed II," A Rousing Sequel That's 33 Years In The Making
","The follow-up chapter to Creed does lack the freshness of the original but Creed II still manages to deliver an adrenaline-fuelled ride that's fun, rousing & rewarding for the most part, and features a story that's 33 years in the making as it pits two second generation boxers against one another in a match that's equally personal to both fighters.Strongly echoing Rocky IV, the story is set three years after the events of the last film and follows Adonis Creed who has now made his way to the top of the sport, and is the new world champion. But his celebration is cut short when he is issued a challenge by Viktor Drago, the son of former Soviet boxer Ivan Drago who killed Apollo Creed inside the ring over three decades ago.Directed by Steven Caple Jr, his treatment of the scripted material is very much by the books, for the story lacks any element of surprise and is predictable. The film addresses themes of family, legacy, loss, revenge, resurrection & redemption but the dramatic portions don't necessarily pack the same emotional punch that Ryan Coogler's film was able to land for the entirety of its runtime.The return of Ivan Drago is a welcome choice though, and his presence still retains a formidable aura. There isn't a lot for Rocky Balboa to do here yet the film comes alive whenever he is on screen. The boxing matches are brilliantly choreographed, training montages are expertly edited, and the music accompanying these scenes brim with a pulsating energy that only adds more fuel to the mix.Leading from the front in acting department is Michael B. Jordan who articulates Adonis Creed's journey through hellfire & brimstone with finesse, and he is terrific throughout. Sylvester Stallone dons his signature role for one last round and does well with what he's given. Dolph Lundgren returns as Ivan Drago and steals nearly every scene he's in. But it is the mentor-disciple dynamic between Balboa & Creed that gives this film its finest moments.On an overall scale, Creed II is neither wholly impressive in filmmaking terms nor resonant enough on emotional scale when compared to its ingeniously crafted predecessor but it does what it set out to do and despite the slump in storytelling quality, the film delivers a blood-pumping, pulse-pounding & adrenaline-rushing extravaganza that's entertaining & fulfilling enough to rank amongst the better entries in the once concluded but recently revived saga.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Fragmented, Frustrating & Forgettable
","Pitting two of the greatest behemoths against each other in what's a dream come true moment for comic book nerds, Batman v Superman was greatly anticipated by fans despite its predecessor failing to pave a strong foundation for DC Extended Universe to take off. Man of Steel was sloppy, bloated & underwhelming and this latest instalment is no better, for it is marred by an array of bad decisions, and is every bit deserving of the mauling it received at its time of release.The story of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice takes place 18 months after the first film and follows Superman who is now a controversial figure since no one can keep him in check. Amongst many who view him as a threat to humanity is the prince of Gotham himself who, after witnessing the destruction of Metropolis, has been looking for a weakness that he can exploit. Meanwhile, an eccentric business mogul is concocting his own devious plans to defeat Superman.The best way to proceed would be to simply point out what worked here & what didn't. Speaking of what works, most of Zack Snyder's trademarks that unexpectedly disappeared in the previous chapter make their welcome return in this instalment. The opening credits scene shows what he can do when allowed free reign, for the sublime manner in which that segment flips through Bruce Wayne's childhood is no short of a little masterpiece in itself. Unfortunately, everything after that is a downhill journey.Next up is Ben Affleck who got a lot of flak when he was chosen to don the Caped Crusader costume but he does a terrific job to silence his critics. The masked vigilante we meet in this film is unlike any previous rendition. He bears the scars of a veteran who doesn't mind pulling the trigger against his enemies anymore and is a badass version of a Batman who has seen it all & has set his morals aside to instil fear in the criminal world. The most impressive of all, however, is Diana Lane easily outshines anyone who falls in her vicinity.Cinematography envelops the story with a brooding layer, VFX team does a splendid job but its overabundant CGI action neither surprises nor elevates the experience by any measurable extent. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL is loud & deafening but there are times when it enhances the desired effect of few moments. These were the middling aspects. Now, let's talk about what doesn't work in the film's favour. First is the script itself, which exhibits the same set of issues that plagued Man of Steel.The writers once again tease with interesting ideas but never dig deeper than surface, thus leaving its characters devoid of depth and its plot all muddled up. The script packs many moments that add nothing but empty minutes to what already is an overlong flick. Next is Snyder's direction as he fails to steer the plot in the right direction or provide good enough pace to it. Editing is an absolute mess, for its 181 minutes of daunting runtime is severely felt, plus the narrative lacks a smooth flow.Henry Cavill did a convincing enough job in Man of Steel but his performance here is cold, for his character's trajectory stays nearly motionless in this sequel. Hamming all the way is Jesse Eisenberg and whatever idiosyncrasies he brings to this character only makes his input all the more annoying. Also, the big stuff, i.e. Batman & Superman going against each other, ultimately fails to live up to its hype. And lastly, its action-filled final act is so badly crammed & poorly handled that it fails to leave a memorable imprint.On an overall scale, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is another middling chapter in DCEU that had the ingredients to deliver an extravaganza worthy of matching the greatness of its hype but it crumbles under its own hefty expectations to finish as another effects-driven blockbuster. It isn't a total disaster though, for it packs a few moments that are embedded with little gems but its overall structure & narrative flow does lack a sturdy backbone. In a sentence, Batman v Superman is fragmented, frustrating & forgettable.",Null,3,5,22 July 2016
Blade Runner," A Visually Spellbinding Neo-Noir, Sci-Fi Classic That I Admire More Than I Love
","One of the most influential works of sci-fi & a prime example of neo-noir cinema, Blade Runner is an impeccable blend of jaw-dropping art direction, groundbreaking special effects, breathtaking photography, stellar sound & iconic score, and was way ahead of its time.Set in 2019 Los Angeles, the story follows a retired cop whose former job was to hunt down & 'retire' bioengineered androids called replicants, manufactured to be used as slaves in off-world colonies. But when four replicants commit mutiny, he is called out of retirement to track & eliminate them.Directed by Ridley Scott, Blade Runner showcases his obsession with details better than any of his works. Every set piece is refined to smallest of details and plays a key role in magnifying the film's overall look & feel. Scott unfolds things at a slow pace but neither its plot nor characters are as compelling as its futuristic setting.From the technical standpoint, Blade Runner is a marvel. Production design is one of its highlights that effectively bring its dystopian setting to life. The rain-soaked, polluted surrounding is an inspired choice while the apt use of color palette & ideal lighting amplify the visuals greatly. Special effects work is top-notch while Vangelis' synthesized score brims with a quality of its own.Coming to the performances, Harrison Ford plays Deckard with panache but it's the actor and not the script that makes this character stand out. Sean Young plays her part with a touch of innocence. Rutger Hauer's character doesn't seem interesting at first yet he is the one who leaves the most lasting impression of all in the end. And the rest deliver fine support in their given roles.On an overall scale, Blade Runner has aged remarkably well over the years and looks as spellbinding today as it did at its time of release. But its plot & characters lack that same level of sophistication from Scott, and the glacial pace makes it a frustrating sit. I appreciate a lot many things about it and do get its legacy but its story never stimulated me as deeply as its technical accomplishments did. Multiple viewings advised.",Null,0,3,17 October 2017
Monsters University," The Wait For Pixar's Return To Form Continues!
","From the creators of animation classics like Toy Story trilogy, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL·E & Up, Pixar Animation Studios' 14th feature film marks their first foray into prequels & although it's an enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying ride for the most part, it ultimately falls short of the quality of cinema we expect from Pixar.A prequel to Monsters Inc., Monsters University focuses on the relationship between Mike & Sulley during their college life, where they started off as rivals studying to be scarers. After the two are dropped from their courses for causing a fight, Mike takes part in Scary Games competition to prove his worth & reluctantly includes Sulley when his team falls short of one member.Directed by Dan Scanlon, the story does add more dimensions to our beloved characters & captures the college atmosphere in a vivid manner but it really isn't a film that was needed in the first place. Still, it's better that they made a prequel instead of a sequel. The direction is good but the story lacks originality & unlike the best of Pixar films, doesn't bring anything new to the table.The computer animation is top-level stuff, as expected from Pixar. The reprising characters have not lost any of their charm while the new ones are ingeniously envisioned, designed & rendered on the screen. The narrative follows a conventional route & is full of genre clichés yet the one aspect I liked most was what they did with the character arcs of Mike, Sulley & even Randy.Mike is presented as a monster who's told by everyone that he doesn't belong, which fuels his desire to become something important & respectable, despite his irreplaceable flaws. Sulley, however, enters the college with lots of aura & pride surrounding his family name but soon experiences the burden of living up to a legacy. While Randy is given a sad portrait of an insecure loner who later gets seduced by the dark side.There isn't much to complain in the technical categories either. Cinematography makes fine use of colour palette & camera movements are energetic. Editing paces the story nicely for its runtime is never felt, for the most part. Billy Crystal, John Goodman & Steve Buscemi do a great job in voicing their respective characters but it's Helen Mirren who surprises the most as Dean Hardscrabble. And Randy Newman is as amazing as always.Certainly not in the league of the original, Monsters University is still an absolutely hilarious, unabashedly rib-tickling & wildly entertaining laughter riot that offers loads of fun to viewers of all ages while those expecting another path-breaking cinema from Pixar are destined to be disappointed. I doubt people would be complaining as much if this film was released by some other animation studio but since it's Pixar, anything less than great is disappointing.On an overall scale, Monsters University is a wonderfully crafted tale about the beauty of friendship and provides a fascinating evolution of Mike & Sulley's relationship from hardcore rivals to inseparable friends. A roller-coaster ride of unlimited madness that will amaze the kids & take most grown-ups to a nostalgic tour of their college lives (hopefully) although I highly doubt that it will be remembered in the years to come. Worth a watch? The answer is a resounding yes.",Null,0,0,11 October 2013
Ben-Hur," One Of The Grandest Epics To Ever Grace The Silver Screen
","Winner of staggering 11 Academy Awards, Ben-Hur is a titanic production by every means, both in scope & ambition, that ranks amongst the grandest epics to ever grace the silver screen, features one of the most breathtaking moments in cinema history, and is valiantly brought to life through its lavish production design, skillful direction, sweeping cinematography, majestic score & strong lead performance from Charlton Heston.Ben-Hur tells the story of Judah Ben-Hur, a rich Jewish prince in Jerusalem who's betrayed by his childhood friend, now a commanding officer of Roman legions, when he refuses to sell out his own people to the Roman empire, resulting in his family being thrown in prison while the prince himself is sent to the galleys. The plot covers the epic journey he makes to return to his homeland & seek revenge against his so-called friend.Directed by William Wyler, this extremely ambitious project comes to life in grand detail and is told with patience, with little bursts of excitement at regular intervals. Wyler leaves no stone unturned to infuse a sense of grandeur to every sequence, and the meticulously detailed set pieces, Miklós Rózsa's epic score, and widescreen cinematography play an important role in realising this vision. But there are also many moments that go on for way too long.Running at 212 minutes, it's a daunting film to sit through and the relaxed narration plus plethora of moments that are stretched a tad too far don't make this ride any easier. The drama manages to be compelling but there are also scenes in between that overstay their welcome & slow down the plot considerably. Two segments stand out the most, one being the sequence in which a Roman Consul tests Ben-Hur's determination by overworking the slaves and the other is the following.Ever since its debut, the 9-minute chariot race sequence has been hailed by viewers & critics alike as one of the most astounding, jaw-dropping & extraordinary moments in motion picture history and it still remains one of the greatest accomplishments of epic filmmaking. Heading into it, I was doubtful that it may appear a bit dated now but it's such a gripping, intense & powerful sequence that it effortlessly exceeded all my expectations and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.Coming to the performances, the ensemble comprises of Charlton Heston, Jack Hawkins, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet & Hugh Griffith, and all of them chip in with strong inputs. Heston definitely is the standout and plays the titular character with restraint & passion. Another amazing thing about his performance is the apt chemistry he shares with every other member. The rest play their part accordingly. And one striking aspect I really liked was the angles chosen to depict Jesus Christ, never showing his face yet evoking a mythical vibe almost instantly.On an overall scale, Ben-Hur is well-deserving of all its accolades, for what it put on the screen at its time of release was nothing short of breathtaking. Like all great works, it has managed to stand the test of time and even though I had a difficult time sitting through its overly-stretched dramatic moments, I've nothing but admiration for its grandeur beauty. I'm not entirely sure if the picture as a whole will manage to live up to its hype for everyone, but that chariot race sequence is destined to dazzle its viewers and leave them absolutely speechless for decades to come.",Null,0,1,7 August 2016
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig's James Bond Is Here To Stay. Deal With It.
","Truth be told, the only James Bond films that I've seen in full are the ones starring Daniel Craig in the iconic role. Confession be made, I have no interest at all in checking out the previous instalments of this franchise for whatever bits n pieces I've seen of earlier chapters never intrigued me enough to sit through all of it. And since this film takes the series back to its origin, I don't see any need to give those films another chance, at least for now.Establishing a new timeline that has no relation whatsoever with any previous Bond movies, Casino Royale is a complete reboot of James Bond franchise that discards the CGI heavy plot & ridiculously over-the-top action of the previous entries to restart the series by reinventing the character of James Bond and, with its grounded portrayal of events set in 21st century & emphasis on realism during its action sequences, begins the new era of 007 on a rousing high.Opening with an exquisitely crisp black-n-white prologue that shows Bond earning his license to kill, Casino Royale covers James Bond's first ever mission as Agent 007 that requires him to stop a terrorist financier named Le Chiffre from winning in a high-stakes poker game. Already berated by M for his inability to properly address the situation before acting on it, Bond enters the tournament he can't afford to lose for it would result in government to have directly financed terrorism.Directed by Martin Campbell, the first in the new era of Bond films is a highly polished spy- thriller that delivers on all fronts to succeed as an intensely entertaining origin story that's neatly-crafted, action-packed & character-driven. Also, the screenplay packs in with a tightly structured plot plus the new take on the much less experienced & emotionally vulnerable character of Bond is as admirable as it is captivating.The technical aspects show a massive improvement over the last few entries as each element is carefully handled & seamlessly integrated into the picture. Cinematography makes expert use of colour palettes & lighting to put on screen a rich texture that's incredibly well-detailed. Editing briskly paces the story in the first two acts but runs out of fuel in the third. And David Arnold's score provides a more modern feel to the picture without going out of the franchise's realms.Everyone was sort of appalled when Daniel Craig was cast as the new Bond but the way he silenced all his critics is quite astonishing. Craig may not fit the version of Bond that had been put up on the silver screen since the beginning but for me, he's the perfect embodiment of this iconic character for he is everything James Bond is supposed to be; cold, ruthless, ironic & pretty much suave than any previous incarnations when blended with the range of emotions he has to offer.The performances are a strong highlight here with Daniel Craig's charismatic performance taking away the biggest chunk of the cake, followed by impressive contributions from Eva Green as Vesper Lynd; Bond's lover, Judi Dench as M; head of MI6, & Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre, the latter being instantly infectious in his given role. Also, with minimal use of CGI, less reliance on gadgets & old-school action, it keeps the drama all the more grounded & gripping throughout its runtime.On an overall scale, Casino Royale is a fabulous start to the rebooted franchise that truly nails most of its aspect to deliver a cinema that's wild & exciting from start to finish while also putting to rest every doubt there ever was about Daniel Craig's ability to do justice to one of cinema's most memorable characters. I was never a fan of James Bond but after checking this feature, I don't think I can resist the temptation anymore. Very highly recommended.",Null,0,4,8 December 2014

Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," An Absolute Riot That's Well-Aware Of Its Limits.
","Although Ice Age never needed a sequel to begin with, the success of the second chapter did give its studio another franchise to milk for all its worth. The third instalment in the Ice Age series once again fails to offer a compelling story but for me it is the most enjoyable chapter in the saga so far, thanks in particular to its energetic pace & vibrant slapstick humour.The story of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs finds Manny & Ellie venturing into parenthood as they are expecting a baby. Diego plans to leave the herd after suspecting that he's losing his predatory nature. And Sid comes across three seemingly-abandoned dinosaur eggs, deciding to adopt them, but is abducted by their real mother and is taken underground where an entire lost world exists.Directed by Carlos Saldanha, Dawn of the Dinosaurs packs in plenty of hilarious moments even if it doesn't offer anything rewarding in the storytelling department. Scrat's misadventures continue to be the series' highlight moments but the story's adventurous vibe is finely maintained. Manny gets an interesting arc to work with but the rest simply tag along. And the manic one-eyed weasel owns his moments.The fluid operation of the camera in addition to its vivid use of colour palette & fab implementation of the third dimension gives its images a rich texture & feel, new characters fit in with relative ease, Editing swiftly paces the narrative & there is attempt at humour in nearly every segment although not all of them work out. John Powell's score is in tune with unfolding set of events while the voice cast ably chip in with required inputs.On an overall scale, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a delightfully amusing, wildly entertaining & thoroughly mesmerising sequel that shouldn't even work but it does. It may not impress those who were expecting an emotionally rewarding tale with sensible characterisation but for those who are looking for a simple, relaxing & lighthearted extravaganza, it checkmarks all the required boxes. A romp ride that's well-aware of its limits, Dawn of the Dinosaurs is an absolute riot.",Null,1,1,16 April 2016
Before Sunrise," An Extraordinary Day in the Lives of Two Ordinary Strangers.
","Before Sunrise is a single day adventure in the lives of two strangers who meet on a train in Europe, begin a discussion, instantly connect with one another & slowly end up falling in love, all the while knowing that they have just this one evening to spend together & will be heading to their different directions the next day. From start to finish, there is no definite story or plot present in the film but only conversations about random things or each other and in the end, this chitchat between them turned out to be the only thing that mattered most because it told us everything there is to know about the characters, their views on life & love and even goes on to justify the existence of this story in the first place.Exquisitely directed by Richard Linklater, who came up with this story by taking a leaf out of his own life & refined the screenplay to a great length to give it a completely natural & instinctive appearance. The lush cinematography beautifully captures the dazzling locations of Vienna, the editing is brilliantly carried out and the performances by Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy as Jesse & Céline respectively is the core ingredient which provides this absolutely devouring dish its very own heart & soul. On an overall scale, Before Sunrise is one of the most intriguing, original & heartwarming romantic dramas I've had the pleasure to watch. Each frame here is as magical as love itself, and that's coming from a guy who isn't even very fond of this genre in the first place. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,8 January 2014
The Deer Hunter," One of the Most Overrated Films Ever Made.
","One of the first films to employ the subject of Vietnam War into its premise, The Deer Hunter tells the story of three young factory workers in Pennsylvania who enlist into the army to fight the ongoing war in Vietnam, only to discover that war isn't a noble venture they imagined but a hellish chaos which in the end, completely changes their entire personalities.The film is a three act feature in which the first act introduces its three primary characters, their friendships, the women they're in love with & their perspectives on life. The second act is set in Vietnam & covers the brutality they undergo there. And the final act depicts the massive change war has brought into not just their lives but also the society they are part of as a whole.Michael Cimino's direction is good in parts, camera-work & music are also a plus and the strong cast of Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, Meryl Streep & others do chip in with sincere performances but compared to the reputation & acclaim this film has enjoyed over the years, the experience of sitting through this snail-paced war drama didn't turn out to be even remotely satisfying.The Deer Hunter isn't really a war film but a tragic drama that aims to portray the personality change something as gruesome as war can bring in not just those who serve in it but an entire community which I actually appreciate but for the majority of its runtime, this film is a pain to sit through. The film is over three hours long which is strongly felt & filled with characters who are not that interesting anyway.It opens with a wedding sequence which, for a while, felt like will go on forever. The second act is set in Vietnam is the only part that had my attention & the Russian roulette scene is easily the film's best moment for it is extremely intense & brilliantly filmed. The final act is a disappointment again where we are supposed to draw a comparison with the first act & that's all there is to this feature.On an overall scale, there are moments of brilliance within the film yet for the most part, The Deer Hunter remains an underwhelming cinematic experience that's awfully boring, is far too long, presents a one-sided view of war, requires its audience to suspend disbelief greatly and, in my humble opinion which you don't have to agree with, is one of the most overrated films ever made.",Null,3,6,11 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," An Antidote To Hate & Prejudice
","An antidote to hate, prejudice & fearmongering that appears to be on the rise of lately, Jojo Rabbit takes a provocative subject matter, fills it up with heart, soul & compassion, and exquisitely juggles the hilarious with the serious to surprise us all as one of the most delightful, affectionate & endearing films of the year.Written & directed by Taika Waititi (best known for What We Do In the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople & Thor: Ragnarok), the film is an audaciously handled satire that blatantly parodies everything Nazi, and attempts to capture the utter absurdity of such ideologies by illustrating it all from a 10-year old's perspective.The lighthearted approach, simple-minded treatment & idiosyncratic characters inhabiting this black comedy do keep the fanciful tone alive n kicking but Waititi also makes sure that an undercurrent of seriousness is evident between the lines and the dramatic portions & dark moments do pack the required emotional punch.Adding more richness to the story is the sincere inputs from both the young & veteran members of the cast, each playing their roles with emotional honesty. Waititi himself portrays the childish, parodic version of Führer, and is amusing throughout. The interactions between characters remain interesting, plus their arcs exhibit genuine depth.On an overall scale, Jojo Rabbit is a witty, whimsical & warm-hearted effort from Taika Waititi that finds the Kiwi filmmaker doing what he does best and is another impressive addition to his repertoire. A passionately crafted satire with its heart at the right place, Jojo Rabbit might not appease every palate but its arrival is by all means a welcome one.

Fantastic Mr. Fox," Retains The Essence Of The Book
","An exquisitely crafted, gorgeously photographed & splendidly scripted adaptation of Roald Dahl's children novel of the same name, Fantastic Mr. Fox is an enjoyable, entertaining & endlessly exuberant delight for viewers of all ages, and employs its stop-motion animation in ways that only adds to its quirky flavour.Co-written & directed by Wes Anderson (known for The Grand Budapest Hotel & Isle of Dogs), the film retains the essence of the novel despite few modifications in the script and Anderson brings the fantasy world to life with sublime vibrancy & emotional precision. The images are rich & vivid like a finely stitched tapestry.Art direction team makes sure that the set pieces & character designs are in sync with the source of inspiration. The radiant camerawork, warm colour tones & apt lighting further enrich the visuals. Editing leaves out what it can do without, and unfolds the plot at a breezy pace. And vocal inputs from the entire cast is spot-on.Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a smartly directed, brilliantly written & outstandingly animated example of its genre that definitely ranks amongst the director's finest works.

","One of the most cleverly crafted & smartly executed action films of the 90s, Speed is an extremely riveting, high-octane action thriller that is downright engaging right from its opening moments & remains nail-bitingly tense throughout its runtime. The story here concerns a rookie cop who must board a bomb-rigged city bus & do whatever it takes to keep the speed above 50 mph or else the bomb goes off automatically.The pacing is fierce, the direction is impressive, the screenplay is taut, the editing is tight, and the performances by Keanu Reeves & Sandra Bullock along with an intense score makes Speed a smooth ride with very few bumps along the road. One of the best chase films of its or any other time with far too many memorable sequences than any typical film of its genre, Speed is an intelligent & highly entertaining cinematic ride that still hasn't aged a day.A timeless classic that can be enjoyed over n over again without any loss in its potency, Speed effortlessly manages to kick some serious ass than most action films of today even when so many years have passed.

Son of Saul," Absolutely Worthy Of All Its Accolades, Son of Saul Is Essential Viewing.
","The latest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Son of Saul (also known as Saul fia) is an exceptionally powerful, relentlessly grim & downright disturbing cinema that takes a leaflet out of mankind's darkest phase and weaves an original, absorbing & deeply affecting story around it, all depicted in a manner that only magnifies the haunting horrors of the Holocaust.The story of Son of Saul takes place inside the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II and covers a day or two in the life of a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner who, along with a selected few, is tasked with the disposal of the corpses of gas chamber victims. The plot follows his dangerous & desperate attempt to provide a proper Jewish burial to the body of a young boy he takes for his son.Co-written & directed by László Nemes, Son of Saul marks his feature film debut and it is by every means a sensational start to his directional career. The film is disquieting from the very first scene that takes us through Saul's daily duty in the camp and it is through his eyes that we get a glimpse of genocide in fully-operational mode. And all of it is shown from such an extreme close-up that it is bound to discomfort many.The deftly written screenplay is worthy of mention as well for it keeps a stringent focus on what's going on with the protagonist amidst all the horror, chaos & despair and never for once leaves his side. The decision to illustrate the brutal life of Sonderkommando is commendable too for they've been a subject of controversy throughout history as many consider them to be collaborators who assisted the Nazi in exterminating their own race.Son of Saul shows that Sonderkommando were no less victims than other prisoners in the camp for they had no control of their destinies, were inducted into the unit regardless of their choice & were forced to act under the threat of death. Their slightly improved living conditions compared to other prisoners only existed because they were needed by Germans to keep their death factories running and while it was a cruel situation for them to be in, it did help them survive longer than the others.Cinematography is a definite highlight for the camera stays alongside Saul throughout his ordeal & serves as his companion at all times. It also employs shallow focus to blur the genocidal massacre taking place in the background and the unusual aspect ratio it opts for further helps in realising its narrow field of vision. Many segments are shot in single, unbroken takes plus the very atmosphere of despair & gruesome horror is effectively maintained over the course of its 107 minutes runtime.Sound design is another impressive element that, through the expertly assembled screams, cries & pleadings, gives the viewers a perception of what's happening around Saul at any given time, thus allowing them to imagine the horrible imagery on their own. And just like the stellar camera-work, it stays within the main character's field of vision & hearing. Editing is brilliantly carried out for there isn't even one inessential sequence present in the final print and all events unfold at a steady pace.Coming to the performances, Géza Röhrig carries the entire picture on his shoulders and delivers a very strong, finely layered & emotionally resonant rendition of his character. For the most part, it's a silent showcase from Röhrig as the camera relies only on his body language to express what he's going through and he truly nails that part. Rest of the supporting cast also chip in with outstanding inputs but the film's real payoff is in witnessing a man's efforts to carry out a humane deed amidst reckless evil.On an overall scale, Son of Saul is a profoundly upsetting, absolutely devastating & emotionally scarring cinema that captures the implementation of Nazi's 'Final Solution to the Jewish Question' from an unsettling close-range, provides an authentic sense of what it's like to be in a living hell, and works as both a thrilling drama & an informative historical piece that retains all the harrowing reality of the Holocaust without abandoning its own story. Absolutely worthy of all its accolades, inarguably the best film of 2015, and a must-watch for all, this Hungarian masterpiece is essential viewing in every sense of the word & comes very highly recommended.",Null,0,4,6 April 2016
X2: X-Men United," Arguably Bigger, Better & Stronger Than Its Predecessor.
","Bigger, stronger & arguably better than its predecessor, X2 is a terrific follow-up to the first X- Men film which moves the story of X-Men universe forward while also expanding it in a controlled manner. The story here puts the X-Men & Brotherhood against a military scientist who's planning to annihilate the entire mutant species by manipulating Professor Charles Xavier & his mutant-tracking computer, Cerebro.Opening with an explosive sequence set in the White House & accompanied by Mozart's Requiem music in the background, director Bryan Singer expertly sets the pace of this second instalment which never really slows down by much till the very end. The writing is also good with enough time devoted for the introduction of new characters as well as for its own story to uncover. VFX look dated today but that's expected yet the basic elements of the film work spectacularly well.Coming to the performances, the recurring cast make a solid contribution to the film while the new characters are interesting, gradually developed & definitely not wasted away. The most impressive amongst all turned out to be Mystique once again plus it also reveals a little backstory of Wolverine character. Cinematography is sharp, editing is tight & music does a better job here than it did in the previous film.On an overall scale, X2 (also promoted as X2: X-Men United or simply X-Men 2) is a rare sequel that meets the expectations raised by the success of the original. And even though its story may not have the same quality as its predecessor, the action & other elements still end up making a pretty satisfying, enjoyable & very entertaining cinematic experience.

Thor: The Dark World," Marvel Fans Will Be Satisfied. Can't Say About The Rest.
","The second trip to Asgard may not be as memorable or refreshing as the first time but it is still capable of leaving the majority of its audience sufficiently pleased for the filmmakers are well-aware of what made the first film click so well & they deliver plenty of those elements in a more refined fashion yet when it comes to pure storytelling aspects, it's only as good as the original.A direct sequel to Thor & the eight instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: The Dark World continues the story of its titular character & covers the aftermath of the events that took place in The Avengers as Loki is brought to trial in Asgard & is sentenced to life imprisonment but when an ancient enemy returns to finish an incomplete job, both brothers team up to save all the existing realms from falling into perpetual darkness.Directed by Alan Taylor, Thor: The Dark World opens on the same note as its predecessor i.e. with a prologue that foreshadows the events about to be unfolded in the story. The screenplay smears the surface of what it wanted to explore but never really tries to dig a little deeper. Visuals & action offer a slight improvement than before, Cinematography rightly aims for a darker tone, the narrative is finely paced while Brian Tyler once again chips in with a good score.Coming to the performances, the cast that was put together in the first film continues to play a relevant role in this one except for a new villain who isn't intimidating at all. While a few of them are given more to do with their characters, some still manage to come off as annoying and frankly, the best thing about this sequel is the chemistry between Hemsworth & Hiddleston as Thor & Loki, respectively, as both are quite charismatic in their given roles, especially Hiddleston.On an overall scale, Thor: The Dark World half-heartedly tries to delve into a darker territory yet is filled with sequences that'll prevent its viewers from taking it seriously. Every scene featuring Tom Hiddleston only lifts the whole story up as even the wit applied in those brief moments work out brilliantly in the film's favour. I guess most Marvel fans will probably be satisfied with it but I can't say the same for newcomers because despite being an enjoyable & entertaining ride for the masses, Thor: The Dark World still feels a bit hollow from the inside.",Null,0,1,29 March 2015
Amélie," Without Amélie, Today's Cinema Would Be The Scurf of Yesterday's
","One of the most adorable, original & sweetest movies of all time, Amélie (also known as Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain) is a beautifully crafted, exquisitely narrated & gorgeously rendered tale about the simple things in life that usually are far more valuable than we deem it to be and throughout its runtime, all it attempts to do is to make us pause & admire those small wonders that abound around us at all times.Presenting its peculiar story with irresistible charm & incomparable wonderment, Amélie is a celebration of life that is captured in such an inventive manner that every single frame of it is an aesthetic work of art & passion and with its insanely magical blend of all aspects, the film also triumphs as arguably the finest effort to come out from French cinema & certainly ranks amongst the greatest motion pictures of all time.The story of Amélie follows its titular character; an innocent, young & extremely shy woman in her early twenties who, after making a surprising discovery in her apartment one day & using it for a certain good deed that pays off immensely well, dedicates herself to helping others find joy & happiness in their own lives in the most unexpected yet delightful manners while struggling with the isolation of her very own life.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who incorporated chapters of his very own life into the film, Amélie is brought to life in a style that completely defies conventions from beginning to end. Throughout its runtime, it ponders on moments that seem irrelevant to the narrative at hand yet without those little snippets, Amélie wouldn't be the same film for they add a great deal of sweetness into the picture & this level of unusualness is present in every single aspect.The screenplay is equally good with best parts being how it opens the story, introduces all its characters, paces the narrative & keeps it all glued together. Cinematography in itself is a heartwarming delight that exhibits rich, resonant & remarkable use of colour palette that captures Paris in stunning detail & vividness. Editing provides a refined pace to the whole film and although its 122 minutes of runtime sounds fair, I wish this splendid beauty never ended.Coming to the performances, Audrey Tautou as Amélie Poulain is adorable beyond belief & effortlessly manages to win hearts with her extraordinary performance. Beautifully capturing the innocent, naive & shy nature of her character, it's impossible for me to imagine someone else playing this role because Audrey turned out to be the very definition of Amélie as if she was born to play her. The immensely cute Flora Guiet also deserves a mention for she was equally amazing as young Amélie.And last but not the least is Yann Tiersen's mesmerising score which seamlessly integrates into the narrative to further elevate the joyous, cheerful & pleasant ambiance present in the picture and, together with other aspects, effortlessly succeeds in transcending its viewers to an otherworldly experience for 2 hours. The storytelling is unique, the performances are superb, the music is powerfully evocative, the direction is simply impressive craftsmanship, and because of all that there's no denying that Amélie delivers on all fronts.On an overall scale, Amélie is a celebration of selfless good deeds, the joy of little things, the satisfaction one gets in making a person smile and how our actions can really inspire & change someone's life forever. A whimsical journey & a life-altering drama that remains one of the most heartening & gratifying film experiences of my life, this is one masterpiece that left me smiling like a maniac like never before & I really mean it when I say that 'Without Amélie, today's cinema would be the scurf of yesterday's'.

Moonrise Kingdom," A Children's Adventure Made For Adults
","Wonderfully pictured, deftly written & nicely performed, Moonrise Kingdom tells the tale of a pair of young lovers who flee together from their town which causes the local search party to fan out & find them. Those who are not familiar with the director's previous works might find it quite weird, just like me, and yet the best part of this film is its eccentricity only.Be it Wes Anderson's quirky direction, idiosyncratic characters, cheerful performances, gorgeous cinematography, strange costumes or peculiar music, every single element of the film manages to work here because of its bizarreness. Bruce Willis & Edward Norton deliver fine performances from its ensemble cast but it's the child actors who take away the big chunk of applause, especially Kara Hayward.On an overall scale, taking us back to the time when we couldn't wait to grow up, when we had our first crushes & when we simply wanted to run away from home after a small fight, Moonrise Kingdom is an original story of young love & innocence and is a children's adventure made for adults which in the end didn't turn out to be as emotionally rewarding for me as it has for others.",Null,0,1,14 October 2013
The Sixth Sense," One Of The Most Original, Clever & Intelligently Made Horror Flicks Of The Past 20 Years.
","Blending the emotional depth of a heartfelt story with the chilling vibes of a modern horror, The Sixth Sense is M Night Shayamalan's breakthrough feature film that's patiently crafted, skilfully narrated & efficiently performed and still remains his finest directional effort to date. Noted for its foreboding atmosphere, brilliant use of visual motifs & that final masterstroke, it's an excellent example of quality storytelling.Set in Philadelphia, the story of The Sixth Sense follows a child psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients on the day he was honoured for his work. The plot then jumps to next fall where we see him clearly affected by the whole incident as he takes on a new case of a 9-year old boy who's exhibiting signs of the same illness that his ex-patient did. When he commits to helping him, the boy confides his secret to him.Written & directed by M Night Shayamalan, The Sixth Sense remains the only film that I've seen of his and the patience & maturity with which he has translated this scripted story on the film canvas is no short of amazing. The screenplay makes sure that each character has a well-defined arc, the symbolic & thematic elements are nicely addressed, those twists n turns are cleverly placed and it keeps its secret well-preserved until the final revelation.Set pieces, shooting locations & overcast weather conditions really help in creating a dark setting, the fluid movements & sustained focus of its camera, in addition to proper lighting & correct colour tones, add more enhancements to its ominous setting, Editing provides a smooth flow to the whole narrative & unfolds it at a steady pace. James Newton Howard's score comprises of tracks that effortlessly integrate into the storyline to further amplify the whole experience.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osmont, Tori Collette & Olivia Williams, with Willis & Osmont impressing the most. Willis is very restraint in his performance here, Osmont wonderfully captures the plight of his character & is able to express it convincingly, the scenes between Willis & Osmont are surprisingly fascinating, Collette does well as the concerned mother and the arc of each one of these characters is fully realised on the screen.On an overall scale, The Sixth Sense delivers the chills without for once discarding its firm grip on the viewers' senses, maintains a stunning balance between all filmmaking aspects, and continues to be counted amongst the most original, clever & intelligently made horror flicks of the past 20 years. While it'll definitely surprise the newcomers, the only drawback The Sixth Sense has in my opinion is that its effect begins to wear off more n more on each subsequent viewing. Nevertheless, it's a must for every horror fanatic.",Null,0,2,6 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens!
","Set in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Force Awakens (also called Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens) takes place about thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi and follows three people. First is Resistant pilot Poe Dameron who, while trying to obtain intel regarding the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker is taken hostage by the First Order, a military power that arose from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Second is Finn, a reformed First Order stormtrooper who frees Poe from his captivity before they crash-land on a desert planet. And third is Rey, a self- sufficient scavenger who after encountering BB-8 (Poe's droid) & Finn, embarks on an adventure that finds her & Finn joining the fight alongside the Resistance in order to bring down the First Order, commanded by Kylo Ren, a dark warrior strong with the Force.Co-written, co-produced & directed by J.J. Abrams, best known for infusing a new life into the then-derailing Mission: Impossible series and later rebooting the Star Trek franchise for the present generation, The Force Awakens brims with nostalgic touches & clever homages to the original trilogy while moving forward with its own story and is an action-packed sequel that stays true to its origins. There's a gleam of freshness that permeates every frame of this latest chapter in the Star Wars series and Abrams does a spectacular job in finding that balance between its spectacle & drama. While the elements that made its past chapters a frustrating experience for me are still there but it's good to see that the story is more focused on the human characters than the dumb aliens. Although the plot follows a predictable route, it offers plenty of fun throughout its runtime.The script packs in a narrative that almost qualifies as a remake of A New Hope but what's refreshing to see is the stability the writers aspire for while focusing on the old & new characters. The new additions are given an interesting arc to work with while the veterans take care of the nostalgic elements in addition to their added contributions. The action is exciting and makes its presence felt on regular basis, humour is effectively utilised, its adventurous vibe is consistently maintained, and both the light & dark side of the Force is handled with care. A few twists & surprises are also in store which keep the entertainment going plus it also paves the groundwork for next episodes in line. Another welcome aspect of The Force Awakens is just how well it works for even those who aren't familiar with the saga, while at the same time providing a pleasant experience to its loyal fanbase.The technical aspects are expertly executed with J.J. Abrams opting for the old-school methods to bring this blockbuster to life. Production design team does a magnificent job with their splendidly detailed set pieces while the wonderfully chosen shooting locations add an otherworldly feel to it. Cinematography makes exquisite use of colour palette, dynamic camera movements, familiar transitions & clever angles to give its images a retro vibe. Another surprise is the absence of solar flares, a rarity in Abrams' features. Editing is firmly carried out yet its 135 minutes of runtime feels slightly overlong. Visual effects is highly commendable with traditional effects preferred over CGI although the latter is still present in sufficient dose. Last but not the least, John Williams returns to the Star Wars saga for the seventh time to contribute with another beguiling score that blends with the unfolding events in a seamless fashion.Performance has never been this franchise's strongest suit but The Force Awakens packs a few surprises in this department too. Returning to the fold are Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher & Mark Hamill in their iconic roles of Han Solo, Leia Organa & Luke Skywalker respectively and the stupid- looking characters such as R2-D2, C-3PO & Chewbacca are also present. But it's the new cast comprising of Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac & Adam Driver who impress the most. Ridley is a revelation in the role of Rey, Boyega's performance is equally compelling, Isaac is effortlessly charismatic as Poe and even though Driver's Kylo Ren is no Darth Vader, he still makes up for an interesting villain for he's highly relatable with our current world's real face of terror. However, the standout character in my opinion is that baby-faced, football-shaped droid called BB-8 which evoked instant adoration from its first appearance & steals every scene it is in.On an overall scale, Star Wars: The Force Awakens commences a new era in Star Wars saga and is a fine example of epic filmmaking that's just as committed to its narrative & characters as it is to its state-of-the-art visuals. Much of its plot is a repackage of A New Hope but I found it to be more involving than the original for some reason. Rarely any film has faced the level of hype this latest episode of Star Wars was subjected to and even though it didn't exceed all expectations, it did deliver an incredibly fun, consistently entertaining & thoroughly satisfying experience that scores high marks in both quality & quantity. Once again, J.J. Abrams has succeeded in resurrecting a dusted franchise and signs off at a point from where numerous possibilities for the sequels emerge, and it's going to be interesting to see what direction the next two episodes will head in. But until that time, The Force Awakens is definitely a cause for celebration for this latest episode accomplishes nearly everything its fans anticipated & then some more.",Null,5,40,29 January 2016
Flight," A Flat Drama Bookended By Great Moments!
","Marking director Robert Zemeckis' return to live-acting filmmaking, presenting actor Denzel Washington in yet another impressive role to which he does complete justice, and working as an insightful meditation on addiction & the difficulties faced when trying to cope with it, Flight is bookended by high moments but everything between the two ends simply falls flat.The story of Flight follows an airline pilot who, after crash-landing his malfunctioning plane in a miraculous manner & saving almost everyone on board, is hailed as a hero. But when further investigation into the matter reveals the possibility of him being intoxicated during the flight, he decides to sober up till his day in court, but soon finds out how hard it actually is to let go of an addiction.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Flight is his first live-action film since his 2000 feature, Cast Away, and exhibits no major loss in his form. Zemeckis showcases a firm grip on the visual elements of the story but the script is all over the place for instead of focusing on just one character this film is about, it tries to cram in events that have no reason to exist, as can be seen in the added romantic angle.The technical aspects are finely executed but the story hits a rough patch in the middle with some slow-paced moments, some of which don't add much to the whole plot. Coming to the performances, Flight is a one man show that benefits greatly from Denzel Washington's outstanding input for the grounded finesse with which he portrays his character certainly makes this feature a character study worth sitting through.On an overall scale, Flight began on an absolutely thrilling note but from there on, it heads in only one direction and while the climax is moving to an extent, it's a tedious road to get there. Nevertheless, the film works as an intriguing observation of a man struggling to cope with his addiction, is redeemed to an extent by a knockout performance from Washington, and while inclining more towards a disappointment as per my initial expectations, it does have its moments that may work out for you. Worth a shot.",Null,1,3,7 October 2013

Rear Window," A Masterpiece of Suspense & Mystery that is Impossible to Resist or Ignore.
","The year of 1954 saw director Alfred Hitchcock in sublime form as he delivered not one but two back-to-back masterpieces of its genre & cemented his status as the greatest filmmaker of thrillers & suspense. While one of the two was Dial M for Murder which even today remains one of his most enjoyable & entertaining works, the other is Rear Window which many consider to be one of the greatest films ever made.Rear Window perfectly demonstrates the impulse of morbid curiosity and tells the story of a wheelchair bound photographer who, while confined in his apartment, spends his recovery time by spying on his neighbours through the rear window. Things are set in motion when he becomes obsessed with a particular neighbour's life whom he suspects of murdering his wife and enlists the help of his socialite girlfriend & visiting nurse to investigate.Superbly directed by Hitchcock with great use of suspense, the film presents the director in complete control of his filmmaking wizardry & is smartly scripted too. The camera-work presents some admirable level of craftsmanship in its photography & keeps the picture colourfully detailed. And thanks to its tight editing, terrific performances from James Stewart, Grace Kelly & others plus clever use of music, the tension & excitement never leaves the film for one instant.On an overall scale, Rear Window is a masterpiece of suspense & mystery that's difficult to resist & impossible to ignore for its tale of a man peeping into his neighbourhood reflects the same about our society which is filled with people more interested in their neighbour's lives than their own. One of the finest examples of its genre, Rear Window reminds why Hitchcock is still without an equal when it comes to thrillers and is a thrilling & unforgettable cinematic experience that mustn't be missed.",Null,0,3,7 October 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Greatest Film Trilogy of All Time
","Every tale embarks us on a new journey, every journey eventually comes to its inevitable end. As for The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring turned out to be a genre-defining classic. The Two Towers somehow raised the bar to an even higher level. And although it did seem near- impossible for The Return of the King to triumph over such towering expectations but against all odds, this final journey of Middle-Earth delivers everything to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary saga to an epic & magnificent conclusion.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the culmination of the wonderful journey we embarked on with The Fellowship of the Ring & picks up the story right from where it was left off in The Two Towers. The story finds Frodo & Sam continuing their quest towards Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring while the rest of the fellowship prepares for their final battle as the dark lord Sauron turns his eye on Gondor. But in the end, it all comes down to Frodo & the One Ring to decide the final fate of Middle- Earth.Directed by Peter Jackson, this remains his finest directional achievement & The Lord of the Rings as a whole is certainly his magnum opus. Making all films in a trilogy succeed on every scale is no mere achievement but to make the next instalment work better than its predecessor two times in a row is even rarer. And yet, Jackson manages to accomplish exactly that with his sweeping cinematic vision, stunning eye for detail & in-depth knowledge of balancing emotional storytelling with large-scale action entertainment.The screenplay is cleverly adapted from the source material as many right choices were made in the decision of what to include & what to leave out from the final script. Fran Walsh also tries her hand at direction as the opening prologue is her creation. Being the final film in the trilogy, there's a sense of urgency in this chapter but it still ties up all the loose ends appropriately, gives proper farewells to its characters & delivers a high-quality entertainment of such epic proportions that fans couldn't have asked for a better finale.Coming to the technical aspects, Production design adds even more amazing & meticulously detailed sets to its story, the dazzling cinematography further magnifies the visual presentation to make the cinematic experience even more magical and Howard Shore's epic score is filled with tracks that are truly imposing, beautiful & further expand the domain of its predecessors as the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings remains the greatest work of his illustrious career.VFX is once again its most groundbreaking feat, however, this time it isn't a slight advancement but a pretty huge leap. Everything that made its brief appearance in the first two chapters is fully explored in this finale plus the length, scope & magnitude of battle sequences it offers is second to none. Also, with better rendering of its CGI characters & stunning level of craftsmanship in costumes, make-up & sound, The Return of the King sets a new benchmark for visuals in cinema that remains unequaled, as of today, in the scope of how much it contributed to the film's art while elevating the whole story.Despite running at 201 minutes, there were many things which got omitted from the theatrical cut & that's why the extended edition is more recommended. Also, many happen to criticize the last 45 minutes it takes to finally end but if you ever watch The Lord of the Rings in one sitting, then it'll make perfect sense to you because not only is it a reasonably enough time to recover the audience from what is an emotionally draining experience but also provides proper farewells that each one of its characters deserved.Coming to the performances, The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers introduced almost all characters we needed to be acquainted with & The Return of the King simply brings their arcs to completion. Unlike the previous two films in which Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) & Gollum (Andy Serkis) turned out to be the most impressive characters, respectively, there is no single dominating performance in this chapter as its entire cast puts up a more mature on-screen portrayal of their respective characters & never really leaves anything major to complain about.J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is unanimously hailed by critics & readers alike as the greatest fantasy novel ever written & a milestone in the works of literature. And it's amazing that its film adaptation follows the same route in the world of cinema. It did catapult Peter Jackson into the big leagues of Hollywood while also setting up Weta Digital as one of the foremost VFX studios on the planet but where it made its biggest impact is on cinema itself for it changed everything there ever was about epic & fantasy filmmaking, is one of the most important films of the modern era & a landmark moment in the annals of cinema.On an overall scale, The Return of the King is more than just a fitting conclusion to The Lord of the Rings. It triumphs as one of the greatest sequels ever made but along with The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers, it also makes up for cinema's greatest motion picture trilogy that will not soon, if ever, find its equal. An unprecedented achievement in the world of filmmaking that's epic in every sense of the word, The Lord of the Rings, in some ways, is to cinema what its source material was to literature & it is destined to remain a standard by which all future film trilogies will be measured for decades to come.",Null,1,2,5 October 2013
Munich," 'There is No Peace at the End of This'
","A provocative illustration of the aftermath of 1972 Munich massacre, a tricky meditation on morality & arguably the most controversial film of Steven Spielberg's filmmaking career, Munich is an intimately crafted, meticulously detailed & technically sound cinema that dares to examine both sides of a single coin yet ends up being an unsatisfying, convoluted mess.Based on the infamous incident at 1972 Olympics in Munich where 11 Israeli athletes were slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists, the story of Munich follows the aftermath of that event and focuses on the secret retaliation program carried out by the Israeli government to track down & kill the alleged members of Black September; the group responsible for the Munich massacre.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film opens with an extremely accurate depiction of the massacre, followed by Israel's own response to the terror attack and for the first half of its 163 minutes of runtime, it's very engaging. But then the gear shifts, the fictional elements start taking over the factual ones & the control is eventually lost as the story entangles itself into one mess after another.Technically, the film is as accomplished as any other Spielberg feature. Most of its depicted events are factually correct, Production design team manages to recreate the environment with strong emphasis on authenticity, Cinematography makes excellent use of the camera & lighting, Editing paces the film at its own desired pace but could've used a bit of acceleration while John Williams delivers with an emotionally-scarring score.Coming to the performances, Munich features a pretty reliable cast in Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz & others, and while their characters do have a depth & the performances are equally good, this aspect of the film never really stands out. Also, it was good to see the film not submitting itself to a one-sided perspective for it questions the whole act of retaliation, if it was worth it in the end & if it in any way accomplished anything.On an overall scale, Munich is one of Steven Spielberg's most polarising works that's going to divide its audience with the difficult questions it has in store but purely from storytelling perspective, there was enough room for improvement as the story completely fails to hold its grasp in the later half. Nevertheless, Munich still makes up for an intriguing experience & shows a new dimension of Spielberg that many will find rewarding and for that, it's definitely worth a shot.",Null,1,1,14 October 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' Lives Up To Its Legacy
","A cleverly envisioned, multi-layered & stylishly violent slasher that keeps its viewers guessing by blurring the lines between dream & reality, A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the most popular works of 1980s horror that spawned a franchise of its own, and is also notable for bringing one of the most iconic villains in cinema history into existence.The story of A Nightmare on Elm Street revolves around a group of teenagers who are tormented by a clawed killer who stalks & kills his victims in their dreams. The plot follows a young girl who finds herself to be the chosen one after she begins having nightmares of being pursued by the same killer and must soon find a way out before it's too late.Written & directed by Wes Craven, the story features an interesting concept and Craven brings it to life with finesse by continuously challenging its audience throughout its runtime. The execution works for the most part, a foreboding sense of terror is skilfully maintained, and even though the human characters aren't that compelling, their peril & confusion is still relatable.The technical aspects are finely executed. The small-town setting fits its narrative, camera-work is controlled and firmly elevates the suspense when required, Editing paces the story amazingly well, and music only enhances the overall experience. However, the most impressive thing about A Nightmare on Elm Street is the input by its special effects crew & make-up department.The practical effects may have dated today and bits n pieces of it even looks cartoonish but there is still much to admire about it, for some scenes are filmed in a truly inventive manner. Its make-up team also deserves a mention, for they played a vital role in realising the physical attributes of the villain on the film canvas and their painstaking effort does stand out in the final print.The cast comprises of Heather Langencamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon, Ronee Blakley & Johnny Depp in his debut role. Langencamo is hyper at times but for the most part, she does well. Saxon & Blakley just tag along, for their characters are mere caricatures. Depp sleeps his way through most of the story but signs off in spectacular style. Englund chips in with an over-the-top performance but it works in favour of the movie.There is a level of uniqueness to every single characteristic of the antagonist, and Craven smartly uses all of it to amplify the tension & creepiness. Be it the burnt face or metal-clawed glove or red- n-green striped sweater or even the fedora hat, the smallest of these features contribute to shape a nightmarish figure on the silver screen while Englund takes him up by a further few notches and wholly embraces the nightmare-demon.On an overall scale, A Nightmare on Elm Street is an excellent blend of imagination, creativity & old-school suspense that has etched itself into the annals of horror cinema over the years and remains a staple of pop-culture after all this time. Its dated effects & exaggerated violence may result in a few unintentional laughs but the way few of its scenes are shot nevertheless evoke a deep sense of respect & admiration. In short, Wes Craven's signature film lives up to its legacy.",Null,0,1,6 September 2016
The Truman Show," An Impressive Satirical Take On The Absurdity of Reality Television.
","A straight shot into my all-time favourites, an excellent satire of reality television & an impressive demonstration of the power of media, The Truman Show is one of the most original, creative & thought-provoking ideas to surface on the silver screen and wonderfully balances its elements of comedy with drama to deliver a cinema that's as entertaining as it is enlightening.The Truman Show chronicles the life of Truman Burbank whose entire life has been nothing but a 24x7 running TV show. The city he lives in is a huge studio with hidden cameras everywhere & the people he interacts with on a daily basis are paid actors but when a series of events force him to question the world around him, Truman embarks on a quest to discover the truth.Written by Andrew Niccol & directed by Peter Weir, the best thing about The Truman Show is that unlike many high-concept films of its genre, it manages to keep itself grounded throughout its runtime and with its light-hearted narration, easily penetrates into the minds of even the most casual viewers without for once compromising with its entertainment factor.The production design is no short of amazing as the entire city resonates a sense of artificiality like a movie set yet has a certain realism to it, cinematography makes expert use of camera angles by capturing the events from different point of views thus adding more authenticity to the plot, editing keeps the drama flowing smoothly & music also manages to make its presence felt.Coming to the performances, the film features an interesting cast in Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris & others and, stepping aside from his typecast roles, Carrey surprises everyone with a dense, dramatic & well-balanced performance that is truly heartwarming. Ed Harris plays the show's creator who really cares about Truman in his own way but loves his show too & Harris did a terrific job in capturing both sides of his character.On an overall scale, The Truman Show is a stellar work of quality whether you put it in the genre of comedy, science-fiction, drama or all at once & is equally effective as a meditation on the various themes it deals with, be it religion, philosophy, artificiality or existentialism. A heartfelt, hilarious & satirical take on the absurdity of reality television, The Truman Show is one of the finest examples of how to blend art with entertainment in order to make it work for the masses. Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,7 September 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Every Revolution Begins With A Spark
","The second chapter of The Hunger Games series continues the journey of Katniss Everdeen & although it presents quite an improvement over its predecessor, it still couldn't avoid the typical trappings of its genre that stopped it from being a great sequel. Katniss & Peeta being crowned the winner of the 74th Hunger Games ended up starting an uprising against the Capitol because of which Snow himself wants them to put everything to rest during the victory tour. But when things go opposite as planned, Snow changes the rules of the games on its 75th anniversary to bring other tributes into a single game in which only one could emerge a winner, thus bringing back Katniss & Peeta to compete once again.What improves compared to the previous film is clearly visible in the film's themes & tone, which are explored in more detail here. The visual effects are also better due to more budget, the production design team has done a fine job despite few missteps here n there & the reprising cast has played their characters with more maturity this time. Leading from the front is Jennifer Lawrence once again who turns out to be the best thing in the film & steals the show for the second time in a row as the Girl on Fire. What's also nice to see is a character arc for Katniss at last in the script, something which was very much missing in the last film. Francis Lawrence's direction is pretty energetic but the film still ends up running longer than it should have.Things not working in favour of Catching Fire is its stale characters. Apart from Katniss, there is no one really who we care about & most of the new cast doesn't even get a proper introduction. The costumes & makeup remain cartoony like the previous film. Editing surely leaves out many moments that could've been trimmed. And just like its predecessor, Catching Fire takes too much time before we get to see the games plus the ending also could've been a better chosen one. Still, on an overall scale, where most sequels crash & burn, Catching Fire burns bright & shiny and is a more polished & robust sequel and is arguably as refreshingly entertaining, if not more, as The Hunger Games.",Null,1,13,22 January 2014

Godzilla," Godzilla the Monster Ruled. Godzilla the Movie Didn't.
","After the disaster that was Roland Emmerich's version of Godzilla, for which the son of a bitch isn't even sorry, this 60th anniversary feature is the 2nd coming of the giant monster & is supposedly the reboot of Godzilla film franchise. Set in contemporary timeline, it depicts Godzilla as 'a terrifying force of nature' who is pitted against malevolent creatures who for years have been feeding on nuclear radiations but now threaten the very existence of humanity. But the bigger question is whether it resurrects the legacy of the King of the Monsters and the answer to it is both yes & no.Director Gareth Edwards uses the same formula that he applied in his debut feature, Monsters, only for it to not work in the end. Too much time is devoted to the human drama which really wouldn't have been a problem if by any means it was interesting or properly executed. Also, he's able to build up the tension but then cuts it just when it's getting more exciting, leading to frustration on the part of viewers. And the humour is absent to give an impression of a serious film but the script adds nothing to that aspired seriousness, thus leaving the drama pretty hollow.Still, barring one aspect, the technical filmmaking is worthy of all the praise. Art direction meticulously designs, details & renders the creatures on the screen. Cinematography expertly manages to create an aura of impending doom. VFX is as spectacular as the titular character itself while sound is easily the movie's most impressive aspect. Editing, however, isn't up to the mark but the background score by Alexandre Desplat is just the way it should be in this movie; majestic, imposing & grandeur.Coming to the performances, Godzilla features an unusual cast in Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins & others. And I've no idea what the hell they signed up for because acting certainly isn't what they do here. For the majority of its runtime, all they do is simply stare with their blank faces & dropped jaws and are completely clueless about what's expected from their characters. The only exception is Bryan Cranston who delivers an energetic performance but then his role is short-lived.This movie promised to bring the 'King of the Monsters' right from its origins while also keeping its look & style faithful to its depiction in the original Japanese film. And to that, it delivers. Apart from few modifications, the overall appearance of Godzilla is mostly in tune with its iconic look plus its distinctive roar & signature weapon are also in tact. Still, its role is reduced to an extended cameo as the 1st half doesn't tease us with Godzilla's presence but this giant monster is virtually absent from the scene. And when it finally shows up, it happens simply out of nowhere.On an overall scale, Gareth Edwards' Godzilla had the potential to be 'The Movie of the Summer' but thanks to its mediocre direction, uninspired screenplay, terrible characterization, dull performances, messed-up editing & lack of substance, it doesn't live up to its hype. Still, what works ends up working pretty well in here & considering today's mainstream audience's taste in films, most of them are gonna come out pretty satisfied in the end anyway. To summarize the movie in a sentence, Godzilla did rise but it didn't rise enough.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,3,11,24 May 2014

Casino," A Tale Of Money, Power, Greed, Deception & Murder
","The last collaboration between director Martin Scorsese & actor Robert De Niro as of today, Casino is a tale of money, power, greed, deception & murder that takes its inspiration from real-life events to paint an interesting portrait of both the glamorous & grisly sides of Las Vegas and is expertly steered by stellar performances from its terrific cast.The story of Casino follows a gambling handicapper who is sent to Las Vegas by the Mafia to oversee their casino operations. When his supervision doubles their profits, they send a mob enforcer who's also his childhood friend to look after him. The plot covers their friendship which turns sour over the years as they compete over a gambling empire.Directed by Martin Scorsese (best known for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull & Goodfellas), the story opens with a bang and comes full circle over the course of its runtime but there is no proper narrative structure to it. We watch people going about their daily business and few people dying, and that's what goes on for 3 hours. But the interest isn't all lost, thanks to Scorsese's fine direction.However, the repetitive nature of it does diminish the earlier excitement and after a while, the only thing that keeps it going and makes sure that the film steers past the finish line are its trio of excellent performances. The 1970s casino ambience comes alive in vivid detail but the story is at its most gripping when depicting the other side of Las Vegas that's violent, merciless & uncompromising.Coming to the performances, the film reunites Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci yet again and while the two play their respective roles with comfort & confidence as expected, it's Sharon Stone who steals the show with her at times broken, other times volcanic rendition of the avaricious character. We may not like the characters this film has in store but there's no denying the performances from the cast is absolutely top-notch.On an overall scale, Casino is another fascinating crime epic from Martin Scorsese that recreates the 1970s casino scene in splendid detail and presents its cast at the top of their game but just like most of his other works with De Niro, it's a picture that I admire more than I love. A three-sided character study that takes its trio to the top, only to throw them off the summit, Casino isn't going to be a smooth ride if you can't handle lengthy narratives or don't have the stomach for strong, intense violence.",Null,2,3,20 September 2018
Life," Alien + Gravity - Everything That Made Them Great = Life
","There isn't much wrong with what Life aspires to be. It borrows an already existing template to tread a well-worn path, features a clichéd set of characters with base-level characterizations, makes fine use of tension & suspense, unfolds at a consistent pace throughout its runtime, and manages to be quite engaging despite its highly predictable storyline. But it's far from a great film.The story of Life follows a six-member crew aboard the International Space Station who intercept a space probe returning from Mars with soil samples that could provide the first ever evidence of life beyond Earth. On studying the sample, they discover a dormant single-celled life form that quickly evolves into a multi-celled organism and proves to be far more intelligent than they anticipated.Directed by Daniel Espinosa, Life brings nothing new to the screen and is derived from numerous existing & much superior examples. The movie's plot outline is lifted from Ridley Scott's Alien, its camera-work is inspired from Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, and the scripted people inhabiting its tale are a result of a lack of imagination. Espinosa's direction is good, for he manages to make its dull plot at least a bit interesting.Its poorly written screenplay uses the hackneyed formula for the plot and doesn't even attempt to add something that would make its characters compelling on some level. They are supposed to be astronauts yet the stupid decisions they keep making throughout the movie is astonishing. It's just Rebecca Ferguson's character who showcases some sort of common sense while the remaining crew is too bland to be worthy of any emotional investment.The technical aspects are well executed. Production design team recreates the International Space Station in splendid detail and the zero gravity ambiance is convincingly portrayed. Cinematography makes fab use of the camera, opening with a long, unbroken & single-take scene and encapsulates the whole picture with a claustrophobic aura. Editing provides a steady pace and keeps everything firmly stacked, and its intermittently rousing score has an overpowering feel to it.Coming to the performances, Life features a star-studded cast in Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson, Hiroyuki Sanada, Ariyon Bakare & Olga Dihovichnaya amongst whom Ferguson manages to impress, that too in bits n pieces. Gyllenhaal could've done a lot more had there been more meat on his character's arc. Reynolds is there to play himself and does it without hassle. But the alien happens to exhibit more attributes than all the humans present at ISS combined.On an overall scale, Life is marred by numerous shortcomings and is severely lacking in originality but it still makes up for an adequate sci-fi horror that's quite enjoyable & moderately entertaining. The available resources are expertly utilized by Espinosa, the thrilling moments keep surfacing at regular intervals, and it is well aware of its limitations but there was still room for improvement, for the movie never really takes advantage of its R-rating, is filled with cringeworthy dialogues, and wraps itself up with an ending that it thinks is clever but is actually as trite as it is irrelevant.",Null,2,7,4 April 2017
Heat," Michael Mann's Magnum Opus
","Bringing two icons of yesteryears face to face in a deftly scripted & expertly directed crime drama, Michael Mann's Heat is a defining work of its genre that's envisioned, executed & presented with finesse, is led by compelling performances from both Al Pacino & Robert De Niro and, despite its daunting 3 hours runtime, it manages to be a thoroughly engrossing cinema that's as smart as it is satisfying.The story of Heat follows a career criminal whose latest heist mission goes wrong when his team's hired help impulsively kills an unarmed guard, thus turning their planned robbery into a homicide, and brings veteran LAPD Lieutenant & his crew into the picture who then take over the case and hunt for the perpetrators. What unfolds next is a series of close encounters where each team tries to outdo each other.Written, produced & directed by Michael Mann, the film opens with a thrilling segment that sets up the premise and puts the story into motion. Mann's direction is absolutely top-notch, for he offers ample screen time to all the characters that inhabit this tale, and his script is just as accomplished as every character is embedded with a well-defined arc and the consistent flow between its events keeps the interest alive & kicking.From the technical standpoint, Heat is a masterwork of first-rate craftsmanship as almost all the element work in tandem with the rest to significantly uplift the whole look & feel of the story. The decision to shoot everything on location gives it a realistic vibe, Camera-work is controlled and its handling is smooth & flexible in both close-up & wide panning. Editing moves the plot forward at a steady pace while Sound is skilfully utilised.Coming to the performances, Heat features a fabulous ensemble in Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ted Levine, Tom Noonan, Natalie Portman etc, and although the supporting cast plays their part well, all of them are overshadowed by the stellar inputs of Pacino & De Niro, and the moments between the two are the highlights of this feature. Pacino definitely has the upper hand here but De Niro isn't far behind.However, despite plethora of positives, Heat isn't without its shortcomings. Its 170 minutes runtime carries a lot of fat and could've been trimmed into a lean narrative by editing out nearly everything that doesn't play a key role in the final outcome. The numerous subplots dealing with the turmoil of our relevant characters' personal lives do help in adding more depth to their arcs but most of them are unnecessary and should've ended up on the editing room floor.On an overall scale, Heat scores high marks in both storytelling & technical departments, and has played an influential role in the world of filmmaking over the years. The magnetic screen presence of Al Pacino & Robert De Niro as well as their strong chemistry alone makes it worth a watch but it is Michael Mann who cements his own legacy with this crime drama, for Heat is one of his finest directional efforts, if not the finest, and presents the notable filmmaker in complete control of his craft.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Cinematic Feat Of Imagination, Vision & Creativity That Hypnotized An Entire Generation!
","This is the film that started it all. The first instalment in the Star Wars saga that would later go on to revolutionise its genre, change the landscape blockbuster filmmaking & become a cultural phenomenon, Star Wars (also known as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) is a cinematic feat of imagination, vision & creativity that hypnotized an entire generation with its freshly envisioned & awe-inspiring world, first-rate adventure, interesting characters, state-of-the-art visuals & an epic soundtrack.Having no nostalgic relation whatsoever with this epic space opera, all I can say is that my first stint with Star Wars didn't go as well as I anticipated. Where others heaped praise upon its visual effects, set pieces & other stuff, I found it to be a picture that wasn't just awfully dated but also terribly juvenile, filled with cartoonish creatures, unintentionally hilarious & pretty mediocre in all departments. The ingredients that made it a revolution of its time are visible beneath its degraded visuals but it's not as timeless as they say it is.Set in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars finds the galaxy in a state of civil war for a conflict brews between the Galactic Empire & the Rebel Alliance. The plot focuses on Luke Skywalker, a young boy on a desert planet who inadvertently acquires a pair of droids that possess vital information from Princess Leia regarding the Empire's latest weapon plus her request for help, following which he joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a couple of smugglers & his two droids to rescue the princess from the evil Darth Vader and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyranny.Written & directed by George Lucas, Star Wars is his pet project that permanently engraved his name in the annals of cinema and later spawned a franchise that would go on to redefine epic filmmaking. What's commendable is the mythology Lucas created from the scratch, taking inspirations from different sources but adding an original touch to it. The movie features a simple good vs evil storyline, but what elevates it above mediocrity is its then-sweeping special effects, innovative filmmaking techniques, fascinating set pieces, stunning score, few excellent characterisations & a sense of something new yet familiar.Considering the time it was released, Production design team makes efficient use of its limited budget to come up with wonderfully detailed set pieces, the stupid-looking aliens are brought to life with puppetry or whatever means was available back then, Cinematography exhibits some inventiveness which is quite evident from the first frame. Visual effects was groundbreaking in the 1970s but has severely degraded over the years and looks very cartoonish nowadays. Editing provides a consistent pace & fine flow to its narrative but its 121 minutes can become suffocating if you're not intrigued by its fantasy world.And then there is John Williams who contributes with an iconic score that evokes a sense of epicness at all times plus his soundtrack comprises of tracks that beautifully compliment the story's adventurous ambiance. Coming to the performances, Star Wars is notable for launching the acting career of many and features quite an ensemble in Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness & others who chip in with fine inputs in their given roles. Although nearly all the characters present in this film became part of the modern culture, Darth Vader is the only one that was impressive in my opinion, plus James Earl Jones' voice did add an intimidating quality to him.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope may not look as dazzling & revolutionary today as it was during its time of release but its influence on later sci-fi space operas & other films cannot be understated. For me, this was more or less disappointing for its severely outdated visual encapsulation never allowed me to take any of the unfolding events seriously and for the most part, it was downright laughable. It may have evoked an entirely different reaction from me if I had seen it at least 15 years ago but as of now, even though the effect of Star Wars on its genre, blockbusters & film marketing can still be felt, I feel no love for the saga that many happen to be so crazy about.",Null,3,3,19 January 2016
50_50," Worth Your Time. Worth Your Money. A Surprisingly Good Film.
","Nicely scripted, hugely improvised & emotionally investing, the story of 50/50 is actually based on this film's writer, Will Reiser, who penned down the screenplay covering his own struggle with cancer & ends up making a satire out of it without really hurting the sentiments of anyone undergoing through the same diagnosis in their lives.50/50 concerns Adam; a 27-year old guy who learns that he's diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer & that his chances of survival is 50%. The plot covers his subsequent struggle to beat the disease but in the process, he is finally able to see who & what are the most important things in his life.Wonderfully directed by Jonathan Levine, the film deals with its sensitive subject in a real mature manner without hiding the pitiful sympathies these diagnosed patients receive from everyone at home or work, most of whom don't even really give a shite about what happens to you & simply pretend to care.Adam is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt & his performance is really good. He carries off his character pretty well & nicely captures the experience of unexpected shock after finding out about the disease, the nervousness & fear of living with it, the change an event like this brings in life and the everyday struggle & frustration that comes along when you know that your days are numbered.Yet, the biggest contribution comes from Seth Rogen in the role of Kyle; Adam's best friend who tries everything to prevent Adam from breaking down, is always there to cheer him up & treats him as if nothing major has happened. The rest of the supporting cast also chip in with fine performances & leaves nothing major to complain.On an overall scale, 50/50 isn't a depressing cinematic experience but an enjoyable one which makes excellent use of humour from start to finish to keep the whole drama a lighthearted affair despite dealing with a serious illness & truly succeeds in accomplishing what it set out to do. Worth your time. Worth your money. Don't miss it.",Null,0,0,24 December 2011

Deadpool," Merc With A Mouth Comes To Cinematic Life In Unrestrained, Unadulterated & Undiluted Form
","Starring God's perfect idiot in the role he was born to play, jam-packed with R-rated naughtiness from beginning to end, and riding high on the strength of its raunchy humour, self-referential winks & pop culture references, Deadpool tells the story of the odd, unpredictable, loud-mouthed, sarcastic & delightfully deranged antihero in an unabashedly freewheeling manner, is continually refreshing on more levels than one, and is the funniest superhero flick to surface on the silver screen since Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. But I can't help but feel slightly dissatisfied, for this film could have been so much more than what it settles for in the final print.The story of Deadpool follows Wade Wilson, a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary whose plan of settling down and spending the rest of his life with the girl he loves goes outside the window when he learns that he has terminal cancer. After being approached by a mysterious recruiter who offers a cure to his diagnosis, he takes part in a human experimentation program that bestows him with accelerated healing capabilities but also leaves him severely disfigured. Managing to survive the ordeal, Wilson adopts the persona of a masked vigilante and, with his self- healing powers & twisted sense of humour, starts looking for the people who nearly destroyed his life.Directed by an overpaid tool in what is actually his directional debut, the film's wicked opening credits clearly indicate the kind of movie it aspires to be, and then follows it up with an ingeniously choreographed, gleefully violent & exuberantly witted first act that also turns out to be its self- defeating moment, for the film is never able to attain that same height again for the remainder of its runtime. Tim Miller's direction is quite impressive for a first feature but his inexperience also shows up when he allows the film to go into the overkill mode, and is clueless about when & where to draw the line. And although the story hurls one witty line after another, not all of them work out in the film's favour.The first act introduces the eponymous character to the audience in flamboyant style and effectively establishes his origins, eccentric wit & modus operandi but the rest of the narrative is simply a downhill journey. The writers stay faithful to the sardonic tone of its source material, the screenplay brims with playful, profane & parodic remarks, there is sufficient meat on the titular character's arc, and it follows an interesting trajectory as well but its middle & final acts fail to duplicate the effervescent zest of its opening segment and apart from Deadpool, there are no compelling characters in the movie. Many of its one-liners are hilarious & inventive, but a few of them become repetitive & wearisome after a while.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Ryan Reynolds, a hot chick, a British villain, the comic relief, the moody teen & a CGI character, with only Reynolds leaving a lasting impression. Reynolds' rendition of Wade Wilson both in & out of the suit makes it one of those perfect actor-character marriages, and it is actually difficult to imagine someone else playing this role with such remarkable finesse. Morena Baccarin & T.J. Miller play Wilson's girlfriend & best friend, respectively, and are runners-up in the acting department but their work is still no match to Reynold's input, for the latter carries the entire film on his own. Ed Skrein does well with what he's given, while the character of Colossus is plainly annoying.On an overall scale, Deadpool is an endlessly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining & downright rambunctious roller-coaster ride that delivers on its promise of bringing the 'Merc with a Mouth' to cinematic life in his unrestrained, unadulterated & undiluted form, makes blatant use of adult humour throughout its runtime, and even manages to subvert the superhero formula to an extent. But its attempt to defy the norm & follow an unorthodox route only happens on a superficial level, for beneath its surface lies the same predictable & formulaic narrative that we've seen many times before. Opening on an extremely promising note but losing its way in the middle, Deadpool works only because of Ryan Reynolds' swashbuckling, show-stealing & effortlessly charismatic performance and while it had the ingredients to separate itself from the pack, it isn't as unconventional as it appears to be.",Null,1,9,30 April 2016
Cloud Atlas," Unnecessarily Added Complexity To An Already Complex Plot.
","Presented in large numbers of fragments which viewers are left to connect all by themselves, Cloud Atlas is without a doubt a very thoughtful, highly ambitious & deeply philosophical project from Tom Tykwer (director of Run Lola Run) & Wachowski Brothers (the creators of The Matrix Trilogy) but there's also no denying that it is way too overlong, very complex & not as immersive as was expected from it.The movie features a complex, non-chronological plot structure that is narrated in fragmented segments, is supported by terrific visuals, dazzling cinematography, good performances, stunning make-up & amazing soundtrack and also covers many themes n elements of love, loss, betrayal, trust & spirituality throughout its runtime. But on an overall scale, this flick is a thought-provoking work that is destined to polarise its viewers.As for me, Cloud Atlas had the scope to be one of the finest sci-fi films of recent years but it simply fails to hold up due to its sheer size & unnecessarily added complications to an already complex plot. Maybe another viewing in the future might change my opinion about it by some degree but for now, this sci-fi drama remains a major disappointment. Multiple viewings advised.",Null,1,5,11 October 2013

Kingsman: The Secret Service," Does To James Bond What Kickass Did To Superheroes!
","From the director of Kickass & X-Men: First Class comes a new comic book adaptation that effortlessly blends the over-the-top action of the former with the secret world of the latter, which is then smoothly intermixed with elements of spy-thrillers & is ultimately raised to a high level of bizarro. And the result is an incredibly stylish, downright hilarious & endlessly fun cinema called Kingsman: The Secret Service.Based on the acclaimed comic book, Kingsman: The Secret Service refers to a secret spy organisation that's looking to recruit a potential agent as a replacement for the position left vacated by a former Kingsman who dies during one of their operations. The story follows a veteran Kingsman agent who takes an aimless young adult under his wing & grooms him for the job while a twisted billionaire unleashes a global threat.Co-written, co-produced & directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose kinetic direction here brims with creative energy as his latest is his love letter to earlier James Bond classics. However, it also toys with the conventions of its genre & makes fun of the same simultaneously, and with its clever use of violence, outlandish humour & a few cartoonish renderings, makes this film a roller-coaster ride of emotions.Coming to the technical aspects, Production Design team does an excellent job as all the set pieces are meticulously refined. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera that seamlessly switches from a firmly controlled sequence to an out-of-control carnage without ever losing focus. Editing briskly paces the whole narrative. Plus, the energetic soundtrack by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson works in the film's favour.As far as performances go, Kingsman: The Secret Service features a well-rounded cast in Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong, Taron Egerton & others. Now Firth may not be anyone's first choice for an action role yet it's the exact reason why his character works so well. Jackson is funny & freaky at the same time. Strong is reliable as always. Egerton is the newcomer here who exhibits great potential & his master-disciple relationship with Firth is a highlight of this feature.On an overall scale, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an early oddball of the year that does to James Bond what Kickass did to superheroes. Its unexpected shift in tones, crazy action sequences & eccentric use of humour may not go well with everyone but even its detractors can't deny the awesomeness of the church scene. While certainly a no match to Vaughn's previous effort, this British spy action comedy is nevertheless an enjoyable, entertaining & amusing ride that comes gleefully recommended.",Null,3,8,29 May 2015
Ran," An Ambitious Showcase Of Power, Greed, Betrayal, Retribution & Insanity
","A period epic brought to life in exhausting detail, Akira Kurosawa's Ran is a splendidly crafted tale of power, corruption, treachery, vengeance & insanity and is efficiently realised on the film canvas with its meticulous set pieces, sweeping camera-work & committed performances but its overlong runtime & glacial pace may not go well with everyone.The story of Ran follows a powerful but elderly warlord who hands over his vast empire to his three sons after choosing to retire. Expecting his sons to maintain harmony amongst themselves & keep the kingdom united, he vastly underestimates the corrupting nature of power he had just bestowed upon them and haplessly watches them turn on each other as well as him.Co-written, edited & directed by Akira Kurosawa, Ran is an ambitious production by all means and Kurosawa leaves no stone unturned to recreate the era his narrative is set in. Making effective use of colour palette, long-shot photography, vast landscapes, period-specific costumes & extensive list of extras, it delivers as an epic but what benefits it most is the strong foundation in the script.Despite all the chaos brewing in the kingdom, Ran is mainly about the downfall of a once mighty king and covers his descent into madness. Taking inspiration from Shakespeare's play, it weaves an original storyline that's quite interesting and its central character's arc is just as compelling but the slow pace at which its plot unfurls and the many meanderings in the middle does make it a difficult sit at times.Coming to the acting department, the entire cast delivers sincere performances and play their part responsibly, with Tatsuya Nakadai impressing the most as the elderly warlord in what's a powerfully gripping & highly expressive rendering that nearly overshadows the input of the rest of the actors. Also worthy of mention is its background score that brims with a haunting vibe and aptly captures the film's somber mood.On an overall scale, Ran is a competently directed, deftly written, expertly layered, elegantly shot & brilliantly performed cinema that does many things right over the course of its 162 mins runtime but is still not without its shortcomings. There are moments in it that linger on for too long and the dull pace, even if it is deliberate, doesn't help its cause either. All in all, Akira Kurosawa's last epic is an ambitious showcase of power & madness but it isn't as rewarding as I expected it to be.",Null,0,1,29 September 2017

The performances by the cast is truly amateur, but the setting and filmmaking is pure craft.Putting up six different people from different backgrounds inside a cubic structure, the movie creates a tense atmosphere of claustrophobia, thrill & suspense throughout its runtime and ends as mysteriously as it began. A pure surprise of exciting suspense and mystery blended with a cleverly twisted plot, Cube is destined to please the fans of its genre.",Null,0,3,9 August 2013
Fast Five," The Finest Chapter Of The Fast And The Furious Series, By Far.
","The fifth instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast Five is an intensely gripping, thoroughly engaging & relentlessly entertaining sequel that not just brings several upgrades in all departments of filmmaking but by replacing the street racing formula with elements of a heist thriller, it ends up resurrecting this derailed franchise in style and heralds the series' heading into a new direction.Set in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the story of Fast Five follows Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner & Mia as they plan a massive heist to steal $100 million in cash from a ruthless drug lord & corrupt businessman and enlist the help of former allies to pull off the job which would buy them their freedom. But at the same time, they find themselves being pursued by a federal agent who's in Rio to arrest both Dom & Brian.Directed by Justin Lin, Fast Five presents the director in splendid form as his kinetic work behind the camera keeps its story running on top-gear from start to finish, and the earlier momentum it gained with its explosive opening sequence is never lost. The screenplay at last places more emphasis on its story & characters, adds in a welcome amount of humour and even though the route it takes is new, the old-school formula isn't entirely discarded.The technical aspects exhibit a complete overhaul which is in sync with the transformation this franchise itself undergoes through this chapter. Production design team puts up some wonderfully detailed set pieces, Cinematography makes exuberant use of its camera while the applied colour tones are more vivid than before. The plot unfolds at breakneck pace & Editing is at its best during the action sequences, and the vehicular carnage it has in store is simply overwhelming.Coming to the performances, Fast Five brings the notable characters from all the previous chapters together under one roof and all of them deliver more confident performances. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker show greater maturity in their respective roles of Dom & Brian but it's the swashbuckling input from Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson that turns out to be the biggest surprise of them all. It's not difficult to assess that he was really enjoying his character and it reflects in his impressive performance.Last but not the least is Brian Tyler's score which packs in some intense, vibrant tracks that never allows the film's charged atmosphere to settle down and actually enhances the whole experience by a considerable margin. The visual effects team also brings its A-game for the moments of action seem convincing for the most part, even if it's a tad over the top. There are more thrilling moments to be found here than in all previous chapters combined and all moments featuring Johnson & Diesel together are a highlight, right away.On an overall scale, Fast Five is without a shadow of a doubt the finest chapter in The Fast and the Furious franchise and the first one in the series that manages to find a near-perfect balance between its elements of style & substance. High-octane, full-throttled & immensely satisfying, Fast Five is an action-packed roller-coasted ride that packs in all the ingredients in just the right dosages to succeed as a genuine summer blockbuster material & a quality entertainer for not just the fans of the series, but newcomers as well. Absolutely worth your time & money.",Null,2,3,4 September 2015
The Thin Red Line," Everyone Sees Their Own Versions of The Thin Red Line.
","The year that was dominated by Steven Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic, highly intense & genre-defining cinema called Saving Private Ryan also saw the release of another war film from a notable filmmaker who returned to film directing after 20 years of absence. Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line may not be as graphic a depiction of war & its brutality as Spielberg's masterpiece but the manner in which it approaches its genre is far more philosophical than other films dealing with this subject usually dare to.The Thin Red Line isn't just about war but the fear & moral complications a soldier faces in the battlefield and the film as a whole is a deeper study of war's devastating effects on not only human soul but nature as well. Loosely based on the novel of the same name, it is a fictionalized depiction of the Battle of Mount Austen on Guadalcanal between the American & Japanese soldiers during the Second World War and is told from the viewpoint of five major characters.The direction by Terrence Malick wonderfully contrasts the ugliness of war with the beauty of nature plus the surreal imagery, visual poetry & symbolism it presents is nicely fused into its narrative. The screenplay features less dialogues related to the plot & asks more philosophical questions that aren't easy to answer. Cinematography is absolutely dazzling for there is beauty in every single frame of the film. And Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely heart-warming.Coming to the performances, The Thin Red Line boasts an impressive cast in Jim Cavaziel, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin & many more amongst which Cavaziel impresses the most and is the heart & soul of this film. But what still turned this film into a slight disappointment for me is its confusing plot as it's really not easy to figure out what exactly this film is about & ends up being too high-minded for everyone's taste.On an overall scale, The Thin Red Line is an intricate human drama set in the backdrop of a war which provides Terrence Malick an ideal environment to skilfully explore the themes of fear of death, detachment from reality & search for wisdom that deserves to be seen by admirers of Malick as well as die-hard fans of art-house cinema. Worth a watch? Certainly. It's a Terrence Malick film after all.",Null,3,4,7 December 2013
Green Book," Undeniably Flawed Yet Sufficiently Entertaining
","Another example in the long list of films that provide an overly simplistic view of race relations in America, Green Book is a sincerely crafted & aptly narrated cross-country ride that's steered by some fresh bantering between its two leads but it is also outdated in its approach, and brings nothing new to the table.Set in the American South during the 1960s, the story follows an Italian-American bouncer who takes the job of driving & bodyguarding an African-American pianist on a musical tour through Southern states. The title refers to the travel guide that was in circulation for safe travel through the country's racial segregation.Directed by Peter Farrelly, the execution is pretty straightforward and though the film adds nothing to the race discussions, the friendship angle is treated with care & compassion and is allowed to develop gradually. The story is told through Tony Lip's viewpoint and is about the change the journey brings in his personality.Both Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali play their roles convincingly, especially the latter whose suave & sophisticated rendering of Don Shirley turns out to be one definite highlight of this film. But it's their clashing attitudes to life & ideals that gives this film its finest moments while their quips retain its playful quality throughout.On an overall scale, Green Book doesn't delve deep into the still prevalent racial situation in America but as a tale of friendship, growth & understanding, it does what it set out to do. A mostly lighthearted story that's driven home by splendid performances from Mortensen & Ali, Green Book is undeniably flawed but most viewers will still come out entertained & satisfied with what it has to offer.",Null,6,11,5 January 2019
Da 5 Bloods," 'Treasure Of Sierra Madre' Meets 'Apocalypse Now' In This Latest Spike Lee Joint
","The Treasure of the Sierra Madre meets Apocalypse Now in this latest Spike Lee joint. Da 5 Bloods is an attempt to capture the African-American experience in an immoral war they were funnelled into despite a larger crisis brewing at home and argues that unlike their harrowing time in Vietnam, their battle for survival in their own country is still raging and is far from over.Directed by Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing & BlacKkKlansman), the opening scene slaps the viewers with the horror America has caused over the years, both inside & outside its borders, and aptly portrays the scars & remnants of Vietnam experience they and the natives never recovered from. The film is gripping & interesting for the most part but not all its moments hit the sweet spot.The first action segment is diluted by a score that doesn't fit at all. The monologues are more or less ineffective & unnecessary. The change in aspect ratio is smooth & productive and the fluid camerawork & rich colour grading add more vibrance to the imagery. Performances from the entire cast is top-notch, the group dynamic exhibits a sense of unity & brotherhood, and Delroy Lindo easily stands out.Overall, Da 5 Bloods is crafted with vigour, told with intensity, and expertly merges the politics of then with now to point out the African-American struggle that's been ongoing since forever. A tension-fuelled & emotionally charged cinematic ride that intertwines social commentary with genre thrills, Da 5 Bloods is as relevant as it is timely and although erratic & messy at times, it is amongst the better films of 2020.",Null,3,7,15 June 2020
The Great Escape," Expected A More Engaging Drama
","An adventurous, light-hearted story set in a Nazi POW camp during the Second World War, The Great Escape is a finely crafted, patiently narrated & ably performed cinema that today is hailed as a classic example of its genre by viewers & critics alike but all I found is a film that ends up running far too longer than it's supposed to.Inspired from a true incident, The Great Escape tells the story of the Allied prisoners of war who have been recaptured by the Nazi German forces & are placed in a high-security POW camp where they together decide to plan a mass escape. But with jailers keeping a close watch, they have to be extra-careful so as to not give away any suspicions.Directed by John Sturges, the film marks my first stint with his works and also happens to be the first film starring Steve McQueen that I've seen. The story does have moments that impress in bits n pieces but it fails to justify its 165 minutes of runtime. Cinematography is pretty ordinary, Editing is nearly absent & the soundtrack brings an adventurous vibe to it.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson & others, and it's actually their contribution that makes it a cinema worth sitting through. McQueen is definitely the coolest of the bunch, Attenborough also manages to leave a lasting impression, Garner has his moments to shine & they all are nicely supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, The Great Escape is neither a great cinema nor a bad one but considering its legacy, it did leave me disappointed, possibly due to my high expectations. The whole picture is filled with moments of action, adventure, comedy, drama & suspense plus the thoroughly filmed escape sequence & the following events are a delight to watch, yet I was hoping for a more engaging experience which it failed to deliver.",Null,1,3,15 June 2015

Jackie Brown," Not Bad At All But Not As Magical As Quentin Tarantino's Finest Works Either
","The third feature film by Quentin Tarantino is also his first to be adapted from a pre-existing material instead of his self-written screenplay, and while it manages to work as his homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, Jackie Brown unfortunately lacks the flamboyance & kinetic wit of Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction and is one of Tarantino's less impressive works.The story of Jackie Brown is set in Los Angeles & follows its titular character, a middle-aged woman who works as a flight attendant for a small Mexican airline and earns a little extra by smuggling money for an arms dealer. Caught in the act by federal agents, she refuses to cut any deal with them and instead concocts a devious plan to get away from the mess she put herself in.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Jackie Brown carries an entirely different feel when compared to his earlier works and isn't as stylish & fancy as one expects a Tarantino film to be. The story is character driven but the scripted characters themselves lack an interesting dimension. Nevertheless, the plot is consistently moving, the twists are expertly executed & it is entertaining for the most part.Coming to the performances, Jackie Brown features a wonderful cast in Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda & Robert De Niro, with Grier & Forster impressing the most in what turned out to be a career-resurrecting work for both of them plus their chemistry is pretty much on the spot as well. Jackson dominates the screen with another terrific performance while De Niro is a natural in the role of a bum.On an overall scale, Jackie Brown takes a slightly conventional route with its storytelling, is crafted in a restrained manner, and although it packs in usual Tarantino's trademarks, much of its presence is low-key in comparison to his past works. Lacking the charisma, vibrance plus his patented blend of violence & humour yet offering a solid thriller that works far better when accepted as a separate entity from Tarantino's then-established forte, Jackie Brown isn't disappointing but it isn't as magical as his best works either.",Null,1,2,21 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Sequel That Raised The Bar For Sequels, The Empire Strikes Back Is The Finest Episode Of Star Wars Saga
","One of the most celebrated film sequels of all time, Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back is the follow-up chapter to George Lucas' revolutionary Star Wars that happens to be both notorious & influential for its much darker ambiance in comparison to the adventurous tone of the original. Regarded by many as the best chapter of the whole saga and memorable for its unforgettable final twist that no one saw coming, The Empire Strikes Back does feature a more involving storyline but thanks to its marred visuals, this was just as difficult to take seriously as its predecessor.Set three years after the events of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back continues the story of Luke Skywalker who travels to a desolate planet to study the Force & receive advanced Jedi training from Jedi Master Yoda. Meanwhile, the Galactic Empire makes a vicious comeback against the Rebel Alliance, overpowering & driving the rebel forces from their base. Darth Vader becomes obsessed with finding Luke & pursues his friends in order to capture him. In the end, the decision rests with Luke who can either choose to complete his training or confront the Sith Lord & save his friends.Directed by Irvin Kershner, who adapts the storyline that was conceived by George Lucas, The Empire Strikes Back brims with a darker, sinister mood that encapsulates the whole picture from the start. Kershner's direction is laudable for he does a brilliant job in putting up a narrative that's just as effective as its predecessor, and then some more. The screenplay steps away from a number of conventions, defies expectations at every corner, and commences the trend of film sequels heading into a darker territory which, even after 35 years, happens to be quite prevalent in the motion picture industry.Production design team makes sufficient use of its bigger budget to put on screen some more elaborate set pieces. Cinematography makes greater use of its colour palette & precision lighting to capture every event in splendid detail. The visual effects are slightly more refined even if the entire visual encapsulation has deteriorated over the years and looks outdated. Editing is more improved and its 124 minutes of runtime is steadily paced. And last but not the least, John Williams delivers yet another epic, enthralling & pulsating score that feels more evolved than last time and seamlessly integrates into the narrative.Coming to the performances, The Empire Strikes Back presents Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, David Prowse, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker & others reprising their roles from the previous feature, while new additions include Billy Dee Williams & Frank Oz. The arc of every character continues to develop plus various relationships & conflicts are introduced or established with the actors doing an adequate job with what they're given. Darth Vader once again turns out to be the main highlight and is even more intimidating than before while the rest of the cast exhibit more comfort in their respective roles.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back is a successful follow-up chapter that raised the bar for both sequels & its genre at its time of release and remains an important entity of modern pop culture. The absence of any nostalgic attachment to this franchise as well as its dated visuals once again result in an average film experience for me but I did have more fun with this instalment than the one that preceded it. Changing the entire tone of the series & taking its saga to a wholly different level with its unforeseen cliffhanger, The Empire Strikes Back further solidifies the legacy of its franchise, is just as influential as its predecessor, and is still capable of surprising the newcomers.",Null,1,2,20 January 2016
Minions," Minion Madness Has Never Been This Unbearable!
","I had a hunch that I wasn't going to like it but wow, I should not have seen this! This is one of those unforgettable atrocities that absolutely make you despite the very things you once found adorable and although it's quite evident that this stupid vile piece of crap is aimed at kids, does it really have to be this pathetic for the rest of the viewers who were left with no choice but to accompany those little rascals & sit through this unbearable torture?A spin-off to the Despicable Me series that also serves as a prequel, Minions tells the story of its titular characters; the small, yellow henchmen of Gru who have been around since the very beginning and have served the most despicable of masters throughout their existence. The plot follows three of them who, in order to find their group a new master, venture out of their isolation and into Orlando where they meet the world's first female supervillain at the Villain-Con.Written by Brian Lynch and directed by Kyle Balda & Pierre Coffin, Minions neither features a script nor any sort of direction for it is one of the dumbest productions ever green-lighted by any studio. From the very opening scene when these minions accompany the Universal logo, you can feel your intuition telling you to walk out. But the level of annoyance & highly off-putting human characters that inhabit this turd turn it into an experience that many will regret for the rest of their lives.Although minion madness was a surprise delight in Despicable Me, it worked because they were effectively used to support the relevant characters. Despicable Me 2 did upgrade their time on screen & was a laughter riot in a way but it also exhibited inferiority in story quality when compared to its predecessor. But to allocate an entire picture based on these yellow little bastards is a huge mistake for it simply kills the fun by overdoing it and with no story or character development, it's just not worth it.And yet the worst thing about Minions isn't the minions but the extremely forced & childish attempts at humour as well as the few human characters that are penned into the storyline. The gibberish insanity becomes dull sooner than expected, the narration that accompanies the plot was unnecessary, the villain is one of the worst ever imaginable, it feel too long for a 90 minutes movie, animation isn't much of an issue but everything around it is, and from start to finish, it's filled with nothing but one terrible scene after another.On an overall scale, Minions is an uninspiring, unnecessary & mind-numbingly awful movie that not only goes down as one of the worst films of the year but is also amongst the worst films ever made. There are a couple of amusing moments but for the most part, this movie is a ghastly, repulsive & all-out flat experience that's capable of totally destroying your love for the little yellow freaks, if there was any. Too much of a good thing can have devastating consequences and Minions is definitely a strong testament to that. Skip it or suffer.",Null,2,2,24 November 2015
Aladdin," Arabian Nights
","Aladdin is one character I've grown up watching & enjoying when its TV show used to air and it was one of my favourite cartoon series. But only later did I find out that it was the feature film from Disney that started it all. So, there's no doubt that I approached the film with high expectations & yet it managed to deliver on such excellence note that it was a straight shot into my favourite animation films & is one of the finest features to come out from the Disney Renaissance Era.Set in a fictional sultanate of Agrabah, the film tells the story of Aladdin; a street urchin making his living by stealing foods with his pet monkey named Abu. One day, he accidentally bumps into Princess Jasmine who's disguised as a local civilian, the two fall in love but Jasmine can only marry a prince according to the law. Aladdin soon finds himself arrested & involved in Jafar's (Sultan's attorney) evil plan to retrieve an ancient mysterious oil lamp but the plan goes for a toss when Aladdin unravels the secret about the lamp earlier.The entire sultanate of Agrabah is beautifully drawn & it looks gorgeous on screen. Every character is wonderfully fleshed out from Aladdin, Jasmine, Abu, Genie, Jafar n others & each one has a vital role to play here but my favourite amongst all was Iago; Jafar's sarcastic, foul- mouthed pet parrot, who was an absolute show-stealer. The beautiful Arabian-themed music & truly enchanting songs also make a strong contribution to the story plus the opening song that commences the film couldn't have done so on a more imposing note.More than 2 decades have passed since Aladdin first came out but it still hasn't aged a day. It remains as fresh as it did the first time I watched it & is as impressive a story as it is nostalgic for me. On an overall scale, Aladdin is one of the finest animation films from Disney that scores high on all filmmaking aspects & is full of interesting, intriguing characters whom you just can't hate. Although I feel that almost everyone has seen it but in case you haven't, then do yourself a favour & go check it out.",Null,1,2,24 April 2014
Incredibles 2," Almost Worth The 14 Years Wait
","Another marvellous entry in Pixar's canon that's fresh, funny & fascinating in more ways than one, Incredibles 2 retains all the stuff that made the original an instant classic right away and though it falls a little short on expectations, it's still more balanced than your average superhero flick. Almost worth the 14-year wait, the latest entry in the Parr family saga somehow manages to live up to its name.",Null,1,4,17 August 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," Inside Llewyn Davis Finds the Coen Brothers in Sublime Form
","Winner of the Grand Prix at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Inside Llewyn Davis finds the Coen brothers in sublime form & puts on screen an aimless journey of a messed up individual navigating through the New York's folk music scene of the early 1960s. The film covers just one week in the life of Llewyn Davis where we see him trying to deal with the increasing pile of obstacles he faces on a daily basis, most of which are of his own making. In short, Inside Llewyn Davis is simply an observation of a reckless individual who refuses to get his life together.In spite of having no definite plot, the Coen brothers somehow manage to make the film work through their remarkable use of dry humour & unconventional narration. The film makes great use of Coens' trademarks, the production design is impressive, cinematography is this film's most striking aspect, editing could've trimmed away some more scenes & the soundtrack introduces some wonderful folk additions performed by the cast themselves.As for the performances, Oscar Isaac delivers a breakthrough performance as Llewyn Davis & it's his brilliant performance only which makes it possible for us to sympathize with the quite unlikable character he plays in this film. Other supporting performances are also good but present in short doses featuring Carey Mulligan as Jean, Justin Timberlake as Jim, John Goodman as Roland Turner; a jazz musician & Garrett Hedlund as Johnny Five. Also making a prominent mark is an orange tabby cat which is a symbolic character in the film.If you're into folk music, then you might find something to like about this film. If you're a fan of the Coen brothers, then you will find something to like about this film. On an overall scale, Inside Llewyn Davis is a tragically funny cinema that explores the bleak disappointments that so many people around the world face at some point of their careers and tries to expose a deeply unsettling truth; It's that even the most talented individuals don't always end up being the successful ones.

Sin City," Something Never Done Before. Something Never Seen Before. Something Never Experience Before.
","Adapting a comic book series on the film canvas is one thing but transitioning it into a live-action motion picture in a manner that it brings the comic book to life in an almost literal sense while mirroring the events of the novel frame to frame is something truly extraordinary. And that's what Sin City is; something never done before, something never seen before & something never experienced before.Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel series of the same name, Sin City is presented in 3 primary chapters (That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye & The Big Fat Kill), each lifted directly from the novel & is presented in a non-linear & overlapping order (unless you're watching the recut, extended & unrated version). A non-related short segment named The Customer Is Always Right also exists but it only serves in bookending the whole narrative.Directed, produced, photographed, edited & scored by Robert Rodriguez, Sin City remains the most accomplished film of his career. Also sharing the direction credit is Frank Miller himself & Quentin Tarantino is in as guest director for filming one scene. Cinematography is jaw-dropping gorgeous n groundbreaking, editing is deftly carried out & music is perfectly suitable. In short, Sin City is a marvel of technical filmmaking & an astonishing work of cinematic art.Featuring an ensemble cast of Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, Jaime King, Alexis Bledel, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Benicio del Toro & many more, everyone delivers a fantastic performance but the standouts for me were Rourke & Wood, both featured in my favourite story of the three; The Hard Goodbye. While Rourke impresses the most as the unstoppable beast, Marv, Elijah followed him closely with his sinister rendition of Kevin; a mute cannibalistic serial killer.Sin City may not be a flawless film on an overall scale but it still remains one of the most stylish, inventive, faithful, original & visually path-breaking films to come out in the 21st century. An extraordinary achievement in genre-filmmaking & a breathtaking cinematic ride from start to finish, this visual extravaganza from Rodriguez & Miller that's no less a cinematic feat is a must for every cinema lover out there. An instant classic. An unforgettable experience. A technical masterpiece.",Null,0,1,22 April 2014
Gangs of New York," Everything About This Film Is Overshadowed By Daniel Day-Lewis' Astonishing Performance
","Beginning the director-actor collaboration between Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio on a promising note, Gangs of New York paints a fascinating portrait of its era and is a meticulously researched period drama but pretty much everything about it is overshadowed by the exceptional performance from Daniel Day-Lewis.Set in mid-19th century New York, the story of Gangs of New York follows an Irish immigrant who witnessed his father being murdered by the leader of an opposing gang as a kid and returns to the place years later to avenge his death. Meanwhile, the forced conscription in the ongoing Civil War ultimately leads to city wide riots.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the 19th century New York comes to cinematic life in splendid detail and is a result of painstaking research & era appropriate set pieces. Scorsese's direction has the drama going up & down throughout its runtime, for many segments are highly engaging while others are poorly handled & tediously paced.Production design team does a spectacular job at transporting the viewers back to its timeline and the entire cityscape has an authentic feel to it. Camera is expertly operated, utilising many of the director's trademarks. The pace only gets worse as plot progresses plus there are many scenes that the film could have done without. And Howard Shore turns in a fitting score.Coming to the performances, Gangs of New York is spearheaded by a memorable showcase from Daniel Day-Lewis whose rendition of Bill the Butcher easily ranks amongst his finest acts. Leonardo DiCaprio also chips in with a strong input in his supporting role and so does the rest of the cast but none of them hold a candle to Day-Lewis magnetic screen presence & sheer commitment to his role.On an overall scale, Gangs of New York nails the period details of its story but the drama isn't entirely compelling and the only aspects that keep it together are its historical depictions & Daniel Day-Lewis' electrifying performance. Opening on a violent, chaotic & instantly gripping note but losing its grasp in the middle, Gangs of New York impresses in bits n pieces but it's nonetheless worth a watch for Day-Lewis' riveting act alone.",Null,2,3,25 March 2018
Gangs of New York," This Epic Belongs To Daniel Day-Lewis More Than Anyone Else.
","Set during the Civil War during the 1860s and telling the gangland history of New York that is a skyline today, Martin Scorsese has crafted Gangs of New York in stunning detail and his direction is as good as the movie along with its impressive art direction, crisp editing & superb cinematography. Amongst the performances, Leonardo DiCaprio was no doubt very good but it's Daniel Day-Lewis who steals the show with his sensational performance as Bill the Butcher, becoming the biggest highlight of this film. Ruthless, electrifying & show-stealing, Daniel Day- Lewis continues to dazzle us in yet another masterclass performance. The ending of the film was a little disappointing from the perspective of how the entire film was setting the ending up to be. Yet, Gangs of New York is one satisfying piece of epic in Scorsese's career.",Null,0,0,14 October 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Fans of Horror Genre Are Gonna Have One Hell of A Time.
","Surfacing as a fresh breathe of life in what is slowly becoming a dying genre with every passing year, The Cabin in the Woods is a smartly crafted satirical horror film that dares to do something different with its genre, is cleverly structured like a jigsaw puzzle that keeps dropping hints every now n then, and succeeds as a quality example of both horror & comedy.The story concerns five teenagers who head off for a weekend at a remote cabin in the woods where they seem to be having a really good time until they discover a cellar door & decide to investigate. Things are set in motion when one of them unwittingly awakens the dead but what they don't know is that all of their actions is being observed by a hidden underground facility.Written by Joss Whedon & Drew Goddard, produced by the former and directed by the latter, the best thing about this film is that it confuses till the very end by twisting & embracing its genre at the same time while carefully blending humour with elements of horror but fanatics of the genre are sure gonna have a great time in working out the countless references this feature makes to the chillers of the past.Very well directed by Goddard in what's his directional debut, superbly written, finely photographed, brilliantly edited, nicely performed & elegantly presented, The Cabin in the Woods is both a homage & satire of its genre that offers a far more enjoyable & entertaining ride than expected. Relatively fun, slightly unsettling & highly amusing from start to finish, this self- parody flick is definitely worth a shot.",Null,0,2,14 October 2013
Spectre," A Moderately Entertaining James Bond Flick That Disappoints As A Sequel To Skyfall
","What made Casino Royale work on so many levels was the fact that it offered an incredibly refreshing take on the iconic character of James Bond and was a welcome departure from the conventions of previous instalments of this long-running franchise. It marked the dawn of a new era of Bond films that was free from the crushing weight of its predecessors and had an opportunity to take the eponymous 007 agent into uncharted realms. And it did.But Quantum of Solace failed to capitalise on the solid platform that was provided to it yet even in its failure, it didn't entirely give in to the established 007 formula. Skyfall was a bit of both; a continuing sequel that added more wings to this reinvented 007 figure while also celebrating the commemoration by homaging the films belonging to the bygone era. It was excusable for taking Bond to his previous roots, considering its timing, but Spectre is not!The 24th instalment in the James Bond film franchise and the 4th to feature Daniel Craig in the iconic role, Spectre is a direct sequel to Skyfall that picks the story right from where the previous chapter signed off. The plot follows Bond who goes rogue to carry out an off-the- books mission in Mexico City, the trail of which leads him to Rome where 007 infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of a global criminal organisation called Spectre.Directed by Sam Mendes, Spectre marks his second stint with a Bond film after Skyfall and whatever little issues that previous film had, is only magnified in this latest entry. The movie begins with an explosive action scene followed by a rather unimpressive theme song & from there on, it's all downhill. It does up the ante in the action segments but the whole absurdity of it that was prevalent in the pre-Craig Bond flicks makes its return while the plot is further marred by its lack of originality, slow pace & overlong story.The technical aspects are finely carried out but it doesn't match the standard set by Skyfall. Set pieces are meticulously designed, wonderfully detailed & visually arresting. The camera is handled by Hoyte van Hoytema who instantly makes his mark with a single unbroken shot that sets up an expertly staged & precisely paced sequence but the shadowy colour palette only turns those images dull & murky. Pacing is a definite issue, VFX & stunts are admirable while Thomas Newman's score contributes with a darker & fitting score.Coming to the acting department, the cast of Daniel Craig, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris & Ralph Fiennes reprise their given roles while the new addition includes Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Monica Bellucci & Dave Bautista and everyone's work is all over the place. Craig does exhibit some signs of fatigue yet he does better than most, Waltz plays the villain but is totally wasted in the role, Seydoux does well with what she's given, Bellucci isn't around for long, Whishaw & Harris have got nothing to add, Fiennes' M is yet to adopt that figure of authority and Bautista is physically intimidating at times.On an overall scale, Spectre works as a moderately entertaining Bond flick, disappoints as a sequel to Skyfall, fails to live up to the hype & expectations despite beginning on such a promising note, and is a very frustrating entry that sticks with the obsolete protocols of the franchise by pointlessly referencing to those previous chapters instead of taking the series & its signature character into unexplored realms. It does have a few positive aspects such as its consistent delivery of action & thrills, those amazing set pieces & a splendid score but the negatives outweighs the positives and thanks to that, Spectre is a forgettable entry that doesn't have much to offer.",Null,2,6,28 November 2015

Joy," A Joyless Experience!
","From the director of The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook & American Hustle, Joy advertises itself to be a biographical comedy-drama but isn't faithful enough to qualify as a biography, has nothing but disappointment in store if what you are looking for is a compelling drama & forgets midway that it's supposed to be a comedy as well.Joy tells the story of its titular character, a divorced mother of three children who attempts to overcome the overwhelming obstacles in her personal & professional life by bringing her invention into the commercial market, which becomes an overnight success and marks the first step in her rise from a nobody to the founder & matriarch of a powerful business dynasty.Written & directed by David O. Russell, the first act of Joy has no trouble at all in getting on your nerves for Russell goes horribly smug about his ability to create interesting characters and overburdens the plot with way too many irrelevant people, who never for once allow its titular character to breathe comfortably, plus their contribution amounts to pretty much nothing in the end.Russell tries too hard in the beginning because of which the supporting cast he introduces us to turn end up being annoying much earlier than expected, thus leaving the responsibility of taking the story past the finish line on its leading lady. Editing also is an issue for the story meanders on moments that are tiresome, Cinematography adds nothing to the experience, and even the soundtrack isn't effective.Coming to the performances, Joy features quite an ensemble in Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Edgar Ramirez, Isabella Rossellini, Bradley Cooper & others, amongst whom only Lawrence is able to deliver the goods. The supporting cast is anything but supportive, mostly due to the lack of characterisation in Russell's script, and while Lawrence tries to do whatever she can, she doesn't have enough material to work with.On an overall scale, Joy could've been a highly fascinating biopic for there are tiny glimpses of a hidden gem in its content but instead, it turns out to be an absolute mess that manages to stay afloat only due to Lawrence's commitment. The first act is annoying, the middle part is its only saviour while the third act arrives too abruptly & ends everything a tad too quickly. Definitely the most underwhelming of all Russell-Lawrence collaborations, sitting through Joy was a joyless experience.",Null,29,63,29 December 2015
Moon," One Of The Rarest Gems & Most Under-appreciated Works Of 21st Century Cinema
","Movies don't get anymore underrated than Duncan Jones' feature film debut. An incredibly polished, downright original & thoroughly engrossing effort that's brought to life with remarkable care, brims with endless passion & stays firmly grounded throughout its runtime, Moon is a masterwork of science-fiction filmmaking that presents the first-time filmmaker in complete control of his craft, is deftly scripted from start to finish, and is all the more boosted by Sam Rockwell's heartbreaking performance & Clint Mansell's sensational score.Set in the near future, the story of Moon presents a world in which Earth's power crisis has been solved by Lunar Industries through mining an alternative fuel from lunar rocks. Stationed at their almost entirely automated lunar facility is Sam Bell whose 3-year work contract requires him to maintain operations and his only companion all this time has been an artificial intelligence named GERTY who assists with base's automation. Things are set in motion when Bell encounters something personal towards the end of his stint.Co-written & directed by Duncan Jones, Moon is crafted with confidence and the director's creativity shines above all as he manages to give his project a very sophisticated look & feel despite its modest budget. The story taps on our familiarity with the genre yet puts greater emphasis on its plot & characters instead of revelling in its futuristic sci-fi elements. In short, Jones has done an amazing job in transitioning this story on the film canvas, maintains a fine control over every single aspect, and paces it with such finesse that everyone will be able to get on board with it.From the technical standpoint, this is a film that isn't affected by budget constraints and successfully manages to come up with creative ways to realise its envisioned tale on the film canvas in its entirety. Production design team deserves kudos, for their expertly designed & meticulously detailed set pieces add an authentic vibe to the film's settings. Cinematography is another highlight, as the fluid camera-work, apt colour tones & clever lighting provide an added intensity to its images while Editing makes sure that each scene is relevant to the plot and unfolds it all in a streamlined fashion.Coming to the performances, Sam Rockwell is an absolute revelation in the role of Sam Bell, and delivers a neat, suave & wonderfully balanced input that still remains his best work to date. It was a bold move from the director to let the fate of this film be decided by a single performance but Rockwell plays his part so well that it's difficult to imagine someone else in the given role. Adding more flavours to this key aspect is Kevin Spacey whose calm demeanour & relaxed voice gives GERTY a soul of its own. And last but not the least, Clint Mansell's emotionally-stirring score elevates the experience to a whole new level, and is one of his finest compositions.On an overall scale, Moon remains one of the rarest gems & most under-appreciated works of 21st century cinema that not only ranks as one of the best films of its year but also deserves a place amongst the finest examples of its genre. A smart, slick & promising start to Duncan Jones' directional career, scoring high on both scientific realism & storytelling aspects, and overflowing with existential themes that paint a heartfelt portrait of what it means to be human, Moon is science-fiction in its purest form, that discards the usual distractions & focuses entirely on the emotional journey of its character. Outstandingly directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, tightly edited, beautifully scored & brilliantly performed, Moon comes strongly recommended. Don't miss it.",Null,2,3,13 August 2016
Her," I've Never Loved Anyone The Way I Love You.
","In today's world where majority of people's daily lives are spent interacting with their phones & computers, a world where people are virtually in touch with everyone through internet but can't even recall the names of their neighbours, a world where technology has seeped into the modern human relationships so much that it is making its presence felt unlike ever before through online dating, cyber chat or phone sex, and a world where people living in distant places are still able to make their long-distance relationships work including those who've never met each other before, a cinema like this couldn't have arrived at a better moment.Her tells the story of Theodore Twombly; a lonely writer who develops an intimate relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every needs. Now the premise may look laughable on paper but on seeing it you'll discover that Spike Jonze has crafted it with so much care that it only inspires affection. Also, It illustrates a not so distant future towards which our society is already headed & is the most accurate reflection of 21st century relationships that explores our disconnection from face-to-face conversations, the isolated lifestyle we are slowly getting accustomed to, as well as our desperate need for love & companionship in order to overcome the emptiness that abounds our lives.Directed by Spike Jonze, this is his finest feature of his short but impressive career & here he provides a post-modern feel to the film by taking inspirations from the technologies that's available today, betting on where its next evolutionary leap could be & exploring that breakthrough with grounded realism. The script itself is one stunning work of originality & creativity too. Production design puts up an advanced vision of a world that feels strangely familiar. Cinematography makes ingenious use of colour palettes & lighting to add more vividness to the story that ultimately contrasts with the colourless world its characters are living in. Editing gives this story a much admirable relaxed pace & the score by Arcade Fire is immensely intimate, heartwarming & soul-stirring.Coming to the performances, Her features an incredibly talented cast in Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde & Scarlett Johansson and every actor has contributed something unique here. Phoenix gives a sweet, sincere & heartfelt rendition of Theodore; a sad, lonely & melancholic person who has lost touch with his once social self. Amy Adams has never been as adorable as she is in this film. Rooney Mara has a flashback presence mostly & Olivia Wilde was no slouch in the only sequence she appeared in. But it's Samantha (the voice behind Theodore's intuitive OS) whom I loved most & is perfectly voiced by Scarlett Johansson, who gives this A.I. voice its own heart & soul in what could be a career-best performance. Also, it's neither Samantha nor Theodore but their sizzling chemistry that makes this unusual love story work in surprising ways.On an overall scale, Her is one of the most original, inventive & beautiful love stories to have come out in a long time and presents the most exciting & strange romance-related concept since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. As a story of love, it isn't very far from reality for those who don't get to spend much time with their loved ones or those who are or have been in long-distance relationships & it's these people with whom this film will strike a more personal chord. And as a social commentary, it examines our increasing obsession with technology plus how these gadgets which were made in order to bring people more in touch with each other are having an entirely opposite effect on society & where this trend could lead us in the near future. Arguably the best film of the year & certainly the most timely romance of a generation, Spike Jonze's Her is extremely recommended.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",Null,2,5,14 February 2014
The Nice Guys," A Ravishing, Rambunctious & Rollicking Ride That's As Thrilling As It Is Amusing
","From the writer-director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys is another ravishing, rambunctious & rollicking ride that's full of laugh-out-loud moments, captures the magical vibe of the 1970s with finesse, balances the elements of comedy & thriller in a seamless fashion, and is further bolstered by charismatic performances from Russell Crowe & Ryan Gosling.Taking place in Los Angeles around 1977, The Nice Guys tells the story of a private detective who's hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a famous porn star. The trail leads him to a young girl who hires an enforcer to keep him off her. But when she goes missing, the two detectives team up to find her, only to later discover that the whole plot is far more complicated than they imagined.Written & directed by Shane Black, the film brims with plenty of style, is downright witty & makes excellent use of its resources for the most part. The first half is a laughter riot and presents Black at his best but the second half fizzles out of energy after a while plus the big reveal unfortunately isn't as rewarding as expected. Nevertheless, the narrative stays funny & thoroughly entertaining.The 1970s atmosphere is brought to life with vibrancy, thanks to its outstanding production design, fitting costumes & numerous pop-culture references. Cinematography also adds more richness to the story with its energetic camera-work & exquisite use of bright colour palette. The first half is brilliantly paced but it all goes downhill in the next half. And the music further evokes the 1970s feel with its selected tracks.Coming to the acting department, The Nice Guys features a colourful cast in Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Margaret Qualley & Kim Basinger, with both Crowe & Gosling stealing the show although Rice gets to have her own moments as well and does a commendable job in her given role. Crowe & Gosling do chip in with strong inputs separately but their chemistry is even better and makes the whole experience all the more enriching.On an overall scale, The Nice Guys had all the ingredients to finish as one of the finest examples of its genre(s) but it just misses out on boarding that train, thanks to its less-refined second half that simply fails to live up to the expectations set by its previous act. It still bears all the hallmarks of a Shane Black feature, and is an incessantly fun, endlessly groovy & powerfully alluring cinema that promises an equally thrilling & amusing ride to all its viewers and delivers it in sufficient doses. Definitely worth your time & money.",Null,3,7,9 August 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," 2015 Belongs To The Mad!
","What a ride! What a lovely, demented, full-throttled, high-octane, pure adrenaline, ass- kicking, batshit crazy ride! It has taken George Miller 3 decades to come up with another chapter in the franchise that didn't just catapult him into the league of the finest action filmmakers alive today but also went on to change the entire landscape of all things post- apocalyptic.And with Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth instalment & a possible reboot of the Mad Max series, Miller has crafted something that's destined to go down as one of the most electrifying, exhilarating & explosively entertaining action films of the past few decades for the frenzied madness that explodes from every single frame of this vehicular carnage effortlessly makes up for those 30 years of absence.Set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland where civilisation has broken down completely, Mad Max tells the story of Max; a drifter in the desert landscape who's taken captive by the War Boys; Army of the God-like tyrant Immortan Joe & is used as a 'blood bag'. His only chance of survival is Joe's Imperator Furiosa who has gone rogue with what Joe considers his most prized assets. And so begins the chase that only the craziest can survive.Co-written & directed by George Miller who returns to the genre he validated with Mad Max Trilogy, Fury Road proves that despite after 30 years of gap, Miller remains the undisputed mastermind when it comes to vehicular mayhem. And by upgrading the post-apocalyptic elements for the new generation of filmgoers yet retaining the unprecedented charm of old- school action, Miller's kinetic direction succeeds in keeping the legacy of its franchise alive.The screenplay doesn't involve much of verbal exposition for it's the non-stop action here that handles the storytelling part & defines the characters inhabiting this picture. The visual narration is carried out so well that it doesn't even require its audience to be well-versed in English to understand what's happening in the film. The story also has a surprising level of depth but it requires the viewers to do a bit of digging themselves if they want to find it.The themes of oppression & feminism is strongly highlighted, human objectification attitude is heavily criticised, plus women in this story are no damsels-in-distress and these elements are incredibly refreshing to see since they're rarely found in action flicks. The subversion to sexism in Mad Max: Fury Road does mark the beginning of something new in action cinema & it's going to be really interesting to see where it journeys from this point onwards.Coming to the technical aspects, Mad Max: Fury Road is a marvel of action filmmaking. Art Direction team wonderfully brings to life Miller's vision of the desolate future, Camera-work is absolutely breathtaking for the chosen angles, movements & slow-mo shots enhance its action, use of vivid colours defies the usually desaturated look of post-apocalyptic films, every frame is captured in extensive detail & all of it is as its best during moments of action.Editing also keeps the momentum going in its favour by fiercely pacing the picture & knows when to kill the switch to prevent it from exhaustion. Adding more refinement to its premise is its expertly conducted sound design that further enhances every explosion, gunshot & crashes present in the film. And finally we have Junkie XL providing the background score that keeps the film on the verge of explosion at all times with its adrenaline-rushing, pulse- pounding & dynamic tracks.Still, the best thing about Mad Max: Fury Road remains its groundbreaking action for the story puts on screen some of the most dangerous, inventive & jaw-dropping stunts ever committed on film celluloid. In a time when most blockbusters rely on excessive CGI which adds nothing to the emotional content, this is one cinema that makes every bit of its $150 million budget count by embracing the old-school practical effects over CGI & keeping the presence of the latter to its bare minimum.As far as acting goes, the cast is led by Tom Hardy & Charlize Theron and the contribution from the supporting actors is pretty solid. Stepping into the shoes of the iconic character that once belonged to Mel Gibson, Hardy exhibits a magnetic screen presence but as far as his work is concerned, he either tries too hard or too little & whatever accent he was going for, it never works out. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron delivers a truly badass performance as Furiosa & in most ways, she's the real lead of this film.On an overall scale, Mad Max: Fury Road is a deranged masterpiece that does total justice to both the Mad as well as the Max part of its title and is the most complete, fully realised & unadulterated action flick of the past few decades. The insanity, chaos & destruction it puts on the screen is in a league of its own for this picture is the most action-packed, viscerally thrilling & emotionally rewarding cinematic experience any action aficionado can ever hope for. And if there's one thing Mad Max: Fury Road guarantees, it's that 2015 belongs to the mad!",Null,2,7,18 May 2015

Warcraft," A Cringeworthy Experience And An Absolute Waste Of Duncan Jones' Talents.
","Fantasy may not be an easy genre to pull off but one doesn't need to look past the prologue of The Lord of the Rings to get an idea of what all it takes to plant the seeds of interest in the minds of the filmgoing audience and compel even the newcomers to tag along on a journey to a world they don't know anything about. Even Harry Potter series serves as a pretty good example, if not an ideal one.Warcraft, on the other hand, is cringeworthy from start to finish. Infested with excess CGI, terrible screenplay, soulless characters, forgettable performances & incompetent direction from the very filmmaker who's responsible for two of the most amazing sci-fi flicks in recent memory, his latest is a bland cinema that fails to create any sort of interest at any given time, and is simply a pain to sit through.Based on the popular video game of the same name, the story of Warcraft unfolds in the kingdom of Azeroth where peace is disrupted when it is invaded by a fearsome race of orc warriors who are fleeing from their dying world into Azeroth through a portal. With one world facing destruction and other facing extinction, the plot follows two warriors from opposing forces whose actions ultimately decide the fate of their family & race.Directed by Duncan Jones (best known for Moon & Source Code), Warcraft is an absolute waste of his talents and marks the first dent of his impressive career. Without familiarising the viewers with the world it puts on screen, the film dives into its main plot within the opening minutes and follows it up with one inexplicable scene on top of another. There isn't even an attempt to explain what's happening here as most of it makes no sense at all, and the film as a whole is far too up its ass to notice that.Even the technical aspects are a letdown in this effects-laden picture. The grand set pieces have no sense of awe to them and the production design team fails to infuse a live-action feel to those props. Camera-work is lazy although it does duplicate the ambiance of its source material, Editing is a nightmare as this narrative is all over the place while its pacing is even worse. Characters are cardboard cutouts and performances aren't any better either. Even Ramin Djawadi's soundtrack fails to provide an epic vibe.On an overall scale, Warcraft is one of the worst films I've ever seen and this level of monstrosity wasn't expected from someone like Duncan Jones. No introduction, no explanation & no sense of direction, this uninspiring feature is shoddily crafted, sluggishly paced & horribly performed and I can't think of one redeemable quality about it. Failing at even the basic aspects of storytelling and presenting its director diving head-first into the sea of CGI excess, Warcraft is fantasy filmmaking at its very worst. An absolute waste of time. Skip it, folks.",Null,2,5,18 August 2016
Gladiator," An Extraordinary Feat Of Epic Filmmaking!
","Ancient Rome comes alive in breathtaking detail in Ridley Scott's historical epic that presents the esteemed filmmaker in sublime form for Gladiator is truly monumental in both scope of its ambition & scale of its production, is easily amongst the greatest spectacles to surface on the big screen, and is an extraordinary feat of its genre that not only scores high marks in its technical aspects but is equally accomplished in the storytelling department, thus succeeding as a masterpiece of epic filmmaking that delivers on all fronts.The story of Gladiator follows Maximus Decimus Meridius, a loyal general who after leading the Roman army to victory in a decisive battle finds himself betrayed when Commodus (son of the Emperor) murders his father & takes the throne for himself. Arrested & sentenced to death, Maximus manages to escape but is unable to save his family and is then taken captive by slavers. Driven by retribution, the General who became a slave then trains as a gladiator and ultimately returns to Rome to avenge the murder of his family as well as his King.Directed by Ridley Scott, Gladiator is the perfect exemplification of all his trademarks and is undoubtedly his finest output since the 1979 horror classic, Alien, for the level of detail in every frame of this fable is absolutely staggering. His direction also exhibits a much better control on the narrative elements than most of his works and for a historical drama, it is expertly paced. The screenplay packs in an interesting set of characters, their arc is methodically progressed, and despite the subplots related to supporting figures, the focus remains on Maximus throughout its runtime.As far as elements of technical filmmaking go, Gladiator is nothing short of a marvel. Production design team does a magnificent job in putting up set pieces that are grand, imposing & meticulously refined with the real standout being the Colosseum itself which is undeniably a sight to behold. The culture, politics & life within the Roman Empire is illustrated in splendid detail. Costumes, artefacts & other props are in sync with the timeline its story is set in but it also incorporates a slightly urban touch to it that brings a flavour of its own into the picture and enhances the look & feel of the whole imagery.Cinematography makes precise use of nearly all the techniques in the book at just the right moments whether it's the slow-mo shots, chaotic camera-work, time-lapse photography, panning shots, close-ups, zoom-ins & zoom-outs, and the reason why every bit of it works is because none of it is overused. Even the colour palette ranges from cold to warm tones, numerous filters are used for differentiating locations, and lighting is pitch-perfect. Editing provides a steady pace to the whole narrative plus the unfolding of events is effectively controlled considering that its 155 minutes of runtime never becomes an issue.Visual effects team also deserves kudos for restoring the Colosseum to the glory of its heyday with CGI assistance but its use is still minimal for most of the effects in the picture are practical yet it all looks incredibly authentic. However, what really uplifts the entire experience and provides Gladiator its sense of grandness is Hans Zimmer's majestic score for it comprises of tracks that are rousing & resonant and effortlessly match the film's colossal magnitude. The best bits are saved for battle sequences but that doesn't mean the soundtrack isn't able to enrich other moments for it, as a whole, remains one of the most celebrated compositions of Zimmer's career.Coming to the performances, Gladiator features a reliable cast in Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Richard Harris & others. Leading from the front is Crowe in what still remains his finest work to date. The ruggedness of his voice combined with the comfort Crowe exhibits in the skin of Maximus makes him a commanding figure worthy of respect and impressive enough for viewers to invest their emotions in. Phoenix is thoroughly committed to his role and makes up for an interesting antagonist. Nielson chips in with a terrific input to stand out in a cast filled with men while Reed, Jacobi & Hounsou play their given roles in a wise manner.On an overall scale, Gladiator manages to live up to its larger- than-life story of a general who became a slave who became a gladiator who defied an emperor and is thematically rich, technically accomplished & spectacularly entertaining from beginning to end. Ingeniously directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, smartly edited, outstandingly scored & strongly performed, this epic is engaging from the first frame, is brought to life with great care & attention to detail, and benefits immensely from an assured filmmaker at helm. Holding back nothing, packed with memorable quotes and boasting many astounding moments over the course of its runtime, Gladiator is a cinematic treasure that's worthy of all its accolades.

The Social Network," A Monumental Achievement Of Modern Filmmaking
","The very template of an assured masterpiece, The Social Network is what happens when an impeccable script, a visionary director & a committed cast n crew come together under one roof, and work in such perfect harmony with each other. A monumental achievement of modern filmmaking, The Social Network is the defining portrait of a generation & a masterpiece for the ages.Illustrating the founding of Facebook, the story of The Social Network follows Mark Zuckerberg; a Harvard sophomore who in his dorm room creates a social networking site which would later take over the digital world unlike anything before or after, but later finds himself being sued by two brothers who claim that he stole their idea & also by the co-founder who was squeezed out of the company.Directed by David Fincher, The Social Network presents the renowned filmmaker at his bloody best for he's crafted the picture with great care, confidence & sophistication, plus the balance between its style & substance are of topmost quality. Written by Aaron Sorkin, the script is easily amongst the decade's finest for the smallest of ingredients end up making the story all the more engaging.Coming to the technical aspects, The Social Network is pretty much flawless. Production design team does a stellar job in providing the required hip, urban ambiance. Cinematography is absolutely perfect; whether it's the camera movements, colour composition or lighting, Editing is extremely tight for there isn't any dull moment in the story & it retains its terrific pace from start to finish.Marking the beginning of a new director-composer collaboration, the background score of The Social Network is composed by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, and for the seamless manner in which its tracks integrate with the film's events, provide an increased momentum to the story & elevate the cinematic experience to a whole new level, the soundtrack is no less groundbreaking feat in itself.The cast comprises of Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer & Rooney Mara, with each chipping in with brilliant work. Eisenberg is quite a revelation in his role of Mark Zuckerberg & delivers a highly energetic performance, Garfield follows him closely as Eduardo Saverin; co-founder of Facebook, Timberlake is in as Sean Parker while Hammer plays along nicely as Winklevoss twins.On an overall scale, The Social Network is a perfect blend of all the ingredients one requires to make a great film & under the assured direction of David Fincher, ends up accomplishing much more. Downright engaging, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying, The Social Network may not be an entirely accurate account of the events leading to Facebook's creation but it certainly is modern filmmaking at its very best.",Null,0,1,15 October 2013
Macbeth," An Overambitious Art-house Flick That Will Enthral Some & Frustrate Others.
","There's no denying that the latest film adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most celebrated plays is ravishingly beautiful to look at, is more or less faithful to its source material in content and features committed performances from both Michael Fassbender & Marion Cotillard but the Shakespearean dialogues, woeful pace & experimental nature turns it into a cinema that will divide its audience.Based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name, Macbeth follows its titular character who, after a bloody battle, is approached by witches who tell him that one day he will become the King of Scotland. Blinded by ambition & coerced by his wife, Macbeth brutally murders his highness to take the throne for himself but soon becomes paranoid & turns into an imminent threat for his own kingdom.Directed by Justin Kurzel, the issue I have with this picture is that the Shakespearean language its cast have to utter becomes annoying real soon and is more suited to the world of theatres & opera than a film celluloid. Others may admire it for the same reason but I was having facepalm moments after the first 10 minutes. The main plot, however, closely resembles the material it is adapted from despite its lavish presentation.Cinematography is a definite highlight for the camera makes wonderful use of warm colour palette, lighting & shadows is pure wizardry, images are captured in splendid detail and the visual design is sumptuous to look at. The opening moment did feel like the cameraman was drunk and had trouble in keeping the device static but it's a smooth ride afterwards. Editing could've paced it better while the background score only works in bits n pieces.Coming to the performances, Macbeth features a fine cast in Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Sean Harris, David Thewlis & others. Fassbender's rendition of Macbeth is impressive on a visceral scale while Cotillard is effortlessly enchanting as Lady Macbeth. Their expression is simply spot on but just like the film's stupefying photography, the Shakespearean accent they try so hard to nail is unnecessarily distracting.On an overall scale, Macbeth is an overambitious art-house flick that will hypnotise its viewers with its rich, colourful & vivid imagery yet there are going to be few who'll find it a chore to sit through due to its sluggish pace, poetic conversations, empty spectacle, half-baked characters & tedious narration. Definitely not a film for all, Macbeth has a lot in store for art-house enthusiasts or fans of Shakespeare's tragedy but other than its spellbinding images, it was a vapid experience for me.",Null,0,2,30 January 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," Touching, Inspiring & Uplifting But Also Overly Sentimental At Times
","Touching, inspiring & emotionally uplifting but also overly sentimental at times, The Pursuit of Happiness is a tenderly crafted, expertly narrated & brilliantly performed biographical drama that's brought to life with utmost care & sincerity, and is also notable for featuring one of Will Smith's most memorable performances to date.The Pursuit of Happiness tells the story of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman who loses his wife, his house, his bank accounts & is forced to live out in the streets with his son when the device he invested his entire life savings into does not produce the results he was hoping for. Desperate for a steady job, he takes an unpaid internship to compete for the paid position of a stockbroker.Directed by Gabriele Muccino, the story unfolds at a steady pace and is able to keep the interest alive throughout its runtime. The struggles, disappointments & desperation that our protagonist undergoes is highlighted in a grounded manner and is relatable to quite an extent. Its character- driven plot & deftly written script provides sufficient depth to our lead guy's arc that effortlessly allows the viewers to invest in his journey.Coming to the performances, The Pursuit of Happiness is a one-man show that finds Will Smith at the top of his game as he chips in with an emotionally dense, wonderfully balanced & surprisingly down-to-earth input and it remains one of the finest works of his acting career. Jaden Smith also provides a heartfelt support in the role of Gardner Jr. and the moments between this father & son duo are beautifully captured.There are times when it goes slightly overboard with its melodramatic elements but for the most part, the emotional response it garners from its viewers is well-earned. The technical aspects are finely executed, Editing is smoothly carried out and keeps its plot moving ahead at a consistent pace, while its background score silently enhances the overall experience with its mesmerising tracks and nicely compliments the whole narrative.On an overall scale, The Pursuit of Happiness is a fascinating illustration of the American dream that also serves as an engrossing portrait of father-son bonding, and is amongst the best films of its year. Powered by a strong lead show by one of Hollywood's most bankable stars and delighting its audience with a real-life story that's heartwarming, heartbreaking & gratifying on more levels than one, The Pursuit of Happiness comes thoroughly recommended.",Null,0,0,16 September 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A Remarkable Sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark
","After the enormously successful Raiders of the Lost Ark & the highly disappointing Temple of Doom, Steven Spielberg & George Lucas bring back the very ingredients that made the former a defining classic of its genre plus infused it with lots of humour & heart to make the third film in the planned trilogy a fitting conclusion to the Indiana Jones saga.Set in 1938 & once again pitting our eminent archaeologist adventurer against the Nazis, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade covers the pursuit of the Holy Grail but mainly concerns the troubled relationship between Indiana Jones & his father; a Holy Grail scholar who has been kidnapped by Nazis. And so Indiana embarks on another adventure to find his father & also stop the Nazis from obtaining the mystical artifact.Opening with a highly impressive sequence that also served as the origin story of our beloved archaeologist, Steven Spielberg's direction expertly brings back the energy, excitement & quality that was lost in the previous film and keeps the plot relatively fresh & engaging from start to finish. The script is easily the wittiest of the three & keeps the lighthearted mood alive until the very end.Cinematography meticulously captures all the moments of action & drama and is constantly moving, set pieces & locations are wisely chosen, editing makes the runtime fly by and John Williams' score beautifully accompanies the adventure with its wonderful tracks. The visual effects also deserves a nod for its contribution to the film & the action sequences are spectacularly carried out.Coming to the performances, The Last Crusade brings back Harrison Ford & John Rhys-Davies in their respective roles of Indiana Jones & Sallah but also joining aboard this time is Sean Connery as Indiana's father; Henry Jones Sr., River Phoenix as young Jones in the prologue & others but the most exciting part for me remains the stunning father-son chemistry between Ford & Connery that makes this film work very well.On an overall scale, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is an amazing sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark which expands the horizon & builds upon its premise without losing any of its attributes. Fiercely paced, wildly entertaining and featuring a gripping plot filled with right doses of action, humour, drama, mystery & adventure, it was the perfect finale for Indiana Jones saga & the final shot of the characters riding into the sunset couldn't have confirmed it better.",Null,1,3,14 October 2013

Featuring a lively concept, filled with interesting characters & packing no shortage of thrills, it remains one of the defining works of 1980s Hollywood cinema.Co-written & directed by Robert Zemeckis, there is hardly any wasted scene in this picture as it quickly acquaints us with its story setup, and establishes its tone with an instantly captivating opening segment that bears similarity to Spielberg's style. Every moment is accounted for, no residue is left behind, and once the main story kicks in, Zemeckis makes sure the momentum is never lost and keeps the interest alive till the end.The writing is no slouch, for it makes sure the plot is constructed in a way so that every action only develop the arcs of characters involved without deviating from course, compromising with its entertainment factor or slowing down its 88 miles pace. Further assistance comes from its era-appropriate sets, kinetic camerawork, consistent dose of action, excellent wit, breezy narrative flow, exciting score & fab inputs from Michael J.

Goodfellas," A Thoroughly Investigated, Extensively Detailed & Wickedly Amusing Crime Opus
","An extensively investigated, thoroughly detailed & wickedly amusing crime opus that's stylishly directed & brilliantly acted, Goodfellas is considered by some to be an even better crime drama than Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and while I don't share the same sentiment, I don't deny its influence & impact on the films that followed into its footsteps.Goodfellas chronicles the rise & fall of mob associate Henry Hill & his friends from the 1950s to 1980s. The story follows his journey in the mafia world, covering his relationship with his wife and his two associates Jimmy Conway & Tommy DeVito, as the trio work their way up through the mob hierarchy, and culminates with the events that lead to their eventual downfall.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film begins in the middle and then work its way around it before coming full circle in the end, thus taking us on a riotous journey that's never tiring. The dialogues are sharp & piercing, the chemistry between the trio has a genuine quality & a sense of brotherhood to it. The violence is brutal & unflinching, and the characters are lively & compelling.The filmmaking technicalities are handled really well, giving its images a frenzied vibe as if things may explode anytime without warning, and they do on multiple occasions. Also notable is the neat cinematography that makes its apt set pieces stand out. But the story as a whole still feels longer than it needed to be, and its 145 minutes runtime is severely felt during the second half.Coming to the performances, Goodfellas features a reliable cast in Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci & Ray Liotta, with Pesci stealing the show with a wild, deranged act that overshadows all in his vicinity. Liotta is in as Henry Hill and delivers an impressive lead show that only gets better with time. De Niro chips in with an assured input yet he feels somewhat under-utilised. Lorraine Bracco & Paul Sorvino also provide excellent support and leave a lasting impression of their own.On an overall scale, Goodfellas captures the glamorous & grisly side of organised crime with finesse and offers a consistently thrilling ride to finish as a fascinating example of its genre. The story is at its best when the screen is shared by the trio but loses steam when it focuses on their individual lives. Riveting at first, the film ends up running a tad too long for me and the interest is already lost by the time it nears its conclusion. A well-researched account of a real-life story, Goodfellas is admirable in its own ways but to rank it alongside The Godfather is pure lunacy.",Null,0,0,29 September 2018
Goodfellas," The Greatest Mob Film Ever? Really?
","Strong performances is its saving grace but as a movie overall, Goodfellas runs way too longer than it should have & although is a well researched account of organized crime, it still falls short of the greatness of The Godfather. Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period. A second viewing might change this current opinion of mine but as for now, Goodfellas is a major disappointment.",Null,1,2,14 September 2013
The Bourne Supremacy," Everything That Fans of The Bourne Identity Could've Asked For.
","Intensely gripping, relentlessly entertaining & making efficient use of the solid foundation laid down by its predecessor, The Bourne Supremacy is an explosive sequel to The Bourne Identity that improves upon the original by exhibiting upgrades in almost all departments of filmmaking and also triumphs as one of 21st century's most tightly-packed action entertainers to surface on the silver screen.Set two years after the events of the first film, The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne; a highly skilled assassin suffering from extreme memory loss, who once again finds himself at the centre of another conspiracy brewing within the CIA when he's framed for an operation that goes awry and is ultimately left with no choice but to return to the very life he tried to leave behind once his cover is blown.Taking over the directional duties from Doug Liman is Paul Greengrass whose dynamic direction brings even more energy to the film's premise than before & his signature use of hand-held cameras plays a vital role in making the story all the more immersive by capturing its events with startling immediacy. Many aren't fans of his chaotic style of filmmaking but for me, he's the absolute best when it comes to shooting a film with such vibrancy.The vigorously moving images are very well-supported by its frequent editing which keeps the plot running at a blistering speed from start to finish and it all intertwines seamlessly with John Powell's constantly evolving score that adds even more excitement to the finished product. The action sequences are dazzling to look at, illustrate a high degree of realism & are exquisitely photographed, with the final chase sequence turning out to be the most memorable one.Coming to the performances, Matt Damon reprises his role of Jason Bourne while the new additions of Karl Urban & Joan Allen also manage to leave their mark this time. Damon impresses greatly once again with his commanding screen presence & delivers a performance that's as neat n dedicated as his character. Allen wonderfully chips in as Pamela Landy; CIA's deputy director while Urban is an absolute badass in the role of Kirill; a Russian agent hired to kill Bourne.On an overall scale, The Bourne Supremacy is a high-caliber sequel to The Bourne Identity that takes its series to a whole new level without ever taking anything away from its predecessor. Ingeniously directed, cleverly written, briskly photographed, tightly edited, exuberantly scored & once again spearheaded by Matt Damon's swashbuckling performance, The Bourne Supremacy is everything that fans of the original could've asked for in a sequel.",Null,0,2,18 September 2013
13 Hours," Another Addition In The Long List of Self-Indulgent American Propaganda Films
","Made specifically for the American audience & mostly appealing to those who need their daily dose of 'hooah', 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (simply known as 13 Hours) suffers from the same set of issues that plague majority of Hollywood war flicks and while it is absolutely loathsome as far as its banal script goes, its thrilling action segments do lift it up by a few notches.13 Hours is a re-enactment of the incident that took place on the evening of September 11, 2012 in Benghazi, Libya when two American compounds came under attack from Islamic militants. The plot follows six members of the security personnel, assigned to protect the covert CIA base, and covers their night-long attempt to prevent the terrorists from storming into the compound while hoping for some help to arrive.Directed by Michael Bay, 13 Hours isn't as facepalm-inducing as his best-known flicks and actually becomes quite gripping once all hell breaks loose but the script is detestable. And this time, it isn't the clichéd plot or wooden characters that are its main cause of concern but the right-wing stance it takes to depict the whole event, thus further fuelling the nonsensical opinion a certain section of society has regarding the Middle-East.Filled with dialogues like, 'you can't tell the good guys from the bad' or 'they are all bad guys until they are not', the film echoes the 'all Muslims are terrorists' mindset that idiots easily buy into and in that regard, it isn't just worrisome but dangerous as well. However, even if one sidelines its political agenda, the film remains mediocre in content as there isn't one distinguishable character in the story plus its dramatic portions are no match to its combat sequences. On a technical scale, 13 Hours scores pretty well. The action-laden moments are choreographed to near-perfection and presents the field of battle in its raw & chaotic form, with bullets & RPGs flying in all directions. The hand-held camera-work brilliantly reflects the disorderly carnage of warfare and its colour hues & chosen camera angles further intensify the experience. Editing isn't entirely up to the mark, performances are average at best, and the background score is simply forgettable.On an overall scale, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is at its most riveting when shells & cartridges take the centerstage from its uninspiring drama and it really delivers in that department with plenty of violence, gore & mayhem. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing commendable about Michael Bay's latest. Drenched in jingoistic glory, painting a detrimental image of Libya, and filled with characters no one gives a damn about, 13 Hours is another middling entry in the long list of typical self-indulgent American propaganda films.",Null,3,13,2 July 2016
The Birds," How Clueless We Are Against the Forces of Nature.
","An absolutely terrifying tale of suspense & horror, an extraordinary achievement in technical filmmaking and a perfect demonstration of how clueless & unprepared we are against the forces of nature, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds remains one of the most under-appreciated works in cinema history & is amongst my top 3 favourite films from this genius filmmaker.Beginning on a relaxed note which only serves as a deep breath before the plunge, The Birds concerns a wealthy San Francisco socialite who pursues her romantic interest to his small Northern California town where things soon take a turn for the bizarre as its entire community is suddenly & viciously attacked by birds of all kinds for no specified reasons.Ingeniously directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the first half is pretty much a romantic tale that nicely introduces & sets up its characters while also slowly but steadily building up its foreshadowing events which ultimately take over the screen like an invading horde and completely changes the mood & atmosphere into a downright terrorizing one.The screenplay is loosely based on the 1952 story of the same name & although the dialogues don't carry that much weight, the events are penned down brilliantly as almost every scene featuring the birds is a tense one. Camera-work is exquisitely carried out, editing never lets the boredom sets in & although it doesn't feature any score, the sound mixing aspect is a revelation of its time.The film marks the screen debut of Tippi Hedren plus also stars Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy & a young Veronica Cartwright. And although everyone chips along finely, the real star of the film is the manner in which Hitchcock really builds up its suspense or handles the mystery element by keeping the entire story highly unpredictable from start to finish.On an overall scale, The Birds is perhaps the final masterpiece to come out from Alfred Hitchcock's cannon and is one of the finest works in the genres of horror & mystery that still hasn't aged a day. It is a remarkable testament to Hitchcock's reputation as 'The Undisputed Master of Suspense' for he effortlessly manages to transform something as beautiful & innocent as birds into one of cinema's most terrifying villains.Worthy of all the praise it has garnered over the years, certainly in need of an even wider audience & deserving to be ranked amongst Hitchcock's finest films, The Birds is an amazingly well directed, smartly scripted, nicely performed & precisely crafted cinema far ahead of its time that not only promises & delivers a thrilling cinematic experience but, with its ambiguous ending, remains an unsolved mystery even today.

Sully," Another Quality Addition In The Careers Of Tom Hanks & Clint Eastwood
","Covering the unprecedented event that took place on January 15th, 2009 and scripted a historic moment in aviation history, Sully is a well-crafted & patiently narrated biopic that marks another quality addition in Clint Eastwood's filmography, is handled in a very grounded manner & benefits immensely from Tom Hanks' assured performance.Sully tells the story of US Airways pilot Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger who is hailed as a hero by press & people after successfully managing to land the damaged airplane on the Hudson river, thus saving the lives of all 155 souls aboard. The plot deals with the aftermath of the event, focusing on the investigation that followed and threatened to destroy his reputation & career.Directed by Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby & American Sniper), the story is told in a non-liner fashion, going back to the events every now n then to give the audience a piece of the puzzle yet moving ahead with the investigative process that forms the core of this film. Eastwood's direction exhibits no signs of weariness as Sully definitely ranks amongst his better works as a filmmaker.The production design team does a splendid job in recreating the entire event in meticulous detail and although artistic license is taken here n there, it only works out in the film's favour and assists in enriching the drama. Cinematography employs fine use of cold colour palette which go hand in hand with its wintry outlook while opting for warm temperatures for flashback sequences of Sully's life.Editing is nicely executed for the most part but it also adds a few unnecessary moments to stretch its runtime beyond 90 minutes, as evident in scenes that briefly focus on people aboard the plane or wherever for no reason whatsoever. The background score has an understated presence but it does surface when it's needed. Visual effects are passable and does its job but sound definitely takes things up by a notch.Coming to the performances, Sully features a reliable cast in Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn & others, and while the rest of the cast play their part well, this is the veteran actor's show all the way. Totally into his character & expressing emotions with spot-on accuracy, Hanks carries the entire film on his shoulders and delivers another stellar performance, and he is brilliantly supported by Eckhart who plays First Officer Jeffrey 'Jeff' Skiles.On an overall scale, Sully finishes as another quality addition in the careers of both Tom Hanks & Clint Eastwood, and has pretty much all the ingredients that resonates with viewers n critics alike. What's more amazing is that even at 86 years, Eastwood simply refuses to slow down and he is actually doing a better job at filmmaking than majority of directors working in Hollywood today. A quiet yet reverberating tribute to daily heroes that's brought to life with sincere workmanship, Sully is definitely worth a shot.",Null,0,0,2 January 2017
Princess Mononoke," A Landmark in the World of Animation. An Essential Treasure of World Cinema.
","This was just... Wow. I'm still mesmerized by the incredibly dense cinematic experience this anime provided from start to finish & I'm still collecting my thoughts on it. Because Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke isn't just one of the strongest feature films put out by the artistic filmmaker or Studio Ghibli as a whole but is a landmark in the world of animation whose quality story, thematic elements & breathtaking on-screen execution makes regular animated flicks look like the works of amateurs.A period drama infused with elements of fantasy & set in early centuries of Japan, Princess Mononoke tells the tale of Ashitaka; a young prince who after saving his village from a rampaging boar-god/demon is stricken by a deadly curse & journeys to the forest of the West looking for an answer, only to find himself involved in the struggle between the supernatural guardians of the forest & the humans who are consuming its resources.The title refers to a young girl who was raised by the wolf-goddess & has a strong hatred for mankind. Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is arguably the creative height of his illustrious film career & presents him in complete control of his craftsmanship. The 2D animation is absolutely dazzling, the supernatural creatures as well as forests are vividly imagined, the voice actors have done a fab job & music elegantly moves its story forward.The main theme this film deals with is the effects of industrialization on nature, deforestation & how it affects the species who've inhabited these places long before man's greed laid its eyes on their lands. On an overall scale, Princess Mononoke is an expertly crafted, deftly envisioned, gorgeously photographed, swiftly paced & masterfully composed work of art & entertainment which transcends the confines of animation with its complex story, strong characterization, adult themes & makes its statement heard rousingly clear.A standard of 2D animation, a treasure of world cinema, and arguably the pinnacle of Studio Ghibli's creativity, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) is strongly, extremely & one hundred percent recommended to each & every film lover around the world.",Null,3,5,3 May 2014

","As informative as it is intriguing, Valkyrie is a finely carved, swiftly paced & well acted historical account that takes a leaflet out of the countless unforgettable events which occurred during the Second World War, and brings it to cinematic life in a tense & gripping fashion but what hinders it from making the desired impact is Tom Cruise's own star presence.Though this film is no masterpiece, it does bring to light the legacy of Claus von Stauffenberg & his noble cause to show the world that not everyone in Germany shared Hitler's ideals. It works as a thriller, it is thoroughly engaging & it continues getting better as plot progresses before finishing on a powerful note but it isn't impressive enough to garner a spot amongst the finest examples of its genre. Still worth a shot for sure.",Null,0,1,16 July 2017
Alien: Covenant," The Path To Paradise Begins In Hell
","The second instalment in the Alien prequel series finds director Ridley Scott caving in to audience expectations by doing away with most of the philosophical ideas he introduced in Prometheus and focusing more on the horror aspect to create a traditional scary movie. Alien: Covenant is quite an improvement over its predecessor, for it brings back the tension, suspense, violence & screams in all its unadulterated glory while validates the existence of Prometheus in the process.Set 10 years after the events that transpired in Prometheus, the story of Alien: Covenant follows the crew of a colonisation ship that is headed to a remote planet with thousands of colonists & embryos onboard. Things are set in motion when a neutrino burst damages the ship, prematurely awakens the crew & results in few casualties. Soon after, the team intercepts a radio signal from a nearby planet and head there to investigate, only to encounter a threat beyond their imagination.Directed by Ridley Scott, the first half of the film is brilliant as the esteemed director maintains a firm grip on pacing & tension to build up suspense and encapsulates the picture with a foreboding atmosphere. The next half is where things begin to dwindle as the plot heads into a familiar zone before culminating on a predictable note. Another drawback that makes its way from Prometheus to this feature is that the characters are poorly scripted, and remain just as dumb & uninteresting as before.When it comes to technical side of filmmaking, a Ridley Scott film rarely leaves much to complain about. Be it the set pieces or the alien species, everything that shows up in the movie is refined to the smallest of details. Cinematography envelops the images with a dark, ominous & eerie climate with its smart camera-work, cold colour palette & apt lighting. Editing is brilliant in the first half but tumbles down in the remaining half. And Jed Kurzel contributes with an infernal score that also incorporates tracks from both Alien & Prometheus.Coming to the acting department, Michael Fassbender's performance is the only one that leaves a positive impression. Utilising his silent yet piercing gaze to near perfection, he puts up a controlled act that carries an uneasy vibe and gets more unnerving as the plot progresses. Waterston plays her character in a straight-forward fashion but there's nothing about her character that's remotely interesting. The rest of the cast is more or less forgettable. In short, there are only two fascinating characters in the movie, and Fassbender excels at playing both of them.On an overall scale, Alien: Covenant is nothing more than a dumbed-down version of Alien with a final twist that's absurdly obvious. It discards the existential ambition of Prometheus and picks up all the gruesome moments from the preceding chapters to cater to the masses. And, in a way, it implants a belief that Scott was probably on to something profound with Prometheus and now we will never get to see his original vision. Thrilling, entertaining & satisfying yet wholly insignificant, Alien: Covenant adds nothing vital to the saga nor takes the series in a new direction but after the disaster that was Prometheus, this deep-space terror is just what the doctor ordered.",Null,2,10,23 May 2017

The Wizard of Oz," If You Didn't See It While You Were A Kid, Then You're In For A Tumultuous Ride
","Packed with songs that aren't catchy at all, filled with characters that are way more annoying than one would care to admit & challenging my patience with its cartoonish visuals & childish character interactions, The Wizard of Oz may be the staple of the American pop culture, and is undoubtedly legendary for its influence & cultural impact but it is also a film that belongs to its era, for it looks awfully dated today.",Null,1,5,23 June 2017
The Martian," Following Into The Footsteps Of Gravity & Interstellar, The Martian Is The Space Expedition Of 2015
","A fascinating blend of science, action, adventure, drama, suspense & humour, The Martian is a deeply informative, thoroughly engrossing & highly amusing sci-fi epic that follows into the footsteps of Gravity & Interstellar to succeed as the space expedition of 2015 and also marks a welcome return to form for director Ridley Scott, who had been going through a rough patch in recent years.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Martian is set in the near future and tells the story of Mark Watney; a botanist & member of the Mars manned mission crew who finds himself left alone on the red planet after separating from his crewmates during a fierce dust storm. With limited supplies, he has no choice but to science the sh*t out of everything in oder to send a signal back to Earth and stay alive till someone gets there to rescue him.Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner & Gladiator), The Martian makes heavy use of all his trademarks and is a far better project that he's undertaken for the story is packs in is more promising than his previous few assignments. Drew Goddard's screenplay intercuts 3 story lines, brilliantly handles the arc of its lead character, and makes fab use of wit as even its bleak moments gleam with optimism, which is refreshing to watch coz it's rarely present in films dealing with similar scenarios.There's considerable effort involved in The Martian to accurately depict the science behind everything and with NASA on board, almost every scenario is explained in exhaustive detail and each set piece benefits from their added inputs. The microscopic presence of a man on the vast, lifeless deserts of Mars is captured in breathtaking detail by its camera. Editing is a mixed bag for its 141 minutes of runtime & unhurried pace can easily become frustrating for some. And Harry Gregson-Williams' score doesn't add much & is quite forgettable.Coming to the performances, The Martian features a promising cast in Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan & Chiwetel Ejiofor, and yet it's only Damon who owns the film all the way from start to finish. Dangerously close to being labelled a typecast for playing characters that often get stuck in unwanted places before being rescued by another team, Damon brings everything he has to deliver a wonderfully balanced performance as Mark Watney and while the supporting cast does well, it's Damon who carries the film all by himself.On an overall scale, The Martian is a visually arresting, scientifically dense & very grounded sci-fi epic about the indomitable will of the human spirit to survive against all odds and also works as an awe-inspiring space adventure, thanks to Scott's assured direction & Damon's heartwarming performance. While it still misses a few steps in the storytelling department, is longer than it needs to be, and not every attempts at humour works out in its favour, the positives outweighs the negatives and its optimistic approach to space travel & exploration, an emotionally rich experience it has in store & stringent focus on human condition despite profundity in its science makes it a cinema that's destined to please its crowd. A thrilling & timely spectacle, The Martian comes delightfully recommended.",Null,1,4,1 December 2015
The Fighter," A Powerhouse Of Riveting Performances, The Fighter Is David O. Russell's Best Film To Date
","Powered by terrific performances from its cast, The Fighter also happens to be David O. Russell's best film to date that may not rank amongst the finest examples of its genre but it still serves as a competently crafted sports biopic that's less about the sport & more about the athlete, his family & his path to redemption.The story of The Fighter follows the life of professional boxer Micky Ward who withdraws from the boxing world after suffering a humiliating defeat in a match he already had reservations about. The plot chronicles the journey he takes to get back into the ring while focusing on his relationship with his brother whose own life has taken a self-destructive route.Directed by David O. Russell (best known for Silver Linings Playbook & American Hustle), the story journeys the same route that majority of boxing films tend to take plus also falls flat in between on a few occasions but what infuses a vibrant energy into it is the rich set of interesting characters it packs in & a talented ensemble that brings those characters to life with finesse.The boxing sequences are brilliantly choreographed and do provide the necessary adrenaline high when it matters but this picture is more focused on the relationship between the two brothers and illustrates it amazingly well, for those moments do pack a powerful punch. But it also suffers from letting it characters go a bit overboard at times, something that has become a norm in O. Russell's films of lately.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, Christian Bale & Melissa Leo, with Bale & Leo impressing the most. It's not that the input by leading cast falls short in any aspect, it's just that Bale & Leo take their supporting characters to a different level, and the Academy Award they won for their respective works in this feature film is definitely an earned one.On an overall scale, The Fighter is no genre masterpiece but it still offers a sufficiently entertaining ride that will leave majority of its viewers satisfied in the end. It's not without its shortcomings but most of them get brushed away by the powerful, explosive & riveting performances delivered by its ensemble. The story isn't memorable by any means but what Bale & Leo pull off here will continue to reverberate for a few more years down the line.",Null,3,3,12 September 2016
V for Vendetta," An Uncompromising Vision Of The Future
","A vehemently crafted, voraciously told & vigorously acted cinematic vessel with a valuable & vivified voice that's as vital as it is vengeful, V for Vendetta presents an uncompromising vision of a vile future our increasingly venomous world already appears to be veering towards, and is one of the finest examples of its kind.Vicariously scripted by the Wachowskis & valiantly directed by James McTeigue in what's his directorial debut, this vividly visualised voyage of a vigilante who veneers his visage with veil, vanquishes virulent vermin of society & incites a revolution with vehicles of violence, is balanced in ways that most films of its genre never aspire to.Volatile yet vigilant from its opening scene, the film benefits immensely from Hugo Weaving's viciously charismatic performance despite only utilising his vox, and the veteran actor's voice alone vouchsafes life & soul into his vindictive character while his vacant veiled attire compels us to view him as the embodiment of an idea rather than an individual.Natalie Portman's input is just as valuable while John Hurt chips in with a volcanic work in his villainous role. The execution of technical aspects is sound throughout. Cinematography envelops the images with a bleak tone & dismal aura to illustrate life under totalitarian rule while taut editing, variegated score & brisk velocity make the viewing experience more intense & visceral.On an overall scale, V for Vendetta viciously combines elements of cautionary tale, politically charged drama & action extravaganza into a visually stunning & thought-provoking cinema that provides a voice to the voiceless, and is a valid & vociferous reminder that every society has the vim n vigour to dismantle any venal regime that violates its volition. Much more relevant today than it was at its time of release, this dystopian political thriller is by all means an essential viewing.",Null,4,4,5 November 2019
Furious 7," As Mindless As It Can Get But A Fun Romp Nonetheless
","The seventh instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Furious 7 packs in all the big- budget blockbuster ingredients to give its viewers an extravaganza worth the price of their ticket but in its aim to provide a larger-than-life entertainment, it ends up becoming so over- the-top, overdone & overlong that the whole experience of sitting through it doesn't amount to much in the end.Taking place after the events that transpired in Tokyo Drift, Furious 7 finds Dominic Toretto & his family back in the United States after he & his team earned their amnesty by finishing the job they were assigned in the previous chapter. But their peaceful life is soon disrupted when Deckard Shaw begins seeking revenge for his comatose brother by eliminating Dom's crew one by one, thus forcing Dom to reassemble his team to stop him.Directed by James Wan (best known for Saw, Insidious & The Conjuring), Furious 7 marks his first attempt at blockbuster filmmaking and while he does a good job when compared to the big-screen spectacles released these days, the very sense of fun which made previous two instalments such an enjoyable ride is sort of missing here. The main plot is compelling to an extent but it is unnecessarily contaminated with a needless subplot it could've done without.The screenplay makes use of almost every clichÃ© one can find in a story like this plus all its attempts at humour fall flat most times or isn't as well timed as before. Set pieces do get an upgrade, cars include both old-school & modern beasts, Cinematography is a letdown for the camera is in motion even when it isn't required but its action sequences are wonderfully photographed. Editing isn't up to mark either as a number of scenes are just thrown in and don't play any role in the final outcome.As far as visual effects go, Fast Five reverted to the old-school formula and made extensive use of practical effects. Fast & Furious 6 wasn't far behind but it nevertheless used CGI for a few ambitious/ridiculous sequences. Furious 7 however goes completely overboard when it comes to the use of CGI and actually revels in it as its action set pieces are too absurd to have any ground for believability. While the previous chapter toyed with the laws of physics, this one simply slaughters it with one ludicrous sequence after another.Coming to the acting department, the cast brings back the team of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson & others, with new additions being Jason Statham, Kurt Russell & Djimon Hounsou. And the sum of all performances is passable at best. It's a shame that Johnson isn't given enough time on the screen, Diesel & Walker carry their roles like they have in the previous chapters, Hounsou's input is just pathetic, Statham is nothing special despite his strong intro, and the arc of every character here is disappointing to a considerable extent.On an overall scale, Furious 7 isn't entirely devoid of fun and can be easily enjoyed if one is used to mindless blockbusters but after the resurrection of this franchise with Fast Five and the continuation of the same momentum in Fast & Furious 6, this vast drop in quality due to more emphasis on its CGI-laden action than its plot or characters wasn't expected, at least not this soon. Nevertheless, there are a few cool stuff to be found here and for the majority of its audience, it will be a much satisfying ride but for a few douchebags like me, Furious 7 is a lost opportunity.",Null,1,17,5 September 2015
The Godfather," Filmmaking At Its Most Perfect, Genuine, Complete, Crystalline & Pure.
","Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure. One hundred percent recommended.",Null,7,11,5 January 2016
