The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bella and Edward finally begin their forever together. However marriage shows to have some setbacks
","To be honest, I am a twihard. I've read every book and seen every movie so far. I can memorize pieces of the book by heart and the cast as well. However, this movie just didn't cut it even for somebody like me. After watching Harry Potter's thrilling finale, I expected something similar from this. But I guess I set my standards to high. From the opening scene with Bella's voice in voice-over I knew it was not going to meet the standards I have set for it. It is true that my standards are a bit high but it was not even close. The acting needed a lot of improvement. From Kristen Stewarts' lifeless voice and Robert Pattinson's emotionless face everything was just off. And don't even get me started on Taylor Lautner. Of course he is still as attractive as he always was but that whinny obnoxious personality can get a bit annoying. For the rest of the vampire covens, most of their performances were just standing as still as a statue, eyes wide open and having the same 'i might kill you' look on their faces. Of course this is what they're supposed to look like but having that as your only appearance? Let's get real here people. And for people who have never read the books? Well you'll be in for something more confusing the Inception. My mom, sitting next to me in the movie had to lean over and whisper to me every other scene 'what's going on?'. Their lack of sequencing was confusing at some times even for me. This movie didn't meet my expectation and really, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",3,5,14,27 November 2011
Inception," A mind-boggling heart racing movie
","This movie was just beyond what I had expected. After watching dozens of trailers for this movie, it just blew my mind when I saw it for real. All the dream/reality patterns really boggle your mind on what is real and what isn't. To admit, I was confused by this movie at the beginning. After maybe the first half hour I started to pick up on what was a dream and what was reality. Their is a new surprise around every corner and because it is so unpredictable, it truly excites you when it happens. The movie holds an all-star cast that truly did lead up to their potential. It is a stunning movie that I recommend anybody to watch!",10,1,7,27 November 2011
