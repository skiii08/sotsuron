The Avengers," From time to time you really don't want to have to think.
","It promises to be a live-action comic book and it delivers in spades. The production values and special effects are out of this world. Like a comic book though, it has a simple plot line and produces essentially zero emotional involvement. Thor is annoying and Scarlett Johansson is as flat as ever--being 'eye candy' pays her bills. Also, even granting the comic book nature of this film, Samuel Jackson was clearly just picking up a paycheck, since I've never seem him so lifeless and unconvincing.This movie is pure sugar with no redeeming nutritional value, but as a guilty pleasure it succeeds well, although too much of this stuff would personally make me nauseous.",8,1,4,11 May 2015
Blade Runner 2049," A must-see for fans of the original 'Blade Runner', but wrapped up too simplistically.
","First off, a saw the original 'Blade Runner' a long time ago, and, while I remembered the gist of it, I did't recall it with intensity due to my age and interests at the time. This sequel 'Blade Runner 2049' jogged my memories well (assuming that they're not implants), and is a very well-crafted movie with outstanding production values.I'm not going to throw any spoilers into this review, because I think that would significantly hurt the viewing experience for those who loved the original. With regard to the original, I think that it's pretty much mandatory that a viewer be fundamentally familiar with it, since it lays much of the foundation on which this plot is built.I am, however, only giving it 8 stars, because I personally feel that towards the end it took too many easy outs by way of some really blatant contemporary cultural mythologies (you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it) and avoided any actually difficult philosophical issues, something that Philip Dirk wouldn't have cared for either. Basically, it just went too 'Hollywood' towards the end for my tastes. On the flip side, this is still one of the best films I've seen in a quite a while. It's definitely a solid sequel and belongs on the 'must-see' list of every fan of the original 'Blade Runner'.",8,1,10,15 September 2019
Mission: Impossible III," It will keep you awake and even kind of makes sense.
","I guess the director really does matter, since I consider this the strongest of the first four Mission Impossible films. I really like that in this film some actors other than Tom Cruise get a little bit of screen time, because as far as I'm concerned Tom Cruise maybe a phenomenal movie star, but he is no more than a decent actor.The action in this movie is pretty much nonstop and should have no problem holding your attention, even though, of course, any number of things occur which are at or over the boundaries of physical possibility. As a bonus, the plot is basically coherent, which seems strange for a film in the 'Mission Impossible' franchise. Overall, I would characterize this movie as solid popcorn entertainment and yet totally forgettable at the same time.",7,0,0,11 May 2015
The Expendables 2," I'm sort of embarrassed that I kind of liked it.
","I'm embarrassed that I sorta liked this. Sometimes I like to give something I know is basically dumb a try, just because sometimes dumb things are fun. Let's be honest, you would have to be brain dead not to know basically what to expect here, the only question is whether or not it is watchable. In this case the movie starts out pretty strong, but by the time we get to the last third, I'm pretty sure the script just read: shoot a lot of people, blow up a lot of things, try to occasionally toss in some clever or ironic quips and banter (most of which failed due to being far too self-conscious and inauthentically self-deprecating--I wouldn't expect any of these guys to be able to tell a good joke). I knew that I was just consuming motion picture cotton candy when I started this, but by the end I was diabetic. If they had shown more restraint with the mindless action, especially towards the end, this would have been a much stronger film. Also, this movie was obviously supposed to have elements of parody to it, but that aspect just fell flat--neither the script nor the actors were up to it. Lastly, we get a clear demonstration that the only halfway decent actor in the whole bunch is Bruce Willis--if nothing else, he does smirking better than anyone else in the whole world. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris were particularly agonizing to watch. It'd be cruel to put either in a wet paper bag, because neither could act their way out.With all that said, this movie still mostly held my attention until the end, although it'll be a while before I'll be opening a vein again for another Hollywood big-budget, totally nutritionless, sugar overdose like this one.",6,0,0,11 May 2015
Skyfall," I want my Bond back.
","Just stop with the re-booted Bond. Does this guy ever smile? Why so serious Bond? Maybe if we tickle him? Does he ever say anything funny or clever anymore? OK, some toys, plenty of action, etc. and it fulfills all of it's low ambitions. But Craig is wearing thin with this whole serious actor bit. I like Shakespeare a lot actually, but this is James Bond, so please just stop making it more 'sophisticated,' 'better reflective of the times we are living in,' and all that other miscellaneous claptrap. Next up--Goth Bond starring Johnny Depp. (I probably shouldn't have made that last comment, since now I'm sure production will start in a few months.) Lastly, did anybody count bullets in the beginning scene? I guess they haven't entirely lost their sense of humor.",6,6,9,12 May 2015
The Ring," Creepy horror flick that would rate higher if I didn't know that a better version existed
","First, I must confess that I have never seen the original Japanese 'Ring' movie, but in my experience, without exception, the original foreign production is better than the Americanized version. There's just something that Hollywood and big budgets do to drain the life out of foreign movies when they remake them. Generally, it means emotion and nuance go out the window in the name of making a big hit at the theaters. So, even though I've never seen it, I'm sure the Japanese original is better.This is still an effective and creepy horror movie with a decently original plot (neglecting the fact that it's a remake). I never knew where it was going and what was going to happen next. There isn't much actual gore, but, without really ever letting up, it builds sense of dread and claustrophobia as it builds along. I'm definitely not going to give any of the plot away, but it's really not like any other horror movies I can think of off hand. I'm not the biggest horror movie aficionado, but I like to watch one now and again, and this is solidly on the better side. Now if only I could get my hands on the Japanese original, since I'm really curious about it now.",6,0,0,26 June 2020
In Bruges," Superb black comedy, with the emphasis on black.
","This is a brilliant, essentially flawless movie--really cinema raised up to the level of true art and poetry. So why aren't I rating it a full ten? Because while I like black comedies, and this definitely qualifies as one of the best, it was just too grim for me, at least on the night I watched it. Everything about this movie is really great, but it is really black, and not in a playful or tongue-in-cheek way, but in a very dark contemplative fashion. The comedy is pretty good but only interspersed here and there, and is not a dominant part of this movie. Without a doubt this is a superb movie, but it is essentially a serious, sort of philosophical movie with a fair amount harsh and realistic violence. As long as you know what you are getting yourself into, you'll likely enjoy this movie, but be forewarned, it is much more black than comedy.",9,0,0,11 May 2015
Wind River," Conventional, predictable, but excellent cinematography and solid.
","Overall, nothing really new in 'Wind River', although the outstanding scenery all by itself makes it arguably worth the watch. The entire story is well-trod ground with minimal originality; however, all of the acting is much better than workmanlike, and, again, it's mostly filmed out in nature at it's finest. The dialogue is quite heavy-handed, unsubtle, and melodramatic, which, aside from the lack of fundamental originality, is my biggest problem with this film. I don't necessarily expect a murder mystery to be light and witty, but this script was too much nonstop preaching from beginning to end. In the end, if you're looking for a solid, conventional murder mystery with very high production values, 'Wind River' might not be a bad choice. On the other hand, this film will never be a classic, because it doesn't bring anything significantly new to the table at all (and it's not like I missed the Native American element either, as if that were even somehow possible given that it's hammered into your head in a such a blunt fashion).",5,1,2,7 September 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Let It Bleed.
","In my humble opinion, Quentin Tarantino has only made three really good films (although I have yet to see 'Death Proof'): 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jackie Brown', and now 'Inglorious Basterds'. While indisputably a strong film, this film gets dropped a notch or two relative to other two, because, although it's exceptionally slick and well-made, it's likewise simple-minded and undemanding. We all know that Tarantino likes violence a lot and will find any excuse to depict it. He'll always claim artistic pretensions, but actually he just really, really likes to see people suffer and bleed. While he won't be honest about it, the rest of us can be. 'Pulp Fiction' had some heavy violence, but wasn't too harsh, and 'Jackie Brown' was nearly devoid of violence by Tarantino standards; on the other hand, I found some of the violence in 'Inglorious Basterds' to be somewhat disturbing, although, admittedly, it would be quite unexceptional for a modern horror movie. More disturbing to me is that I found it only somewhat disturbing. If this movie had come out in the 1970s, it would no doubt have gotten an X rating for violence, but our culture has gotten utterly inured to this kind of thing, which might not be totally healthy (just saying). If you can get past the violence (likely not hard for most people nowadays), this movie is totally captivating and never flags from beginning to end. It's never dull, and you can't believe that 2 1/2 hours have passed when it's over. Lacking spoilers, a brief summary is that it's an alternative fictional history of WWII, which plays like a live action adult graphic novel with the expected minimal depth, subtlety, ambiguity, or moral or intellectual complexity. It's a flawless homage to classic B-movie, ultra-violent, grindhouse fare. At the same time, it's also like one of those restored cars that are way nicer than they ever were when they originally left the factory. They don't make them like they used too, at least not in this case, they do a much better job.",8,0,0,16 June 2015
World War Z," Pretty much as mindless as a zombie.
","This movie is like an ocean 10,000 miles wide and 1/16 of an inch deep. The zombies are really pretty terrifying, as far as these things go, and the movie looks like it had infinite dollars poured into it, but there is nothing here of substance at all. I haven't read the book, but if any poor school child had to write a report on this film, drawing some important lessons from it, I'd love to read it, because I couldn't find anything of value in this film to save my life. It might not reflect well on our society that we are willing to drop a zillion dollars making such unbelievably mindless fluff as this, but then I'm sure that a lot of people would say I'm just being a humorless killjoy or something like that. The upside, I suppose, is that if you are looking for a non-stop, action-packed, ultra-slick, popcorn movie and don't mind huge doses of realistic violence, this movie might be right for you. I would say it's a lot like most amusement park rides--basically purposeless, but many people enjoy them nonetheless. To each their own, I guess, but I absolutely guarantee you that this movie makes no intellectual demands whatsoever, which disappointed me because I thought it was marketed as a thinking-persons zombie flick--probably my bad for being dumb enough to believe that such a thing existed.I, personally, feel a little bit sick that I spent 2 hours watching this, much like I did when I was a kid and ate way too much Halloween candy. I'm going to have to aim for something more nutritious from Netflix next, as penance for this monster helping of cinematic junk food.",6,0,1,11 May 2015
The Hunger Games," I guess this proves I'm not a teenage girl.
","I really wanted to like this, but it was a serious letdown. I never read the book, so I can't comment on it's veracity to the source material, but as a movie, the acting is flat, the jerky camera movements were nauseating, and the material is highly, highly derivative (The Lottery, Lord of the Flies, Battle Royale, a bunch of old-time Star Trek Episodes, Death Race, The Running Man, countless other dystopian sci-fi stuff, and so on). While the utter lack of originality is very disappointing, I do give it extremely high marks for production values. The only really novel aspect of this action film is how directly and manipulatively targeted it is to teenage girls--unfortunately, I am not a teenage girl, so I just couldn't really get into it. I'm used to stuff manipulatively targeted to teenage boys, or at least those with the minds of teenage boys (like me sometimes, I suppose). As hackneyed and littered with convenient and predictable plot devices as this material is, I'd still bet that is very successful with its target audience. I'm not going to make any nasty comments about teenage girls, but there is no possible way I will be watching any sequels.",5,0,1,11 May 2015
12 Monkeys," Thinking persons time travel Sci-Fi
","I first saw 'Twelve Monkeys' when it was freshly released. I was totally confused and couldn't follow the plot at all, even though I wasn't that young. I thought it was total nonsense, and, since I well-educated in the sciences, I just generally considered time-travel plots to be tripe.Wow, how things change with time. I really get the movie this time around, and, very surprisingly, because of the way that time travel is used in the plot, I think that element of the movie worded brilliantly well. This is just a super strong film for which Bruce Willis is perfectly cast (like most movie stars, they only really 'work' in a limited number of roles). To me the only thing that puts me off a bit is that they seem to have raided most of the set and the same make-up artists from 'Brazil'. It's not that the movie was really hurt with this apparent economy, but that it could have benefited from a little bit more originality in these elements. Still, I'm really just picking nits.Initially, I was going to just write off this film and not watch it again, but I' super glad that I didn't do that. What's more embarrassing is that I was watching the movie with a guy well into his social security years who's really into Sci-Fi and he didn't have any problem following the plot at all. Makes me feel like a moron. Still a great movie, although I might not be the genius I like to think I am. In an event, if Sci-Fi is your thing, I can't recommend this brain-twister high enough.",10,1,1,7 September 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Just like the country song goes (at least how I remember it): You just can't find an editor when you need one most.
","So you know where I'm coming from, I'm not a trekkie and I'm not a fanboy. I like sci-fi, but am not crazy about comic books or movies based on them. I grew up on the original Star Trek, but never really watched or cared for the newer versions or spin-offs. My biggest criticism of this film is that while the special effects were pretty spectacular, it seems like Abrams was so enamored with his ability to do cool visual things, that he just couldn't stop making the movie. I would have rated this film much higher if they would have edited out 25-30 minutes, but as it is, it doesn't have the script to merit its length. Also, especially towards the end, the blatant disregard for basic laws of physics and increasingly ridiculous acts of physical ability became so absurd that it was nearly impossible to 'suspend disbelief.'Furthermore, it was a bit grating that all of the aliens in the movie essentially looked like human beings with very serious disfiguring diseases. How come alien life forms from all over the galaxy have bilateral symmetry with two arms, two legs, a single head and neck on their shoulders, two eyes, etc? Certainly it couldn't have been the special effects budget that spawned such biologically impoverished extraterrestrials. Most of all though, this movie suffers from a major case of bloat. I really liked the film through the first half, but kept stopping it in the last half just to see how much was left--I couldn't believe it when I stopped it near the end there was still 21 minutes to go. At that point, I'd had enough and just wanted it to end. Don't they have editors in Hollywood?",6,1,5,11 May 2015
Green Room," Really solid thriller, but don't go looking for a horror movie here.
","A lot of people seem to consider this a horror movie, which generally aren't my favorite kind of films; however, 'Green Room' is much more accurately termed a thriller with some pretty gruesome special effects tossed into the mix. I should probably only have given this 'small' film six stars, but one of my most important criteria for a viewing experience is that the film feel at least somewhat unique, which this film well-managed to do. I'm not exactly sure what else to compare it to, and I've watched everything from nature documentaries to 'chick flicks' to horror franchises. 'Green Room' starts rolling from the start, steadily builds up steam, doesn't take any easy ways out with the plot, and doesn't overstay it's welcome with too long a run time. Patrick Stewart though really seemed to be slumming and only in for the paycheck, since his performance wasn't particularly compelling versus the rest of the cast, yet he probably got paid as much as all of the others put together. So if you're looking for a 'different' kind of thriller, you could give this short, noisy, and violent film a shot, just remember, it's absolutely not a horror movie.",7,0,3,15 August 2019
Knives Out," Modern take on fun, old-time, somewhat campy murder mystery, albeit with Craig hamming it up a bit excessively
","'Knives Out' is an entertaining film, a clear take-off on old-time Agatha Christie productions and such, except by three quarters the way through I had it figured out. This one has more than enough clues that if you're paying attention, you'll probably figure it out too if you grew up reading Agatha Christie. The only thing is that I think there's one last bit that isn't spelled out at the very end, but I don't want to spoil this enjoyable film. I'll let you decide for yourself if the mystery is 'fully solved' at the very end. I don't have anything really negative to say about this film, other than that Craig seems so desperate from getting away from playing James Bond, that he went a bit too far in a campy, hammy direction that annoyed me a small amount (not anywhere near enough to wreck the film for me though). I'd encourage pretty much anyone to give this film a go, and considering the world we we're living in, I'd have to say it's pretty family-friendly on top of everything else too.",7,1,1,17 April 2020
The Fifth Element," Quite possibly the best bad 'major motion picture' ever made.
","With most films, if you really stop and consider them closely, their plots are full of holes; however, 'The Fifth Element' is very different, because it is basically huge holes strung together by some plot elements. Even by the standards of 2019 the visuals are still quite good, and there are a few humorous scenes, but, as a story, it makes no sense whatsoever. This is my third viewing of this movie since it came out. I just wanted to watch it once more to confirm that it was as bad as I remembered it to be. And, yes, it's really that bad, and, like an awful car wreck, it's hard to stop watching, even though it borders on being painfully long. Bruce Willis, as expected, simply continues to build vast wealth playing to type--his acting range being so narrow you could shave with it. The best reason I can think of recommending this film is its bizarrely revered cult status, and its being unintentionally so bad on such a big budget. It's worth seeing at least once for these reasons alone. In my opinion, it easily ranks in the top 10 of big budget 'So Bad They're Good Movies'. Watching it three times though, I've got to admit, is some form of madness.",5,2,6,1 August 2019
Hot Fuzz," Schizophrenic but very entertaining.
","I'm not really sure how to review this schizophrenic send-up of buddy-cop movies. It's somewhat disjointed and goes off in a million different directions pulling in references from tons of action movies and even a few horror movies, frequently shifting from satire, comedy and spoof to near drama and back again. Many of the lines and scenes are hilarious, and, while the violence is actually pretty graphic and realistic, at the same time it is over-the-top and cartoonish, so it isn't very disturbing. All-in-all an odd action-comedy that while not quite hitting the bullseye, is well worth watching if you're into quirky films or British comedies.",9,0,0,3 May 2015
Insomnia," A solid 10, at least until I see the original foreign production.
","I think that it is a mistake to do like I did and watch this movie well into the early morning hours right before going to bed--it's just too psychologically disturbing, or at least it was for me. With regard to the performers, while it doesn't seem like that nice a thing to say coming so soon after Robin Williams truly tragic demise, his real forte was playing seriously creepy guys, as he does so convincingly here. Al Pacino, whose normal mode is painful and ridiculous overacting, restrains his natural inclinations well and turns in a great performance, one which really captures the claustrophobia of his character's situation. Hilary Swank is also at the top of her game, and Christopher Nolan as the director creates the perfect mood for this unsettling film. The only thing that might bring this down from a perfect 10 is if I get the chance to watch the original foreign movie on which this remake is based, since experience tells me that it will almost certainly better yet.",10,0,2,10 May 2015
Cloverfield," A classic in the 'found footage' monster/horror genre, which will determine how you feel about it.
","'Cloverfield' is a truly top-notch monster/horror film in the 'found footage' genre, which means you're probably going to love it or hate it. I enjoy all kinds of films, although horror isn't my favorite film type. The biggest problem I had with the film was that the protagonists were a bunch of smug, spoiled, young, New York, hipsters. I never felt particularly emotionally invested in their fates, because in real life I tend to find these kinds of people to be aggravating and self-important. To my way of thinking, in this film a bunch of people at the top of the metaphorical food chain get to experience what it's like not to be at the actual bottom. Setting aside those admittedly snide remarks, I still found this film to be a compelling film experience, and, as an added bonus, the run-time was about perfect. So, if you're into the 'found footage' stuff, you owe it to yourself to see this one, but if that kind of film only makes you nauseous, there's nothing here that you haven't seen in any number of monster movies before, just shot from a different perspective. I'll leave it up to you.",8,0,0,27 June 2020
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A psychological, not an action, thriller.
","Really nicely done but maybe much too light on action for a lot of modern audiences. They must have poured a fortune into the sets, the period cars, etc. and every penny showed--it was simply luscious. As far as the story, I can't remember if I ever read the book, and while I saw the earlier adaptations, I can't remember them well enough to compare and contrast this version with those older ones. In any event, I feel that this production can definitely stand on its own, and I like movies that take their time and aren't just 'wham, bam, thank you ma'am,' so the languid pace was just fine with me. Be forewarned though, that this is mostly a psychological talking movie with only occasional little spurts of action. I don't know or can't recall the original source material, but I strongly suspect that the minor homosexual side stories were added to make the movie seem more contemporary and up-to-date, and I'm not sure if I really care. I guess this modern twist didn't hurt, but it didn't really seem to add anything either. So, overall, a slow but worthwhile and pleasant ride, something that is hard to find in modern cinema.",9,1,1,3 May 2015
The Adventures of Tintin," Remember when you were a kid? Me neither, but now I do a little bit.
","This is not aimed at adults. I'm a guy, and I watch movies aimed at adults (sometimes maybe even literally--too much tmi there, no doubt); yet I still have to give 'The Adventures of Tintin' very high marks. One way to put it is that the animation is as clever as 'Sin City', but the mood is the polar opposite. I strongly dislike excessively pollyannaish films, since they don't at all reflect the world I seem to be living in. This is why I don't much care for Spielberg movies, which always seem to spring from the mind of a simple-minded, optimistic, eunuch. I hardly read any Tintin growing up, so I'm no fanboy and could care less if it followed the source material well or not. This was just a really well-made, fun, PG movie that parents can safely watch with children without worrying about moments of uncomfortable blushing. Surprisingly, I'm not at all embarrassed or ashamed to admit that I really enjoyed it. Simply put, the family-friendly story was satisfying enough, the run-time wasn't excessive, and the visuals are frankly fantastic. I would tire quickly if I watched too much uncomplicated 'feel-good' stuff like this, but every now and then, a little bit of it might do the mind good.",8,0,0,28 September 2018
Snatch," How 'bout some cheesecake?
","The famous cognitive scientist Steven Pinker believes that music is mental 'cheesecake', that is, human minds just happen to like music purely as an accident due to other truly necessary evolved mental traits. If that is so, this film can probably also be considered more 'cheesecake', since it is about as close to pure entertainment as I can imagine getting. I pity the person who has to discern a moral or life lesson from this story, because if you can find one, you're probably wearing a tin foil hat; however, this film is compelling, fast-moving, witty, and clever (not to mention, violent), although it seems very much aimed at a male audience, given a complete absence of significant female characters. This film is very much the guy equivalent of the notorious and legitimately feared 'chick flick', although the plot is significantly less predictable (and less hackneyed, in this case). The way I'm going to rationalize this is that a piece of cheesecake now and again is fine, it's just not the thing you want to base a nutritious diet on.",10,0,3,5 June 2015
Scary Movie 2," For what it means to be, it does a perfect job.
","This was coming off of streaming, which motivated me to give it a try. Frankly, I was expecting this to be way too juvenile to stomach, but I wound up being pleasantly surprised. Yes, it is crude and raunchy with strong teenager appeal, but it was also reasonably intelligent and quite entertaining, as long as you get the jokes and references. No way is anything like this ever going to win an Oscar, but some (most?) nights that's not what you are looking for anyway. This movie was perfectly fit for purpose, so, and I can't believe I'm doing this, I'm giving it a perfect ten.",10,0,2,10 May 2015
Final Destination 2," Strong sequel, but still not the original.
","You discover that 'Final Denstination 1' is woven into 'Final Destination 2' as the latter film moves along. It doesn't have quite the acting chops or the plot twists of the original, but it is more gruesome--more horror, less emotion. Still, binge watching the first three 'Final Destinations' is a fine way to kill time, although they go down in quality with each remake. I don't like to put true spoilers in my reviews, so I don't want to say anything except that this picks up some of the older characters and plot lines to go in a very different direction with a weaker but still workable plot and decent-enough actors. Nothing great here, but no time-numbing waste of time either. Good, not great film.",7,2,2,31 July 2019
The Town," Crime is grimy.
","I'm going to be unpopular and rain on this parade.The lead characters in 'The Town' are all highly unlikable people that pretty much nobody with any sense would actually want to be around in real life. If you pay enough attention to the news, you'd know that Ben Affleck's narcissistic, smarmy, manipulative, psychopathic character (and that's what it really is in hard terms), isn't even acting, but it's the way he is in real life, not just in 'reel' life. So, at least, Affleck has his particular character pinned down tight.All of the acting performances are solid and the plot isn't bad--my big problem is that I never found myself rooting for any of these anti-heroes, not even once, and not even a little bit. I'm not talking about physical characteristics when I say that this is an ugly, grimy, crew of vicious criminals. I'm not being all namby-pamby about this--I've seen and enjoyed tons of violent entertainment, but I found these 'lead' characters to be particularly revolting and unrelatable.I guess our society has become so enamoured of 'winners' that even extraordinarily unappealing human beings are appealing when they win. There's no other way that I can explain the high marks for this film. Personally, when I want to see people that are just behaving out-and-out bad, I simply watch some kind of a horror/thriller movie. I won't quite say don't sacrifice two hours of your life to this film, since it's very slick, non-stop entertainment, and you could do worse, but, by the end, I personally was only feeling empty and dirty. Therefore, I'm marking it down some and reaching for the soap. Maybe I'm getting old or something.P.S. Possibly this film could be part of a 'scared-straight' program, given that if there's one thing it doesn't do is make crime look glamorous.",5,4,6,14 July 2019
Shutter Island," Well-done, but predictable from the beginning, except the twist at the very end.
","'Shutter Island' is a mystery movie that I'd put off watching for a long time. As a person, I find DiCaprio beyond insufferable. Therefore, I tend to hold off on watching his films, even though I have to admit he's been in a few I'd call good or better.In the case of 'Shutter Island', the basic plot premise turns out to be one that's very old and hackneyed by now. On the positive side and unsurprisingly, this film has very high production values, but is still just a tired riff. The plot moves along in a predictable manner, except for the twist at the extreme end, which did catch me by surprise. Still, two hours of film time to get to this one moment wasn't worth it at all. At least this film confirms my bias against DiCaprio, so I can't call it entirely a loss.",5,1,5,19 August 2019
Burn After Reading," Entertaining in an odd way, but not as great as it seemed way back when
","I watched 'Burn after Reading' when it first came out and remember thinking how funny and clever it was; however, for me, a decade later it just doesn't seem as special, unlike say 'Fargo' by the Coen brothers. 'Burn after Reading' is still much better than most films, but now it seems to meander too much, move in fits and starts, and just generally doesn't seem to flow very well. Again, I don't want to say it's not a fun movie, since the Coen brothers on their worst day are miles ahead of Michael Bay on his best, but it just isn't up there with their best work. Still, I get very tired of special effects driven films, and thankfully this is nothing like that at all. I suppose you could say its absence of a strong plot is part of its plot, which you'll understand after you watch this film. I'm still giving it seven stars, although that's probably a little bit of a stretch. I encourage anybody who wants to watch an odd movie to give this one a shot.

Wanted," Gets and extra star or two for catching me off guard
","As I understand it, 'Wanted' is based on a comic book or a book or some kind. I am not familiar with the printed work--I've only just watched the movie.The film starts off super strong and compelling, but as it goes on, it increasingly proceeds in fits and starts, albeit often violent ones. The special effects are very good, and for me at least, the story was pretty much completely off the wall, which is why I'm being charitable and giving it an extra star or two. There is no way I'm going to claim that I knew where this story was going or that I saw any of it coming, which I really liked and allows me to mostly forgive the herky-jerkiness of the plot.In the end though, I felt that 'Wanted' was mostly a triumph of style over substance, and I doubt I'll remember it very well pretty soon. It goes without saying that it ends with an action movie blow-out fight, although it was satisfyingly untypical. As I mentioned earlier, because it's at the unique end of the plot spectrum, it's sneaking by with an extra star or two. I've simply seen so many movies, of which a large number are nothing more rehashes of plots that have been done to death, that I almost automatically bump up the rating of any film that seems to offer something new or unexpected. I'd call 'Wanted' a flawed gem, and I have no regrets about watching it; however, it's a long, long way from being any kind of a masterpiece.",7,0,1,1 September 2019
Disturbia," I'm sure it's sacrilegious, but I'm a long way from being a teen and think it's better than the original 'Rear Window'
","'Disturbia' is a modern take on Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window', and it seems as if it's been updated to appeal to a teen audience; however, I found it so successful that I liked it better than the original, and I'm no teen.This film builds steam slowly, always effectively suspends disbelief, and eventually reaches a perfect crescendo. I watched it with a friend who is even older than me (been collecting social security for quite a while now) and he also found it suspenseful and compelling (unless he wasn't being honest with me).This updated 'Rear Window' felt much more real and less stilted and wooden than the original, although, of course, it is a bit more gruesome, as can be expected from a modern movie. People who don't like this either don't remember what it was like to be a teenager or, maybe, they were one of those rare ones who sailed easily through those years. I'm giving it a full 10 stars because even though it's long, I never wanted to speed it up and I was fully involved the whole way through.",10,2,4,15 March 2020
Now You See Me," Better than 'Ocean's Whatever', but went a bit too mystical
","'Now You See Me' worked out well as entertainment for a wide-ranging group of people. It's basically a complex heist flick, but it has an underlying mystical bent to it. More rationality and less 'woo-woo' would have been a major improvement in my opinion. Still that irrational part of this film was not overpowering for most of the film, and it's production values and acting are high enough that one can easily suspend belief, even though you know better. So, it worked well for a very mixed group, but I wish they just didn't take any easy 'spiritual' way out at all anywhere in the film. That might just be a personal preference though, and maybe many people prefer it this way.",7,0,1,21 March 2020
District 9," Minor quibbles aside, still the best Sci-Fi movie I've ever seen
","I can't think of any Sci-Fi movie that I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot, including all the famous one) that I'd rate as highly as 'District 9'. It has a perverse, twisty, original, and unpredictable plot that made the nearly two hours fly by. Obviously its budget was only decent, not blockbuster level, which actually enhanced the emotional effect. The plot is layered with philosophical, moral, and political complexity--pretty blatantly, at least in my opinion, successfully riffing off apartheid, Nazi medical experiments, the ongoing slaughter of albinos in Africa for witchcraft purposes, African politics, and more. My only significant quibbles are that the overall body plan of the aliens was too humanoid, as was too much of their behavior (although these two factors were probably intentional and part of a larger point that was trying to be made about 'different' people), and, after showing a reasonable amount of restraint throughout the film, it almost appears as if they called in Michael Bay to produce the grand finale. Still, all things considered, these issues to me were only minor, and this film is my personal new high-water mark for Sci-Fi.",10,3,4,10 February 2020
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Really, what were you expecting?
","I think it kind of made sense. This is a new phenomena for Mission Impossible movies. Tom Cruise is no doubt insane, which is a good thing because otherwise we probably couldn't have gotten him on the outside of the world's tallest skyscraper. Regardless of what you think of him (he is insane by the way), it was a pretty nervy move. As expected, numerous laws of physics are broken and the mission turns out not to be impossible after all. You know what you are supposed to be getting from this film and it delivers. I truly hate this saying, but in this case, it is just so right--it is what it is.",7,0,2,12 May 2015
It Follows," Cool 1980s vibe, but that's about it to me
","'It Follows' was coming off of streaming so I thought I should give it a go. After reading a lot of reviews, I really wanted to like this horror flick; unfortunately, that's not how it turned out. The first 20 or so minutes were pretty good, but then it just got slow and dumb. I guess, when you really think about it, most horror movies don't really make much sense, it's just particularly obvious in this case. I agree with other viewers who thought it had a kind of cool '80s vibe, but that's about the best I can say about it. In the end, there was no way that I was going to sit through the whole thing, so I fast-forwarded here and there to see if it got any better, but it didn't. I'm not a big horror fan anyhow, and I guess that this is comparatively original plot to most, but it just gets slower and dumber as it goes along, with a few interesting subtexts.",4,1,2,10 May 2020
Django Unchained," Maybe Tarantino should just stop talking about retiring and actually do it.
","I really hate to rain on the parade of positive reviews, but I want my 2 1/2 hours plus back. First, it is way too long. Second, I watched this right after an excellent foreign movie, and the contrast in the acting didn't favor this experience. As usual, most American movie stars don't really act, so much as just repeat the same bit in all of their movies--in other words, Jamie Foxx was Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio was Leonardo DiCaprio, and that's that. They just basically play themselves, as opposed to occupying the character. It didn't help that Tarantino cast himself in a small part. He is not a good actor, but he didn't seem that bad compared to the others, which says something unfortunate about his fellow thespians in this production. Except for the costumes, all of the characters just seemed to be lamely pretending to be from the civil war period. In spite of what some ill-informed people have claimed, nobody should confuse this movie with history. Third, I realize that this was supposed to be a homage to B movies with some irony thrown in, but these ambitions totally fail, and it just wound up playing like a B 'B movie'. It is easily Tarantino's worst movie. I get the feeling that this was Tarantino's attempt to show how much he really cares about injustice or society or something pretentious like that while still making one of his trademark films, but in reality this film is just a sloppy, self-indulgent mess. At the very least, please Quentin, if you don't follow through on your threat to retire, in the future stay behind the camera, not in front of it. You'll be doing all of us a big favor.",2,14,21,10 May 2015
Hellboy," Spectacular Visual Effect, Absurdly Simple-Minded and Cliched Plot, But What'd You Expect From A Violent, Adult, Live-Action Cartoon
","I couldn't take my eyes off of 'Hellboy' throughout the entire movie. The visual effects are just so striking. The plot is another throwaway good-vs-evil thing with one cast of misfits saving the world (or, in this case, 'The Universe') from another. I think it's also trying to be say something about fate vs. free will or something along those lines, but anything it has to say in this regard wouldn't even rate a 'C' in a freshman college writing or philosophy class. At core, it's story-telling as it's been done since the beginning of time-- good guys fighting bad guys. Why do bad guys exist? What's the nature of good? What's the nature of evil? So on and so forth. None of this matters for this film.It's pure popcorn entertainment with unusual, flawless, and spectacular special effects. 'Hellboy' is intended to fully arouse your limbic system, while your pre-frontal cortex slumbers. Don't watch it if this isn't your kind of thing, because it's no more than exactly what it promises to be. As long as you know go in with the proper expectations (simply watch the trailer), you shouldn't be disappointed.",7,1,2,28 March 2020
The Game," The trials and tribulations of drowning in money.
","'The Game' plays about as well in today's world as 'Let them eat cake' did in Marie Antoinette's. I just can't bring myself to care about Michael Douglas's investment banker character who lacks nothing in the material world but apparently needs to have ungodly millions spent on him to open his eyes to life again. Poor guy. It also doesn't seem that Michael Douglas cares much about the character either, since there is nothing particularly engaging about his acting; on the other hand, to be fair, Michael Douglas pretty much never does anything except play Michael Douglas, so what can we really expect. Sean Penn is superb at being super annoying, but then we all know that's not really acting either. The premise is that friends or loved-ones pay a company to subject ultra high net worth clients to bizarrely complex, supremely dangerous, and highly improbable games in which they're pushed up to and beyond their physical and mental limits. It's supposed to be good for them. In reality, the various kinds of trauma this would produce would inevitably lead to huge lawsuits and significant jail time for the perpetrators. It didn't even look to be the slightest bit fun or spiritually enlightening as a movie, never mind in real life. I kept thinking that maybe this was all going to play out as some kind of supernatural horror story along the lines of 'Angel Heart' (which was truly horrifying), but instead this plot was somehow supposed to be possible. You simply cannot suspend disbelief with this film. In reality, Michael Douglas would be dead 100 times over, so the fact that the story was somehow supposed to happen completely killed the whole experience for me. And finally coming back to the beginning of my review, this film was made in 1996. The world has changed a lot since then. The gap between the haves and have-nots is now a yawning chasm, and when you imagine the preposterous level of financing the company behind 'The Game' would have required to 'awaken' its super-spoiled clients, the whole theme of the movie doesn't play well today. It's like, 'Oh, you poor dear, you really had to make do with $10,000 a bottle wine. How did you ever survive?' Especially after all of the twists were revealed at the bitter end, I was only left feeling that I couldn't have cared less if every character in the movie had died a violent, horrible death. All of these insufferables would have been 'friended' by the guillotine not so long ago in history. Therefore, other than excellent production values, no other values of any kind in this movie. I really wish I hadn't fallen for the high rating on this movie, so I gave it one star rather than the two I'm more inclined towards in a futile effort to bring the rating down a little bit.",1,4,6,30 September 2018
Men in Black II," Cynically cashing in on the original.
","Really lame and disappointing. Clearly made to cash in on original. Had only a few good lines and scenes in the entire movie. Thirty or forty years ago a movie like this would have been able to fly on its spectacular special effects alone, but nowadays that's not enough, and special effects is all this movie has going for it. Aside from Tommie Lee Jones scene-stealing, the best thing that can be said about this film is that it's short enough so that you don't feel you've lost too much of your life watching it, but, seriously, don't waste your time.",3,3,5,11 May 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Come on, if this isn't a ten, what is?
","Getting right to the point, this is brilliant. Subtitles don't bother me at all--I can read. I can't imagine why anyone would watch anything other than the extended edition from the comfort of their home. I doubt I'll ever watch the Daniel Craig production, since inevitably it will be slick and over-produced with too much action (although this version is hardly lacking) which will spoil the atmosphere--Hollywood botches all adaptations from foreign source material. I read almost all nonfiction nowadays, but I do read the reviews of nearly all popular books to stay in the loop. I understand why this trilogy was such a hit in the book form. I wonder if the author, had he lived, could ever have repeated this success, since it seems to be such a singular achievement. The film has only one slightly sour point in my view, which may actually be a positive. Specifically, if I didn't know better, I would swear that radical feminists were behind this film. I'm a heterosexual male, and I realize that a lot modern entertainment is frequently criticized as being misogynist, which is likely true, although I am probably not the best judge of that. This film, on the other hand, seems to have a very strong anti-male bias to it. There are really no foul female characters in it, but, when it comes to the 'bad' male characters, they are downright vile. There are, of course, some 'good' males in the film too, but the bad ones are really, really repugnant. Makes me feel kind of slimy just being a guy. I expect women are yelling, ''You go girl!' I suppose some people (radical feminists) would argue that this just reflects reality. While obviously I've got rather personal objections to that, it's not bad to see women get in a few swings of their own. In summary, this very well-made, very feminist film with a very physically and very intellectually competent non-stereotypical multi-dimensional female lead character is very fresh and very welcome--that's a lot of verys, but it earned them all.",10,0,2,11 May 2015
Dumb and Dumber," Much, much better than I expected.
","Really high-quality low-quality humor. I had been avoiding this movie for a long time, since I expected it to be way too childishly raunchy; however, given that it was coming off of streaming and it was a Farrelly production, I thought that I should at least give it a shot. I'm really glad I did. While it's certainly a bit crude and then some in parts, it's not so much so that most women will be very offended, especially since men are typically the butt of the jokes. And what's really great about the humor is that they seldom go for the obvious expected punchlines, keeping you off-balance and guessing. It's simply good, dumb fun which is surprisingly unpredictable and well done.",9,1,2,3 May 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Too much blood for me--I've got a high tolerance for the stuff, but I'm not a vampire.
","First off, I'm not writing a review for each 'Volume' of 'Kill Bill'. I'm guessing that most people are going to be like me and watch the whole thing straight through, since it's really one continuous movie. Second, this is the second time I've seen both of them together. If I would have rated it after the first time I watched them, I would have given them a 4, but now I'm upping it to a 6. Disturbingly, I'm probably just getting inured to violence in our world (both fictional and nonfictional). There is absolutely no denying that 'Kill Bill' is an ultra-stylish film. If you're not such a fanboy that you can't divide Tarantino films into good ones and bad ones, this would definitely fall on the good side of the ledger. But you can never forget that this is a Tarantino film, and it's the bloodiest one that I can think of off hand. I don't mean buckets of blood, I mean Olympic-sized swimming pools of the red, gooey stuff. I know that to some degree, this film is tongue-in-cheek, and, also, that it is an homage to certain films of the past, but for me personally, the gore eventually drowned everything else out. Tarantino likes to claim that he isn't out to glorify violence, but this film puts paid to that nonsense. This is 4 hours of nearly non-stop, bright neon-lit, high-decibel, advertising advocating violence. Nobody is going to be convincing me that Tarantino doesn't have some serious psychological issues, although I'll leave that to others to speculate what those might be. Still, if you want to watch Tarantino at his bloodiest and in near perfect form, you should add this one to your 'must-see' list (as opposed to misfires like 'Django Unchained' and 'The Hateful Eight'). I wouldn't be surprised if my stomach is just a bit weak compared to the average movie watcher, and this film won't bother most people at all, which kind of bothers me.",6,0,1,27 May 2019
Mission: Impossible II," I've already almost forgotten it.
","Totally average Tom Cruise action-adventure with passable plot and expected high production values. Keeps moving and holds attention but is pure entertainment junk food and it isn't even a little bit filling. These 2 hour Mission Impossible films don't really seem to have much more plot to them than the old 50 minute TV series did, and it bugs me that they are just Tom Cruise vehicles, whereas the original series was more interesting because it used an ensemble cast--Peter Graves was not all there was. Also it was annoying how much physical punishment Tom Cruise can take and still keep moving effectively--I know this is supposed to be over-the-top, but it was way, way too much over-the-top here. Overall, I kind of wished I hadn't wasted 2 hours on this, but in the end I'll know doubt watch all of the Mission Impossible Movies-- the first one made no sense, the fourth was pretty solid, this one was disposable, so I guess that only leaves number 3.",5,0,1,11 May 2015
Black Hawk Down," War is Hell.
","Harsh. Intense. Powerful. This movie does not make war look like fun at all. Like, I mean, not even a little bit in the least. This is utterly a top-notch production, although the plot is littered with stereotyped military characters. Individual outcomes are pretty much totally clichéd and predictable. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen to the new guy who can't wait for some action? Overall, I'd say watching this movie makes a nearly rock-solid case for shifting residence to Canada if the draft was restarted. Possibly I missed the message?",10,0,1,12 May 2015
Limitless," Slick, fun, fast-moving, light-weight Science Fiction
","Almost everyone nowadays knows that the fundamental conceit of 'Limitless', that we only use a small proportion of our brain, is well-proven scientific nonsense--the brain is the most energy-intensive organ in the body, and we don't carry around any more of it than we need; however, it's also apparent due to advances in technology and biology that we're likely moving in the direction of being able to enhance the average natural cognitive abilities of human beings, possibly even dramatically. Therefore, the premise of this movie is not completely out-and-out pseudoscience. Frankly, I'd be the first to admit that Google has significantly affected the way I actually think. Today, I try to simply remember that particular problems have well-known solutions, rather than to devoting much time to memorizing details I can quickly access.Thus, if you can forgive this movie it's one big scientifically ridiculous 'MacGuffin', specifically that a mere small pill can temporarily massively 'supercharge' any human brain, then this fast-paced thriller works extremely well and hardly ever slackens up. Nobody is ever going to mistake 'Limitless' for 'deep' science fiction, in which really difficult philosophical problems are tackled, but it's still a healthy step up from being just popcorn entertainment.I personally would like to see the central idea of this film, the consequences of human enhancement' pushed an awful lot further, but that doesn't detract from the fun of watching this slick, fun, and well-acted production. We'll have to wait for some other movie (far from my original thought) to thoroughly explore the idea of very different classes of 'enhanced' human beings living together in a single society (or competing societies, for that matter). While we're waiting for that movie, you can watch this one.",9,0,0,19 January 2020
Sicario," I don't really want to think about it, but maybe we do need some of that 'diversity' stuff
","I went into 'Sicario' with really high expectations and left feeling quite disappointed. Perhaps this movie has just aged really rapidly, as movies often do.I won't be writing any spoilers, but we all know that this film is based on the on-going 'Great Mexican-American Drug War'. Emily Blunt plays an FBI agent and the other Americans are a bunch of shady operatives. I'm an aging (God it hurts to admit that) American male and naturally drawn to action movies, although they're the minority of films I watch.This film starts off under a steady rain of testosterone, which keeps building steadily throughout the movie, until it's a straight-up Category 5 hurricane by the end. Basically, it's about hard men in a hard world. Playing on that theme, I expect that copies this movie are being peddled in the back of men's magazines alongside 'pheromones' and 'natural Viagra'. Way before it ended, I was overdosing. (Maybe I'm just too virile as it is and simply couldn't take any more hits, at least not without an opportunity to work it out of my system winning the Tour de France or becoming a home run king.) At least 'Mission Impossible' flicks aren't intended to be serious commentaries on society.Emily Blunt's character was a joke. I'm not that big a guy and not in the best shape of my life, but unless she's some kind of black belt, I'd rip her limb-from-limb. Playing an up-and-coming, hard-core, door-breaking, FBI agent just seemed ridiculous and there was no way to suspend disbelief on this matter. Mostly she came across as a whiny, 90 pound, teenage girl. This isn't misogyny, only the hurtful truth. Total miscasting.Still, this film's testosterone overload makes a pretty good case for all those annoying diversity activists (should have more particularly mentioned that I'm a white male--the worst kind). Quite reasonably, most of us probably don't want the anti-heroes of 'Sicario' solving the world's problems. I'm pretty certain that these 'Ultimate Men' could do no better than another 'Ultimate Solution', a bit of history best not repeated. Guys like these are the 'Typhoid Marys' of PTSD. It's like when you elect a psychopath as President--the President's just fine, it's everybody else who suffers. I never thought that I'd ever find myself using that abhorrent, simple-minded, put-down 'toxic' masculinity, but I'd consider making an exception here. Even the bits of supposed nuance in this film hit you over the head like a 20 pound sledge hammer.In the end, I'm still giving 'Sicario' 5 stars, because, at least if you're a guy, it'll almost certainly hold you attention all the way to the end. Shamefully, it did for me. Also it's a very slick production. I remain personally very disappointed though, since so many reviews implied that the plot had depth. I suppose if you're extremely unfortunate you can drown in a wading pool, but it's still not the deep end, even if you can't swim and it's really windy.",5,0,2,20 February 2020
Inside Man," Spike Lee should 'sell out' more often.
","'Inside Man' convinces me that Spike Lee would actually be a much more effective social activist if he would just get off of his insufferable soap box, stop incessantly speaking down to white people, and simply make movies showing black people every bit the equal of white people. This is really nothing more than a superior popcorn movie, but I think it's more likely to actually ease racial tensions than any of Lee's films that are much more intentionally intended to do so. I'm not even going to pretend to hide anything here. I'm a well read and educated white guy who od'd a long time ago on Spike Lee's simple-minded lectures on the problems of race relations in America and pretty much all of his associated work. Lee's interviews always seem to indicate that he believes he's making brilliant, original observations, but I've never heard him say anything that hasn't been said before. Now, on the other hand, I'm sure that Lee would say he 'sold out' when he made this big-budget, conventional, Hollywood blockbuster, even though it's leading character was Denzel Washington and other black actors played significant roles. I, on the other hand, have to say that I think it's the slickest heist movie I've ever seen, even better than 'The Usual Suspects'. It's easily my favorite Spike Lee film, and I don't think the plot made one meaningful misstep the whole time. It was never difficult to suspend disbelief, and the storyline never bogged. Simply casting black people in favorable leading roles works better with me personally than constantly hammering on me for my lack of melanin, which I get really, really tired of. In the same way that not all black people are violent, sociopathic, drug dealers, not all white people are truly deep-down racists suffering from all kinds of 'implicit' biases and relentlessly expressing 'microaggressions'. So, while overall I've had way too much of Lee's intellectually trivial sermonizing for a lifetime, and I think that nowadays he's only insincerely inflaming further racial division (as if we needed more) to further inflate his already monstrous ego (Clooney, a white guy, does the same thing using other excuses) rather than to actually benefit society, I fully endorse 'Inside Man' as the the best film of its type ever made.",10,0,1,30 September 2018
Jack Reacher," Tom Cruise doing what he does best, which isn't exactly subtle or brilliant.
","It's just a popcorn flick. You want a normal Hollywood popcorn flick, this will do. No real thought is involved--some people get hurt, some get killed, and some stuff gets blown up. You'd have to be in an altered state of consciousness to get any real deep meaning out of this film. It's basically just a male fantasy about being hyper-competent.When Jack Reacher gives his Tom Cruise-style rant about how much everybody would really live like him if they could, and you think about it for a second, you wonder how anybody could be so dumb as to suggest that or write that particular line of script. Yeah, I'd just love to be roaming the country on buses (I have a little bit of experience here and I am sure it has not gotten that much better) with a single t- shirt to my name. Great. Sign me up. Still, if you were trying to preserve neurons, you obviously wouldn't be watching this. You don't consume a milkshake with whipped cream and a cherry on top in order to drop pounds. Oops, I think I've already forgotten the plot, as if it matters.",6,0,1,12 May 2015
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Arguably 10 stars, but I'm getting older
","I saw 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' when it first came out and thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. To this day, if you were going to sit down and compose a list of the all-time best British gangster movies (and, I think, the British indisputably make the best gangster movies), this film would still rank somewhere near the top. The plot is twisty, clever, witty and chock-a-block with strangely compelling eccentric psychopaths. The production values are slick, but obviously intentionally filmed in a grimy-lens sort of manner, which very effectively captures the story's underworld atmosphere. This film also jump-started the career of a few actors in this film, most notably Jason Statham.You know how people say, 'It's not you, it's me', well, that's how I feel about this film 20 years later. As for many of us, life can be a bit tough over a 20-year time span, and this film doesn't possess one single sympathetic character. I'm not exaggerating. Not even a single teeny-tiny one (that's kind of an inside joke you'll get after watching this movie). By the time I reached the credits, I had lost complete interest in who was still living. Being a guy, I absolutely hate the phrase 'toxic masculinity', but I think that the 'bros' completely populating and dominating this entire film represent those who today's aggravatingly condescending 'woke' prudes are perpetually hectoring the rest of us about. (This movie had absolutely no female characters of any substance, which doesn't seem unusual to me for a Guy Richie production.)So it all kind of depends on what you're looking for. If you want to kick back and watch a classic British gangster film, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' remains somewhere near the top of the list, but just don't be expecting any feelings of emotional involvement, unless, I suppose, you're a psychopath, but then you wouldn't be feeling anything anyway. Still, I'm sure that this movie is just what the doctor ordered for an awful lot of people, and, sadly, I must confess to getting some guilty pleasure out of it. (Not sure why I'm confessing, since I'm not even Catholic.)",7,0,1,27 December 2019
Zombieland," Tries a little too hard to add some quirkiness and emotion to typical zombie comedy.
","To begin this short review, I'll answer one important question first. Do I regret spending my time watching this film? The answer is a definite no.'Zombieland' has a lot of good scenes and clever dialogue, but, ultimately, doesn't cohere with true brilliance. Still, I think it's a unique combination of quirkiness, comedy, emotion for a zombie film, although I'm a long ways from being an expert on the genre.Woody Harrelson plays Woody Harrelson, except that he's dialed up his usual self to around a 15 on a scale of 10, which was way too much for me and just plain annoying. (On the other hand, I'm sure that his many fans are going to have no problems with his performance at all.)In summation, I'd recommend this short, fast-paced, basically heart-warming, zombie flick to anyone who wants to kick back and kill a little time, provided the usual zombie gore doesn't bother you. At its flesh-eaten core, it's actually really all about traditional American family values, just as much as any 'Leave it to Beaver' episode ever was. I should add that while the gore is extreme, it hits you mostly like video-game stuff, rather than reality, so most people will soon get over it.",6,0,0,27 July 2019
American Made," I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but this is a good movie.
","'American Made' is based on a true story, which in Hollywood terms means that something is true somewhere in it. I do vaguely remember the Iran-Contra scandal, but I'd have to do a lot of internet research to find out which elements of the story are actually true and which are embellishments. It's just simpler not to take Hollywood seriously when they say it's a 'true story'. This is not a typical over-the-top Tom Cruise action movie, since he actually can't fix all problems with freakish super-human stunts. As a matter of fact, I can't remember the last time he has made a movie which required that he do some actual acting any more. His performance isn't inspired, but it is solid, as is the performance of everyone else in the movie. It goes without saying that production values are as good as it gets. Overall, a highly recommended film for the whole family, just don't foolishly mistake it for history.",8,2,2,29 September 2019
Sausage Party," Seth Rogen must have a death wish
","Wow. OMG. First North Korea and now, maybe, the most brutal (and definitely the most offensive) takedown of religion ever made. Seth Rogen really baits some potentially dangerous people. This kind of comedy would quite literally put your life at risk in many parts of the world currently. (Thank goodness for freedom of speech and expression, since underneath all the filth some well-known but still perceptive observations are really hammered home.) The foul language along with the sexual crudity and innuendo are so non-stop you'd have to watch this flick many, many times to catch all of it. It's a really tight script, but an adult film in every sense of the word, and I really do mean in every sense of the word. I can imagine kids wanting to watch this movie, and parents wanting to watch it, but I can't imagine either of them wanting to watch it together. I took one star off of a perfect 10 because the continuous obscenity started to exhaust me some towards the end; however, I still really liked it, and the world is a much better place for stuff like this being out there somewhere, at least as far as I'm concerned.",9,3,4,20 August 2018
American Gangster," Doubt it's really history, but as a movie, it's pretty much flawless.
","Right off the bat, I'm certain that when Hollywood says, 'based on a true story', the kernel of 'American Gansgster' might be true, but much or most of the rest is made up out of whole cloth. First off, I doubt that the main criminal character in this film was nearly as charismatic and charming in real life. I'm willing to bet that he was a clever, intelligent, manipulative, psychopath who you wouldn't want to cross in real life. People like this are much more interesting to watch in movies than to deal with in real life. I have tons of doubts about what Russel Crowe's real life 'hero' character was like too. But setting reality aside, this is pretty much a flawless movie. It's actually built around a plot with minimal special effects; the sets, cars, clothing, music, and so on are all historically appropriate with a real eye for detail; and it's simply impossible to criticize the cinematography. Many people (kids especially) may find that it's a little bit slow for them, but I often enjoy a film that takes its time and is somewhat ambiguous, both of which this film certainly is. As long as you know what to expect (specifically, a lot less violence and a lot more character development than most modern movies), this is a great film.",10,4,6,16 June 2019
Kingpin," Pretty low humor raised to a pretty high art.
","I know how insensitive it sounds, but I was thinking to myself, 'I haven't bowled in years and watching grass grow is more interesting than watching bowling. At least it's not golf. Really, how good can a comedy about a crippled bowler be?' Still, I reasoned that this film is by the Farrelly brothers and it's about to come off streaming, so at least I should give it a try. Just goes to show how wrong a guy can be. A perfect mixture of sentiment and low and somewhat higher-brow humor, not to mention flawless performances and brilliant cinematography. A totally pleasant surprise. Definitely a new American comedy classic.",10,0,2,9 May 2015
Inception," Very Good Sci-Fi with Two Big Problems
","'Inception' is a clever film on many levels (that's an inside joke to anyone who watches it), but, for me personally, it had two huge problems.First, let's start with the positives, one of which is exploring the consequences of what might be possible if it were possible to directly get into someone's mind (neuroscience is already indicating that this may be possible to some degree), along with just general philosophical questions about the fundamental nature of reality.Second, the special effects really are special throughout this entire film. They're pretty much flawless, huge in scope, and segue from scene to scene with total smoothness. Whether or not the convoluted plot actually works logically would take me hours with a white board or something to figure out. I'm assuming the screenwriters did this, and it really makes some kind of sense. Just don't ask me to explain the whole thing.Now for the two big problems for me. First, the motivation that put this hugely twisty plot into motion seemed skinnier than a skeleton. Something about energy, a white guy, and a Japanese guy. This is what you call a 'MacGuffin' in the film-making business. Old-style Jame Bond 'Hidden Volcano Island' movies used to have intrinsic motivations thousands of times more complex than this movie. I can't help but think that someone stroking a purring, fluffy, snow white cat would have added an awful lot of clarity to this film.Second, I find the presence of Leonardo Di Caprio to be a major problem in movies like this. The movie relies on us accepting that his character has deep, troubling, emotional baggage and scars. Yet, none of us can't know that in real life he's constantly flying around the world in private jets exploring super-young super models on super yachts in exotic locales, while periodically scolding the rest of us about our shameful carbon footprint, all the time leaving one behind himself that's larger than the U.S. Sixth Fleet. I simply can never suspend disbelief coming from him in this type of role where his real character is at such odds with the one he is depicting on the screen. Like Ben Affleck and a large number of today's actors, their off screen activities are so egocentric and distracting that they wind up significantly affecting how well I can forget who they are in onscreen roles.Summing it up, I'd say that 'Inception' is a slightly over-rated film, but it's still quite clever with non-stop action and continuous brainteasers. Especially if you're immune to the 'Di Caprio' effect and like Sci-Fi, this could be an excellent movie to watch. It runs for around about 150 minutes, but only feels around 120. I've put in my two cents, now it's you're call.",6,1,4,5 January 2020
Vanilla Sky," Tom really surprises me.
","Wow, I really didn't think that Tom Cruise was actually capable of carrying a heartfelt movie. My opinion is that this is the best movie Tom Cruise has made so far. I actually only decided to watch this because I'm a car guy, and I knew that this movie had a Ferrari 250 GTO in it (turns out it's a replica). Interestingly, there were also quite a few other nice classic cars in the movie, such as a 1960s fastback Mustang and a Volvo 1800ES shooting-brake. It's a well-written and complex story that comes together at the end, but I don't want to give anything away, so I'm going to stop there. Normally, Cruise is a charismatic and energetic 'Movie Star,' but not a particularly compelling or convincing actor, and until the end this formula was holding true, but then, for lack of a better word, the film blossoms. The way I would categorize this movie is that the French should have made it, but until they do, the American original will do nicely.",9,3,5,11 May 2015
Final Destination," Takes home an Oscar for teenage horror.
","Right off the bat, let me say, I'm on the far side of 50 and so not the target audience for 'Final Destination', but I thought that this was a great addition to the teenage horror/suspense genre. I really enjoyed it, because it's well-acted, well-plotted, not excessively gory, unpredictable, and even more superlative adjectives that I just can't think of at this moment. For the first 10 or so minutes, I really wasn't into it and thought that it was going to be a big let-down; however, given that it started such a successful franchise and was such a short film, I decided to stick it out. I'm really glad I made that decision, since I was rewarded with a movie that just kept building and building right into becoming a solid home run. I trying to think of something negative to say about this film, but I really can't--other than, maybe, it's hard to accept Seann William Scott as anybody other than Stifler. It's the perfect run-time and has the perfect amount of emotional content for what it's meant to be. If there were an Oscar for this type of film, it would be a strong contender, but sadly that's not how the world works. Both thumbs up for this slick supplement to this particular canon.",10,1,1,28 July 2019
Cube," Won't be watching the sequels.
","Meh. 'The Cube' offers a few interesting (although far from original) philosophical points mixed into a film that's a cross between a rather mild horror/thriller with, unfortunately, only a few humorous moments. I'll grant that it keeps trying, but it just can't seem to get up and go anywhere (which might be partly intentional). In any event, at the end, I felt like I had a somewhat interesting movie experience, although I would have watched something else if I really knew what I was getting into, and I definitely won't be watching any sequels. Really, the best I can say is that the creators at least tried something halfway original, although unfortunately not particularly satisfying. Let's just say that the souffle collapsed.",5,0,1,18 October 2018
Jackie Brown," Tarantino's best work in my opinion.
","I saw this a long, long time ago and another watching has just confirmed my viewpoint. I'm going to risk being a total heretic here, but I think that this is really Tarantino's best film ever (and, yes, that includes Pulp Fiction). First, there is violence in the film, but it is not a nonstop bloodbath, which turns me off. Second it has a very tight plot with some unexpected twists. Finally, all of the actors without exception give really strong performances. A really well-executed story which doesn't seem nearly as long as it is because it just keeps moving along.",10,5,6,11 May 2015
Sin City," Very dark adult comic book with phenomenal visuals.
","First and foremost, if it weren't for the visual effects 'Sin City' would be nowhere; however, the visuals are absolutely gripping. The material itself is dark. Not like new moon dark--more like 2000 feet below the earth cave dark. Frank Miller frankly paints an absurdly evil world, and I that I think he actually has pretensions of making some sort of points about actual life, but this film is far too extreme, simple-minded, and cartoonish to constitute a significant contribution to the western philosophical canon.. No matter how extreme the violence, and it's pretty awfully extreme, it has minimal emotional impact--it's pretty much like you're watching a movie, so to speak. If someone accused Miller of 'toxic masculinity', I wouldn't be standing up to defend him. All of the women are so hot, you'd scald yourself just brushing up against them, and all of the guys (both good and bad) work out all of their problems with extreme violence. Not really a happy place, although I do have to say an exceptionally stylish one. The plot ties together brilliantly as the film moves along well. If it could just have been edited down around another 20-30 minutes , I would have tossed it an extra star or two. Unfortunately the unrelenting bleakness just wound up overwhelming my tender.sensibilities",7,0,0,26 September 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," More of a true horror movie than most reviews let on.
","I was hoping for a horror-comedy along the lines of 'Shawn of the Dead', but instead this movie is much closer to a straight up horror movie, albeit with a clever plot and some comedic elements and witty bits. I don't care that much for horror movies, although I am up on what goes on in the genre, so I think I got all of the jokes and references in this one. It's meta and satire in the same way as the 'Scream' franchise, but I feel it was much harsher in terms of horror effects and plot. If you are into horror movies, I'm guessing that you're going to love this film, but it's just not my thing. I am still rating it highly, because I have to grant that it was very well done and an unexpected twist on conventional horror movies, and I can't quite say I regret watching it.",8,0,3,10 May 2015
Moon," Has 'Existential Angst' truly ever hit you hard?
","This film is certainly going to affect different people very differently. My review is going to go down badly with many or most people no doubt. Because I like to avoid spoilers, my reviews tend to concentrate on how they affect me emotionally rather than go into a lot of plot detail. This is, in particular, a 'feelings' review. There's a punch line, but it's a little bit of a walk first.I suffer from a serious genetic disease and am in the middle of cleaning up after an awful family tragedy. I emphatically do not believe that there is a 'Big Man in the Sky' (or even, for that matter, a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster') looking out for me or any other living thing. There exists no 'Grand Plan' that we simply can't comprehend. After all, in my case, I'd have to conclude that God really had it in for me. That's pretty much the definition of a no-win situation.I have a degree in biology (honestly a minor--just a few classes short of another major--should have just finished it, since I was always at the top of the class), and I continue to read extensively in the field. The world makes sense to me. Unfortunately, it fundamentally isn't nice. (Yes, it's not quite that simple, since human beings are highly social creatures, but I'm talking about the most basic biological level--when we're nice, it's for a reason). As a blatant example of our worst, look no further than our current alpha male President. (Admittedly a very simple evolutionary analysis, but it seems appropriate for a very simple-minded primate who does not appear capable of introspection beyond that of a nonhuman great ape. Frankly, it's an open question whether or not he even actually feels any form of personal pain, although we've got the matter of empathy fully resolved.) 'Mother Nature' is a mean old b--ch. (No misogyny intended, only playing off of an ancient, intellectually-juvenile, anthropomorphic interpretation of how the natural world operates.) We don't have to wait for 'all to be revealed'. Darwin did that quite a while back, and all we've been doing since is tidying up.If you have my biological problems and my outlook on existence, this movie might really hit you in the gut. If you've ever curled up in a ball contemplating what a brutal and lonely universe we're born into and soon pass out of, you'll totally get this film. On the other hand, if you're confident that there's some great scheme at work behind the scenes that's going to make all of the apparent human and nonhuman suffering ultimately somehow worthwhile, and you have never truly had any significant doubts about that shatter your psyche, then this film might instead seem slow and mostly hit you like water off of a duck.Who knows, as is currently popular to theorize, maybe I'm (the rest of you don't actually exist) living in some incomprehensibly-deep simulation and somebody or something is pulling strings (writing code?) and there really is some kind of plan. Or, on the other hand, my life is all some kind of cruel or meaningless entertainment. Or, on the third hand (on the internet, nobody knows you're an octopus), maybe it's really as straightforward terrible as it outright appears to be. These are the kinds of thoughts that this film reawakens, if you've ever had them. Obviously these aren't pleasant thoughts, but once you've had them, they never really leave you. That's how this film made me feel.",10,3,4,30 June 2019
