Blade Runner 2049," Great Achievement
","I've seen over 1,000 movies in my life, and I'm in my early twenties. I've seen terrible films, good films, great films and then there are the few that are just truly great achievements in filmmaking. the score for this film is one of the best I've ever heard, it is visually stunning beyond anything, and the plot that makes this one of the greatest sequels of all time. you shouldn't really see this until you've seen the original, but either way, its doesn't matter. i left the theater speechless, and that's never happened before. yes its long, but get over it. people are too used to a lot of action in movies these days. go see it, that's all i can say.",10,17,38,8 October 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A triumph
","One of Tarantino's best works, some of the greatest acting ever. Magnificent cinematography and editing. A sure fire Best Picture nominee or winner. The comedic side of it is hilarious and fun.
I've seen other reviews on here, saying it's boring with no plot. So wrong. The plot is Leo and Pitt's characters looking for work in the summer of the Manson murders in LA. And for those saying it's boring, too bad. If you are expecting all movies to action packed with little dialogue, than why are you watching movies? This film is an absolute triumph for Tarantino",10,73,123,28 July 2019
