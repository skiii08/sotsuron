Alien 3," Assembly Cut is Definitely the Way to Go!
","2003 version of the film is an excellent change of pace from the theatrical version. It added a lot of the ominous feeling of the first, while keeping the action of the second. I believe the theatrical cut was a little to contrite;basically get on the roller-coaster and push to the end credits. This version of the film is more of an experience, you enjoy and experience the film. The only negative I would say is the lack of depth in Weaver's portrayal of Ripley. Making of Alien 3 is an excellent disc included in the set. It's amazing that such a great cut was presented to Twentieth Century Fox in 1991, and was adjusted for logistical reasons, playtime, etc. The original film was truly perfect, not bad for a first time director with his first major motion picture.",Null,1,1,3 October 2011
