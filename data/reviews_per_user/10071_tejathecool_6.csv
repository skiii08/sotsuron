Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," a great sequel ,,,, satisfaction guaranteed
","SHERLOCK HOLMES (a game of shadows): normally all the sequels fall short of its ancestors ,,but believe me this movie is far great than the first one.sherlock holmes meets his exact rival as clever and cunning has himself and the story takes lots of twists and turns and a wild cat and mouse chase.dr.watson is again been very helpful to the most wisest man and both of these characters are played very nice by jude law and robert downythe background music is simply awesome and especially camera work in certain frames are simply mind blowing and you guys really get your jaw dropped by the climax i assure you",8,1,2,31 December 2011

Skyfall," prefect bond movie reaching all the expectations
","The movie is a feast for all the bond fans and on the same side non bond movie viewers too,,,,the cast remains the same mostly while daniel craig has done his character well enough along with judi dench but the show stealer remains javier bardem who is completely extraordinary with his performance.The plot is good enough than the last two bond movies and the movie remains in its pace always not making u wriggling in the seat getting u bored,, the sound track once again is very good.Coming to the cons of the movie ,,,for me bond never gets old but all through the movie i felt daniel craih very old and i think its time to get a new bond into the play and little under satisfied with the cinematography BOTTOM LINE: a complete feast for action movie lovers",7,1,8,1 November 2012
World War Z," apocalypse-zombie style
",I would call this movie in one sentence as 'apocalypse-zombie style' and here is my review:STORY AND PLOT: This movie is a sci-fi thriller with apocalypse background and zombies as a main course. though the story line is simple the script is strong enough to make this movie a thumbs up in critics and audience.CAST AND PERFORMANCES: there is nothing much to discuss in this category as the casting has been kept to minimal and the whole story revolves around the character of Brad Pitt. the characters played by his wife children and his fellow colleagues are short lived but yet they did their job in their role. and what more to say about brad as he played his role in ease .TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS: the first thing i want to speak in this category is the OST/BGM in this movie which i personally liked very much. The graphics though not very realistic can take your breath and especially eye feasting for thriller movie lovers. The rest of the technical departments has done their job well.MY ANALYSIS: this movie is a definite must see for thriller lovers but the i felt the story line similar to I AM LEGEND movie and have to see how much non thriller lovers can receive this movie.,7,3,13,22 June 2013
Man of Steel," a dark blue god
","MAN OF STEEL: Being an ardent fan of the most powerful man earth has ever seen i have been reading comics , watched cartoons and saw all the movies in the superman series i was waiting for MAN OF STEEL and once it released i was there in the theatre and now before u people with the review.PLOT AND PERFORMANCES: the movie has been scripted very nicely and though it seems a routine story for those who know about the origins of superman the essence of this movie is fresh enough. The villain is strong enough giving a good competition to the walking god on earth. Coming to performances Henry Caville has given Clark Kent a new look by his physique and mannerisms, Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner are good enough in their characters and a special reference to Michael Shannon for the General Zod character. TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS: the first applause goes to the Director Zack Snyder for giving a dark look to the always colorful Superman and the way he scripted the movie. The graphics and 3D effects mainly in the second half are simply mind blowing. BGM was little backdrop as i felt.ANALYSIS: GOOD SCRIPT, GOOD GRAPHICS , A DARK TAKING BUT WITH AN AVERAGE BGM AND CAN BECOME LITTLE BORING FOR THE SUPERMAN FANS",7,0,1,14 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," not so AMAZING though!!!!!!
","my first view after watching this movie,,,,, its not so amazing though. ya this movie has good graphics but this cant be said as a good move cos almost all the movies in Hollywood has good graphics,,, so it cant be called amazing by graphics . Next coming to story line,,,, it has the same old story with a change in the super villain ,,,,though the trailers gave a dark theme to the movie it doesn't appear so when it comes to the movie,,,,so it cant be called amazing by storyline.The next thing is the cast,,,,, first thing comes into mind for peter parker is tobey ,,,,andrew garfield doesn't fit into it,,,,,and the same goes for emma stone too,,,,, not amazing here too.Almost 3/4th of the world knows who spiderman is and what his story is,,,,, so this movie wont add any spice to the legendMY WORD: a genuine spiderman movie fan wont find any differnce in this movie",6,5,18,5 July 2012
