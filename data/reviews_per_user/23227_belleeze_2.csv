Black Swan," Excellent !!
","Words cannot describe Natalie Portman 's exceptional performance which in turn won her many awards including the well deserved Oscar and the Golden Globes to name a few. Not only did she portrayed the na√Øve childlike character Nina but at the same time excelled in her graceful performance as a ballerina as well for which she lost 20 pounds to look the part. Apart from her ballet dance classes she had when she was young, a dedicated Portman did ballet training for one year prior to shooting Black Swan. The 40 seconds long scene where she went into the toilet to call her mother with good news places her in a league of her own and did her justice as a top A Lister. Looking back at Portman's career, the dark challenging character she played in V for Vandetta does not do justice when you compare it with the character Nina. Portman told broadcast journalist Charlie Rose in an interview that one of the most difficult challenges was her childlike voice in the film which was one of the most outstanding aspects of her character performance. Mila Kunis and Wynona Rider added brilliant performance to the picture with their different characters and provided a much needed perspective on Nina's deteriorating sense of reality. Barbara Hershey provides a perfectly calculated performance as an infantilizing mother. Hats off to Darren Aronofsky for pulling a masterpiece together with his signature style shots that shows shots taken from behind the subject. There are certain aspects of Black Swan that can relate to his powerful film 'The Wrestler'(2008)which also portrays the lead struggling for excellence in his field.",10,2,4,17 November 2015
The Matrix," A Magnificent masterpiece!
","The first and only movie i ever watched back to back to date! Why i am calling this a masterpiece is for two reasons. One: The concept and script blew my mind. In a good way of course. There are so many dimensions to this concept that you can take, grasp and comprehend in so many levels, metaphorically and literally. On one hand i grasped this concept literally. The dystopian narrative which we all have already seen in movies alike; rise of the machines and war between mankind and human beings. Metaphorically speaking, the concept can be related to the top rich elite who run the world. Us, the ignorant public are just their puppets. Listen and believe all their propaganda because at the end of the day, they hold the power to do so. Media! Two: The cinematography and the groundbreaking photography techniques are just awesome. Not did it only introduce this new technique but draws the audience in and take us for a ride. One of a kind ride! I don't think any one of us who had watched matrix will ever for get the bullet scene with Keanu. All in all, kudos to the Wachowskis and Bill Pope. Forever grateful to this masterpiece. One of a kind!",10,0,0,18 March 2017
