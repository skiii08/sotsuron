Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sw:TPM you don`t have to watch it, just let it flow in you
","It`s stunning, amazing, 'unusually strong', deep, soft, fun, a smile in the face, light, epinephrine rushing, all kinds of feelings together at once...it`s really perfect. My worries about a galaxy more techno developed in the past, the Jedi much more skilled 32 years ago, rushed away from my mind as the story was being developed. Now I feel beyond the clouds, over the moon, '...in a galaxy far, far away'.",10,0,1,18 May 1999
