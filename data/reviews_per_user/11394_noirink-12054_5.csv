Hereditary," it really got to me..
","Rarely I felt so uncomfortable watching a horror movie.. I literaly had goosebumps. The movie is very slow paced. But the tension keeps growing and growing. The less you know about the premise of the movie, the better! If you like films like shining - give it a go!",7,0,1,8 September 2018
Drag Me to Hell," fun...
","I liked it. Raimi at his best. Goofy, scary and over the top. It's certainly not a master piece but If you digg movies like evil Dead 2, it's definitely worth watching. But one question remains... How the hell did they get a pg13 rating for this?!?",7,2,3,6 September 2018
Joker," it's a decent movie.
",But by far not the cineastic gem that I have expected. The story is way to formulaic to impress and its twists are therefore not very surprising. But Phoenix acting is really worth to watch it. that is it.,7,1,1,1 November 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Wow i never expected
","to be that bored in a Batman-Movie. To make it short, Affleck is really doing well as Batman, yes indeed, and Gal Gadot looks promising as Wonder Woman. But the rest of the Movie is just awfully tedious and way to serious about its laughable plot. Especially if you have read Millers Dark Knight Comics, then you know how cool the clash of those two icons could have been.But instead the viewer is left with a Batman, who's behaving incredibly stupid for the worlds greatest detective. As for superman well, he could not add much to his part. Doomsday looks like every other generic mutant from today's id-shooter-games. Eisenbergs Lex Luthor is just annoyingly overacted. And those awkward dream scenes and scenes who are purely inserted for further Sequels, are making no sense and slowing the movie further down. For me, those scenes where the ultimate nail in the coffin. Left me with the feeling to sit through a film made by a group of marketing executives, not by a decent director or screenwriters.Of course, there are some cool scenes but they are not saving this sinking ship of a movie. Pity. I was looking forward to this movie and i wanted to like it.",3,2,3,2 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," And the Universe of Alien is shrinking furthermore...
","This movie makes Prometheus look like a philosophical piece of art.By all its flaws and awkward moments it's difficult for me where to begin. A couple of examples? Here you go: Remember the helmet issue in Prometheus? Guess what, in this movie they even don't bother with helmets anymore. Let's go on a foreign planet and breath in parasitic spores - weeeeeeh! Remember the stupid actions of the crew from Prometheus? In this movie a couple of crew members sacrificing a ship full with 2000 people in cryo-sleep, just because they discover a hazy transmission.Of course, the Images of Covenant look astonishing and the creatures move thanks to CGI faster than a jaguar. Oh by the way! Remember the slow and creepy pacing from the first two Alien-Movies? Now the chest from the victims of the infamous Facehuggers burst open within a couple minutes. Instead breeding now included!The list goes on and on, including a incredible cheap, foreseeable pay off at the end. What the first movie made special, was the unknown heritage and background of the xenomorph and the spacejockey. The whole concept was simple and the premise was based simply on a unlucky coincident. A small crew discovers a crashed, mysterious ship with a deadly cargo, stranded on a foreign planet, lost in the depths of space.Now we know - thanks to Prometheus and Alien: CoVenant - that the Spacejockey is in fact just a smarter version of Jason Vorhees and the original Alien Lifeform is the result of a sulky Android and his experiments in the basement.Yes - now, if you watch ALIEN again you witness a bunch of people being butchered by the result of a man-made Android. So in conclusion: the Spacejockeys are now the real 'Aliens' and the Alien from Alien is now a simple weapon, manufactured indirectly by men.Instead of expanding the universe of Alien, Ridley Scott shrunk it.",3,3,5,15 July 2017
