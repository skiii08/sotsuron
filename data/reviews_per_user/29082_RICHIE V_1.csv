Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Time for fun at the movies again! Finally
","This movie was in keeping with the rest of the trilogy as a fun escape experience...but seems hollow compared to the others...it seems so amazed at its own effects, that the story got lost behind them. Still a lot of fun and I could see it many times over.",9,7,9,24 October 1999
