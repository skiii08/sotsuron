Scarface," Greatest Movie Ever
","After seeing this film most others seem dull in comparison.  There haven't been any movies made recently that even come close to the level of entertainment or intensity of Scarface.  If you are looking for a classic see this is a must see, but if you're not go see one of today's fruity films.  Once you see it you will want to watch it again, but it's not for those who like cheesy romances that fruity actors like Tom Hanks always seem to be in.",10,2,4,29 August 2000
