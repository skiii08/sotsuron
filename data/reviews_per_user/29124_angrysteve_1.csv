Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I haven't laughed so much at the cinema in years.
","I got free preview tickets to the showing in Southampton last night. I have to say, it was just hilarious. I saw the trailer ages ago, and had been looking forward to the movie for some time, being a big fan of the Borat short films on the Ali G show. I was worried that perhaps my expectations for this film were too high, having read the many good reviews here on IMDb, but I have to say, they were spot on. There is a general back-story of Borat travelling across America to meet (and marry) Pamela Anderson after seeing her in an episode of Baywatch. Along the way though, he stops off in various places to continue his documentary on America for the people of Kazakhstan, which is where the film really comes into it's own. Each piece is like the short films in the Ali G show, and just as funny, if not even funnier.In true Borat style, it was totally cringe-worthy in places (I'm remembering the national anthem at the rodeo, and the etiquette party), but as usual Sacha Baron Cohen did an excellent job of making the people he 'interviews' along the way show just how stupid/racist/homophobic/bigoted (delete as appropriate) they can be. The chap at the rodeo proved just that. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend anyone see this movie, it was 1h 20mins of laughs. Although there were a couple of scenes that came across as staged (B&B and Pam Anderson scenes), they were still very funny. The hotel wrestling scene was both horrifying and hilarious at the same time :)I have to wonder if anything will be cut, or of the version I saw last night was the final cut. It was only a 15 certificate after all.",9,4,12,11 October 2006
