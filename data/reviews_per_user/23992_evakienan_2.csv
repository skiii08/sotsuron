Hereditary," Drops the mic on the Haunted House genre.
","This film is everything I wanted out of a horror movie. It's dark, it's disturbing, it's human but otherwordly at the same time. It doesn't answer too many questions, while maintaining the true source of fear is not knowing. It made me feel uncomfortable like I was peering into hell itself instead of a film makers tool box. The rest of its brilliance remains unsaid, just watch it for yourself.",10,2,4,18 September 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," An Ordinary Story About an Extraordinary Band
","This film was everything I feared it would be: just like every other rock band biopic out there. Seriously, take any rock band biopic, keep the story but switch out the band for Queen and you have Bohemian Rhapsody. It was rushed, over dramatic, derivative, and never allowed you to have any emotional connection with the characters. It felt more like a dramatized documentary than an interesting story. I have a feeling this film is piggy-backing on the music and legacy of Queen for ticket sales/good reviews more than anything.",4,15,28,7 November 2018
