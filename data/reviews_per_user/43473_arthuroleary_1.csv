The Ring," scary ? are you kidding me?
",This was one of the most boring horror flicks I've ever seen. If you think this was the scariest movie of the last 20 years you are obviously 20 yo or younger. The only thing that even remotley qualified as scary is when you are watching any particularly quiet scene and they go to another with a loud bang of some type. So if you're not in the movie theatre with their sound system that startling part is gone. Psycho and Halloween don't even belong in the same genre of film as they were and are true horror classic. The only thing I think would make this movie scary is if I was forced to watch it again. I'm going to start going to see movies that critics pan because I usually end up seeing a better movie. If you were scared by this movie you must be afraid of your own shadow !!!!!!!!!!!!!,Null,0,0,23 November 2002
