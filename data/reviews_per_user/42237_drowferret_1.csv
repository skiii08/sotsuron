Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A revolting, unintelligent and offensive film
","This film was only funny because of the ridiculous comedic acting of Sacha Cohen. His actions were disgusting and the film itself is incredibly offensive. This man should not still be wandering the streets, he should be in jail. I left the theater 2/3 in because it never got any better, it was all crass and idiotic. It blatantly disparages many cultures and beliefs in a crude and horribly cruel manner. The wild antics and flailings of the actor did not make up for his terrible deeds. Many of these people were only being kind towards him and he took advantage of that. Do not put your money into this sorry excuse for a film.",1,263,528,27 November 2006
