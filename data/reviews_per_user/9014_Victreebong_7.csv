Skyfall," Mild, not bold...
","This is Bond without the full throttle. Quantum of Solace and Casino Royal show us a much fiercer and provocative Bond, even when he's struggling with his own issues in the aforementioned installments. In this film, we hear too much about Bond's back story to make him a man of mystery. So what's bad about that? Well, this franchise doesn't base itself on the ordinary, it prides itself on the extraordinary. Bond without his over-the-top cunning and super human feats isn't Bond. Knowing he's another human being makes him seem dull. The pacing in the movie deliberately slows down the action and intensity way too much to make him the Bond that we've known for years. This is intentional because he's supposed to be an old dog and what not, but why are we watching then? Bond is like a comic book; he's supposed to be 'present tense', not 'has been'.That said, Daniel Graig is his awesome self (even if he's exhausted in every scene), and shoo-in Javier Bardem is as evil as ever, something he seems to excel at. Ralph Fiennes easily fits in as Bond's new overseer, and is delightful in just about everything I've seen him in. His script is a little lacking in the movie, but again that's the movie, not the actor.",8,0,3,14 March 2013
John Wick," WILL own on Blu-ray!
","OK, I'm biased. I'm big on Keanu. No homo. But j/king aside, John Wick is the movie that proves Reeves is still in the game. Ironically, the titular character is doing just what it's titular leading actor is supposedly doing; coming back and staying current. You only have to watch the movie 15 minutes to catch the tongue in cheek remarks thrown out ad nauseam to this.Keanu is all over this movie. I don't know how he manages to stay in-shape after 50; it's clearly himself doing most of the stunt work. He might just have the fountain of youth shoved somewhere in his body. (He is The One after all...) It's still good ol' stone face Keanu. Not as hammy as Keanu from Constantine, or as cold as Keanu from DtESS, but somewhere in between. The guy is all about subtlety and jest. He is forward, without being forward. I like it.Willem *ucking Dafoe!!! Is there any role this cat cannot play?! Seriously, you had me at Dafoe. I think Dafoe is competing with Freeman and Jackson for most utilized supporting actor in Hollywood. He's NEVER a main, always some BAMF supporting cast member. And as always, he's just too good not to love. Even in Fault in Our Stars, he was a lovable crass cynic, but in this movie, he's one of the characters who you just know is a true badass. Keanu ALWAYS picks characters who are loners, yet somehow attracts the guardian angel types, or people who just want him to win. This time around, Dafoe is Wick's guardian angel.Alfie Allen and Michael Nyqvist are the true breakout actors in this film. Allen, as we all know from Game of Thrones, is easy to hate, but hard to love. He plays this role much as he does in GoT by being the prick mob boss's spoiled brat son who has a penchant for not thinking two seconds ahead. And the mob boss, Nyqvist, is probably the best representation of a smarmy yet sophisticated Russian Don since... well he's probably the first really well adapted Russian mob boss we've ever seen! Jack Reacher went up against the Russian's, and I know there's some in Person of Interest, but Nyqvist's Viggo Tarasov has the swagger, brains, and even compassion to stay fresh and noteworthy, well after the film's ended. He's even got this breadth about him, a foreboding barrel chested strength that you don't see a lot of these days, good casting choice! Both actors played their respective wells true to form.I'd like to say more about other actors/characters in the movie, but it would honestly contain spoilers. You don't have to even watch the trailer to find out that this is a straight shoot 'em up, true to the core. The freaking dog dies, how much you wanna bet others will too...Read other reviews if you want to find out about plots, subplots and pacing. John Wick stays fresh and thrilling the entire way through! The stunt work's amazing, the acting is slightly campy yet engaging, the premise is simple, and the movie's a blast!",9,8,22,25 October 2014
Akira," The undisputed definitive title.
","Akira is a film that will live long after it's initial hype and praise. Akira is a shoe-in for the Criterion Collection, if it's not already being considered. Lauded as the anime to start all of the current anime's success, Akira holds firm onto it's iconic violence, cyber punk and dystopian elements to this day. An anime that is as advanced as it was the day it was released, that's something to be heralded.The facets of the film that make it timeless are the same key points that are emulated by other titles. The psionics, kids who are psychic, clairvoyant and not allowed to age into adults, are copy pasted into everything to Pokémon. These entities are not only important in Akira's plot, but are also exemplary exposition units for unraveling the plot behind what's happening in the film. But they're more than just exposition, they are the reason why the protagonist and antagonist are dueling it out to begin with. The psychic archetype owes everything to these guys, and little kid espers as we know them wouldn't exist the way they do now if it weren't for Otomo's vision of how they would act and appear.The protoganist, Kaneda, and his tongue in cheek adopted little brother, Tetsuo represent two sides of the same coin in Akira. The two are compliments to everything a young man has to contend with. Tetsuo's seriousness is mirrored by Kaneda's boyish humor. Where Kaneda has a girl that's crazy about him and he's 'devoted to', Tetsuo acts the fool to impress whatever's in front of him. Where Kaneda can effortlessly impress, Tetsuo struggles to impress with limitless effort, even as the film goes into it's third act. Their relationship is Goku/Vigeta, Asuka/Rei, Cloud/Zack and any other anime dual hero archetype you've ever witnessed.The cyberpunk genre owes its entire earnings to Akira. Where Otomo may have looked at previous futuristic robot mangas like Astroboy for inspiration, Akira sets the stage for cyber meets biological in a whole new fashion. For example, at one point a character must fuse their limb with discarded rubble, creating a synthetic metal arm to use as a prosthetic. Not only does biological meet metal, soul enters the equation at one point. Is Akira a mecha suit anime, no. Does it dabble in futuristic Tokyo cyber principles via vehicle, lasers, big gun and robot appendages, like no other.Where Akira really shines however, is in it's underlying metaphors of control of innocence, totalitarianism, religion and big government. Everybody is under someone else's thumb in this film. Government is facing riots for fascism and corruption, the army is being thrown a coup via political muscle flexing, gangs are being chased and persecuted, the residents of Neo Tokyo 3 can't move without riot police involvement or being sanctioned by barricades, even the Psionics are told they cannot leave quarantine. The entire subplot of Kaneda telling Tetsuo what to do, and Tetsuo's revolt are all key to this same principle that the only one who's truly free in the film Akira is, well, Akira! If you're feeling personally exploited, watch Akira. You'll suddenly feel better about your own 1st world problems.Akira stands the test of time visually, metaphorically, literally, and of course audibly. The film is just as detail driven from every angle as it was when it came out in 1988. If there's ever an anime to connect correlations to every existing anime genre, it's Akira. You'd be plain ignorant to think otherwise.",9,3,6,16 November 2014
Iron Man 2," I don't get the hate.
","I really like the 2nd Iron Man. It doesn't have the captivation of the first entry, or the polarization of the third, or even the camaraderie of The Avengers, but it's easily the funniest of the bunch. It's more lighthearted than any of the other ones. Really, it's just Tony having fun while dealing with some minor personal demons.Robert Downey Jr. is as charismatic as always. We get to see more of the playboy in him and his character this time around. With the fortunate casting of Jon Cheadle (but unfortunate loss of Terrence Howard, thanks a lot Paramount!), Tony's kept in check and assisted by his supporting cast in a perfect choice. Jon Cheadle has come a long way from the accent façade of Ocean's Eleven. His resume just keeps growing and it's no surprise why. Gwenyth Paltrow, Clark Gregg and Jon Favreau are of course the returning cast and nail every line in every scene perfectly, deflecting Tony Stark's tendencies to hedonism in his self-inflicted tumultuous tantrums. Newcomers to the series, Scarlett Johanson and Mickey Rourke, are pure BAMF material; Mickey's character Whiplash (an otherwise little known anomaly in the comic book series) is especially well developed and superbly brought out in yet another shining example of Rourke's acting ability through nuance. I don't know if Rourke actually knows Russian, but you wouldn't be any wiser. But who really stands out in this film is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. Quite possibly the best supporting villain in any Marvel movie yet, Justin Hammer is the Lando Calrissian of Marvel entertainment, attempting to counter Stark Industries' outfitted models with his own inferior 'Hammerroids'. This is through the assistance of Whiplash in a baddie double team, and I'll stop there to avoid spoilers. What really makes Rockwell's character shine is his pompous naïve demeanor and aptitude for superiority by being a total mook! He's hysterical and obnoxious at the same time.---Maybe SPOILERS--- It's true that we see way more of Tony Stark than Iron Man, and some things could have been left out. Some things REALLY should have been left out. We don't need to be dumbed down by believing atoms are created by shiny blue laser beam in a basement man cave through the use of AC ducting. And a stable atom isotope previously undiscovered on a fifties' theme park replica? My IQ isn't in the double digits Marvel. But the interactions between the characters made the movie, so I prefer Tony's personal demons over an extra 15 minutes of Uni-Beams and blurry flight sequences.---End maybe SPOILERS--- Give the movie a rent if you haven't seen it already. If you have seen, maybe a repeat viewing. Remember, this is a COMICBOOK movie. No matter how many times that's said, people still don't understand that sentence.",9,2,3,1 September 2014
Terminator Salvation," Glazed over for some reason.
","Folks, the fan boys were wrong.First, different director. FYI, Cameron was dragged into the second one by Arnie and co, and don't even bring up the third installment. So really, you can only hold James Cameron responsible for the first entry into the series. Don't believe me, read the articles on how many times the rights have changed companies for this series, and what they originally sold for! That being said, if I didn't recognize McG's proficiency as a directer, I do now.The tone and setting of the movie are grainy, beige, post-apocalyptic, dystopian world after Judgement Day. Judgement Day has occurred, but on a different time frame thanks to the previous events of the past movies changing the course of history. This time, we see the world as it would be after those events, including the persecution and enslavement of humanity by the entity known as Skynet. Characters in the film reflect this world, wearing clothes from consignment, military garb, etc. T models, HKs, along with a slew of new robotic baddies, and even the famed T-600s make their way into the film, all thanks to the creative mind and final entry of the historically significant Stan Winston, appearing in probably his last cameo before his passing. And all those robots look as bad-ass as anything else Stan's development team has come up with. While the film may not have the same blue hue that Terminator and T2 had, it definitely has it's own saturation and faded feel to it.Sound is straight Terminator. Danny Elfman is back, including the five notes everybody remembers. This time, terminators make clenching sound when turning and moving, something distinct and unfortunately not reproducible in text for a review. Explosions, lows, and metal clashes sound like they should. Between Bale and Worthington there's plenty of screaming to get your inner aggro on; I think the development team's talent recruitment purposefully selected these two for yelling beyond their recommendations from directors. All in all, it sounds like the franchise should.Talent in this movie is big. Even without Arnold's on-screen presence, there's enough drama and nuance delivered by the main cast to keep people in-thralled. Even Jadagrace grows on you, in-sort of a Newt-esque style, despite delivering no dialog. (If you don't know who the 'Newt' is I'm referring to, go watch some movies.) Sam and Christian keep things very manly and in constant control over their respective situations, even during conflict between each other. The new girls to the series, Moon Bloodgood and Bryce Dallas Howard, are both dramatic and very hot. The chemistry between Sam and Moon is especially hot, and it's a shame they didn't deliver a little more relationship time between the two. Common makes for a solid sidekick, but sadly this installment follows Hollywood's formula for sticking black men in second, or just straight killing them off early, *SPOILER* as is the case for Terry Crews, who we see dead for three seconds in the first eight minutes of the film. *END SPOILER* (If that ruined or spoiled anything for you, your an idiot.) Lastly, Anton Yelchin could be a dead ringer for Micheal Beihn in the near future. Not only did he nail Kyle Reese's mannerisms from the first film, a combination of the make-up department and genetics made him look exactly how a younger Micheal Beihn would have looked. Linda Hamilton returns for an uncredited voice over.The plot is all over the place, and for good reason. We don't know what's going on until towards the middle and end of the movie, even though there's plenty of throwback's, familiar narrative, and plot devices to allude to what's really happening. That's all I can say without ruining things for people who haven't watched yet. Like all installments of the franchise, the characters are either traveling to a destination for an operative, or in hot pursuit by (a) terminator(s). The fundamental why is answered later on. Pacing is solid, we have high and low intensity moments all through out. At no time will you watch the clock, I promise you. I did of course watch the Director's Cut, which does have several more moments of glorious near R-rated cinematography. Live action sequences are fairly long and well spliced together, during a particular sequence, the cameramen had to chase after Moon and Sam for several minutes under stunt fire! Or so it seems from the superb cut job. There is no longer a mother son, nor father son relationship between characters. Instead we get heterosexual lover and bromance dramas popping up.Now, pundits against this movie are idiots. Minor canonical imperfections aside, this entry gave us something old and a lot more new. Throwbacks are all over the place, from lines, to stunts, to events, to returning actors, characters, and even creators. Remember this movie went through over five re-writes before it was shot, and the rights to the series have been sold more times than provinces in South Africa. Even after all that, Sam Worthington was recommended by Cameron when contacted by McG, Stan Winston came back to make more movie magic, Danny Elfman returned for the score, Linda Hamilton for the sheer iconic flair, and even another unmentioned actor found their way into production. The T-600s and 800s look impressive, and despite one intentionally shooting it's foot, they come off menacing. All the other baddies deliver quick dosages of wanton carnage at the blink of an eye, reinforcing the 'kill or be killed' attitude of the series. Even the climaxes of battles, while being very much throwback driven, have awesome and unpredictable outcomes. The angst against this movie is purely nostalgia driven, and nothing more. I also loved the first movie, and had every toy from the line-up when T2 came out back in 1991.Superb flick, and I'd recommend it if you haven't seen or rented it yet.",9,0,1,13 April 2013
Suicide Squad," Short on concept, rife with stereotypes, bad one-liners, re-shoots, we saw this coming.
","If the daily set photos and re-shoots were not red alarms, the first fifteen minutes of Suicide Squad will quickly set them off. Suicide Squad is a mess.The first act is very poorly edited. I chalk this up to lose foreshadowing for later on, and the director getting panned by WB to keep it PG-13. Rough jump shots occur to introduce characters that are somehow NOT introduced well, with the ensemble getting shafted to give Robbie and Smith the most screen time. The the initial premise is totally unbelievable; CIA operative trying to recruit the baddest of the bad to take down... Superman? Batman? JL? I'm not too sure, because Batman is part of the recruiting process in this. Predators has a more convincing plot than Suicide Squad. If the Suicide Squad is the 'contingency plan' then why are they using Bats to get them and nixing their own agents? It's a huge WTF.Second half, the bad guys start bonding, and we get the rebel with a heart of gold syndrome. Problem is not all of them are on-board. Only two of them are remotely likable because the others have been snubbed for screen time, and it's hard to convince us one minute that Harley Quinn gives a sh*t and the next she wants to run off with Mista Jaaay. This goes into the third act as well until the finale.Third act has the least issues and I think this is what Ayer really had in mind; the villains cooperating to take on something bigger. Unfortunately, The Dragon in this movie, sucks. I won't spoil who it is, but come on. Screenwriters have got to start setting up villains properly over the course of multiple movies. One-shot-evil-just-because doesn't work. Not in Marvel, not in DC. If you disliked Whiplash in IM2, you won't be too keen on the real antagonist. (Also, why the weird dancing? If it's too recreate Santanico Pandemonium, try again.) I did kind of like Robbie in this, she's very attractive with her glasses on. But she was overall just annoying. And surprisingly, Hernandez and Jai Courtney for once are the most standout. The other (including Smith and Leto) are just bleh. Smith didn't play Deadshot. Smith played Will Smith. Killer Croc was a huge racial stereotype, Leto growled at people and acted like a weird drug lord (NOT an anarchist), and the other supporting cast were just not quite there. They actually decapitate a Native American guy (who can apparently climb anything) who's part of the Squad without introducing him! Move over NAACP, NCAI would like to talk with Warner.Lastly, the one liners. The effing one-liners! Stahp. My only theory is they were trying to recreate the magic from The Dark Knight trilogy and wound up somewhere around Batman & Robin.So yeah, not my CB movie of the year. Ayer has done better, and I suspect that WB (yet again) tied his hands. He has admitted that the character concept for Joker wasn't right. Hoping, but not holding my breathe for Affleck's Batman movie. But if MoS, BvS, and now SS are any indication, we may not be to far off from another re-re-reboot.",5,1,1,30 January 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," Would happily see this again!
","Average American guy right here, and I dug this flick. I don't care how many 13 year olds were in the theater with me, this movie has emotion. After watching the Descendents, I knew Woodley was going places. She simply delivers in this movie. I'm not going to write a long winded review about the summary, but I will tell you about the acting.Elgort and Woodley truly deliver. You forget they're acting each and every scene. The chemistry between the two is palpable. Laura Dern comes out of nowhere; I think the last time I've seen her face was JP. She puts up a pretty good role as Woodley's torn mother. Defoe is pure love/hate on almost a House level. In fact, he goes beyond House hatred with his apathy in this movie. And the two's sidekick (Wolff) is loads of comic relief, which is surprising considering that he too is in the therapy group. The rest of the cast is just kind of there (sorry Tramell). But that's because the camera is on Woodley and Elgort the entire time. I don't even think there's a scene except for flashbacks where the two are absent.As far as the movie... An emotional roller-coaster. You will get addicted to their relationship. You will cry big man tears internally (and probably externally) after 1.5 hours. You will be emotionally drained.",8,140,184,12 June 2014
