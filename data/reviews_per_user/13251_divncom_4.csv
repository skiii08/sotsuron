Iron Man 3," Brings the action; lacks the depth. Ironman's getting rusty.
","Analysis of the film's pro's and con's.Pro's: 1. The action sequences were beautiful. The final battle on the ship was very nice; the way it ebbed and flowed was very well done. Real suspense was built which shouldn't be taken for granted as that's very difficult to do when you basically KNOW Ironman won't die.The appearance of Ironman's 'back up' was a stroke of genius also. It's too bad we couldn't get more into his ability to control suits remotely. I felt like we had just begun to touch the tip of the iceberg in regard to the vast potential technology. 2. Robert D. J. is always good ... he's authentic. What more can I say about him; he loves the character he's playing and there's never a moment you see him phoning his performance in. I get the feeling he reads the books, knows the source material, etc. Genuinely loves the character. 3. Ben Kingsley was wonderful - absolutely taken by surprise by him in this film and he's hilarious. I really felt like he stole every scene he was in. Original, creative - that entire angle was innovative. 4. We may be seeing the groundwork for the future of Ironman - he ends the film with an interesting dialogue which can be construed in a number of ways. I was hoping it indicated it was going to continue following the story arc of the comic book (he and the AI merging). 5. Don Cheadle is a gifted actor and he actually DOES have chemistry with RDJ (you could envision them being good friends). This entire angle was poorly explored in favor of more and more of Pepper. Ugh6. Innovative use of the technology behind the suits - we're really beginning to see the fuller Ironman technology/potential take some shape. The way the suits merged, reconfigured, had an almost independent intelligence was impressive and creative. We all go to the movie to see the suit and it doesn't disappoint. Tony is all about technology and they made sure to drive it home. Con's: 1. Weak villain. The most important villain in the Ironman world was presented in a very poor way. Some effort was done to provide background and motivation at the beginning of the film but it was fleeting and superficial (he got embarrassed). This doesn't explain his desire for unfettered violence and vengeance. It's a weak presentation, derivative and boring. I'm saying this in spite of being a huge Guy Pearce fan. He's a tremendous actor. Villains are more interesting when they have a complex personality and REAL motivation (grey area). One good example of this is the Joker in TDK - his philosophy was palpable and believable; you could BELIEVE someone might live this way. 2. Lack of explanation of the source of the villains power/technology. We're introduced to him as he demonstrates some technology for pepper. It's extremely vague, though, and the notion of controlling the brain didn't exactly explain people regenerating body parts, breathing fire and tearing iron man's suits apart like paper. 3. G. Paltrow/Pepper Potts. It's difficult to believe Paltrow reads or is even vaguely familiar with Ironman. Never get the feeling she enjoys the role or even knows anything about her character. She's meant to be spritely, ingenious in her own way, etc. She doesn't convey it. It goes so far sometimes that you seriously can NOT take their relationship seriously; total lack of chemistry. This is sad because a massive amount of the film relies on their relationship. I can't convey it thoroughly enough the extent to which I think she drove this movie into the ground. 4. The PTSD angle. The root of this film was meant to be RDJ fighting his 'demons'. Alright - so he has PTSD from flying a NUKE INTO A WORMHOLE. The director did not sufficiently justify this angle with an appropriate amount of attention â€“ comes off as bizarre. 5. Ironman's suits being tore apart like paper by fire breathing dragon people. 6. Warmachine/Iron Patriot may have well have not even been in the film. Was waiting to see him kick some butt in his suit. Disappointing. 7. A lack of the presence of the other Avengers in any regard. Yes yes I know the explanation is they're off doing other things ... still. A brief appearance, a shot of them doing whatever it is they're doing would really help to weave this universe together. This film was much more engaging than Ironman 2 but was not as good as the first film. There are definite signs of wear and tear on many of the films more 'relied upon' imagery and themes. Paltrow's character was relied upon HEAVILY in this film and I discovered it was an extreme turn off. I found her repulsive and thus I could not empathize with Tony's excessive motivation to go to any length to protect her (which was the basic premise of the film). The other important aspect of any comic book film is the villain. Believe it or not I found Loki to be the more compelling villain than this version of the Mandarin. He has no real motivation or philosophy; he's just 'getting' people back. The third leg then is RDJ himself. He succeeded mostly - unfortunately the fact that he constantly relies on Pepper as his supposed source of emotional stability and motivation is not believable. The action sequences were superior to the previous two films so if you're going to the movie for that you'll be rewarded. I recommend the film but I can't talk about it in as effusive a manner as some others have.",7,4,11,25 April 2013
Oldboy," Greek Tragedy meets Saw via Kill Bill and Lucky Number Slevin.
","I just finished watching Oldboy, the original language version. First off, the very core of the film; the aspect of this film that most of its most ardent defenders point to as being so substantially original and wholeheartedly moving is the notion of incest and the complications arising from having inadvertently become entangled in such a dilemma.Unfortunately for most people who worship this film, this idea has been worked before. It's been worked so thoroughly, in fact, that it's thousands of years old. That's right - it's not original. Sigmund Freud (do you know who he is?) based a huge chunk of his theory of psychodynamic psychotherapy on the source material: Oedipus the King. Short history lesson: If you didn't learn this at University or didn't go to University or pay attention in high school, you might have missed the portion where you learned about 'Greek Tragedy'. That's what Oedipus the King is. Oedipus the King was written in the year 429 BCE by Sophocles.I will not digress into the intricacies of Greek Tragedy here; the fact that people in this day and age find inferior derivative products to be works of sheer masterpiece speaks volumes on its own. If a cheap 2500 year old rip-off pop culture gore-fest like Oldboy is a masterpiece, what is Sophocles tragedy?I implore those of you who are younger or uneducated on the topic to delve more into the area of the classics ... read works like Antigone, The Iliad ... etc. If this film kindled a fire for this sort of moral conundrum/tale of horrible destiny in you, then please go study the classics more (by classics I don't mean The Godfather; I mean the Classics with a capital C - Greek, Roman, Dante, etc.) If all it takes to produce a masterpiece is to take the core of somebody else's 2500 year old Greek tragedy (which in themselves became morose in their commonality during their time), add slick production value, violence and extreme gore to make a masterpiece - then I'm done with the notion of evaluating or participating in the debate over film.Make sure to take a very long look at a film before you're swept away with its material. Make sure it's not stolen; make sure you're educated before you go to the movie theater. It's a damn shame if you have seen 'Oldboy' before you've read Romeo and Juliet, your basic canon of Greek tragedy, etc. So, what qualifies as original? That's up to you as a viewer. Find something that is more modern in its philosophy. Just hypothetically - existentialism is much newer (relatively) than Greek Tragedy. If a film bases the core of its ideas and plot on something much more dynamic and current such as this, they're actually contributing to OUR era. CREATING something.Oldboy has created nothing; it is less than the sum of its parts: A derived Greek Tragedy combined with excessive gore, excessive stylization and excessive reliance on modern scenery to shroud an eternal theme. Take these elements and you have, at best, a Saw level film with twists and turns ... throw in a bit of The Crying Game and Kill Bill and viola.I prize originality above all else. I found none here; overrating a film based on the misconception of originality is a big pet peeve of this critic. 6/10 for good cinematography, acting and adaptation of a very old idea.",6,2,7,10 May 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Workman like, mild thrills - uneven direction; overall lacking in purpose.
","Why did we need a Spiderman reboot when there are so many other ideas that could have been brought to life with the same budget, cast and direction?The singular answer is that the studio sees this and every other huge budget comic book extravaganza as an investment. A huge one. When you're monkeying around with an investment on this scale, you're conservative: You make just enough semi-relevant changes to justify the films existence. That just doesn't cut it though for such an iconic character. You must either accept or reject the notion that, in the end, all you will be receiving with this title is a slightly different take on the same old story. Don't walk into the theater expecting reinvention of the wheel.If you can completely embrace the notion that you will be force fed the same formulaic origins story from start to finish with pin point precision in playing identical emotional notes to its forbearer - you won't be severely disappointed. There just isn't a rational reason to have to lower your expectation, though. The primary reason I find this Spiderman unacceptable isn't that the character is boring. It isn't that the actors are bad - they aren't. Garfield is a particularly good Spiderman; better than Maguire. The main reason this film is unacceptable is that the bar has moved drastically. Hardcore comic book fans are packing the theaters with higher expectations than ever; the genre has evolved so to speak. With titles like X-Men first Class, The Avengers and The Dark Knight films in the same universe - this Spidey simply doesn't have the same impact as the ten years old predecessor. In this new, evolved universe fans are more savvy. We now expect the thrill rating to ratchet up higher; the contours to be more dynamic. We expect to see ensembles; teams and entire casts of superhero's working together in the same universe ... the Marvel movie universe. We expect a degree of suspense. This film has no suspense- of course not; not when we've seen it already before it begins. What we have here is something that might have been great 10 years ago. It's not great now; it's profoundly average in the context of the other comic book films surrounding it. If it's at all legally possible, I would sincerely hope that Spiderman exist (in a clearly defined and visible way) within the Marvel Universe that has so rapidly expanded ... leaving the web slinger in his own niche only makes him that much more insignificant. My hope is that somehow Spidey can be incorporated into the Marvel Universe in much the same way the Avengers worked; or in much the same way X-Men first class worked. Adding some comic book buddies will take some of the weight off of Garfield's shoulders ... he's a good Spiderman but I don't feel he can carry the load alone. Until then, it's the same old story - and your friendly neighborhood Spiderman is awfully lonely relying on the same old schtick.",5,38,79,4 July 2012
Prometheus," A sci-fi fan's science fiction movie.
","I'm stingy with my ratings. I seldom give out anything above an 8, even to the most impressive films.I'm giving Prometheus a 9.There is no weak link in this movie; there is nothing to point at as useless filler. Every inch of it is filled with meaningful things: Things which have a purpose to exist.In offering these things, we're treated to a master-work in the art of creating atmosphere on the big screen. The most apathetic and stoic of us will find it difficult to remain completely unaffected by the intensity of suspense encountered here. It moves in grand strides: The serene, human dominated world - one of technological sterility and human born power is created. The narrative introduces a twist ... nature. Nature reduces mans illusions to tatters. It's a powerful arc when done properly. To truly enjoy Prometheus (a film which I would most aptly describe as a mixture between Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey) you must have gone further: You must have totally absorbed the environment, characters,realities, weaknesses, the entire essence of this world - its archetypes, and their predecessors.And make no mistake, this is a profoundly symbolic film. On watching the movie once as of writing this, I clearly appreciated the fluidity and genuineness with which the director was able to summon the archetypes, plots, dynamics and human drama of cinematic past (or future, in the films case). I would imagine I could only appreciate the vast landscape of symbolism even more on repeated viewing.There are a plethora of lyrical, visual and sensual payoffs to keen observers. This is a movie which demands and rewards attention.Ridley Scott has crafted something difficult and done it with a perceived ability of ease and flawlessness which is inspiring. Various sci-fi masterpieces meld together in this epic; the genre being represented in almost every way shape and form. In the end, though, what we have is a philosophical film. It's up to every individual to take what they can/want/will from the symbolism and drama portrayed here: And there is a great deal of it. Death, life, mortality, the contrast between the sterility of technology and the vividness of organic life ... Herman Melville wrote about man's epic duel with nature ... one he is destined to lose. Prometheus continues this great philosophical legend with masterful visual effects, effective and unwasted dialogue, and an unwavering focus by the director on the core of its message. And as if this all wasn't enough, as an afterthought we're presented with the most convincing female lead since - well ... Alien. Man ... Materialism ... Vanity ... Nature ... Destruction ... it's all in this one.",9,6,14,11 June 2012
