Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Brilliant horror
","The eighties' classic and technical marvel Who Framed Roger Rabbit, for all its singing, dancing animals and deliberately toonish direction, is above all a horror movie. A chilling, twisted, bizarre and surreal experience which is unlike anything released before or after it (that I've laid my eyes on, anyway). The interaction between man and toon is enough to make you uneasy, as it in my opinion just looks plain wrong. Animated characters should stay within their animated environments; in the real world, their slightly unreal presence is like something out of a bad dream or hallucination. But it is in the film's final scenes, in a genuinely shocking twist, that the true nature of Roger becomes clear. Take my word for it, this is in no way a film for children. (On a completely different note, Betty Boop definitely should've had more screen time.) Acting and voice acting is solid. Christopher Lloyd is superb as always, an underrated actor, seemingly born for this type of role. I don't think it would be hyperbole to call Lloyd's Doom one of the best on-screen villains. The Doom character is one of absolute inspiration and originality, and a part that could only have been done justice by someone with Lloyd's understanding of the material. With only a handful of scenes, he leaves the strongest impact on the viewer. Especially his final scenes are nothing short of unforgettable. If you haven't seen the film yet, you're probably skeptic. I know I'd find it hard to believe that a film about a goofy rabbit with a speech impediment could be unsettling. But it is, and if you watch with an open mind, I guarantee that you will be as weirded out as I was. Now please, don't get me wrong; Roger Rabbit is both a functional murder-mystery and a chuckle-worthy comedy, and both elements are competently handled by Zemeckis (at the peak of his creativity here). But to me, who was in the presumed target audience by the time I first laid eyes on the film, Roger Rabbit will always be a spine-chilling creation. It is horrifying, and it is a must-see, for those who are ready to tumble down Zemeckis' warped rabbit's hole.",9,0,0,18 July 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," 'I love... carpet. I love... desk. I love... lamp.'
","A consistently funny movie whose humour is very similar to that of Seth McFarlane's 'Family Guy', minus the flashbacks and never-ending chicken fights. The basics are still more or less the same: thin, largely inconsequential plot line, one-dimensional characters, non-sequiturs, gay jokes, and half-baked social satire. Steve Carell dominates every scene he's in as the slightly challenged reporter Brick. Though the plot, as I said, is impossible to care very much about, the film never bores thanks to an endless onslaught of dumb jokes and a great cast. Ferrell, Koechner, Carell and the incomparable Paul Rudd are perfect as a quartet of misogynist, homophobic news reporters whose lives are turned up-side-down when an ambitious woman (gasp!), played by Christina Applegate, starts working at their office.Some might say that the social satire doesn't work, but I think that in a time when page after page in newspapers are devoted to the likes of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, the notion that a pregnant panda becomes a huge national event doesn't seem so absurd. Overall very entertaining in a 'I think I just got substantially dumber' kind of way. If the steady stream of gags don't do it for you, there's always the virtual marathon of cameos to enjoy: Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo, Vince Vaughn, Fred Willard, Missi Pyle, Seth Rogen, the list goes on. 60% of the time, you'll like this movie 100% of the time.",7,1,2,21 October 2007
