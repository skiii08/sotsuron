Scarface," Over-rated gangster movie.
","Generally over-rated from my perspective. There is much gratuitous violence that does little to propel the story. The story itself leaves me wondering why I should care about these people. After such a dramatic ending, I would like to feel something about what happens to these characters. I didn't see many dimensions to the main characters. They were tough, they were bad, they were amoral, but there was little understanding of why they got that way, or what might have made a difference in their characters. What was the point of the film? 'Crime doesn't pay'? There are some good performances, but the movie seems longer than necessary than it needs to be considering there is no point to take away from it.",5,4,7,12 February 2001
Romeo + Juliet," Good concept in part, bad execution
","I love Shakespeare made relevant through modern dress, etc., but the attempt to make Shakespeare's poetry sound 'conversational' just didn't work for me. Nobody I know speaks conversationally in iambic pentameter. The language begs for a more stylized delivery. I did like many of the sets and the 'rival gang' flavor however. The helicoptors and car chases were dramatic and something that I could easily accept as something Shakespeare might have included if he had written the play in the current era. I can see why many people enjoyed this film. I just couldn't accept Shakespeare's language in modern conversational tones. It made the acting seem abysmal in places and totally unbelievable throughtout. It often seemed as if the actors had no idea of the meaning of the words they spoke. I'm sure this was not true, but the delivery made it seem so.",3,2,4,1 March 2004
