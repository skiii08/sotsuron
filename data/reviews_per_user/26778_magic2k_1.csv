Catch Me If You Can," double whammy
",this movie is a big winner on two fronts: first it made me forget i was watching leonardo di caprio. second the re-creation of that era in new york city is so painstaking in even the smallest detail that it has me watching the movie over and over. it is a very warm nostalgic trip to the time and place i grew up in. i will be forever grateful and recommend this movie very highly.,10,1,2,17 January 2004
