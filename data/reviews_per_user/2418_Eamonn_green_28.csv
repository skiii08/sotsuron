The Blair Witch Project," Terrible
","CONTAINS SPOILERS Why are people saying this is scary? The characters, you didn't care about and were glad to see their death! They deserved it! They shouldn't have kicked their map into the river! I was glad to see them die! The end was crap! They could have showed someone finding the footage! Did I see a different film from other people? Blair Witch 2 is actually worse than this! Not Scary. 5 out of 10",Null,0,1,5 February 2002
The Ring," This was meant to be scary?
","This is a US remake of a Japanese remake of a Korean remake of a Korean TV movie based on a novel called Ringu.Right 4 perfectly healthy teenagers die on the same night after watching a weird videotape with a ring on it. A journalist who is an aunt of one of the teenagers who died investigates it, finds the videotape and watches it. Then she receives a weird phone call.This wasn't as scary as people made it out to be. Seriously there were a few jump scenes but nothing that would keep you from sleeping.The best performance is from the sexy Naomi Watts (Children of the Corn 4) who plays Rachel Keller the journalist. Her acting was outstanding though Martin Henderson's (that dumb aussie soap Home and Away) and Brian Cox's (Manhunter: Red Dragon) performances were also notable.If this film wasn't cleverly made I would have crucified it and made it out to be terrible. It has a good plot twist but that doesn't make great horror. 6 out of 10.",Null,0,1,1 March 2003
The Mummy," Great film!
","How could anyone not like this film? What were people expecting? A classic horror film?Well I wasn't and I wasn't disappointed. I wanted an exciting action adventure with a bit of horror elements and that is what I got.Rick O'Connell is saved from getting hanged when Evelyn Carnahan wants him to show were an ancient city called Hamunaptra were they find a book. Evelyn unwisely reads the book and wakes a mummy Imhotep who when he was alive had an affair with the Pharaoh's wife. After being caught they kill the Pharaoh, try to escape but Imhotep is caught and mummified in Hamunaptra. After being woken Imhotep is helped by one man to regain his life and then there is chaos.This was a fun exciting film with lots of great action. So if you wanted something else or more of something you expected too much. 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,27 August 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Brilliant use of suspense
","This was a great horror/comedy film but then what else are you to expect from Tim Burton?This had great use of suspense and had no plot holes unlike the Blair Witch Project. The horseman is brilliantly played by Christopher Walken and when he had his head he looked psychotic!The story is based on a legend as many people know, a man from New York called Icabod Crane goes to investigate murders in a rural town. Each person dead being found decapitated. A young man called Masbath who's father has been murdered helps Crane find the murderer and goes into the western woods with him.There is a twist to this story but unlike The Sixth Sense, you won't work it out.This isn't the best horror of the decade(that title goes to Children of the Corn 3) its not the best horror from 1999(Deep Blue Sea, Stir of Echoes) but is a must see for all horror/suspense fans!I give this an 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,13 August 2002
Alien," Disturbing (may contain spoilers)
",Jesus this was scary. Scarier than any other horror films about aliens. This was really disturbing. I tried not to think of it after I saw it but I lost sleep over this. This team find alien eggs. Then an egg is disturbed and the aliens start killing everybody. The aliens are really scary and real looking. Jesus there is a really scary scene where an alien pops out of a mans stomach. If you think The Thing (1982) or Signs (2002) is scary then watch this. No don't it might scare you to death! 8 out of 10.,Null,0,1,15 February 2003
Romeo + Juliet," Not my kind of film
",Ok I have to admit that it's not my kind of film but it's better than the play. Tybalt is menacing as you would expect him to be. Mercucio's(I'm not sure that's how you spell his name) death speech is dramatic as you would expect. Romeo is like he is in the play but Juliet isn't pretty as you would expect. Though the end is more unimaginative than the play! What that is possible? If you hate love stories avoid like the plague if you like love stories it's a must see.,Null,0,0,13 August 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Had its moments
","It was funny but it made all male people look like a bunch of w'nkers which I say being male is definitely not true.Its a storyline which is not great. British woman keeps diary and tries not to stay single. Ok it could have worked had it not been directed by a stereotypcial director.The stars? Lets see Renee Zelwegger(who?), Hugh Grant(crap actor) and Colin Firth(who?). Not great casting.Chick fliks can be enjoyable(I'm not saying this film wasn't) but this doesn't deserve the credit it gets.This was funny but it was to stereotypical for my liking. 5.5 outta 10.",Null,0,0,4 August 2002
American Pie," Great comedy
","This is the best comedy ever! Kevin, Ostreicher, Finch and Jim make a pact to lose their virginity on prom night. All does not go to plan at the start and their obnoxious but laugh out loud hilarious friend Stifler keeps making fun of and maybe hampering them. Jim is more intelligent than he is given credit for and he gets less luck than most fans would think he deserves, Finch is the eccentric one who thinks he is the most intelligent, Ostreicher is a jock but feminine and Kevin is the deadly serious friend of the group. There are so many funny parts in this film you have to go and see it. Great combination of sex and comedy. What sets this apart that it is a 'nicer' comedy and if you see the film you will know what I mean. 9 out of 10. I would have give it a 10 only they deleted the best scene of the film with Stifler's wee brother coming out of the closet and Jim and Michelle are lying on the bed.",9,0,1,7 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Disappointing (contains spoilers)
","Its not a rule to make a film too long because at 3 hours long Lord of the rings should have been made longer. I just went to see how they destroyed the ring, but they didn't! Was that not the whole point of Frodo having the ring? It is one of them films I say don't have a ending e.g. Italian job. That drives me crazy you wait till the end of the film to see the ending and then theres no ending! Still its a film worth watching.",1,1,5,13 January 2002
Armageddon," Better than Deep Impact
","This is the better of 'the end of the world' films that came out in 1998. In Armageddon there was no annoying dumb teenager like Elijah Wood's character in Deep Impact.This is a love story and an entertaining action sci-fi. Harry Stamper is a man who's to train astronauts to save the world but he gets his oil drillers to save instead. One of his oil drillers in love with his daughter but then things go wrong and one of the two closest men to her has to die or earth is destroyed!Obviously one character that you don't want to die does die. At the end of the film I was left with a tear in my eye but at the end of Deep Impact I was left with a bad mood.If you're thinking of seeing Deep Impact dont, see this instead. 7 outta 10.",Null,1,2,16 August 2002
The Shining," It's bad and it's not scary
","The film had a good premise- a good caring father turns into a homicidal maniac once he gets snowed into a hotel. How could you go wrong? Well the fact that a horror film should be scary and this wasn't. No good suspense created. No well timed startle shocks and no freaky things. Kubrick's direction was bad. Nicholson, Duvall and Lloyd's performances are all terrible. Well Lloyd has an excuse- Kubrick didn't let him know that he was acting in a horror film! The Red Rum scene could have worked well if Kubrick had told Lloyd he was in a horror and if the letters weren't messed up. And how come 'The Shining' was only touched upon? Anyway read the book skip the film.",Null,1,2,1 November 2003
Face_Off," Great action film
",The action is great in this film. The acting is also at a high standard. The plot is a cop called Sean Archer(John Travolta then Nicolas Cage) swaps faces with a criminal called Castor Troy(Nicolas Cage then John Travolta). After Castor Troy kills Sean Archer's son Archer sets out to kill Castor Troy and get his face back. The action is great but this isn't likely to happen in real life but a great film. One of the only things I don't like is the wee kid being left with no parents at the end.,Null,1,3,17 August 2002
Spider-Man," Great action film
","I didn't walk into the cinema with high hopes as it was directed by Sam Raimi but this film was great.Peter Parker narrates a story about how he was bitten by a genetically modified spider and then turned into Spiderman. His sweetheart Mary Jane Watson is going out with a boy who hates Peter and he is hated just as much by Peter. Then she dumps him for Peters best friend Harry. Spiderman's adversary is Harry's dad who accidently turned into the green goblin.The special effects are great, whoever said the special effects didn't go well with the background is a liar. It went brilliantly with the background.Tobey Maguire's and Kirsten Dunst's performances were brilliant.The only bad thing was the editing. Why don't film makers look for the goofs then edit them out? Any way don't try to notice them and you won't.I would give this an 8 or 9 out of 10. I can't wait for Spider-Man 2.",Null,0,0,10 August 2002
The Exorcist," I hate the Exorcist
","Crap plot. A girl is possessed by a demon and needs an exorcism. Oh no! I'm too scared! It starts off in some country in the middle east, what relevance is this too the rest of the movie? What was the point of that scene? This film is vile, disgusting, anti catholic filth. I don't know how anyone can watch this! It's not scary in fact it's terribly boring. I couldn't wait for the end of the film so I turned it off. Nothing could have saved this terrible film. 0 out of 10.",Null,4,8,7 December 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Best film ever!
","Right this is the best of the Jurassic Park films. The special effects for this film were class. The acting by Pete Postlethwaite(In the name of the father), Jeff Goldblum(Jurassic Park), Julianne Moore(Hannibal) and Vince Vaughn(Psycho) is very good. It is loosely based on the book and did not have some of the main characters from the book but that didn't make the film any worse! It had the best and most tense parts from the book. The trailer hanging over the edge of the cliff? Why didn't people like the San Diego part? It was entertaining and had action. Or did you want something different from this film?
A reviewer complained that it didn't have enough gore. Ok take the gory parts from the book and remember that this film wasn't just for an older audience. Oh how would a child react to a man getting his intestine ripped out by a dinosaur or a man's crotch being bit off by a dinosaur? Or would that not be gory enough? Gore is only essential for horror movies and The Lost World or any of the Jurassic Park movies are anything but horror films. They are Sci-fi adventure films.So why do people not like this film? It had more action than the other 2 in the series. The special effects were better. It was more entertaining.What did people expect? A horror film? Then they were expecting too much and were disappointed.A great film if you want to be entertained for 2 hours watch this. 10 out of 10.",10,8,15,17 August 2002
Moulin Rouge!," This gave me a headache
","This was boring and just thinking about the flashing lights and fast action gives me a headache. Its about a man falling in love with a girl at a night club called Moulin Rouge. Not a great storyline, bad acting, bad script, bad idea and you expect another Romeo and Juliet here? Well you're wrong if you haven't seen this and that's what you're expecting. Its crap.",Null,2,4,13 August 2002
Paranormal Activity," A great psychological horror
",This is a great film. The techniques used by the director and camera people have the desired effect. This is the quality of filming that the makers of The Blair Witch Project should have been aiming for.What makes this film a masterpiece is the balance of techniques used. Suspense is used at the correct times and the timing of the stingers in this film is immense. Also the sounds used in the film sends one's imagination wild. When a film can get inside your imagination there are no limits or boundaries to how much that film can terrify you.The cinematographer deserves applause also as the lighting in this film creates a lot of suspense and sets the audience up for many frightening stingers.This is what Drag Me To Hell could have been and what Blair Witch should have been. To summarise this is a must see for horror fans especially fans of the Fourth Kind which is similar in quality and similar filming techniques are used. This hellish psychological horror shows The Exorcist and films like it for the mediocre drivel that they are.,10,2,6,18 October 2010
Scream 2," As good as the first if not better
",This was good. Though the killer(s) in this one isn't/aren't as good as the killers in the first. It was scarier than the first.The plot is two years after the first Scream they make a movie based on the events of Scream called Stab. At the first viewing of Stab 2 people are killed. The story also follows the life of Sidney Prescott and Randy Meeks. Then Gale works out as more people are killed someone's choosing their victims to copy Woodsboro!One thing that I don't like about this film is that characters I want to live die.But still it's worth watching.I've you liked the first you'll like this. 7.5 out of 10.,Null,0,0,26 August 2002
Jaws," Brilliant
","This is a classic film that shouldn't be missed.A shark terrorizes a small island and starts eating lots of people. Three men set out to kill it.This a great film that is really scary the first time you see it and has some really bloody deaths. If you like this film you should see Peter Benchley's The Creature (1998). The theme music in this film is one of the best things in this film, it makes Jaws scarier than it is. 8 out of 10",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Underrated
","No you're not hallucinating, this film is underrated! How is it underrated? According to dumb users on IMDB 'Lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring' is better! It starts off with Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) a banker in his car with a gun. His wife is sleeping with another man. Next scene is Andy defending himself but he gets life in jail at the end of the scene. Andy makes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman, also narrator). Andy is someone who really hopes to get out but Red is afraid of getting to used to living behind bars.It turns out to be one of the best films ever. People who haven't seen it say 'Its just a jail film' Its not! When they end up watching it they find out its not just a jail film. Another thing its unpredictable which is what you expect when you see a film.Nobody cannot like this film! I could go on forever about the reasons why this film is so good, just watch it. 10 out of 10",10,0,0,8 March 2002
Scream," Entertaining but there is something everyone hates about this film
",I hate it being considered being a great horror film when it isn't even scary. It's not even as good as Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer. It overshadowed better films than it. If this hadn't had been made neither would have Witchouse (1999)(V). It has a brilliant twist but you'll work it out but not as quick as you worked out The Sixth Sense's twist.The plot is a killer goes around killing teenager[Oh my god! That's even more original than the plot of Lost Souls (2000))]. He has a reason to though and he is obsessed with this one girl called Sidney. Sidney's mother died a year before the killer started killing the teenagers.The performances are good but the outstanding performance is by Neve Campbell.The film is well worth seeing but is well overrated. 7.5 out of 10.,Null,0,0,24 August 2002
Halloween," The one, The only, The classic Halloween(May contain spoilers)
","This is good for the low budget it had but everyone says this is really scary. It's not. It does startle, send chills down your spine and make you jump but you shouldn't have any trouble. Parts of the film will scare you like when Bob goes to get a beer or when the seemingly dead Michael Myers is getting up behind Laurie.The score is one of the best in any horror films. It was very basic but very scary. Michael Myers was a very scary character. He killed his sister in 1963 and spent 15 in a mental institute. He steals a car and goes to Haddonfield. In Haddonfield Laurie Strode and Annie Brackett are babysitting across the street from each other. Meanwhile Michael's doctor Sam Loomis is trying to stop what he knows is going to happen. He says to the Sheriff 'I spent 8 years trying to reach that boy 7 trying to keep him locked up because what was behind that boys eyes was simply pure evil' What made Michael scarier in this film is that he didn't mess about. He killed them and pursued his next victim. In sequels he messed about.Make no mistake this should not be the best horror you've seen. Dan Grant asked in his review 'what horror film would you rather watch?' I would rather watch films from the Children of the Corn series which mostly are from the 90's which he keeps mouthing off about for bad horror. Yes the best Children of the Corn film was in the 80's but the 90's wasn't bad. He has a point though, modern horror should be like Halloween. Using the same technique and suspense.I Know What You Did Last Summer is the only modern teen killer movie that can compare with Halloween. Halloween shaped horror. Every horror fan should know that.Halloween is unpredictable but the predictable parts are scary when they eventually happen (good use of suspense) for example when Annie Brackett is getting into the car. This isn't very gory so you shouldn't be put off and every horror fan should watch this! Enjoy. 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,30 October 2002
The Sixth Sense," Terrible
","This is so predictable and crap. You know what happens for the rest of the film in 5 minutes, whats the fun in that?A lonely child can see ghosts and seeks help from a psychologist. The psychologist wonders why nobody is talking to him but the lonely child knows.Please don't watch this, this is similar to Stir of echoes which is a far better film. Stir of echoes is less predictable and scarier. The sixth sense could have been a better film but it wasn't, 5 out of 10.",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
Final Destination," Great teen horror
",Ok the reasons I rented out this film was because I heard it was a good horror film and it had Seann William Scott who is one of my favourite actors.Alex falls asleep before a flight takes off to go to Paris. He has a nightmare about the plane exploding and when things happen when he wakes up that happened in the nightmare he wants to get off the plane but he starts a fight with Carter who thinks Alex is lying. Anyway when the fight happens 5 people are thrown off the plane. Alex's friend goes off to help Alex and a girl called Clear who also knows what's gonna happen goes off on her own free will. The plane crashes. Then Death keeps killing the survivors in order they would have died in the explosion.This could have been a comedy horror because it had comedy elements for example someone says 'You may as well drop dead!' but they drop dead suddenly after.It has some of the best jump scares ever but I was hoping the Grim Reaper would take out a scythe to kill one of the survivors. He is death after all and the mortician mentioned him.Another thing though is that there isn't enough gore in this film. There is one gory(if even) death scene. Note down for sequel there must be more gore.There are characters you want to die that don't and people you want to survive that died in this film. Note again for sequel let likeable people survive and unlikeable people to be slaughtered.It had a great ending. The inevitable sequel comes out it should start the second the first one ended.A good teen horror. 9 outta 10.,Null,0,2,3 September 2002
The Birds," Don't watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",This a not very scary film. For a start birds would not be so aggressive if unprovocked and it did not explain why the birds were so aggressive! I waited until the end to see what the ending was like. What ending? This is a film with no ending and if you have seen the Italian job you know what I'm talking about. If you want to see a good thriller/ horror see Children of the corn (1984) or one like this only better see Arachnophobia (1990). I'll be kind with marking 3 out of 10.,Null,2,4,23 December 2001
Jurassic Park," One of the best films ever!
","This is one of the best films ever! There are few films better than this, The Lost World: Jurassic Park being one of them.This film is about a rich person called John Hammond builds a zoo with dinosaurs in it but one of the workers died while the zoo was being developed. A lawyer goes down to island to see if the zoo is safe but on his visit everything goes wrong.This is a brilliant film, if you don't like it you're very sad. It has brilliant special effects, a brilliant story line and its a film that nobody should miss.",10,3,5,19 January 2002
Evil Dead II," I cannot believe this!
","This film is terrible. It breaks the rules of zombie movies. For a start, zombie bites person, person turns into zombie. Its the whole body that turns into a zombie not just a tiny body part! Another rule that is broken once a man is a zombie he can't turn back into a human. But in Evil Dead 2 he can! Its unlikely you would go back into the same house were you're friends and girlfriend died. Would anyone be that stupid? No. Was there anything as fake as possessed Henrietta's monster in the basement? No and the only thing thats close to being that fake is the monster at the end of Children of the Corn III. Did Evil Dead really need a sequel? If it did it needed one better than this. 0 outta 10.",1,3,17,21 July 2002
The Godfather," Dull and boring
",What? How did a film like this get a rating of 9? This bored the life out of me! For a start nothing happens in the first hour except a wedding! Once things do start happening the story is misleading and the plot is hard to follow. By the end of the film I was completely lost. Al Pachino has acted in better films(Donnie Brasco). Francis Ford Coppola has directed(The Outsiders) and produced(Jeepers Creepers) better films. 0 outta 10.,Null,6,15,23 July 2002
