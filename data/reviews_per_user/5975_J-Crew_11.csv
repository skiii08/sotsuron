Ghost," ***1/2 out of ****; Grade: B+
","Wonderfully affecting comedic/romantic thriller about a man killed who remains on this planet, trying to warn his living fiance about danger with the help of a con-artist who happens to hear the dead.  Gauzy romance, huggable humor (complements of Goldberg, who won a deserved Oscar for this role), and moments of tension and wonder blend surprisingly well, and create a satisfyingly varied experience.  Swayze and Moore are charming together.",Null,1,2,7 July 2000
As Good as It Gets," *** out of ****; Grade: B
","Good-hearted but meandering film about three people - a caustic author, a lonely waitress, and a gay artist - learning to like and even love each other. Nicholson is divine, and Hunt and Kinnear can almost match him. However, Brooks' Oscar-winning film offers one completely unconvincing romance, and therefore a lame ending. The first hour or so, however, is a joy.",Null,0,0,13 January 2000
American Pie," ***1/2 out of ****; Grade: B+
","For a comedy to work, the characters in it must either be very sympathetic or very unsympathetic, with little space between.  This film chronicles a couple months in the lives of four likable high school seniors, desperate to experience sex before finishing high school.  The lack of originality in the idea is more than compensated for with loads of humor, a truly appealing cast, and an unexpected sweetness amid all the vulgarity.  Funny, witty, and certain to contain many future stars.",Null,0,0,6 July 2000
American Beauty," **** out of ****; Grade: A
","A transcendant, beautiful film about suburban decay circa late 1990s. Dark comedy mixes wonderfully well with serious drama, creating a dreamy though realistic narrative sprinkled liberally with fantasy. Spacey has never been better; his range and delivery are amazing. Equally deft supporting work from Bening, Suvari, and Cooper, with Birch and Bentley creating a lovely, nuanced young couple that is rooted in their individual and collective uniqueness. A fiercely strong debut for director Mendes.",Null,2,3,13 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," **** out of ****; Grade: A
","Spielberg's rightfully lauded WWII masterpiece gives war several faces, both ugly and beautiful.  A wonderful cast, led by Hanks in a career-best performance (not an easy claim to make), gorgeous cinematography, and a hauntingly realistic script make for a shattering experience to be appreciated, studied, and educated with.  The opening sequence has rightfully already become a classic.  Unnecessary bookends are a minor flaw in this major accomplishment.",Null,0,0,6 July 2000
Casualties of War," *** out of ****; Grade: B
","One of DePalma's first forays into 'serious' filmmaking is this war story set in Vietnam, involving assorted cruelties perpetrated by a group of American soldiers on a female Vietnamese POW.  Awkwardly staged and told at times, but containing scenes of genuine power and terror.  The actors acquit themselves nicely, with Penn somehow maintaining a tight grasp on his hyperactive performance.  Breathtaking location work and a 'happy' ending nevertheless create a numbing, sad experience that one chooses to subject himself to rather than enjoy.",Null,0,0,6 July 2000
Scream 2," ***1/2 out of ****; Grade: B+
","Rare sequel that nearly matches it's predecessor, as the survivors of the first film experience more slayings and in-jokes when they go off to college.  Just as witty, and almost as scary as the original, with meatier character development and a razor-sharp performance from Cox. The conclusion is purposefully overwrought, and stands as the only noticeable flaw in an otherwise surprisingly enjoyable sequel.",Null,0,0,6 July 2000
Scream," ***1/2 out of ****; Grade: A-
","Rightfully imitated revival of the teen slasher flick follows a group of high school students through the usual threats and deaths, with a twist: they have seen many films just like the one they are starring in, and comment incessantly about what is happening.  Terrific film features a multi-talented cast, a witty, starmaking script by Williamson, and tense, perfect direction from Craven.  Very funny and very scary.  Followed by two sequels.",Null,0,0,6 July 2000
Mr. Holland's Opus," Overlong but effective epic
","Overlong but effective epic of the everyman, with Dreyfuss wonderful as the titular high school music teacher. Good period re-creation, and a nice turn by Headley as Holland's frustrated wife. A few of the subplots are unnecessary, but the inherent drama in Holland's growth as a father, husband, and educator clearly compensate.",10,1,3,13 January 2000
Casino," Scorsese creates a vivid sense of time and place-
","Scorsese creates a vivid sense of time and place, and gets terrific work from DeNiro, Pesci, and especially Stone in a career-best performance. The behind-the-scenes depictions of Las Vegas are amazing. The only flaw is that the film is at times too reminiscent of the director's own Goodfellas' (1990).  But when you're being reminded of such a fantastic film, is it really a flaw?",Null,1,2,13 January 2000
Goodfellas," Scorsese's rightfully lauded epic
","Scorsese's rightfully lauded epic about modern gangsters in New York. Brilliant, rapid-fire dialogue, stunning music and sets, and Oscar-calibre performances all around make this one of the finest films of the decade, and one of Scorsese's best.",Null,0,0,13 January 2000
