The Incredible Hulk," Overall not bad, but after Iron Man looks weak
","I decided to refresh memories about all films MCU reviews on them. And today is the turn of the loudest, the meanest and greenest hero - Hulk.
The film was released in the same year as the first Iron Man, but was not received as warmly. Box office failure and defeat from critics followed. Part of the movie deserved it. Weak plot and dynamics - general characteristics of the movies of the Hulk. There was also very little action, always a hallmark of the green giant. Yes and no villain points clearly not added. But the Incredible Hulk has its advantages, and the main, in my opinion, of them - Edward Norton and Liv Tyler.
Yes, Bruce banner and Betty Ross in their performance came out slightly cardboard, but that's the fault of the weak script, not the actors themselves. Norton and Tyler got the best they could out of him. When you look at them, you believe they love each other, but there will always be the Hulk between them. I also liked General Ross, played by William hurt. I really hope to see the Red Hulk someday. And Stan Lee, as always, is beautiful. And after the credits, Tony stark appears.
The film as a whole is worthy of viewing. Hopefully, we'll see more solo films about the Hulk.",6,0,0,4 September 2019
Iron Man 2," Weaker than the original, but not as bad as it could be
","After the release of the first Iron Man and his enormous success, many were looking forward to the sequel. And in 2010 came the long-awaited sequel, and it disappointed many. Instead of showing the consequences of Stark's disclosure of the mystery of personality, the authors forced him to reflect on the near death (and do absolutely nothing!). Villains are like that. Mickey Rourke is charismatic, but as cartoonish as possible. Just a typical Russian in a Western film, although the phrase 'Tvoy soft - govno' is very funny in the context of the scene. From pros can be be noted the best image Nick Fury from all MCU films, jobs good action, and, of course, Scarlett Johansson. You can also say thank you for a good rhodey/war machine performed by Don Cheadle (sorry, Terrence Howard).

Captain America: The First Avenger," Good, but silly
","So I got to the first solo film about one of the main characters of Marvel Comics and all American pop culture - Stephen Rogers, also known as Captain America. I never really liked this character, but after seeing him in 'the Avengers' in 2012, I decided to get acquainted with his films. And you know, this movie is really stupid, kind of like the first Spider-Man from Sam Raimi. Chris Evans doesn't annoy me as much as Tobey Maguire does... Okay, I got carried away, back to Cap.
Looks the film well. The atmosphere of war and America of that time is tolerably transferred. The effects also do not cause facepalm. The plot, as I said, is a bit silly, just like in the old comics.
The main character of the film, Steve Rogers-a typical hero, nothing more to say.
Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) at first seems like a typical female character, but gradually reveals new sides, and when you see her emotions, her experiences at the time of Steve's 'death' in the ice, you believe it without question. And in the series she is generally fine. And besides, Hayley is such a woman that... Again I was carried away.
The main antagonist of the film, the Red Skull performed by Hugo 'Agent Elrond Smith' Weaving terribly caricatured, though it looks good.
Watch can be, but his, as and many films MCU, not very want to revise.",7,0,1,14 September 2019
Thor," Good story, but weak graphics
","So I got to the first movie about the mighty thunder God Thor. To read it I decided, oddly enough, after watching 'Dark World'. And at first this movie I liked the first, but about it later. To me personally, the first 'Thor' seemed boring, but at the same time interesting. The plot and motivation of the characters spelled out very well, but otherwise the film is very lame. Asgard is drawn very poorly, I can not believe that you see a real huge world. Also extremely crumpled redemption and awareness of the Thor, as well as too spontaneous development of the relationship with Jane Foster. Very weak, though not bad, villain. Let's go through the characters.
Thor (Chris Hemsworth) played well. He is arrogant, arrogant and proud, as befits an almost omnipotent God. But, suddenly deprived of his strength in the face of danger because of his ego, he gradually re-educates himself, finds his love and proves the right to be worthy of his strength.
Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is a controversial character for me. On the one hand, I really like Natalie as an actress. On the other, the character does not cling, and the relationship with Thor, as I said, it's too spontaneous.
Chief, for me, plus this movie-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He's very motivated. He had a little envy for my brother, so it is also One lied to all my life! And although his plan to seize power in Asgard, to put it mildly, strange, charisma and great game Tom cover everything.
The film is weak, but not bad.",6,0,5,14 September 2019
It Chapter Two," Just fine, but a little predictable.
","After watching the first part, which I really liked, I was looking forward to the sequel, though I knew about what it will be (the book and the mini-series 1990 make themselves felt). Mostly I was interested in adult versions of the characters. And, you know, they're insanely good. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader and others (sorry, don't remember the names of the actors) - they played just great and, most importantly, when you look at them, I see those same kids from the first film. Well, Bill Skarsgard was quite good, although I still think that Tim Curry coped with the role of clown (namely clown) much better. Separately, I want to praise the director of the film Andres Muschetti. He has a lot of talent and I hope he has a great Hollywood future ahead of him. Picture, music, screamers (though not all) - all at the highest level. The plot, of course, strange, but that's all Stephen king
Everyone who liked the first part, like this movie.",9,0,0,14 September 2019
Iron Man," A great start to something grand
","One of the best film comics in history, the resurrection of Robert Downey Jr. as an actor, the origin of the Marvel Cinatic Universe, a milestone in the history of the genre - all this can be said about the first Iron Man. His exit was a big risk, but the result exceeded all expectations. The film became a giant hit, and it was thanks to him that there was such a giant franchise as MCU. Me personally, the movie also loved it (unlike its sequels, but about them later). Effects, plot, acting, character motivation-all at the highest level. The cherry on this magnificent cake, of course, was its main character-Tony stark performed by Robert Downey Jr.
I recommend the film to everyone 10/10.",10,0,1,4 September 2019
