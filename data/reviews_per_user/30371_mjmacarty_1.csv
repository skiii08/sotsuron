Mission: Impossible III," Horrible.
","Mindless. Cruise reminds me of a wooden Indian. Don't believe the full-page ads. Same story, new budget. Hello, is there no imagination left among screenplay writers? Did they think the previous two movies hadn't quite explored these plot themes thoroughly enough? It was a serious struggle to sit through this painfully formulaic (or should I say methodic) waste of money and resources. I rolled my eyes so many times I could barely stand at the end. Imagine telling your wife 'I work for the IMF--that stands for Impossible Mission Force'. GAG! Actually if there hadn't been feeble attempts at character development, the movie may have been slightly better, not to mention about 30 boring minutes shorter.",2,3,11,12 May 2006
