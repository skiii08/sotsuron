The Blair Witch Project," The best horror film of the past thirty years.
","In the woods, alone, at Night.  Not night, Night.  Noises off in the distance.  And someone, or some Thing, is coming.The Blair Witch Project is the best film released so far this year, and the scariest horror film since Night of the Living Dead.  Yes.That said, it is a film that requires a little work.  You must believe what the filmmakers are showing you, and cynicism has very little place here. Don't get up for popcorn, and don't go to the bathroom, because you'll break that fragile bubble that you need to see the film in.  I'm telling you, this film will SCARE you!  I haven't had that happen to me in forever.Enjoy, because some Thing is coming.  Oh, yes.",10,1,2,18 July 1999
Fight Club," Fight Club is a kick-out-the-jams movie drug of the year
","This film demands to be seen twice, and it is not for everyone.  If you saw Double Jeopardy and marveled at the wit and intelligence of the screenplay (SARCASM ALERT) then this film is not for you.Personally, I loved Fight Club and I thought it is the best film of the year, so far.The plot, which can't be revealed in any great detail so as not to spoil the surprises of the movie, is basically about a character (referred to in the credits as the Narrator) played by Edward Norton, who has had it with the corporate Single Serving life and finds a new thing with Brad Pitt, who plays Tyler Durden.This movie is violent, but not senselessly so.  Each scene has a point, or as my drama teacher used to say, 'Each scene turns a corner.'  The corners this movie turns are pretty remarkable.  If this film doesn't have you questioning your life, you must be extremely rich and successful.  For those of us who are not (99%), this is a breath of fresh air.This and Iron Giant give me hope abut Hollywood again.  And this year isn't over yet...we still have The Messenger, Dogma, Being John Malkovich, The Insider, Sleepy Hollow, The Green Mile, etc. to look forward to.
YOU ARE NOT YOUR JOB.  YOU ARE NOT THE CONTENTS OF YOUR WALLET.  YOU ARE NOT YOUR F*****G KHAKIS.  YOU ARE NOT AN ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE SNOWFLAKE.",10,0,1,27 October 1999
Jaws," One of the best horror films ever made.
","This film still has the power to haunt you.  To terrify you.  Even today, in the post-Scream world.When I was five, my entire family - cousins too - packed into their pickup trucks to see this movie.  It is the ultimate fisherman's movie, and I come from a fisherman family.  I sat next to my dad, and asked him to tell me when the scary parts come.  My dad said, 'I haven't seen this either.  How will I know when the scary parts come?'  I implored him to let me know when he THOUGHT they might come.Guess what.  He didn't.  Thank you, Dad.This film stands the test of time, and I give it a 10.Also, does anyone know if Robert Shaw's Indianapolis speech was improvised? For years I've heard that it was.",10,1,2,28 July 1999
The Iron Giant," The Iron Giant is a Classic. It will live in you Forever.
","This film, this gem, moved me so much, that I'm tearing up as I write this. For once in your life, believe the hype.  It is genuine.  This is a great film.  Children and adults will love it, and it actually has something to say, about violence, about our choices in life, about how paranoia can blind you, and about not being what others cast you as being.  If Warner Bros. does Superman, they need to watch this movie REPEATEDLY before they get a script.  If anything, this film evokes the true feelings of those comics. You MUST see Iron Giant.  If you let the summer go without making this film a success, the studio mentality has won.  We can't allow that.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
