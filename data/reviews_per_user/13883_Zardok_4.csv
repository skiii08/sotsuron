Requiem for a Dream," disturbingly powerful
","Much like 'Leaving Las Vegas', which also deals with addiction, this film relies on disturbing and shocking elements from which to draw its power and effectiveness. No, I didn't think it is a film with a 'just say no' message. Neither this is a 'Trainspotting' clone, because here you are not an outsider taking a journey with a psychedelic twist through the world of heroin-addicts, but are, on the other hand, thrown right in, without the safety line. 'Requiem for a Dream' is an 'as is' portrayal of drug addiction and its consequences, most of which you will recognize, as they have been done before. (Minor spoilers for the next paragraph)The descent to prostitution ('The Panic in Needle Park') for example, and the reality of the so-called socially-acceptable drugs ('doctor please, some more of these, outside the door, she took four more, what a drag it is getting old'). But the way in which the subject matter is dealt with is very original and effective, because it's right-in-your-face, shocking, and I think there's hardly anyone who will leave undisturbed or unmoved. Whether you want to be disturbed and shocked, nevertheless, is another question.",Null,1,1,13 June 2001
The Bridge on the River Kwai," excellent
","Bridge on the River Kwai is an excellent film. It succeeds where recently made movies like Thin Red Line failed: it shows the awful madness that is war without the blood and guts element, which, by the way, almost always misses the mark. War is insane not because of what it does to our bodies but because of what it does to our minds. Great performances from William Holden and Alec Guinness. Definitely worth seeing at least once.",9,1,3,8 September 2001
Thirteen Days," no.... really???
","This movie depicts, in very general terms, the story everyone knows. At times inaccurately. In a film like that, it is good to have  a strong subplot. Just to make things a bit more personal, you know. The way it is, I doubt many people will actually sit at the edge of their chairs (especially given Russia's current state of affairs) biting their nails in suspense. Excepting those who have lived through that historical horror show. Steven Culp is a dead-ringer for Bobby Kennedy, whom he portrays. Bruce Greenwood is unbelievable as JFK. And Kevin Costner is, as always, great as Kevin Costner. Interestingly enough, while at the Soviet Embassy, Costner exchanges words with a woman, who is just as terrified as the Americans. That was a hint on a plot I would care to see. Maybe in the 70's or even 80's, a one-sided view like this, at a crisis of such humongous proportions, would have gone over well. But in 2000, when the enemy doesn't even exist, it's unforgiveable. Of course, the real facts and what actually went on on the Soviet side will probably forever remain a mystery, but who says you can't use your imagination?",Null,0,1,24 August 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Bravo!
","This is one amazing film. Everything fits: superb acting, great music, and the odd-ball of a plot. I have to admit, I was expecting much less, but the movie turned out to be a real gem. 10/10",10,0,0,17 August 2001
