The Blair Witch Project," The words, 'Don't Believe the Hype!' come to mind...
","I'll grant that Myrick and Sanchez have done quite a bit for $40,000, but better films have been made for less ('El Mariachi' -$7,000 & 'Clerks' -$27,000), and those films required writing ability, they didn't rely on the initial confusion and HYPE created by passing the flick off as actual documentary footage. The basis of this film's financial success will be on the curiosity-seekers scurrying to see what all the fuss is about.There are holes in this story large enough to steam cargo ships through. Most of these revolve around the character's motivations. If you're shooting what attempts to pass itself off as a documentary, your characters shouldn't behave like teenaged exploitation slasher-flick cut-outs with slightly more urban dialog. But hey, if Myrick and Sanchez live up to the overly blow-dried, Calvin Klein undies Ad image they adopted for their Village Voice interview you can see where 'Style-Over-Substance' might be more their schtick.The nice thing about filmmakers like Myrick and Sanchez is that we won't likely hear from them after their second commercial outing, as they won't have much to say beyond their first gimmick. But the collective intelligence of groups is questionable and they my prove to be Masters of the Hype (ala Jerry Springer,Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, numerous political pundits) and stretch a long and profitable career out of producing very little in a very large way.",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
