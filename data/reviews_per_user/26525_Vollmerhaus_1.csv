Deja Vu," Pretty good
","This is my first comment on a film here at IMDb. Saw this movie yesterday and here is my verdict on it. This is an exciting movie, but not one to remember for too long. Interesting plot if you can overlook the fact that space-and time travel is made a bit easy in this film. Cool action scenes, especially when the present and the past is mixed in some of them, along with good acting by Washington and Kilmer is two of the movies strong points. Has always I wish they could have made a different ending that wasn't so typical Hollywood. That would have been a surprise All in all it is an 2 hour enjoyable action/science-fiction movie.",6,2,4,14 January 2007
