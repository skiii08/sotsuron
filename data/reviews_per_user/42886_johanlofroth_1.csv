Marie Antoinette," Very thin.
","Just had a boring look at it..This is almost the worst film i ever seen. Poor lighting and sound, and Miss Coppola didn't do her job on this movie, refund me please. Sometimes it seems that they had problems to get the actors something to say. The hole story is VERY thin and the the story that remains is told very bad. Is the film about Versailles or about Marie ????? What about Maries death ? And the death of her son and husband (the king)??I really hope that Miss Coppola does something better with her life than this kind of movies.BAD BAD BAD.Johan, Sweden.",2,0,1,22 February 2007
