"I Love You, Man"," Smart and funny, above the average comedy.
","Unconventional movie, yet in a conventional way. Paul Rudd plays a normal guy living his normal life, but as soon as he gets engaged he realizes he has no close male friends that vouch for being his best man. He then goes on a series of funny and not very well succeeded man-dates searching for a new friend. Won't say more as I intend this to be a non-spoiler review.Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are great on this movie. The plot line is a bit predictable, but the movie is smart and funny. And that's what comedy movies are all about. More than just attracting a few laughs, this film makes us think that even though it may seem hard to make new friends after we're grown ups, there is no secret recipe to do it, but a clich√©: 'just be yourself'.In a nutshell, smart and above the average comedy, worth watching.",6,0,1,12 February 2011
Batman Begins," Darker and better than the Dark Knight
","With a great cast of characters and working with a script that had the correct formula, director Christopher Nolan was able to successfully recreate the famous comics hero and please most of the public and fans. After the letdown of the previous batman movies, Batman Begins tells the tale of young Bruce Wayne becoming the Batman.*** Light Spoiler alert **** This isn't a movie that starts from nowhere and ends without continuity. On the contrary, it starts from the very beginning, from Bruce Wayne's childhood, displaying his relationship with his parents and their murder. Young Wayne goes through existential crisis and a long journey throughout the world, facing dangers and undergoing physical and mental training. Meanwhile, his desire to save Gotham City, a city falling apart with crime, grows stronger. Bruce then comes back to his hometown to fight against its rising underworld. The path he goes through until finally assuming the identity of the batman is well explored in this film, which focuses on the hero and not on the villains. The ending is simple, but fantastic.Overall, a serious movie that deserves to be applauded for being the best executed and darkest of the whole series. Much better than the Dark Knight in my opinion. It's worth mentioning the great acting of Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard. Also, Christian Bale shows a lot of competence and is very convincing as the Batman.",9,2,3,30 May 2011
Downfall," Ganz's acting is frightening and fantastic
","The movie shows the last moments of the famous Nazi dictator before his suicide on April 30th 1945 in a bunker in Berlin. The film starts 10 days before Hitler's fall and director Oliver Hirschbiegel shows the desperation of the Germans, including the Nazi officers, as Berlin is invaded and bombarded by heavy artillery. Facing chaos, the characters break down one by one in their desperate measures.Bruno Ganz's acting is frightening and fantastic. Everything from accurately nailing Hitler's accent to his imposing authority and yelling in scene is surprising. Ganz was nominated for best actor in the European Film Awards (he really deserved it) and the movie was nominated for best international film in that year. It gets 8 stars from me as the movie itself is quite exhausting - could have been briefer. But the point of view is great and it's not another American nationalist film.",8,1,2,30 May 2011
The Terminal," Spielberg + Hanks = WIN
","Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a citizen of an Eastern European country who travels to New York when his country is suddenly struck by a coup d'etat, which invalidates his passport. When he gets to the terminal, Viktor is unable to get clearance to enter the US. Once the borders of his home country get closed after the overthrow he can't go back home either.Viktor has to improvise and starts spending his days and nights inside the terminal waiting for a political resolution. As time goes by, the protagonist is forced to find his way to survive, struggling to communicate and to make friends, while trying to work out a resolution for his unusual situation.A drama with a light touch of humor in which once again the Spielberg + Hanks combination is an utter success. The script is good and flows through smoothly, whereas Hanks gives us another amazing display of his talent. Navorski's unusual situation is based on a true story of an Iranian refugee stuck in Charles de Gaulle airport.",9,1,3,30 May 2011
