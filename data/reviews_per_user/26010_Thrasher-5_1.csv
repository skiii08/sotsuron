The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch Funny?
","Before seeing it, I had read a few positive reviews, and I could not help but hear the positive buzz, but I was on the fence about seeing it.  Then I checked its website, and that piqued my interest.After seeing it, I can say I did not like this movie.  First, there's no way it could live up to the hype.  And second, I did not buy into it.  I didn't find it scary at all, except for the last 5 minutes.  The dialogue was pretty lame, and they overused the 'F' word.I do give it credit for being original and unlike anything I've ever seen before.I was surprised to find some parts of it funny!  Some one-liners received lots of laughs from the audience.",2,0,1,8 August 1999
