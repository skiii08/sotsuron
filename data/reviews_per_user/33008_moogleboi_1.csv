The Avengers," A stupid film guised by big budget action to wow the masses.
","I probably sound like an grumpy twit with a title like this, but I'm the sort that enjoys most, if not all cinema. I was a little bit surprised that I didn't enjoy this... in fact, I thought it was pretty poor.Yes, the action was cool, but after tolerating an hour of poor script; an hour or so of flat-out action wasn't going to cut it for me. I ended up sat there waiting for New York to be destroyed enough that I could leave the cinema.One of the main issues is that dialogue tries too hard to be witty and falls flat; then the serious conversations are just too melodramatic and overtly clich√©. I was sat cringing whenever Thor or Loki were talking.Possibly the only part of the movie I genuinely enjoyed was to finally see the oh-so crap antagonist be slung back and forth in to the floor by hulk. Mainly just so I didn't have to watch him open his mouth.Whilst subjectively I think this movie is crap, the action is some of the best Hollywood is capable of churning out; though it's annoying that this film will probably take an undeserved place on the IMDb top 250 over this. It's a poor unoriginal movie caked in explosions, pretty CGI and whatnot- thus this means that everyone will automatically love it...What's worse is the sequel sneak-peak mid-point in the credits; for me it just translated to 'Hollywood wants more of your money to waste on ---- like this'.",1,50,150,2 May 2012
