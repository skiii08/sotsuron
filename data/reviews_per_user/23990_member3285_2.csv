Catch Me If You Can," A very fun, very entertaining film
","Steven Spielberg seemed to falter with the overblown 'A.I.' - but since then, he's made two great films.  Minority Report is a science-fiction classic, and now he's made a chase-caper film that's almost as good in its own way.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives an excellent performance (definitely better than in Titanic) and Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken are also great - as usual.  This is a fun and entertaining movie, but it's not forgettable or mindless, as many fun films are.",9,1,2,5 February 2003
Final Destination 2," Great death sequences within a mediocre film
","Final Destination 2 is not high art; nor is it particularly funny or dramatic.  Yet several intricate and often very tense death sequences and an amazing sequence of car crashes make at least portions of this movie quite memorable.  The acting is mediocre, the script is routine, but the special effects and unabashed gore actually help make this movie pretty good.",7,0,0,5 February 2003
