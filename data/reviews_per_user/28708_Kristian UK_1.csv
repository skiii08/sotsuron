Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worth watching for the ending!!!
","For those of you who hated Jar Jar Binks and wished for him to meet some gruesome end that would turn even Jabba The Hut's stomach, well, I seem to remember wishing exactly that on C3P0 when first seeing star wars. So if you kinda ignore Jar Jar, the movie is pretty darn good and I must say, the ending matched any Star Wars movie, which is more than I can say for 'Attack Of The Clones'.",Null,0,1,27 May 2002
