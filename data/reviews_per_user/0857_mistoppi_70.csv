Whip It," Touching, thrilling & delighting!
","I got curious about this movie because I've been interested in roller derby (while the last time I roller skated was around time when I was 7-10, oops), because the movie has so many women on it, and lastly because ZoÃ« Bell is in the film. It's always a pleasure to see her work on screen, whether it's acting or stunts.While I've never been into sports, or sport films, I loved Whip It! The matches between the leagues were so intense and thrilling! I'm so delighted because of how many women were in this film, not just the characters but the director and writer as well. And there are so many different kind of female characters in the story, all having their own ideologies, all having different personalities. There are characters who are so typical good characters, but they are still interesting. There are assertive women, violent women, competitive women, mean women, nice women, mothers, daughters... So many different kind of characters. It's almost rare, because so many films have around 80 % male characters. The structure of this film may be quite predictable, but the other qualities of Whip It make up for that - the story is emotional in many different ways, and it's just fun to watch. And after all, isn't most of Hollywood pretty predictable these days? And the story has many different levels, it's not just about the sport. It's about the main character Bliss growing up, it's about her relationships with her parents, her friends, the friends and rivals she makes while playing roller derby. And while the main point of the film is Bliss finding her passion and what makes her happy, the story doesn't forget all the other details that push her forward or pull her back.The music was well chosen. It keeps the viewer psyched, and the songs work when you're listening to them outside of the movie. I have several of them on my playlists.Simply put, Whip It is an amazing movie. It touches, thrills and delights. There's only one thing I'd change, and it would be deleting most of the useless heterosexual romances and add some women loving women there. It would suit the film and make it so much more better, but I'm happy with what I got.",9,5,7,19 April 2016
If I Stay," I am so disappointed
","I learnt about this movie in school in English class that was all about movies. Two girls made their analysis on this film. I only saw the trailer, but it was enough to convince me to see this film if I ever had the chance.But boy am I disappointed! I expected something way more from this film. Of course it's deep, it has important meaning. Mia is an amazing characters many people will see themselves in. But the thing is, no one can truly, truly feel like they are Mia, if they haven't been in a life or death situation before. So it feels like a waste of character. There could've been another story about Mia, amazing Mia with her talents, who doesn't even know how amazing she is. There are other stories you could put her in so people could truly feel her. But having her in weird ghost fantasy was kind of a waste, especially when this kind of story seems so typical. Has this been done before because I feel like I've seen a similar movie but with less interesting main character?One of the things I hate about this film is the dialogue. Almost immediately when Adam talked with Mia I had to sigh and roll my eyes. No teenage boy talks like that! That pretentious dialogue is so annoying to listen to. It suits with some romantic sappy novels you read in rainy day, hoping you'll meet your significant other, not in a movie. I don't know if I can excuse it if the dialogue was that bad in the novel. It's like some unrealistic fantasy, and it bothers me. Does someone actually watch a movie like that and then hope they'll meet a guy who talks in poetic pretentiousness? Ugh!And I really expected this to be the kind of movie you could watch and cry so long you're kind of cleansed, but no. That's the thing I'm most disappointed about. This movie didn't move me at all! I'm mostly blaming the writing for that. I can't really judge right now, but usually I'm very impressed by Chloe Grace Moretz. She's a talented young actress. She was very convincing as Mia, she was astonishing. She displays emotions well, no matter how 'bad' they might look in front of a camera. That's what I love about her acting.I loved the music in this film, but if it's a movie about music then... Then it's kind of obvious you have to have good music there. There was both classical music and punk rock. It's the same kind of contrast that was between Mia and Adam. As I said before, this movie is very deep and it has an important meaning. It struggles with several themes that may not be important in general, it's not like this movie has a political message. No, the message is mostly for individuals. And even if the horrid dialogue makes you shiver, If I Stay really makes you think about several things the movie mentions. You don't have to agree with the message, but at least you think about it.If I Stay was definitely not for me. If you love movies about teenagers that are actually deep, this is for you. If you don't care about writing too much, this movie might be for you. Obviously If I Stay has an audience that loves it, and it's definitely meant for someone. If I stay is deep, the message is amazing and it's probably even emotional movie when it hits the right person. If you are sure you won't like it, don't bother. But if you think there might be a chance you'll love this movie, take that chance.",4,0,0,1 March 2016
In Bruges," Not what I expected, but excellent!!
","I've seen one other movie from Martin McDonagh: Seven Psychopaths. That one happens to be in one of my top 5 favourite movies, so I thought I'd see something else from Martin McDonagh, since the guy seems to know what he's doing. He's an excellent writer, and it can be seen in In Bruges as well. McDonagh is phenomenal at writing dialogue. It's natural yet colourful, and while it might not be the most politically correct, it works, and no one is trying to convince that the characters of this movie would be extremely good people. Still the moral code of the characters is interesting. They are hit men, criminals, yet killing an innocent little boy is clearly wrong, and all of them seem to agree on that. The view of some of them might just be harder than others'.The music affects this movie a lot. In the beginning the dialogue sounds more like a comedy, but the music makes the whole thing feel like a weird European drama. The copy I rented just had the genre 'comedy' listed in the back, nothing else, and the beginning gave me a lot of mixed feelings about that, since the beginning seems rather serious - apart from the dialogue. Other than that, the music mostly amplified the feeling of the movie at every point, the beginning just stands out if you're not prepared.But is this film really a comedy? Well, if it is, it certainly isn't the typical simple joke kind of funny. It's extremely dark funny. I was actually surprised at what kind of stuff I found myself chuckling at. this shows how wide the comedy genre actually is, since it includes typical comedies such as 21 Jump Street, not too funny but cheerful movies like The Grand Budapest Hotel and then really dark comedies like In Bruges and Death to Smoochy.In Bruged wasn't what I expected, considering the quite crappy description behind the DVD cover. Still I enjoyed it, however it was quite slow sometimes. Still, the story is intriguing and so are the characters. Definitely worth seeing!",8,1,2,7 May 2016
Inglourious Basterds," A brilliant movie, managed to surpass my extremely high expectations
","I feel like all my Tarantino reviews start like this, but I remember seeing the beginning of this film when I was younger. And like every film, my dad showed me that piece. He was mostly showing it to prove how good Tarantino's soundtracks are. And that's the first thing I noticed about Inglourious Basterds. The soundtrack definitely does it job. The film is thrilling on its own, yet the soundtrack made that thrill even better. And I am very glad to hear some David Bowie on Tarantino's work. I'm starting to think Tarantino is my musical soul mate.Even when you know about history, you're still very excited to find out what happens, and how the assassination plots turn out. Of course history doesn't seem to mean anything to QT, which means the story develops into something I wasn't expecting. In a way, this is way better. We all know how history goes. Any movie is a fantasy, and unless it's a documentary or a biography, why should we give a damn how it really went down? Another thing I like about the story is how the two plots overlap. You sit there watching and wondering if the two sides ever find out about each other. It's an interesting concept. The characters are interesting. They are people with different personalities, different kind of back stories, yet their paths happen to cross. Well, I can't be so sure about the Nazi characters, they didn't seem that interesting - but was that on purpose, on accident or just me? I guess either of those three would tell a lot. But of course Cristoph Waltz' character Col. Hans Landa is very interesting. You start to feel like he'd be one of the most loyal people, yet he's ready to betray all the Nazi leaders if he gets what he wants out if it. That's kind of a plot twist, yet it's not too surprising. How loyal can anyone really be in the end? But almost every character adds something very interesting to the story. Raine, Shoshanna, Donowitz, Hammersmark, Hicox, Stiglitz... They are all very interesting characters, yet it's only Landa I can write about the most. It's his motives that interest me.I always hate those American war movies where everyone speaks English but just with accent. I thought Inglourious Basterds would be the same. It was a mystery if it would be so good I could forgive the excessive use of English but no! Of course people speak English in Inglourious Basterds, but only when it makes sense at least to some extent. Inglourious Basterds is mostly in German and French. Thank god for that!Of course I don't have too much experience with war movies, but I've always kind of assumed the violent to be different from typical action movies. Well, of course in a Tarantino war movie the violence is how he does it best.It's interesting how this movie portrays propaganda films made in Nazi Germany. Well 'portray' is not the right word, because there aren't a lot of ways to portray propaganda. But knowing what kind of film enthusiastic QT is makes it interesting trying to see if you can get his views on propaganda out of the film. It would be an interesting thing to discover and analyse some more.Inglourious Basterds is a brilliant movie, and it surpassed my expectations, no matter how high they happened to be. I have to say I've chosen my favourite director well.",10,2,5,22 January 2016
Zootopia," Surprisingly good!
","I'm not usually into Disney. Everything is too soft for me. I like a few, mostly because I saw them when I was a kid and they make me nostalgic. I rented this mostly because there was a sale and if you rented five movies you could have them for a week for seven euros, and it was a bargain, and I remembered my sister wanted to see this at least at one point. I did want to see this for a few reasons. One of them was that people mostly said it was great. Another was that Jason Bateman was in this movie. Now I'm not his biggest fan or anything, but I've watched enough Arrested Development to like him. So, what the hell, I watched it.I was so pleasantly surprised. What's the highest rating I've given a children's animated movie? The Lego Movie, which was awesome, and I gave it 9 / 10. Zootropolis doesn't come close to The Lego Movie, but Zootropolis is great. It is funny, and it is actually super thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen, and what had happened, and all that. It also has just the perfect amount of scary. I'm glad I watched this.Of course there are few things that bother me like why isn't Disney using voice actors instead of some random Hollywood live action actors and actresses. Like sure, they get more viewers, but there are amazing voice actors and actresses out there, who could be magical in a movie like this. Now it's mostly like 'hey, that dude sounds familiar' and maybe recognising one actor (Tommy Chong). It's not like the cast is bad but... why can't you use people who will definitely, absolutely do a great job?Also this movie could be a great metaphor for racism and all kind of prejudice, but it's a bit... weird. It's mixed. First it seems that everyone is pushing the prey down, but in the end everyone is awful towards PREDATORS, like hey, maybe don't be prejudice against that huge ass beast who could murder you and eat you. If you are a tiny bunny, you kind of have the right to be scared of a jaguar or whatever. Maybe you're not supposed to think about these animals as humans, but still you are kind of telling kids hey, that person who bullies you and hurts you? They have their own issues going on. Sure, they might have some issues of their own, but that doesn't make it okay... I don't know where I'm going with this, but this situation kind of bothers me.But other than those things, this movie is surprisingly good. Like I said, super thrilling yet fun. I really like this movie.",8,3,6,1 January 2017
Shaun of the Dead," One of my favourite horror comedies!
","I've seen one movie by Edgar Wright before, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. It's a great movie, but I didn't expect this movie to be anything like that, of course. Well, to be honest, since I am so used to Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, it was a surprise for me how violent this movie turned out to be, even though that should be obvious when we're dealing with a movie of this genre. I didn't know much about this film before seeing it, apart from it having zombies in it, and that really doesn't tell anything. Still, I assumed this would be like Zombieland, except a few British spices.Of course this movie is quite similar to Zombieland, or rather Zombieland is similar to Shaun of the Dead. However, Shaun of the Dead has several things that make it better than Zombieland. The humour is very different in Shaun of the Dead. It seems more... British. And Shaun of the Dead has a lot scarier moments. While Zombieland is funny action almost all through the movie, Shaun of the Dead has situations that feel almost hopeless, and you are actually terrified for the characters. With Zombieland that doesn't work, because it's such a typical movie you don't really even bother to think something would happen to the characters. It's just not that type of movie. But something about Shaun of the Dead makes you think there's no certainty anyone will survive. The funniest thing about this movie is how slowly everyone notices that there are zombies. The audience can of course see it, and it's almost annoying how the characters ignore everything happening around them. It's funny because it could really happen. Come on, how long would it take from us to see what's happening?Shaun of the Dead is now probably my favourite zombie movie. The plot might be typical for a zombie themed film, but that doesn't matter. It's violent, it's funny and while it might be slightly predictable, it's still entertaining to watch. This might be tied with Jennifer's Body as my favourite horror comedy I got on this ship too late, but if there's someone out there who still hasn't seen this film, watch it! If you're not put off by violence and zombies, you won't regret it.",9,1,4,22 March 2016
Hostel," Extremely violent, therefore exactly what you'd want in a movie like this
","One of my friends talked about she'd want to watch movies by Eli Roth, but they are so full of gore she couldn't stand it. Then another friend mention she liked Hostel. I was torn between two options: I'd watch Hostel with the chance I might throw up or worse, or not watch it and feel like I missed out on something. I took the chance of throwing up, but I didn't!First of all, it takes quite a while before all the torturing starts. And that's magnificent, because the opening credits hint of violence, so even if you'd watch this movie without knowing anything about it, you know something horrible is about to happen. But it doesn't happen right away and you just have to follow these three guys being gross and annoying, and you're just wondering when the torturing is going to start. And the longer it goes on, the more frustrating it is. You want the violence to start, so you can get it over with. The waiting is the most frustrating part about it, and Eli Roth handles that wonderfully. The characters of this movie are annoying. They are very gross and to be honest, during the start of the movie I was hoping they'd all die. And I didn't like them at any point of the movie. They were the typical characters in a horror movie. You want to yell at them because they don't see the imminent danger ahead of them. Still. I didn't want them to be tortured to death, so during the most suspenseful part I was on the edge of my seat, hoping they'd survive all that. About the suspenseful parts, wow! They were so thrilling I don't think I've ever been that thrilled while watching a horror movie. The suspense was killing me! It was so excellently written and shot, wow.I will always praise horror movies for their dialogue. Especially in the beginning the dialogue is so ordinary, because nothing horrible is happening yet. It's real, it's the kind of dialogue you hear every day, and I love it, because while all the torture is going down, how realistic or amazing can dialogue be anyhow?Hostel is the first movie of this type that I've seen, but I love it! Of course these kind of movies don't have much substance or themes or anything like that, but that's not what they are for!",9,1,2,11 April 2016
Oldboy," Shocking! A must-see, if you have the stomach for it
","To be hones I'm in a shock right now. The story of Oldboy is absolutely horrible. And no, I don't mean it's written badly, I mean the story is so horrifying that after I was done I just had to sit and stare the screen for a while. The only thought in my head is: 'What the hell did I just see?' This is the beauty of movies with clever plot twists that actually do surprise you: Oldboy, Primal Fear, Fight Club... I'm sure there are many more, but just making a list would be lazy. The plot twist in Primal Fear is just surprising. It's clever, but the thing is, it's not that bad. while Oldboy... That plot twist is absolutely shocking. And the story is well written even when you don't count the plot twist. The main character's narration gives a lot more interest to the story. The mystery is intriguing, and the writers have a way of keeping the viewer invested in the story. Even when you don't really like Oh Dae-Su, you still want to know why. And even Oh Dae-Su is not really a likable character, you still wonder if he deserved that. That would be an interesting philosophical debate.There are a few group fight scenes in this film, and they are excellent. They are well coordinated and enjoyable (or as enjoyable as fight scenes are) to watch. The visual side of Oldboy amazes with how good it looks when it needs to. There were few gore-y scenes, yet nothing too horrifying was shown, so something was left to imagination. Still those scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.Oldboy is a very well made movie. It's shocking, and I'm not sure how good it is when you watch it a second time, but at least after this first time I am astonished - and shocked. I'd love to recommend this movie but I don't know how risky that would be.",8,2,3,20 February 2016
127 Hours," Its strengths are its weaknesses
","127 Hours is an interesting movie because its strengths can also be its weaknesses. It's slow, not much happens and it is weirdly surreal. It depends on the audience how it's received. I actually thought this movie would rely more heavily on flashbacks than the actual situation the main character is in. It's better this way. While the cinematography and soundtrack are amazing, this movie still feels a bit weird because of how slow it is. It's very thrilling, very agonising, and it's pace makes it even worse - which makes it of course better.",6,1,1,27 March 2017
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Entertaining and cute
","I like the idea that both characters are not 100 % into the relationship forming between them, but not for the usual reasons. Both are doing it for their job, but their goals are the opposite. And it's hilarious for the viewer to watch them struggling with what they got themselves into. Andie's driving Ben crazy, but Ben doesn't want to give up on the bet, so he tries to hold on to Andie, which frustrates her. The tension is amazing.A lot of things in this film were pretty generic. The soundtrack is generic, so are the characters and the structure. But then again, in romantic comedies it's kind of good we can trust the structure to be similar. We don't watch romantic comedies to see an amazing art film, it's for fun and crying your eyes out if you need to. (This one didn't make that happen though.) The dialogue is also very generic, but! There was one specific piece of Dialogue I really enjoyed. It was when Andie and Ben first met. They mostly used one word lines, like 'Unattached?' 'Currently.' 'Likewise.' 'Surprising.' I love that dialogue! It's so simplified! And that's what makes it amusing. It's also a kind of smart way to show how they are testing the waters. Neither of them is actually looking for serious relationship. Andie is looking for a normal guy she can hook and then destroy. Ben is looking for someone he can make fall in love with him. So why use long sentences when just trying to check if the other one seems alright for the 'mission'?But How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is an amusing film. It's entertaining and kind of cute. It's predictable, sure, and the writing is not the best, yet even though it's surprisingly long, it doesn't frustrate you, at least during the first view.",6,1,1,8 February 2016
Hot Fuzz," I'm ashamed of thinking Hot Fuzz might be more boring than Shaun of the Dead
","Last night I said how the only thing I knew about Shaun of the Dead was it has zombies in it? Well, the only thing I knew about Hot Fuzz was how it has cops in it. And I think that's less defining than zombies. For some reason I also thought Hot Fuzz would be the most boring out of the 'Cornetto trilogy', but I was proved wrong. I enjoyed Hot Fuzz at least at much as I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead.I assumed Pegg and Frost playing pretty much the same characters in every movie, but they were surprisingly different. It was hard to imagine Simon Pegg as a plausible bad ass cop, but he rocked that part. Nick Frost's character had some similar qualities to his character in Shaun of the Dead, but he was able to make too slightly similar characters appear distinct on the screen. The cinematography in Edgar Wright's movies is amazing to watch. It's pretty typical in general, but there are a lot of those really short face paced shots of certain details. They may be annoying to the eye, but they are extremely effective, even when used so excessively.Compared to Shaun of the Dead the plot of Hot Fuzz is surprisingly clever. It deceives the viewer, so they focus on the certain character, who seems obviously guilty, and the viewer can't even think of the true nature of the crimes. The whole movie in general is slightly absurd, slightly extravagant, but it works! And the true murderer's identity... It's even more absurd, which is why it goes so well with the story in general! It makes the viewer go 'What the hell did just happen?' What the hell was just revealed? It's absolutely, astonishingly clever writing.Hot Fuzz is an amazing action comedy, one of the best there is, considering how unique the location for this kind of movie seems. It's hilarious and exhilarating! I feel like I shouldn't have expected anything else after Shaun of the Dead, but boy, you just can't expect this. Hot Fuzz truly deserves nine out of ten.",9,0,0,23 March 2016
Orphan," Intense, disturbing, but not a masterpiece.
","The story seems typical at first, but the twist gives this movie something original. Using a typical idea with a twist might be a good way to play it safe with the audience, though.The use of colours was excellent, but otherwise the cinematography was just decent. Also the music was pretty typical.Esther's character had a lot of potential, but it was wasted because in the end there was basically no mystery. Also in the end her motives etcetera felt kind of cheap.This was very thrilling, even though I knew the plot already. I think I just had a different point of view on things compared to when you watch this movie for the first time without knowing. Even though I knew almost everything there was to know, I felt really thrilled during the movie, I was on the edge of my seat.So in the end, typical story with original details. Very intense movie, very thrilling, but there's no way this would be my favourite movie from this genre. I feel like something is missing from the story, like a little spice. But definitely worth seeing.",7,0,0,12 June 2015
About Time," Brilliant and touching
","While I was at the rental store with my friend, we would've probably been there forever if she hadn't just decided on the fifth film for me. She chose About Time and promised me it was really good. I was sceptical, as I often am when someone else chooses a film for me to watch. And now that this movie is after, I know at least one friend whose taste I can trust.I liked the plot almost instantly. Usually I'm not fond of any love related plots, and by that I mean how the main character knew he wanted to find love. Still it was clear that wasn't the only thing he was searching for. Moving to London he wanted to find his place, his future, and that was something many of us can relate to. Finding love just happened along the way, tho it was a bit frustrating to watch. How dumb can you be, travelling back in time without realising then you never met the girl? And why did he keep trying to find her? Sure, they are great together, but still it seemed a bit bothersome. One of the nicest scenes in this movie - and there are a lot - was the one in the dark restaurant where neither the characters nor the audience can see. It was amazing to see how well Tim and Mary clicked, even though they didn't even see each other. Because of that the first sight of Mary was so special. These kind of romantic movies seem to have the same structure, so I kept waiting for something tremendously bad to happen, like some misunderstand which would lead to awful things that would eventually turn out to be good and all that. But About Time's structure is different. Time isn't simple, and the events in Tim's life are just that - they are life. They are normal things, and his life is relatively normal apart from the time travelling thing. It's really nice, and it's very beautiful. About Time is a very beautiful, funny and touching movie. It's amazing, and I'm really glad my friend chose it for me.",9,2,3,19 March 2017
500 Days of Summer," Good but Tom is frustrating
","I like the way this movie depicts guys who get obsessed with a girl and then like the image they had in their head instead of the girl. I like the way it's clear what happens was not Summer's fault - she was very clear about her intentions from the beginning. I like how we shouldn't feel bad for Tom because he is clearly an asshole. But I dislike the way this movie isn't as clear as it should be: people might see this movie and blame Summer for everything and not realise what it's like for women to meet a guy like Tom.This movie is good, but also seriously frustrating because of Tom. I love the music, it's amazing and has affected my own taste a lot.",5,1,1,8 January 2017
The Hateful Eight," A masterpiece - Tarantino never lets you down
","If there is one director who never lets you down, it's Tarantino. His newest film, The Hateful Eight is an excellent thriller with great story, cinematography and music - but who would expect any less? Right from the start The Hateful Eight captures the viewer, even though it has its slow pace.Tarantino is a very skillful writer. His characters are real, and not just some plain cardboard characters to fill out the blanks between the story. His dialogue is natural and amazing. The story of The Hateful Eight is simple when it's explained shortly, but it has many layers, just like most of his movies. And just like most of his movies, the events aren't in chronological order, but important pieces from before are revealed when needed. The thrill of the story is well built, and the violent action scenes are balanced with slow, calm scenes. I am glad to see Tarantino doesn't rely on mindless 3D technology to make a mediocre film look better. Many films that don't need 3D use it anyway. The Hateful Eight does look good though - it looks amazing. Every shot has whatever they need, the colours and details are astonishing. Tarantino's films always have the most amazing soundtracks. The soundtrack of The Hateful Eight has several amazing pieces that shouldn't work with the movie, but they do, and they do so beautifully. One this kind of track is Apple Blossom by The White Stripes. Also L'Ultima Diligenza Di Red Rock by Ennio Morricone - and all the variants played throughout the film - is haunting. It reminds of the beginning of The Shining, except this is way better. That track also seems out of place, because it would suit some classic yet indie horror movie because of the sinister vibes it gives. But it is perfect for this film.I think I loved every detail of this film. Of course there are slurs thrown around all the time, but it gives the certain effect to the characters: they are far from perfect. I don't think there was one character here that was completely good and pure. The Hateful Eight is a masterpiece. The rhythm is good, the film is balanced and it's violent in almost a funny way. This is definitely a film I will see in the cinemas again, because the big screen surely shows The Hateful Eight in its full potential.",10,23,51,13 January 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Wow they made the same movie, again?
","One of my biggest issues with these Marvel movies is the fact that if I want to keep up I have to watch every single thing they produce because everyone has cameos and every movie is connected to another. There are no stand-alone films anymore, and that can suck, if you're not into every superhero. I don't care for Captain America, so I haven't seen Civil War, where this new Spider-man, played by Tom Holland, made his first appearance. However, this film quickly recaps the important bits of Civil War, and by important bits I mean what Spider-Man did. Still there's a lot of stuff you need to remember from other Marvel movies. What's interesting in this new version is that there doesn't seem to be origin story the way Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man had origin stories. You could ask where the hell Peter Parker came from, but hey, I think we all know the thing with the radioactive spider and Uncle Ben getting shot, so we can safely assume that's still the case here. And of course there's an issue with Peter Parker as Spider-Man: aren't we all bored to death? What about Miles Morales, or any other Spider-Man? What about Gwen as Spider-Girl? The Amazing Spider-Man also took place in high school, but this time it actually feels like high school. Sure, Tom Holland is actually 21, but he's closer to a teenager than Andrew Garfield was, considering how fresh-faced Holland looks.Tom Holland is great as Peter Parker, as great as Garfield was, and definitely better than Tobey Maguire (though that we can all blame on bad writing). Spider-Man: Homecoming has amazing young actors, such as Jacob Batalon, Tony Revolori and Zendaya. But one of the biggest reasons I wanted to see this movie was Michael Keaton. He is great as a superhero (Batman) and as a villain (Vulture) and everything in-between. But apart from the fresh cast and new technology from the Avengers movies, Spider-Man: Homecoming isn't anything special. It's fun to watch, but not actually funny, apart from the typical Avengers humour. Plots in these are pretty much the same thing over and over, but then again, was anyone expecting anything else? Marvel is becoming a one trick pony. So if you love superheroes, then of course go see it, but if you want something new from Marvel, then this movie isn't for you I mean third version of Spider-Man? They have so many superheroes and they go with Spider-Man, again?",4,14,24,8 July 2017
Alien," I recognise a good movie even when I don't like it
","Once the film started, I felt like I had seen this before. There are so many space travel horror movies that follow the exact same pattern than Alien. Now I don't know if Alien is the first one of its kind, but it's definitely the best known. I actually saw Prometheus before any of the Alien films, and it's almost annoying how closely Prometheus followed the same pattern as this one. The writers of that movie should've come up with something slightly different, because if you've seen Alien, that makes Prometheus predictable - and the other way around. But it shouldn't be surprising every science fiction horror filmmaker wants to make a film like Alien. Alien's pace is just right - it's slow, but it doesn't feel too stretched. It's making everything even more intense than it'd be with faster pace. But with faster pace it would probably be harder and more annoying trying to keep a track of this movie. One really effective thing about this film is how gross everything looks. There's always some gross liquid coming out of somewhere. Otherwise the effects seem sometimes ridiculous, like the little baby alien running away. How can you take an intense, dramatic scene like that seriously when the effects are what they are?I don't enjoy this movie as much as other people can. I appreciate the horror elements and the value this film has, but I hate space travel science fiction. Simple setting is better, and of course the setting of Alien is simple - it's one ship, barely one planet and so on. Still I felt like I didn't completely understand what was going on.I appreciate this movie, and I recognise it's good, but I don't really like it, which affects the medium score I'm giving this film.",5,0,3,20 July 2016
Horrible Bosses," Average dark comedy, not necessarily worth seeing
","I didn't exactly know the plot when I started watching, I just knew the name and didn't make big assumptions based on it. The biggest reason for me to watch this movie is the incredibly talented cast. I'm especially fond of Charlie Day, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Darrel, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. The casting is great, everyone's character is exactly right for them, and especially when it comes to comedians and their style of acting in comedic roles.The plot is funny and it's actually so weird how thrilling this movie ended up being. But as to whether or not it's unpredictable... it's a comedy, so typically the writers have chosen always to go into the funniest way possible. Well, as funny as they can imagine. Sometimes it's predictable, sometimes it's not. What you can predict that in comedies everyone is very very dumb even when they are accidentally brilliant. Everything is going wrong until the last possible moment perhaps. So vis-Ã -vis the plot and the humour, Horrible Bosses is just pretty average typical dark comedy, apart from having somewhat atypical plot. And by somewhat atypical I mean it has definitely been done before, but it's not repeating some movie that already exists, and the same kind of thing isn't being done every year - apart from sequels. What bothered me the most was the annoying way the characters reacted to their friend (played by Charlie Day) being sexually assaulted by his female boss. 'Your situation isn't so bad', 'I can't really take you seriously right now', like are you f#@4ing kidding me? Apparently it's rare to see men writing comedy and not being really awfully sexist, like can people stop with the idea that men would enjoy being sexually assaulted / raped? So all in all, pretty average for its genre and humour. ... Wow that seems really dark after the last paragraph but that's how it is, I guess. Anyway yeah, obviously there are so many frustrating 'jokes' that make you think this movie was made decades ago instead of six years ago, but that's Hollywood for ya.",4,3,5,21 January 2017
Suicide Squad," Small good things, but as whole bad
","I saw this trailer when I went to see X-Men: Apocalypse and then again when I went to see Ghostbusters. The trailer made me very optimistic. Before the trailer I thought that this was not worth seeing. I know, I should've learnt by now that trailers are always better than the actual movie: the movie itself shattered all my hopes towards this movie. Writing in this movie is partially good. The idea of the script is good: let's give the bad guys a chance. Characters are deep, and it's easy to start liking them. They all have backstories, and some are explored. They give the characters something more than 'LOL we are just bad and crazy'. The only thing is I hate the Joker, but all the other characters were extremely interesting. But the writing is partially horrible. The dialogue seems kinda off. You see what's meant to be funny but it doesn't necessarily make you laugh. And it seems like this movie is trying to smooch off of Deadpool's success, considering he's an antihero, and he had that hilarious yet dark movie. If Suicide Squad wasn't trying to be like Deadpool meets Avengers except in DC universe, then their timing wasn't exactly the greatest.But I don't want to start saying which one is better DC or Marvel. Both are good yet both suck. I'm just saying, the timing was bad.When I watch a movie like this, I have high hopes for the action scenes, especially when technology is getting better and all that. In Suicide Squad, the action scenes are poorly executed. They are messy and it's hard to see what is going on and who is who. I mistook Boomerang for Rick Flag at one point and the dialogue was very confusing. Action scenes are allowed to be messy if they look interesting. These scenes were just shooting, and that's not exactly interesting to watch.I loved most of the actors chosen for this movie. I love Will Smith, I love Margot Robbie, Karen Fukuhara, Jay Hernandez and Viola Davis (and of course Affleck, even if his role is small in Suicide Squad). Now I don't exactly like Cara Delevingne's acting skills, but still there's something much worse in the cast: Jared Leto. I've seen him in two movies before this, so I haven't seen that much acting from him but he is definitely not the right choice for Joker. He's just a disastrously bad copy of Heath Ledger. But the cast is amazingly diverse. Visually this movie is amazing. It's very dark, like David Fincher's movies. That's effective, though sometimes you don't even see who is in the scene. The bright neon colours give a nice touch to the movie.The best part of Suicide Squad is the soundtrack. Few of my favourites include Heathens by Twenty One Pilots, Fortunate Son by CCR, Bohemian Rhapsody, Spirit in the Sky, Seven Nation Army. I can't stand Eminem, but Without Me by him suited this film very well. All are amazing, but still, Bohemian Rhapsody was used better in the trailer - it's really hard to put in an actual scene, no matter how awesome that song is.Suicide Squad has many amazing details, but as a whole it isn't great. The idea is good, but eventually the story is boring. It seems like the film is just destroying stuff, explosions and shooting and smooching off of amazing characters. The characters deserve better movies. I heard there might be a spin-off for Harley Quinn, that's amazing. But I want to see the others in their own movies as well, like Katana and Deadshot.",4,3,5,20 August 2016
Elf," Decent film for its genre and intended audience
","I've seen a lot about Elf, but I hadn't ever seen it before. I actually was expecting something slightly different from Elf. I haven't seen Will Ferrell, so I had some weird expectations. For some reason I thought Elf would be intended for adult audiences. Now, well, it's not simply for kids, but it is a film for the whole family, which means it has a lot of themes kids appreciate more than adults. By that I mean such typical holiday spirit that grows towards the end - and how adults in the film aren't interested in Xmas or their children and blah blah. Sure, that is unfortunately true, but it has been used so many times in films it's becoming boring.Sure, Elf had some originality. The idea of an elf adjusting to human life is silly but interesting. Of course the theme of that idea has been explored over and over again, but adding the Xmas feeling to it makes it different from the typical theme. The story goes on the same way every single comedy film seems to go. It is funny until the end where it's almost sad because something goes so badly wrong, but in the end everything is alright again! I saw that pattern even before I was half-way through the film. But then again, it's a Xmas comedy film for the whole family. How could that be original? So when thinking of that, Elf was an alright film.",5,1,2,25 December 2015
Corpse Bride," Good Halloween film, nothing else
","Corpse Bride is one of those almost classic movies you should watch on Halloween considering you're not too into horror movies. That's kind of the specialty of Tim Burton: he makes dark movies emo or goth teens are way too invested in. I don't know if it has to do with the plots or the aesthetic.But the aesthetic of Corpse Bride is amazing: almost colourless land of the living, the colourful and fun land of the dead. The characters look amazing, everyone looks different and has different shapes of their faces and body. It's a nice change from typical animations, but of course the main characters are tall and skinny with the typical Burton styled faces: pale skin, huge eyes with dark circles around them. Still, every little detail in the animation is amazing. I could talk about stop-motion animation all day long, but perhaps not.Danny Elfman's music is pretty but generic. It's been heard over and over again. Sure, Victor's Piano Solo may give the viewer goose bumps, but other than that, every song feels like it's been done so many times before. The soundtrack is alright, but could be way better.The story is interesting and well-written. It's short, and many things are left unexplained, but it's better that way. It's good that it ends quite suddenly without anything like 'FEW WEEKS LATER' because that would kind of ruin the moment. The movie is about what it is about, it doesn't need anything else. The structure of the story is very similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas. No, it's not entirely the same, it's not 'copied', but it has some sort of parallels and symmetry.Corpse Bride is a good movie to watch around Halloween, but that's about it. I can't imagine watching it during the summer or anything. Corpse Bride has charisma, unique aesthetic and astonishing setting.",4,1,3,30 October 2015
Ant-Man," More relaxed than others, very entertaining
","Ant-Man? Marvel isn't making movies about the actually interesting heroes, but we get a movie about Ant-Man? I was very suspicious when Ant-Man was announced. Who actually gave a chicken-s@#t about Ant-Man? However my mind changed once I learned Edgar Wright was one of the writers. I've liked his style so, you know, even if Ant-Man had been total rubbish, at least there was some skillful writing - not just from Wright.The most distinct thing about Ant-Man is how much simpler it is compared to the massive Avengers franchise. The story is simple, mostly revolving around a heist instead of some huge, epic fight that will cause millions of dollars worth of damage to the cities. It's simple, yet still interesting enough to watch. Another special thing about Ant-Man is how much more relaxed it seems. There's no giant need to make it super serious and stuff a lot of philosophical pondering in there, which usually does go to total waste when it comes to superhero movies. Ant-Man is an action comedy, and it usually manages to make even the most important fights quite funny in rather easy ways. Ant-Man does a way better job at making the situation lighter than, say, Avengers: Age of Ultron, where they just zing kind of cheesy one-liners here and there to get cheap laughs from the audience. Could it be because writers of Avengers are working under this huge pressure and they can't really enjoy themselves, while reaction to Ant-Man being announced was pretty much 'Why the f@#k would you make this movie?'Of course there are annoyances, which are too common with any superhero movies, and they get recycled over and over again. There's that unnecessary romance, predictable structure, but what's most annoying to me is you can't really watch a Marvel movie unless you've seen like at least three others. I'd love to be able to watch Ant-Man as Ant-Man, because it's actually funny movie, but there's hint to movies I haven't seen, and I don't want to watch. This is the biggest problem with the franchise system - you can't just watch movies individually. Like sure I wouldn't watch Iron Man 3 without seeing the first two, but like this is the first Ant-Man movie and still I have to know so much? It's a buzzkill.All in all Ant-Man is a very entertaining movie, but it has the same flaws every superhero movie has. Thankfully though it's hilarious and way more relaxed than any other superhero movie I've seen - apart from Deadpool, of course.",8,0,0,27 May 2017
21 Jump Street," So much better than I expected
","To be fair I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. 21 Jump Street is hilarious. Of course many of the jokes are typical and disgusting and annoying, but a lot of times the jokes and the absurdity of the situation just becomes absolutely hilarious. A good example is when they have to take the drug in front of the guy selling them, and then the rest of their day goes so wrong in ridiculous way. Probably the best joke is when Deputy Chief Hardy says 'We're reviving a canceled undercover police program from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle stuff from the past and expect us all not to notice.' Great irony!I haven't actually seen the original show, but from what I know there's no point in comparing them like which one is better, since the stories are different and all that. But 21 Jump Street is absolutely hilarious, and just so much better than what I expected.",8,0,0,3 May 2016
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," I was expecting more
","When I started watching it I was hoping for something hilarious yet something that I could write more than few sentences about. Well, it wasn't that funny and it wasn't that smart either. The cleverest thing was how the main character Conner is exactly what we think certain kind of celebrities are like.I mostly wanted to watch this movie because I like The Lonely Island's music, and also Will Arnett was in it. Arnett's part was small, but I expected that. But there wasn't as much music as I would've hoped for. How many songs were fully played? Maybe four. Mockumentary as a style of story telling is getting a little boring, but how else would they have done this though?Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping was an okay movie. It was funny and all, but also very annoying, and I don't think I'll be watching it again.",4,8,18,22 October 2016
Hot Rod," Pretty funny, but hardly worth a second watch
","The only thing I knew about this movie when I rented it was that it has incredible cast. That was the main reason I chose to watch it. It wasn't until later that I realised Akiva Schaffer directed the movie (I read about that like three minutes ago when I actually googled this movie and prepared to write this review). This movie has amazingly funny dialogue and writing, but also the typical physical stunts, or how the main character fails at them. Hilarious conversation and the bumbling around both work, and there are memorable scenes from both types. Good example of the humorous dialogue is this quote: 'You look pretty.' 'What?' 'I said you look shitty!'Hot Rod's structure is typical to almost every comedy or drama that was ever made. But still as Rod is about to do this big stunt, it can go horribly wrong or amazingly well. That's the thing about comedies, they are unpredictable in a way. Only certain thing is that whether it goes wrong or right, it will be hilarious. I like the 80s aesthetic, but I'm still not entirely sure when the story actually takes place. There are other things I'm not sure about - like how old were the main characters? The way they acted and the stuff they said made it seem like they were teens or maybe early 20's. Of course it's even harder because of teenagers are mostly played by 20-somethings instead of actual teens. And the age thing didn't really bother me until Jonathan, who was played by Will Arnett (6' 2Â½''), showed up. The character is taller than everyone else and considering he had a real job and all seemed way older than everyone else. That made me think that maybe the main characters weren't as young as I thought, just a little immature.Hot Rod is a pretty typical comedy. It makes you laugh, so it does its job well, but I don't think I'll be re-watching this any time soon.",5,1,2,17 November 2016
28 Weeks Later," An amazing sequel, even if it's not necessary
","Did 28 Days Later need a sequel? Probably not, but I'm still glad we got one.The story in 28 Weeks Later is happening in significantly smaller area. In 28 Days Later the main characters travel a lot while in this one the characters mostly stay in London, and especially that small, secured area in London. The more confined milieu gives the story something more, since the virus and the infected aren't really a thread somewhere outside, but it's inside, among you. And it creates even more chaos when the US soldiers are trying to control the situation. It's brilliant and agonising.While all of the movie is very good, one of the most effective moments is at the beginning of the film, when Don (Robert Carlyle) runs when the infected attack his wife. Another friend of mine had seen the movie and described it to me when we were younger, when I was about 11 or 12. And I still remember the way she described it and how impressive, maybe even awesome that scene was. You're used to seeing people being heroes in movies, and that was the opposite. Even if we may not really experience Don's fear in that scene, his actions are incredibly powerful. Also the shaky camera, quick and fast shots at the beginning were a bit worrisome. I was afraid that's what most of the movie was going to be like, because it just kept going on and on. It's effective, but also makes everything really hard to follow. Yet you could see the most important things. The only thing I like less about this movie is how American it seems. Of course it takes place in UK, and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is a Spanish director, so it's not the movie itself. It's mostly how the US army is involved in securing London, letting people back in London. It's annoying, but also it seems really typical. It's annoying because you know that's exactly how it would go.28 Days Later doesn't necessarily need a sequel. 28 Weeks Later is different, and a certain touch is missing with Danny Boyle, but Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has made something haunting and amazing. You don't need to see it, since the story is different, but it's still absolutely worth your time.",9,1,3,23 March 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," These are getting worse
","The ending is closer and the movies are worse. Still they are trying to make an action film out of Harry Potter, but what's worse is how the filmmakers clearly don't know what to cut. There is such a long time of... nothing. They do nothing. There's some dialogue but it's not always entirely insightful. And there's the weird dance scene and all that. Yes, those scenes how Harry, Ron and Hermione were on the run for a really long time, but that's really frustrating for the audience. How about you cut that and make this film shorter - or better yet - include some things that were in the books but were barely mentioned in the movie.I also don't like the point where they cut the movie in two. I've checked so many times what is the half point of the book, and I think they should've cut the movie around there - where that chapter ends at least. But I guess they wanted to stuff the Deathly Hallows into this movie. Best part of the whole movie is the Tale of the three brothers. It's visually more stunning than anything we've seen in Harry Potter movies. It's so awesome it seems completely out of place in this movie. It's still of course an interesting piece of lore, and a nice way to take a break from the events in the movie. Everything went downhill after Prisoner of Azkaban. I've been wondering why I don't like Harry Potter so much anymore, but this seems to be the reason. None of the later movies were good.",3,3,4,23 October 2016
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Exceeds the two previous movies
","CuarÃ³n was a way better choice compared to Columbus! Columbus' versions were clearly meant more for kids than (young) adults, but CuarÃ³n knows how to make a film truly for the whole family. Prisoner of Azkaban is of course scary for kids, but not too terrifying, yet still thrilling for anyone older. Visually Prisoner of Azkaban exceeds two previous movies. It's a lot different, considering how simple the first movies tried to be. There cinematography is astonishing and the camera moves in fun ways - like through windows or mirrors, and that always fascinated me as a kid. Even if movies are meant for children, cinematographers shouldn't shy away from eccentric, artistic choices because kids will love them. Also Prisoner of Azkaban rocks as an adaptation. It has scenes that didn't exist in the book and many details added by those who made this film, yet they all work. Those conversations between Harry and Lupin were always amazing and even if they weren't in the book or they were in the book but in a different form, those conversations were amazing and deep and gave... some hope to it. Also this is the only movie that has Harry's messy hair right.Prisoner of Azkaban really stands out from all the other Harry Potter movies. It's no wonder many claim it to be their favourite.",8,1,4,16 October 2016
The Lego Movie," Funniest animation I have seen in a while
","The world in this movie is amazing. It feels limitless and imaginative - which exactly has always been the strength of the Legos. I love how they didn't just make a dumb funny movie, but actually captivated the power the toys have always had. Another amazing thing about the world is how it plays with many levels of reality. Of course there are the many different worlds in the Lego worlds, but that isn't all, as you can guess by the 'Man from upstairs'. The plot is good. It is of course simple, but what do you expect from a movie that suits for the whole family.The humour is amazing - it has many different types of humour, since it's meant for people of all ages to enjoy. And the animation! I loved it, it looks so much fun compared to the typical Disney Pixar -type of animation. Definitely a good movie. It should have won the Academy Award for best animation, simply because it's so much fun and it feels like there are so many different philosophical themes one could talk of.",9,0,1,11 September 2015
Now You See Me," One big magic trick!
","I've wanted to see Now You See Me since I saw a GIF-set from the beginning of the movie. In the scene Jesse Eisenberg's character does a magic trick with a cards, and even through few GIFs the trick works, and that blew my mind. Another reason was that I saw the trailer for the sequel, and I wanted to see that, but didn't catch it at the theatre.The cast of Now You See Me is excellent, and that's the first thing I noticed even before seeing the movie. All the actors and actresses are well known, and while they quickly feel like a weird combination, they all work well together. For example it's always a joy to see Woody Harrelson in a movie - if the movie is good, that is, because I've had enough disappointments with movies he was in.While the cast is amazing, the characters are even more awesome, and every actor does their job wonderfully and with skill. In the beginning you very quickly learn the basics about the four magicians, but towards the end they don't have so many lines and it's mostly about the FBI and the Interpol trying to catch them, but during that short while you are introduced to four interesting characters, and while I think there's much more to know about them, I am content with what this film offered me. While it's easier to root for the magicians, Mark Ruffalo and MÃ©lanie Laurent's characters also turn out to be more than two-dimensional Lawful Good characters what we are used to in a crime mystery movies where the criminals seem to be more like heroes. The plot of his movie is sensational and clever. It sweeps you off your feet right in the beginning: you see characters and you want to know what that mysterious party wants with them. And as the movie goes on the plot just keeps getting bigger and bigger, larger than you'd think. The film is full of delicious plot twist, and each and every one of those work instead of just being there to confuse the audience. Now You See Me is like a magic trick, with misdirection and all.But this film was so great and well written I'm pretty skeptical about the sequel. How could it be as good, because how could they introduce just as amazing plot twists? Also it never feels good when a director changes between two movies.I'm not familiar with Jon M. Chu, but comparing his filmography with Louis Leterrier's makes me a tiny bit suspicious. But still, I wouldn't want to miss out on Now You See Me 2.",9,0,1,30 June 2016
The Usual Suspects," Great thriller
","The Usual Suspects is a movie I've been meaning to watch since forever. My dad actually owns the DVD, but sometimes you have to rent a movie to actually see it - because you've paid for it and it would suck if you'd basically lose money and not see it.I didn't know much about The Usual Suspects. Story-wise I only knew that picture of the line up. I had avoided the spoilers almost perfectly. Just almost? I did know about the twist. I didn't know what it was, I just knew there was going to be a huge twist. Also I had seen that one Saturday Night Live sketch, which kind of gives something away. Even though I kind of knew something about the ending, I didn't know the story, and I didn't know how to get to the ending and what the ending would actually mean in the story, because a SNL sketch doesn't exactly explain the referenceIt's hard to get in the right mood with the movie. There's no hook before the opening credits, you just have to wait until they are over or maybe fast forward through them. They offer nothing except John Ottman's music, which is of course decent, but not any different from typical movie music. But when the movie begun, it just begun. It was a bit fast, unclear. What is happening, who are these people, oh now we're at now... When they start questioning Verbal it becomes clearer. Still flashbacks are a hard way to tell the story - they are very quick and the audience can feel like something was left out, except I think this is exactly what McQuarrie might've been after. But once you get used to the pace and the style of story telling, the movie turns into a very exciting thriller. I guess the only problem in watching this movie over 20 years later is that it's now easier to guess the big twist. It might be because of a certain actor, it might be because this kind of twist is now more common, or it's just the evolution of cinema. But at one point while watching this movie it all clicked together. Of course the SNL sketch helped, and so did that one scene from the first Scary Movie - which is something I haven't seen in ages but it just came to me and I realised that's where it's from!But figuring out a twist isn't exactly bad, you can also feel super victorious.All in all, The Usual Suspects is a good thriller, a bit slow but the end makes it so much better. It has definitely aged well. But after seeing it once I don't feel like watching it again any time soon. It might be like some other movies with major twist: once you know it, you can watch it maybe once more to like see it from the new perspective, but that's it.",8,1,1,5 February 2017
28 Days Later...," Excellent!
","I like zombie movies, I just don't watch them as much. My current favourite is Shaun of the Dead, which isn't exactly that serious. 28 Days Later is probably the first more serious zombie movie I really like. Of course the problem is most of these movies have a similar structure to them. It's always about survival, having to kill someone you care, all that. Comedies of course take different kind of turns.Plot structure to 28 Days Later seems pretty similar to the other movies I've seen or heard about. There are still some twists I really enjoy, and very many scenes I like. But the main reason this movie stands out is because of the characters. I usually am not extremely fond of characters in horror, because you never know what's going to happen. But then I realised how attached I was to the characters of this movie. That realisation happened during some of the most serene and so very nice scenes, like the one at the grocery store. Those little scenes are so nice and heart-warming it makes everything else even more painful. You just want them to have nice, good lives, but horror movies are what they are.The cinematography is interesting. It's annoying at first, because it's grainy and really poor, but it keeps getting better. Also I really like the music in this film. It's simple, it amplifies the feeling in each scene, and it isn't just scary music used to make the scenes seem more threatening. It's a perfect soundtrack when you don't want to take any risks.All in all 28 Days Later is a great genre movie. Danny Boyle sure knows how to direct all kind of stuff, huh?",9,0,3,18 March 2017
Django Unchained," Yet another amazing film about revenge
","The story of Django Unchained is interesting and very thrilling. Okay, that's hard to sincerely while that screenplay picture is there, but I really do mean it. Django's character makes everything even better. He is definitely a hero, but he's slightly complicated hero. Usually roles like that are made for white actors, but there's no way to make this story about a white man. There are too few heroes that aren't just white men, especially when we're talking about roles where the hero is forced to act against his beliefs. Meaning Django had to pretend to be a black slaver, and he did his part and seemed almost merciless, and even when you know that's just for his plans, it is awful to watch. The love angle is a good add for this story. Of course the revenge theme is very strong here, but the love story of Django and his wife Broomhilda is definitely a nice touch. Maybe the audience doesn't get to see romance that much, but it gives a sort of softer feeling to this.Violence in Django Unchained has two reasons: there's the violence that the slaves face. And that's something that definitely shouldn't be left out. Slaves were treated horribly and that's a fact, and seeing that violence on screen makes it harder for people to not talk about it. And then there's the violence where Django gets his revenge, and those are amazing. Firstly there's the catharsis - the bad guys get what they deserve. Secondly, film is a fantasy. One guy fighting ten or more guys and surviving is impossible, and we all know that, but it is thrilling to watch.It's impossible to talk about Tarantino's films without mentioning the music. Once again, I loved the soundtrack of Django Unchained. It felt different compared to the other movies I've seen, but it was still good.Django Unchained is definitely amazing movie. It deals with a very serious issue, yet it manages to give a satisfying result to everything.",10,2,5,23 January 2016
Get Out," Best horror movie I've seen
","Usually when a movie is very hyped there's a chance it disappoints you, but that's not the case with Get Out. Everyone's been talking about how brilliant Jordan Peele is, and I have to agree.The very first thing I have to say is I can't believe Get Out is Jordan Peele's directorial debut. The film show such profound understanding of cinema, that many directors don't grasp even though they've done more films than Peele. Also Peele's done some very thorough work. I saw this movie last night and I'm only know writing this review, but during this time I've procrastinated I've re- realised so many moments and details of this movie. They weren't details that made no sense, they were details that either seemed like just an addition to the story or just the kind of stuff you usually have in this genre. The movie itself was completely amazing, but the more I keep thinking about this, the more I'm convinced Jordan Peele is a god damn genius.All the ingredients of an amazing film are here. The pacing is amazing, so is the build up. The story is detailed, characters carefully planned and multi-dimensional. The soundtrack is incredible and haunting, and it definitely helps to keep you on the edge of your seat. Get Out also has everything you need from the horror genre. The way the story and the horror progress is amazing and close to perfection. It's just unnerving, then turns into something really disturbing, then turns into absolutely terrifying. All the good elements are there: psychological horror, mind control (or hypnotism) and blood. Also they have manage to keep the audience absolutely excited during the whole thing. Some of the white audience have been angry at the racism aspect though. But it shouldn't be hard to understand why the white people in this movie are so terrifying. Get Out is absolutely brilliant movie, and without a doubt the best horror movie I've ever seen.",10,10,26,12 May 2017
22 Jump Street," I thought this one would be just repeating but...
","... I was wrong, in a way. Of course 22 Jump Street has a similar structure to the previous film, but still 22 Jump Street manages to be original and not just repeating the first one. While the situations and some characters are familiar, 22 Jump Street is still enjoyable and worth seeing. That's a lot more than I would've expected.22 Jump street is still as hilarious as the first film. This time a good example of the quality humour in this film was the good trip / bad trip when Schmidt and Jenko are on drugs. I also thought that I had seen the funniest bit - how the relationship between Schmidt and Maya became extremely awkward. But even if I knew how that was going to go, it still was so ridiculous and hilarious, oh my god. 22 Jump Street also had amazing fourth wall breaks, mostly about the budget. Same could go with how much older Schmidt and Jenko look compared to the other students. It's like when you're watching a TV show and all the high schoolers are played by fully grown people.This film is hilarious and so much fun. I thought I'd rate it lower than the first one, but I guess I was wrong about this one - just like the first one. But still, if I'd have to choose one, I'd go with the first one. Something about it just makes it so much more interesting. It's not necessarily funnier or more thrilling, but it's like the first time you see a film and it's so much better than the second time. I guess that applies to this case as well.",8,1,3,3 May 2016
Moulin Rouge!," Beyond amazing!
","Moulin Rouge! was on TV last night, and since I hadn't seen it in ages I decided to watch it. The story of Moulin Rouge! is quite simple when you think about it. But it's not just the story, there are of course other elements, like the bohemian revolution, and the characters' quest to have truth, beauty freedom and love in their play. And while the love story is simple, combined with everything else that's happening in the movie makes Moulin Rouge! quite unique, and clearly it stands out from the romance genre. While the story is of course tragic, Luhrmann and Pearce didn't make it just tragic. Moulin Rouge! is beautiful, lovely, tragic and hilarious. Moulin Rouge! is actually pretty wild, The shots and special effects alone make it so, but also the humour is amazing. There's a lot of misunderstandings and second-hand embarrassment, and so many other ways it's amazing. Especially the beginning of the movie is extremely wild, and it brings out the contrast between the tragedy of the movie.One of the strengths in Moulin Rouge! is the visual side of the film. It's extremely colourful and very detailed. Many of the set designs are extremely detailed - in fact they are so detailed, there's no point even trying to see every detail in certain rooms etcetera. Also a lot of scenes consist of extremely fast and short shots. That's usually fine by me, it creates a nice effect, but in some parts they are used way too much. Sometimes it hard to concentrate and focus because the shots don't necessarily flow so nicely. But still, that is just one thing, because otherwise the cinematography in this film is almost perfect.The music is beyond amazing! I have the soundtrack and I love each and every song on that soundtrack. They take songs from our time and put them in 1899, that's just amazing. My absolute favourite is El Tango De Roxanne, because they way the song Roxanne is turned into something completely knew is so effective, almost surprising every time I watch this movie. Also the choreography and the visual side of the scene during El Tango De Roxanne is just amazing. Apart from that I can not say which song is my favourite, because every song is so amazing. Sparkling Diamonds, Elephant Love Medley, Come What May, Someday I'll Fly Away... All those are magnificent!When you don't watch Moulin Rouge! for along time, you might forget about its charm. Maybe it's also because now I'm older, but Moulin Rouge! is probably one of my favourite musicals. Every part of this movie works.",9,0,3,9 April 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men: Apocalypse > All Avengers movies
","X-Men: Apocalypse was what I hoped it to be! While I haven't read what the (professional) critics have written about the film (and to be fair, I don't care) opinions and reviews from the fans have been extremely positive. There's been a lot of implying that Jean Grey's scene at the end is better than the whole Avengers franchise, or that Logan's cameo is better than the whole Avengers franchise. I can't help but agree!X-Men: Apocalypse is taken to some pretty epic levels, yet it seems effortless. The X-Men franchise is full of amazing, intriguing stories, and I don't think the writers have to dig too deep to find a story hey can make as epic as Apocalypse. Think about Days Of Future Past. X- Men manages to make these kind of stories while Avengers franchise seems to be slowly building to some kind of really epic movie, and that process is infuriatingly slow. Pick up the pace, Marvel!The writing is as good as it tends to be in superhero movies. There are few moments where the thrill is built up so well it takes your breath away. For example, when Scott Summers' abilities activate. You know exactly what's going to happen but you really feel how intense the scene is. It's just fabulous. The plot itself is decent. The greatest thing is the villain, because he seems impossible to beat, which gives it even more thrill. Of course typical plot devices are used, like the antagonist team gets one from the good side and is about to use him in their diabolical plot, just like in X2, but even though that is extremely familiar trope to those who have been following X-Men since the beginning, all of us worry so much for the character - unless you are heartless and don't understand why hurting him or using him is horrible.Is there something I don't like about this movie? The dialogue was sometimes extremely clumsy, especially when Charles Xavier first mentioned Moira. That kind of clumsy 'schoolboy with a crush' dialogue would not suit sir Patrick Stewart, which makes it sound a little tacky. Also bringing back Moira was amazing, but it seems like the writers tried to make it seem like 'yup, professor X is straight and nothing's going on between him and Erik'. Whoops. that didn't work: their chemistry is too good. But I have to say my biggest annoyance in the film is this: there are a few characters that I thought seemed cool: they are new, and they have a lot of potential. But nope, they were killed to make another character develop again. I don't think creating new characters only to kill them is a good way to go. Even I can think of other ways. What if he had lived alone, humans realised who he was the same way, and tried to capture him, being more brutal, so he'd see that oh yeah, humans are still that bad. I just didn't see the need to introduce us to new characters and have them killed five minutes later.Usually it's annoying when X-Men franchise brings in new mutants and it's hard to keep a track of them. That has happened in, like, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and in the future of Days Of Future Past. Apocalypse gives us new mutants, except they aren't new. Scott Summers is back, so is Jean Grey, Kurt Wagner, Angel and Storm. Now we haven't seen all the new characters in movies before, but they are still familiar from comics, like Jubilee and Psylocke. Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner Kodi Smit-McPhee and Alexandra Shipp are phenomenal in their roles, some of them are better than the original adult actors, and I look forward seeing them in the possible next X- Men movies. Most of the old actors and actresses are just as good as they've always been. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender can't really compete with Stewart and McKellen, but they are extremely talented and good choices. Evan Peters makes this movie so much more delightful as Quicksilver. Avengers couldn't compete with their Quicksilver, Evan Peters is charming and so is his character. Oscar Isaac was fearsome and amazing as En Sabah Nur, but he has the problem many people in CGI filled superhero movies have: their face is covered up with all that technology. I like seeing the faces of actors and actresses, that tells a lot about their skills, but CGI is slowly killing this.True, I don't really like CGI much anyway, but I think this film is 80 % CGI. They couldn't do most of that stuff without it, so I don't think I can complain.X-Men: Apocalypse pulled me back to the fiery pits of X-Men hell. This movie has everything I love about X-Men movies, apart from ethical questions. In X-Men Apocalypse you can't choose sides, because who would be on the side of a guy who wants to destroy the world? The X- Men movies tend to have several categories for villains, but at least this time the villain wasn't a human being who hated mutants, like Stryker in X2 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Apocalypse is closer to Sebastian Shaw: a mutant whose goal seems to be to genocide but let the strong individuals live. X-Men: Apocalypse is intense in the perfect way, epic because of the story and the villain, and simply amazing. While there were less than perfect moments worth a good eye-rolling, as a whole this movie was astonishing. This film is the reason why I will always prefer X- Men over any other superhero franchise.",9,9,19,22 May 2016
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I hate this
","Twilight movies are painful to watch. Not because of the dramatic and heart-breaking love stories, but because everyone is expressionless. Everyone always complains about Kristen Stewart, but everyone is just as bad as she is - except none of these actors are bad. I've seen Kristen Stewart in other movies, and she's an excellent actress. Same goes for almost everyone, yet everyone is so horrible in these movies. What also makes these movies painful is how everything is stupidly cheesy and dramatic, and every scene is unnecessary long. You could've easily made this an 1,5 hour film instead of two hours - just cut every useless part out. Thank you.The story is annoying. Edward breaks up with Bella to protect her and she gets depressed. But her depression is so severe I honestly cannot believe that is a result of a healthy relationship ending. If you delete the supernatural element and change the beginning, it honestly feels like Bella just got out of an abusive relationship and is therefore a little broken and all that. Yeah, Bella is not an extremely three-dimensional character, but I almost want to protect her from Edward. I hate Edward Cullen. Sure, there aren't many likable characters in these movie, but Edward is the worst. He's manipulative and controlling. It's like you start dating someone, but after a while you realise they tell you what to do and you don't dare to defy them. That's the kind of character Edward is. Special effects are so stupid. Nothing looks real. All vampires' eyes are so fake, like no one in real life could look a Cullen in the eyes and be like 'yep, those are very normal eyes'. The wolves were even faker. They looked like they came from a children's animation, and while that's understandable, they looked so incredibly unrealistic it ruined every scene with the wolves in it. One thing makes this movie better than the first one: there is less of Edward and more of Jacob. Or is that two things? I still dislike them both, but before we know what Jacob is he's so lovely. Everyone else is just so grim and blah.",3,0,0,3 October 2016
The Evil Dead," Deserves its reputation, but I was waiting for more
","Watching The Evil Dead in 2010s is kind of weird. It feels like one hell of a trope fest, but you can't help but think, how many of these tropes did this movie start? How can I judge that when I don't know, and it's for a review on a blog and I'm too lazy to do some research? And it's better to not actually address all that, because then I'd have to talk again about how stupid the characters are, because everyone's always a total idiot in horror movies. If I had to address that every time I watched horror movies, I'd probably never watch another horror movie again.While the story is great, and this is an excellent things there are few things that bother me. One of them is the cinematography. It's sometimes so weird and bad it ruins the mood. And sometimes it feels like the movie is a bad home video made by my dad. That is an eccentric look and it could be either good or bar. In this movie that look did work, but then most of the cinematography was just weird.Another thing was the effects, but hey, it's the 1980s, so it's not like I was expecting something hyper realistic. And I think it's better this way. All that crappy make up and stuff makes everything even more horrifying. You can't really get that same feeling with CGI.While I notice and can acknowledge why The Evil Dead has that reputation as cult classic, and I see why it was a big deal when it came out, it kinda leaves me cold. Could be the fact that it's kind of short, and I'm hoping to see more of Ash. There's something really charming about Bruce Campbell as Ash, and I don't know what it is yet. But even if I'm not a big fan of the Evil Dead, I'm definitely going to see the second movie, and also The Army of Darkness.",9,0,1,30 March 2017
From Dusk Till Dawn," Messed up, but fun!
","First thing you need to know before watching From Dusk Till Dawn is that it is a B movie. It is made that way. It's one of those movies that need to be crappy in a certain way. All the vampires look really shitty. It just makes them gross, which is all part of the fun.While the TV show tells the audience a lot more about the whole thing and several people stay alive, the film also shares some of the strengths of the show. One of them how thrilling few scenes are, and you are not sure who to root for. To be honest, in the TV show there were more parties to root for than in the film, but still, same feeling.The cast of this film is really weird in a way. Clooney and Tarantino playing brothers? How would that ever be believable? Well, it seems alright, because the two work really well together. From Dusk Till Dawn is really messed up, but it is also so much fun, as Rodriguez' movies usually are. Excellent film, definitely has earned its cult status.",7,2,5,5 January 2016
Logan," Maybe not what I wanted but definitely the ending I needed
","I've been waiting for this movie for so long, but also I've been really nervous. The movie hasn't been hiding what it is: the last one about Logan, or at least the last one with Hugh Jackman as Logan, and let's be honest... It's not like they're going to cast a new actor to play Wolverine any time soon, eh? He's been in every single one of the X- men movies for 17 years. Hugh Jackman is iconic in this role, so why would they be in a hurry to replace him? Especially when now's the chance to make movies without him and maybe focus on some of the other characters.But personally, am I sick of seeing Wolverine in every X-men movie? No. Another thing that made a bit worried was how I had realised I'm not at all into dark superhero movies, at least not the ones I had seen before Logan. They were a bit boring and miserable, trying to be all gritty and edgy. But when wasn't Logan an gritty, miserable, edgy character? And at the beginning this movie was exactly what I feared it might be - gritty, miserable, dark world with no happiness in it for Logan. Luckily that changed. It changed slowly, but the world did change into something a tiny bit happier, tiny bit more hopeful. Also at the beginning something felt so wrong to me, and soon enough I was able to place that feeling. It was Charles. I understand he had some kind of disease affecting his brain, so naturally that would also affect his personality, but at first he just didn't feel like Charles, and Charles has always been a very, very important part of the X-men universe. He's that one good spark of hope even in the middle of the worst moments. So when he's clearly not well, it's just awful to look at, to listen to. Clearly that was the intention for the writers, though. It was just really rough to see Charles that way.Visually this movie was so beautiful, the cinematography was amazing. Also the composer, Marco Beltrami, did an amazing job. I like how the score sounds just a bit like the one in Wolverine (2013), but not too much, not like they were trying to do that same score again.X-men movies have always been barely violent so they can be PG-13, but finally we get a Wolverine movie that is just as violent as it needs to be. Usually Wolverine stabs and slices and there's barely any blood. Ever since I played X-Men Origins: Wolverine video game I've been waiting for that kind of movie. And now we have it! And it's not just like full on violent content without anything else. The fight scenes are beautifully coordinated, and of course there's so much more to the story than just Wolverine and Laura fighting folks.The story just is so beautiful I can't get over it. And while the movie wasn't perfect, and I didn't like everything about it, at the end of the day I don't know what else I would've needed. This is the perfect even if sad ending for wonderful 17 years Hugh Jackman has been our Wolverine.",8,0,4,6 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed
","Joss Whedon's writing is decent, but if something bothers me, it's the cheap jokes. They are used constantly, and they just are so cheesy and almost forced. Most of the audience loved them though, so maybe that works to some kind of audience.The structure of the plot was very similar to the first Avengers, though that isn't a surprise. I don't think anyone is expecting a complicated, mind-blowing plot. The story is simple, it's decent. The fight scenes seemed much clearer this time, it was a lot easier to see what was happening and where, and who was involved. I don't know if it was just due to cinematography or effects, or the fact that I was watching a 2D version.I was kind of hoping more from Ultron. I wanted a character who was actually scary, a villain you couldn't defend. Well, you probably can't really defend Ultron, except for the obvious â him being a robot. But he still seemed too likable. He was kind of too humane, almost funny. James Spader was wonderful though, and his voice alone was enough to make Ultron scary when needed.The movie had its funny moments, exciting moments, pseudo-deep moments, and the weirdly surprising moments. But why did they need to add romance? It seemed sort of forced.In short, Avengers Age of Ultron is decent, so don't get your expectations high. But it is worth seeing, otherwise it's hard to keep up with the world in these movies.",3,31,66,22 April 2015
Friends with Benefits," Moderate fun
","Friends With Benefits was definitely fun, and it was what I was expecting. And yes, of course it was easily predictable, but what kind of romantic comedy isn't? Friends With Benefits was mostly simple and fun, easy to watch.Most of the sex scenes are very good, they weren't made too deep nor were they just physical action which would make you awkward, hoping nobody enters the room. It was realistic and showed how fun sex can be with the real person, which is something movies don't usually show you. Movies just try to glamorize sex way too much, in Friends With Benefits it was very casual.I'm not so sure about Justin Timberlake's acting though. He seemed decent, but not particularly good. Mila Kunis however, is brilliant and funny as always. Also she's gorgeous, which makes the movie easier to watch.I was kind of hoping more from Woody Harrelson's character, but every time he opens his mouth, they just had to point out how gay the character is. I think the audience got it after the first time yet still it needs to be said so many times it felt like the only feature the character had. Sexual minorities need much better representation than this. The whole story felt like it would be making fun of them, but still they ended up using them. I can't decide if the movie was ironically playing with the clichÃ©s or if it fell into its own trap.Friends With Benefits is fun, but I can't imagine watching it a second time. There are way better romantic comedies, like Keeping The Faith, but sure it's worth one watch.",7,0,1,24 April 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Everything is going downhill
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the first Harry Potter movie directed by David Yates. Some fans love Yates and his different style, but there are people who don't like him, myself included. Sure, he's the one responsible for my favourite half of the series, where Harry is growing up and everything is darker. But in the movies the characters aren't as deep and the darkness feels more like a colour scheme than a change in the story telling.Yates's style chooses action over the story - which makes no sense when considering what the novel was like. Order of the Phoenix had very little action, but it explored wonderfully, for example, Harry after seeing Voldemort returning and seeing Cedric Diggory being brutally murdered. In the movie you can see it bothers Harry, he is incredibly angry, but that's that. If you haven't read the book it only seems like Harry is having his puberty and therefore a bit moody, even if you could claim he has a case of PTSD. There are many emotional scenes in the novel that weren't included in the movie. They were completely forgotten or replaced by something really, really weird, apart from few that were important to the plot - they saved the scenes that were important when looking at this one movie, but ignored the story as a whole, and they seemed to figure character development was not that important. Harry Potter series is not seven separate stories it's one story in seven parts. At this point it's clear the filmmakers didn't care about the story as much as making the movies and making fans watch them and just get through the whole series. But it's lovely to see the film allowing few characters develop properly: like Neville during the DA. They tried to fake Ginny developing as well by only showing us that she is indeed amazing with spells. Still the filmmakers have forgotten to give her any sort of personality. I love her in the books but in movies she's just an empty husk - skillful of course, but she's not as interesting as in the books. ' Order of Phoenix is over-simplified and is trying to force a story into a film form in the easiest way possible. Yes, sure, they didn't have so much time to focus on the stories individually considering the stars were growing up but still, this is ridiculous.",4,9,13,18 October 2016
Men in Black," Modern sci-fi needs to revisit this
","This movie is simply so lovable, and it has affected many people who have seen it. Men In Black has such a nice atmosphere, and it's not gritty and dark as science fiction or fantasy written these days. How many people have seen this movie and were immediately (not entirely seriously) convinced aliens have visited us? When it's a movie like Men In Black, it's so much more fun believing aliens might exist. There are movies that make aliens seem like killing machines whose only purpose is to destroy human race OR they are the kind of wise creatures who are so much better than us. But the aliens in Men In Black are - apart from the villains - almost sympathetic. They seem nice and really ordinary. Most of the charm of this movie comes from Will Smith. He is a talented actor, and his experience in comedy such as Fresh Prince of Bel Air has given him the ability to deliver comedic lines wonderfully. For him they are natural, and while Tommy Lee Jones's character Kay doesn't get as many one-liners, said by him the feeling is different. The character Jay is exactly how many of us would like to be in a situation like this. Of course the aliens and secret organisations are all new to him and he is allowed to be openly confused, but he still seems extremely excited about everything instead of being too broody or too angry like most heroes in action. This movie was made in 1990s, and the effects aren't what we see in the theaters these days, but they are still pretty damn amazing. When we are used to see the extremely beautiful science fiction, something as simple as Men In Black is a nice change. Men In Black is simple science fiction comedy. It's a movie that made me like science fiction, and is still probably the reason I'm not into the kind of science fiction where everything is in space and where you can see the filmmakers tried way too hard. Men In Black has a quite simple setting, quite simple plots and ordinary characters. Jay could be anyone of us, chosen by almost randomly instead of having some kind of great destiny. This is what science fiction needs to revisit. This is amazing.",10,5,7,16 July 2016
Saw," More like a thriller than gore horror
","The idea I've had of the Saw movies has been that they are mostly senseless stodge, gore done for no other purpose but score, and especially I've been very doubtful because of the several sequels. Even gore movies should be done with some other purpose than money. I can't yet say if I'm wrong or right: I've only seen the first, and considering the director (and writers) seem to be different in the others, the first one might still be way better than the others.But I was pleasantly surprised by the plot - no matter how weird the choice of words may seem. The plot was extremely intriguing in a way, but it could've been much simpler - and that way more effective. What if we'd lose most of the flashbacks in the film, so for the most part it would be just the two men in the room, talking to each other, until the crucial point something else is revealed? That's what I thought during the film, but now that I've seen it I can see how important the flashbacks were, but before the end they just felt unnecessary way to make the film longer. But everything did wrap up nicely. Still the plot is quite simple. I mean is there anything unnecessary in it? There's not too much violence, and the film is about 1,5 hours. The plot is so much closer to thriller mystery than gore horror. That's something I won't expect from the sequels, if I ever end up watching them. I think they might be overplaying the gore parts and downplaying the mysteries - but what we already found out in definitely why the mystery in the sequels would be ruined. But still, I can't say yet. This is just my speculation.The cinematography bothered me the most. It seemed tacky and bad, and the sped up effects seemed just ridiculously stupid. Sure, the way this film was shot gave it a certain atmosphere, but it was quite annoying to look at.Saw was a great movie, which I'd prefer to call thriller than horror. I'm still surprised how it isn't as violent as everyone always said it was. It's simple yet it surprises you. Saw is an amazing film, and I didn't think I'd like it, but here I am.",8,0,2,26 April 2016
Reservoir Dogs," A film made skilfully and with just the right amount of passion
","A story about a heist gone wrong has been dealt with over and over again, but Reservoir Dogs definitely gives something new to that story as old as Hollywood at least. You never see the heist that went wrong. You see the characters before and after. Then you just hear what the characters saw. That's why the dialogue in this movie is so important, because without it, we wouldn't know anything about what happened. But if several people see one event, they all see different things. So are we sure exactly how it happened based on what the characters said? Do we need to be? The beginning of Reservoir Dogs is legendary with its sharp and witty dialogue. That opening dialogue could be from anyone's life, anyone could have the same conversation. But in this case it just happens to be between men who are about to rob a jewellery store, because why would they talk any differently compared to other people? The nonlinear narrative let's you know what you need to know precisely when that information is useful to you. If the story was completely linear, the excitement wouldn't be so great. If you knew right from the beginning who set them up then watching Reservoir Dogs would be a lot more boring.Many scenes lack the soundtrack, which just makes the tension in the warehouse grow. But whenever there is music, it is always well chosen. Stuck In The Middle With You is such a light-hearted little song, yet it feels like completely different song after this film. Tarantino knows how to use time. Not one part of Reservoir Dogs in unnecessary. And only the things we really don't need are left out. Usually people either try to force a movie to be 1,5 hours, or they try to make it slow so it feels longer. Both of these are wrong. Each film needs a certain amount of time, and there's no point trying to make it longer or shorter.Reservoir Dogs is an amazing movie. There's not a moment there that I don't enjoy watching, even if they include gallons of blood.",10,0,0,15 January 2016
Pulp Fiction," There's no denying it, one of the best movies ever made
","My first memory of Pulp Fiction was when I was very young, and my father had borrowed the soundtrack, and he listened to it. And I still remember listening to the beginning, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogue, followed by Misirlou. I don't have any idea why it had such an impact on me, but I remembered that for so long. And the soundtrack of this film continues to enchant me! There are so many songs in this film that are absolute gold. I already mentioned Misirlou, but one exceptionally beautiful track is Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon by Urge Overkill. I saw Pulp fiction for the first time three years ago. I was sixteen then. But this time I did notice there were several details I missed - or have since then forgotten. It's great how you can watch a film again and it still feels kind of new.I love the colour palette of Pulp Fiction. Especially the colour red is very strong. And I have no complaints about the cinematography whatsoever, it really looks amazing. And the design of many locations is great. I especially love Jack Rabbit Slims, the 50's themed restaurant Mia and Vincent Vega go to. It looks absolutely ridiculous of course, very extravagant, but that's why it's so amazing. It's so detailed.Pulp Fiction sure has it's cult classic reputation. I think almost everyone with Internet has seen pictures and GIFs of Pulp Fiction, even if they haven't seen the film itself. That's why watching the film is weirdly surreal. You know so many scenes, but when they are put together, they are perfect, even if so many scenes are legendary even on their own: Samuel L. Jackson's monologue, The dance scene. Several pieces of dialogue. They are all amazing and so many people know them, but when you see them all in a film, it's... surreal.The characters of Pulp Fiction never seize to amaze me. Like I said about Reservoir Dogs, the characters are closer to people than devices to carry out the story. None of them is a hero, none of them is a villain. They have virtues, they have vices. Of course they are devices for the story, that's what characters do, but even when they do their job for the plot, they still have lives outside of the story. Even if the film doesn't shove their regular life to your face, you can still feel it.Pulp Fiction is good. It is most definitely good, it's amazing. Of course I like to think sometimes that it is completely overrated, but whenever I watch it again - or even see an out-of-context piece of the film, I remember that it is one of the best films ever made.",10,1,2,15 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great children's fantasy
","Chris Columbus has mostly directed movies for the whole family. His imprint is clear. The first Harry Potter movie is clearly a very childlike fantasy. It's mostly aimed for children, and no one's trying to hide it. Sure, people of all ages can watch it, and the book isn't just meant for kids, but the movie is just so clearly meant for children, which can make it slightly annoying. But it's fascinating to see how that changes when the series goes on. The movies change a lot considering their target audience was growing up the whole time, and they eventually look like a dark young adult fantasy instead of this colourful fantasy for children..This first movie adaptation annoys me so much. They've followed the book closely, some lines are straight from the book. Yet so much is missing. So many important details are gone. Of course not everything can make it to the film but still it bothers many viewers who have read the books. Also even if the movie is long it seems to happen so fast. It's an entertaining movie but after so any years they lose some of their magic. It's sad, of course, but it's mostly the fault of the audience (in this case, me) and not the movies.",6,0,1,15 October 2016
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," So much worse...
","After the magnificent Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire is just a horrible downgrade. Yes, the book is long and there's no way every scene would be in it, but so much has been left behind. The beginning is butchered, so is the school year. Now it seems like nothing else happened except for the Triwizard Tournament. The main characters had like one class during the entire year. They should've made the movie longer. Three hours may be a long movie, but it's better to make it long than make it seem like all this happened in few months instead of one school year. Seasons barely changed!This film includes the one change everyone hates: Dumbledore was supposed to calmly ask Harry if he put his name in the goblet of fire, but for some reason Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is furious 24/7 and even violent. It makes no sense. Of course Dumbledore is quite a reckless headmaster, but with Richard Harris he seemed gentle, just the right way. If Michael Gambon can't pull of that kind of gentleness, they should've cast someone else. Everyone loved Harris, he was the perfect Dumbledore. After he died, did the people in charge of casting just think, 'Ah, f@#k it, let's choose someone completely different'. One thing I like is how dark the ending is. It's a good prelude to how dark the last movies are going to be. Of course now it seems like the movies are starting to be too scary for kids. It's hard for me to watch few scenes because of how gruesome they are, so how do they except children to watch them? All the charm Prisoner of Azkaban is gone. If one Harry Potter movie clearly needs a remake, it's this one.",5,0,3,17 October 2016
The Shape of Water," One word: Beautiful
","There's one word I'd use to describe The Shape of Water: Beautiful. It's beautiful in so many ways:The story and especially the love aspect of the story feels more genuine than anything I've seen in ages. The love between the characters develop and while it's of course unusual, it feels more real that way. All the characters in typical romantic movies are the same, but Elisa and the 'amphibious creature' are different from those characters. Alexandre Desplat's score was also astonishing. It was light, simple and after the film ends it makes you feel like you're half dancing out of the theatre. And of course we can't talk about beauty of a film without talking about the visual side. The cinematography is stunning. The film is unbelievably colourful. I especially love the use of green and blue throughout the movie. Honestly, this is what I hope I could achieve one day as a cinematographer. The Shape of Water is a beautiful film in so many ways, while still managing to be brutal when needed. Totally a masterpiece, worth all the nominations and awards.",10,36,66,17 February 2018
Hancock," Refreshing superhero movie
","Hancock has been on my watchlist since I really started liking Will Smith, which was about a year ago. When I finally managed to watch it, I didn't know much about it, apart from it being hopefully a different kind of superhero movie.At first the movie feels refreshingly simpler compared to the epic superhero movies we keep getting. It felt like most of the idea came from how in those epic superhero movies the heroes cause a lot of damage to the city and its people. But as the story goes forward the story does become richer and, even if I hate the word, more epic.It's refreshing to see a character like Hancock. He is like an asshole, clearly an antihero (it's already refreshing not to see a brooding white man antihero, mind you), but there's more to him. And what's important we actually can see how he feels about the people kind of hating him, even if he tries to save them. It's not just superficially shrugged off. I also love how the music is used so well with the story. When the movie becomes more like a superhero movie the soundtrack feels more like a classic score for that type of movies. Hancock is an entertaining and a surprisingly good superhero movie. I think I would've preferred something simpler, something more refreshing, but Hancock is good for what it is. Of course it's a bit typical, but it has several new elements, and it has great cast. And while the story is not great, there are a lot of things I like about it. Hancock definitely is worth seeing whether or not you are tired with the typical Marvel or DC movies we get.",8,6,9,16 June 2017
Hitch," The perfect romantic comedy
","Hitch is an amazing, light romantic comedy. I was suspicious at first, but Smith's character Alex Hitchen charmed me right away. He works with actually nice men who want a relationship instead of a- holes, which is the key element that makes the character lovable. Mostly this movie works because of the characters. Hitchen is sweet, clever and honestly seems like the perfect man. Sara is clever, and while she has some typical romantic comedy tropes, she's still quite well written. All relevant characters grow significantly during the film. And it's amazing to see a romantic comedy about a black guy and a Latina woman without any annoying racial stereotypes - though of course I am no expert on this, so feel free to correct me.Hitch just is an excellent movie. It's the perfect romantic comedy. It's sometimes ridiculous, but also genuinely funny. And it's so sweet and I enjoyed almost every second of it. apart from the typical plot structure, and those few moments that almost frightened me that the film wouldn't go the way I'd want it to - because when you're watching romantic comedies, it's important the films don't just knock you to the ground. They are for fun, and the audience doesn't necessarily need some huge plot twist that the writers came up with just so they could change the whole genre and be fake artsy.In short this is a really nice movie, something I genuinely liked, even if I sometimes am a bit cynical towards romantic comedies. This movie made me smile and feel all warm inside. I definitely recommend this.",10,0,1,16 August 2016
The Conjuring," Could've been better
","The plot is annoying. A white family moves in to a house, something horrible starts to happen and no one comes up with the simple idea to MOVE OUT OF THE NEW HOUSE.There were few scenes during which I had to keep my eyes closed - not because it was that terrifying, but because you just knew there were going to be some jumpscares. Jumpscares are effective in like the very moment they come to you, but they don't leave you paranoid or scared after the movie ends. Jumpscares are a cheap tactic to get you scared on that very second but not a moment longer. And this movie could've been terrifying if it wasn't for so many 'scary' scenes that just looked absolutely ridiculous. And you know what is the most terrifying thing? When you can't see the evil. Many of the spirits in this movie seemed ridiculous, and it could've been horrifying if we hadn't seen them at all. Decent horror film, but there are so many things that could've been done better.",4,1,2,11 July 2016
Wonder Woman," Amazing!
","Wonder Woman is an amazing superhero movie, and this comes from someone who's a bit tired of superhero movies already, and is really picky about which ones they're going to see. It stands out for several reasons, one of them being that there are more elements from fantasy than science fiction in this movie.First and most important and obvious thing has to be the fact that it has a female lead. It's ridiculous that it has taken this long for DC or Marvel to actually make a movie with a woman playing the main role, considering there are amazing heroines in the comic books. Diana is an amazing character, because while she's being a hero and kicking ass, she can still be a woman. There are tons of characters who are 'strong female characters' while strength being their only defining characteristic. But Diana actually has feelings and is feminine without being just eye candy for the male viewers, while still looking absolutely stunning, though. One thing that bothers me is the excessive use of CGI and slow motion and all that, but Wonder Woman definitely isn't the only movie guilty of that.Storywise this movie is enjoyable, and I felt amazing after I saw that. Is that how men feel all the time when they see other men in superhero movies constantly?",8,2,9,23 August 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I didn't believe this would be so bad...
","Oh look, more disappointments caused by superhero movies! I saw the ultimate edition of this movie, and that's three disastrously bad hours spent in front of the TV. On the other hand I heard a lot of people wanted exactly this from superhero movies, and others hated this film. I can understand the hate better than how anyone can like this.I didn't like Suicide Squad, but after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which is a uselessly long name, Suicide Squad seems much better. For instance, Suicide Squad had interesting, in-depth characters. Most of them were knew to me, but it didn't matter, because the film introduced them well. However everyone knows who Batman and Superman are, so even if Batman is now a new character, his introduction was incredibly short, and the audience just has to accept this new Batman immediately, even if his character is left a bit hollow. Ben Affleck is an amazing Batman, but the writing doesn't give him any justice. Superman has always seemed a bit boring, and he doesn't seem to get any better in this film. So we have two hollow characters. Who are we supposed to root for, when neither of them seem at least a bit interesting?Many of the scenes seem disconnected from each other, until it extremely slowly starts to become a one whole movie. Even when it is a one whole thing, it seems like it is patched together in the worst possible way. It's confusing and annoying. Yes, superhero movies could be a bit 'smarter' but no, they don't necessarily need three hours and this kind of slow rhythm. Still, there are far too many dream sequences. They are almost always annoying, and they definitely don't go well with superhero action movies. They seem like a bad try to make this film seem deeper than it is.There were a few intriguingly dark details, like the written notes for Wayne and the 'Joke's on you Batman', but none of those were explore as much as I hoped they would be. The dark cinematography could've been interesting, but I feel like I missed a lot of details because of it. It was hard to follow and see what was going on.The best part of this movie is Lex Luthor. I know basically nothing about him, because my interest to Superman is very limited. Jesse Eisenberg was an interesting choice, but he shines brighter than anything else in this movie.I did not like this movie. It was annoying to watch and I wish I had watched to shorter version. Maybe it wouldn't feel so much like just empty disconnected scenes. Still, there's no way the characters are any less hollow in the short version. It seems like these days 20th Century Fox is making the best superhero movies when DC and Marvel Studios are both so disappointing.",2,1,4,22 August 2016
Trainspotting," If I had to choose...
","...a favourite movie from the year I was born, it would definitely be Trainspotting. The first novel I read by Welsh was Filth, and his writing style is absolutely fascinating. With Filth I was bored and then watched the movie and realised holy s**t, I wasn't even at the important parts yet. So I returned to the book and while I had already seen the movie it still was able to blow my mind. Welsh, whose last name will never stop being amusing to me, is a really brilliant writer. One of the best things about Trainspotting is its dialogue. I haven't read Trainspotting as much as I'd want to, but I have a vague idea how much of the dialogue comes from him. The dialogue has a weird charm. It sounds real, like what you and your mates could talk about, but also makes you feel like why can't your conversations go like that. But still it's not entirely like Tarantino's dialogue, which is realistic, but also sometimes there's no point. With Trainspotting there are typical, realistic conversations about... whatever, but also there's a lot of plot related dialogue with some really witty notions here and there.What seems to be typical to Welsh's style is that he takes his time. It takes a while to understand what it's about, or it takes a weirdly long time to get to the things the summary at the back cover said about the story (The bedroom secrets of master chefs). It's kind of the same with Trainspotting as a movie. It's hard to say what it's about without being vague about it. 'Oh it's about young men in Edinburgh struggling with drugs and such'. Yeah but what happens? It's easier to just know the whole thing.Trainspotting's way of portraying drugs is also interesting compared to many others. Either movies are trying to praise drugs or they are trying to make them seem like devil himself invented them. In Trainspotting they tell straight out what's good about drugs while some of them try to get off it. Like drugs are obviously bad, it's not like anyone's hiding it, but they're also very clear about why it's so hard to quit, and how even after quitting you can still relapse. I love surrealism in Trainspotting. Sometimes it just feels like a special effect. Sometimes it feels like it's strongly related to what's going on, how the characters are feeling. It can distressing or it can be really hilarious.The soundtrack of Trainspotting is iconic! There are so many brilliant songs that reflect the time and also suit the story well, instead of being just separate sounds in the background.Trainspotting is a masterpiece. It's a true cult classic and I'll be forever bitter to that one friend of a friend who claimed that Fear and Loathing portrayed drugs better but eh, she turned out to be junkie few years later, so what can you say?",10,0,1,2 March 2017
X2: X-Men United," Basic
","I remember the times when I was so into X-men and I basically followed everyone else's opinion on the movies. People said (because of the comic books) X2 is one of the best movies because it built the Phoenix Saga and all that, and X-Men: The Last Stand was horrible and so on. But I have to admit, I'd rather watch The Last Stand. Mostly because that movie simply looks better, and also because I want to watch a movie and not just judge it based on the comics I haven't even read.The dialogue in X2 is annoyingly clumsy, and the writing isn't too special in other ways neither. I get that superhero movies aren't usually very original, but the plot structure of X2 is so basic it's annoying. The most intriguing thing about this film is the metaphor of mutants and the moral dilemmas, but compared to the first X-men movie or The Last Stand there's really no way to choose a side in this film. Superhero movies are usually extremely black-and-white: you know who the good guys are, you know who the bad guys are. Magneto sometimes brings the moral grey areas into the mix, but because he isn't the main antagonist of X2, the movie doesn't offer that anymore. Everyone watching X2 knows Stryker is horrible, it's not even up to debate. X2 is an alright superhero action movie, but doesn't offer anything interesting to the viewer, but were you expecting anything other than the usual stuff superhero movies throw our ways?",7,1,3,5 May 2016
Lucy," Completely different from what I expected
","When I first saw the trailer, I thought this would be some kind of superhero movie - maybe not saving the world, but some kind of origin story. Well, as it turns out, I was wrong. Apparently 'superpowers' don't always equal superheroes in cinema. That's actually very good. I'm glad that this didn't turn out to be some mindless superhero action movie with ray guns and all that stuff, even if this isn't on the same level with the actually deep, astonishing science fiction movies.Cinematography was astonishing. The effects were good, and most of the scenes were very clear, and it was easy to keep track on what was going on and were.Lucy is slightly interesting as a character, but only because of this mystery around her. We don't know who she is, we know only small things that are kind of useless little facts. But all that interest I had in her vanished after she started to change into this typical godlike character who is in some way superior to others, and just knows everything, knows how to do everything, and then just sits there and explains things we don't know about our word so expressionlessly it's almost painful.But to be honest this movie was disturbingly, well, racist. Mostly because of in the beginning this was a lot of 'White woman killing scary Asian men'. Come one, she shot one just because he didn't speak English, that is disturbing considering were she was. If you don't think about the racist parts for a while - and I know a lot of people won't - this movie is pretty good. However, I think it might lose its magic after the first time, and you probably can't watch this every weekend. But still, it's visually stunning, interesting and worth seeing.",8,8,15,29 May 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," This is so bad
","This movie is bulls**t! There is so many useless scenes and they make me angry! They decided to make two movies out of one book, they cut many scenes out and then come up with scenes that don't exist and make no sense. I'd ask, but I know why: money. Two movies make more money than one. The people behind these films don't care about story telling they do this thinking about dollar signs - or pound signs, since it's a British film.The original novel is so sad. There are so many significant deaths of characters you never feared would die. And in the movie those scenes are butchered. You briefly see someone dying - or you don't even see them dying, they just are dead all of a sudden. It's a lousy way to do this, because the emotional response from the audience isn't as great as when reading the novel. First part had the tale of three brothers that was so beautiful and amazing. The second part has nothing beautiful. Everything is million times faster and all the important pieces of information are lost. It's annoying!I don't know if I can express my anger and frustration towards the series any better. Everything is wrong, and there are so many weird and awkward scenes that just don't go with the original story. The only thing that brings life to this movie is the cast, but many actors and actresses are now seen for maybe five minutes and that's it. They should've given more thought to how this movie is going to go down. Agh!",2,1,2,4 November 2016
Looper," Doesn't get better with time.
","I went to see Looper when it came out in Finland, and I was in love with it since then. I've always liked the idea of the story. It's complicated in the way time travelling stories are always complicated. Still the plot is mostly straight forward and it's clear what people want. Also it's brutal just in the right way.Of course if you're serious about the time travel aspect, sometimes the time travel paradox doesn't seem to make awful lot of sense, but if you're just in it for an action thriller then you're going to be fine.One of the weirdest things in this movie is to see Joseph Gordon Levitt look like Bruce Willis. Like he pulls that off, and it's not completely awful, but it just look odd. You could've made that happen some other way too, not just make JGL copy Bruce Willis completely... I'm usually not a big fan of science fiction, but when it comes to only small doses of science fiction, I might love it. With Looper the only doses of sci-fi are the time travel element and the telekinetic abilities possessed by some of the characters. Even if time travelling is a key element in the story, it doesn't make the story feel too futuristic. The weapons look pretty regular and there are only few futuristic looking vehicles in the world. This makes it possible for the story not explain the world too much. It looks and works pretty much like ours apart from the few details that are explained very clearly. It's not necessarily only a good thing: you might want to know more about the world, but you can't. You can only see the slightly dystopian aspect on how there are clearly wealthier people partying and then there's so much poverty on the streets and all that.If I absolutely hate something about this movie it's the sound mixing. Sometimes watching this movie is painful because the characters talk quietly but then there's all that action noises and shouting... It's easier if you have subtitles on, then you don't have to blast the movie on full volume. I often stop paying attention to it, but there's that one diner scene where I always pay attention to it, it's just super annoying.It's always a risk to rewatch a movie you used to like 5-6 years back, because you might ruin it, but also can you be neutral in reviewing it if you already like it? The thing about Looper is that while it's a good action movie, watching it too many times doesn't make it good, unfortunately. It's still alright, and there are still some scenes that are breath-taking, but everything between those few amazing scenes feels dull.",7,1,1,23 January 2018
What We Do in the Shadows," Uniquely funny mockumentary
","I have seen a lot of footage of this movie, so I finally decided watch it. This movie is an excellent mockumentary, and absolutely hilarious. I love how they used very classic vampires instead of trying to make a modern version where they leave out certain parts of the myth or come up with new features for the vampires. What We Do In The Shadows is a brilliant fantasy-horror-comedy, and in its way very unique. It's definitely entertaining and well made, even if it's not really my type as a movie.",7,1,2,30 May 2017
Deadpool," Better than the garbage Marvel usually throws our way
","Last year I said I hated Avengers Age of Ultron because it was just throwing one-liners at the audience. And yes, Deadpool was one one- liner after another, but Deadpool is different. It has substance where Avengers doesn't. It has a character we've been waiting for so many years. The movie is hilarious. Basically the audience got to laugh almost all the time. I think it's almost useless to say that Deadpool was funny, because we have been able to see that from the trailers and the marketing of this film alone.The story was good. It was very similar to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, to be honest. Wilson gets new powers through experimentation he agreed to, but which turned out to go not as smoothly as previously thought, and then he hunts down the people who did that to him - and of course there's romance. But Deadpool does that story way better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, mostly because it doesn't ruin any characters and other story lines while doing so. Quite the opposite: Deadpool introduces old familiar characters (Colossus) and some really cool new characters (Negasonic Teenage Warhead), and doesn't ruin them. And in Deadpool Colossus has the right accent, because I don't remember him having any accents in the other movies we saw him. Did he even talk in those? I doubt it.The action scenes were alright. But the thing is, in superhero movies - especially anything related to X-Men - I kind of hope to see a lot of different mutant powers during those fights. Like sure, we might not know who those people are, but the powers are cool. Well, here we had like two villain mutates, and both had pretty boring skills. Of course Negasonic Teenage Warhead - whom I am in love with - pretty much made up for everything else.I love the soundtrack of this movie. Thankfully it's on Spotify!Deadpool is kind of like one of those new wave superhero stuff, like Kick-Ass: incredibly violent and filled with twisted jokes. However, comparing Deadpool to anything else than a superhero movie, it's just decent. And of course I have to compare it to my favourite action movie, compared to which Deadpool is only okay. Deadpool was everything I wanted it to be - it was funny in a lot of different ways, it had enjoyable battle scenes and cool characters. It might not be the best action movie there is, but it definitely beats every Avenger movie there is. It's kind of like one of those new wave superhero stuff, like Kick-Ass: incredibly violent and filled with twisted jokes. Deadpool is worth your money, because ever comic book geek is going to love it.",7,6,16,14 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," I want more
","I mostly watched this movie because I saw so much about it on Tumblr and other places. It was only afterwards I realised Kingsman was directed by Matthew Vaughn, but I shouldn't have been surprised, his style was all over this. And that's definitely a good thing, Vaughn is amazing at action-comedies.Many of the characters were really interesting, really unique. Especially the villain was great. You both can and can't take him seriously. Even the idea of Samuel L. Jackson being cast as a villain who feels sick when he sees even a drop of blood, that is hilarious.The action scenes were amazing. They were little hard to keep a track on, but the little details showed kind of made up for that. The soundtrack is amazing: it's modern electronic action soundtrack meets classic spy movies meets Kick-Ass.The feeling I got afterwards is: I want more. I want more movies like this. Kingsman was fun, exciting and it had a certain charm. Amazing movie, everyone who loved Kick-Ass needs to see Kingsman.",7,1,6,13 June 2015
Jackie Brown," Very clever film
","I remember that Jackie Brown was on television once. I didn't watch it, but I remember seeing a short trailer or something. The story of Jackie Brown is well written for sure, but it feels like something is missing. The story works well and it thrilling and intriguing. I haven't read the original novel, but the fault lies either in the novel and story itself or Tarantino's ability to adapt the novel for screen. Not that it is a big problem, not every story can be extremely unique and one of a kind stories - the most important thing is that the story works. One weakness for the story is that for a moment in the beginning it alienates the audience, when they don't know the whole idea yet, and they are just trying to follow. Now it's easy to catch up and things do become much clearer, but for a moment there the viewer might not have a clue on what's going on - especially when they haven't read a summary or anything. Jackie Brown is also an interesting character, considering that for a moment you have no idea who she is lying to and whose side she is on. The only thing you can count on is that this whole thing better be good for her. And Pam Grier, oh my god, I think I am in love with her. She's an amazing actress and so beautiful. I love the music in this movie. Makes me think of some extravagant 70's police show.Jackie Brown is a very clever film. It's thrilling and it has an amazing cast. I definitely want to read the novel.",9,1,1,16 January 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," Amazing and thrilling
","The story is intriguing, and it shows the worst and best of India. It shows the slums and brutality, but also the glamour of the rich. And the line between the two is clear, because not everyone is happy to just let a 'slumdog' to become a millionaire and change the dynamic. But of course that's not just India, this is pretty much every country, where the differences between the poor and the rich are growing.And this movie is so thrilling. Towards the end I was ready to scream, because I was so excited. I was hopeful and scared at the same time and had no idea what would happen to Jamal, would he get the answer right or wrong. One of the key features of this film is the structure. The narrative isn't chronological, and instead it's mostly told in flashbacks. That's always risky, but in Slumdog Millionaire it's used amazingly. It tells you what you need to know and when you need to know it, not sooner than needed. This gives that certain air of mystery when you don't yet know everything, but you want to.I wasn't really into the love story, but also I couldn't think what would make it better, so I probably shouldn't go into that.Slumdog Millionaire is an amazing movie, very thrilling. There were several little things bothering me, but all in all it's astonishing and definitely deserved its win.",8,0,4,26 March 2017
The Nice Guys," Fun and thrilling
","I meant to go see The Nice Guys when it first came to the theatres, but I don't remember why I didn't go. I finally rented it. Most of what I had seen before seemed great. A mutual from tumblr seems to like this movie and constantly reblogs GIF-sets and screencaps from this movie. All that dialogue seemed wild and fun, so I thought it'd be right up my alley.An almost constant thought that followed me through the movie was 'this reminds me of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. No wonder, since it's directed by the same guy. Shane Black really handles neo-noir films very well. Few especially great details were the internal monologues at the beginning of the movie. They were like straight from old time-y film noirs, but way more fun. The plot was way more intriguing than anticipated. From the screenshots and GIF-sets The Nice Guys seemed more like a comedy than actually thrilling crime mystery. The plot is complex, and it's actually very satisfying and entertaining to see how the story goes, what was going on, all that.One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the 70's aesthetic and music. I've always had a soft spot for 70's fashion, so movies from the past few years set in the 70's are great at least aesthetically speaking.The Nice Guys is definitely a fun, thrilling movie, tho I am sceptical if it would be as good the second time.",8,1,2,20 March 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," F##king action movie masterpiece!!
","Of course I had heard a lot of good about Mad Max: Fury Road. Hell, it won six Oscars! But of course it's different to actually see it for yourself than just to rely on the opinions of others.It's clear that this movie is different from the typical action movies that we get nowadays from every f##king movie studio that exists. There's something unique in the story and of course visually this movie beats any other action movie out there. While the story is a bit dark and it has very serious themes in it, there's a somewhat loose feeling to it. The movie can be taken seriously, but there's a somewhat relaxed feeling to the things they've come up with. The filmmakers are pros and they know what they are doing, so if they want to add a flamethrower electric guitar in there, they can and they should - and it will be f##king awesome. That flamethrower electric guitar reminds me, since I haven't seen the original movies I can't help but feel that I'm missing something. Why is there a guitar and war drums on a car? Is that... normal? Is that a regular thing or is Immortan Joe just a drama queen who needs his own theme music? It's cultural stuff like that that I don't know, but in the end that didn't seem to matter that much. But at least it feels like there's a world outside this movie, that the post-apocalyptic Australian wasteland has a culture, instead of just those three or four tribes we get to see.Mad Max: Fury Road may be a bit long, and definitely feels longer than it is, but it's worth it. The audience wants desperately to see what happen, they desperately want a happy ending, all that. I was on the edge of my seat, even though during the start of the movie I was indifferent towards it. Visually... I've never seen an action movie that looks like this. The editing is amazing, so are the effects, which might have something to do with the fact that they used CGI very little. But the cinematography... It's astonishingly beautiful. Every shot seems to be careful, and the colours are mind-blowing. Also the costume department has done such an amazing job, and all the vehicles look amazing... Everything in this movie just stands out from the typical post-apocalyptic action movie, and it's amazing.Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing post-apocalyptic action movie, that definitely stands out from all the s##t that's out there. It's different, original, and just so damn thrilling and beautiful. It's a f##king action movie masterpiece! What are the originals like? If they are anything like this, I have to see them!",10,4,9,2 August 2017
Evil Dead II," Great
","I liked the first Evil Dead and I finally manage to rent the second one. The whole debate on whether or not this is a sequel or a remake did create some confusion when watching, though, but afterwards IMDb gave some real answers though. Thank god for that site, huh?I was going to start the review by saying how much better Evil Dead II is story-wise, but since it's a sequel and all the inconsistencies in the beginning are there mostly to give a short recap, I can't really say that anymore. Instead I can say that while Evil Dead was mostly horror, ghosts and blood, Evil Dead II gives something new to the story, it gives lore. And for me, interesting lore is always a big plus. The audience wants to know more, they are intrigued.And luckily Evil Dead II is a wonderful introduction to the Army of Darkness, which is like a big promise on more lore and background to the movies. But pretty much whatever I said about the first movie goes here too. The cinematography is weird but interesting. Time is used effectively - movie is only 80 minutes long yet a lot manages to happen in that 80 minutes. The effects are completely awful but mostly they make creepy situations even creepier. In short, Evil Dead II may be a weird sequel but it gives something new to the story and I really want to see Army of Darkness already.",6,1,2,22 May 2017
Up in the Air," I feel so miserable now
","I was just browsing Netflix when I stumbled upon Up in the Air. I hadn't heard about it before, but I decided to watch it anyway.First of all, is that a real job? Can someone's job actually be firing people in other companies? It might be a better system for the employers, but that must suck for a) employees and b) the person who has to fire like hundred people in a month, if not more. Yikes. While it might not be the main point of this film, Up in the Air can show how annoying it might be the employees when everything is computerized. Sure, some co-workers of Ryan Bingham may enjoy how they don't have to leave their hometown and all that, but Bingham is used to travelling. He points out that the airport is his home. And let's be honest, firing people through computers might be extremely alienating, when they can't even be in the same room with the person who is telling them their position is no longer available. Also this kind of job would be more interesting if you can actually see 'the world' (mostly the U.S. but still) while doing so. Also the main character's philosophy is interesting. It's basically telling you to give up everything, because every commitment you have weighs you down and stops you from going forward. He makes me think of a weird version of Tyler Durden, except Ryan Bingham isn't running a group of terrorists. Ryan Bingham is an interesting character, considering many people have probably dreamed of a life like that: you don't have to contact your family, but you're not alone, because you meet new people every day. You're alone in the sense that you don't have to commit to relationships, but you're not actually lonely. But when you see the film, you start realising how empty Bingham's life really is, and that gets to you. While some people certainly could be satisfied by Bingham's life choices, you start wondering what if you couldn't pull it off? Because of that this film makes me think of Alfie. In that film, a womanizer Alfie is so happy with his life, but eventually he realises how empty his life is. I think Bingham has the same kind of realization. During most of the film the viewer feels miserable. It's like nothing good happens. The part that's supposed to be happy - Bingham's sister's wedding - is completely drowned in a melancholy music, which makes it seem like even then Bingham isn't actually happy because he is missing all of that, and that's... It feels faux. And because of most of the latter part of the film is so melancholy and miserable, it makes you think if there were any kind of happy moments in this film.The biggest disappointment in this film has to be the soundtrack. The first song is extremely good, but the actual soundtrack is lame. It does it's job, but you wouldn't listen to the soundtrack when you're doing something else. Up in the Air is a good film in a way - it makes you think about life and all that. But still if you fell completely miserable after the film, and not even in the really sad way that makes you want to cry your eyes out, what's the point? It doesn't give a really good feeling about the film. I had the same experience with Alfie, and I haven't touched that film since. I doubt I'll be seeing this movie ever again.",5,1,1,28 April 2016
