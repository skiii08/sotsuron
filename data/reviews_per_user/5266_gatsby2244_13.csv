The Rock," One Of Sean Connery's Best Films Ever !
","Sean Connery has always been one of my favorite actors,and three decades after letting go of the James Bond label,he proves that he still can do leading roles in action movies.At the age of 66,that is by no means something ordinary.In this film he plays British S.A.S. operative John Patrick Mason who has spent thirty years in prison in the U.S..He is also the only one who escaped from the high security prison Alcatraz,also known as the 'The Rock'. General Francis Hummel,played by Ed Harris is a disillusioned General who decides to take over Alcatraz with a band of loyal Navy Seals and hold its visiting tourists to ransom,in exchange for a hundred million dollars that he believes are due to the families of soldiers killed in action-a fact that has been conveniently overlooked by the government. He threatens to attack San Fransisco with chemical weapons if his demands are not met.The military decides to move in to capture the General,and they call upon Mason to lead them into 'The Rock'. Thus Hummel and Mason clash,and the consequences are fatal.Nicholas Cage is the chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed sent along with Mason into the prison to disarm the rockets set to be launched by Hummel.This of course is an action film,but it is Connery's treatment of his character that makes Mason a lot more than a senile Rambo.He is a ruthless man,but with a golden heart inside him that makes him stand by Goodspeed when the latter's life is in danger,though he could easily seize the opportunity to escape.He is also a doting father who yearns to see his daughter after thirty years.Cage is at his best here,playing the shaky but committed good guy who doesn't hesitate to put his life on the line for his country. Ed Harris does a good job as the erring General,and his failure and death proves the old adage 'violence begets violence'.But it is Connery who towers head and shoulders above everyone else.Whether it is shooting down mercenaries or tearing through the streets of San Fransisco with a Hum-V,this great Scotsman is always in his element.This is his show all the way,and an explosive one at that.A fantastic action flick with a fantastic leading man !",9,2,2,4 May 2005
Minority Report," Very profound,very absorbing
","When you think Spielberg,you think-family entertainment,great CGI,great cinematography.And then you have to watch this film and you are completely bowled over.I was,and I now have developed a new opinion of Spielberg altogether.Yes ,this is a story set in the future,but the plot is novel and anything but merely sci-fi fare.Tom Cruise plays Richard Anderton,who heads a new type of law enforcement agency called Pre-crime.The unique thing about it is that it uses the telepathic abilities of three young people to predict when a crime will happen,and thereby prevent it.Naturally,the system goes wrong and Anderton finds himself a victim of the very system he believed in.The plot is handled very well,and the unexpected twist to the story makes the film all the more fun to watch.Colin Farell plays his part well,and so does Max Van Sydow.The special effects add to the atmosphere of the film,and never become mere gimmicks for entertaining youngsters.A great movie indeed.",Null,0,0,20 April 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Absolutely Fantastic !
","I have been a fan of movies about pirates since I was a kid.This is one genre that has been ignored for a long time.So when 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' hit theaters,I was one of the first in the queue.Recently I managed to get the DVD and I found the movie even better ,now that I have seen it at home.This is definitely one of the best pirate movies ever made.Johnny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow,who is on a quest to recover his ship Black Pearl that has been taken over by his crew by an act of mutiny.The horrible secret is that his entire crew,led by his rebellious first mate Barbosa(played by the magnificent Geoffrey Rush) has been turned into the undead-neither dead nor alive,because they all laid hands on the great conqueror Cortez' gold,stashed away in a secluded island.They can only transform themselves back into the living if they return every piece of the treasure they stole.By chance,the last piece they need is around the neck of the lovely governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann,played by the ravishing Keira Knightley.The plot becomes more complicated when it is discovered that Orlando Bloom,who plays the son of Depp's old partner,Will Turner,is needed to reverse the effects of the curse.Director Gore Verbinski does a great job,keeping the plot together,while providing the movie with both the old-world feel and the state-of-the-art special effects that make this film a feast for the eyes.Johnny Depp is absolutely incredible as Jack Sparrow-positively one of the best pirates I have seen on-screen.His portrayal of the callous,fearless pirate will surely be remembered for a long time.Keira Knightley has come a long way from her ' Bend It Like Beckham 'Days.This is one feisty,breathtaking actress who will surely go a long way !Orlando Bloom is good as the young man of honor,not ready to accept the help of a pirate,but ending up being one.The sword-fighting scenes are extremely well choreographed,and the one between Depp and Bloom at the beginning of the film is easily the best.The ILM guys rarely disappoint,and the 'undead' effects are spine-chillingly convincing.Geoffrey Rush is his usual self,and that means brilliant.The sea atmosphere is superb-after all,the film was shot on location in the Grenadines and the Caribbean.This is a classic movie,and yes , I cannot help but observe that Johnny Depp deserved the Oscar for his performance.It is he who makes the film work.Work like magic.THIS IS GREAT !",Null,1,2,24 April 2005
Spider-Man 2," I Enjoyed It Even After The Tenth Viewing
","There is no need to say that the first Spiderman movie exceeded all expectations from the audience worldwide,and I could not rest till I had the DVD of the film in my possession. One would have thought that this was as far as Hollywood could go ,but 'Spiderman 2' left me speechless. First and foremost,who would think that Sam Raimi could outdo his previous effort,given the fact that most of us were already stunned by the 'Evil Dead' director's first venture into the comic-book genre ? This film completely eclipses the first instalment ,and I'll elaborate on why .There is a new villain in the shape of Dr. Otto Octavius,(played very well by Alfred Molina)who turns into 'Doc Oc', a steely-armed monster bent on world domination.There is also a strong possibility of Mary-Jane- played by one of my favorite actresses,the lovely,talented Kirsten Dunst, ultimately getting together with Peter,that is the incredibly expressive Tobey Maguire.I do not imagine any other duo that could have ignited the screen when Spider-man is NOT in action as these two do.If another remake of Romeo and Juliet were to be made now,I'd say these two actors would turn it into a worldwide blockbuster .It is undeniable that the on-screen chemistry between Dunst and Maguire contributes tremendously to the way the film absorbs all your attention.Rosemary Harris is as convincing as she was the last time we saw her as the adorable Aunt May. The screenplay has a lot more humor in it,and the funny situations are guaranteed to leave audiences in splits all over the world. But in the end it is John Dykstra who makes the film into what it is- a breath-taking thrill-ride aided by mind-blowing special effects.The scenes between Spider-man and Doc Oc are unbelievably 'real' in a way that makes the first film look more like a rough draft of this one ! Dykstra uses every possible scenario to make his character achieve the impossible,and the images stay in your mind long after the film is over. I wrote this review after watching it for the tenth time,so you can guess just how much I liked it.I am sure that this is true not only for me,but for the millions who saw it as well.' Spider-man 3' will hit theaters next year,and most probably it will eclipse the second movie. Because Sam Raimi has proved beyond doubt that his days of churning out second-rate trash are completely over,and I thank him for that.",10,3,3,2 July 2006
The Mummy," A Superb Action Adventure !
","This is one film that caught my imagination like very few other Hollywood action films I have seen before.Yes,on the face of it,this is another sci-fi action adventure,a surefire winning card for Hollywood -what's so special about that ?Oh yes,there is !To begin with,there is the scenery at the beginning of the film that completely blows you away,making you feel that this movie could be something above what you had expected.And you are not wrong.The first surprise is Brendan Fraser as the American soldier Rick O'Connell, who accidentally stumbles upon Hamunaptra,the city of the dead,where the wealth of Egypt's greatest emperor Seti the First is buried.After seeing him in 'Airheads ' ,'Dudley Do-Right ' and ' 'George Of The Jungle',I was very very impressed-this is one actor who can do both comedy and action and look good doing it too !Then there is the beautiful Rachel Weisz ,playing Evelyn Carnahan,who teams up with him to find Hamunaptra.She looks great playing her role,and never allows herself to be upstaged by Fraser, matching his brawn with her ever-alive intellect and quick thinking.Kevin J.O'Connor who plays the double-crossing Beni is a very new kind of villain,looking evil and ridiculous at the same time.But when the resurrected high priest Imhotep( played by Arnold Vosloo)makes his appearance in the form of 'The Mummy', everything else becomes secondary.This is CGI at its ultimate best,and precisely why the film is so unusually absorbing .The horror and threat surrounding the curse of the mummy becomes a concern not only for the protagonists in the film but also for the audience-how will they kill something this scary and powerful?, they ask themselves. .The special effects apart from the mummy are also a treat to watch,and keep you glued to your seat.The element that makes this film not only scary but also enjoyable is the dialog.Almost every member of the large cast has a one-liner that will make you laugh in spite of the sinister atmosphere surrounding the story.The script never allows one second of screen-time to be wasted, ideally combining action with fantasy and humor,creating a movie that I consider a classic.Director Stephen Sommers has delivered a film that is bound to stand the test of time,and is definitely one of my favorites.",9,110,125,30 April 2005
Spider-Man 3," Despite its flaws,better than the first two
","We waited three years for this, the third Spider-Man adventure- and what a long wait that was ! Now I've finally seen it and can only say breathlessly-AWESOME !! It starts with the storyline itself- whereas we only had to concentrate on Doc Ock and one long(though, unforgettable !) duel between him and Spidey in the second instalment, here we are left speechless at the variety of themes that are treated,and deftly brought together by Sam Raimi's masterly direction .The sheer idea of bringing together so much in one film shows just how dedicated Raimi is to his character,and he ends up delivering a near-flawless product, which by the way, has once again broken box-office records all over the world.We are treated to three villains at one go-Sandman,portrayed brilliantly by Thomas Haden Church,Goblin alias Harry Osbourne,and the delightful Topher Grace as Venom.To make things even worse, Peter Parker has to fight his own inner demons too- what could be more entertaining ? Raimi never lets the script get too dark at anytime, and throws in some classic comedy moments into the mix , courtesy J.K. Simmons and the evergreen Bruce Campbell.Both shine in their brief, but memorable on-screen moments.Tobey Maguire has improved greatly as an actor, and it shows right from the start. He still is the centerpiece in this movie, though he is somewhat upstaged( however briefly) by Church and Grace,both of whom are experienced actors. Then there is Kirsten Dunst, who is perfect in her role as MJ, and even impresses with her vocal talents this time ! Of course it's not the first time-she did a pretty good job in ' Get Over It' too. Special mention must be made of Bryce Dallas Howard, who is rather good as Grace's girlfriend, and seems to have a good future ahead of her. She is very easy on the eyes , too. And now to the special effects, which are the first and last reason for anyone to go to see this flick - they are simply UNBELIEVABLE. CGI was never this perfect, never this heart-stopping. Every action sequence is executed with incredible precision , making the train sequence in the second movie look like an antique ! The CGI guys have clearly outdone themselves, and anyone who criticizes them must be out of their minds. Well, there can't be any movie without flaws- and yes, this film has them too. The greatest flaw of Spider-Man 3 is that it actually has no real villains ! Sandman is terrifying, and yet, the way he is dealt with is actually pathetic to see. Goblin and Venom , despite being formidable baddies, end up looking like dilettantes.The film actually ends up looking like a family drama with action thrown in for good measure.And it hurts me to say it.There were teens in the movie-theater next to me who were complaining about too much emotion and character development being thrown in. Maybe they were right.If a fourth movie is to be made(and I am sure it will ), Raimi should spend less screen time on Aunt Mae or MJ crying/brooding/fuming, and give the audience a villain who'll make their blood curdle, yet one who Spidey can take on his own, and NOT with the help of some friend ! Still, all things considered, Spider-Man 3 is a great movie, certainly not to be missed.It clearly outshines both its predecessors,drama or no drama. Great work, Raimi !",10,1,4,9 May 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The Best Terminator Movie Ever !
","There is no denying the fact that the Terminator films are the crowning glory of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career.When I read that part 3 was to hit the theaters soon,I was beside myself with excitement:would this be as good as the previous two ? After I saw it,I had to say:this is the best one of the three! First,Schwarzenegger is in better form than ever.Ten years since the last Terminator movie and who can even notice ?He looks as good,as invincible and what's more,he is more 'human '.The script provides him with a number of one-liners that will surely cause a lot of laughs all over the world.Director Jonathan Mostow does a great job,and frankly, I must say that he has surpassed James Cameron .By introducing the ' Terminatrix',he has taken the action to a whole new level.Kristanna Loken plays Arnold's ultimate antithesis,and she does a fantastic job.Throughout the film,she maintains the expression of a ruthless,brutal assassin who will never stop until she achieves her objective: to kill John Connor.She looks far more convincing than Robert Patrick did in the previous installment.It is a contributing factor to this film's superiority to the other two of the trilogy.The special effects are incredible:this time, special effects genius Stan Winston has not relied on CGI to get the adrenaline rising,but uses real robots to usher in Judgement Day.The result is a fantastic battle-scene between Arnold and the robots,and you are left thirsting for more. Nick Stahl does his best to look and act like the John Connor as a grown-up,but I don't think he leaves a lasting impression.It is Claire Danes playing Catherine Brewster,Connors' future wife, who takes the cake as far as acting is concerned-what's more,she is the only one except Arnold who fires at the attacking horde of robots,prompting Stahl's remark :'You remind me of my mother !'Danes looks more fit to lead the resistance than Stahl.If there is a fourth installment(and I pray there will be ! ),she should be cast again as Catherine Brewster.I used to think that T2 could never be surpassed,but this film proved me wrong.Outstanding work,Jonathan Mostow !",9,2,3,28 April 2005
Face_Off," An Action Classic That Will Never Lose Its Appeal
","I consider John Woo to be one of the greatest action movie directors in the world,and 'Face/Off' proves just that.However,the element that makes this film one of the most intense and spectacular action movies to ever come from Hollywood is the presence of two tremendously talented actors,both of whom are my favorites.Yes,when you have John Travolta and Nicholas Cage together in a movie ,the results are bound to be over the top. John Travolta plays Sean Archer,a dedicated FBI agent who survived a murder attempt by notorious criminal Castor Troy six years ago. However,tragically his son died instead of him and since than Archer is relentlessly chasing Troy.Nicholas Cage plays Troy,and the film begins with a spectacular chase where we see the sheer intensity generated by both these great actors,and you realize that this is not going to be just another action flick. Troy escapes,but his younger brother Pollux Troy(played by Alessandro Nivola) falls into Archer's hands,along with a floppy that contains the blueprint for a bomb to be detonated in downtown L.A. Pollux refuses to reveal the location of the bomb and then a desperate Archer is given an option that is so spine-chilling that Archer refuses immediately.Realizing soon that he has no other choice,he decides to do what he is asked to-to exchange his face for Troy's, and what's more,to alter his entire physical attributes,so that he can go to the prison where his brother is being kept,and fool him into believing that he is Troy and get the location of the bomb from him.The plan seems to work until the moment Castor realizes what has happened,puts on Archer's face,and sets out for revenge.He fools the FBI,fools Archer's wife and sleeps with her and just when one thinks that this is too much,the real Archer escapes prison and it's payback time. Both Travolta and Cage play their roles perfectly,and they do a fantastic job playing each other too. The rest of the cast simply fades away in comparison,and who cares ? Dominique Swain as Archer's rebellious daughter looks good on screen-but that's about it.Joan Allen as his wife is not too impressive either.Gina Gershon as Troy's lover seems much more real in comparison.John Woo provides the film with a novel and flawless script,and some of the best action sequences ever filmed.This film is an absolute must for any action fan,and definitely the best Woo ever made.",9,112,163,23 July 2005
Quantum of Solace," Another Bond misadventure
","There are legions of moviegoers and critics alike who have hailed Daniel Craig as the best Bond ever and praised the way the Bond series had gone back 'to its roots' , that is ,without the silly comedic touches , without the gadgets,etc. They have showered loads of praise on this new Bond outing too,with which I was sorely disappointed.To me,this movie,as well as its outrageous predecessor 'Casino Royale',has destroyed everything James Bond,the super-spy and savior of the world stood for. I grew up on the 007 films of Roger Moore and Sean Connery,the two all-time best Bonds.And why were they the best? Because they had screen-presence.Connery and Moore just needed to walk into the scene and the whole situation changed.They played the part perfectly,Connery being the tough,ruthless type,and Moore the light-hearted ,yet lethal Bond.I love both of them. Pierce Brosnan too,had the looks and charm to make the audiences believe in him. Daniel Craig possesses neither charm nor any sense of humor whatsoever,and his Bond is more of an assassin than super-spy. I wonder how the producers failed to find anyone more suitable than him. They centered the films around Craig's mediocre abilities,and that is exactly what the films have become - mediocre. No humor,no gadgets,no more lady-killing - Bond actually DOES NOT sleep with the Bond girl in this film ! He just kills,destroys,and that's it. Alas,I never thought Bond movies would come down to this. I went home from the movie theater and watched ' A View to a Kill',which I disliked initially,and found myself enjoying it to the hilt !Sorry,you guys who cooked up this mindless action-movie - you are not worthy of doing what you are doing. Daniel Craig is doing his best in the movie,no doubt- but he can never be the James Bond that we all loved ,just a maniacal version of him.This film proves just that.What is needed is the right actor and the right script,or this series is doomed.",4,14,22,18 November 2008
The Transporter," Pure Unadulterated Action
","I am usually apprehensive about seeing films with relatively unknown faces,because either they are shoddily directed,or woefully low-budget affairs that are quickly forgotten.This movie however proved me wrong completely.Jason Statham plays a retired military man who makes a living by transporting goods in France,and no questions asked about their particulars.Things are hunky-dory until he finds that he is transporting a young Chinese girl in his car,who happens to be the daughter of a crime-lord,illegally bringing in immigrants from Asia.What's more,she is bent on stopping her father and this makes both of them targets of the organization.The film is extremely well made,and the action sequences are deftly handled by Cory Yuen.Jason Statham has the makings of a good action hero in him , and I wouldn't mind seeing more of him.Newcomer Shu Qi is pretty articulate ,but in the end it is the fast-paced action that makes this film a product worth trying,as none of the characters save Statham leaves any impression on the viewer.Pure unadulterated action for a Saturday night.",8,37,59,16 May 2005
Total Recall," Verhoeven+Schwarzenegger= All-time Classic !
","This is one action adventure that will never lose its appeal,and is worth repeat viewings,not only for movie-goers but also movie-makers,who think that great CGI alone can compensate for their inability to come up with story lines more novel than a bunch of ugly monsters trying to have humans for lunch,sometimes above ground or sometimes below water,and sometimes even in far away galaxies.This is a film by the Dutch master Paul Verhoeven,and the storyline is unlike any I have ever seen in a sci-fi movie.The redoubtable Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker in the future who is haunted by horrible dreams of another life on the planet Mars.He then decides to go on a 'virtual' vacation to Mars, courtesy the cybergeeks at a company called Recall who sell such illusions .The trouble begins when they try to implant this' vacation' as a memory into Quaid's brain,triggering the onset of 'total recall',that is,Quaid's complete recalling of his actual memory and identity.He now realizes that his nightmares were actually echoes of a real life he had,and journeys to Mars to find out more .What follows is an adventure of epic proportions, and not for one moment do you feel bored or get the feeling of' hey,I've seen this before !'Paul Verhoeven gives you no room for that. The action is great,the humor is great,and the special effects are breath-taking,if you consider the fact that this was 1990. Schwarzenegger does full justice to the lead role,and frankly,I think his performance here outshines that in 'Terminator 2',where he had to be as rigid and unemotional as possible. Sharon Stone has a brief appearance as his supposed wife,and she is gorgeous in those few moments,though evil. Ronny Cox as villain Cohaagen looks too,feeble ,while Michael Ironside as his henchman does a lot better.All in all,a classic that is a must-watch not only for die-hard Schwarzenegger fans,but for all fans of the sci-fi genre itself.",10,0,2,5 December 2005
Casino Royale," This Film Heralds The End Of The 007 Franchise
","One can only watch this film with utter horror and disbelief. It's an absolute disaster, and the rave reviews it has received show that film critics are among the real villains in our world : these worthless scoundrels denounce a superb actor like Roger Moore, who made seven blockbuster Bond movies ( yes, for your information, you idiots, even ' A View To A Kill ' WAS a commercial success ), and hail this wimp of an actor Daniel Craig as the best Bond since Sean Connery ?Absolute HOGWASH. Go see this film, and then watch 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and ' Thunderball'. Unless you are totally warped, you will realize that this film has completely destroyed Bond, and it will need a really great actor to resurrect him, the greatest spy in the world.And of course,it will take a good screenplay too. In an age where action films are made with more and more sophistication than ever before, this film relies on primitive brutality to get things going.Craig is neither good-looking nor charming- he has the grace of an orang-utan.Those who cast him as Bond were insane.AVOID this overrated piece of trash !",1,22,40,7 September 2007
X2: X-Men United," A great sequel !
","Almost every major Hollywood blockbuster of recent years has had its sequel,and more often than not,the sequel has outperformed the original in terms of both quality and box-office success.This movie is no exception.X2 is a pleasure to watch,right from the beginning to the end.First of all,this film has many new characters.By introducing us to the school for the mutants,Director Brian Singer gives us a colorful cast of teen aged mutant heroes,thus making the film more attractive to the younger audience.As was the case with the first movie,here too it is Hugh Jackman who takes center-stage with his realistic performance.Of course,Halle Berry as Storm and Famke Janssen as Gene are both brilliant.Special mention must be made of Alan Cumming who plays the Nightcrawler.He delivers a credible performance and his character plays a pivotal role in the story too:it is he who leads Storm into Cerebro and it is he who saves the life of Rogue(played by Anna Paquin).Anna Paquin shows a lot of promise-she does her role a lot better than she did in the previous installment.Now to the action.X2 has fantastic special effects,easily outdoing the first film.I especially liked the scene where Magneto(played by Sir Ian Mckellen) breaks out of his plastic prison.Great stuff.this ! I also loved the fight between Hugh Jackman and Kelly Hu-what a pity that this beautiful 'Scorpion King 'leading lady didn't get a bigger role !The big surprise in the movie is when we get to see Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as she really looks-in one,oh so short scene !Makes you wonder why the CGI guys had to be so cruel to her. All things considered,this film is indeed a great sequel -and I wouldn't at all mind if Singer gives us X3.",8,0,0,3 May 2005
