Minority Report," A thinker's movie
","I've read several comments regarding this film alluding to the fact that it's 'too long and complicated'.Complicated?  Yes, in a good way.  The plot twists and turns like a rattlesnake on crack, but not in a way that's hard to follow if you're actually watching the movie.  Put the kids to bed and pop the corn before you put this one in the player, then give it your undivided attention, and you might just discover that the plot isn't so complicated after all.  I had to explain a couple of points to my nine-year-old, but overall, he got it.With that out of the way, let me just say that none of the performances in this movie stand out--it's science fiction, after all--but everyone does a serviceable job and none of the acting stands out as bad.  Of course, I'm a little biased: I'd watch Max Von Sydow read the phone book.
The picture (actually two pictures) this film paints of the future are well-done.  While it's nothing new to show the 'upper crust' living in an elevated city and the 'have-nots' living in the dirty, decaying buildings below, this film does it well.  The futuristic designs are believable enough, and the gritty streets in the 'sprawl' below are nicely crafted.Visually great film, but the story is the number one reason to see it--if you're watching, and if you're thinking, this one's a guaranteed winner.",Null,0,0,26 April 2003
