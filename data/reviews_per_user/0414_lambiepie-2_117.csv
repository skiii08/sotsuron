The Devil's Advocate," Satan passed the Bar, did he go to Harvard or Yale?
","Satan has been portrayed as many things in cinema, but who would think of Satan heading a top New York law firm? This film adaptation of the book does, and it's very entertaining. It shows the slow seduction of a talented, young,  small town lawyer who never lost a case being sent to New York to help a 'big' law firm win their cases. He gets involved in the money, the power and everything ole Satan can throw infront of him and his marriage as a carrot. Reeves plays the title character Kevin Lomax well, and Al Pacino is 'divine' as the head of this law firm who really is 'you-know-who'. Charlize Theron is as cute as a button for in this roll she needs to be, and she delivers on the tough acting side as well. This film contains very adult subject matter, it delivers fine acting performances from all the other actors and actresses as we the audience wonder why is Satan interested in this lawyer, specifically. I recommend viewing this film uncut before the seeing the watered down tv and regular cable versions.",9,2,2,27 January 2003
Saturday Night Fever," The Little Film that Could...and Did
","I was NOT a fan of this film when it came out. I was a teen, and this lifestyle didn't apply to me. But in speaking with many 'twenty' and 'thirty' something New Yorkers at that time, they could fully identify with this film and find little bits and pieces that reflected their own lives as teens.What appealed to me the most in this film was the music and the dance scenes. John Travolta pulled this off well, slickly and is clearly one of the main reasons for looking at this film. I absolutely HATED the dance his character Tony picked for the BIG dance contest, but that is part of the charm this picture had.There is no mistaking now that this film bust discos and disco music wide open in the late 70's. Disco was made to be fun, free, expressive, fashion. And like all things that get over exposed, it died in just a few years to Punk/New Wave of the late 70's and throughout the 80's.Saturday Night Fever produced the second biggest Soundtrack of that decade (Curtis Mayfield's Superfly was the first...) with hit after blinding hit, mostly led by The Bee Gees. This was fun stuff. The movie was okay (I too feel that little Ms. Soap Opera star of that time Karen Lynn takes the film down..), but there IS something in it for everyone from the lead character Tony just trying to find his way and loving to dance, to the 'fat' girl (I did NOT think she was all that fat, but again, that is one of the charms of this film) doing all the wrong things to get noticed, to the friends, the family and how they all intertwine on Saturday Nights to shake it all off and away...if only for a few hours. Disco or not, I think at some point in our youths, we can all identify.",7,2,5,4 February 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Oh yeah, I think Bill needed to be Killed
","This second installment answers my questions from the first and Part 2 is amazing. One of the things I had heard about Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 is that Quentin Tarrintino HAD to put this is two volumes because it was running too long. This was the time when people were sitting though such epics as 'The Lord of the Rings'. I don't think its about the time, I think its about the content. I would have had no problem whatsoever sitting through this as one whole film.Our poor heroine has endured much to get to Mr. Bill and finally this brings you to the showdown between our heroine, Ms. Kiddo and Mr. Bill. What strikes you funny is that Mr. Bill is quite the calm, soft-speaking, guy. Quite the paradox for the continuing calculated things he does when they meet and she starts putting the final pieces of her life together.Quentin Tarrintino is a bit more straightforward with this part of the film, not relying too much on the pulp fiction aspects of unfolding the film - we already saw that in part 1, but more on the final steps of revenge and getting to the last piece of the puzzle for our heroine to make that happen, Bill. It unfolds more like the traditional Martial Arts films, and ends beautifully as a homage to them.Again, one of Tarrintino's best efforts. If you can so, watch Kill Bill as a complete work, Parts 1 and 2 in one sitting..it's worth it.",9,1,2,15 September 2006
Scarface," The 80's and how not to live them...
","Ya know when one looks at this Brian DePalma film today, I'm sure there has been a lot of criticism about how dated it is. Also, about the violence. When I looked at this film on VHS when I was 20, I thought it was ulta-violent and gritty as well. But I didn't get 'it'.A few decades go by and man, how I know how much I didn't get in this film!! This is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30's/40's. How can you improve upon a classic? Ya don't. But you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the 'new immigrants' during the most greed ridden decade, the over indulgent 80's. DePalma, Stone and the gang present an ambitious, disturbing and darn right good film.Yes....Disco was dying and New Wave/Punk were taking over but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida couldn't tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted but how to get it???? To these immigrants, there was only one way to get it in Florida where they were..by having lots of money and to get the money, you had to take over running a drug empire.Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana, the 'little train that could'. What an amazing way to have your lead character look at America: to fight, kill, steal. lie, cheat all to get -- 'the money, the women and the power.'That's what Tony saw as the American dream.He wanted it, he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the 'f' word but what did you expect, Emily Post's finishing school for him and his co-horts? Look at how they CAME to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to. This is the way Tony and his crew chose to 'be all they can be in America.' It was all about the power. Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it..it all its violent, lying, stealing, crooked, thieving glory.The part of the film that personified the 1980's to me, is the money laundering. Tony's crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank. Did those around Tony and his crew care? At the clubs where he spent and drank? Nope. Money was money and with money, you get the power. Tony was living high off the hog. He and his pretty blond American trophy he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer.After Tony Montana's rise to power, he finds out its really crappy up there. He's riddled with doubt, he's drug addicted, he's paranoid, he's surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody take-over, his trophy 80's American blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore, he needs to keep atop of his empire because...he's going down. And down he goes in a horrific violent fashion, but again I ask, what do you expect?This is the quintessential 1980's film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the American Dream...to obsession. It's violent, bloody, overly so..but it drives the point disturbingly home. Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba who landed in Florida in the 80's were anything like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But the showing of how miserable the 1980's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the USA to 'be somebody' and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in America.Makes you wonder -- has anything from then -- been learned today?",10,191,290,22 June 2003
Howl's Moving Castle," Taken Back to being a 'tween' again
","For foreign films, I find that watching a film first in its original language is more insightful than seeing it first in an English language dubbed version. I saw both versions of Hauru no ugoku shiro/Howl's Moving Castle and loved this lovely piece of animation.I've always been a fan of pacific rim animation and was exposed to it at an early age, at its early age. Some of the best characters and stories as a child and pre-teen came from many of these artists, so I am always interested in looking at recent animations and animes. If I were 6 again, I would love the heck out of Howl's Moving castle as I did those pieces of animation and anime. Even now that I am older, I think this is just a wonderful whimsy piece of animation.The images/the animation in this film are remarkable especially: Howl's Moving Castle. You cannot deny how much work was placed into just this piece. Every time it came on screen, it catches your attention. Just wonderful. The story was whimsical and as with many pieces of animation and anime of this kind, you have to suspend your belief and just be taken away by the entertainment. The story is simple: a very shy unconfident girl (Sophie) gets cursed by a vengeful witch who turns her into a 90 year old. She hides in Howl's moving castle until she can find a solution to her problem - hoping that elusive Howl can also find a solution to her problem.Once in Howl's very strange castle, you do keep hearing: 'How can you help me when you can't solve your own problem?' Even when Sophie finds the witch who cast the spell on her the witch relies, 'I can only cast spells, I cannot take them back.' How odd! But that tells you much about this film as well.And then there is Howl. Why is he elusive? What is he trying to do? Is he good or bad, or just trying to escape both to find out exactly who he is? You actually watch Howl's transformations as he himself battles this out. It's quite interesting to see.As in much animation and anime of this kind, nothing is tied up nicely-neatly and there are a few things that make you think about it afterward. But this is a story of sorcery, of change, of strength, of war, of peace and finding enough love within yourself to love others.",9,1,3,27 August 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," If this is comedy, then hold a funeral - comedy is officially dead.
","I am not even about to consider this film in the field of 'gross out comedies' because within that genre, there is a lot of black comedy executed that those who aren't seeking the dark corners of comedy are satired - and you laugh despite yourself - even when no one else is.I didn't laugh ONCE throughout this film. Why? Nothing was humorous - although much was done as personal and religious shots against fellow human beings that some may find humorous. I'm not that big of a fan of laughing at other people's failures (of common sense, ethics and decency) or like to make fun over others failings. This is why 'Borat' did not appeal to me.While I understand that this was a kind of 'Candid Camera' or sorts not with a filmmaker but with an over-drawn out fictional character pulling the on screen jokes and situations to show how people would react, it still didn't deliver the goods for me. The humor was almost always based on some hind of body part - and personally this film went over board on male anatomy as the bunt of jokes. This got old very fast.Then there is the shock value - there was plenty of that. But it wasn't shockingly funny - it was shockingly amateur. I found no satire. I found no black comedy. I found no ribald humor. I found no humorous cultural divide. I found no entertainment value. What I did find was almost two hours of my time wasted that I could have used to do something else that would have kept me entertained - and watching the grass grow would have been included in this scenario.Goshawful film.",1,5,11,13 October 2007
Requiem for a Dream," Excellent look into two sides of one issue
","This is one of those movies I wish I had seen in a theater, but to be honest, I never heard about it. What a mistake. This is a masterpiece of cinema and just one of a few scant examples of a film that more than lives up to its book adaptation.This is a very brutal, very clear cut film regarding drugs and drug addiction from two sides of the fence: the hardcore users/sellers and the unsuspecting prescription addict. It's also about love - unconditional and conditional but the best thing is it tells the tale very straightforwardly. There is no doubt at any time you have no idea what is happening and why the characters are in the positions they are in.This film is not fort the kiddies, but I would not exclude certain teens from sitting down and watching the girt and horror of all of this. The cast of Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn are top rate as well as the supporting casts around them that add more than ambiance but a real dose of human emotion, sexuality and reality.There are parts in this film that will be hard to watch, hard to believe and hard to forget, but that's what makes this film one of the best and should take it's rightful place among the top 50 films of all time.",10,2,4,4 March 2007
Spartacus," I am Spartacus!
","That very scene, that very line -- was what drew me into this film when I was a mere five years old. This is an epic film of a man who grew to be the most unlikely leader...a film that should be viewed over and over and over again for its brilliance, its acting by the great Mr. Douglas, it's direction by Mr. Krubeck, it's locations and story. It's been a LONG time since epic movies have been made, everyone is after the almighty dollar and want things resolved in a hour and twenty minutes. But some films don't deserve these chops and back in the day when we had films such as Lawrence of Arabia, the Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, and Spartacus who cared how long they were, they were brilliant films.I'm writing this in 2004 where we are not seeing films such as Gladiator, The Harry Potter Series, The Lord of The Rings Series, Master and Commander from the Far Side of the World, etc., going over that two hour mark and people actually sitting through them -- enjoying the film experience for the entertainment and epic grand tales of these stories. Just like back in the day with Spartacus. I say, its about time, bring them on. For the rising costs of film to sit in a theater, now having this new wave of movie going experiences like Spartacus is as great way to bring the recent movie going public BACK to these films and to be able to sit down and watch them for the brilliant films they are.Spartacus is one of the top 100 Films of all time.",10,2,5,20 January 2004
Casablanca," Not in the majority -- again.
","Okay...I have watched Casablanca over...and over...and over again thanks to Early afternoon movies on free TV and rained out ball games and the like. I know I'm not going to get a lot of love from my review but...sorry folks, this film does nothing for me.To be fair, I will admit, I don't possess a great affection for movies with love stories. In fact I am probably the only person who didn't cry watching 'Love Story' and my ideal film of unconditional love with overcoming problems is 'Rosemary's Baby'.The greatest American picture of all time? I can't give it my vote. I like 'Gone With the Wind', 'The Wizard of OZ', 'Sunset Blvd.', 'Ben-Hur (the remake)' and a few more. Casablanca is way down the line for me.Okay...boy meets girl again, boy has bar, Sam plays the piano..girl is married to WWII guy...boy lets girl go. I was ready to drop kick her on the plane myself. They BORED me! Now...it could be that I am not really too astute with WWII and this romance being a backdrop of it. Way before my generation and that could be why I am socially retarded on grasping this one. But just like with 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof', I'm just not feeling this film and I think it has been very much overrated.",3,15,38,18 September 2005
A Star Is Born," Another generation, same tale, not much more new.
","I saw all the 'A Star Is Born' before this one, and so if you saw any one of them, you know how it's gonna turn out. This one is no exception. What I liked about this one was seeing actors I haven't seen in film for a while. And I liked seeing Sam Elliot in a role that was a more emotional role that he carried very well. I am sure Lady Gaga fans went gaga over her performance, and well they should as this was for them. For me, not a Gaga fan, it was not moving me so much.For all the Star is Born films, this one was slower than molasses to get to wherever it was they were headed. I was trying to see the 'chemistry' between Cooper and Gaga's characters and ... there was more 'chemistry' between Cooper and Andrew Dice Clay than those two. This one seemed more about family - Cooper and Elliot's brother characters, than a love story which became quite secondary in this.The songs that were part of the focus - eh. But I was not a fan of the songs in A Star is Born from the 1970s either. This film - tries but it is for this generation, and got this generation's star and that is the point. But for my review it was an okay film where it's heart was not in the love story, but the love of family and the 'you know it's coming' end like in all the Star is Born films that preceded it.",5,1,1,9 June 2019
Erin Brockovich," Did I miss something?
","I gotta be honest although I think this film was a nice film, it wasn't spectacular, it wasn't all that great, but it was nice. I say that because I saw it on Cable-TV and not in the movie houses. I would not have PAID to see it in the movie house frankly, it was on the level of many nice films I saw on the Lifetime Cable Networks Made for TV movies. That about sums it up for me. I liked the idea of a low income working single female almost living in a trailer park sticking it to the big corporation, but I've seen it before, over and over, on movies of the week...**yawn**. Julia Roberts' performance was...fine. Nothing to write home to mom about, and even more, why in the things of all that is Holy did she win an Oscar for this? Was the Academy saying this is the best she can do? I doubt that. Anyone could have done this film, Big whoop. A nice film, but nothing more than that.",5,1,5,5 February 2003
As Good as It Gets," Didn't do anything for me
","Jack Nicholson, who is a darn good actor plays Melvin a guy with obsessive compulsive disorder. He meets a waitress played by Helen Hunt to whom he starts caring about and he finally gets involved with his gay neighbor, Played by Greg Kinear who was horribly beaten and robbed when he had to take care of his cute little pampered dog.I didn't much care about any of these characters after a while. The reason why I gave it a 3 is because the only time I was interested and saddened was for the neighbor that got senselessly beaten and robbed. Other than that, it was a soap-opera mess and not something I tend to want to pay for in feature films. The story got bogged down into sentimentality and to deliberately attract Oscar voters with all the unwritten Oscar rules to give it notice.OCD is neither interesting or entertainment worthy in this instance and compound that with the overall meanness of Melvin, it's just not something that would make me care. Helen Hunt's character was depressing as well as annoying - but what turned me off from this film is that this is all something I can run into everyday, so honestly I wouldn't spend my time looking at a film of something I can just look at down my hall way or walk the street daily to see.",3,4,11,10 March 2007
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," A Hollywood Romcom relationship tale that isn't so bad
","It took me years to 'sneak' up on this film. I am not a fan of Judd Apatow films, and that is what kept me away from this one. But I found it by coincidence on cable TV and it was not as bad as I thought it would be.Jason Segel as Peter Bretter does make the film. It is the story of a musician who scores the mood soundtrack for the show his 5-year girlfriend, Sarah Marshall stars in. Kristin Bell does a wonderful job as Sarah, who isn't as 'wonderful' as she appears. She is a real piece of work. She dumps longtime steady Peter for a current popular rock musician Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brand, who she had been seeing for quite some time. Peter has a rough time with the break-up and to try to forget, he ends up in Hawaii where Sarah and Aldous are also 'vacationing'.The film has some neat funny moments overall, especially with the all supporting cast members like of Bill Hader as the stepbrother, and I even liked Johna Hill's little bits in the film as the die-hard fan of Aldous Snow. But the work of Mila Kunis as Rachel, the Hotel customer-service rep, glues the situations that occur together. I also did like Russell Brand as the famous-rock musician as every time I watch it, it's a natural role for him not unlike who he might be in such a situation. Aldous Snow is so fair, so even-keeled in his portrayal, it's sickening and Russel has it down-pat. Sarah, on the other hand, is a not--for both men in her atmosphere so that when what happens to her happens, it's a wonderful payback moment of the film.What I could have done without was the bed scenes of the newly married couple played by Maria Thayer and Jack MacBrayer--even though I like both of the actors. I just saw little need for those scenes but really enjoyed Jack talking about it more than seeing it, as those scenes were much more funnier.This came out to be better than I expected, kinda falls a bit towards the end with the Peter-Sarah-Rachel triangle summary. I find this better to see uncut rather than on regular TV, and the funny moments with some serious ones made me overlook some of the parts I thought dragged it down a bit.",8,1,2,9 September 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A Perfect Blend of ... everything!
","We all know that when a 'sequel' appears, we don't expect much but this is one of those that is quite good. It had the perfect blend of action, romance, locals and CGI that was scary and wonderful at the same time.What you'll like about this is that the characters you knew and loved from the first 'Pirates' are all back - with more demons of their own to face. Of course, the main character - Captain Jack Sparrow is still up to his Pirate-ty ways ad you've gotta love him for it. And just when you think Elizabeth and Turner were going to live happily ever after - a regime change - changes all of that. And so the story goes and it goes so well! The star of this film is a mixture of CGI, action and adventure. As a big horror film fan, I've gotta tell you...all those condemned to Davy Jones' crew are scary as heck. Don't take your kids who get scared at creepy crawly things PG-13 means PG-13 here and there are a lot of creepy crawly things continuing to creep and crawl. I loved it! This film is a second film that sets you up for a third and in leaving the theater all I heard was 'I wanta see the 3rd one now!' This is movie that was a lot of fun and the end was the best.Go see it. Twice!",10,3,8,16 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A film for all to enjoy
","The Summer of 2003 will be known as the 'Summer of Sequels', so when a non-sequel comes out, you're curious. It is also 'the action packed' summer with so many action- type films, they may all start to look alike before labor day, when the Summer Movie fare ends. So what can you do when you've seen 'Finding Nemo', 'The Matrix Reloaded', 'T3', 'Tomb Raider 2', 'Bad Boys 2', etc., etc more than enough times and want to be entertained.You go see this. This has something for everyone. Some may complain it doesn't have ENOUGH of what THEY wish to see in a film, but being that this is geared for a PG audience, don't go in expecting 'R' rated fare.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is a Disney movie, make NO mistake. But it does have a little edge above the traditional Disney 'sappiness'. There's action...but not excessive. There's scares...but not excessive. There's beauty...but not excessive. There's a love story...but not excessive. There is battle...but not excessive. There is blood...but not excessive. There are dirty, scummy Pirates...but not excessive.Which is why this movie is delightful and entertaining. Children 7 to 10 will love this. Children 2 to 6...well you know your kids, if they cringe at images and have nightmares at scary things, don't take them! You go see it FIRST, then make the call for your own child.For 'tweens', they will like this film for the plucky heroine and handsome guys. For 'teens'-- so may they. Young Adults will laugh and enjoy themselves and Parents will be able to sit through a film WITH their children (and you know this summer there aren't too many of those films out there!) and have be entertained. It's that kind of film and in this Summer of Re-runs...very refreshing.Ladies -- will love Johnny Depp, Tweens and Teens will Love Orlando Bloom...and Johnny Depp.Guys will love Ms. Knightley.And what everyone is saying is very important, Johnny Depp steals this film. You'll just love him in this from the first moments he arrives on screen until the end. (The Oscar folks wont nominate him, but you just wish they would -- yes, he's that good here.)Special Effects fans will love the special effects but remember this is NOT a Special Effects film, so don't look for alot of it.Geoffrey Rush is alot of fun and does a great job as the bad Pirate.This film is over 2 hours so be prepared. (For how much they charge for films nowadays, 2 hours will just about give you your money's worth.)So remember, this is a fun 'Pirates' film (finally!!!) with the Disney touch, that the majority of folks can find something in it and really like. I know I did.Go see it especially if you just wanta be entertained and enjoy a film this summer. It will be worth it!",10,0,1,12 July 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A treat for the kids
","As an adult, I found this feature pretty boring. But as I watched it, I had to remember something I forgot - and that was - what it was like to be young. The movies I found intriguing like 'Clash of the Titans' and 'Jason and the Argonauts' didn't do a thing for my parents, but they love me loving it. This is the perfect film for young people as well movie - full of fantasy, wonder and good special effects.This is a film about children who find another world in their a wardrobe closet. This world, is fraught with problems, similar to the 'real world' the children come from. BUt in this world, they are the ones that can control the destiny. Huge wardrobe closets were abundant in my neighborhood and as a child, they seemed so big and had clothes that went on forever in them. Having siblings, it did present the perfect place to play or to get lost. I could have imagined that on the other side of this closet is a whole new world that to survive, needs my brothers and sisters help and as a family we'd have the power to save it. And we'd be the Kings and Queens of it. First, we'd have to be a tighter knit family to get it done, and that message is pretty clear in this film. Nice.Beyond that, there's nothing more of this film. Yes, there are references to 'the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve' as in reference to Adam and Eve from the Christian Bible - but that was really of no consequence to me. With all the things that were running around, you could have named the children 'of anything' and it would have worked. I found no Christian religious beating over the head in this film. To be honest, this film is similar to the 'Harry Potter' series to me, without a lot of the magic references, but with the same talking and human qualities given to wild animals and good vs. evil themes.The White Witch was as mean as a witch would be from your childhood and the children and tweens responded to several instances in this film like...children and tweens would have in those situations. As an adult watching, I would have handled many of those things differently - tougher, more mature - but again, you have to keep in mind, these were children. And they did just fine for the material.A nice film for older children and young tweens who like adventure and fantasy.",7,0,0,24 September 2006
Madagascar," Could Have Been Cuter than Cute
","There were a few very bright moments in this film that many film goers will just love -- but here's the thing...I really feel that this film was rushed to completion. There are a lot of holes that could have been taken care of with just two or three minutes more of film to tie it all in.Then .... there are the jokes they threw in for the adults. Good jokes for adults but the kids didn't get anything out of it. Using adult jokes was a formula that was used for Shrek -- and worked really well because they were crafty and sharp..and also were placed where a child could get something out of it too.Madagascar could have been cuter than cute...and a lot of fun. I took a few children under 8 with me and they kinda liked it - the colors, the music, the voices so it can be good on that level - to take the kids to a show. It has a few things that will keep your interest here and there, but as a total effort, it sadly falls short.",6,6,12,29 May 2005
Spider-Man 2," Spider....man, grows up. Thank You.
","Like many other reviewers, I loved this movie. It has been difficult to get me to sequels but this is one I am glad I have seen.Unlike many of the 'we must do a sequel for kids and box office' films from studios of late, this one really has common sense. It shuts up all of those folks in the audience who don't have an imagination or think of entertainment as entertainment..or even a 'suspension of disbelief' theory. This IS Spiderman...human, conflicted, poor as heck but valant...and someone we can all identify with. And not only could we identify with Spiderman/Peter Parker, the 'villian', Doctor Octopus was not a formula nut case as we have come to know in all summer blockbusters. He too...was very human.As was the rest of the gang. How refreshing. A great accomplishment for cinema.Excellent film, Good job. I can now say, I'm a fan!",10,0,0,14 July 2004
The Irishman," Outstanding Work to an Outsanding Story
","Let me start out by saying when Jimmy Hoffa 'disappeared', I was almost a teen growing up in the tri-state area. The Philadelphia Inquirer, The New York Times, TV & Radio like WWOR, WCAU, WNEW, WFIL, John Facenda, Larry Kane, etc...yeah, the locals and they gave us (with others) the news. And Jimmy Hoffa's 'disappearance'... was all over the news there, but you know what...? I didn't know all of what Jimmy Hoffa was at the time, except for 'missing union leader', and I had to ask my parents. I wasn't born yet in the 50s, and a baby in the 60s... so my parents filled me in about him, the Unions, Kennedy..and Nixon...the alleged underworld connectors, pensions, pardons....etc., etc. As a young almost teen - much of it flew over my head but, my parents were steadfast in their opinions over those years that Hoffa was dead, and it was a mob hit. End of tale for them.As the years went on, the stories in the area of Hoffa being dead or alive were coming out. There was the 'he's in the witness protection program' one, the Government killed him one, the mob killed him one, he moved to Burlington Island and shares it with the Jersey Devil one, and then my personal favorite...he's dead and buried in the Meadowlands.So, I now lived long enough to watch the best of mob films and TV series, etc., and looking back, I think I now could believe any of those stories could relate to the Hoffa mystery, but if there was one to be told in film and who could tell it, I had no doubt it would be Martin Scorsese, and here it is.This is an amazing piece of work from an amazing Director who is telling a 'story', with his touches needed, but making you feel like someone at the end of their life, is telling you a story of a mystery - a story you believe, or you don't. But for me, I can.Scorsese got the best actors in the roles to make this tale believable. Al Pacino rocks as Jimmy Hoffa, as I believe he was and there has to be an Oscar nod there. Robert De Niro, our storyteller, is utterly believable in his role, another Oscar performance there too. The question left for us is -- is 'Mr. Paint Houses' telling real? Did it happen this way? And Joe Pesci...Joe Pesci -- my goodness -- he was phenomenal in this role because he was not playing what you expect, what you may have type-cast him in -- and because of which, he did it soooo well, Oscar nod...and dare I say shoe in win? We'll see.For me, 'The Irishman' took me back to those pre-teen days when this was unfolding and happening and in the news and the papers because when names were mentioned...I was like 'Hey..! I remember that name!' And the hit at the restaurant - I remember that too, it was in the papers. I was remembering - because...I did...forget. And that to me was such an interesting part of this tale. I remembered. However, at the beginning and end of this film it was mentioned how this generation doesn't know about Jimmy Hoffa. True, but think about that statement. It's really a double edge comment, and gets to the heart of the telling of this tale.And Scorsese unfolds this tale of admission. He has always told a story, but this is done in such a manner, it grips you. You question. You're not gonna get the high skilled kill mob count you might expect, as this is a tale about one, told by one you'll either believe...or you continue to chase after the other 'theories' (which they GOTTA be doing because 30 years went by before they could check up on Sheeran's tale, and up to 2018 with the Documentary 'Riddle' we STILL don't know) --, but the time of Hoffa was more than interesting with government, FBI, the unions, crime, Presidents, paid pardons -- and there are parallels in this tale that remind you of what is happening right now -- which makes you wonder - gee, times may not have changed at all, which is why films like this -- are important to remind all of that very same fact.",10,5,12,30 November 2019
Superbad," Super-sad
","I adore gross-out teen comedy flicks. The last 30 years have brought film-goers real classics out of films you may have never thought would be -- and a few duds that tried to bounce off of the others alleging to be instant classics. Superbad falls into the latter category.Superbad will become one of those films to those who looked at it today will look back years from now and say, 'Why did I ever laugh at that?'. The classic teen films were funny then, and are still funny now - that's the difference. Superbad is super-sad, disappointing, dull, lifeless and not very funny or gross. But it is a wanna-be for other wanna-bes.I find the reasoning behind this film to an interest is to have liked the short lived TV program called 'Freaks and Geeks'. I didn't like it, and applauded when it was taken off the air. But it seems as though Judd Apatow has a way of drudging up elements of the failed show and creating the most horrible let down of films that ever were - hence Superbad.There isn't one character in this film that didn't annoy the heck out of me. Especially the leads. Very annoying. The girls and the boys. Not because the leads were two testosterone-laden geeky friends were trying to fit in, get laid and get booze for a party they never would have been invited to in the first place - I mean that alone is a teen-angst comedy waiting to happen. But these teens were retreads upon retreads of other raunchy and drop-dead hilarious teen-angst films who have done the same set up 1000 times better, with more 'pop'..and interest than this. There is more to raunchy than just saying the 'dirty-sexual' words millions of times and 'tee-heeing, nudge-nudge' behind it, or having the a-typical overweight, pseudo-sexual-knowledgeable-punching bag buddy slob over without a context, or the ways the leads tries to buy the liquor (an old set up in itself) - for a bunch of dead-pan female teens you wouldn't care about in the first place - I could go on, but urgh!!! What made the other grossed out teen comedies work is that you COULD identify with one or more characters and those characters were radically different from each other. Here, they were all the same. No difference in any of them whatsoever. That's what made them boring as all get-up. Who cares what these boys did, how they did it -- ? Yawn! For every teen, there is a film that gets next to them and touches what they're going through. If this is for teens today, I now understand the successes of a 'Brittney', a 'Beyonce', a 'Hillary', a 'Lindsay', a 'Kardasian', a 'Paris' et al, etc. Mindless, copycat, two seconds of interest in a 24 hour day dredge. For the other teens, I'm sure they may (grudgingly) agree that the original 'American Pie' is still the film to beat. Superbad is at the bottom, under the pile of dirty laundry.",1,9,26,24 December 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Aw...Come on everybody....!
","I'll admit...I never read the comic, I basically knew who Wolverine and Sabertooth were and based on that it is an ... okay flick.It seemed to try to tie itself to the other three X-Men Flicks out there as not to disrupt what is already on celluloid. Maybe that is why I could follow it more than the fans who know the comic book bell, book and cradle.Hugh Jackman is always nice to see as Wolverine, and Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth was okay as well. Not as bloodthirsty as I believe he could have been though. The first part of the movie really gets your attention - and how Wolverine becomes Wolverine is...interesting. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is doing a fine piece of work here...and then there's Taylor Kitsch as Gambit. I really wanted to know more about Gambit, and what they showed of him was interesting enough, but not in depth enough, as with Deadpool. Focusing on those 4 would have been fine enough of a story...the rest of the folks seemed awfully padded with an awfully padded storyline.And...I was a big fan of Brian Cox (X2) as Stryker - he was cold, chilling kind of man, and this Stryker wasn't quite up to that - or made me believe that years from this story he would turn into the devious/coldness of Brian Cox as Stryker. But again..the movie was so-so. Not as horrid as many are saying, but not as great as it could have been.",7,7,13,3 May 2009
Aquaman," Fantastic Job by everyone
","This was enjoyable entertainment, and a fantastic job done by everyone involved with this film. I can't speak too much on the DC vs. Marvel thing, I always liked Aquaman and saw him on par with Superman and Batman. I found him interesting BECAUSE he was part of the Sea. For years I heard rumors of a feature length film and was happy to finally see this one. It works!What made the film first was the visuals. It's great to see, and I saw it in 3D. I will eat my hat if this team doesn't garner an Oscar nod, they deserve it. Then, there's Jason Momoa as Aquaman, and he fits the bill so much that you can't stop watching him. Aquaman has the difficult feat of being on land and sea, and Jason's portrayal gives you that struggle. And 'that thing' about Aquaman that he can talk to the fish. He can. It was nice to see the beginnings of that.Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Amber Herd, Wilem DaFoe and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II rounds it out great as an ensemble cast. And then there's James Wan, the director who made all this work - the actors, the special effects - what a wonderful triumph, once it got going, I could have watched more.Aquaman is entertaining, it's family oriented and visually brings the undersea world to life.",8,1,5,23 December 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," Welcome to the Summer of 2004 - Popcorn Galore!
","Yes, this is 2004 Summer movie blockbuster popcorn film. It's not bad..but it isn't good either. It's as so-so as they come with a few special moments to keep you entertained and your mind off of other things outside of the theater.I've gotta be honest, I do believe that no one has a control over Nature and no one knows what's going to happen from one moment to the next.  Can this happen? Sure. So can the Sun hurling towards the planet, drying up all of the water and frying everyone to a crisp. (Don't you DARE take that idea from me Roland!!!)But this is quite a speculation and gives you pause to wonder..'what if'. Of course many of us would have done things differently, and of course many of us would do what some did in the film. But besides the fact, I found Dennis Quaid's role not interesting enough for me.  Jake Gyllenhall's role I could take or leave....okay, I'll be honest, the only acting that made me interested was that of the wolves.But that star of the film is the special effects and the chills I got seeing two of my favorite places become 'disaster city'. I live in Los Angeles and the VISUAL of Tornadoes in Hollywood was amazing and I was born and raised in New York City so seeing it freeze over was chilling to say the least. A lot of plot holes, but this was...entertaining. The best part was the 'solution' of where Americans had to go for refuge. Now, that was entertaining! The Day After Tomorrow is a far cry and from 'Independence Day' mind you, but okay if you've got nothing to do and matinee money to spend.",7,0,0,31 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Well...the Special Effects are Top Notch!
","Everyone working on Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End in the Visual, Sound, Cinematic and Special Effects departments should be very proud. This film is by far the best of those categories of the year - so far (and an excellent front runner for all of those Oscar awards by year end). If you see the film for nothing else, that will astound you and more than pay for your price of admission. See it on the big screen.Now the story - here's where my disappointment lied. While many say it tied up loose ends, it did - minimally. The story could have been a bit more tighter meaning a few obviously elongated/scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor to make it flow better.The acting? Everyone in ans surrounding the supporting characters roles did well and in a few cases - more - than the script called for.The featured characters - Chow Yung Fat who is an excellent intense actor was wasted in this script BUT did a heck of a job for what he was given. I can say that about many of the actors here - Geffrey Rush, always fun as Cpt. Barbosa was not as wild as he could have been (okay, I'll say it - to coin a running joke from his first performance, he needed more hats!). The assorted 'gathering' of Pirates was wasted - they could have done more; Bill Nighy was ab fab as Davy Jones but the Calyspo thing was a wasted, wasted, wasted opportunity. That surely could have been better flushed out towards its end (See the old 'Jason and the Argonauts' for details!). Then there is Elizabeth (Kiera) and Will (Orlando). Interesting is all I can determine for I could have done without them and their antics for the most part, but in other pivotal parts, these two were fine.Then...there's Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. I did miss much of him throughout this film and a great deal of him was so 'abstract', it took away from what we all love about the character and his 'wanton, sexy, gypsy, pirate' role.This is an entertaining film, contains much to keep you on the edge of your seat in special effects, thrills and action, especially the last forty minutes which takes you back to what this is all about.This was an almost three hour movie and I had no problem with that - if it all was interesting as the last forty minutes. And for those who stay at the end of the credits? I did. No big deal really. You can stay...or you can or you can wait for the DVD to see it. To me, it was no big deal but sweet.",7,0,2,27 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," One Man CAN make a difference
","Spiderman 3 was not your average Spiderman installment.This movie was laden with some of the best effects, a venom of a villain and something that went a different way than the comic: A lesson in revenge and forgiveness. That's all of what Spiderman 3 is about... and that can be nice.For those who want blood, and guts and hate and action, action, action - you might be disappointed in this film a bit. While there is blood and guts and action, action, action...this film isn't heavily laden with it. Instead it leans more on hate and revenge and what it can do to you if you let it overtake you. Even if you deem yourself ...'popular'.This may not fly with 'die-hard' Spidey fans, or fans of popcorn-summer excitement, but is a great message for the kids. And where I saw this there were TONS of kids aged 5 on up watching. They came in their Spiderman suits, Spiderman masks (I kid you not!) and Spiderman undies, etc. Should they have been there? Well, maybe the right question is: Could you have stopped them from wanting to go? That could be the point and why this installment turned out the way it did.Venom and the Sandman were not as terrifying as they should have been and if it were made with the 'fans' of Spiderman in mind, they would have been. The last 20 minutes or so proves that. Their stories were not too developed but in the theme of this film, this was actually just fine. Sure they could have been better, and sure there could have been fight scene after fight scene with all the glorious blood and action but...this is NOT what this Spidey film was about.You can't please everyone, but this installment seemed directed towards the younger audience while the first two was a bit more for the older teens on up. More flushed out characters, more mature theme and more action within the great special effects.Spiderman 3 is a good film ... with a message.",7,29,57,5 May 2007
Cloverfield," Wanted....better
","The problem I had with Cloverfield was not in the way 'nameless' actors played their parts or even in the way a single camera recorded what was going on - it was in the telling of the tale.I grew up in New York City and no matter how one wants to romanticize it - no one in their right mind, no matter how 'in love' they are with a person would be ABLE to go and get them in a disaster of proportions such as this. It's not about compassion - of course you'd have it, but it is about survival - yours. And New Yorkers know better than anyone that self-preservation is the number one thing on their minds. Especially when Godzilla - or a reasonable fact similar - comes to town.Again, this was NOT a feature film. I could have seen this in the SCI-FI cable channel and have been thoroughly entertained. Especially with it's running time.There is something marketable about the idea of this film, but when you pay upwards $15 to sit down and look at it, you're pretty much ticked. The beginning of the film - the set up - was plausible enough - but it just went on too long for my tastes. And there were a few plot holes left for the viewer that could have easily been worked out more for the suspense of it all, which it was not. Sorry, but I felt that the film was 'going somewhere' - - then the strike happened and they had it end it abruptly to get it to the theaters.They're doing a sequel and for the first time I'm going to write: GOOD. This is one film that needs one, and my fingers are crossed that they don't fall into the same mistakes as before. If not, Cloverfield 2 can be a major chilling, scary, possible classic and a wonderful 'let's pick up where we left off and fill those holes for ya' film. There is potential here.",7,0,0,16 June 2008
Silent Hill," Revenge...film style
","Honestly, I never played the video game Silent Hill so all of the images on screen were pretty new to me. But it does not matter - many of the people inside the theather never played the gfame either, but just like me, were intrigued with the film.Silent Hill's images are remarkable and the sound - where here is a film where the 'sound' is as equally important as the storyline. There are creepy chills and many are are connected to sounds that you hear.Silent Hill is about an adoptive child (Alissa) that has reoccuing nightmares that are so intense that she also sleepwalks out into dangerous places in the night that may ultimately caause her death. In her waking state she is asked about her actions, and she cannot remember. The parents seemed to have taken her to seek help for this but, nothing has helped. In these nightmares she mentions a place, 'Silent Hill' - so when all else fails to help, her mother - against her father's wishes - decides to find the place and take her to it. Upon finding the elusive Silent Hill, she looses her daughter - and sets out to find her all the while discovering the secrets behind 'Silent Hill'. There are secrets that involve her daughter and they aren't very pretty.The biggest occurrence is with 'the darkness' and in watching this - it will provide the most horror and chills of the film. There are people at Silent Hill - religious people in fact - that have created their own horrific world that has hurt those in their group and those around their group and they have eluded their punishment for these deeds for about 30 years. Now it seems, is time for everyone to pay for their actions.What I got from Silent Hill was about a tale of revenge that took over 30 years to accomplish from the hands of folks who used their beliefs to keep their group in check. There are a few things about Silent Hill that may seem off - such as - what is going on with the mother and the police woman? The father and the police head? Is the mother dead or alive? What's with the sirens? But as you watch, and you may have to watch it again (and I will tell you - I saw this in the theater and now on DVD. This is the second review I am writing), those questions are pretty much answered.A few thoughts about the actors and characters: The father, played by Sean Bean, didn't seem to have much to do and I wish they would have flushed his character out a bit. The Mother, The Policewoman (who reminded me of a real,live rendition of many female video characters) were fine to watch as was the supporting female characters - but again, I would have appreciated more character development. The daughter too, was fine. In writing this, all I want to point out is that these characters were there, some more minimally than they should be on film, but I could see where the video game images were more important to develop than the time for the characters.Silent Hill the film, may be like playing Silent Hill, the video game. You will have to watch it again to appreciate how decent a film based on a video game this is. It has good scenes, scary images, chills, horror, and one of the better laid out 'town revenge' plots in film. Plus you have the history of Silent Hill (a real place that is a mining town with fires that are still buring today) as a faint, but interesting backdrop.",7,0,3,22 April 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," I laughed, but now I laugh...until I cry.
","What an excellent film. I did not understand or enjoy this film when I was younger but I would hear folks talk about it throughout my lifetime. I saw it in bits in pieces growing up and it never appealed to me. Then one day after I watched Peter Sellers in 'Being There', and Stanley Krubeck died, I decided to watch Dr. Strangelove, this time all the way through.I laughed...then I cried. The opening sequence is a sexual as they come, and the satire of way the cold war was presented will make you snicker/laugh without you really wanting to. I am a product of 'after the cold war' not quite fully understanding the 'who is superior' ego of the two 'Super powers' of Russia and the United States until it was over and I learned about it in elementary/junior high school history classes, this film finally began to make alot of sense now that I am older.Besides the wonderful Peter Sellers playing multiple rolls, you had the wonderful George C. Scott who had many lines that made you laugh but in 2003, I am really wondering who wrote those lines for him with what we have approaching. Same with Slim Pickens and Sterling Hayden. Looking around the backgrounds the one thing that made me roll over with laughter was the Air Force bases with BIG signs declaring, 'Peace is our Business'. And of course the immortal line from Peter Sellers as George C. Scott was claiming that a Russian Ambass. was taking pictures of the war room and they got into a scuffle. Peter Sellers, as President of the United States tells them: 'Gentlemen, there is no fighting in the war room.'This film depicts a past fear of a bomb that shouldn't have been directed to be shot, and the retaliation of the country being shot of. I say past, since this was 1964. I am writing this in 2003 and the past, has sadly become a fear of the present. A must see brilliant film. One of the 10 best of all time.",10,1,1,2 February 2003
Blade II," A pure view.
","Guillermo del Toro is my new hero. I just began looking at his films and each one of them have elements that make me sit back and go.....'Whoa!' Blade II is no difference. I will be honest. I didn't see Blade I. Wasn't interested. Didn't grab me. I knew of the Comix, I thought Wesley Snipes was a great cast. But for some reason, I didn't get into that one as I had this one. I found it interesting, watchable,gross. I like that kinda thing!
In Blade II we have another evolution of Vampires that actually make sense. Yes, as I get older, I am sick of the traditional Vampire..even those who rip open the neck and expose flesh. Whoopie. Ya seen it once, ya seen it 1,000 times. Here, I see it--and more, and the thing about it is..its very interesting and different.The story was 'alright', but remember I didn't see Blade I. It didn't take Blade I to see and like Blade II which is another plus for this film. The minuses for me was the teeny-tiny possible love interest, I could have done without it. And the new vampire elite squad, I would have liked a tad more character development on them, I found them interesting but I never got to know them. Kris Kristofferson's character seemed like there was more than meets the eye, but went nowhere in this sequel. The twists and turns in Blade II were fine, but could have been much, much sharper developed. I felt it was made into a 'machismo' type film....throw in great martial arts and...wow! No need for that really. The film should have just evolved.The film should have developed more about Blade, his new relationship to his mentor and those evolved vampires vs. the elite vampire crew. Don't get me wrong, 'something' was there, but not enough. Including the fighting. I love a good fight, several of them in fact. But I love Guillermo del Toro, and needed more of his vision. (Is it on the editing floor ready for DVD extra minutes, perhaps?)All in all, Blade II is watchable if you like this kinda genre and I do. Don't let the kids watch, for sure. It's interesting and could be better. In saying this, I know there's probably a Blade III. But even for those like me who never saw Blade I, I found this one -- a little better than 'okay', but not 'spectacular' as it could be for the genre.",8,0,13,6 April 2003
Knocked Up," Overrated Knocking
","I had watched this film on cable-TV a few nights ago and wanted to know what the appeal was. I still haven't a clue. Funny? I didn't laugh - not once. Not even a chuckle. Touching? Only when I had an itch. I didn't think anything could be more overrated, over-hyped and completely meaningless and forgetful than the gosh-awful 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' but I was wrong. 'Knocked up' blows that away for 'why would anyone pay money for this?' I did not find one character likable, believable or interesting. I was totally annoyed at the whining, the over glamorization of 'E! Entertainment Network', the over acting and over simplification of these actors AND their characters and situations.Be honest: This feature film WAS an ABC after-school special you paid $12-$15 to see. And I shouldn't compare ABC Aftershool specials to this mess because many of them were light-years in interest, emotion and entertainment than this one.Knocked up starts out well meaning enough - a career woman gets a promotion, goes out to celebrate and gets totally bombed, has one night casual sex with the ugliest guy in the bar, and later finds herself 'knocked up.' She should be so lucky in this day and time.Then I had to sit through what seemed like hours of immaturity from 20-somethings who made other 20-somethings look like caution-to-the-wind alcoholic idiots in the age of STD's, AIDS and all sorts of other things they haven't even named yet. And after everything, she has a healthy, cute, smiling, bouncy baby and great career. Again, she should be so lucky.A real dud of a film no matter what angle you look at it.",2,3,7,22 May 2008
Malcolm X," One of the top 10 Films of all Time.
","Make NO mistake:It is HARD as heck to do a bio-picture, I don't care WHOM it is about.
To do it as a major release feature film is even harder but Spike Lee pulls this off and it is as great and as epic  -- even moreso -- as any bio film out there.It tells the story of Malcolm Little who becomes Malcom X, one of the most recognizable names of African American and American History of the 60's. What one learns about this man from watching this film is NOT what many perceive, which is why this film is excellent in it's telling.
The story, adapted from Alex Haley's book is a realistic and biting view. It shows a man -- a very strong but conflicted man and his changes, but a man none the less who believed in what he believed in to the dismay of many in a time, not to long ago in America, where the voices and ideas of minorities were stiffled.The very important element of this film of course of the casting of Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. This is one of those rare instances where you forget about 'nice Denzel, the actor' and he becomes that lead character. His Academy Award Nomination for this character was very well placed.Another rare and haunting roll was that of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad played by Al Freeman Jr. on the same Academy Award calibre as Denzel's performance. Spike Lee's direction (what a wonderful 'eye' he has!), Ernest Dickerson's Cinematography, Production Design by Wynn Thomas, the Casting of Robbi Reed-Hume (who won the casting society's award for casting of Malcolm X and rightfully so!) and the acknowledgement of any and everyone to get this film COMPLETED is also what makes this an excellent achievement.Whatever YOU think of Malcolm X is your right. But this film does not make ANY opinions, it just goes through and presents. It's not a pretty life, there are racially charged as well as religiously charged points in this film and as I've written before, it will surprise those who think they knew what Malcolm X was 'all about' and 'who' killed him. It will be HARD to do films like Malcolm X in this day and time, being his 'being' was controversial, but I am glad this one was accomplished by the team that did it.Beautifully made, painstakenly made, top notch performances by all actors and actresses, great production teams, great direction teams, excellent adaptation, excellent music...an excellent film.",10,3,10,2 July 2003
Nacho Libre," Draws you in kinda 'cute'...
","When Nacho Libre first arrived in the theaters, I didn't have a big interest in seeing it. As much as I like Jack Black, I couldn't wrap myself around the marketing campaign enough to get me in the theaters to watch this. But once it came out on DVD, I rented it, watched it twice. Why? Nacho Libre has a 50's/60's type comedy wrapped up in an independent Mexico/Spanish film quality. After repeated viewings, it grows on you and becomes kinda ...cute.What you have is an 'out of the way' orphanage run by Fathers who have become the bottom of the barrel complacent. When one of their orphans now all grown up becoming a 'priest to be' happens to see a wrestler being showered with attention, he visions an opportunity two fold - he himself wishes to be showered with attention, which is not a true path for a priest and also, a way to help the orphanage out of its complacency - with better food & needed transportation to get the orphans on trips. Add in a young, smart, pretty nun who captures the attention of him and another priest, and there begins the conflicts.Jack Black plays the 'preist to be' with higher aspirations to help his orphanage well in a very independent movie type vein. But independent film as it was back in the day from Mexico. The facial expressions of the actors, the pauses, etc. all are reminiscent and nostalgic of these 1950/1960 - even early 70's independent films and Nacho Libre catches them well. The 'independent' wrestling matches too are pretty reminiscent of those times. While there is a bit of violence with the wrestling, there is no 'sex' and the tale unfolds just as it would in family film fare.Why is this film getting mixed reviews? I guess its all in how you see it, and what is attracting you. Obviously this is not a 'drop dead slapstick' Jack Black comedy, but to me a tip of the hat to independent film of old, with some inspiration of real people we would have never know about before behind it.",7,0,0,13 July 2008
Lost in Translation," Snooze Fest
","Here's the thing. I rented the DVD, and about half way through, I got up and did my laundry.This film is talky, chatty, boring. Nothing new here. No racism here either. The Asian culture is what it is, and this gives you an idea of two Americans from two different ages there. I found Scarlett what-her-whoits part even more of the same, nothing spectacular or memorable -- unless your a guy and like pink underwear and constant shots of her behind. Giggle, giggle, dry -- was her acting style. Bill Murray did a good job over all of this  and that's what made me give the film a five out of ten. Sometimes a viewer has to see beyond 'a woman director' and call it as it is. A so-so talky film about two fish outa water that has been done, and re-done and will be done again. This one is watchable -- as long as you have something else to do while its playing.",5,0,1,21 February 2004
Full Metal Jacket," One of the Best War Films out there
","Hello everyone. I chose this day to write my comments on 'Full Metal Jacket' even though I've seen it over 100 times. You see, this morning, my brother, a very proud US Marine died. He didn't have fanfare, he wasn't well known. But one thing he did love was this film. I'm younger than he was, and when this film came out, this was all he talked about. How realistic it was, how well done it was. I didn't see it until two years after its release as it made its way into Select Cable.To be honest, I am not the 'War' films type although there are a select few that go beyond the 'War' theme and get right to the heart of the matter. Full Metal Jacket is one of them. (Spoilers?) To me the film is in two halves: first half is the drafting of these men from all over the USA to be de-humanized, de-sensitized, de-void of all emotions and rained only to kill. It didn't matter what you thought you'd become, you were a killing machine. This was told though a group of recruits in the US Marine Corps on their way to Vietnam. This shows it was not a smooth road for all of them and it shows what happens when a human is pushed beyond...to be trained to kill. The second half of the film follows those who survive and actually go to Vietnam and that isn't a cake walk either. These men had to encounter the enemy that came in many forms and fashions and also had to confront whatever was left in their human sides as well.This is NOT a film for everyone. It is rough. Some parts will be unbelievable to many people out there for they will ask: 'How could we let these young men be treated this way?' We did. We do. We always will. There are superb films out there about the coming home experience and I am glad this film didn't go into that and just did the two halves. The Direction is wonderful. The actors were wonderful, I believed them. It came together nicely.Upon my first viewing of this film, I was shocked. I called my brother, the Marine, and talked with him about this. Many of the things I wrote in this review came from those conversations over the years to put this film into a perspective for me, as someone who was too young to remember the Vietnam war, the draft, but who have had those in her family that had. Talking to my brother, who said, there was much in this film that hit the right tone, the 'inside' of how Sergeants are and how many recruits aren't equip to stand through this, and how their bunkmates react, when I reviewed this film from that moment on I saw it in a whole different and even more upsetting light.An excellent film, one of the top 50 of the 20th Century, on of Stanley Krubeck's best. I must repeat, not for everyone's taste for it is gritty, violent..but maybe if everyone saw this just once, they'd really think about what it really means to send our men and women out to battle and what for.",10,0,1,15 May 2003
Pacific Rim," Sparking memories of childhood...
","Pacific Rim is meant to pay homage to those who grew up around the time of 'the other' ToHo films and ToHo type films entering the market like what Del Toro saw while growing up. It's been decades since these movies got the big screen treatment, and this is a nice re-entry piece decades later that I hope gives the green-light to others as well.What's the story? Well, the story is simpler than most, but this is not a film presented to complicate your mind. It's easy to get, the characters are easy to understand. You'll get the feeling that the filmmakers are give homage to those 'kaiju' films before it, the plot, humorous scientists, those who want to make a buck off of tragedy and monsters. The 'kaiju' were all that one expects them to be: huge, menacing, loud and armed with a few surprises. And so are the man piloted robots.The robots aren't Power Rangers or even Transformers. These Robots, called Jaegers in this film, do not transform into anything. They cannot hide or blend into the scenery. The Jaegers in this film don't throw karate kicks. The Jaegers do not give any moral messages or speeches. They too are big and loud, piloted by humans and are just battle equipment. They are 'fighting machines' against the kaiju coming up from the pacific rim.This is one of those rare films were it doesn't posses your typical movie tack-ons to lure one in (i.e., a star name, a love story, teens, etc.), and that may be one of the film's major downfalls. Audiences may be so used to this so that when its missing, they may think the film is a failure. Not necessarily. It's monsters vs. robots. The only thing I would have liked to have seen are more of the international robots & pilots and their stories, as some were mentioned but had too little screen time for my tastes. Pacific Rim is what the old 'popcorn' movie is all about. It's monsters-from-the-deep matinée genre. It is fun, nice action fight scenes with nods to the models and scales of those old 60s films, and man within robots to save the Earth from getting taken over.",8,3,9,18 July 2013
The Devil Wears Prada," Stinker-roo
","I watched the DVD of this film on Christmas Eve with a bunch of friends. I've heard so much about it and how well it was doing, I couldn't wait to take a look. What a huge disappointment. It was slow, boring and predictable.Sadly, it's becoming difficult to find 'orginality' in film year after year, so when you have something that is the same as something else, you've gotta do the best you can to entertain at $10 plus a ticket, $4.99 a rental. I did have the mind set that I was going to watch a theme that I had seen before. What I did not expect was that I was watching a theme I had seen before from several films that were also 'so-so' to snoozers. It was the re-hashing of already cooked hash that wasn't good when it was new. Maybe it's the 'fashion industry'. Sounds like a good thing to bash since it seems pretty glamorous, treats women like objects and 'walking hangers just to see how the fabric of THEIR design flows' and very cut throat so based on that, it should make an interesting, through provoking story. But from many of the films I've seen try to 'expose' that industry, they've been 'okay' to down right 'boring'. This one is one of the REALLY boring ones.The story is the same: fish outa water girl (Anne Hathaway who's 98% of films she has done is playing this same type of role) gets job with total female tyrant over 40-year old boss (And these women have GOT to look as old as heck, fashionable but OLD - a trick from 'Valley of the Dolls') (Meryl Steep) who treats her like a slave, she gets in with a male gay who 'secretly' helps her dress and 'play the game', she weighs her life against the work life, meets some guy her twice her age and a guy her age (pick any young actor of the moment and throw him in here) continues to question which one to bed/have, realizes she's a slave, tries to overcome tyrant female boss, the industry and herself to realize she's better than what she's doing. Throw in a few fashionatas,(top models, runway showing, magazine covers, camera hungry Eurpean designers people watching can point at and say, 'Isn't that so and so? Wow!' some nice clothes for this time, a somewhat shallow 'I'm being used' ploy and you've got 'The Devil Wears Prada' and 25 other films before it - except you used the name of a top line of fashion design to make it more ... sexy.What also bothered me about this film is that I caught on early that no one spoke over one line sentences and formed words over seven letters long. But ... everybody looked good, the women traded simplistic 'cat fight' snarls, and everyone fit into their stereo-typical part nicely - so I guess that makes it a blockbuster film.'Blockbusters' aren't like as they used to be, I guess. If you're looking for a little depth skip this, if your looking for meaningless time to kill with folks wearing nice clothes and conversing in short cliché sentences with no thought process behind them, and you like knowing what sentence and scene is coming next, this may be your kinda film.",1,32,56,25 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," All I can say is 'Yoda's da man!'
","I had an idea what to expect when going to see this film. It wasn't as epic as a few other Star Wars, but it was a story that needed to be told to fit the other ones together. It was a fun ride at points and I know I will get stoned by all the Star Wars fans for saying this but...I could have done WITHOUT the love story. Yeah, yeah, I know THAT was what was important, but it fell pretty flat to me. If they were going to do it, then it should have been done better. It didn't 'grab' me at all.But to make up for this weak attempt at a very important love connection, the action was to die for. I loved each and every minute of it and the best was YODA! I stood up and clapped in the theater. What surprised me is that I wasn't the only one!Overall, this film was adventurous, it was fun, it was 'Star Wars' and a very important part of the series. Sadly, the all important love story was dry as a chip, but thank goodness the other parts of the film made up for it. But I do recommend this film highly.",9,0,2,28 November 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," I wondered where those monsters came from!
","Amazingly I can remember still being a child and having a closet door that I swore Monsters came out of. When my parents did what they could t convince me there were no monsters in the closet, I knew they ran from the closet to under my bed. What a nice film this was to tap into something we all know about and may have experienced in that wonderful time called 'childhood.'This film was wonderfully animated (yay Pixar!) and wonderfully written for children and adults to love. It was cute, it was fun, it is memorable. The only thing that fell short for me was the very very end, I thought it could have been a bit better, but its not that big of a deal to 'hate' this gem. John Goodman (Sulllivan)and Billy Crystal (Mike) were wonderful voicing the Monsters who work to get the scares from the kids to keep the city going. Then there's Boo's voice, that is adorable. And who could hate Jennifer Tilly's voice? I had no idea that was Steve Buscemi as the slimy 'Randall', it was very good.  Add the late James Coburn voice as the boss and more and you have quite a fun family favorite. I watch this film more than I expected because it was more than I expected. If you've got children, this is a must for your library. Even if you don't, get it, curl up with some popcorn and this will make you remember those times when you were.",9,0,1,6 April 2003
The Godfather: Part II," A rare film and occurance, indeed. Hollywood Take Note.
","This should have NEVER happened.The Godfather part one was a wonderful film in 1972. We got to know the family, the business, the violence.In 1974, Francis Ford Coppola does a sequel. And it's just as brilliant as the original.I'm writing this in 2003 which will definately go down in film history as 'The Year of the Sequels' and not one of those will come near this rare occurance of an epic of a saga. The real term here is 'saga'.I got the feeling watching that 'The Godfather part two' was NOT done for 'sequel's' sake. It was done to complete a story, to answer questions and to get into your mind as to why things turned out for these folks the they way they did. Some things in the Godfather part two you never saw coming. That is the mark of good filmmaking...keeping you on your toes. A few things you KNEW were coming, you may have been upset to see why, but you watch to see HOW it will unfold.The Godfather part 2 gives you history about Vito and at the same time shows you how his youngest son Michael is taking hold. You're interested in both..watching the past and present unfold and realizing HOW their futures entwine. A rare film making experience.And even rarer than that, The Godfather part one is chosen best film of 1972, the Godfather part two is chosen best film of 1974. Both, deservingly so.I got to see The Godfather part 2 as a salute to Francis Ford Coppola on the Los Angeles based 'Z' channel immediately following The Godfather part one. The only other film I sat this long through mesmerized and thrilled with at that time was 'Fanny and Alexander'... and when you're young, its HARD to sit still.The Godfather Part 2 is a rare film indeed, another to include in the top 25 of all time.",10,2,3,2 July 2003
Fargo," Who else can put a quirky true story into focus?
","Fargo got everything it deserved. This was one of the best films of that year, Francis McDormand deserved best actress, William H. Macy deserved a best supporting actor nod, and everyone in this was wonderful, down home and very real! Fargo came along at a time when big-time stories with big budgets made allot of hype, this was an unbelievable story that happened and told in such an unbelievable way...a crime in a small town, shown from that very same perspective. No big names, no big splashes, real type actors doing their job in a real life situation and they ALL were superb. If you haven't seen FARGO, you're missing allot. Great acting, great script, great location, great direction, great cinematography..a 'little film' that showed the bigger films of that year how to do it and do it right.One of the top 100 Films of the 20th Century without a doubt.",10,0,0,16 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I was bored and read the Cliff Notes in Jr. High; how wrong I was!
","How I wish I could have seen THIS film first. I had no interest whatsoever in The Lord of the Rings books. Let's be honest, when its required reading in literature class and the teacher made middle earth seem as dry as a chip, who would have an interest?Well, this film made me have an interest and want to go back and read the books again. This production was lavishly and handsomely done. I was excited, thrilled, scared at points, cheering, laughing and just caught up in the wonder of this production. There isn't ONE character I didn't like, there wasn't ONE moment I wasn't interested. There is so much I can explain about the film, but for my review, I just want to comment on how it effected me as an ex-student assigned to read a book I though was horrid, and seeing it decades later as a wonderful adaptation that I watched over 100 times by now.Here's another film I did NOT go to the movie house to see and yes, I am kicking my own butt for not doing so. I missed a great film on wide screen, and just to let everyone know, I am in line for 'The Two Towers' already.Granted, this will not help my 'C' grade I got when I was assigned to read it back in the day, but I love his film to death. I just bought the expanded DVD, and now I am a Lord of the Rings fan for life!Future LOTR literature teachers, take note! Then make sure your students get to see the film as a companion piece to the books...believe you me, they'll thank you later with plenty of interest.",10,1,1,28 November 2002
The Thing," I LOVE This Film, one of the 25 Best Films of all Time!
","I cannot believe I never added my two cents about this film as yet!This is one of the best films of all time. Many critics and movie-goers alike talk of John Carpenter's 'Halloween' for setting trends and being 'his best work'. Those folks have not seen this version of 'The Thing' because it is right up there with 'Halloween'.John Carpenter's work shines in this film. He took a film that was already made and instead of 're-making' the film, he made the book the first film was based on! Brilliant.The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today 'who goes there?' in that film. This film had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move.I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the screening went wild! I carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought that there was no way on God's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. But by box office receipts, it was a dud because of 'ET, The Extra Terrestrial' and 'Poltergeist' two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.This film was what I, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not little Miss 'big-breasted' scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this film! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless, 'The Thing' was actually feminine! Something to think about!)I saw special effects of that time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. This is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. Today, the Directors wimp out. Today, the Studios wimp out. Too much CGI and not enough belief, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and in a week -- or less  -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. This one stays with ya. That's one of the marks of an excellent film.On many reviews I've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. For films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. This film is NOT for everyone.I find it horrific that they lable this film a 'cult' film. I find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. After John Carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of 'The Thing'.I am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated. Please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally. You'll talk about it for years as well.",10,2,5,12 November 2002
Pitch Black," Why Couldn't this film have been any better?
","This is one of those films that has so much potential that never gets fully developed throughout the film. You have a few darned good actors such as Keith David and Vin Diesel, and a script that isn't sure where it wants to go or what it wants to grow up and be. There is a sequel coming out to this and for the first time, I can say, I am looking forward to the sequel....that is...in hopes that it covers the areas that were so missed in this film: Character development, story development. Now, don't get me wrong, the film wasn't terrible, but you just watch it and at some point you say...'Huh. What happened there? There's gotta be more of an explanation to this.' or 'Why did they resort to this cheap ploy?' I liked the eerie backdrop quality of the film, they should have stayed consistant with that. My complaints were that I saw parts of 'Aliens' parts of 'Mission to Mars'--parts of other sci-fi 'buddy-pick off cast-terrible guy with heart of gold' films that were thrown into this film where there was no need. The production and writing crew should have been stronger (Dan O'Bannon overseeing the script, maybe????) should have let this film be a stand alone onto itself and it would have been...spectacular.",6,0,0,26 April 2003
The Hills Have Eyes," p u
","I cannot express how disappointed in this film I was. I was expecting a nice remake of a classic thriller/horror film and what I saw -- was a mess.The story is simple: A family on some kind of a motel 6 funded vacation gets steered the wrong way where another set of families that was effected by nuclear blasts and decades of radiation and fallout gets to hunt them.Let me point out something nice about the film that does warrant a look: Yes, the best part of the film was the cinematography direction which kept your attention. I must admit, it was very stylish, updated, urgent -- just done very well. But to me, that does not make a complete film.The Acting: not the best.The Horror: Predictable.The Fright: None.The Make-up: Shoddy. Come - On it's 2006! None of those folks had any scare potential! There wasn't any imagination whatsoever with how those folks up there looked. I saw scarier things on that gosh-awful film of Johnny Knocksville's 'The Ringer'.The Story: Well, a good one, it's been done before so... I was seriously hoping the update would help. It didn't.Gore: Benign.Violence: (stay with me here) not violent in a horrific kinda way. I'm tired of the same old/same old - The cute coed getting raped by the guy with three teeth, poor old dad being burned or hung, poor old mom being eaten, etc., etc., etc.The Characters: Well, here we go. I didn't care if any of them lived or died - none of them held my interest for long. That's what made me completely loose interest in this film.To be honest, I kept wondering WHY this film needed to be remade at all. Portfolios so that everyone involved could get another film? Probably.But as far as a fright/horror fest. Not really. This remake could have sat on the shelf a bit longer until someone else came along to resurrect it and scare the pants off of everyone.",5,1,2,2 August 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," One of the Top 10 Films of 2006
","After a year of over-hyped, blockbuster rehashes, there are very few films in 2006 that rose above all of this and were true gems. This is one of them. I hadn't any expectations regarding Little Miss Sunshine - basically because it didn't have the big marketing, big names or big number theater release behind it, but this is a black comedy (really black!) that is just a delight - and darned good.Many here have written about the plot so I wont get into it, but its basically about a little girl who wants to enter a beauty pageant. You see those around her, eccentric, mean and very fallible family members and friends. This is also a film about family. No Hollywood ending here, actually pretty real as real can get on film. Also what's real is the little girl, I just loved her because she WAS a little girl and when you see this film that's one of the main things that stuck in my head, especially after she gets to the beauty pageant.Warm, remarkable, slice of Americana and the illusions of wishes, fame, and trying with all of your heart for a positive outcome in a negative, every man for themselves world. A must see film.",9,3,6,25 December 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Popcorn Movie...nothing more, nothing less
","It seems like the problem with a lot of reviews is that many are forgetting this series is called: 'The Terminator', and that is what is continuing to happen in Terminator 3.'John Connor' is looking to be terminated by the machines who rule existence in the future -- come heck or high water. That is THEIR plan which is the whole point of these films. Send a machine, or machines, to kill John Connor or to possibly SAVE John Connor. Once you get that in your brain, nothing else matters. What we are seeing is what occurs in and around John's life as this happens and why these machines NEED for it to happen. Remember that, and you may -- or may not -- enjoy, Terminator 3.With that in mind, who cares if Arnold is there or not. He's a lovely 'familiar' addition, but by no means the make or break all of the central idea. This franchise CAN go on without him. Arnold's character (if you want to call it that) is a TYPE of machine model that will either save or destroy John Connor. Depends on who's programming what at which time...This terminator MODEL has the same face. Arnold's. Do not be surprised if the next Terminator movie (God Forbid, hut hey, money is money) has several Arnolds in it and ya don't know which is 'good' or 'bad'. There are other advanced models sent as we now are aware such as...the 'Robert Patrick' model and this Barbie doll from a Rodeo drive window. (As a resident of Beverly Hills I take offense, she should have been at least 53 years old, and should have came out of a plastic surgeon's chair as she was getting rhinoplasty/breast augmentation or a tummy tuck. Now that would have been a fun film!)There will be many more sent, etc...but don't forget the point --- that the Arnold model terminator is a 'dependable', 'stronger' model even if its older than the others send to do the job of terminating John Connor at various ages and stages in the game.Heck yes, I miss James Cameron's work, but I would have been disappointed if he went into this mire of Hollywood Franchise Business at this stage in his career. Same with Linda Hamilton. Onwards and upwards, I always say.Mr. Mostow has HIS chance now and he's done exactly what was needed of him. Studio execs are applauding. To produce an adolescent testosterone driven Holiday release popcorn movie heavy on explosions, action and pyrotechnics and thin on plot, story and series continuity.MAJOR Terminator fans will be scratching their heads at a lot of this installment, younger viewers will be thrilled and give the film praises because it's all the old Hollywood rape your pockets for the summer shuffle and jive of 'smoke and mirrors action'. On the other hand, the ending (like everyone else I wont give away) but for me, well worth the price I paid to get in this weekend to see it (and that was on a matinÃ©e.)Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (Which by the way, is the best title since 'South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut') is nothing more than some popcorn selling 'entertainment' to kill a long drawn out holiday weekend and another, installment in 'the Life of John Connor, human savior.'",3,0,0,5 July 2003
American Beauty," American Beauty surprised me.....
","When American Beauty was released in 1999, I hadn't any initial desire to run and see it. The trailers to the movie did not make me WANT to see it. What DID get me in the theater was 'word of mouth'. Once I saw it, I told everyone I could and they went to see it -- and I am so glad we all did. What a fresh change for a film at the time! This is a film about middle aged adults, being a teen, suburbia, ideals and what goes on beyond those pretty houses in those pretty areas with those pretty schools. It's not a popcorn movie, there aren't any car chases - in other words, this is a film that tells a story. And the story isn't a pretty one although at first it may seem to be. This film is one of those 'good' films about adults that actually lets you get 'on the inside', and you see whats happening from several perspectives, including the teens who are in their lives. Not everything is what it appears to be, not everything that looks alright is beautiful and to quote Basquait 'you can find beauty even in the most wretched.' This is a wonderful film that deserved every accolade it received. It may even surprise you too.",10,0,1,15 January 2005
Disturbia," Something Nice for the High School Teens
","This is one of those films that happens to be a great film for the 'teens of the time' - done well, done intelligently, a tale they can wrap their finger around even though it's a story that has been done many times before their birth. But...here... the story hits the mark for that audience, and that's not a bad thing.Here you have the tale of a teen that unfortunately gets sentenced to what should be a good summer, but three months of 'house arrest' due to unfortunate circumstances. Those circumstances are things every teen today can identify wholeheartedly with. But where the stroke of intelligence comes in is when his mother takes away all of his technological advances that would make the three months whiz by - no i-tunes, no Apple access, no online games to communicate outside with others, NO TV!!!!...etc. Instead he has to find something else to monopolize his house arrest time and he does - regular life outside of the windows of his house..and he finds interesting neighborhood tales. But he stumbles on one that is downright horrifying. With his new 'hottie' female neighbor and his faithful best friend, they piece together what they see and what they investigate to find that their horror is real.Again, very nicely done for the late teen/early adult audience with enough thrills to keep you interested - and a fine homage to 'rear window' completely updated and plausible. Sir Alfred would indeed smile at this film.",8,0,1,19 August 2007
Van Helsing," I liked it!
","Hello everyone..Ya know, I had one of those weeks at my job...the kind where it was 'do or die' and no matter how hard you would try...you knew when the lay-off slip comes along it would be you?Well, it wasn't me and I was over reacting. Like I feel many (not all!)who are writing adversely about this film is doing.  You see, after a week like that, I needed something to take my mind off that world. To relax, to unwind, to enjoy. I got to see Van Helsing and it did the trick. I laughed, I was entertained, I forgot about the seriousness of the world and enjoyed mindless, fun entertainment for a few hours. Does anybody know how rare that is these days? Some folks wish to be a 'shock-jock' type of critic or seem to want to look for so much in nothing -- and sometimes, you just need to let your mind go, have an imagination and be open. Van Helsing is not a Documentary, it's not an independent film, its not an art house film. This is one of those films that just wants you to have a good time.I liked this film very much, I liked the CGI - to a point (okay, I'm a fan of Lon Chaney and Lon Chaney Jr.) and I liked Hugh. I've enjoyed Kevin O'Connor of late and knew that was him as Igor..well, he had the best line in the film that just cracked me up. The 'brides' made ALL the guys from 15 to 21 get REALLY interested in the film...as did the character Anna. (Isn't that what it's about these days?!) And the Monk..well..let me just say, bravo to the actor for making a 'departure' from his last known famous role. He did well. And it was kinda..nice..seeing the old Universal creatures on screen in THIS the new millenium, even though I loved them better in the old films, but WHO is looking at the old films? Well, this is one of those movies that may MAKE newer moviegoers do that. At least, I hope so.Entertaining, fun, visually interesting. Was worth my matinee money.  For those who want more 'seriousness' in their plots, please go to an art house film. (But it's my guess that those who have something to say against this film, wouldn't be caught dead going into an art house to see a 'serious' film.)So lighten up. Clear your mind, go see Van Helsing just to enjoy yourself in mindless entertainment! Life right now is too short and too serious for real to argue over something so imaginative.",6,0,0,8 May 2004
Dreamgirls," See it, and make up your own mind.
","Before anyone should make any comment about anything, they should have some experience with it. With 'Dreamgirls', my comment is for YOU to go see it and make up your own mind based on your own taste. These comments just another view in helping you to decide. My advice: See it. On the BIG screen.The character 'Effie' says this in the film: 'You pick her to be out front only because she looks good? I have the talent! I can sing! Why do that?' This is the entertainment industry, and 'Dreamgirls' gives you a look. Even within its own cast.The production quality is the best on film for a musical this year. The ensemble cast is one of the best ensemble casts of this year. If you loved 'Dreamgirls' on Broadway 25 years ago, you'll tip your hat to what a wonderful film and film adaption production this is. It's as faithful to the production as possible with a few changes, and a few additions, but because this is 'film' and not 'stage', you can sit back and enjoy.As far as the performances: Jennifer Hudson as 'Effie' steals the film. Talented as anything, but dismissed for her looks and her strength. You miss her when she is not on screen, you feel for her when she is. This part is a star making role and Jennifer Hudson is a star in the role. It's almost a shame to call her role 'supporting actress', she's just that good and attention grabbing.Anika Noni Rose as 'Lorrell' is the surprise here. She is simply adorable! You watch her mature right before your eyes, and mature she does. She fits perfect as a 'supporting actress' and does a darn good job of her role. On screen, you are interested in her, wonder about her and is humored by her.Beyonce Knowles has the hardest role of the film - 'Deena' - one that everyone will eventually loathe at some point and because of which, she'll fade away in the role. In watching Beyonce you cannot escape her beauty, how great she appears in costumes and how she can carry a tune -how she is supposed to be a lead -- but her role becomes second banana almost immediately to the stronger role of 'Effie' and Jennifer Husdon nailing it. In watching Beyonce get a solo song, 'Listen', it was like watching a performance that was thrown in as if to say, 'Look at me, I can sing and be heartfelt too!'. Yes, Beyonce can. But it was NOWHERE near the showstopper tune 'Effie' has and unfortunately 'Listen' me feel as if there WAS a singing competition going on between Beyonce and Jennifer - not 'Deena' and 'Effie'. Jennifer won. But this is NOT to say Beyonce Knowles doesn't have an acting future and she doesn't have acting talent and that she was horrid in this role. On the contrary, Beyonce Knowles was perfect as Deena.The surprise to me was Eddie Murphy...Eddie Murphy...EDDIE MURPHY(!) as 'James Thunder Early'. Those that have followed Eddie's career from the beginning will be able to see that this is the role he has been working towards - and he knocks it out. What another perfect cast. Those that know of Eddie's later performances here and there will find much to nit pick about, but there is no mistaking his exemplary performance as a star that rises and falls with all of its joys and pitfalls.Danny Glover was also cast wonderfully in the quiet role as the beaten music manager 'Marty Madison'. It is a quiet role for it interweaves through so many lives. Jamie Foxx as 'Curtis Taylor, Jr.' was done well although I thought there was something more 'supporting' than 'leading' about his character. Keith Robinson as 'C.C. White' is an important role that gets lost somewhere in transition - maybe because they waited until late in the film to expose his background.The plot has been told much here: 'Dreamgirls' is loosely based on the make-up of The Supremes, but it has so much more make ups of so many other African American artists of that time - Motown based or NOT ... and it gives you a look into the history of music - of the racial differences of crossovers and payola of the 60's and to the 70's during turbulent times and to free wheeling 'disco'. Each character has a bit of ALL of these musicians mixed in, and this production isn't too shy with being forward about influences of many.You don't have to like musicals to like this, but it helps. You don't have to like girl groups and music cat fights of the 60's and music/history of that time to like this film, but it helps. 'Dreamgirls' is lively, dramatic, musical, touching, a wonderful ensemble of actors and musicians, gorgeously produced, will have you clapping and yes, could very well be 'Best Picture' front runner at the Oscar race. A very enjoyable experience.",6,7,9,6 January 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Gosh awful excuse for a 'comedy'
","I loved the poster. And that's the ONLY thing I liked about this hapless farce. When I saw the billboards and posters, it was the funniest thing I've ever seen so I was looking forward to this film. Just like with 'Wedding Crashers' there is too much hype to what is an non-funny film.The premise is funny: a 40-something year old man who works at a 'Best Buy' knock-off shop never had premarital sex. How can that be in this day and time? That's what his friends want to know and try to fix him up with every woman they can find in an 'easy' situation think of doing to help him -- but he just doesn't connect with anyone until he meets the woman who works across the street. He's clumsy around her, goofy - and they fall in love.So why is this film awful in this reviewer's view? Well, the actors were not comedic - I never laughed - ONCE. Very stiff, very unfunny. I found that with most of the movie, the actors played everything out...pathetically. Instead of laughing with the group, I felt sorry for them all. Somber and displaced looking actors, Steve Carrell being the most somber trying to be 'funny'. You would think being that a virgin the character would be a bit more nervous, but he was just CREEPY. Not 'funny' creepy, not even 40 year old virgin creepy - just creepy. Every time I see Paul Rudd in a film, I cringe for I'm not completely convinced that he can BE comedic - he can be a smart-Aleck, and to some that can mean funny, but not to me. Then there is Catherine Keener - she just does not move me in any film I've seen her in, lately. She seems as though she may be waiting for lines, nervous about delivering lines, surprised when she gives most lines - but regardless when she talks, they are just lines to me. I didn't feel her character here.There could have been many other hilarious ways to go with this film, but they all would entail better writers and better actors. If this is what 'comedy' is now...start giving it a wake.",1,2,6,20 January 2007
Ratatouille," Refreshing....Attractive....Touching...A wonderful film!
","Ah, to be an apprentice at Disney --- and to come full circle. Brad Bird is that person and for all of those who are out there that think the odds are against them in such a dog-eat-dog world of entertainment, just mapping Brad Bird's career and his latest installment of Ratatouille should make you get up and not allow anyone to stop you from what you can do! It doesn't matter how old you are, Ratatouille is the film you have to see this summer. It is cute, funny, refreshing...in this summer of big money sequels. And to coin a key scene from this movie -- watching Ratatouille took ME back to a time when I was six or seven years old watching Walt Disney Films on TV when Walt oversaw the studio. Ratatouille is a film done in the tradition of the Walt Disney Company -a well thought out, family film with hope, an unlikely hero, fun and heart. Ratatouille is right up there with the Walt Disney legacy films. Bravo.Ratatouille's story is a story of prejudice, triumph and cheer about a rat with a talent in his keen sense of smell and in gourmet cooking, and a big dream and he gets lucky, and even though you might have a few reservations about 'rats' in a kitchen (I did!), that's what makes this film so wonderful - it'll bring your 'imagination' and 'fantasy' back - and not the reality of 'hey, there are disease ridden RATS in the kitchen!' Disney Animation was always on the forefront of that. Remember those days...those carefree, childhood, imaginative days? No? Then go see this, you'll be happily reminded.Threre isn't enough praise to give to the animators at PIXAR here as well, the characters are well developed and drawn out and they have captured Paris wonderfully and puts you right there. You cheer and clap at this film but best of all, you laugh - with you and yours. This IS a family movie indeed that doesn't hit you over the head with that notion. And that's a good thing. Go see this....it's a lot of fun!",10,3,5,1 July 2007
The Exorcist," The Best Film ever - Horror, Religion and the Faith in it all.
","Ah, how times have changed.I saw this movie when it was first released widely in 1974. Back then in Hollywood Films, children didn't SAY or mouth the words the possessed Regan spews,(today many children say these words and more on TV and in film, so it's not so shocking) Priests were looked at as wise-old religious confidants, and it was rare to see a 'celebrity' single Hollywood Actress raising a child to boot! Challenging these norms is what makes 'The Exorcist' film scary, the materialization of a demon/demons taking over a body of a pre-adolescent child makes it horrific and the real scriptures from a Christian Holy Book being conveyed with such force with the scary (again, for its time) special effects in a mainstream film made it spectacular.Before 'The Exorcist', the epic Hollywood mainstream religious films with scripture and subsequent lessons were 'Ben Hur' and 'The Ten Commandments', 'Samson and Delilah', 'The Robe'. Uplifting, true. But here was the start of, as many religious people put it, 'Satan getting more box-office than Jesus'. And not only was watching this child becoming slowly possessed was a problem, but so was watching the lives of those around here who would ultimately come together for not a happy ending.Make no mistake, this was a first in mainstream Hollywood film history. You had a man of the cloth who--sure--was questioning his faith, but you also saw he was as human as we all are. This Priest had problems with his family, problems with his faith, problems with how he was educated!! Wha--??!!You had an 'working actress' trying to raise her child and be a good, attentive single mother at the same time.You had the hero of the film, an old Priest who retired to archaeological digs which in his young priesthood ago had a battle with a demonic spirit in Africa that he thought he ran off the face of the earth only to realize that it had re-located to a little girl's body.Then, you had a little girl who had problems of her own. She's growing up with no one to relate to, for her parents divorced, her father never continued a relationship with her, she's aware that her mother is having a 'relationship' with the director of her film. She's changing... and the best solution they can come up with is grueling, seemingly barbaric test after test on her body and mind which would probably take its toll on anyone young or old.You put all this together with excellent direction, and an excellent script adaptation from its book, layers of STORY and character development and you have one of the best films of all time, 'The Exorcist'.Now, some 30 years later, one would consider 'scary' and 'horror' in film only so if it contained a lot of blood and guts and computer enhanced special effects. For its time, The Exorcist did it all by hand and it was spectacular. The Special Effects may look 'rinky-dink' by todays standards, but its the religious inferences and WHY it was occurring on top of the effects that was horrific. I mean its one thing to see a child floating above a bed, but why she is, is what scares you.I do feel the more connected you are in the Christian Faith, is what may make this film horrific than most. Horrific good or Horrific bad. You have several battles here, you as a film goer pick and chose which one or none you care to believe but the bottom line is for all that this film presents, it does it well, provokes discussion and thought and I still haven't seen a film to match what 'The Exorcist' has.One of the top 5 Films of all time.",10,3,5,5 January 2003
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A Prequel to a Prequel
","I'll admit, I watched the film a few times before rendering a vote, but I found it to be a decent entry in the 'world' of Harry Potter. I am one that hasn't read the books but saw every movie and became a decent fan of it that way. If you've seen the films and paid attention to little details, 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them' actually ties in pretty well. The problem is, many will miss that.This movie has a big cast, and several stories running through it. Some I liked, some I didn't. The story I could do without was the election one (with Jon Voight), it seemed to weigh the story down. I understand it was meant to expose an element, but it wasn't that necessary to do so in such a convoluted way. If they just nixed this all and took a few sentences to explain it instead, it would have saved 20 minutes of the film.I liked the story of Jacob (the aspiring baker) and how he happened upon Newt (played by Eddie Redmayne) and Porpentina (played by Katherine Waterston) and Queenie (played by Alison Sudol) and those 'Fantastic Beasts' - and 'where to find them'. The 'beasts' were okay, some very colorful, some not really fully realized as I would have liked to see them.Creedence (played by Ezra Miller) was a bit of a letdown for me -- maybe because of the unveiling wasn't 'dark' enough of a creature for me, but a CGI puff of smoke and even before that, I was trying to get a feel for the character and was all over the place on it. I've seen scarier more threatening ones in PG movies and I think this movie needed a better one. And Creedence's story overall needed to be better fleshed out.The story that confuses folks the most is the one of Percival (played by Collin Farrell). This is why I watched the film a few times before it dawned on me that this is what will connect it to the franchise. When I finally 'got it' was when I thought this was a good prequel to a prequel.The 'Percival' story just got really bogged down and drawn out to get to the point - and I would think the die-hard Harry Potter fans got it immediately --in the end, and that was the unfortunate part. I would have liked more clues THROUGHOUT the film leading to the reveal at the end. Why? Because of those somewhat Harry Potter fans like me, it took a minute to 'get' -- but after I realized what was going on, I am looking forward to the next installment. What is it, I think..? Well (And warning -- here maybe a BIG SPOILER!!!)'Percival' wasn't really 'Percival' but ... the dark arts master Gilbert Grindenwald! Wow!!! If you're now still wondering who Grindenwald is, then I can understand why the whole thing is still confusing. However, what is important to know is that Grindenwald and eventual Hogwarts Professor Dumbledore have a huge...and I mean HUGE ... history before Harry Potter. This is an exciting prospect.I think this was an attempt to bring the Grindenwald/Dumbledore story into the Harry Potter franchise/world. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them', introduced you to those that will be important to Harry Potter's world, but this now is their World. Don't discount this film. There are so many hints to what is to come. But ya gotta go through this first. And don't miss the'subtle' but interesting barb of the two competing best Wizardry Schools, one in North America, Ilvermorny and Hogwarts! Two Wizardry Schools?!?!? Wow! For me, this film is getting to some very excellent upcoming stories was longer and got convoluted than need be to get to (or understand for some) and made what could have been a really great film entry into the next side of the Harry Potter world, a longer one than need be.",8,0,1,21 September 2017
The Butterfly Effect," Coulda Been a Blockbuster
","The idea of this film was a great one...of altering ones past and seeing the repercussions of such actions if one could...and this film has a few parts in it that will make you believe that this could of been a 'great' film, but it turns out to be just a so-so film. And to be honest, I keep wondering why.First I thought it might be the star, Ashton Kutcher. I could see glimpses of good acting, and many chances missed for great acting. It might not be Ashton alone -- maybe it could be that he didn't posses the maturity to play the role, or he was directed to portray maturity in parts that needed it. Ashton is one of those actors that in about 10 years, will have a few roles where everyone will be shaking their heads and saying, 'Gee, I didn't know he was that great of an actor'. I can see that he will be, and maybe this is one of those films that could have waited until then.But you cannot overlook Amy Smart. She is what absolutely makes this film watchable. Her performances are outstanding. But if I take my '10 year' rule for Ashton and away from Amy -- she would have never gotten this role and we would have missed out on seeing a good actress work. So in lies the dilemma.'The Butterfly Effect' has likable performances in which many actors had a chance to 'shine' -- but at one point or another don't quite go all the way with it. Why? Is it the script? The direction? The Editing? The film financing? The ratings board? A combination? WHAT!?!?!Honestly, I see this film ripe for a remake in the year 2025 and everyone will love it beyond belief while many of us will remark how THIS version had its moments.",7,0,5,9 January 2005
No Country for Old Men," A film that leaves an impression
","No Country for Old Men by the Cohen Brothers is one of the best films of 2007 hands-down. This book adaptation was made for these two brothers to do, and I am awfully glad they did. All of the Cohen's styling were here, and that's what made this film the most horrific, 'down-home', violent, film of the year.Like everyone else, the performance of Javier Bardem was extraordinary - scary, evil, horrific and just plain old gives you the chills like no other psychopathic murderer in film. Josh Brolin's was wonderful as the character of Llewellen finding the money also presents one with a dilemma - 'what would you do if you found 2 million in cash?'. But after this film I know exactly what I would have done, and that was leave the money where it was! And finally, Tommy Lee Jones as the Sheriff is also worth much note and accolades for his portrayal was exemplary. Many folks felt robbed of 'the ending' but let me say, I found it appropriate and...artistic. That's what I loved about this film. The Cohen's could have taken the 'easy way out' at the end, but instead, they presented us with a different take - one that really works and leaves you discussing the film even after the credits start to roll.No Country for Old Men had me doing something I rarely do at films: Talk to the screen. I was really scared for some characters, afraid for others and on the edge of my seat - many times. This was a truly good film.",10,1,6,15 March 2008
The Favourite," Not what I thought because I was led to think of another
","I too couldn't wait to see this film. Now that I've seen it, I can't have un-seen it.I like quirky period pieces. The comedic ones are hard to do, and this started out very funny. Then it took a turn that could have been more funny, quirky, satiric and turned into quite the mess. Many people say this is the work of the director, Lanthimos. Maybe, but the acts of comedy, pathos, ingenuity were there are points, but not enough. I do not think that was all the fault of the director entirely, the script had much to do with it, as did other things.The man characters were fascinating, and watching another 'tables turn ambition film featuring women' was quite nice, especially with Stone and Weisz at the helm of the 18th Century's take on it, and Colman putting forth a great performance in it all as the (bipolar?) Queen Anne. That wasn't so bad, just notWhat bothered me is that I kept thinking from time to time while watching, 'What if ... Ken Russell did this film'?' For me, there in lies the criticism. Ken Russell would have done this as this work reminds me of a film much trying to be similar the work of his.This film is not dreadfully horrible, but it's not what it could have all totally been towards brilliance either. However, it did make me miss Ken Russell and his type of touch to even it all out as it looks like this is what it was trying to go for.",5,1,5,4 August 2019
City of God," Excellent
","Here is another great entry into the world of cinema - a film that contains a compelling story, compelling actors, great camera work and it makes you think and speak of it long after you've viewed it.City of God is an excellent film. It is disturbing for many - especially those who need to take a look outside of America and see the parallels of the problems plaguing children and low income communities in the 60's and 70's. But here is the 'rub' - why do two children who come from the same place turn out SO differently? One child's aspirations to become a professional photographer against the other who becomes a product of the environment? I believe this film, City of God, sets out to answer that. These situations are not indicative of Brazil or America or ... ??? And if one pays close attention, there are many lessons in this for everyone all over the world to grasp.",10,1,4,23 December 2004
Avengers: Infinity War," Excting, heartbreaking and -- makes you think that even Heroes can't last forever.
","Yes, this is a Marvel Superhero Movie. Many of the fan favorites are here. They are all doing what they are good at doing with their skill sets used for protecting the Universe. There are the fights, then the battle. Then they lose. They lose big. What? Yep. Why? Logically, how can they not? Logically, And that is the beauty of what is presented here. A bold move for beloved characters but it works.These Super Hero characters are faced to confront the inevitable. How can they combat an egotistical maniac with power who thinks he knows what is good for the Universe as he sees it --and knows if he can capture the five stones that (basically) represent a corner of each existence to do so? Nothing will stop him. He will destroy family, friends, Nations, Worlds to get what he wants. And gets it. That..is Thanos. (What..? Who'd you think I was referring to? If so, then maybe that's why the film irritates some, and saddens others. It takes you from fiction to a possible reality and that makes you..think).No plot? Really, it's the oldest plot in the world and presented here it is entertaining, but heartbreaking. Heroes win, don't they? Evil gets defeated, doesn't it within 2 1/2 hours with all your favorite Marvel Superheros at battle? This film starts with horror, and ends with it too. That is the beauty of this entry. Fans will walk away musing as things are left open (not unsolved). Fans also know that Thanos will not magically disappear and everything will turn out perfect. It didn't. It won't. Thanos is the part of the Marvel Universe you'd never expect to see in an entertainment film, but had to. And now is a good a time as any to do so.Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Vision, Guardians of the Galaxy and all the characters that surround them are all here to battle to save the Universe. Universe. Big place. It was great to see them all on the screen, and as I've already mentioned, doing what they do best. The BEST part of it for me is seeing them act as teams to do so. But, they are battling a more than formidable entity no matter how much teamwork they try to overcome it.Hope? Well, that I won't spoil for you -- but let me tell ya, the Marvel Universe is HUGE, and this film only touches the surface of what else can be introduced. And one part of the MCU I've been waiting for, is strongly hinted to arrive, and I cannot be more happier to see it (in the next installment, I'd bet big, yes!). Will there be a happier ending there, maybe? Um, not sure. But that what makes this a great film -more than just a summer blockbuster, more than just a bunch of Super Heroes in the screen mulling around the Universe. It actually makes you think.",10,1,3,26 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A...'what if' ... done very well
","Answer this quick: Who is faster - Superman or the Flash?How about this one: Who would win in a fight, Robin or Kato from The Green Hornet?Or this: Could Muhammad Ali beat Mike Tyson?These are those nagging question for some that when asked, everyone has a view on. And there is really no right or wrong answer as there is passion on both sides of these questions.This...is another take on the same concept, and it works very well. Quentin Tarantino takes a question that has been floating around for decades and gives us a look into 'what if' or...as every fairy tale begins, 'Once Upon A Time'.We get taken back to the 50s and 60s and how Hollywood was. Now I've gotta be honest, as I watched I sat there trying to figure out who was a composite of whom in Hollywood. For me, it was like trying to figure out who the character Warren Beatty was in 'Shampoo' when I wasn't even around to understand it back then (i saw it 13 years later after it was out!), however it was fascinating to read it was a cross between Jay Sebring and Jon Peters. And this movie..has that Jay Sebring in it.And that was the interest for me in this, and where Quentin does what he does well - mix the pulp, but give you lots. There was lots of nostalgia, and lots of 'tell' of the Hollywood industry - back then...and some of now. Leonardo Di Caprio played what I saw as - 'every actor in the world' - he was known and at the cross roads in his career, and his only friend was his stuntman played by Brad Pitt. Yeah -- you get that Brad's character should have dumped him years ago and went out on his own, but by the end of the film, you got something that is few and far between in Hollywood...'real friends'. And you get to the point in the film where friendship is faced with 'the end of the road'.There are great 'cameos' in the film of both ACTORS and CHARACTERS of that time such as seeing the late Luke Perry made me choke up a bit, and it was full of 'Tarantino -isms'. The film may be long to some, I found the length fine. I found the story of this friendship coming to a head around one of the worst occurrences in Hollywood in the late 60s, done well. But make no mistake, the whole thing is based in a fairy tale, one that has all the fairy tale trappings including a happy-ever-after.And you know what? After watching this and knowing what I know -- what we all know -- yeah, I wished it would have all ended that way. I wish the world was wonderful, and people were nice and kind, and that Hollywood wasn't so dog eat dog...maybe...Once Upon A Time....Once Upon a Time. Ah-ha!A great break from all the Special Effects and Superhero films - a great entry into the nagging question and the fantasy aspect of it playing out -- while 'telling' on Hollywood. (Make no mistake, Tarantino DID tell a lot of stories in this one!!!) This is truly...a great film.",9,3,6,26 December 2019
Ghost Rider," Ghost Rider does have a life, but not yet
","Here you have a great opportunity for a film: Ghost Rider. Johnny Blaze who makes a deal with old Satan and becomes his 'bounty hunter'. Gosh what an interesting idea...but THIS telling of the story doesn't live up to what this film could have been. The best part of the film is the Ghost Rider. He just needed a better, tighter story.I thought Peter Fonda was a perfect cast as Satan choosing Johnny Blaze. It's an ironic cast, which is what made it good. Same with Sam Elliot as the Caretaker. After those two actors, it gets kinda muddled. I like Nic Cage, he has the 'melancoly' of Johnny Blaze, he just couldn't fully pull it off --- and some of that is not his fault, but the fault of the script. The Roxanne storyline, fell flat for me as well as Blackheart's did. Every time Blackheart and his minions were on screen, I thought of the TV series 'Buffy...' and they did it better.It's sad that this version of Ghost Rider came out the way it did, the story has such potential but I gave it a middle of the road score for the nice graphics of the Ghost Rider and the potential of something better up the road.",5,1,3,19 August 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Let the Summer..begin!
","X-Men, the Last Stand has a lot going for it. So much so that many of the things that should have had more development and time, didn't really matter because X-Men was very entertaining and a worthy movie for the beginning of the Summer Movie Season.There is a lot going on - but the one thing I came away with was that mutants - as well as humans - have a life cycle and it is pretty much explored here. All things being equal, we got to see both sides of the fence: the mutants quest for acceptance and the humans quest for being the superior top of the food chain.But here's the thing: A few holes that were done 'just in case there IS a 4th X-Men film' or because the character development wasn't complete or maybe a tad of each. The teens were great - except Magneto had more than the X-Men ...and that didn't make a lot of sense to me: especially in a school filled with mutant teens.And then there is Jean Grey/Phoenix. I did find a story there, but not enough of a story for her being one of the strongest mutants in the world. The director didn't do enough with this potential gem. I feel the same with Angel. A lot of opportunity there, but I didn't get much of a background from that character and I would have loved to seen more, know more about him.But...it didn't bother me too much from the popcorn entertainment value of the film. I loved it, it was a lot of fun. I do want to say the action outweighed the story - such as in X-Men 2, there was more of a story and the action and story blended nicely.But gosh.....it was great finally seeing quite a few dozen of those mutants do their thing. And Magneto? Well, what a 'yang' to Charles Xavier's 'ying' he was shown to be. He was cool in the worst sorta way but what power! I loved watching Sir Ian on the screen as this character.All in all a pretty decent beginning of the summer film season with a few holes, but a lot of good action scenes and a few things to think about when people of different natures and backgrounds try to co-exist together on this earth.",8,0,2,27 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Now this is what Film making is all about!
","What an excellent film. Again, I will point out that I was not a fan of the 'Lord of the Rings' books.I saw the first movie and was blown away. It got my interest. Then I saw this second installment, and I was even more blown away. And yes, everything you heard about Gollum is true. He steals the show here.But Gollum has alot of competition. I was so captivated by the battle scenes, they were real. If anyone really wants to see how a war is waged and how it is fought (anything goes!), this is a place to start.
I am saddened that this installment did not get named Oscar Best Picture for out of all of the Nominees, I would have chosen this over the MUCH overrated 'Chicago' any day. To do sequels in Hollywood is a mainstay these days.. but to Produce a sequel that is better than the first is rare (See the Godfather II for details) and this film is right up there with that kind of brilliance.A must not miss!",10,1,2,13 November 2003
The Incredibles," Wonderful!!!
","I got to go to a screening of this film as well -- and I've gotta tell ya, this movie was great. If you miss this film this fall, you'll miss an incredible film.I'm not going to spoil it with writing spoilers -- but this movie is fun, funny and absolutely great. Pixar does it again, Brad Bird also makes his mark here with a wonderful funny, family and friendship story.Take the kids (6/7 years old on up), take the parents, grandparents, college students, and all your rowdy friends...I'm a fan..and cannot wait to see it AGAIN on its Nationwide opening!!!",10,0,1,20 October 2004
The Mist," I was pleasantly surprised
","Steven King writes the best books. But...the folks who adapt them, including King himself, sometimes have trouble in placing the vision onto the BIG screen. This one, I was really surprised as how it did better than I thought it would.Frank Darabont had some challenges in bringing 'The Mist' to a captive audience, but I was captive. Granted there were a few bumps here and there, but I left the theater talking about it, disturbed by it. And wondering what I would do in the same situation. Who would I side with? And that I feel is the point. It was more than about 'the monster(s)' it was about people and Frank Darabont took the high road to concentrate on them and their conflicts more than 'the monster(s)'. That's what made it interesting to me. What the people had to do, what they were armed with, their thoughts, their beliefs, their selfishness or non-selfishness, panic or calm, and what to do in a crisis. Who becomes ALPHA, and who gets just nutty.I can identify with those who do not plan, cannot plan on the go, cannot devise plausible strategies and think that by saying 'we are a team' means you ARE a team. There is an 'I' team -- and that is the talent you bring to the table that others need to form that team. Without it, you make fatal decisions. Fatal decisions were done here, as well as wise ones. Again, what you chose delivers your destiny. 'The Mist' was very effective in telling this side of the tale. Which is why those who are seeking more of a 'story' may like this. Those who want the horror of 'monsters', well, 'The Mist' lets you decide what monsters you want to focus on. And yes, finally a twist ending worthy of saying...'disturbing twist ending'. Rod Serling would be proud.",8,1,3,1 December 2008
Transformers," A great adaptation of a popular cartoon
","Let me state the obvious and why I scored this pretty high even with my problems in this film: this will go down as one of the best adaptations of a popular cartoon to date. And how refreshing it was to see robots that looked like robots and not men in silly rubber suits. The special effects was top notch and this will be the film to beat in that area come Academy Award time.And let me say this: this is a guy's film. And that isn't a bad thing, it's rather good except for the blatancy of it being a 'guys' film with an element of Spielberg magic mixed in - the child with the 'My Little Pony' stuffed toy (was that Hasbro too? Great joke if so!) and the Decepticon that reminded me a lot of *batteries not included.For example, I loved the military guys - but their characters were not flushed out enough for me. I think it was because they wanted to get the teen element going. And that is one of the problems I had with the film.This film spent too much attention on the teen element: Shia LeBouf (or whatever his name was) was adequate. The female teen was as cardboard as most women in Micheal Bay movies (He REALLY needs to work on that). Nothing to write home to mom about.Speaking out what I think is one of Micheal Bay's biggest problems is that in many of his films, the women are lost in characterizations and they just seem to be there to keep the attention of the guys when the cars weren't screeching, transforming or metal was clanking itself together. Yeah, they tried to give them a story ... but as usually it was rushed and falls flat as a pancake. Be honest - take a minute to think of these women (two ...and the momma) ...and now take them out of the film. Miss them? No. And the tow truck driving at the end? Any male character could have done it. Would have LOVED to see some testosterone there to keep the action going like the military man who grabbed the motorcycle and kicked royal butt! She was no big whoop...except for the reasons I stated above.I would have given this film a ten if they got RID of the teen(s) and his first car element. If the story focused on the military men - that would have been fine. But the question of who would have gotten the Camaro needed to be solved. With better writing in that area, it could have been without the ho-hum teens and annoying parents.The other thing that bothered me was the camera work. I was never a fan of the shaky hand held MTV-type camera work and they should have left it alone here. There was some amazing special effects going on that was drowned in parts by this shaky-amateur camera work. Maybe its because Micheal Bay doesn't like Downtown Los Angeles. Everything seems to come to a head down there for him, and speaking as a bi-coastal Los Angeleno - it is a shaky place....Bottom line: I was hyped up and totally satisfied with Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, Jazz and all the rest of the Transformers and transform they did. Wonderful! Amazing! And as many reviewers before me have pointed out - the humans in this film were ...very second tier compared to them. And because of Optimus Prine, Megatron, Bumblebee, Jazz and all the rest of the Autobots and Decepticons is why this film got very high marks from me. This special effects work of making one of my favorite cartoons come 'alive' was outstanding, well worth the time even over my nit-picky objections and the hope that Transformers 2 (Oh come on - you KNOW there will be one!) story will be more worthy of them, the women inserted will actually be integral to the plot and we'll see some of those 'other' Transfomers we know will have us screaming in our seats now that we see them in all their glory in live action.",8,3,9,4 July 2007
Million Dollar Baby," A Story - A Plot - A wonderful work.
","I can only mirror a lot of what has been said about this film. It is one of those rarities - a film that has come along that you get involved in. Not for cheap thrills and popcorn, but for a story to be told and folks you care about.'Million Dollar Baby' seemed to come from no where - maybe because it didn't have a lot of slick marketing dollars during Decemeber, or hordes of teenagers to sit in the seats to make it #1 several weeks in a row...or 'ooh' and 'ahhh' over special effects. No, this is not that kinda film. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank all deserve every accolade they have been named to or receive.The great thing about this film is that not many came out like this - which is what makes it so outstanding. The story focuses on three lives and those around those lives. I laughed, I cried, but best of all, I thought this was one of the three best films of 2004.",10,4,7,14 February 2005
Mulholland Drive," David, David, David! Cheers and Bravo!
","I have to be honest. I was a cheerleader for the Mulholland Drive project ever since I went to the advertising upfronts at ABC and didn't see it on the fall schedule. From that moment on, I knew David Lynch had  something special. This surprised me, I actually think it's brilliant and wonderful.David Lynch is an acquired taste for some, including me. I saw 'Eraserhead' on a VHS at a party in High School and I couldn't 'get it' to save my life. Then David Lynch did other projects which I couldn't understand for the life of me. 'Mulholland Drive' I understood completely only watching the film once and boy was I surprised. The casting is perfect, I loved EVERYONE and this film makes Naomi Watts (Betty) an actress to watch in the future. I am not going to provide any spoilers here for this is a film that those who can identify, will, those who cannot wont. Some will get bogged down in details that aren't that important and miss the point completely. Just know, it contains alot of the 'David Lynch' touches..the weird, the insane and the wonderful, but this time, I actually understood it!This is a film for all of those actors/actress who ever had a 'Hollywood' stardom dream....that eventually turned into reality... and the cost of that burst dream as you were caught up in the trappings of it all. Fantastic film for David Lynch, just fantastic. ....'Silencio'....",10,4,6,28 November 2002
Dumb and Dumber," A movie that lives up to its title
","When this first came out in 1994, wild horses couldn't drag me to the theater to see it. Why? Preconceived notions. Thank goodness for Cable TV, or I never would have seen this film. I like it, it makes me laugh.This is not a masterpiece. This is not an academy award winning film, not a film of strategic plots, this is as sophomoric as it gets  -- and that's fine with me. Sometimes, ya gotta escape. This'll do it.The title says it all. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are perfect for their roles, every time I watch this film uncut, I am laughing. I was always thinking, 'How dumb can you get?' And in the next frame it gets dumber.This is one of those films you just have fun with. Either you like this kind of humor or you don't. But the world is in such turmoil, this is a welcomed, stupid, silly, break that hits just the right spot. I find it 'stupid-funny' beyond belief.",8,98,135,17 May 2003
8 Mile," Boo-hoo for the White Rapper
","For me, there was no way to see this movie other than a feature length promo for Eminem's CD's. Will it hold up over the years? No. This is entertainment for the white rap audience to accept themselves and have a 'hero', nothing more.For me, this was like watching Pat Boone perform Little Richard tunes for acceptance and miracles upon miracles, he's beloved and embraced by everyone. Who gives a damn about Little Richard during all of this? And that is my point. (Before you 'howl', I am aware of how many years ago that was -- and how supposedly different the world was --  but the idea behind Eminem is the same and proves to me the world hasn't changed. And yes I know Dr. Dre produced alot of his CD work, but I will stand by my Pat Boone analogy.)Granted, Eminem plays a 'fish outa water' character that overcomes his obstacles to become a big star in the crappy portion of Detroit (or Chicago, or Philadelphia, or Los Angeles or ....???) Come on folks, like HE wouldn't? Just because his mom was an alcoholic, etc., etc.? Please. My heart bleeds for Eminem's problems. You just KNOW he's got the odds against him. Please.This coulda been a movie of the week on a network channel except they needed the 'white boy recording star of the day' to star in it and get it to the screen. And it WILL make money for there are TONS of young Eminem music fans. But if you aren't one, this film will do nothing for you.My point is replace 'rap' with any genre that Black musicians perfected...like 'blues' or 'jazz', throw the mega white selling music flavor of the day in and and 'poof' you have a Hollywood Cinderella Music story...and mainstream white America going out to purchase tickets for it.I am sorry, its a sad excuse for a $10.00 theater ticket and my time. I am reminded of many films for music-video artists: Madonna, Brittney Spears, Mandy Moore, etc., and now Eminem. Ya just know in a few years this will keep going and going and going...for that is Hollywood. Good script or bad. Great acting or great acting right now. You just know the scripts will include an alcoholic parent/an abusive parent/a protective streak for a sibling/a black or gay character with a heart of gold and a po' white kid who sold millions of CD's trying to make it in a fictionalized autobiography.Please. Enough already.",Null,0,2,8 November 2002
Shrek 2," This does the near impossible, it's better than the first!
","This movie is going down in the books as one of those rare occurrences: A sequel that is better and funnier than the first.I laughed till I cried. The jokes were fun, the animation was super, I had a wonderful time with CHILDREN in the theater! And the theater I was in -- the children were fully engrossed in the film. That TOO is rare.In Shrek 2 all of your favorites are back -- Shrek, Princess Fiona and Donkey. (Myers, Diaz and Murphy) and new characters who are all just as Fabulous...but the new character: Puss 'n Boots, is just to die for.I'm not going to give away anything in this movie, my fellow writers already have..but if you're looking for a good time, entertaining, fun film that knocks on pop culture, fairy tales and what the true meaning of 'Happily Ever After' whether you're a size 2 or a size 32...then this is the film to see.Shrek 2 is the best!",10,1,1,22 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Female on the trail of Revenge
","I had every intention of skipping this film when it was released. You see, movies with Martial Arts have never been on the top of my list, regardless of who does it. BUt this film came to me through word of mouth and once I saw it in the theater, I could not wait to see Kill Bill Volume 2! This is not your typical Martial Arts film, but then again, yes it is. It's humorous, fun, action packed and its lead character is a woman who's trying to piece her life back together after an unfortunate instance - the death quad she used to work for, thought they killed her. By all intents and purposes, she should have been dead. But she survived, which is bad news for each of them because she is hot on the trail of finding them and her main bone of contention, Bill.Her travels to get to the elusive Bill is not without it's fair share of pain and destruction for the heroine. But this is what I like about films by Quesntion Tarrentino - there isn't a straight path to anything. You're not quite sure of which of the events you're watching happened first, but you are engrossed in watching to figure it out.And on top of that, you never know what era you are in when you are watching. You have all of pop culture in your face and this film is no exception. There is plenty here for the die-hard martial art fans (with cameos from some of the most known in the traditional martial arts films) and for us that know a bit here and there (okay, I saw a few of the traditional Bruce Lee, Jet Li and Jackie Chan movies), there is stuff for us too -- but even more creatively speaking, it's all here for those aren't marital arts adapted. The story is quite the woman's story and the heroine meets up with some of the most strongest women ever ...along with the dirtiest of men.You'll want to know 'what the deal' is about the heroine and you begin to piece it together in this installment. It's not very pretty, and you'll have questions...Why did her group turn on her? What happened to the baby she was carrying? Who is Bill really, and where is he? And why is she driven to Kill Bill? I just fell in love with this film. It's Tarrintino at his top form, and that is what makes it good entertainment.",9,1,3,15 September 2006
Saw II," Awwwwww!
","In watching the first Saw, I thought it was one of the most ambitious thriller/horror films to date. I loved the story and why the central character did what he did.Now I'll be even more honest about the first one. I loved the central character, loved his name, 'John' and ... I loved his age. It all seemed to fit to make this one of the most entertaining and shocking films made.Now comes Saw II, which I was looking forward to -- and it was fine, until the 'studio system' stepped in to make this a franchise. Don't get me wrong, this film is good. But I missed the 'old man'. They made him 'younger' in mannerisms instead of more on the older, painful side as implied in the first one. And most of all -- I hate that 'they' are trying to make this into a franchise instead of leaving it alone.Saw II also contains a bit of the social commentary of the first and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also has that story that you never see coming which makes 'john' such a great character and those around him so oblivious to his games. But oblivious in a smart way.Forgive me if I am a bit upset with where this is going - it just seems so 'money grubbing studio' to me, for such a great story and idea. Obviously, young audiences accepted an 'older lead character'. Even though I am aware that 'john' could NOT go on for long because of his predicament. But that was part of the charm of this story for me.A good film sequel but personally -- I was hoping that Saw II would end and not be dragged down like all the other great horror stories that studio heads saw dollar signs for.",7,0,0,27 February 2006
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Bold and very interesting! (Some spoilers)
","I ran into this film on Cable-TV and I found this to be a very bold, emotional and creative piece of work. When you hear folks go around saying, 'It's the same old thing in movies today', they haven't seen this film. I was entertained and in turn felt for the characters, especially the lead, Hedwig. There was alot of information I wasn't aware of which made this even more interesting to me, and it was presented in a way that didn't turn me away but made me want to know more about these characters and their plight.Here you have the age old story of someone very talented trying to make it in rock music but is condemned to playing the more seeder places because someone stole their music/act. What makes this story different is that the talent that had his music taken is an immigrant from Berlin who had a horribly botched sex change operation. The botched sex change operation was due, in part, to escape communist Berlin to come to America and be 'free and creative' and well, everything doesn't go the way Hedwig imagined.  The music Hedwig performs reflects those struggles and inner turmoil. You do feel for this character, you begin to understand this character and you'll want things to be better for this character considering all the crap Hedwig has gone through. Events in recent history pepper Hedwig's story and makes for that greater conflict within Hedwig. Plus having Hedwig as the 'star' of a band in which some of the members not wanting to continue in that seedy performance circuit; wanting to be more, to do more. Make no mistake, Hedwig is talented, tough and driven to prove he is the talent. But what makes Hedwig all of those things is what makes the movie interesting.This is not a film for everyone in this PC world but I recommend it for those who like to expand their film experience beyond the Hollywood mold and take a look at something more creative.",8,0,1,31 December 2002
The Insider," A mature film and telling of a tale..for everyone
","It is very hard these days to go in a pitch a film to a major studio or distributor that doesn't have loads of special effects, sex, young people having sex, the car chases, profanity. I am sure the first words out of the mouth of an executive is, 'Well, what makes this film sexy?' That means, what puts butts in the seats and sells popcorn.Here you have a film that tells the story of a Corporate whistle blower. Not just any whistle blower, but one for big tobacco and he tells his tale on the one place Corporations don't want to have their tales exposed: The TV Newsmagazine '60 Minutes'. Does this sound like a fun film? A film that will get the teens going in droves or adults to shell out $8.00? No. But it did.The strengths of this film is based on the performances of the characters. as well as in the pacing and telling of the tale. Being that I am not a Russell Crowe fan, he made me a fan of his work with this film. He plays the lead character, the whistle blower Dr. Wygand and makes you really feel for him, his family, his decisions. matched well is the performance of Al Pacino who plays the Journalist/Producer for 60 minutes, Lowell. Al Pacino is as equally wonderful showing how stories are developed, produced and killed..in the corporate TV world of '60 Minutes'.'The Insider' does one thing extremely well and it makes you an insider as you watch. You become involved in the Wygand story for sure, but you also get really involved with the workings of getting a story together for 60 Minutes and the bigger corporation, CBS. You realize getting a story together for '60 Minutes' isn't all that easy and even if you have a story -- the surrounding elements of competitive Journalism with Magazines and Newspapers as well as the Network you work can be a battle ground within itself.This is a look into real Journalism to tell the people of the Nation, of the World when something is endangering your life and how hard it is to get it on air, to face so much including lawsuits and jail just to tell a story -- make the public aware. This is before the 'spin', before the 'politics', before the looking for sexy entertainment value that has overtaken Journalism and TV today. Director Michael Mann knows how to build suspense without drawing conclusions -- allowing you to use your brain and do it yourself.An Excellent film -- excellent acting, excellent story.",10,1,2,13 February 2004
The Dark Knight," Well Done
","This was a movie that was being talked about by Batman fans way before the Heath Ledger tragedy - and one that was anticipated for this summer. As the stories and fan-boys began 'leaking' out information about it, you knew this was going to be something special - and it was. The bittersweetness of this is of course the sadness in Heaath Ledger's death, for he made the Joker quite the nemesis of Batman that crawled under HIS skin...as well as ours.But here's something else I didn't expect while watching the film: fine casting. Sure, everyone is centering in on the central characters, (Batman, The Joker, Commissioner Gordon, Harvey Dent...etc.) of which they should, but if you look closely again, there are some glimpses and references of characters that will be showing their evil little heads (hopefully) later on in the Batman series. Casting from the smallest corner to the largest, these actors were 'right-on'. You can say that this was the best ensemble cast of actors you'll see so far this year. The Dark Knight (should/will) win the SAG award for that and justifiably so - the performances here are to 'write home about'.Gotham is darker, is troubled and its people - confused. They don't know whom to trust. And 'Batman' - what to make of him really? There's nothing like seeing a town in anarchy and Director Chistopher Nolan plays it all. Actually, the title says it all and that is quite the spoiler of this film - you'll understand after you see it.Christan Bale's Bruce Wayne is quite the duel personality as well, finding out all too quickly how human he really is against what he really does - day and night. The Joker, played wonderfully by Health Ledger has become Batman's conscious - telling Batman things he did not wish to consider himself about how Gotham may see and eventually treat him, which had many grains of truth. Or does it? That's how crafty the Joker is, and Heath played him well.Yes, there are wonderful gadgets, chases (the game of 'chicken' between Batman and the Joker on Gotham's streets deserves an Oscar on its own!), suspense, the cinematography is gorgeous, the set design makes Gotham come alive and the sound...the SOUND and score/music are all just perfect here. These are too key elements that add a lot to a film and all should be congratulated for placing together a wonderful film experience.The Dark Knight is a film you must see at least twice so you can 'absorb' everything. A must see for the summer (try to see in IMAX if you can!)",10,2,5,20 July 2008
There's Something About Mary," Ya gotta have a sense of humor!
","When this film came out with all of the PR and things, I hated it. I hated it without even seeing it. Then, as with many movies, I caught this on Digital Cable TV, by accident. I had NO intention of seeing it, but once I did, I cannot tell you how much I loved it.This is the Farrley Brothers at their funniest. The idea is simple, a guy (Ben Stiller) who had a crush on a woman (Carmen Diaz) he knew since high school and continued to yearn for her privately, finally getting an opportunity to try to reconnect what never got going. This is something almost everyone can identify with.What makes this work...is its a dead-on hard hitting comedy.  The Farrley Brothers spared no one: male or female, handicapped or able bodied, black or white, rich or poor, job or not, straight or gay, animal or vegetable, blonde or brunette, educated or not. It is NOT a cinematic masterpiece so don't look for one, it is not a punch line comedy or slapstick comedy, it is sophomore humor done very well because you're going to be laughing at what you think you shouldn't no matter how much you want to say you would never laugh at something like that. Plus the Farrley Brothers added in 'some things' that...well... may have just happened to you at some point in your adolecence, and put a comedic/gross quality to it that shocks you into laughing at it. All through the film you might laugh because you're thinking, 'Better them than me'.....even if it was you!Not for eveyone's taste, even those who think they know comedy, but this is that kinda comedy that is hard to do once you've reached maturity and forgotten what it was like to laugh at simple things. This is as simple as it gets. Don't put too much into it, it is what it is, and to me, it was really funny! Good Show!",8,93,121,22 April 2003
La La Land," LA LA LAND is a lullaby
","I am a big fan of Hollywood Musicals (From Busby Berkley ones to Hedwig and the Angry Inch from the Directors, Choreographers and Dancers like Astaire, Kelly, Caron, Fosse, Dandridge, Charisse, Rivera, Nicolas Brothers, Tune, Moreno, etc... even little Shirley Temple) the ones done 'back in the day' and some of the more recent ones, which is why I cannot express my disappointment in watching LA LA LAND. So much so, turned to another premium channel that showed the late artist's Prince's 'Sign O' The Times' (which hadn't been shown in 20 years) and found that more on track for a 'tip to stage musicals' than LA LA LAND (and let me add I was not a big Prince fan, and I know this was a 'concert' stage film of one of his recordings more than a 'musical' so this is making a point).LA LA LAND tells the old tale of a struggling (jazz) musician and budding actress in Los Angeles trying to make it. Yes, you've seen it over 100 times, and this is just one more telling. They run into each other at 'meaningless but hoping to get discovered while making ends meet' Hollywood functions they are at. They're dreamers in the land where dreams can or may not come true, Los Angeles - or a reasonable facsimile thereof. One of the biggest problems is that I found the leads, 'eh' - no spark for me between the two, no real 'heart' for me between the two, no reason to make me want to root for their success OR failure whether they were in Los Angeles or anyplace else.The production numbers are -'eh'. The music is - 'eh'. The dancing is 'eh'. The story is - 'eh'. And 'eh' seems perfect for this 'eh' generation that seems to want to like anything that is a way-watered down or blatantly copied (oops, 'sampled' now called 'homage') version of something that was done infinitely better before.The emphasis on colors throughout this film are like the colors on products from 'The Price is Right' - bright, attention-grabbing and staged to where you want to buy them where you can find them. But I didn't buy into this. Want to see good musicals with bright colors, bright music, boy meets girl and dancing..? Bollywood has done it better, much, much, MUCH better and I am as American as apple-pie mind you! I just love musicals.(For example, Bollywood films like 'Jab We Met' or 'Bajirao Mastani' or even 'Cocktail' are done much better).I would never compare LA LA LAND to ANY the musicals of its past - they are classics and you root for the subjects, tape your feet, get transported to their world, watch amazing choreography and whimsy - even in the more tragic of musical tales. So is LA LA LAND a homage to the old musicals? Tries to be, however just didn't work for me.",2,2,3,16 September 2017
Saw," Not at ALL what I expected!
","I have been watching horror/thriller films for many years now so that when a new one comes out, it's either a rehash of something I've seen before or a poor remake--of something I've already seen before.Then comes Saw. When it hit the theaters, I didn't want to see it, for the reasons I stated above. 'Just another slasher movie', I thought. And in 2004 I'd been disappointed with so many so-called horror films, I didn't even feel like giving this one a chance. I blame the marketing of the film first and foremost, they didn't market it for its originality -- it was the same cookie-cutter marketing which bored me to tears.But how wrong I was. I watched this on digital cable TV. This film is so much better than one would think. It kept me riveted, and no--I didn't see the end coming -- which made it even more worth while to me.What also made it one of the best stories since 'Nightmare on Elm Street' was who was doing this and why. At this time in my life, I can really understand why this person is doing what they did. In this version, I am sure for many old people could, I could almost bet something similar to this has run through their minds -- at one time or another. That's horror. Real Horror.Bravo. Now, I can't wait to get the DVD for the second one. I am looking forward to see how that develops.",8,0,1,12 January 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Actually, I missed the knights who say....ni.
","Whoo-boy, this is the blockbuster that never should have been.... a 'blockbuster'.It should have been promoted as 'just another film BEFORE blockbuster season'. By that, no one would have had any BIG expectations.I didn't read the book. And from the crowd I went with that HAD read the book, they were happier that I didn't and just watched this film as a movie. They said a lot was missing and misdirected. Sadly, I sat through the film watching so-so action, wooden acting and plots that went no where with an International cast of first class actors. Those who are harping on Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou really shouldn't. I think they did the best with what they had to work with. This disappointment is clearly on the director, Ron Howard and the approved screenplay.For example, during the alleged 'action' scenes, I never saw such choreographed product placement. I swear, I was thinking: 'I should buy a BMW. They look great!' and 'I'd like to come out of a Rolls Royce like that at my wedding.' The story? I didn't care.The code? Big Whoop. If you can't figure it out in 20 minutes or less at the beginning of the picture, I feel sorry for you. I did 'nod' off at a few points, but lucky for me, got jolted awake by the audience laughing.Tom, Audrey, Jean, Albert, Jurgen and Sir Ian did what they could with what they had. Sadly, I didn't get any build up of suspense, intrigue, international espionage and the questionable dealings of the 'church'. I got a tad bit of this -- and a tad bit of that but I felt like I was eating fast food....Satisfying for a moment but not very filling and the calories complied on me later are sinful for taking such an indulgence.And yes, like many other comments I read, I sat there thinking, 'Who could have done a better job directing this?' John Woo? David Lynch? No, my choice was definitely Darren Afonsky -- but any of those named above would have had you on the edge of your seat with their interpretation and view of the book. I found this two and a half hours of a film that just doesn't live up to all the hype.It's not fair to call this a 'stinker'..but it isn't a blockbuster of entertainment either. But....just to stay awake...I did have a gas humming tunes from 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' in my theater chair - clearly a better film on just a part of this issue.",5,0,5,21 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Very Nice Effort
","Okay, I never read the Harry Potter Books. I couldn't have cared less, but I have nieces and nephews and other children in my life who are from ages 7 to 12 who have. What I had to do was remember what it was like when I was that age, so long ago, and what 'new' movies I had to entertain myself with.
So...I had 'Oliver!', 'Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' and 'Chitty, Chitty, Bang! Bang!'. Other than those, it was 'R' rated films that I was more interested in.  Why? For that is what interested me via what Hollywood made available. I was 'too old' for those cutie Disney Animated cartoons of that time, and too young for the adult theme films that were being advertised which I DID want to see. This is why I like this film, it brings back the genre for children, the wonder, the fantasy in film just for them.A nice effort production wise, with the casting, with the story. Children love fantasy, wonder, adventure, a character THEIR age doing and thinking like THEY would and...watching kids eat lots of 'sweets'. This Harry Potter film fit the bill. For me as an adult, it was...nice. For children between 7 and 12, its fantastic. The special effects were neat, the story was engaging for them, but what I liked the best was the school itself. I thought that the classes and interactions of the children with each other were on their level. So it was at a Wizards school. Point is, it could be at ANY school. (or boarding school!)In my surroundings, there have been a few adults/parents screaming about how this film and the school 'Hogwarts' promotes kids to get into the black arts. I think that is so awful to think that, and I think it does not give children the benefit of the doubt. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a nice little film about something a child/pre-teen has fun with. I actually compared it to the Disney film 'Fantasia' and the scene of Mickey being the 'Sorcerer's Apprentice'. I watched that over and over as a 6 year old and trust me, I had no desire to get into 'the black arts'.To me, this film is geared towards that audience that has been forgotten AND portrayed in the last 15 years, the 7 to 12 year olds. Yes, Disney had alot of animation that was marketed to that group of children, but its been quite sometime to make a long full length feature film of fantasy where children are the focus, and they are just...children. Reminds me of 'Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' and 'Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang'...fantasy films for the 7 to 12 year old to enjoy the movie going experience on their level, but NOT talking DOWN to them.Children under 7 may be a bit scared at some parts and teens over 13 may not get into this film at all. But for the 7 to 12 year olds, this film is a nice one for them in the same vein as 'Oliver!' and 'Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' was for me.",10,1,1,28 November 2002
The Happening," This could have been good, I think.
","I am probably of the small minority who thought that M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' was a so-so, highly predictable film and that 'Signs' was a thriller at his dark comedic best. 'The Village 'didn't bother me so much and his other films, well, I just can't say anything about them others haven't already said. So here comes 'The Happening' and I've gotta tell ya, the ball really, really dropped on this one. It could have been one of his better films.Who's to blame? Well... ya never know. When I can see that a story and plot is on its way somewhere and then goes South, its so easy to blame the writer, producer and director (in this case, M. Night Shyamalan for all.) But nowadays, I give just as equal blame to the studio (financier), test audiences and distributor as well.The first 1/2 hour to 40 minutes was a little dark even for M. Night Shyamalan but I enjoyed watching this side unravel. I loved the mystery - What was going on? What was it? Then I began to notice the things that bugged me. One thing I would not have done was leave the classroom background and try to get into the 'family life' of a few of these folks. It didn't work. I though sticking with the young adults would have been more interesting.But the biggest thing that bothered me was finding out what the problem was. I was incredibly let down. Not because I didn't believe that problem wasn't a possibility... it is. But because of the dark way M. Night Shyamalan laid it out in the beginning, he wimped out in showing the audience 'what it was'. Ruined the film for me.I agree with my friends who had also seen the film that it needed to stay with its dark & violent tone. But if so, therein poses a problem for M. Night Shyamalan. How to make what is happening go from supernatural to...well..horrific scary. And if he could, how not to make it look so silly and get the point across. Here's where he should have gone back to 'Signs' for a possible answer. That point may also lie with Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' of a formula of which I also thought could have help him out of the supernatural/horrific problem of something we never considered a threat before.I pondered the almost silly suggestion of one of my friends who thought he should go 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' forest kinda thing, while another one of my friends added, 'Well at least he could have a rogue philodendron the little girl brought home earlier that gave clues as to what was to come, or some ivy crawled up the side of the house and then you see folks dead.' I laughed at that, but there is a point.The film isn't horrible, it just doesn't hit the mark intended. You may be left thinking there is more that could be done to get the point across since it began so 'not' of the M. Night Shyamalan formula. But I can also see the challenges in making 'what it is'...believable and memorable to an audience. Me...? Well, I would have went with the mysterious crawling ivy.",5,1,3,1 December 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Everyone's a critic..including me!
","I just saw this film and I really LOVED this film. It was what you go to films on a Saturday Night like this for..entertainment, thrills and escape-ism!There have been allot of things said about 'Matrix Reloaded', and I gotta tell ya, I am NOT going to put down or knock anyone's reviews of this....good or bad. I found this a thrill ride, and it met what I expected of it. Keanu was great, Carrie-Ann did her thing, Lawrence was still rough, ready and steadfast in his belief...and the new additions were entertaining. The movie went at a nice pace for me, I don't know what many are upset about. One thing that made me love this film to death was that I worked in a big-time computer company so as I watched this, I was entertained by this film..that is where my head was. A re-loaded program with a little bit more. Come on folks...it's not more than that and lives quite nicely to that expectation!!!Maybe I'm giving away the whole concept behind the film, or maybe I'm just relating this to my company's C++ and SQL Programming, the daily Microsoft monopoly screw we're all experiencing, the Apple Guys vs. The IBM guys and the two guys in my office who swear by Compaq or Gateway, the McAfee Guys and the Norton Utilities Guys, Firewalls, Hidden codes and hidden program designers, freelancers who know more than anyone, etc., etc...'The Matrix Reloaded' is what I can relate to and loved every minute of it. And that 'ending' thing....didn't bother me, I can't wait until November. (Here's something ELSE to consider...before most of us were born, many folks went to the movies and saw 'serials'. Many of those were Westerns and they ended with 'To be continued' just to bring those theater patrons back to the movies the next week. Hey, maybe....this is a homage to that. If so, good for them!)So I say...take a chill pill. Either you 'get it' or ya don't. Either you can relate it on a computer geek level or you just watch it for the kick-butt Karate scenes and special effects. Maybe that's not enough for ya. Maybe ya don't get the 'Zion' thing, maybe ya do, maybe it's not important to you. But its ALL good. That is what films are out there to do and because we're all talking about it so much, it did what it was supposed to. I had a great time and I hope others will too. Grab some friends, go see 'Matrix Reloaded', live it up. It's fun!",10,0,0,17 May 2003
The Departed," Oh captain, my captain....!
","The Departed is - a good film.It was more than what I expected, and even though many reviewers have stated there was much violence, I found that there wasn't as much as usual in the Martin Scorsese films of that genre.What was interesting that on many occasions, the violence does come from out of nowhere and sometimes, unexpected. The Deaparted is a story about 'who is who': law enforcement having an organized crime mole embedded in their department and the organized crime folks having a police mole embedded in their department - each racing against time to find out who is who.The performances of note do belong to Jack Nicholson (I do hope he does get an Academy Award nomination out of this!), Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Jack Nicholson owned the role of Frank Costello - he was slimy, crazy, calm, sexual and murderous. Leonardo DiCaprio has turned into quite the serious adult actor and not the pin-up pretty boy little girls drooled over. In this film, he's tough, violent, emotionally hurt, confused and used. Matt Damon also deserves kudos's for being one of the best characters in this film for he was calm, cool, collective and a cold bald faced liar.The supporting cast was just as interesting: Alex Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Walhberg in roles that drove the story along in ways you couldn't fathom - and that's what makes this film watchable. There's a lot going on, even in this films' 2 and a half hours, but everything is leading to a tie-up in the end.Martin Scorsese brings his film team and film-making style to this project, which at times had me laughing at one minute and at other times in shock as to what was going on.The Boston area is captured very nicely here. But be warned, the language is hard in this film, as so the violence - and nothing is PC. Nothing. From the beginning of this film to the end, you'll know it. If you get offended easily, this is a film you might be uncomfortable with viewing. So I'll close by saying, up until viewing this film, I loved drinking cranberry juice for the fun of it. I guess I'll find another drink - captain, my captain.",10,0,0,7 October 2006
Psycho," A Masterpiece.
","First let me share with you why this film scares me:Norman Bates killed Marion Crane on the day and the year I was born.It's true!!!I often wondered why my mom called me Psycho a lot as I was growing up. Now, I know.
All jokes aside, this is a Masterpiece of work. You have an excellent screenplay. Excellent actors. Excellent Direction. This film will scare you, thrill you, shock you and even make you laugh...Where to I begin?!?! Camera techniques used to enhance the drama, that creepy house by the motel...unfaithfulness, men in womens clothing, Odepus Complexes, drinking, lying, cheating, stealing,...adams apples!!!Psycho has it all. This is the film film students must see and there are darned good reason's why. No one does it like Hitchcock (No, not even YOU Mr. DePalma) and this is one of HIS top 10 too.I'll sound like one of those old women in a rocking chair on the porch: 'Oh yeah, Hitchcock did it first. All the rest of them - that Speilberg fella...that Lucas guy...That Jackson dude, you name it..they all got their technique from ole Hitch.'Here it is folks, one from the 'master'. One of the best there is.Enjoy.",10,0,1,13 July 2003
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Going' with the crowd here...
","Dreamworks and Paramount should congratulate themselves on putting out this wonderful summer fare. It got us to do what was intended, go see a movie with lots of action and neat special effects. Unfortunately, no one said it had to be good.I'm sure every other review write how wonderful the 'first' Transformers was. It was. Even the trailers were exciting. This one seemed to have all the elements but missed the mark completely. It was like watching a bunch of scenes thrown together to make a film look like a beloved toy franchise.Another thing is I saw how little boys, seven to ten, were just lovin' this film while everyone else was looking at them as though they were nuts. They were not because this film, was totally designed for them: no story, lots of 'cool' colorful robots on the screen. Except for the language. When I was 7 to ten, I don't think my parents would have like me hearing all the swear words that Dreamworks, Paramount, the Ratings board, etc. allowed in...and parents not quite getting what PG 13 ACTUALLY means. Was it because of the robots that were 'mouthing' them, that it was acceptable to these folks? If so, for shame. Of course 7 to 10 year old boys (and some older ones too) aren't going to get the implications of this, but many of the older people did and I must say that was TOTALLY uncalled for in a film franchise like this. It wasn't cute.Then there are the humans. Sorry, didn't care for the leads, and if you took every single one of them out...they would not have been missed. Only the Armies. The Armies made perfect sense, they should have stuck with them. Actually, it would have made a better story just with the Transformers and the armies. And I was upset that they introduced...ever so slightly...the Pretenders. Or were they the Pretenders, honestly I don't think the filmmakers were too keen on how to develop them. Ori and Bay were more concerned with making MAXIM cover shoots come to life, they missed a golden opportunity here.And yes, I am SO disappointed at the beginning...Sideways(?) didn't get enough time for me, as did not Devastator at the end. I know about the Constructors, but gee wiz, they just appeared on the screen, all willy nilly and all we had for most of this was visual effects. No story. Opportunity missed.I am so exhausted over this Transformers 2 hodgepodge, that I fully expect Spielberg to want to introduce the Dinobots in Transformers 3. Not a bad idea, just get another writer and director on it because I know it's itching under his thumb right now.So should you go out and see it? It's entertainment, but not the best of the 09 summer. It's mindless, and that's good. In IMAX it's fantastic, but don't expect academy award winning material her except for below the line - and that's the point. Got a few bucks to spare - watch. If not, please don't. And if you're waiting for the DVD, I know many parents WILL be disappointed over the unnecessary use of ribald language here.Dreamworks, Paramount, et al can pop open the champaign for a huge money making opening week and rightfully so, they got us to go out and take a look. Too bad, everything that is supposed to be success is based on how much money it made, because some of the better movies so far, didn't make a lot of money, but deserve a look too. And..two and a half hours was incredibly TOO long for this, even in IMAX.So I'll sit and anxiously wait for Transformers 3 - only because I know its comin'...but just a curiosity....hey is um...JJ Abrams and David Knoepp doin' anything....special....'bout now....???",4,1,5,28 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Ya Gotta Love Technology...
","I read reviewers reviews from all the big papers, I saw all of Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning's press junkets -- but I still went to see this film.I liked this film. Not love..but liked. Why? Well..it wasn't too far from the HG Wells original telling...and I think that is what is confusing folks. Sure, there was a few more CGI things added in...and a few twists and turns here and there for dramatic effect..but the story was still the story.I wasn't expecting 'mega' blow out of the martians...not with PG-13..and it was as PG-13 as it could be. With an 'R' rating, I would have expected quite a whole lot more. But I am not the kind of movie goer that needs to see every detail of death and destruction -- and this film didn't do that. Tom Cruise was okay in this film....Dakota Fanning was wonderful and Tim Robbins almost stole the show. 'Blockbuster' material in 2005 this is not -- but what it IS -- is a 'good' interpretation of a classic.",8,1,5,29 June 2005
Wedding Crashers," How this film made all that money, I'll never know.
","I watched the 'uncorked' version of this film, and I like a good bunch of silly laughs. This didn't have a good bunch of silly laughs. I barely laughed at all.This film started off interestingly enough - two guys (Vaughn and Wilson) who crashed weddings to get girls. All kinds of weddings. Preying on females who were caught up in the moment of the ceremony.Then they crash the wedding of the worst family in the world - which seemed pretty appropriate for these losers. Were the antics funny? No, not to me. I got so bored I was patiently waiting for the 'fart' jokes to come along to save it. (To me, fart jokes are desperate attempts at comedy when everything else has gone downhill.) None of those jokes...no real jokes at all.I didn't care for any of these characters overall - all of the stuff that was done, I had seen in other comedy movies before - done a million times better -- but I will say that the cameo towards the end and the scenes that followed WAS the highlight of the film to me. But not enough to redeem the entire film.",5,0,1,27 February 2006
Joker," A Man's Decent Into Madness
","No, this is not the joker as you have seen him these past decades, it is what made him who he is - and at times, not a pleasant picture.It has been sometime for films to finance and back character studies into 'why'. In the 70s, there were plenty of them, now its 2019, and here is one. It is Joaquin Phoenix's performance from frame one to the end. It's dark, you'll laugh, you'll possibly be shocked - but he keeps you engaged in his portrayal of the character, which in films like this, is of the utmost importance. It does take one back to that decade - all of it's color and darkness. And there is no need for an overkill in special effects and imagery. It's dreary, just like his life. But he becomes the epitome of what many have been holding back for years - and so, what will become.I really appreciate this film because of that, as it does go back to a time before we got caught up in so much, we forget about the character itself, so know this is a character study of what we already know how it will turn out. So, why did I give the film an 8 instead of a 10? Well..I am a fan of the deep character development of ..Travis Bickle and...Randle McMurphy...and..Rupert Pupkin and for me there was a tad bit too much reference of them than an homage should be - but again, Joaquin Phoenix gives the best character performance for me since Gladiator and for a DC Comic Book character, one of the best without the 3 decades of cinematic bells and whistles .",8,2,3,6 October 2019
Kingpin," This film is rude, crude and very funny
","When this film first came out, I had no use for it. Then I was home sick one day and caught it on cable. I laughed my butt off. This is a crude, rude and down right funny film. It also helped that I grew up near the Pennsylvania Dutch and plenty of bowling lanes. Two seemingly safe areas that the Farley brothers attack it without mercy. Sometimes it gets down right disgusting and many cannot stomach, but overall, its very funny.Bill and Woody were funny as anything. The Disco-era beginning makes me laugh like crazy. The commercial Bill Murray does is to die for. This film will offend alot of people, and many references played for humor may make folks feel uncomfortable, but I loved it. If you are easily offended, this is NOT the film for you. But for everyone else who likes rude, crude and deviously funny -- often at the expense of others kinda humor, this is a gem to see.",10,42,52,19 November 2002
Hancock," Eh -- not that bad, really.
","The only thing I expected out of Hancock was summer entertainment, and that is basically what I got.And I enjoyed it, everything about it. What you have is a very troubled hero that thinks no one cares about him as a person, that he is alone in his quest and everything he does is taken for granted in this money effected world. I found the latter very interesting - and the one thing that was pretty evident in this film. A superhero who's feats of super-heroism always carried a price tag rather than a humanity tag - until a public relations pro steps in to try to change that.Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman are all wonderful with what they have - and yes, I do agree at points you wish the script and story would have flushed developments out further. And the nemeses for Hancock? Could have been better when you consider what we find Hancock out to be, and have done. But ya gotta wonder - is that avenue on hold for a second installment? There's a thought - and probably an impending reality, where we will have a second installment that will be infinitely better than the first for the material IS there to work with and have not been fully explored.I can also admit that I was a little kid when the term 'summer blockbuster' began for Hollywood and Hancock reminds me of a summer blockbuster of way back then - CGI? What CGI?!? Blue screen, miniature models, imagination, lights and the wizardry of design and skill of special effects in make up and a GOOD story that is told well - yeah, those were the days. With Hancock, you DO have a 'good story' that never gets its full due but while watching Hancock, I did get that 'back in the day summer fare' nostalgic feeling...if only for a moment here and a moment there.It would be unfair to say the film is completely uneven - it has its moments and when it clicks, good ones at that. But not enough to give it it's complete identity. What this has done is make me curious to see a 'Hancock 2' -- errr -- with a completely different production, post production & direction crew and a newly committed writing team to take a stab at it.",7,3,8,5 July 2008
Kong: Skull Island," A Saturday Matinée Kong
","It's been a while since I went to the movies just to see an entertaining, Saturday Matinée. I don't even think people use the words anymore, but I will say this is where this version of Kong belongs and fits in well with that type of genre. I am a fan of this kinda stuff and have been ever since I was 6 or 7 years old -- those bigger than life creatures who got that way because of man's environmental foibles or because man never paid attention to 'that island over there that popped up outta nowhere, gee, I wonder what's on it. Let's go and see...' Ha! Kong: Skull Island brings all the enjoyment back in films like this. I wasn't looking for a deep message, or outstanding performances, just an adventure to escape for a few hours with friends and movie crowd who like this too.Kong is CGI'ed and it's okay, not too distracting. You also get to see those rare moments of Kong as at a few points you see the 'sad and lonely side' of Kong's existence on the Island between the fights and pyrotechnics. The film takes place in 1973, and there are references to it, but it really didn't matter to me as it could have been done in any year and still have the same outcome. You also get to see the life on the island which gives you the impression that it is a place outta sync with evolution. An expedition with a military escort comes and that's when all the death and destruction with them starts. I found that entertaining to watch, there were a few 'jump' moments when things happen you don't expect, giggle moments when you think you know what's going to happen and it doesn't quite go as planned.John C. Reilly is the human star of this to me as a fighter shot down on the island, has managed to live there for 28 years and gets his chance to get out. Tom Hiddleston is the tracker brought along and is fun to watch, especially in the 'gas' scene against other monsters on the Island. Samuel L. Jackson was also interesting to watch as head of the military envoy who goes off the deep end with wanting nothing but revenge against Kong. the John Goodman is the 'kook' that gets government approval and gathers all of them, military and scientists, all together to go to the island (so he can prove he's not a kook, of course!). And then there is an assortment of other diverse cast members to keep the movie moving. Again, very good popcorn movie Saturday matinée fare.There are a few Easter eggs in Kong: Shull Island this I got immediately. They are preparing you for the future of Kong and others. But if you miss them during the film, it'll be very clear after the credits. Please stay. Kong: Skull Island is the beginning of these type of matinée popcorn fares, so just grab some friends, go to the theater and enjoy.",7,1,3,11 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not a Die Hard fan, But I loved this!
","So far in this galaxy ... on the USA news and entertainment shows ... this version of 'Star Wars' is always referred to as 'for the fans'. I am not a die hard fan. I saw bits and pieces of the original Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi...I paid more attention to the new versions 1 and 2 but this one....now, this one is the one to see.For me, it put everything together and allows me to GO BACK to the original Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi and appreciate it more..not only appreciate them, but really understand them.I really loved this film, the look, the feel, the battles. As with all the other reviewers here..there seems to be a lot left in regards to some of the 'drama-love-acting' scenes but WHO CARES! I kinda understood what I was seeing - two older teens/young adults being torn into major pieces with their emotions - believe you me - I didn't expect Shakespeare between the two - the actors carried it off with as much maturity you can have while in love and in the middle of an adult world that was falling madly apart.But those scenes were not so bad that it ruined the film. You do wash over them pretty quickly for there is SO much more going on that envelops you. Excellent entertainment!",10,3,9,21 May 2005
Ray," I am ambivalent, to say the least.
","I saw Ray when it first came out. Why? Partly, because of the advertising hype, secondly because I just loved the heck outa Ray Charles's music. But not being around when his biggest things in music and his life happened, I wanted to learn more about the man's life. And in this film, I did. His addiction to drugs was something I didn't know, and the film let us know.But here's the thing, while this was a decent autobiographical film...I cannot say it was a 'great' film. I've seen 'Malcolm X' and was blown away. Same with 'What's Love Got To Do With It' and 'Bird'. The performances of each of those films was outstanding. I wasn't just drawn into the main characters in those films - who did incredible jobs - but to those around them as well. That helps make a picture to me.I felt that at some parts of this film was shallow and heavy handed for emotional appeal. And yes, I'll admit at certain parts of the film I almost fell asleep. And the film was too long. And the film left out several 'other' important details of Ray Charles life that would have made the film flow better. The film got 'choppy' to me in certain parts. And the film seemed to end with a whimper, not a bang - certain parts, including the ending played like a tacked on 'Lifetime' cable network movie to me. I expect more outa cinema.So -- where does my ambivalence come in? With Jamie Foxx's performance. Overall, he did -- okay. Not Denzel Washington's Malcolm X or Angela Bassett's Tina Turner's spectacular, but...okay.Sorry folks, but to me, there were several points in the film where I saw Jamie Foxx's interpretation of Ray Charles, and in others - thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting - he 'looked' like Ray Charles. But I paid attention to the ... acting. An actor has to make you believe he IS the character he is playing. Not make a caricature of the character. Did I believe Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes -- sometimes no.Did Jamie Foxx deserve a Golden Globe? You betcha. Does he deserve an Oscar...? Depends on who's he's up against. He's got a few major competitors there, and he might just edge them out. But then again...maybe not. If Jamie Foxx doesn't win, I will not stand up and say 'he was robbed'. I wont particularly feel that he had been.This was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story. A 'great' autobiographical film of the late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere out there, I feel there IS a great film about Ray Charles just waiting to be made, and an actor that will blow you completely away in doing so.",7,6,11,30 January 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Sometimes, we all just don't agree.
","Last week, I had seen 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn't understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.
In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't original -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor anyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes you're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.First I thought, I might not be a big 'prison' entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is 'Birdman of Alcatraz' (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with 'The Green Mile' (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO's 'Oz' which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you're wondering, 'Reservoir Dogs' is another.)The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn't like 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King', I find myself here at 'The Shawshank Redemption', and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.All things are not wonderful to all people.And that's....a good thing.",3,6,16,25 December 2003
Shrek," A Film I expected to hate, but is one of the best films ever!
","This is one of the best films, ever! Ya gotta understand, with all the media-marketing hype and the terms 'family oriented' and 'Kids Film' I grew to dislike this film, without seeing it. That was until I saw it all the way through for the first time on cable tv. Lesson learned: ignore the hype, view for yourself, make up your own mind.That's when I found out, this is a wonderful film for children, families and adults. Smart, witty and funny, a brilliant re-tread of fairy tales that will live on for a long time, to be included with all those 'other' well-known timeless fairy tales.Shrek the Ogre, as voiced by Mike Myers was wonderful. He had all the elements, kids like. He's gross, he's loud, he's green and ugly. But he also possessed many traits adults liked, he was valiant and he had a heart. Everything a movie hero is made up of!I'm with everyone here as I cannot stop loving Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy. He should have won an Oscar for this. His vocal comedic stylings with this animation was brilliant, you cannot help but love Donkey.Princess Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz, was also wonderful and who could forget, Lord Farquaad voiced by the ever talented John Lithgow. I cannot tell you how hard I laughed throughout this film...and I loved the ending...I loved the 'twist' of Princes Fiona and how, at least in this telling of the beautiful Princess fairy-tale story, beauty and love is in the eyes of the beholder.This film is a Dreamworks animation division triumph. Mr. Katzenberg out did himself in producing this one, an excellent choice and project well done. The Animation was superb. For those who don't believe me, take a look at 'Donkey' during the film, or Lord Farquaad's hair for example. This type of Computer Animation is so 'scary', you just KNOW real actors now have a 'shelf life' and in the coming decades, this technology will advance and become a Hollywood norm. Good or bad as this 'shelf life' for real actors may be, I am just commenting on what a great accomplishment, great entertainment and I hope as the technology progresses, it is used 'with' and not 'instead of.'Anyone who hates this film, in my humble view, has a personal problem with it..because as far as an achievement, it is a great one, it is a spectacular film for all audiences -- loaded with adult jokes but in keeping it in line for children, which keeps everyone interested and very much entertained. Bravo!",10,1,2,28 November 2002
Any Given Sunday," One of the most entertaining of the genre
","The one thing I like about Oliver Stone is that he can put together one of the best ensemble casts for films today. (Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson are also good at it, Altman being the best) This is one of those films that has football and story that is very interesting and this film has something for everyone.I've gotta say that every time I look at this film, I do snicker a bit for I moved out to Los Angeles, California around the time they lost their two football teams. One of the characters here played well by Cameron Diaz, I am sure is loosely based on the LA Rams owner of that time. (I say loosely because Cameron's character's claim to ownership fame was via her father passing the team onto her and her degrees. For the Rams, well, let's say, Joe Esterhaus should have based his movie 'Showgirls' on her.)I guess there are a lot of 'little insider things' like that that Oliver Stone threw in this film. But the bottom line is, I am not an avid football watcher, or an avid film goer for sports films...but I like watching this film!! You get interested, keeps you interested.I like Al Pacino as the dry, dusty coach who should have been named the head of the team. I like the showing of the marketing dogs behind the new team star, played by Jamie Foxx and I liked the on screen rivalry between Foxx and LL Cool J. I like the story with Dennis Quaid as the vet who get's injured and his wife played by Lauren Holly who just can't let go of all the glitz that came with him once being the top, I like the showing of the women with their claws in these foot ballers, I like Cameron Diaz who is in over her head and thinks a college education as an administrator in this game is everything and her quest for dollars, I like Charleton Heston's cameo role, I like Ann-Margaret as the 'I don't care what ya do' mom to Cameron Diaz, I like Clifton Davis as the Mayor, I liked watching J.T. and Jim Brown and all the other American Football players on the field (T.O...can you believe it???), I like the party girls and the high class hookers (Elizabeth Berkley), I like James Woods as the team doctor getting his 'due' as part of the team, I love Thomas Jane as the booth coach and hey....I really liked John C. McGinnley as the sports writer. A good ensemble cast...in parts that aren't what they are typically known for but come together here under Stones direction well.You get foot ball from all sides from this film - the field, the administration, the personal, the injuries etc. And please, watch this film uncut and with good sound. The sound on this film is to die for! It is an ambitious work and it works big time.",8,1,2,13 September 2006
Iron Man," More than I expected...
","Iron Man surprised me for it was more than I expected - it actually went more for the 'background story' of Tony Stark, than the easy way out as most summer blockbusters of Marvel/DC comics to the big screen - lot of action and little story. Iron Man is one of those comics though that has a story to tell first out and I'm glad this development chose this route. This I found most refreshing and entertaining - leaving the door open for another installment that CAN be more action packed.Robert Downey Jr., is a good cast for Tony Stark - showing you how womanizing, alcohol-drinking, egotistical, M.I.T. Magna Cume Laude Tony Stark develops into Iron Man. Gweneth Paltrow was ...okay - not much to crow about as Pepper Potts ...anyone of a number of actresses could have done the same. The actor they SHOULD be talking about is Jeff Bridges. He did quite the bang up job for this installment - showing how corporate hierarchy works and how he intended to keep his star shining in the pecking order - internationally...devilishly good. A very entertaining film.",9,1,3,4 May 2008
Ben-Hur," One of the Top Five Films of All Time!
","Anyone want to know how to make a darned good EPIC remake? Then this is the film to see. William Wyler made an epic, a film that is exciting, violent, heartfelt film. Make no mistake, it is the story of two childhood friends, one gets drunk with power and the other who was a Jewish Prince gets thrown into a life of hardship though his boyhood 'friend'. But he has faith and keeps on going. The ultimate battle to beat all battles, to settle the score...is at the Chariot race and that is a sight to behold.Films like Ben-Hur will NEVER get greenlighted today and if it did, too much CGI and not enough of what Director Wyler and old Hollywood was good at. The actors, well, they are to die for. Excellent acting. And let me share with you my favorite part...(tee-hee) when Pilate holds up his hankerchief to start the chariot race, plays with the racers and audience - he's very smug ya know..then the WAY he finally drops it. Who couldn't tell how he'd eventually turn out, hmmmmmmm? There is nothing more I can add that others have said. This film is near and dear to me and for my vote -- is one of the top five films of all time. I never tire of watching this film, I find something new in it every time, its done that well.This is an epic remake, something else that Hollywood has trouble doing -- to remake a film on this scale that finds new audiences year after year, after year. Brilliant, wonderful, every bit of it. A must, must see. Just plain excellent!",10,37,49,20 April 2003
Signs," Please, wake up 'horror' fans!
","I...um... just saw this film. Let me preface this by saying I wasn't a fan of 'The Sixth Sense' for after the first two minutes, I was bored silly. I couldn't get into 'Unbreakable' at all. My lovely friends dragged me to this and I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed for I didn't expect much, and I didn't get much. I love horror films that make you wonder, grab you and make you think. Special Effects and make up are nice, but a good frightening film without them are worth their weight in gold. This isn't one of them, for this fan of the genre. Unless you're just getting into 'scary' films, or are under 8 and hardly ever saw a scary film, then this is the film for you. I want to be challenged, not treated as if I got a labotomy yesterday. If this film gets any 'above the line' Academy Award nominations, then the Academy is rigged. I HATE this 'polite horror' trend that seems to be rearing its head in filmmaking these days..or 'politically correct horror' as I am labeling it. Come on people, get some guts, again. Demand better.Plus I was really disgusted that this was explained away with the subliminal message of 'religion' is the only truth. I am a big fan of Religiously themed pictures as well and this makes me want to slap the face of the writer, this is so shallow work. Shame on those who think this is one of the best pictures of the year!!! To me, this ranks up there with 'Glitter' which is not all that bad, now I've seen this.",8,0,3,8 September 2002
X2: X-Men United," A better than the first evolutionary kinda sequel
","I just got back from seeing X-2 - X-Men United. Knowing it was a sequel, I had the sequel is going to rehash kinda thing in my mind. Not this movie. It was done where if you saw the first one -- great..if not -- great!  Many reviewers here have already told enough about the plot of this film so I wont add more to what they have said regarding that plot. I'm only going to write about how this film made me feel..and that was fantastic. This sequel took chances, had a strong message and didn't back down from you knowing who was 'good' and who was 'bad'..on both sides of the coin. Yes, here is another early summer 2003 entry that wants you to 'think', well after you leave the theater. And that is...think more than about the 'action' and the 'cool special effects' the mutants do. Excellent film.",10,0,0,26 May 2003
The Ringer," Lord, Have Mercy.
","The Ringer is a film that tries to be silly and sentimental at the same time and because its going one way then the other, it's not at all completely satisfying.This film has moments - moments of major stupidity, very light humor, very light heart. But it's all over the place. Up and down. Not quite uneven, but not quite con-jointed either. I'm not going over the story again, many others have already done that, but the gist of it is that an office worker gets talked into entering the special Olympics to pay off debts associated with him, and one incurred by a gambling family member.I guess if you're going to do a film with a theme of a healthy person trying to win a Special Olympics you only have two choices: raunchy, side splitting comedy or all heart. The middle ground loses something. At points you feel the film wants to 'go there' but then pulls back so that it doesn't 'offend'. I say, 'offend' or...be completely heartwarming. This film suffers from 'political correctness' because honestly, who WOULD want to pay to see a completely healthy person fix a Special Olympics.As I watch films like 'Animal House', 'American Pie', 'There's Something About Mary', etc., those films had that 'edge' - slob/raunchiness that just made you fall in love with them and you are able to watch over and over and laugh at things you know you're snot supposed to laugh at. This film is lacking what those films had. Try again.",5,3,6,21 December 2006
Amélie," Trés Bien!
","What a wonderful, delightful film! It has been over a decade that I have been so excited about a foreign film as I have about this one. It's delightful, the story is fun and the lead actress is adorable to watch as she does good for those around her....and finally finds love, for herself! You'll cheer for her and those around her, and the film is sprinkled with wonderful points animation that ACTUALLY advance the story, not that they are just there for CGI sake.
Highly recommended, a wonderful 'chick' film that is also great for 'guys' too!",10,0,2,9 February 2003
The Producers," One of the Best Films of All Time (Spoilers included)
","I will make no bones by saying this is one of my favorite films of all time. It's brilliant, ingenious and pokes fun at something that wasn't  funny. I'll repeat that to make a point: IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY. Ya gotta ask yourself, why did the audience find it funny?When this film came out, I was no where near an age to see it. I actually saw it for the first time in the 1980's and I laughed my butt off.The films premise is easy -- a once great Broadway Theater producer is now barely able to get a show together and has resorted to bilking little old ladies out of their money to finance the small theater plays he still can do.In walks a meek but nervous accountant who discovers a slight financial error that, if done on a larger scale could make millions for the ones doing it. Of course the has been producer jumps on the idea and enlists the meek accountant to help. Just one problem, what could be the most tasteless, horrid play one can do that would upset theater-patrons, major critics and anyone who would get a whiff of it? A theater play that would close in one night so the Producer and Accountant can keep the millions of dollars they got by over extending the profits from investors?!?!The play they find is 'Springtime For Hitler' and it fits the bill. How horrid, who could sit though a glorification of Hitler and his life?!?! Not only were they going to produce this play, they needed the worse people to stage it. They sign the worse choreographer/director and the worse actors. In their minds, there is no way this can do anything but flop.Everything is in place but what happens, instead of offending folks, this becomes a comedic triumph! The toast of broadway! Which means, the Producer and the Accountant committed fraud because they financed the picture with investors that they promised over 100% of the play. Their scheme backfires and they know they will go to jail.This film is so brilliant on all levels! Considering it was done in the 60's, it holds up wonderfully today with striking parallels (Remember the dot.com industry and the greed of Corporate CEO's???) And what about Hitler...how can that be funny to anyone?!?!?The Producers -- It's about greed, its about women being seen as nothing but objects, its about the young not knowing history and playing it for a joke not knowing that's even more destructive than Hitler could ever be, its about comedy, its about homosexuality, its about the mind of a criminal and how jail as supposed to rehabilitate etc., etc., -- it has much to offend many, but it also reflects time. The best part of the film to me is even after they are convicted and in jail...and they promise they 'will never do it again'...then you see them in prison...doing it again!!! Brilliant.I find that younger people who see this movie for the first time hate it. I find that folks feel there's nothing funny about Hitler, and there ISN'T which is THE point of the film. How can something so horrible be so funny to audiences when it WASN'T MEANT TO BE -- but it DID. There is social commentary there, and very much of it. The writing is superb, many many references there. I really feel sorry for those who miss out on all of these elements.'The Producers' was done in a time when I feel 'films were films' very layered themes and elements not just dependent upon film production values. The Broadway play is a darn good updated version, but this film is 'The King'. Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder - the best.You're missing out on one of the greatest film comedies of all time in not ever seeing this one.",9,0,1,21 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Mr. Jackson -- take a bow. You more than deserve to.
","In my lifetime so far, the best films ever made, of all time were done such as:The Godfather, Part I The Original 'Star Wars' The Original 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' The Original 'Psycho' The Original 'The Exorcist' ...and more...And a whole host of others before my lifetime...and guess what!?!?I am happy to say I am glad I was alive and one of the first to see 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring', 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' and 'Lord of the Rings, Return of the King'.This last installment, was THE most brilliant and wonderful film I've ever seen in a long time. I am NOT going to give any spoilers or any information about the move for this is a movie everyone needs to see on the big screen at least once.The only pet-peeve? It is over 3 hours and I know theater owners are at a loss to run 'Intermissions' but this is one film that should make them reconsider. People didn't WANT to miss a second of this film and were squirming in their seats...but didn't get up! This film was THAT excellent, to risk bladder control!!Oh.... in the theater: people clapped, people screamed, people jumped, people cried. (And no, I was not at a Magic Johnson Theater presentation, but I wish I was, I bet those audiences went CRAZY!!!)It has been such a long time to see this in a theater...the real reactions of an audience who were so moved by entertainment so grand, so wonderful...so EPIC in this day and time.Oscar voters, take note. If this film doesn't win this year for 'Best Picture', there WILL be a riot. You cannot deny it this time. You just CAN'T!!!!!I hear Mr. Jackson's next venture is a remake of the classic 'King Kong'. Interesting choice but....don't worry, I'm already standing in line and waiting for that one too.An Excellent film that will last the ages....a ten out of ten.",10,0,0,20 December 2003
300," Visually Fascinating
","The one thing that will grab you from the start of '300' is that it is visually stunning in telling it's graphic tale. There's no way around how amazed you'll be at this interpretation of the battle. Then there is the story. A story that is left up to you to interpret whether these 300 Spartans were brave or just plain idiots to put their lives out in that way under their King. These warriors and their King were indeed products of their lives and environments - and this is a theme that is being told time and time again...without much new spin on it. That's the ideal of this film and a good one to observe at that.Much is being aid about 'eeeing the film, but in listening to the film, you are told a tale - a historical tale - but instead of the 'usual filming' that accompanies things of this nature, I was treated to a fascinating piece of art, ballet, music, strength. That is what makes this film heads above the rest in a graphic telling of a tale you know would not have the positive of endings - but an interpretation of what one thought might have been within the tale. And it was visually stunning of a feat to tell. I picked up very important details in this battle that fit the 'time' - primitive weapons (to our standards of today) but used skillfully and well and choreographed in a way on screen where you knew that's all these weapons could do in the battle situations presented. These were men who were born to die, so to speak and they knew their call. Frank Miller gives you his perspective of how graphically he envisioned such a tale.'300' isn't for everyone, and this graphic telling may have many cringe - but if you do watch, you cannot escape how visually stunning it is, how artful it has been done and how people will do what they need to do to save themselves, those they love - while others will do anything to be superior, take over everything and be more than what they think they are for fame, identification and power.",9,0,1,19 August 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The King of Comedies!
","The first time I saw this was on CBS at 11:30 on a Friday night. I had seen a few Monty Python shows on PBS, so I knew who they were, and I was very interested in seeing this.This film shows you just what all around comedy is all about.It starts during the opening credits and ends in a way you don't see coming. The songs are....memorable. The drawings/animation are imaginative for its time and the Monty Python troupe was at its shining best playing a host of characters from the days of King Arthur. If you don't laugh at this today, you have no funny bone! Many other reviewers here hit this film on the nose, there isn't much more to add to how brilliant this piece of work it.This is one of my all time favorites and is one of the top 10 films of all time.",10,117,160,18 May 2003
Sin City," What a Fantastic Film!
","I've have got to go on record to say that this was one under-rated film when it comes to the film industry patting itself on the back.Technologically speaking, this was a marvel. Creatively speaking, this was very creative. This is a rare film of bringing to film a mixture of elements together that makes you WANT to watch, and an ensemble of actors and actresses that make it work.Over a decade ago, Oliver Stone put together his version of 'Natural Born Killers'. Although it was only a fraction of Quentin Tarrintino's original tale, it was the film itself that made me take notice. Every element known at that time was used to bring to the screen a frightening tale. I feel the same about this one.A mixture of film noir, live comics, color, action and story, this was one of the films that was a refreshing change in what has been placed out there. Violent, you betcha. Adult themes? Above and Beyond. A film homage to the comic itself.To put something like this on the screen you need to cast the appropriate actors....and the casting, for the most part, was the best. Bruce Willis was great, the usually annoying to me Jessica Alba did a good job here, Clive Owen is just a buzz to watch on the screen, Benicio Del Toro shows why he is a breakout actor...supporting roles of folks like Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett (who'll show you he's just not another 'pretty boy for the movies'), Brittney Murphy, Nicki Katt, Carla Gugino (a very underrated actress!), Jamie King (just wonderful!), Powers Boothe (chillng!), Elijah Wood (scary!), Michael Madsen were all the bomb.But the two that will definitely stick with you are Nick Stahl and Mickey Roarke in his best performance in YEARS. These actors and their characters were the best and had me on the edge of my seat.The only actor that wasn't that exciting to me was Rosario Dawson - could be because she didn't have much to do in this one....and I kept thinking of a parrot every time she came on screen and not about the tough character leader she was supposed to be.But even with that, this film was still the best. A must not miss for anyone interested in film, a gem for the fans of the comic series.",9,1,2,5 February 2006
Donnie Darko," Amazing!
","'Donnie Darko' is one of those films you'd say to yourself, 'I'm not looking at that' but because nothing else is on, you catch it. You'll think you know what's going on. You think you'll know what it's about. Don't pre-judge, just take a look. When you do, you'll kick yourself for not knowing about it sooner.This little film was done well. It is a smart film, I really liked the elements of it and the theme of it. Many reviewers said enough about this film so I wont add more story elements to it, all I will add to their wonderful reviews is for you to watch it, at least once.
This is a film where the writer/director will go on to do either more great things and be a strong writer and/or director in this decade, or as a few others in his shoes prior did, get the old 'Hollywood Shaft'. I hope its the former and not the latter.I recommend this film highly. Go rent it, or catch it on Cable. You'll be glad you did.",10,2,4,15 May 2003
Goodfellas," Crime doesn't pay, but this film is beautiful
","A story told about a man who 'always wanted to be a gangster'.The direction, the acting and the storytelling of this man, Henry Hill's Life was done beautifully. He was a violent gangster who you see wasn't born that way, but hung around the right folks and became a product of the environment.Watching the relationships between Henry Hill (played wonderfully by Ray Liotta), Jimmy (played by the great Robert DeNiro) and Tommy (played brilliantly by Joe Pesci)were amazing to watch. Here you see friendships develop and over time, deteriorate. This is not a film that glorifies crime, it tells a story of how crimes were committed and what happened to many of those involved. You know much of what the main characters do are wrong, but you feel for a few of them - and that what makes this film beautiful.A fine piece of work, wonderful acting, a kick butt storyline augmented by the best music score put together in the the movies today. Yes, I am a fan of the music that was chosen to augment this film from start to finish. It is RARE to take music and have it interwoven through a major motion picture to help drive the story. I never listened to the piano exit of 'Layla' the same ... ever again.Excellent. Bravo Marty. I appreciate your work. :)",10,0,1,19 March 2005
Jurassic Park," Gotta Give it a Ten -- Eight for the Film and Two for getting it Done!
","This film is one of those films that was so HARD to get to the screen so finally seeing it on the screen, made me excited, happy and proud for all who worked on it.I read the book, seemed like a slam dunk for a movie, but Universal Pictures was going through SO much at the time, as was Steven Speilberg that when it finally got through, even with all the budget cuts, writing/script problems, cut scenes and problems and background DRAMA...heck, this ranks as one of the top 25 pictures of the Century.I loved it. Sure, it coulda been more bloody, it coulda been more adult, but it turned out fine and for everything that was put upon it, as close to a novel as you can get in Hollywood...and as many of us movie buffs know, we've seen a good novel ruined when gotten to the screen. This one, did more than okay, it did great.For its time, state of the art concepts were used -- heck I wanted to see more dinosaurs and gosh, the ones they did conceive were great...but why did Samuel L. Jackson have to die?!?!?! (a joke here!)Great film, excellent effort, excellent business skills and work to get it done, One of the more entertaining, CGI at its beginning best.
Great entertainment.",10,2,3,18 February 2003
The Simpsons Movie," A summer movie that lives up to the 'hype'
","They hype of this movie is: 'The Simpsons on the big screen'. And that's just what I got, The Simpsons on the big screen -- and it was fun, summer entertainment.You are not going to see anything new - in fact, that is the beauty of the film. They're not attempting to do more than what you normally see if you're a Simpson's fan. To be honest, that was very refreshing that they DIDN'T try to 'remake the wheel' or spruce everyone up to be ...box office. Unless this is your very first time EVER seeing The Simpsons, you know how everyone is going to act and re-act - and they do so here on the big screen. And it does work.The story? Typical Simpsons' for this time but it is funny as the Simpsons get -- and that made for quite a few jokes in the film. They poked fun at us the audience as well as popular culture, and wrapped it around a simple story. Surprisingly very effective.My complaints? I've seen 'Itchy and Scratchy' do MUCH worse on free TV, I missed Kang and Kodos, and of course, Sideshow Bob. But in the light plot of this movie, that wasn't bad at all. Maybe I'll see them in the NEXT movie, ya know? If not, watching them every week on TV for all these years wont mean I'll miss them that much either. That's how seamless this big screen movie is right into the weekly series.A fun time at the movies with 'The Simpsons' doing what they do in Springfield best.",8,1,5,28 July 2007
Dodgeball," The most stupidly funny film you just may enjoy
","When this first came out, I had no intention of seeing it. I am not a big fan of Ben Stiller, nor Vince Vaughn and the marketing of the film turned me off more. But when this recently appeared on cable, I came in the middle of the unrated version -- and had to see it from the beginning.This is a silly, fun film. Ben Stiller was actually cast well, and Vince Vaughn had the straightest deadpan character with the funniest lines...sure most of the humor is sophomoric, sure the plot is formulmatic...but it worked.I loved this film because...I hated Dodgeball as a kid. This really blew up all of those childhood memories and made them hilarious. That's why I enjoyed this film. Then..there were the cameos and surprises that really were unexpected and fun.This is not a cerebral film...but when you get in the mood for silly fun, Dodgeball is at the top of the heap.",8,0,1,31 August 2005
The Island," It was a nice start...
","The Island is a film about the not so distant future when a corporate minded entrepreneur finds a way to keep you alive longer than you should be. This was a great idea, and the film started out pretty well.I really liked the first 45 minutes or so of this film. It had you curious, showed excitement...the story seemed to be going somewhere. So where did it loose it for me? When the two escaped from the situation they were in. It stopped being interesting and started becoming patchy. I had a lot of questions about how 'quickly' the two escapees adapted.Then there were the excessive action scenes that Michael Bay, the director, is famous for but seemed misplaced in several areas. This could have been quite the cool sci-fi film more than going for the big budget blow up film. All of the elements were there. It just seemed to go overboard once the two subjects left the facility.Scarlett Johanson and Ewan McGreggor are the two subjects of this film and they were cast fine. Actually, I had no problem with ANY of the casting, everyone fit. Sean Bean was wonderful as well. The problem was with how the story unfolded, where the action was and when and a few plot holes that could have been easily taken care of.Is this film awful? No. Is it bad? Not ... really. It's just one of those films that has so much potential and didn't grow where it should have grown -- and that is in the sci-fi realm.What a great concept this film has. Loved the first 45 minutes of production designing. It could have been along the lines of sci-fi society films like THX 1138 or 2001 in which you were presented a future society that the human race wished to expand and the means of which human and in some cases technology played a part. The Island poses another theory that is very plausible as well.Maybe they didn't want to make a 'thinking man's' film and wanted to go for a 'popcorn' film instead. A 'thinking man's' film elements are there...but so was the 'popcorn' - and that's too bad.",7,0,0,5 August 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," They ain't even old timey!
","Gotta tell you, I fell in love with this film. This was not love at first sight, this is a film you can have a relationship with and within that relationship you'd find it endearing, loving and without expecting it, you'd fall in love with it. I am a Cohen Brother's film fan and almost all of their films had the same effect on me. Ya can't immediately fall in love with their films, they take time to enjoy and find out how loving they can be.(Spoilers?) This film is loosely based on Homer's: The Odyssey. (And not Homer Simpson either folks!) Once you know that basic story you begin to find out just how endearing this film really is. Three ex-cons were 'conned' into breaking out of jail and go on quite an adventure. Believable? Hmmmm, maybe. Unbelievable? Hmmmm, maybe. The key line of this film is told right in the beginning by the old man riding the rail when he tells them that they are seeking a treasure, that they will get it but it will not be the one they seek. But that is just what makes this fun. The music is to die for, and to be honest, you don't have to like 'bluegrass'. It has that PLUS other styles as well that adds to the richness of the adventure. George Clooney, whom I don't usually like, turns in a good performance here as well as his 'partners in crime'. The one liners in this film are fun and the actors carry them off well, such as the one I used to summarize the film. Quirky, silly, funny, strange can all be used to sum this film up.One problem I had was that I felt the ending of the film wasn't that great. You could have actually ended the film 15 minutes earlier and it would have been just as fine. It's worth a look...or two, believe you me, you'll find that over a few viewings you'll see it for what it is, a very craftyly done adaptation of an age old story. Like me, you may just grow to like it and hold it dear!",10,3,4,16 May 2003
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Disappointing
","This is a film that could have been a laugh riot - and made quite the nice poke of fun for NASCAR and that circuit in general.But this falls WAY flat - it leaves 'funny parody' and becomes a series of half baked one liners looking for a movie.The theme is interesting enough - Ricky Bobby was born in the back seat of a fast car which means he was practically born to race. HIs daddy leaves, his momma raises him, he has always wanted to 'go fast'. He has a BFFL (Best friend for life) who supports Ricky and they're in a pit crew. But RIcky gets a chance to compete when the lazy driver he's pitting for goes out to eat a chicken and doesn't care about finishing the race - and Ricky Bobby shows everyone what he can do. Eventually his BFFL gets to drive too - they create the 'shake and Bake' and 'slingshot' that puts Ricky Bobby on top. He gets all that comes with his new fame, a lazy well kept wife and sponsorships. Until a racer comes from France and takes over the winning pole from Ricky Bobby, and his BFFL takes over everything else from Ricky Bobby. This could have been a nice hokey little film but instead, it just goes down, down, down. Silly routines, a neurotic escapade that doesn't make sense, cameos that have no reason to be there in the first place, and the gay references that aren't really funny...flat, flat..FLAT.All of this flatness could be because all those involved didn't know enough about NASCAR to properly spoof it. Or maybe there's stuff on the editing room floor that is funnier than the stuff that made it on the film. But to be honest, there ARE elements in this film you want the jokes to pay off for...and all I can say is that they just don't.In other words....I am STILL waiting for a good, funny NASCAR spoof.",5,2,4,24 June 2007
The Godfather," A film that will stand up to time
","When you think of the top 25 films of all time, they have one thing in common. You could have seen them when they first came out or your children's children can be viewing them, and they will still give the same long lasting impression. They may encourage you/your children to get into film or entertainment, they make you think. They keep you talking well after you've seen the film not once, not twice, but for a long time. There is always something new you're discovering about it, each time you speak of it. The Godfather is one of those rare films.I was too young to see it once it came out, but I read alot of movie magazines at the time about it as well as grabbing a copy of the Mario Puzio book. My first full length view of 'The Godfather' was on...yep, you guessed it, the 'Z' channel in Los Angeles in the 1980's. It grabbed me and never let go.The Godfather has everything in it that a movie going public would like to see, and the rare thing is -- it's all in one movie. It deals with family, the relationship of sons and their placement IN a family, it has violence -- that's for sure, mystery, romance, corruption, suspense. It has a story, surprises. The costumes are wonderful, the scenery and sets are wonderful.This was 1972 and NOTHING like this was put together/filmed at the time. The early 70's gave alot of film makers chances, some good, some spectacular -- and most of all a legend for future film makers and entertainers to look at, hold in esteem and copy (which is the best form of flattery.)Don't get me wrong, there are many 'gangster-type' films out there that kick-butt (thanks to James Cagney, Edward G. and a host of others) , but this one...flowed. It really isn't all about the violence, but legacies, how violence begats violence and a look inside a 'family' maternal and extended and what they would do to survive. The rivalries between 'families'. This is why 'The Godfather' ranks in the top 7 of the best movies of all time among the majority. Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert DuVall and an ecclectic, well cast group of actors and actresses and Production crew brought this to life. Regardless of how YOU may feel personally about the 'portrayal' of the ethnicity of the characters, this film MAKES you wonder, makes you feel, makes you angry, makes you cry, makes you respond.The Godfather is one of the best films ever made.",10,1,4,2 July 2003
