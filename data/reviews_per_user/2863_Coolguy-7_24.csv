Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great movie for anyone who has ever been a Star Wars fan.
","I first saw this movie at a local theater.  It shows Anikan Skywalker (later named Darth Vader) as a little boy who works as a slave for a mosquito-like creature.  I thought it was a pretty good movie, but my grandma thought it was weird.  There were some pretty weird characters on there such as the aliens who live in an underwater world.  I would recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan.",Null,0,1,17 December 1999
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," The toons and the live actors united
","I love this movie. I think I first saw it when I was about 9 years old.  I thought this was a wonderful form of live action and animation. I have seen a lot of films with live action and animation such as 'Mary Poppins' and 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' and not to mention Disney's very first series of the early 20's, the 'Alice Comedies' in which a little girl is in a cartoon world.  But this is a modernized form of it in which they probably used computers.  But enough about the animation!  I thought Bob Hoskins was wonderful as the boozehound Eddie Valient who was hired by cartoon producer R.K. Maroon to solve a mystery.  The title character, Roger was hilarious. And let's not forget Baby Herman (he's a baby, but has a grown man's voice). We also have the different cartoon stars like Yosemite Sam, Mickey Mouse, and Betty Boop (who was jeleous of Roger's wife Jessica because she was in color).  I liked the scene with Donald and Daffy Duck playing the pianos. It was so funny.  This is a must see film for everyone, but some scens may give small children nightmares like seeing the evil Judge Doom.",Null,0,0,4 February 2000
Erin Brockovich," Okay, but not one of my favorites
","I recently watched this movie that I had borrowed from my grandmother.  I liked it, but it wasn't one of my favorites.  While it had a large amount of comedy, some parts were not too interesting to me.  Erin Brokovich sure had a bad mouth.  She said the 'F' word in just about every sentence she used (that explains why this movie is rated R).  One thing that is interesting is that the guy who plays Brokovich's lawyer/boss is the same actor who portrays Daddy Warbucks in the 1980's musical 'Annie.'  My sister pointed it out because the voice was so familiar.  I didn't believe it myself, but as soon as we looked on the back of the video cover, his last name was in parenthesis by the character whom he portrayed.  He sure has changed since 'Annie.'  He has a little more skin on his face and has hair. If I were a teacher and could grade the producers of this film, I would give them a B.",Null,0,1,22 December 2000
Meet the Parents," Definitely a classic
","I just saw this movie today and I loved it.  When I saw the previews for it on TV, I thought it looked quite stupid.  That just proves that you can't make a proper judgment on a movie just by seeing its previews.   Male Nurse, Greg(or Gaylord)Focker is engaged to teacher Pamela Martha Byrnes.  I liked the scene at the beginning of the film where the children at Pam's school keep screwing up on the letters that they use trying to spell out: MARRY ME PAM (on one try, they spell out: MARRY ME MAP).  After Pam agrees, Greg has to 'meet the parents.'  The mother is just fine and likes Greg, but Jack(played by Danny DeVito)the father is a real jerk.  I didn't like him too much.  One part I found funny was where Greg was eating dinner with Pam and her parents.  He brought out a bottle of wine for them to drink.  He popped the cork, which hit  a vase that contained the ashes of Jack's mother.  The vase breaks and Jinks the Himalyan cat rushes over to the ashes and urinates in them.  The acting in this film was wonderful.  So if you're a fan of comedy such as this, you should watch this movie.  It's definitely a classic.",Null,0,0,30 May 2001
As Good as It Gets," One of the best movies ever made
","I absolutely love this film.  It can get sort of long, but it's still great. This is one of those movies that contains a blend of drama and comedy.  I enjoy Jack Nicholson's portrayal as the anti-social Melvin Udall.  Another Jack Nicholson film I saw was 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'  His personality is different in that movie than in this one.  In Cuckoo's Nest, he was more open minded and showed his fellow inmates the joys of life.  The one in Cuckoo's Nest would have probably made friends with Simon the gay artist. He would have been a lot more polite with waitress Carol Connely. To top it all off, he would have been a lot friendlier and would have made several friends.  The Jack Nicholson in this film, however, would have been nasty to the inmates at the mental hospital.  He would not have wanted anything to do with them.  So do you think Melvin Udall will become a better man?  Well, watch this movie and find out.",Null,0,0,19 December 2000
The Mummy," Good action/comedy
","I saw this movie recently and thought it was pretty good.  It had good acting by Brendan Frasier (who was also in 'George of the Jungle').  There were, however, some scenes that we could have done without.  These were all the scenes in which the scarab beetles crawled into people's bodies and ate them alive.  I don't think that scarab beetles really do that (or at least I hope not).  Nevertheless, this is a good film and I think that any archaeologist would enjoy it.",Null,0,0,7 August 2000
Dead Poets Society," Wonderful work by Williams
","I remember seeing this movie in my American Literature class.  It was really great.  The actors were wonderful, especially Robin Williams as the college English professor.  One part I don't understand is when one of the students played a joke on the dean.  He pretended to make the phone ring and answered it.  He then said it was God.  The dean took him into his office and literally gave him a paddling on the butt.  Don't you think college students are a little old to be treated like that?  Besides, wasn't that unlawful or had no laws about that yet been passed in the 50's?  Watching this movie also taught me one thing.  It was a famous word (actually two) called 'Carpe Diem.'  I had heard of that little phrase for several years.  Now I finally knew what it meant, 'seize the day.'  A similar incident was used in the movie 'Mrs. Doubtfire.' (also starring Williams)  Mrs. Doubtfire spilled her dentures in her water and said 'Carpe Dentum; seize the teeth.'  This is truly every English teacher's movie and I recommend it to all of them.",Null,1,2,1 June 2000
Home Alone," He made his family disappear
","I first saw this movie when I took three of my friends to it for my 10th birthday.  I thought it was really funny when the burglars, Marv and Harry fell into every booby trap that Kevin had set up.  Kevin was the youngest kid in his family (not including cousins, aunts, uncles, or grandparents). His older brother Buzz would always pick on him and his Uncle Frank was just a jerk.  That night, Kevin wished for his family to disappear.  By a strange coincidence,or was it just the fact that the family was in a rush and just plain forgot him?, it came true.  Then two burglars come over to rob the place when Kevin sets up his booby traps.  Many of these scenes looked quite painful such as the scene where Kevin shoots Harry in the genitals with a BB gun and when Marv steps on a nail (let's hope he got his tetanus shot).  So for this holiday season, forget about old movies like Bing Crosby's 'White Christmas' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' and pop this video into your VCR. You and your whole family will love this film.",Null,1,2,18 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," My favorite film of the series
","I remember back when I was in kindergarten, my parents bought the original 'Star Wars' Trilogy set.  I watched this (and the two previous 'Star Wars' films)with them.  At first I thought that the aliens in the movie were real. I thought the characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, R2D2,etc really existed.  You would think that a kindergartener would get scared of all these aliens.  I wasn't!  The only thing that I was a little scared of was the Emporer (he certainly looks scary, doesn't he?). Another scary sight was seeing Darth Vader's face after Luke takes off his mask. We discover that Darth Vader's head looks like an egg. Well, over a decade has passed and this has really gotten to be a classic film that I enjoy watching.  This is sure to delight people for many generations to come.",Null,0,0,29 March 2000
Liar Liar," Jim Carrey turns honest
","I recently saw this movie for the first time on ABC.  I thought it was funny.  In the movie, Jim Carrey plays Fletcher Reed, a divorced lawyer whose son named Max wishes that he could tell nothing but the truth for just one day.  Well the wish comes true.  Unfortunately for Fletcher it causes a lot of problems.  He can no longer keep secrets, which causes him to embarass himself.  For example, he tells a woman in the park just exactly what he thinks of her and she slaps him.  Later, his son, ex-wife, and her future husband are on their way to Boston.  Good old Fletcher comes to stop them with some comic tactics like hiding in a suitcase and using some wheelstairs to take him to the departing airplane.  Eventually, a bunch of luggage falls on him leaving him injured.  Max, ex-wife, and the future husband come out of the plane.  Fletcher tells his son just how much he wishes he could've spent time with him but was just too busy with his job to do so.  The mother asks him if he really means it. Max says, 'Of course, mom, he has to tell the truth!'  Reed tells Max that the wish wore off and things are back to normal.  At Max's next birthday, the lights temporarily go off and when they turn on again, Reed and his ex-wife are kissing.  Reed asks Max if he wished for them to get back together.  Max says, 'No,dad, I wished for some new rollerblades!'  This is a wonderful movie that everyone should watch.",Null,0,0,3 March 2000
Good Will Hunting," One of Damon and Affleck's best performances
","I borrowed this movie from my grandma one time.  As I sat down to watch it, I noticed that it had a lot of the 'F' word in  it.  Still, however, it is a wonderful film and I recommend it to all my friends and family.  The actors were great, but I really liked Robin William's performance as the counselor. Williams always seems to be a great actor.  Aside from Williams, Matt Damon was a great performer as the college custodian.Don't take it from me, see this film for yourself.",Null,2,5,16 October 1999
Back to the Future Part III," Marty and Doc in the Wild West
","This is the third and final story to the 'Back to the Future' series.  I can really say that this one is without a doubt my favorite of the three.  In this story, Doc Brown goes back to 1885 Hill Valley (and later Marty).  In this film, the bad guy is outlaw Beauford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, Biff's great-grandfather.  He gets things mixed up as well as Biff like when he says 'I'll hunt you down like a duck!' to Marty.  One of his colleagues tells him that it's 'Hunt you down like a dog.'  One part that I thought was funny was the scene at the square dance.  Marty picks up an empty pie plate that has 'Frisbee' printed on it.  He then says 'Frisbee! Far out!'  His Irish ancestors, Seamus (pronounced Shay-Mus) and Maggie look at each other and Seamus says 'What was the meaning of that?'  Maggie replies 'It was right in front of him!'  After Beauford get arrested, Marty goes back to the year 1985 and the train destroys the time machine on the Eastwood Ravine, changed from the Clayton Ravine after Marty goes back in time. (Marty told the people of 1885 that his name was Clint Eastwood.)  At the end of the movie, Clara Clayton (the woman who Doc fell in love with) and Doc Brown are married and have two children of their own named Jules and Vern.(Wonder where those names came from)",Null,0,0,9 January 2000
Men in Black II," Better than the original
","Normally, I like the original movies better than their sequels, but this is an exception.  I enjoyed the special effects of this film, especially the underground subway scene and the scene where the evil woman alien was chasing Agents J and K.  I liked Frank the pug too, who didn't play much of a role in the first movie.  If you don't care for weird humor like this, then this movie isn't for you, but to the rest of you, I do suggest you see this film.",Null,0,0,18 August 2002
Rudy," An average film
","I first saw this movie a few months ago in my CP (college-prep)writing class.  It's about a young college student who has had a lifelong dream to play for Notre Dame.  Well there's some problems that interfere with that. His size for example.  When he was a child, his brothers and sisters told him that he could never play for Notre Dame because he was too thin and didn't have enough muscle.  I really can't remember much about this movie, but I do remember (and laughed at) a scene in which one guy told another guy to 'wipe his ass!'  This reminded me of a chubby Native American girl who went to my school.  She told a skinny Caucasian (white) girl to wipe her butt.  After the movie was over, my CP writing teacher gave us each a worksheet to fill out about the movie and it included questions about us and what goals we would like to reach.  I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be a pretty darn good track athlete this year.",Null,1,5,24 February 2000
Men in Black," Great blend of science fiction and comedy
","I first saw this movie when my family and I went to our local theatre.  I thought it was pretty good, but it was very weird.  After that, I borrowed it from my grandma, who doesn't really care much for it.  What's kind of ironic is that there is a cat in that movie that looks just like one of the cats that lives at my grandma's barn.  This movie has good acting by Wil Smith (who also acted in the sitcom 'Fresh Prince of Bel Aire') and Tommy Lee Jones.",Null,0,0,30 April 2000
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," This time, he's in New York
","This is a great sequel to the first 'Home Alone' movie. This time we have Kevin being lost in New York after getting on the wrong plane.  I remember seeing this movie for the first time at a theater with my family.  Many of the characters in here are the same including the two burglars, Marv and Harry.  Others such as the poor woman who Kevin makes friends with and the hotel clerk played by Tim Curry(who also plays Rooster in the musical, 'Annie') are first introduced in the series.  This movie had tons of humor and suspense.  One part I liked was where Kevin played a gangster video in his room and some of the staff came over.  They were standing out of Kevin's hotel room and thought there really was a man in there.  The gangster says 'I'll forgive you if you bend down on your knees and say you love me!'  The staff bent down and said 'I love you!' The gangster in the movie shot at a woman and the staff thought he was really shooting at someone in the hotel room.  I haven't forgotten about Marv and Harry.  Seeing those two get into all sorts of new (and more violent) booby traps was okay, but it got to be quite painful-looking.  For example, when Marv falls through a hole and lands on the hard cement floor, he turns out to just have minor pains.  In reality of course, that would've killed him.  I think that I like this film better than the first one even though it's a bit more violent, but who cares about the violence.  It's only a movie!",Null,0,0,31 March 2000
Titanic," Good movie, but it can leave you depressed
","While I enjoy this movie historicalwise and the plot of it as well, the ending leaves me depressed.  I dislike the fact that Jack froze to death.  I understand that James Cameroon had to make most of the passengers die because that is what happened in reality.  What he didn't need to do, however, was make Jack die since he was a main character.    If I produced this movie, I would have made Cal freeze to death instead and Jack would marry Rose.  The present time would have both Jack and Rose as an elderly couple talking about what had happened.  Another thing that bothers me is how these third class passengers were treated.  The crewmen wouldn't allow them to go up to the deck until all the first and second class people were loaded onto the lifeboats.   After breaking down the door, the third class passengers fled to the deck.  Some of them, however, gave up and stayed down in the steerage.  The scene where the Irish mother is telling her children a story to put them to sleep is very sad.  I really hated Rose's mother Ruth.  She was very nasty and shallow.  The ship is sinking, many people are dying, and all she cares about is that the lifeboats are seated according to class?  What a b****!  The only reason she wanted Rose to marry Cal was because they were broke and Cal was rich. 
I still enjoy this movie, as I had mentioned earlier, but it really isn't something I want to watch everyday.  It certainly isn't something you want to watch before you go to bed.  If you do, you should watch something funny afterwards.",Null,1,2,14 January 2001
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicholson in the mental institution WARNING: SPOILER
","I saw this movie for the first time last week when my psychology teacher showed it to us.  We had been studying psychological disorders and she figured this would be a good movie to watch.  It's about a convict named Randll MacMurphy who gets out of prison by pretending to be crazy.  When he is taken to the mental hospital, he meets the other patients and the stern Nurse Ratched.  Although this movie was a drama, there were a lot of funny scenes like when we see some of the patients throwing tantrums(it reminded me of an autistic boy who I went to grade school and still go to high school with who threw tantrums all the time in grade school).  One interesting character was Chief, the Native American patient, who like MacMurphy, was faking his craziness.  He pretended that he couldn't talk or move around well.  Another funny scene was when all the staff had gone home for the night and the patients had a party.  MacMurphy's friend came and one of the mental patients, whose name was Billy, fell in love with her.  When the staff came back that morning, Nurse Ratched discovered Billy and the woman in a bed. Nurse Ratched threatened to call Billy's mother and Billy left (he had obviously killed himself when the patients came in and saw blood all over his body).  Angry, MacMurphy strangles Nurse Ratched and she has some doctors take away part of his brain.  Chief suffocates him that night so he won't have to live the rest of his life like a 'vegetable' and picks up a sink, throws it out the window, and escapes the institution.  I really thought it was wonderful how MacMurphy brought some life into all those patients and made them feel appreciated.  I didn't like Nurse Ratched at all.  She reminded me of a techer I once had.",Null,0,2,10 March 2000
The Waterboy," Goofy, but funny
","I rented this movie from my local video store one time.  I thought it was pretty funny.  Adam Sandler was just great as the mentally challenged waterboy who provides drinks for the local college football team of a small Louisiana town.  The mother (played by Kathy Bates) is just plain stubborn. She won't let her son go to college (not to mention the fact that he's a 31 year-old man) nor will she let him play football, or in her words 'foosball.'  She thinks they are both the Devil.  One thing I noticed was how attached the mother was to their mule.  She would play badminton with him and she even let him live right inside the house with them.  Another funny thing was that whenever someone badmouths the waterboy's mother, he starts to run at them and attack them.  This later put him on the football team.  I think I would give this movie a three star rating.",Null,1,1,12 December 1999
Back to the Future Part II," This time it's back to the past
","The sequel to 'Back to the Future' has Marty and Doc traveling to the year 2015 to save Marty's kids.  Seeing Biff as an old man in the future was hilarious, but he stole a sports almanac and gave it to the 1955 Biff so he could bet on sporting events and always win.  In the alternate 1985, Biff is a rich business tycoon.  What a scary world!  One character who we are introduced to (even though she is never shown, just heard) is Biff's cranky grandmother.  'Biff, where ya goin?'  It was just funny how Biff would always get upset with her.  I mean who wouldn't.  I'm sure glad I don't have any grandmas like that. This is a wonderful film for people ages 9 and up.",Null,0,1,27 December 1999
Mr. Holland's Opus," Okay of a movie, but not one of my favorites
","I enjoy this movie somewhat, but it really isn't one of my favorites.  For one thing, it gets rather long and shows different stages of the characters' lives. What they could have done instead was just show a few minutes of those segments and then forward a few years later.  There really is a good plot to it.  Richard Dreyfuss is wonderful as the high school band director. It shows how he and his wife have to struggle some with their deaf son.  If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you not watch it all at once unless you really get into it.  That's what I'll do the next time I rent this movie.",Null,1,4,20 December 2000
The Sixth Sense," Not a great movie at all
","I remember seeing this movie recently when my mom and sister rented it from Blockbuster video.  It was pretty scary, but more so was it sad.  There was a little boy in the film who could see dead people and communicate with them.  That would certainly be awful.  I'm 19 and I know I'd certainly get scared of dead people walking around, but this boy must be 8 or 9 years old. That would be terribly frightening for a child at that age.  I just can't help but feel sorry for him.  Aside from that the film was quite perplexing because I did not realize that the psychologist was dead until the end of the movie.  If I were a teacher and graded the producers of this film, I would give them a D-.",Null,0,0,19 June 2000
Back to the Future," An awesome movie
","This has been one of my favorite movies for quite awhile.  It's just plain funny.  One of the funniest characters on the movie was Marty's father George.  His goofy laugh and the tone that he uses all the time makes him hilarious.  Another interesting character was Biff Tannen, the school bully. He would always get sayings wrong such as 'Make like a tree and get outta here!'  Who could possibly forget Christopher Lloyd's performance as Dr. Emmet Brown?  This film has it all: science fiction, comedy, romance, etc. It's sure to delight a number of people.",9,0,1,25 December 1999
Jurassic Park," Okay for people who like dinosaurs
","I received this video for Christmas of 1994.  I watched it, but didn't care too much for it.  I guess I just wasn't interested in it.  That was only time I had watched it.  It's about some people who take blood from dinosaur fossils and clone them to make the dinosaurs come back to life.  When this movie was made cloning was impossible and considered science fiction. Nowadays, however, we know better.  Even though I didn't like the movie, I found one scene funny.  It was where a man was sitting on a toilet in an outhouse and a tyranasaurus rex tears it open and I think he eats the guy (I don't remember).  That sure would be scary.
