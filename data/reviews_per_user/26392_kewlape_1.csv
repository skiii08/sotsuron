Resident Evil: Afterlife," Storyless action-gore
","This is my first review, I just had to write something. First off, I really love the resident evil story. The first movie is together with fight club and alien 2 the best movies I've ever seen. RE 2 was great and the third was offering more to the table of Alice and her powers. So I had high expectations. I shall never have high expectations again. It hurts.This movie doesn't even try to have any kind of plot. There is not even a hint of there ever being 3 movies prior to this, part from some flashbacks of characters you never really cared about. The first 3 movies told a story, this one is just a low-budget random encounter action-scene patchwork. I find it hard to believe that the same guys behind the story or the directors on the previous movies had anything to do with this one, but it seems that this is the case. That being said, I have to say that I love the Alice character, Milla Jovovich does a great job lifting this movie so that it is viewable. Wentworth Miller also shines as among the few ones who actually can act without overacting and making everything feel fake and plastic. Too bad him and Milla didn't get a decent plot to work with, this is only damaging to their career.There are so many illogical plot-lines that its funny, things burning 5 years later, ammo, fuel, food, clothes, makeup never runs out or wears out. 9 foot tall monsters sneaking unseen and unheard into a bathroom and backstabs people, superfast-moving-matrix-bullet-dodging boss suddenly tries to slowly eat his pray when the pray is aiming a badass gun to his face, weird looking wire-jumping (at the beginning when she cuts of 2 soldiers heads, soldiers who naturally don't fire when they should and if they do fire they try their best to only hit the wall in regular stupid action-movie style) and uneven quality of the special effects, where they apparently ran out of money for one of the last scenes, making it suddenly look sega megadrive. The good things about this movie is: The music, just as enticing as the first movie, Milla Jovovich, without her stunts this would amount to nothing. Next movie, and there will be another one because the movie forgot to give it an end (fair enough, it also forgot the beginning and the middle) please ask yourselves what the scenes has to do with each other and whether they tie to a story of some kind and if this story has anything to do with the previous movies or at least with the development of Alice, or at the very least telling some new information of the Umbrella corporation that makes sense. Still, I give this movie 5/10 because: 1) Its still resident evil 2) Alice is still cool 3) Soundtrack and some visuals still kicks ass.",5,1,2,27 January 2011
