The Blair Witch Project," catchy title
","The title and the hype associated with this movie, had me in a movie seat in no time flat.  But, i left the theater very disappointed and feeling as though i was cheated.  Great marketing does not make for a good movie!The only thing scary about this movie, is the fact that they are toting it as a scary movie...  borderline boring and on the edge of irritating. Proof to me that the grunge genre' will never produce a movie or music style that, is worth anyones attention.",Null,1,1,20 August 1999
