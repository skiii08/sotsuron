Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I saw Borat last night. It was unbelievable.
","This movie was gut-split-tingly amazing. I saw it last night at the Toronto Film Festival and will never forget it. I won't give too much away, but the entire film centres on Borat coming to the United States to learn the culture and report back to his home country.I think this movie may have an impact on future films is that this movie unique as it is shot with real people as extras not knowing they are appearing in a movie, or that Sacha Cohen is in character. You get the feeling sometimes that people may suspect it, and perhaps a couple are even in on it, but it doesn't really matter at all.It is almost as if you are watching a documentary - and ironically, Michael Moore was at the screening, and one wonders if this film is inspired slightly by some of his documentaries.Other times it is extremely similar to 'reality' movies like Jack-Ass - but as opposed to quick disgusting gags, this film has a story-line and characters you get to know and love and cheer for, (even if at the time of the shooting of the film they were unaware they were one). All of these elements are packed into a movie that is about an outsider trying to fit in, and reminds you of the old eighties sitcom Perfect Strangers (Is it just me, or is Borat not a more fleshed out Balki who has yet to find his cousin Larry?).It begs the question of how he gets away with it, and showing the faces of people without being sued. My only guess is that he has them sign a waver before he begins shooting... but that's another topic altogether.All and all, see this movie, as I would put a lot of money on the fact that it will be the most talked about film this year, shatter many records, and make a mint. See it first and feel like the cool kid - like I do right now.",10,6,20,9 September 2006
