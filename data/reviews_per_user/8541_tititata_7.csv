Minority Report," Too much publicity
","The movie itself is quite enjoyable, though it certainly is not a masterpiece.  The plot was original, but I think the idea could have been exploited better.  I didn't like the idea of people becoming 'probes'.  But then, there wouldn't have been any movie, would there? I found the recurrent appearance of commercial banners and messages very, very annoying.  They just kept flooding the movie, for no reason at all.",7,0,0,4 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very well done
","A beautiful movie with beautiful scenary.  Based on a thrilling novel, played by talented actors.  The movie has just the right feel for this sort of story, and the special effects are there, but not too noticeable, which is exactly how special effects should be.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the movies.There are, however, a few things I did not like.  First, Galadriel.  In the movie, she is depicted only as her agressive self, while in the novel, she is also shown to be a noble, generous and gentle person.  Then, Boromir.  In the novel, he is shown to want the One ring; however, he is also depicted as a noble, courageous and brave person who usually wants to cooperate with the others.  The movie constantly reminds the viewer of his selfish intentions instead of showing the not so perfect but okay person that he is.  Overall, the characters do not have as much depth on the screen as on paper.  I still give this spectacular movie 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,4 August 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Good entertainment
","One can compare this movie to The Emperor's new groove.  It is a light and pretty humorous movie, though not quite as funny as the Emperor's new groove.  The characters are original and so are the plot and the setting.  I did not particularly like the soundtrack, but that is because I am not an Elvis fan.",8,1,1,4 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Beautiful and nicely adapted
","When I first read the Harry Potter books, I thought, 'this would make a great movie scenario.  The descriptions are very precise and the dialogue sounds like a series of film replicas'.  Well, the movie was actually made, and I must say I liked it.I found the adaptation was pretty good; the storyline was in most part respected and I thought the acting was quite good also, although the physical description of some of the actors didn't quite fit with what I had imagined when reading the book... but hey, I can't blame anyone for that! I found the settings and the backgrounds beautiful and inspiring, and these matched very well with my 'imagined world of Harry Potter'.  Some of the cute and/or funny things I liked about the book were omitted in the film; I guess they were less important than the storyline itself. Although the movie is 2 and a half hours, I didn't find it too long.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is actually a fairly good movie. It is well worth being seen, although I must say I enjoyed the book better. I give the movie 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,27 July 2002
Ice Age," The comedy saves the movie
","I enjoyed this movie.  I liked it mainly because it gave me several moments of pure laughter.  The storyline is fairly good, but I would not classify it among the best stories I have heard this year.  The computer graphics were okay as far as the characters were concerned but the animation was nor particularly good nor particularly fluid. The characters, however, are really cute and parts of the movie are hilarious.  I give it 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,27 July 2002
Shrek," Wow!
","What a movie!  A beautiful fairy tale, fairly good graphics (and I usually hate CGI), funny jokes, funny references (I especially like the references about Disney World).  Plus, the movie has an excellent soundtrack. Children and adults can love this movie.",10,0,1,27 July 2002
Signs," Booooring
",I didn't like the movie very much.  I thought the first half was extremely boring; nothing really happened other than the discovery of the 'sign' amidst the crops.  The other half was better; at least it had a little action.  I find pretty stupid that no one discovered the way to kill the aliens before the very end when there is always a certain amount of rain around the world.  Mel Gibson's character experiments flashbacks that get very annoying towards the end of the movie.,5,2,3,4 August 2002
