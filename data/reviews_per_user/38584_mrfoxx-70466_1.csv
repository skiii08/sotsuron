Hereditary," Somewhat disturbing but great suspense
","I am not sure if this movie is a typical horror movie - in a review I read it was compared to 'the shining', but it is a superb enable of tension - building psycho thriller.The story offers so many layers that you can easily watch it over again from a different point of view from the protagonists.I am still not sure, though, what role the dead mother /granny played. I think I have to watch it over again.",8,0,1,10 March 2019
