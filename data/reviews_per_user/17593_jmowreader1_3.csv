The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not bad; better than the four-hour alternative
","This is a movie based on a very popular book, so we all should know by now what's supposed to be in it. (If you don't, either google 'Hunger Games Wikia' or read the trilogy.) It's also no secret they're pulling four movies out of three books. The problem with 'Mockingjay' is there's just so much in it, there are three not-altogether-satisfying ways to deal with the problem: make a really superficial two-hour movie no one would really like, go into the level of detail needed in one film and wind up with a four-hour show that would have taken two years to finish, or split it in half.If they would have done the whole book as one two-hour movie, what would you get? Oh...maybe a few propos, Katniss killing Snow, not really much at all.I don't think the theaters would buy a four-hour Mockingjay: it would cut the number of screenings per auditorium in half. Let me see...charge the normal admission price and lose your shirt because a four-hour flick at the two-hour price means your box office is cut in half...or charge the proper price and lose your shirt because no one's gonna pay $30 to see one movie? Decisions, decisions... Also, just how many people want to spend half the day watching one film? Or wait two years for the end of a YA franchise to come out? By then the second installment in the Divergent series would have dropped and the third would be drawing near - also, The Outliers series is already in the planning stages - and we'd have forgotten all about Katniss.So they split it in half at a fairly logical point in the movie: just before all the serious violence takes place. You wind up with a nice cerebral movie that's got a little taste of action. And more importantly from the studio's point of view, you've got a respectable movie (which all of us will be binge-watching along with Part 2 as soon as that 2015 movie is out on Blu-Ray) that doesn't tax the patience of the exhibitors or the audience. I liked this film. I thought it was better than 'Catching Fire.' There's a lot of talk about how Mockingjay Part 1 is a 'setup' movie - which it is, no denial - but Catching Fire seemed more of a setup movie than this did. I caught myself thinking during CF, 'if Snow wanted rid of Katniss so badly, why not just slip some nightlock into her flour bin and make a few fake propos?'",8,12,38,23 November 2014
The Graduate," Standard-issue 1960s coming-of-age movie, and one of the worst of its breed
","99.44 percent of the reviews for this movie read like they were written for 'Appreciation of Cinema 101' class at university. Here's one that's not.The nice way to put this is, 'The Graduate overpromises and underdelivers.'The more direct way? 'This movie is God-awful. No one should watch it.'We can go on and on about existential angst, dialectic materialism and unique camera angles all day long, but none of those things can change the fact the movie focuses on one of the most annoying people ever to grace the silver screen, Benjamin Braddock. Halfway through the movie you'll scream 'get a job, you lazy bum' so loud your neighbors will hear. This guy's worse than Catcher in the Rye's Holden Caulfield, and I didn't know that was possible until I saw The Graduate. Where do we begin? Ben gets bullied at every turn. He gets bullied into sex with his dad's business partner's wife. The whole 'scuba diver' scene was one long period of bullying. Mrs. Robinson bullies him when he hooks up with her daughter, then lies about the nature of their relationship to drive them apart. He probably also gets bullied into acquiring a cigarette habit.The sex is totally unsatisfying - it's clear the movie makers were celebrating the end of the Hays Code by throwing all the nasty things you couldn't do before into their picture...but being able to put drinking, smoking and nookie into a movie doesn't necessarily mean you know HOW to do it. A trip to the foreign theater downtown for an afternoon of French flicks would have been useful.Oh, and the music! It's like..'gee guys, here's a boring part, let's jam another irrelevant Simon and Garfunkel song in here!'Take my advice, young ones: Stick to Breakfast at Tiffany's.",3,2,7,8 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," First rule of marketing: Give the customer what he wants
","And that's what The Force Awakens does...over, and over, and over again.What does the customer for a New Star Wars Adventure want?Well...first, he or she doesn't want to wait half an hour to see some real action. Soitanly! We'll throw the Patented Star Wars Plot Crawl up on the screen, let two guys lay out a major plot point, then dump a couple hundred Stormtroopers on screen and let them start blowing stuff up. Fantastic.Fans want to see new things brought into the saga, but they also want to revisit their old friends. Yup...everyone we liked from A New Hope that hadn't died somewhere along the line is in there, and the new introductions are well worth watching. Great.And then they want a few more battles. Check. They want a great story. Got one. They REALLY don't want any stupid characters like Jar Jar Binks or the Ewoks. Gotcha. This movie is completely Jar Jar and Ewok free. They want Darth Vader. Well, he's dead - how about we give you a replacement Vader who's just as evil?Hey, why don't we throw even more battles in there? People like battles. We ain't makin' Mockingjay Part 2 here, kids, if we don't kill off a couple hundred extras a minute we simply aren't doing our jobs. You want to see people sit there and talk? Rent My Dinner With Andre. You want to see Stormtroopers get blown away wholesale? The Force Awakens is for you.They want a new Death Star. Uhh...sure, we can do that, but how about we make the new one a whole lot bigger? You like? Fantastic! And hey, while we're at it we can make the new Empire environmentalists and have them destroy planets with alternative energy!They also want the new Death Star to get smeared all over the screen at the climax of the movie. Fine. We can do that. Love it!I loved this movie. Lots of fun and nothing to complain about. Go. Repeatedly.",10,6,29,19 December 2015
