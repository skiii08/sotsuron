Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George, you can't make a movie with a mouse!! (spoiler)
","This is an example of how technology can render actors impotent, mislead a director, bury the story-making process and basically result in a film that looks like a video game.I'm sure you've heard endless comparisons with the original trilogy, episodes 4, 5 and 6. You know what those films had going for them that this one doesn't have? Focus on the story.This isn't a film, it's an advertisement for Lucasfilm's digital effects prowess.Apart from the over-digitalization of anything and everything, let's look at the story. We know Anakin needs to get to the Jedi and become apprenticed. Really, all the good stuff happens NOT when he's a kid, but when he's older. They could've done Phantom Menace in a half-hour and taken Attack of the Clones for the next one and a half, and set us up for Episode 3 earlier.But no, Lucas wants to show us how clever his digital effects are. So he puts us through a pointless racing sequence, a gratuitous land battle that doesn't add anything to the grand scheme of the saga, and a space battle of no consequence.George, you can't make a movie by moving your mouse cursor excitedly over your graphics program, OK?",2,0,1,9 March 2006
Hereditary," Well crafted - but am divided on the ending
",This film is curiously what everybody who's posted reviews here say it is. It is both stunningly good and disappointing. The last 20 minutes are where it breaks down into either a masterpiece or a cheap parlor trick. Really can't tell which one it is but guess you need to watch it again a few times to be sure.Toni Colette is a legend and this film will continue to cement her legacy as one of the best actresses out there. Shapiro and Wolff arr revelations. Byrne is just Byrne (been the same character for the last 20 years) but it's a decent effort.Well worth catching,8,1,5,26 December 2018
Ice Age: The Meltdown," A Lukewarm Outing
","What they got right in the first movie, they messed up in this second one.In the first movie, the story was thin but it was a good backdrop for the characters who had a real chemistry going. The humor came out of a strange, almost-New York-ish mix, of cynicism and warmth. Characters making fun of each other but genuinely getting to look each other as the plot developed. In this installment, the story's still thin but the humor's pretty much gone. They really could have spent more time figuring out the jokes and using each of the characters better.The first one is worth collecting on DVD. This one, ain't worth it.",4,1,2,5 June 2006
The Hateful Eight," Fine work
","It's not hard to see shades of Reservoir Dogs in this one, and of course Django Unchained, but what the Hateful Eight does well is to tell a fine whodunit in a tightly confined backdrop. Same story could've been told in a totally different backdrop and it would've been easier to pull off but, hey, worth the watch.",6,1,3,26 December 2018
Over the Hedge," Excellent character driven story!
","I enjoyed it! By now, some of us are pretty jaded when it comes to CG movies. Over the Hedge ought to make you think twice.The digital rendering of facial expressions have come a long way since the early days and Over the Hedge gets it right by giving us subtlety instead of fireworks. This movie features some of the most expressive and well-'acted' characters I've seen in a while.All the actors used their voices to great effect showing again that a where all the characters are CG, the vocal acting skills are all-important. A special shout out has to go to Steve Carell whose Hammy is a wonderful gas and also to Bruce Willis who (drained of the needless machismo he usually plays his roles with) gives us a wonderfully charismatic RJ the Racoon.A superb family film. Definitely worth collecting on DVD.",9,1,1,6 June 2006
Silence," Scorsese's ode to his faith
","Far superior to his belly flop Kundun (& less sanctimonius), Silence is a confession by Scorsese that despite working in the trenches of secular hollywood, Scorsese will one day die clutching a tiny crucifix in his palm. A must watch film which will be misunderstood by liberals and misused by conservatives, this is quite possibly Scorsese at his least pretentious.How does it stack up against his other work? Whilst the Last Temptation was a shallow comic book adaptation of a great novel, this is a more mature rendering of the burden of faith. Is it as good as Goodfellas (still his best) - nope, but it is better than the over processed Casino, or the dead-because-it-should've-been-a-documentary Gangs of New York (which was clunky and sloppy).Can't say enough about the cast. Excellent work that they should all be looking back with pride on for years to come.",7,15,20,26 December 2018
Inside Man," Spike Lee tones down the rhetoric and comes away a winner
","I've always thought Spike Lee's movies were heavy-handed because he always seems as though he's trying to pack political sentiment into his narratives. Not this time. Thankfully, the story in Inside Man is a plain, simple and neatly executed heist film.Yes, there are some political overtones but when the story is rolling, it's that much easier to buy the political side of it. This is the best Spike Lee joint in a while.The jury's still out on Clive Owen - can't make out if he's a good actor or not. Jodie Foster was under-utilized. Denzel was irritatingly over-playing everything in sight (why did they give him an Oscar?). I would've picked Jamie Foxx over him for this role ANY day. Chris Plummer is a player.Nice twist at the end but won't spoil it for you. Go watch it.",6,2,3,16 April 2006
Lord of War," Wow, surprisingly good
","So first we have Nicholas Cage, who hasn't shown much judiciousness in picking scripts and overacts regularly. Then we have Niccol, who's got an essay writer's penchant for making workable film premises a real chore. Somehow, both of them dialed back their tendencies, and nailed it.Let's start with Cage. I kept expecting him to break out into some over-the-top emoting, or overplay cool (so that it was uncool), but if you are looking for evidence that the man can act, this is exhibit A. As Orlov (guess that's a nod to Nosferatu), he makes an utterly believable sophist who can compartmentalise good and evil. Everything with him is a little caricaturish, but the character he conveys has enough cracks in the facade to make it relatable.Then there's Niccol. I was surprised to see his name on it. If you've ever watched Gattaca or the Truman show, his movies have h'igh ground' content but ate often stilted and poorly delivered coming over as set pieces. This one though, has enough grit and grime, and enough dimension to lift it out of film school.Many will react to the social message of the film and I guess that was the point, but looking at it as a film, it is good.It compares with War Dogs (2016) and War Dogs is much better made but this film does a lot more.Go watch it. Remind yourself that Nic Cage can act.",8,1,1,27 December 2018
Goodfellas," Best film Scorsese's made yet and probably ever will
","I come back to watching this film every few years and each time I watch it, it gets better and better. This was Martin Scorsese at his best. You can debate all you want about his early films, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets... they don't hold up to this one. It's as if Scorsese's got everything rolling on this one - seamless editing transitions, intelligent use of soundtrack, clever camera work, sharp script, nuanced acting ... this film had everything he had to give.In many ways, it makes me kinda sad to see how the quality of so many of Scorsese's films have tanked since. Oh, the critics will love the movie he churns out every now and then but really they usually stink.(I mean, films like Kundun - big yawner, Gangs of New York - a documentary disguised as a fiction film, Age of Innocence - enervating drama of manners) Casino is probably the only exception - it's a decent film. It's frightening how a director can slide downhill so fast.So, enjoy this film if you can. Rent it. Buy it. Watch it. Re-watch it. You'll not see a better Scorsese film.",9,0,0,9 March 2006
