First Man," It's an excellent movie for all
",I'll make this short and sweet. It's a very good movie. It's not a 9 or 10 but it's worth watching. I would be critical about the 'flag thing' if I thought there was anything to it. It was fine in my opinion. Get out there and watch it.,8,1,5,13 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A complete and total mess.
","Not much I can add, so many on here have said exactly what needs to be said. A huge disappointment, to say the least. I didn't believe that Disney would completely trash the Star Wars that we all knew, but they did.",1,2,3,29 December 2017
