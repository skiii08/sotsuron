The Monuments Men," Big disappointment
","As soon as it was released in the city I live I went to watch it; I was excited considering the actors on it; I also read the plot and seemed to be really interesting; unfortunately the film is mediocre, poorly directed and all of the actors seem to be part of a big joke that only they understand. Starting from the silly music that made me feel like watching a Police Academy movie to the stupid situations taking place in the destroyed Europe at the end of the World War II...really? If this is comedy I didn't laugh a bit; this movie had all the ingredients to be good but it was a scam; not even Bill Murray saves it (and I'm a huge Bill Murray fan). Do yourselves a favor and don't pay for this.",Null,1,3,17 February 2014
