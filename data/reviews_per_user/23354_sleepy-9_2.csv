Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Computer made as seen on preview
",Poorly made movie. Using computer gimmiks as seen in previews. Not as good as original nor any follow ups. Plot is far fetched and somewhat difficult to follow. Not cracked up to hype.,4,0,1,22 May 1999
The Mummy," Adventure with gimmiks
",This film is an adventure film with all kinds of gimmicks like moving stones in pyramids and human attacking beetles. A fire on a large ship in the Nile. A mummy and his aids that have supernatural powers.Also a biplane scene in the desert. In general an interesting but not prize winning film.,Null,0,0,22 May 1999
