The Lobster," Forget Exposition
","So minimal, and never lays out its exposition clearly. Some people are pegging this as a comedy, which doesn't make much sense to me. It's absurdist, for sure. Surreal, most definitely. Comedy? That's pushing it. It's an exploration of an alternate universe, almost. Nothing is shoved in your face. The performances, the camera, and the story all float gracefully. We're given puzzle pieces and then given the respect to assemble the puzzle ourselves. And I'm sure some people will assemble it differently from me, even. Lanthimos is doing work like no one else. It's bizarre, but never boring. It's high art, but never pretentious. Can't wait to see where he takes us next.I'd go with a bat, most likely.",9,0,3,18 April 2016
