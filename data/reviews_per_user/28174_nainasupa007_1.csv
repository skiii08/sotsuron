Conquest 1453," Don't trust the high ratings
","Its not an English movie and most probably wont be watched by a high number of English viewers . Its obviously the number of Turkish viewers that have given it a 10 on 10 rating. Im sure there are NOT a lot of Turkish movies being made with such a high budget . But for international standards its not even close. Acting is amateur, directing is just plain awful. And the story and script seem to target the Christians in a very negative way . Such movies hamper peace in our day and age . What's the reason for making such a movie ? Its ridiculous - this is considered a very sensitive topic which should not be spoken as it can fuel hatred by both sides. And that too the war of crusades had taken places 1000 years back . Why bring the whole story back again, at a time when we are trying to bring peace among the west and Muslim country's",1,43,81,30 September 2012
