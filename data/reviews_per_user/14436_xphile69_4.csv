Requiem for a Dream," AMAZING!! I couldn't believe it!
","I just saw one of the most eery, haunting, and most unforgettable movies EVER!!  I couldn't believe it!  This movie will stay with you FOREVER, if you can make it all the way through....I highly Recommend it!  By the time the movie had ended I got the chills and no one in the theatre could move or talk....unreal!",9,0,0,28 October 2000
Hostel," Best horror movie to come out in decades!!!
","'Hostel' is on of those rare horror movies that has it all, and actually pulls it off! Half the movie is just a great and funny Euro road trip. I have recently been out to a hostel in Amsterdam, and could totally understand their situation. The coffee shops, the girls, the parties, everything was so realistic, which makes the ending all the more better. They could have just finished making that movie and it still would have been good. But the fact that then finish it off with some of the most disturbing, violent, and compelling horror ever put to film, makes it an all around great cinematic experience! Defiantely a cult hit! Tarantino knows horror, and Eli Roth may turn out to be our next George A. Romero...",9,3,5,26 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Han Solo, where are you?
","Remember the days when you actually cared about the human characters in Star Wars?  People like Han Solo, Princess Liea, and the badest of them all: Darth Vader.  Unfortunately, you will get none of these in this new Star Wars Episode II.  As in the Phantom Menace, we are forced to sit through an hour and a half or so of bad acting, cheesy dialogue and a ridiculously boring plot.  That is until the final battle scenes, which are visually spectacular !  So, the choice is yours, is it really worth your time to sit in a theatre and basically wait for the ending to begin?  God Bless the DVD!",6,0,0,16 May 2002
28 Days Later...," Hardcore Art-house British Horror Show!
","These were probably the most realistic zombies you've seen in movies so far! They are FAST, disgusting, and want to 'eat your brains' (just kidding). But seriously, if you want to see a great British movie in the likes of 'Lock, Stock...' or 'Trainspotting' with great music to reinforce the narrative, this is your horror show!  Some people are disappointed by the ending, but who cares.  The reason they're disappointed is a good one.  People wanted more!  They could have made this a 12 hour epic if they wanted to, and I'd watch every minute of it.  But since it's only 2 hours, you can't resolve everything and have to end it somehow.Ohh by the way, it's scary as hell!",8,0,0,28 June 2003
