Alien 3," the sequel that never should have been
","Alien was nothing short of a true sci-fi masterpiece from the great Ridley Scott.  Then James Cameron comes in and creates one of the greatest sequels of all time.  But Alien 3 is the absolute slap in the face to anyone who loves the series.  This is a cold, heartless, and hopeless film.  When I saw this film, I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters.  My only compassion went to Ripley at seeing all the hardships she had endured throughout the ordeal.  The film had absolutely no memorable or likeable characters so when someone got killed, I really didn't care.  What really bothers me about the film is it's lack of heart.  The film had absolutely no humanity to it.  I felt emotionally cut off by it from the opening credits. The death of Newt and Hicks, to me, was a huge mistake.  I really thought that something could have emerged between Hicks and Ripley.  And Ripley's relationship with Newt was such a wonderful connection that was really the driving force of Aliens.  But now with Hicks and Newt dead, Ripley seems to have lost all her humanity and soul which gives the audience nothing to root for.  All in all, this film can never and will never go up to par with the original two, and I continue to refuse to acknowledge Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection as part of the franchise.  I even hear that there is a possible Alien 5.  My only advice to Fox is that they get either Ridley Scott or James Cameron back in the director's chair.  If you really want to enjoy a good Alien film, then watch Alien and Aliens.  Don't waste your time with any others.",Null,507,563,25 March 2001
Mission: Impossible II," a quintessential action flick
","Okay, mix together a cliched plot, a cocky stylized hero, a psychotic villain, and a lot of s--t blowing up, and you got the makings of the classic action flick.  I was really blown away by John Woo's way to make an art form out of explosions.  He does it with such precision and beauty that you forget that there are people actually acting in this.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for plot and character, but this is one of those kinds of movies where it doesn't really have to apply, just shut your brain off and enjoy the ride.  Although I did like M:I-1 better for it's plot, this one I enjoyed on the fact that I saw Tom Cruise's character show a little more development, and it didn't hurt that he got the girl this time (for those that saw the first one).  So if plot is more your thing, watch M:I-1.  If you're in the mood for one hell of a wild ride, then M:I-2 is definitely your choice.",Null,1,1,26 February 2001
Back to the Future Part II," one of the greatest trilogies ever made
","I remember I was 10 when I first saw the Back to the Future trilogy.  I almost wore the tapes out.  To this day I still love these movies.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie series like this before.  You can't just watch one without seeing them all.  It's all one story.  And I think this is the only movie trilogy ever done in real time.  Plus, all the little details that add up to create conflicts within the plot are really well executed. All in all, awesome movies.  No movie fan should go without watching them.",Null,1,2,11 December 2000
