The Avengers," There can be no going back from this.
","It once seemed like Hollywood would never realize how profitable comicbook to film adaptations could be if handled properly. But, eventually, they came around. Since then, superheroes and villains have been setting the Box Office ablaze. But, there's always been one problem with these summer season mainstays.All of the characters were isolated in their own pocket universes. We could never see Spiderman kick back with the Human Torch. Superman could never run across Green Lantern. Well, here comes Marvel's the Avengers (MtA) to do away with this shortcoming. From here on out, there can be no going back.The plot to MtA sees Loki (Tom Hiddleston), partnering with a maleficent race of beings to conquer Earth. Nick Fury (Sam Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., takes issue with this and, thankfully, has a contingency plan up his sleeve called the Avenger's Initiative.Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) come together, with some wrangling by S.H.I.E.L.D., to stop Loki. But, before they can work effectively as a unit, there are a few bumps to be smoothed out.The first 90 minutes of MtA leads to several instances of one constant of superhero team-ups. That is before they can work together, the good guys have to kick each others asses for just a bit. These hero vs. hero battles are tremendously satisfying. Thankfully, the reasoning behind all of the inter-Avenger bouts is also sound. So you can sit back and enjoy the visuals without feeling as though you have to turn your brain off.When Loki escalates his plan, however, all differences are put aside as the Avenger's assemble. During this final act, every member of the team gets their moment in the spotlight. One, who happens to be green, gets several.A particular highlight for me was a bit between the Hulk and Loki that played like something from an old Warner Bros. toon. Anyone who's seen the movie knows what I'm talking about. Besides that, there's Thor calling down thunder, Captain America laying an up close smack down on the baddies, Iron Man zipping and dodging through the urban chasms of NYC and Black Widow and Hawkeye sniping hostiles and snapping necks. If you find yourself feeling anything less than 100% involved with what's happening on screen, consult a physician or check the power level of your positronic heart—something is clearly wrong with you.When the dust settles, the bad guys have been thoroughly trounced. The good guys are all on good terms as they ride into the sunset. Nick Fury is still looking like the zenith of cool, and things are set up for the, as of yet, unannounced sequel. In short, MtA did its job admirably.Every actor brought their character to life, special recognition to Ruffalo and Middleston. Ruffalo was able to take a character that's been portrayed by four different actors (Bixby, Ferrigno, Bana and Norton) and still lend it enough pathos to make it his own. Instead of being evil for evil's sake, Middleston's portrayal of Loki depicted a tragically flawed being, driven to the brink of insanity by living in the shadow of his brother.With the introductions relegated to the solo films, the script was free to move along briskly. At the same time, it was never afraid to slow down and flesh out details that, otherwise, would've left things feeling disjointed. The SFX were superlative. The Hulk not only looked better than ever, his face resembled the actor playing him. The S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier looked surprisingly plausible. The hostiles looked imposing, and their flying behemoths were terrifying. But the major contributor to this movie's success, I feel, is Director Joss Whedon. The guy was able to take the reins of four separate franchises, simultaneously, and never once lose control. I thought such a feat would be impossible for a single director to achieve. I still think so, unless the director happens to be Joss Whedon. There's no rulebook for helming a project like this. Yet, he still hit a homerun—kudos.MtA does have its snags. The first is if you had a problem with Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk or Thor in their solo films, you'll have the same problems with them here. I took issue with Captain America.I gave the First Avenger a 10/10 on this site because I had my head up my ass and didn't notice what a fanboy I was being. Well, the deficits in that film translated to this one. The good Captain doesn't feel anywhere near as skillful or formidable as he should. There's a scene where Roger's, sans shield, is pinned by machine gun fire. In the comics, the gunman would've been eating that weapon in three seconds flat. But, this isn't the comics. As the scenario played out, complete with Rogers picking up a weapon and unsuccessfully returning fire, it made him feel less like a super-soldier and more like a regular guy in blue spandex. Yes, in the final act he got a chance to shine. But it did little to balance out how poorly he'd fared in the proceedings up to that point. The second problem I had was a minor one about Rogers' new costume. The red, white and blue stripes should completely wrap around his waist. Without that, his costume looks like blue long-johns from behind.Regardless, Marvel's the Avengers is a really fun, enthralling ride that needs to be seen to be believed. After four years of careful maneuvering, Marvel was able to successfully deliver this first of a kind film that actually lives up to the hype.ALSO: If you liked MtA, be sure to check out Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. It's an outstanding animated-series that further fleshes out the world these characters call home in a way live-action simply cannot.",9,4,9,5 May 2012
The Incredible Hulk," A truly excellent film...more please!
","The summer of 2008 was the season of the superhero at the box office. There was Iron Man, Hancock, Hellboy II, Wanted, and the Dark Knight. However, as impressive as each of these films are, one stands above them. That movie is the Incredible Hulk. However, marred by a highly questionable 2003 entry, it didn't do too well at the ticket booth. Now I hear talk of there not being a sequel to this truly superior film. How very sad.The Incredible Hulk is an action packed film that, literally, delivers the comic book to the big and small screen. When Banner hulks out in Brazil, the heavily armed and highly trained operatives chasing him were put in a very dangerous predicament. He's kicking around industrial mixing tanks and hi-lo's like they're nothing, and the gunmen were taken down to the last person without the Hulk putting any thought into anything besides getting out of that factory. Later, the Army finds Banner and a proper fight ensues. In this scene we have hummer's, tons of soldiers, APC's, a gunship, and two sonic bombardment cannons. Two words sum this scene upHulk smash. We see Banner's alter tear through all of this equipment like a bull in a China shop. It was just like a comic, but with one difference. In this scene we got to see the Hulk cut loose on a pre-Abomination Emil Blonsky. When that idiot was kicked through the air, only to have his body crushed and bloodied against the trunk of a tree, I knew the ante had been upped.All of this action of course builds up to the final showdown between the Hulk and the Abomination. In the Dark Knight, Hancock, and Iron Man, the final showdowns were mildly anticlimactic. In the Incredible Hulk, this conflict was more than worthy of the time spent leading up to it. Maybe it was the Hulk turning a cop car into boxing gloves. It could have been him extinguishing a gasoline fire by clapping his hands together. There's always the chance it was the Hulk causing a localized earthquake by stomping his feet on the groundright after yelling out Hulk smash!! For whatever reason, this fight between these two inhuman behemoths is the fight. It's like the big budget, sci-fi equivalent of Martin Riggs vs. Mr. Joshua or, even better, the fight scene in the Bourne Ultimatum. It is brutal, unflinching, awesome, and not to be missed.But, it's not all smashing. There is a tightly scripted story here as well. This movie eschews the tone of the inferior 2003 production and cuts right to the heart of the matter. Bruce Banner is a scientist, on the run from the government, who has a problem. Seeing how he set up an impromptu lab in Brazil was pretty cool. Later, landing in Mexico after an episode, it was compelling to see him pick up the pieces of his life and soldier on. In a Hulk film, you're supposed to want to see the Hulk. The script for this movie, however, made me not want to see the green guy so much. This is because every time he reared his head, it held catastrophic results for Banner. The writing is so good that it actually made me care more about Bruce Banner than the Hulk. But what is writing without acting to back it up.Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Roth, and Tim Blake Nelson all delivered in their roles. Norton really sold Banner's horror over the fact that, if he goes over 200 BPM's, his world just stops and, the next day, he has to rebuild from scratch and live with the consequences of whatever he may have done. Liv Tyler made me believe Betty Ross' anguish over loving someone who was, for all practical purposes, cursed and inordinately dangerous to everyone and everything around him. Sam Elliot's General Ross was the one bright spot in the 2003 film. While William Hurt's take on the character doesn't look as badass, he really embodies the spirit of a man who is utterly obsessed with controlling a force of nature. Emil Blonksy, as portrayed by Tim Roth, is absolutely believable as an old soldier, teetering on obsolescence, who is willing to sell his soul for power. Tim Blake Nelson made the character of Samuel Stern fully his own, by imbuing him with a comical level of intellectual recklessness that flew in the face of all kinds of common sense. The real testament to the strength of this cast, though, was when Betty was helping a threadbare and twitchy Bruce around after an episode. There was no dialogue or anything to suggest what the movie was. However, if a person had been in a coma for the last ten years and didn't know this movie existed, they still would've known what they were looking at from that one image. The acting made what could've been a typical non-scene iconic.The F/X was a step up from the previous effort. The Hulk, while still the size of a house, was more in proportion. This made it so that his status as a CGI creation was not glaring. The same is to be said of the Abomination, who genuinely looked more imposing here than he did in the comics.The Incredible Hulk is, in my opinion, the breakout action film of the 2008 summer season. It didn't make the most money. It didn't receive the most acclaim. It didn't have the biggest budget. But, like its namesake suggests, it defies all of this to beincredible. I truly hope Marvel Films realizes they have a viable franchise now that the 2003 version is dead and buried under this leaner, smarter, and vastly superior reboot. Just get the DVD, and see if you can keep your mouth closed and your pulse under 200.",9,3,5,8 December 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," The colors in this movie don't run.
","Here, in the States, we've an increasingly right-wing movement in the government that borders on being fanatical. Unemployment and underemployment are reaching all time highs. Corporations are pulling it in hand over fist while the average dude is losing out. Hell, if Congress can't figure out a way to raise the debt ceiling, by 8/2/11, the country defaults. Well here's 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (CATFA), to show what the USA used to stand for before all of thisother stuff.This is more than a good comic book movie. It's more than a good WWII movie. While CATFA involves themes such as bravery, compassion, love, integrity and strength, which are in no way exclusively American, this is still one hell of a good American movie.It's the forties, and ultra anemic Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is trying to enlist in the Army. He doesn't want to rack up a tally of confirmed kills or blindly surrender himself to the will of Uncle Sam. He only wants to do what he feels is right—even if it costs his life. However, while brave and true to a fault, he's too frail to be anything other than lightweight cannon fodder. But a chance encounter ultimately leads to Rogers becoming the epitome of human, physical potential. However, due to a tragedy, he's relegated to the USO circuit and not the front. He's a hit on stage with civilians, but the grunts in the field hold him in contempt. Then he hears Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), his old buddy, has been captured behind enemy lines. This leads to Rogers finally embracing his potential and saving not just the life of Barnes, but over 400 other POW's. With this, he finally earns the right to serve, the respect of his brothers at arms and the title of Captain America. Yes, the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) and Arnim Zola (Toby Jones) are present and in full effect. But this is much more about the shield slinger than they.I was distressed when Evans was announced as Steve Rogers. Well, that was a mistake because he smashed it right out of the park. He connected with the character in a way that made everything feel fresh and heartfelt. I knew the dude would end up on ice. But seeing it play out to the reactions of both Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell) and Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) took me by surprise in its power. Then, when Cap does wake up in 2011, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him over all he'd lost. That's about 35% script and 65% Evans' portrayal. The same can thankfully be said about every actor who worked on this film.As for the script and direction, they're also hitting homers. I was doubtful about the whole USO storyline. However, it showed how Captain America is more than muscles and a costume. It was also refreshing how the script ramped up the soldier over the super. Seeing C.A. and the Howling Commandos waging guerrilla war on Hydra was dead on and sold the military aspect of the story. It also showcased what makes this character unique in a sea of brightly colored, spandex clad characters that can fly, swing and slice through steel. This well crafted screenplay is complimented by Joe Johnston's surprisingly deft direction.It seems all the goodness Johnston didn't bring to 'The Wolfman', he delivered, and then some, to this. When Cap was in action, every punch, kick and bounce of the shield was shot clearly for the audience to see. Certain scenes were shot in a way that non-verbally conveyed mood. The USO montage was effortlessly comical, yet disheartening. Contrarily, Rogers sitting in the remains of a bombed out bar visually expressed the extreme loneliness he felt over the death of his old friend. If I had to pick a highlight of Johnston's direction, however, it would be the final confrontation with Hydra.It goes from action (a motorcycle chase, Cap smacking down a handful of Hydra agents); to somber (Cap's outnumbered and taken before the Red Skull); back to action (the Howling Commandos assault, chasing the Skull down); to romantic (Cap and Carter sharing a kiss); back to action (Cap b-smacking more Hydra soldiers, an aerial dogfight, the final battle with the Red Skull); and then to morose (the sight of the tundra drawing nearer as Cap kept that plane in a nosedive). These shifts in tone never once felt jarring or forced. In the hands of 'The Wolfman's' director, this would've been a mess. In the hands of THIS Johnston, everything was smooth sailing.Yeah, they probably could've shown how a post serum Rogers went through a grueling tutelage fit to make Bruce Wayne puke. They probably could've put more emphasis on his mastery of martial arts and acrobatic fighting style. They probably could've found some way to make the costume from the comics work. They probably could've portrayed Bucky exactly like the comics. Yep, they could've done all of this and more. But, who cares when this is already an excellent movie. The only real fault I can think of is CATFA felt a little short—not that it was rushed. I just wanted to see more. First there was 'Spiderman' (2002). Then there was 'Batman Begins' (2005). This was followed by 'The Incredible Hulk' (2008). Well now there's 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011) as the fourth flawless, highly satisfying comic-book based film.Now, on an overly politically minded aside (to tie this into my intro), maybe our esteemed congressman should take time to watch this flick. However unlikely, CATFA might just clear out the cobwebs and focus them on their duty, to their constituents, as opposed to party politics—just like Steve Rogers. At the very least they'd be entertained for 125 minutes, before getting back to the merry business of screwing so many over.",10,16,35,22 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazing is more like the third word I'd use.
","Physically, Andrew Garfield makes for a much better Web Head than Tobey Maguire or Nicholas Hammond. He looks the part in a way requiring no imagination. Emma Stone is a perfect match for Gwen Stacy's likeness, even though her look has remained frozen in the late 60's to early 70's. Martin Sheen and Sally Fields did Ben and May Parker justice and stand as this films one, truly flawless asset. Due to them, the Parkers were shown in a light that not only outdid the previous films, but managed to surpass over 50 years of comic-book continuity. There was also far less of a CGI Spiderman than in previous installments, which added a certain tactile element to the main character. Lastly, Spiderman's smart mouth was in full effect with some genuine zingers. Now, so you were warned, it's all downhill from here.To me, it was painfully obvious TASM was written almost entirely by committee. And each voice it featured seemed to conflict with another voice. There are simply too many plot holes, inaccuracies, omissions, WTF moments and pacing issues for this to be otherwise. Some of the gaps were manageable. Why did the receptionist believe Parker to be Hispanic? No one noticed Parker, in civvies, swing from the top of a high rise and down to the sidewalk in broad daylight? How is it Gwen Stacy, a high school intern, seemingly had executive level clearance at Oscorp? What was with Parker's camera setup in the sewers, since he was not yet in the business of shilling photos? Now, with the small potatoes out of the way, it's time for the biggies. What happened to Mr. Ratha (Irrfan Khan)? He seemed important. But, during the second act, he disappeared without explanation. After his incident as the Lizard, Connors is walking through the sewers and smells Peter Parker's scent, right around where Spiderman clocked him. Why didn't he remember that? When Pete went to Connors' to ask about reptiles, and saw that mutated mouse, why did he let Connor's walk away? The Lizard mutates a SWAT team into lizard men. Why didn't they go on the rampage? Why weren't they even mentioned? After Parker dispersed the cure are we supposed to believe everyone infected was instantly cured? Like the Lizard, wouldn't many of those who were mutated have gone underground? Also, wouldn't the cure have also affected Spidey? He's not reptilian, but he's still a human mutate. So a 'gene cleanser' having no effect on him at all is odd. Then, there are the inaccuracies.Half the time, Spiderman was either swinging into walls or into traffic. Other times, he had no problem swinging like a pro. The Lizard got the drop on Spiderman in the sewers, but shouldn't Pete's spider sense have gone off? Also, shouldn't it have gone off when he went to Connor's after the encounter on the bridge? Anyone else notice how Spiderman couldn't really crawl up walls? He did a lot of grabbing, pulling, pushing and jumping. But it was all far more parkour than wallcrawling. Then, towards the end, Peter was dangling from Oscorp Towers as though he can't adhere to vertical surfaces and actually had to be pulled up.Parker also got his ass kicked on a regular basis, despite being strong enough to single-handedly hold a car in midair. He didn't seem capable of hurting the Lizard. Matter of fact, had it not been for the intervention of others, Parker would've been shredded. The NYPD kicked Parker's butt too, even going as far as to unmask him. Given Spidey's propensity for adhesion, the mask coming off shouldn't have happened. The only people Parker seemed able to handle were lowly street muggers. But, when they got together, he ended up running from them. Oh, and all of the mentioned events either take place after dark or underground. So expect an otherwise colorful and vibrant character to feel quite muted by shadows. Then there are the WTF moments. Parker shows up Flash Thompson by jumping 20 feet in the air to slamdunk a b-ball? Parker catches a football and throws it with enough force to bend a goalpost? Come on. For some reason, it was also decided Parker would rock a skateboard. Who the hell Tony Hawks it down a crowded school hallway anymore? Lastly is the pacing. Despite appearances, this is a plodding film. In 2002, Parker had been bitten by the spider, gotten powers, trounced the bully, suffered the death of his uncle and was in full costume at around 30 minutes. TASM stretches the same material out to over an hour, and little of it is handled smoothly. So, if your threshold for repetition is low, prepare to suffer. Contrarily, the romance between Peter and Gwen is rushed. In two days they go from being tangentially aware of each other to being madly in-love. Even for teenagers, that's too fast. Yet Parker was sharing his secrets and going to Gwen to get patched up, although she had no medical training, in little to no time. There are a lot of careless problems here that could've, that should've been fixed, but were ignored. It feels like all Sony cared about was getting this into theaters (to retain the license) between the release of the Avengers and TDKR (to maximize earnings) instead of making a coherent film. For this, The Amazing Spiderman is merely passable. It's better than Green Lantern or 2003's Hulk, but it's not the next great Spiderman film. In all honesty, it doesn't quite break even with Spiderman 3.",7,1,2,6 January 2013
Quantum of Solace," Not as groundbreaking as they claim.
","I'm a little disappointed with the direction these new James Bond films have taken. First 'Casino Royale' was billed as a reinvention of everyone's favorite government sanctioned assassin. Now 'Quantum of Solace' is being billed as the same, if for no other reason than it's standing as a direct sequel. But, the way I see it, these films aren't rethinking Bond as much as they're just making him dirtier. Many parts of this approach do have merit.Daniel Craig's commitment to the character of James Bond is commendable. The guy works out religiously, so he looks quite imposing and capable on screen. Also, he wears this kind of dead man, 1,000 yard stare throughout both films. In doing this, the actor really demonstrates that the secret to Bond's flippant and cavalier attitude is that he's been hollowed out and relatively dehumanized under the weight of his job—kudos to Craig.Judy Dench as M makes me wonder what the hell the franchise had been doing without her for over thirty years. Dame Dench is old enough to be my grandmother, but she still comes off as 125% badass all of the time. And her character doesn't have the luxury of being able to shoot people down to sell how hardcore she is. For Dench, just like with Craig, the acting is all in the eyes—fierce eyes that seem to dissect you.Also, I have to mention the inspired casting of Jeffrey Wright as Felix Lytener. He didn't have too much to do in the first film. But in this one he managed to do something which hasn't been done before. He gave Felix enough charisma and presence to actually hold several scenes all on his own. Also, Wright manages to make Felix come off as being even more burned out than Bond—pretty badass acting seeing as how we only get to see him sitting down most of the time.The stunt-work in these two films eclipses the work done in all of the previous movies put together. I'm not talking about the Parkour. I'm talking about the fights. Combat, as depicted in most Bond films (with the exceptions of 'From Russia with Love' and 'Golden Eye') has always been too neat. I never really believed I was watching two characters fighting for the right to keep breathing. 'Casino Royale' and 'Quantum of Solace' changed this. Bond takes some serious punishment, but dishes out even more. The scene I feel really showed this was in 'Solace', when he was ambushed in Haiti by another assassin. The scene was short, visceral, and relatively bloody. Yes, Bond won. But he was injured and had to wash the blood from his face and dress his arm before moving on. Having him do this without flinching or even breathing hard really put in perspective how chillingly lethal this character can be. Now is where my review takes a negative turn.Despite the stellar casting and acting; and despite the jaw-dropping fisticuffs, this feels like an old Roger Moore Bond film. You have a bad guy who wants to control a natural resource ('The Spy Who Loved Me'). Said bad guy is wheeling and dealing with corrupt locals to further his own agenda ('A View to a Kill'). There is a high speed boat chase ('Moonraker'). An overly elaborate structure, in the middle of nowhere, is destroyed in a series of explosions (every Bond film). Last, but not least, Bond has to have one girl for each arm (one to use and one to lose), because that's how he rolls—no matter how antiquated a notion of masculinity or unrealistic.In short, I didn't find 'Quantum of Solace' to really be that different from the 22 movies that preceded it. Yeah, there are a few changes. There aren't any super cars or gadgets, which could never exist in real life, for him to lean on. Bond isn't always dressed like he just stepped out of a country club. American and British intelligence aren't always on the same page. Oh, and there is now the great taste of Parkour—something I'm rapidly growing sick of. But when it's all said and done, all of this is akin to slapping a fresh coat of paint on an old car.When the next Bond film arrives, if it is to truly be unique, go for an R rating. Bond is an inordinately skilled killer who happens to be promiscuous. Yet, the violence is never too graphic. The love scenes are always too sanitized to have any impact. Seeing as how this is a terribly violent and highly sexual character, the gloves should finally come off. There should be blood when someone is either shot or stabbed. It would be realistic to have people swearing if they were gravelly injured or dying. Also, if nudity was a possibility, there probably wouldn't be as many love scenes which serve no purpose. And, if there still were, a little skin would make them infinitely more bearable.Instead of Bond stopping a megalomaniacal conspiracy, target his standing as an MI-6 assassin in a smaller scale story. Have M dispatch 007 to locate and kill an enemy of the state who has gone abroad. Stay away from the good old standbys: implausible car chases, gunfights in crowded areas, exceedingly complex set pieces, free running, exploding hideouts, and ladies who are only there to service the lead. Instead of this, throw in some geopolitical intrigue by having the British and American Intelligence communities officially be at odds (save for Lytener and Bond). Lastly, show that Bond is not the only 00 agent. If this were true, Britain would be royally f*#ked. After 23 flicks, I want a story that shows how Bond is much more of an antihero than outright good guy. Hell, after 23 flicks, I think everyone does—including the actors.",7,3,4,11 April 2009
The Dark Knight," The best Batman movie too date...until next one--hopefully,
","I saw this flick twice in the theaters and managed to snag an early copy of the DVD last Thursday. Since then, I have watched the film four times and have yet to grow sick of it. So, where do I begin with a review of the Dark Knight? There really isn't anyway I could describe how good this movie is that hasn't already been stated 10,000 times. So this is why I'm going to take a different route and vent a little over four minor snags I noticed with repeated viewings of this stellar production.I've been following Christian Bales' career since American Psycho, and I knew he would be the perfect Batman once I saw him in 2002's Equilibrium. However, there is a problemhis Batman voice. Towards the end of the film, when Batman has the Joker trussed up and ready to go, the dialogue was laughable. The Joker's voice, as provided by Heath Ledger, was different, yet cool and authentic. Batman's voice, as provided by Bale, felt strained and absurdalmost too the point of comedy. Maybe Bale should take a cue from veteran voice actor Kevin Conroy, who has voiced Batman/Bruce Wayne for sixteen years. Bruce Wayne's voice should be upbeat, perky, and conversant. However, when he is alone, talking shop with either Alfred or Lucius, or in costume, his voice should be lower, driving, and powerful. Batman doesn't scream at people, because he's the best at what he does and is fully aware of this. He simply tells folks the way it's going to be, and they have no choice in the matter but to comply or suffer.In Batman Begins, the fight scenes were hard too make out. You could see a fist there, a foot here, but I was never able to discern more than that. The Dark Knight rectified this and has much steadier and greatly appreciated camera work for the fight scenes. However, after seeing it multiple times on DVD, Batman's fighting style is all wrong. He comes off like a blunt instrument that depends too heavily on his suit and on the fact that no one is bigger or physically stronger than he is. In short, this Batman possesses none of the precision, speed, or agility his four color counterpart does. Bruce Wayne is supposed to be a peak level, multi disciplined martial artistthink Chuck Norris crossed with Frank Dux. This is a character that has no problem snap kicking one guy in the chest, while elbowing another guy in the jaw. The Keysi fighting method, while distinctive, holds the flow of combat back by limiting his range of motion. In a future film, I'd very much like to see an agile and fast on his feet Dark Knight who just cannot be touched in a fight.But, standing in the way of this is the costume he wears. More so than any other actor to portray the character thus far, Christian Bale's physique is dead on for Bruce Wayne's. Despite this, he's kept in a suit that seriously hinders his mobility. I like how this film acknowledged the shortcomings of the first costume, but the second one doesn't seem to be all too much of an improvement. Since Wayne is a billionaire, can't he afford a more streamlined disguise that has Kevlar sewn right into the material, instead of relying so heavily on armor? Yeah, he could still have the armor over his chest, his forearms, and his shins, but that should pretty much be it. Since the police are now going to be on Batman's butt 24/7, it only makes sense for him, in a future film, to adapt a lighter and more flexible suit of arms to move around in.Finally, there is the score. I remember Danny Elfman's score for both Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992). His themes for Batman, the Joker, the Penguin, and Catwoman are all so distinctive that, to this day, if I hear them on the tube, I know what movie it is without having to see or hear anything else. That being said, this score is woefully unremarkable. The only track that comes close to competing against any of Elfman's is 'Like a Dog Chasing Cars'. Warner Bros. knows this. That is why this one track is used to advertise the DVD and is also looped over the main menu. The rest of the tracks, literally, aren't worth mentioning. Never mind the fact that, two movies in, we still don't have a defining theme for the title character. This needs to be changed, especially if the studio insists on making such a big deal over the soundtrack. Hey, maybe one composer is better than two? Then again, maybe both Zimmer and Howard need to go so that another composer can be brought in who will hopefully make some real headway with this powerful medium that can either heighten or trash a scene.Besides these four issues, the Dark Knight is highly watchable. The action is compelling. The acting, all across the board, is superb. The cinematography allows you to take in far more of this interpretation of Gotham City and it's nocturnal guardian than the previous effort. The writing is tight, moving, dark, and will make you forget all about the two and a half hour run time. I say buy the DVD, turn the lights off, kick your feet up, and prepare to lose 154 minutes of your life over and over.",8,1,4,8 December 2008
Hancock," Next time, go all the way with it!
","I saw Hancock at the Pheonix Bellair in Detroit, MI on it's opening day. The movie wasn't bad. However, it wasn't exactly great either. I liked the acting. Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman all did a good job suspending my disbelief. The story,while not the greatest this summer--by any stretch of the imagination, was good enough to keep me in my seat. The action and special effect were also well done. However, there was still a problem.There was no color to the movie. If you have a character who is super-strong, can fly, and is invincible, you're already out on the ledge--regarding plausibility. That being the case, why not go all the way. Instead of everything being rendered in a kind of drab reality, why not go with bright colors to enforce the more fantastical elements of the story. Seriously, look at it. Spider-Man has red and blue--his movies were all blockbusters. Iron Man has red and gold--his flick kicked ass. Hell, even the Hulk has green and it really helps the character pop.What do we get with the titular character to this film? We get gray, black, and blue. It didn't really stick out that much. When Hancock first showed up to save those hostages, during that bank robbery, he looked more like a early morning jogger than a superhero. Seeing as how, by that point, he was operating as a superhero, would using a little extra color to sell it have really hurt? Instead of looking super, Hancock just looked, in Mike Epps words, like he was dressed in a 'tight ass Wolverine outfit'.Then there's the other problem I had. What exactly could Hancock do? I know he can fly and is strong, but exactly how strong? I know he's fast, but how fast? I know bullets and rockets bounce off his skin, but would a stiff kick to the jewels double him over? Also, when in proximity to his other half, why, in God's name, did they have such a profound effect on the weather? An explanation about this would have been nice. Then again, it's possible I missed it.Lastly, there was the overall lack of balance of the movie. The first half was entertaining. The last half, while still solid, felt like it belonged in another movie altogether. In the space of ten minutes, Charlize Theron's character is shot, in the gut, by a shotgun. Hancock is shot numerous times and bludgeoned too boot. Then we have Jason Bateman, who saves the day by hacking off a baddies hand with an axe, just before burying the blade in the guy's chest. I felt this was all rather unnecessary and kind of defeated the lighter, more enjoyable tone of the first half of the film.At the end of the day, two tickets for Hancock was money well spent. However, shortly after leaving the theater, it's colorless nature was already causing it to loose out, in my memory, against some of the other blockbusters I've already seen. If there's a sequel, slap some more color on the dude. Make him look super. Also, explore the limits of his powers, possibly with a main stay of this kind of character--an arch-villain.All in all, Hancock was a decent enough summer flick--if somewhat forgettable. If you haven't seen it yet and are on the fence, go for it. Like I said before, it's money well spent. As to the crew of this film, kudos for keeping that twist under wraps in the internet age. You must have tighter security than Fort Knox. Next time, though, if there is a next time, go all the way with your concept. It might just help you deliver a more memorable experience.",7,1,6,7 July 2008
