The Blair Witch Project," The Most Frightening (and Smartest) Movie Ever
","The Blair Witch Project is easily the most frightening film that I have ever seen. It taps into a common sense of fear in the audience: the fear of unexpected noises in the night, as well as the source of those noises, when there is no hope of rescue. There are some who say that this movie was not at all scary. These people were obviously raised by the television in such a way that they have no imagination and no tolerance for intriguing dialogue. And that really is the key to enjoying this movie: Every word that is said is a key to understanding the situation in the film, the mythology of the Blair Witch, and why the three filmmakers choose to record their situation on tape, rather than experiencing it with their own eyes.
The Blair Witch Project is an achievement for daringly creative, low-budget filmmaking. Definitely worth all of the nightmares that it will undoubtedly cause.",10,1,2,28 July 1999
Ocean's Eleven," Terrific Fun
","I read the 'lifeless disappointment' review of this film and I couldn't disagree more. Admittedly, I was surprised that a director as good as Soderbergh wanted to do a remake of a simple heist film, but this film is absolutely brimming with fun. It's a great piece of entertainment that is paced exceptionally well. The chemistry between the characters is amazing. Reviewers will love Clooney and Roberts together, but my personal favorite pairing was Clooney and Pitt. They were marvelous. And clearly, Soderbergh let his actors take the parts and run with them. Great direction and cinematography, great dialogue, and an absolute joy to watch.",Null,0,0,9 December 2001
