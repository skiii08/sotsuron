The King's Speech," A great film - must see
","A fantastic historical drama about King George VI and his Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue.The movie captures your attention right from the start and keeps it there. It is beautifully shot and played; While the events it covers are by no means funny, the film shows the lighter side at times without taking away from the seriousness of the plot.The film does a great job exploring the complex relations that form between all parties, within the King's family and outside.You walk away moved and with a lot to think about, and after all this is what you should be after with this kind of movie.",9,1,3,4 January 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," Great disaster movie - forget about the science!
","The special effects are great, and all characters are acting naturally and believably. The storyline is simplistic enough so not to distract from the special effects and action scenes. This is what's important for a disaster movie.This movie gets criticized for its 'bad science' - who cares? The 'bad science' in this film is not like a 'factual error' in others - the heroes are placed in unusual circumstances which are impossible in real life. But, given these circumstances, they do everything (believably) right and survive. Great!Compare this with films like 'Vertical Limit' where people get into very realistic unusual circumstances (being trapped in an ice cave), do *everything* wrong, and then survive. This is what makes you feel stupid.So, as long as you expect to watch a disaster movie and not a global warming primer, you're OK.",8,0,1,13 November 2009
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Very disappointing
","I had high expectations given the Palme d'Or, but was disappointed on multiple levels.First of all, the film watches like a political statement, and not a wisest or deepest one at that. Best illustrated by the court scene, which was supposed to have viewer sympathy on the poor woman's side but in practice was just a bit primitive altogether.Everything is absolute in the film: all British are bad (except for single 'good' ones), all rich are just ripping off the poor, all anti-Treaty forces are principled people, while pro-Treaty are motivated by opportunism. I'm neither Irish nor British and English is my second language, so I couldn't care less about either side, but I just know (from experience in other conflict zones) that life is usually more complex than that.On top of that, the dialogue is at times very unrealistic; whenever there is a bit of tension everybody just yells their heads off, especially the British. Sometimes the lines are downright primitive, trying to over-emphasize the political points in case someone missed them.The plot itself can be summed up in four lines, and would take much less then 2-hour movie to convey.Overall, seems like an attempt to capitalize on (exploit?) a topic that I guess is controversial for some audiences. To an outside observer this looked like a lot of anxiety and emotion (on the part of film's creators) with very little substance.",3,3,7,4 January 2012
