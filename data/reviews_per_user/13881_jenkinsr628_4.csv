One Hundred and One Dalmatians," fantastic the best Disney movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","This is the best ever version of Walt Disney's original classic ever. When it came out on video in 1999 i was only little and missed out on this grand opportunity but in 2008 it was released again on a restored special edition 2 disc DVD which i had straight away for my 12th birthday. My favourite character is cruella devil and no artist ever drew her better than the brilliant Marc Davis. The voice was provided Betty Lou gerson who did a much better job at it than Susanne blakeslee and April Winchell , i think Betty Lou gerson was so amazing that she literally made cruella steal the film!!!!! Super super super super film better than the second by far.",10,2,3,8 June 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Very good
","I think that this version of the lion the witch and the wardrobe is very well acted and very good timing. As much as i love the BBC version, it's to long and after a while it gets boring but this version is a dead on 2 hours approximately and features some really great effects and costumes.The only reason i never gave this film a 9 and not a 10 was because most of the effects and animal characters were computer animated which works really well but its still nice to see live action acting.I think that this will be bigger than all it's future sequels because this is the story people know best and it's not too long, not over acted and has some amazing special effects.Normally the White Witch has too many lines in other versions and she over acts but Tilda Swinton kept relaxed and managed to pull a really mean witch.Overall a very good version of C.S.Lewis' most popular book.",9,1,1,11 August 2009
The Little Mermaid," best under the sea movie made
","I loved this movie because the songs were catchy and fun, the animation was cute and funny, the voice talents were a good choice and the characters were very good as well. I had this movie on video for a long period then i heard that it was coming on DVD for us UK people so i gave my video to the charity shop and had the DVD for Christmas and it gave me hours and hours of enjoyment with it's games, deleted scenes, backstage footage, music video and the movie itself! Originally Disney wanted Joan Collins to voice Ursula but i'm glad they chose pat Carroll instead because she was a perfect for the role and what everyone must remember is that Ursula is not half an octopus but is half squid because it's less expensive to draw! Overall a wonderful Disney masterpiece that's way better than it's sequels. Gotta give it 10!",10,2,2,30 August 2009
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Good
","This version of Snow White and the seven dwarfs in my opinion is the best. Positive points i like about this movie are firstly the fact that there has been lots of animated versions of the fairytale made and none of them have out stood Disney's animation. Secondly i enjoy the charming songs in the movie because they are magical. Thirdly i like the voice talents for examples Pinto Colvig voiced Grumpy and Sleepy and they sounded so different. Also Lucille La Verne also voiced two characters - The Queen and The Witch.Many animated versions have been produced of this charming fairytale and this one out stood them all with it's animation, songs, characters and that Disney touch! This animated version was the original and simply is the fairest of them all!! JCJ",8,3,3,24 July 2009
