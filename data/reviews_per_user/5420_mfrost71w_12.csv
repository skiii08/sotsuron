3:10 to Yuma," Did anoyone involved actually watch the original?
",I can only assume that nobody involved in this movie actually watched the original before deciding to remake it. This garbage bears no resemblance to the original at all. The original is a tour de force in tension and fear as they sit in the hotel room awaiting the train - this makes up most of the 1957 movie; in the remake it forms less than a quarter of the movie and all the tension and dread has been removed. The hero redeems himself by sticking to his principles and wins through; in the remake the hero sticks to his principles and gets killed. As a stand-alone movie its a pretty poor formulaic western with all the usual cliches. An uninspiring story played by uninspired actors - I thought Peter Fonda was the best actor playing the best character but he's only in it 15 minutes. As for adding a kid character who simultaneously gets in the way and saves the day...I can only assume the makers of this turkey also haven't watched several hundred b-movie westerns that use the same plot and have done it to death,2,0,3,27 June 2018
Gravity," Science? We don't need no stinking science
","Is it just me? Did I miss something? After all the hype and Oscar wins I finally got around to seeing Gravity three years late and what a disappointment it was. It is beautiful to look at with super special effects but other than that it is a very poor film. The dialogue is poorly written and poorly delivered, Bullock's acting is wooden, the plot is preposterous and, worst of all, the science is non-existent. As far as the film-maker's are concerned Newton was never born; they certainly refuse to accept his 3rd Law of Motion. They almost never get the motion right for space and indeed one major plot point relies on the commander of the mission apparently having no knowledge of physics....when he's at the end of the tether and tells Bullock she has to let him go to survive, he is stationary - there will be no forces acting on him at all, so his tether wouldn't be under tension like he's hanging off a roof; if he just jerks gently on the tether with his arms it will impart enough force to put him in motion back towards Bullock and the space station - he certainly wouldn't start moving away from the tether just by letting go. As for Bullock being able to undock, fly, separate and re-enter both Russian and Chinese craft after 6 months astronaut training as an electronics equipment mission specialist, well.....words are beyond me - she wouldn't have been trained to fly the Shuttle let alone foreign craft. Space debris flying fast enough to orbit the earth in 90 minutes would be lethal down to a millimeter in size - the smallest speck would hole a spacesuit yet all the astronauts are in the middle of clouds of such debris that decimate the Hubble, the shuttle and a space station. The Chinese space station could never be in a stable orbit that would decay enough after 90 minutes or so to burning up on reentry. I can see it would be an exciting and tense film for children and the dim-witted but I'm afraid sentient adults will be gnashing their teeth throughout the film.",3,0,1,28 July 2017
The Hunger Games," Did I miss something? Or was it a really bad film?
","I seem to be in a tiny minority who found not a single redeeming thing in the film. Perhaps I'm too old, seeing as the film was obviously aimed at little kids, although I didn't get this from the publicity.I haven't read the books but the story on film is a poor re-hash of 'Battle Royale' with elements from 'Lord of the Flies' and a huge steal from Stephen King's (Bachman's) 'The Long Walk', with a bit of the flavour of the movie version of King's 'Running Man' as well - derivative hogwash. I think I could even see themes lifted direct from 'Rollerball'. Certainly 'The Long Walk' explores exactly the same themes as Hunger Games but achieves them far better. Probably wouldn't have been an exciting film though, seeing as the youths merely have to walk at a set speed until only one is left. The acting and direction were poor. The special effects were feeble. The storyline was predictable and obvious. Character development was so poor you cared nothing for the life or death of any of the characters, including the heroine and the little girl. The love story was emotionless and unbelievable. The fight scenes were flat and unexciting. The bad guys and the 'grown-ups' were cartoonish and one-dimensional. Poverty and desperation in the 'village' was conveyed by giving everybody 1940's clothes and haircuts, for some reason I haven't worked out yet - except for the heroine who, although poor and starving, seemed to put on a very expensive designer Italian leather jacket to go out hunting. All very bizarre.It has obviously given rise to 'The 100', which has a similar feel of a derivative teen-angst story taken from far better 'dystopian future' novels and is another failed project of poor quality in writing and acting",2,6,10,31 July 2014
Alexander," When did Mel Brooks change his name to Oliver Stone?
","Wow...somehow Alexander passed me by when it came out and I've just seen it for the first time, in 2009. I couldn't remember hearing anything about the film, good or bad, except I seemed to remember it was generally thought Farrel was mis-cast. I am truly astounded that the film is not infamous for being the worst film ever made, for surely it is. From the very first second to the last it is truly appalling - the acting, the dialogue, the directing, the cinematography.... everything. Is it a deliberate parody? is it comedy irony? I swear, if Mel Brooks was going to make a 'Young Frankenstein' version of Alexander, this is exactly what he would have made. He wouldn't change a line. I had the same feeling with this film as I get when watching the early work of Leslie Nielsen - his work on Airplane! and Police Squad (I suppose I have to mention the inferior Naked Gun movies too) means his deadpan delivery is immediately funny; unfortunately I forget he used to be a straight actor and when you see him in 60s and 70s shows like Columbo or Kojak, he uses exactly the same deadpan delivery and you can't help but laugh at all his lines and actions, even though it's supposedly serious drama. This 'is this serious or is it supposed to be funny' feeling runs right through Alexander. I actually did laugh out loud at nearly all the scenes with 'snakes are just like people' Jolie and 'ah-ha jim lad' Kilmer, and Farrel showed his comic genius when he pulled his Ben Turpin wide-eyed manic stare when deciding whether to chase Darius or go back and save his baggage train. As historical epics go, it's as funny as Life of Brian. I was unsure whether to give the film a 1 as the worst film or a 10 as one of the funniest parodies I've seen in a while. Which ever it actually is, it's worth watching in slack-jawed awe.",1,4,5,27 September 2009
No Country for Old Men," Interesting but disappearing up its own arse
","Well, the Coens always make 'interesting' films and I'd have to say this is no exception. They make very good vignettes I think, and some scenes in this film make nice little stand-alone pieces of cinema but, overall, they don't give a damn about the film as a whole. It has been put together clumsily and without feeling. The characters are essentially 2D, the plot has big holes in it and many plot lines, big and small, just peter out or are not resolved. Stupid things like the hero deliberately leaving his car half-a-mile away from the death scene in a pitch-black desert and walking the rest of the way merely so the next scene with the bad guys can take place. The killer seen waiting in the motel room for the sheriff to create tension but then, oh, he isn't because it was, what? a flashback? the sheriff's imagination? a cinematic artifice? The philosophizing of the characters, especially the sheriff, is supposed to be deep and meaningful I guess but is more like Monty Python dialogue. Following the hero intensely and then having his final scene off-camera may be 'clever' film-making but it is deeply unsatisfying. It is very contrived, especially they way they flag-wave it as an 'intellectual' film but not answering any questions the viewer may have such as what happened to the money, what happened to the wife, what happened to the bad guy, etc.. Scene-after-scene, from beginning to end, was deliberately left without a conclusion; it became tiring after a while and you begin to think 'why am I watching this scene? I know there isn't going to be an ending or any kind of resolution or denouement'. Not a good film for popcorn-eaters but an interesting artifice for auteur geeks perhaps",3,4,10,7 January 2011
Zulu," A paragon of simple film-making
","A simple story well told. No scene-setting, no moralising, no character development, no histrionics, no politics, no polemics. If Hollywood had made it Chard would have to have fallen in love with the missionary's daughter and a Zulu would have to have been fighting with the British, agonising over his torn loyalty to his people. The films strength is that it is just a simple war story told well without any frills or wasted scenes.As for historical accuracy, as 'true story' films go, you will not find one as accurate as this I can assure you. Every true story film I've seen has made drastic changes to the story to fit in with the drama or omitted large parts of the story as 'confusing'. For the cinematic world Zulu is virtually a documentary.",9,14,16,1 March 2002
The Hurricane," Dangerous and a lesson to us all
","There is no doubt that this is a moving and inspirational film but therein lies its danger. I still think that it's moving and inspirational after watching the film DESPITE knowing from the start that almost everything in it is a provable lie and that Carter was almost certainly guilty. Anybody undertaking even the most cursory of research will inevitably realize that Carter is a congenital liar and fantasist and twists the truth even in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence; no - his first victim wasn't a paedophile but was hit over the head with a bottle so his watch could be stolen by Carter, no - he wasn't a very good boxer and was a has-been at the time of his arrest, no - he fairly lost his one title fight and his opponent successfully sued the film for the suggestion that it was a racist decision, yes - he was a criminal with multiple convictions for robbery and violence, no - he was a terrible soldier with four court martials and no medals, no- he was not involved in the civil rights movement in any way, yes - there were black jurors (2) at his trial, no - he failed a lie detector test and refused to take another one, no - he was pulled over by the police within 10 minutes of the 911 call because his car matched exactly the description given by witnesses but was let go because he was the well-known boxer It is a sobering example of just how frighteningly powerful propaganda can be and how easy it was for Hitler and Stalin to lodge their ideas in the minds of the masses.",4,4,8,30 December 2007
Titanic," A very, very bad movie
","Obviously made merely because special effects had advanced to a level to do justice to the sinking of a huge ship. Alas no thought about plot, dialogue, cinematography, historical accuracy, and so on. A plodding, cliched, made-for-TV, double-cheese-to-go fast food film with some good special effects but deserving of no Oscars, as time will tell.",Null,1,5,24 June 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," Nothing more to be said
","There's no point in commenting on this film; it's simply the best thing to come out of Hollywood. For me it's a barometer - Everybody I like seems to love Wonderful Life while the few people I dont get on with dislike it.As for Jimmy Stewart, is it a coincidence he plays the two nicest men in the world, George Bailey and Elwood P. Dowd?",10,1,4,1 March 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Bad Acting, Bad Directing, Bad Script, Bad Production...Bad
","What a wasted opportunity...this could, or rather should, have been a great and innovative war film. The material was there, the sets were there, the atmosphere was there. Unfortunately appalling dialogue, poor production and terrible acting completely ruin the film.Given the corny dialogue (particularly in the romance scenes), the very poor studio over-dubbing and stilted acting (Ed Harris perhaps excepted)I can only assume that the Director has made nothing except porn films in the 1970's. The sub-plot consisted of all the worst bits of the love story in Titanic, itself perhaps the worst film ever made; cliché after cliché, improbability after improbability. I mean...people deliberately getting themselves shot dead as a 'favour' to the hero...pleeeeeze Avoid like the plague",2,2,4,30 August 2005
Heat," LA Takedown a better movie?
","Heat is an excellent film but I was always disappointed with the end; I thought the DeNiro character wouldn't just blindly run from Pacino - he would have waited for him and shot him down, surely? I must have counted a dozen occassions where DeNiro could have safely ambushed Pacino. The earlier film LA Takedown, which is almost scene-for-scene and line-for-line the same as Heat, has a better ending I think, more true to the De Niro character anyway. Why Mann changed it for the implausible ending of Heat I can't conceive.Having just watched the two films within a day of each other, it is amazing how close they are; even down to the cut-aways, close-ups and zooms. The scene in the diner and then outside when Waingrow is about to get shot but disappears is identical in every way, as is the scene when Patrick/Neil meets the girl when reading a book (except in Takedown she designs album covers and in Heat it's CD covers!).The bank heist shoot-out in Heat is one of the best scenes in cinema history. Wonderfully put together and filmed, the violence is shocking rather than merely exciting. It makes you feel that you've been a witness to a real life shoot-out; a very different and disturbing feeling to what most cinema violence gives you these days.I would have given it 10 out of 10 but for that ending. Somehow the last 10 minutes make you feel that you've wasted the previous 2 hours and 40 minutes. Gotta go down to 7/10.",7,0,1,1 March 2002
Braveheart," Hollywood at its worst
","As a film it is obviously intended for children and retards; looks good but the dialogue and plot are puerile, the directing and acting, especially of Gibson, are over-the-top. Then we come to the story......'I know' someone said, 'lets take a factual story and rewrite it so that not one single fact remains'. Why?? I've never understood the Scottish fascination with Wallace - he was a useless commander who won one battle in his life by ignoring the code of chivalry and attacking while the English crossed Stirling Bridge and then spent the rest of his life hiding from the English and leading his band of cut-throats over the border to destroy undefended farms and villages. His next biggest victory after Stirling Bridge was against an English Nunnery where he raped all the nuns and killed all their goats and sheep. Not in the film? I wonder why. Eventually even his Scottish supporters got so peed off with him they deliberately shopped him to the English.And if I was more than 1/4 Scottish I'd be a bit miffed that the Scots were painted with blue woad, more than a thousand years after the demise of the Picts who may have worn woad but were a different race to the Scots",2,4,11,6 July 2007
