Hereditary," I've watched this over and over
","This movie is one if the most terrifying horror movies I've seen in a while. The movie starts with an odd family that seems to have a secret and eventually turns into the horrifying demon possessed family trying to continue on they're work. I don't want to say much but if you haven't, take the time to watch it at least once.",8,1,4,9 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I had fun watching this
",This movie was really good I like the cinematography of the film and I like the cast that was chosen. For me the ultimate point of the movie was about A declining actor who is trying to save his career but I felt like through out the entire movie I was waiting for more to happened and when it ended I felt like there was a good size chunk of info I was missing. When the manson family was Introduced in the film it kept it interesting. I would watch it if you haven't yet it's worth checking out as I am a huge fan of all of his movies and if you are too you'll enjoy this one.,7,0,2,16 September 2019
It Chapter Two," IT was amazing!
",I loved the second movie the most. It's got a lot of different things from the book and the original movie I don't want to give anything away but I loved the cast and I feel like there's a few easter eggs in this one. This movie honestly gave me the creeps by the way they had penny wise and all his other forms act through out the film. Highly recommend seeing this!,9,6,10,9 September 2019
