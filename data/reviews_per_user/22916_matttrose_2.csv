Child 44," Do a great film justice & pay to watch it!
","Excellent, excellent film. How 'Furious 7' received such great reviews and this film did not is beyond me. Definitely pay to watch it. Do a great film justice and don't let it die with Furious pissing on its grave.44 Child makes you actually feel as if you were transported back to soviet Russia and gives you the feeling of helpless in an unjust government. It was banned from Russia for a reason. Tom Hardy gives an excellent performance and you find yourself feeling sympathy yet cheering for the success of this man who appears emotionless towards acts of monstrous brutalities and a moral compass.",10,226,361,22 April 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Terrible Movie
","This movie starts with no explanations and ends with none. It took the fun weirdness of the original Mad Max and made you wish you had seriously saved your money. The director tried way to hard to push a weird image that he forgot to even think of a plot. I am a big fan of the original Mad Max films so I understand the dialog that belongs to it and this was not it. Completely lazy writing with a combination of a just dumb story plot, made for an overall awful experience. The only redeeming quality of this film was Tom Hardy's Max mannerisms which of course he did well but they should have never even been able to call it Mad Max in the first place since he wasn't even the main character. I could have went to Pitch Perfect if I wanted to feel guilty for being a man. PLEASE BE ADVISED: save your money and your time!!!",1,33,72,17 May 2015
