The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Wow
","What we've all been waiting for...I don't think anybody was expecting that, even the readers who knew about the blood and gore which was in the book. This movie is a definable paranormal romance, as some would say, and if you ask me, I believe there was no other way as to take what was in the book and portray it in a movie. I believe Condon did a good job (in terms of portraying the elements in the book), but I also know he's going to get so much sh*t, and kind of feel sorry for the bloke. I do wish it was more like the third movie, in my opinion that was probably one of the best movies I've seen; It had love and romance, but not too much of it. It showed all the elements in such an amazing way, using different technological film effects and the themes were just astonishing.Obviously, we all know that this was not the best of the series, but just like Harry Potter, the second half will definitely make up for it. The bad thing though, we're going to have to wait another year.",Null,2,9,19 November 2011
