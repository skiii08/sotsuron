Saturday Night Fever," Decaf Scorcese with unlikeable characters. Good dancing though.
","Okay, I was into punk not disco back in 1977, and held off seeing this movie on ideological grounds for many years. Perhaps if I'd seen it during its heyday it would have carried more weight, but when disengaged from the giddy heights of the disco era it does not travel well. This is basically 'Scorcese lite'; a sort of 'Mean Streets' done for teens, and missing out almost everything which made Scorcese's work so compelling. The viewer is faced with a parade of characters so stupid, self-centred and under-developed that it is virtually impossible to bond with any of them. Tony Manero is an idiot and his friends are even more moronic, whilst the girls are doormats (nice-but-dim Annette) or emotionally distant egotists (brash big-talking Stephanie). Add to this some downright unfathomable casting; Martin Shakar looks more like Tony's uncle than his brother (seriously, he looks a good ten years older) and whilst cast as Tony's crucial dance partner, Karen Lynn Gorney's ability is conspicuously 'school lunchtime disco'. Check the bit at the dance studio where she and Tony converse whilst she's practicing; it looks like she's been learning to dance for all of twenty minutes. Having said that, the dance scenes themselves are the high point of the movie, even if they are all Tony's show. In fact, there is an uncomfortable strand of narcissism and outright homo-eroticism to 'SNF' which is all in keeping with the essentially non-macho disco scene. With its falsetto vocals, elaborate studio-bound arrangements and invariably sex-obsessed lyrics, the music was made by producers, not neighbourhood bands, and the emphasis was on glitter and flash, not grit and trash. The dance scene's flamboyant, exhibitionist nature was far more in-tune with 'gay' sensibilities than the world of rock music, and so it was that disco suffered a boom-and-bust popularity over the late 1970s. 'Straight' society briefly sampled what the movement had to offer and then moved on to more gender-friendly cultural climes. By 1979 it was all over, and 'new wave' music was all the rage. Considerations of personal taste aside, 'SNF' is less than the sum of its parts, clumsily realised with characters who come far too close to being repellent without any redemptive qualities. It is all too apparently a vehicle for John Travolta, who served notice with his performance that his entire career would be based on slight variations on his 'Vinnie Barbarino' character from 'Welcome Back Kotter'. He struts solipsistically through 'SNF' wearing the exact same expression you see staring blankly back at you from a fish-shop window. Away from the dance floor, he could not carry the movie, which is a massive weak point since none of the other characters are as extensively written. By all means watch 'SNF' for nostalgia, for the dancing or the music or the actors, but not as a movie experience, because you will be disappointed.",2,20,41,19 February 2012
Orphan," If you're a horror fan you'll like Esther...
","If one watches enough horror movies, one gets to know the territory pretty well. I've done so for a few decades now and sure enough, the plot of 'Orphan' is a familiar one. I twigged the twist around halfway through as well. Nevertheless, despite many similarities to the usual cliché-bound dime-a-dozen penny-dreadfuls one sees so much of in the course of exploring the horror genre, this movie actually has something. The acting is good-to-excellent and the script and direction suspenseful above the average, but there's an extra element of uncertainty which makes it genuinely creepy. There were plot holes all right and the rather unimaginative ending didn't quite fit but 'Orphan' was a fun ride all the same. A pleasant surprise.",7,1,2,9 December 2010
Knowing," You may prefer NOT Knowing..
","All right, I didn't expect much. Nicholas Cage, lots of special effects, big ballyhoo... Intriguing premise, though. Actually, to be fair it started off okay (even if the Spooky Little Girl character has long become a bit of a cliché), not that bad at all. Sadly, about a quarter of the way through the movie blew a tyre and it was a rough, uncomfortable ride on down to the really, really bad ending. Think of a snowball rolling down a hill, only it's picking up garbage, not snow. Normally I'd just chalk a bad movie up to experience, but this one made me mad. The dialogue was banal, the special effects were anything but, and to put it nicely the storyline didn't bear close scrutiny. In fact it was mildly infuriating nonsense. By the time those angels-sorry-aliens Close-Encountered the kids and took them away to the Marvellous CGI Planet, I'd wanted my money back for well over an hour (BTW, just because something is two hours long, it doesn't make it an 'epic'. Just long). Nonsense. Bland, silly nonsense.",2,1,3,29 October 2009
The Love Guru," Thoroughly dispiriting 'comeback'; knocked out in the first round.
","They played this one on TV, and I happened to be in the room, pottering about on a Sunday evening. That is the only reason I decided to watch this, because it's been out for two years and one has to have been in an isolation tank not to have heard what a turkey 'The Love Guru' is. It almost made those rubbish Troma movies appear amusing, or at least on a par. On a par, in this case, with the belated 'comeback' effort of a formerly successful and well-liked comedy writer-director-actor whose career had bloomed in the 1990s and floundered in the 2000s. After revisiting his most successful creation (1960s spy-spoof 'Austin Powers') with a third trip to the well in 2002, Myers' live-action movie career stumbled with definitive misfire 'The Cat In The Hat' in 2003. For the next five years Myers remained off-screen, voicing the title character of the animated 'Shrek' movie franchise, until...'The Love Guru'. The movie's many faults are detailed by other posters, but what struck me was how truly sad an experience it was. A genuinely heart-sinking experience akin to watching an old dog trying to jump the fence one time too many. Myers' sense of comedy has gone seriously -and perhaps permanently- adrift, and he has effectively taken a mildly diverting two-minute TV show sketch and stretched it to micron-thinness over a motion picture frame. Look, shall we just do both Mike Myers and ourselves a favour and remember him as he was; i.e. cute and funny? This sad, sobering movie is like a chapter from 'Hollywood Babylon'.",1,11,21,12 December 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Enough 'Apes' movies already; stop the madness!
","Of a total now of seven the 'Apes' movie franchise spawned but two truly enjoyable entries; the iconic 1968 original and its first sequel 'Beneath' (1970), which was basically a hot-rod rerun with added radioactive mutants. After that the budgets were cut and quality dwindled. 'Escape' (1971) was essentially a modern-day thriller about fugitives who happened to be apes from the future, and only nominally science fiction. 'Conquest' (1972) was similarly a rather conventional 'revolution' movie with apes in the role of the oppressed. The cheap, cheesy and simple-minded 'Battle' (1973) brought the run of 'Apes' movies to a rather tatty and careworn end, but there was the ignominy of a conspicuously low-rent 1974 TV series to follow. Tim Burton's bizarre and confusing 2001 remake of the original 1968 movie succeeded only in debasing the series further, and now we have 'Rise'. Sadly, 'Rise' is an over-filled compendium of timeworn clichés about the slave who frees his people and successfully leads his people to freedom (head ape Caesar does rather overdo the grim, determined 'rebel hero looking defiant' poses). Or at least that was where the slightly puzzling ending seemed to be going. Plot holes are a persistent hazard, and there is one particularly galling example when the research center apes, having been exposed to the brain-enhancing virus and rather unfeasibly mutating into brainy apes literally overnight, storm a city zoo and liberate the apes there, who immediately join the Cause. Never mind that the zoo apes haven't yet been exposed to the embraining virus. 'Rise' has a banal script and a narrative which actually seems blissfully ignorant about its hack writing (all characters are uniformly thinly-sketched 'goodies' or 'baddies') and glaring lack of originality, but the unconvincing CGI special effects were also a problem. It is 2011 and we surely should not be put in mind of those weird-looking things which were supposed to be taken as chimpanzees in 'Jumanji' (1995). In closing, I rented this movie with a promotional 'free hire' voucher, and it still felt like I was sold a bag of bad oysters. No more 'Apes' movies, please. Let this dull, clichéd and dumbed-down effort be the last of its kind and let that be an end to it.",2,2,11,18 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Don't get excited, it's just classic noir elements with a lick of paint.
","After finally catching up with this one, after all the hype and bluster it was something of a letdown. Not a disaster, nor even a complete failure, but it didn't live up to the claims of excellence. 'TGWTDT', for all its computer-hacking punky female lead and squirm-worthy scenes of sado-masochism, is a firm-handed throwback to the film noir 1940s. You've seen this sort of story before; detective gets hired for an unusual case, hooks up with a spunky can-do girl assistant and both put their lives in danger when they discover more than they bargained for. The movie goes on for around thirty minutes too long, there are a couple of painfully glaring plot holes (we're asked to believe that an expert computer hacker can't arrange an alternative bank account for herself, for example) and the evil social-worker sub-plot was pretty much as unnecessary as it was unpleasant. Most crucially, it was just a little too hard to empathise with Lisbeth, which would have helped immensely, but as a character she remained too 'distant'. Whilst the acting was merely okay, it was the unfolding of the movie's old-fashioned hard-boiled thriller plot which commanded the attention, and the direction was well up to par although there could have been more 'tautness' to the whole. A mixed bag, but one to be enjoyed (bar the 'social worker' subplot) as basically a homage (intentionally or not) to classic film noir.",6,1,2,26 December 2011
Paranormal Activity," Twenty-minute story; eighty-minute movie.
","Remember those old 'portmanteau' movies, where you got a mixed bag of three or four stories? Imagine someone extracted a fair-to-middling twenty-five minute segment from one of those, padded it out with filler scenes and bloated it up into eighty minutes. Alternately, 'Paranormal Activity' resembles the product of the sixth best short story in an anthology made into a full-length movie. It's just too puny a story to carry the weight, and the movie is far too slight as a result. 'Paranormal Activity' comes across very much as a 'Blair Witch' wanna-be, although it misses entirely that movie's engaging mythos and 'ghost story' quality. The ending of 'PA' was actually pretty bad (I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was), but rest assured that the alternate ending (included in the 'Extras') is way worse. This movie would have only gotten one star were it not for the bits where the girl gets out of bed and stands still for hours. Those were about the only bits which really worked. Oh, and the girl was very cute, too.",2,0,2,4 May 2010
Super 8," Ideal entertainment for the timid and unadventurous!
","If you've ever wanted to see a cinematic mash-up of the Goonies and Cloverfield, then look no further. That's about the best you can say about 'Super 8', and it's not a compliment. Honestly, I regret even paying half-price rental for this candy-assed load of sticky-sweet bubblegum nonsense. 'Super 8' was total cornball pap from start to finish, and an ideal flick for the kids' slumber party. Rest assured that youngsters won't be getting too many bad dreams after this one. Oh look, I've said all I need to, but since I have to spin this review out to a minimum of ten lines of writing, let me just say in closing that okay there we go that's ten lines, see ya later.",1,2,4,21 November 2011
Downfall," Hitler was human. And that's the point.
","After watching this movie, I was intrigued as to why anyone might have 'hated it', and after reading the relevant IMDb reviews, I think I know. There were actually many reasons given; objections to everything from acting to sets to direction and more, but in light of the movie's evident quality they seemed to be nit-picking at best. The acting is first-rate, as is the rest of 'Downfall'. This is a powerful, gripping movie with characterisations so well-realised (Hitler himself, secretary Traudl, the supremely creepy Josef and Magda Goebbels and many others) they will haunt you. What the 'hated it' reviewers actually didn't like was the humanistic portrayal of Hitler. The hunched, shuffling and twitching 'grandfatherly' Hitler of 'Downfall' is a far cry from the long-familiar vigorous, raving 'madman' incarnations of popular culture. How anyone could have got a 'sympathetic' treatment of Hitler out of this movie is unfathomable. Yes, this Hitler is an ailing, crotchety, prematurely aged and even a vulnerable man; sweet to Eva Braun and his pretty young secretaries, but also the architect of the global madness which has backfired so catastrophically and is even now smashing its way towards him and everyone else hiding in his bunker. It is a tragedy of Shakespearian proportions, and entirely Hitler's doing. All of the executions, infanticide, suicide, revenge atrocities and madness of those last days of the Battle of Berlin are the end product of decades of his work. One of the most vehement 'hated it' criticisms was that the past crimes of the Third Reich (principally the Final Solution) were not detailed in the screenplay, but there is little need to gratuitously invoke the Holocaust with this tsunami of death, destruction and insanity bearing down on Hitler, his associates and his beloved Germany. To leave it as a barely-mentioned background feature makes its creator seem even more reprehensible, not less; because it is as if he didn't care about anything but his place in history. In the end, he is crushed and even tearful that it all ended this way, but he cries for himself, not the millions he has caused to die. Hitler has a human face, and is all the more terrifying for it.",10,1,2,21 November 2011
Jaws," Great movie, except for the shark...
","Saw this again on TV last night and it still works; it's one of the great monster movies alright, but the only thing wrong with it is the monster. Oh, the vast majority of 'Jaws' is spot-on; Spielberg has correctly concentrated on the characters and not the situation. The mayor's grotesquely 'loud' jackets are just a little too obvious a labeling device but otherwise the town and its characters ring true, and we are swept along with these ordinary local folk as the plot develops. Robert Shaw's Quint has a few rather hammy scenery-chewing moments, and the actor does occasionally appear to have had himself a wee private party before filming some scenes. Still, he is supposed to be a local weirdo, and so his 'crusty old sea-dog' shtick isn't too much of a distraction. The changing relationships between the three men on the 'Orca' is another welcome subtlety often missing from horror movies. After establishing a supremely sinister presence throughout the movie, we must inevitably see the shark, and the more we do, the less we want to. The much-trumpeted animatronic creature doesn't really look alive, and even back in 1975 when audiences had no access to movies outside of a theatre, the moment when the 'shark' rears up out of the water and flops against the stern of the Orca looked absurdly like the attack of a colossal salami sausage. It's not a perfect movie, but 'Jaws' is most of the way there, and aspiring horror writers could do way worse than take a leaf or three from its meticulous care with the characters. After all, they are our stand-ins, and if we don't identify with them then horror turns to farce or worse still, tedium.",9,3,6,4 January 2013
The Conjuring," All conjuring tricks, but no real magic.
","As a kid I used to like staying up late to watch those old early-70s TV horror movies like 'The House That Would Not Die' (1970), 'Crawlspace' (1972), 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' and 'The Night Stalker' (both 1973), 'Trilogy of Terror' (1976; the one with the wee doll chasing Karen Black around) and so on, and 'The Conjuring' (2013) is basically another one of those (it's even set in 1971). Oh, it has a few bells and whistles (like CGI effects and some slick bigger-budget moves) but it's basically cut from the same cloth as some of the more mediocre ones I'd have seen back then (actually, those last three TV movies named are pretty good, and they're up on YouTube too). 'The Conjuring' has a large family moving into a big old haunted house (it's a cool-looking house, BTW) wherein they experience untoward goings-on and soon realise that it's haunted by the spirit of a nasty old witch. Complications follow, and so do a whole bunch of clichés and non-scariness. What's more is that the movie has an annoyingly conservative tone; for instance there is a distinctly pro-Christian stance to the story, to the point that when the evil entity is being vanquished a 'heavenly choir' soundtrack breaks out. I guess that's what happens when the mainstream finally takes notice of independent stuff; they scoop it up, dumb it down and sell it to the masses like it's something new. Ah well, that's the way the cookies crumble.",3,4,9,4 August 2013
The Breakfast Club," And they call this is a 'classic'.
","Somebody actually wrote this? A lot of it seems improvised, and not well. In fact, it almost seems like someone simply transcribed some bad improv and that became the script. Am I supposed to identify with anyone in this '80s Classic'? All of the characters are less than likable and none of them ring true. Is Ally Sheedy's character supposed to be autistic or something? Because otherwise I don't get it. Scenery-chewing Judd Nelson comes off less a troubled tough guy than a slightly flamboyant bitchy queen. And he looks a good ten years too old to be going to high school. Not only do the cast not talk like school students, they mostly don't even look like them. Although billed as a 'comedy', there's not a lot to crack a smile over, although when that nerdy kid dropped the news he'd been caught with a gun at school and the others automatically assumed he intended to kill himself, I had to laugh. These days kids don't bring guns to school to necessarily kill just themselves. Frankly what this dated piece of pointless pontification most closely resembles is one of those 'workshopped' plays in which irredeemably pretentious folk get to indulge themselves and create something truly painful. In this case, it is five cipher-characters who just will not shut up for a couple of hours. In lieu of a proper ending, we get a quick dance montage (note Emilio Estevez' total lack of dancing ability) and everyone is everyone's mate for some reason. And you know what? Turns out the smartest guy is the janitor. I hate this movie. There, I actually typed it.",1,64,126,12 December 2012
The Great Gatsby," The not-as-great-as-it-thinks-it-is 'Gatsby'
","My brother and his wife wanted to watch 'the Great Gatsby' in the comfort of their own home and so I downloaded a reasonably good copy (there was the silhouette of someone's head in the bottom left-hand corner throughout and somebody else got up and left an hour or so in, but it was otherwise pretty watchable) and saw it myself. Lots of money spent, lots of CGI, a lot of quick cutting (forcing a rapid pace), and frankly old sports, I didn't give a damn. None of the characters were engaging enough to warrant serious attention for the 143 minute running time, and the result was an over-stylised (modern hip-hop on the soundtrack, Leonardo DiCaprio's glassy demeanour and bizarre accent, etc.), emotionally vacuous two-hours- plus. I just didn't buy bland, mousy Carey Mulligan as someone for whom Gatsby would risk -and ultimately lose- everything, and Tobey Maguire's 'Nick Carraway' wasn't much more than a exposition plot device. Ah well, at least we got to see it over beer and snacks instead of a crowded, expensive night out at the cinema.",3,1,4,27 July 2013
