The King's Speech," An entertaining and well-made film
","After have longed to see this film for quite some time, but not had the 'strength' to do so, I finally told myself to watch it. Did I regret it? No, I did not.In The King's Speech you get to follow The Duke of York (a.k.a. Bertie) during his struggle with his stammering. During the film you get to see the relation between Bertie and the speech-therapist Lionel develop as well as the question to who will succeed King George V. The King's Speech is from time to time a rather slow movie filled with moments where you get both know the characters but also the magnificent things about this movie; the script, the filming and how the actors collaborate upon creating great scenes.Director Tom Hooper, in my opinion, succeeded with The King's speech. In addition I was very thrilled to see the way Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush filled the scenes with both emotion and intensity.Judged from what I had to say from above I am a fan of this film. An evening filled with laughter and sympathy but most importantly entertainment.",9,0,0,7 March 2015
