Skyfall," A good Bond, but not the best Bond.
","I was anticipating Skyfall a great deal, as i am a massive Bond fan and have always liked the traditional values of the films as well as the well written story lines. Daniel Craig, in my eyes, is perfect for the role of James Bond, sophisticated and cool, everything you need to be to play one of the most renowned spies in film. And he shows that again in this film, he was brilliant in the film. Skyfall is a good film, no doubt about it, however there are a few things with the film that make it fall just short of Casino Royale, which is highly regarded as the best Daniel Craig film. One of the flaws with this film is the one-liners, there are many in this film and it ruins the sophisticated and cool look of the James Bond franchise. Another is the role of Q, the actor who plays Q in this film isn't a strong enough actor, and whenever he is in a scene it takes you out of the submersive view that the film has put you in and back to reality. However this film is a good film and should definitely be seen, however if you're wanting to watch the best Bond movie ever, then this is most certainly not that. Try Goldfinger.",6,1,6,31 October 2012
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," A film that is just not worth watching - even for D fans
","Tenacious D are a good band, and there quite funny in that band.But in this film they are NOT funny.I didn't laugh once in this whole movie & it was just basically a huge let-down.Because i thought it would be a decent comedy because it was a film about Tenacious D and it obviously had them two in it.However...This film was poorly written, had scenes in it that didn't add any humour in to it just basically took up some time in the movie and made it even more of a waste of time.As well as this Tenacious D are great song writers however some of the 'songs' in this were poor, an awful soundtrack for an awful film.Even if you like Tenacious D, save your time, do not watch this movie!",5,3,8,23 May 2012
