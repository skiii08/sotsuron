The Blair Witch Project," This movie is, by far, the worst ever made.
","First of all, there was absolutely nothing good about this movie. It was not scary whatsoever. Supposedly a psychological thriller, I didn't have a single frightening thought enter my mind. The fact that these 2 unknown directors could make up a crappy legend, to go with a crappy plot and crappy actors that were supposedly not acting (yeah right), it's amazing the movie was so successful. I completely hated it. Without a doubt, I have never seen a movie so awful. If you want scary, go rent The Sixth Sense. There are a bunch of recent thrillers that have come out recently that are hundreds of times better than the Blair Witch Project. In fact, pretty much every movie ever made is better.",1,21,42,12 March 2001
Forrest Gump," Simply brilliant
","I had not seen 'Forrest Gump' in many months, but upon seeing it once again, I can't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours in front of the TV. The movie is perfectly done: everybody who you're supposed to like (Forrest, his mother, Lieutenant Dan, Bubba), you like; everybody who you're supposed to dislike (Jenny, Dan at the beginning of the movie), you dislike. In such a dramatic movie, it's amazing that it can still be so funny- or, in a comedic movie, it's amazing that it can still be so dramatic. The shots of war are brilliant, and it's easy to believe that the action is real. Tom Hanks played Forrest as well as he acted in any movie, and Sally Field did not get enough respect for her performance. I'm sure there are tons of people who can say something about 'Forrest' better than I can, but I've liked this movie since my early teens, and I still love it whenever I have the pleasure of viewing it.",10,1,2,7 May 2002
