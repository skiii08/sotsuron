Hereditary," 7.7 for THIS? The trailer was better than the move itself!
","I am not sure that people who are giving this movie 9 and 10 have even seen another decent horror movie. I was deceived by the good reviews and the decent trailer It started off pretty well, first few scenes were great, had good expectations. After that it was a snooze fest for more than an hour. Comparing it with 'The Shining', ' The Omen' and 'Exorcist' among others is utterly laughable. Great horror movies make you care about the characters, this is where the horror lies. In this movie I did not really care for a single person. The father was meek and weak. Anne was a complete psycho from the start, Peter was underdeveloped, the little brat was the worst. I kept expecting the ending to salvage some of the merits of the movie, but it was actually even more ridiculous and nonsensical. This was badly written, badly edited, badly presented. People weren't scared, they were bored and left dissapointed. The only decent horror I've seen so far this year is 'A Silent Place'. Don't waste your money on this mediocre piece.",2,1,4,28 June 2018
Annihilation," An..other dissapointment
","Another title I have to classify under 'Great idea/concept, terrible end product'. 
As many others have already said, this is a mess, full of pretty visuals, philosophy and psychology, yet devoid of real substance. I am not sure that even the crew, director and actors knew what they were aiming for. Is is a thriller? A horror? A drama? Sci-fi? I can only tell you what it wasn't-deep and existentialist, as they most probably wanted it to be. Too many plot holes, some phenomenal in its scope lazy writing. People already mentioned why there is almost no logic and common sense to be found in the scientific team's actions and motives, I am not gonna repeat it. Oh, the idea behind the movie was more than promising. But instead of making a decent Sci-Fi action movie with some thriller and horror elements, or to fully go for a deeper, more philosophic film, something like Arrival or Solaris, they went for a mix of all these, failing completely to present a finished and polished end product. Plus, the pace at time was unbearably slow, further killing any joy from the movie. I give it 5 stars only because of the nice visuals, the likeable (but not memorable enough) character of the biologist, and the great premise, even though I felt dissapointed at the end.",6,0,2,18 August 2018
