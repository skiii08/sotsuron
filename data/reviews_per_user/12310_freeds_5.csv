Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Excrement-loaded exercise in moronic humor
","Sacha Baron Cohen defecates on the heads of U.S. (and other) audiences and many of them love it! This excrement-loaded exercise in moronic humor sets a new low point in the 'epater le bourgeois' genre. 'Borat' is so palpably dishonest that no sensible observer can give any credence to its manufactured 'exposures' of U.S. bigotry and bloodthirstiness. Any competent documentarian would have little difficulty filming AUTHENTIC versions of the film's counterfeit 'candid camera' diatribes against Muslims, Jews, blacks, women and Iraqis and packaging these in an edifying vehicle. The actual exposure of U.S. depravity is not provided by 'Borat' but, rather, by the adulatory utterances of the professional (i.e. jaded, sold-out) film 'critics.' Those who found this film 'uproariously funny' or 'superbly satirical' damned themselves for their abysmal judgment and taste.There's nothing really new here, of course. Hasn't Hollywood's movie 'Academy' covered itself with shame through its long-term, nauseating worship of films exalting human cruelty and brutality? The successful career of a Martin Scorsese, for example, would not be possible in a humane and just society.Barry Freed",1,20,41,26 December 2006
BlacKkKlansman," Exciting mash-up of dangerous lies and important truth about racism
","'Black KKKlansman' is based on the memoir of a black former cop. The job of police (black and white alike) is to keep workers and the oppressed in line on behalf of the owning class, with blacks at the bottom as a special target of state brutality from slavery on. While spying on the Klan in the '70s with the help of a white colleague, the black cop also infiltrated the multiracial, worker-oriented Progressive Labor group. Police historically disrupt progressive organizations, while generally protecting those of racists and fascists -- the rulers' reserve army. Over and over they cover for individual cop acts of racist brutality. How does Spike Lee handle these facts? He ignores his hero's work against PL and invents an episode in which the police department opposes a racist in its ranks. The movie does show racism (still) rampaging, stoked by the rulers' present front man. Against this unavoidable truth, the filmmaker counterposes messages and protests rejecting hate. Their wishful moralizing is about as useful as a silk shirt against a bullet. Our defense depends not on cops, or mockery of the racists, or 'love,' but on the power of the multiracial working class. A new rating is in order: This exciting entertainment for anti-racists should be viewed through class-reality lenses. Rita Freed",4,32,71,24 September 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Powerful film, blinkered vision (shared by reviewers)
","Reviews of this powerful, strongly-acted but partly blind film divide along predictable political lines. Many point out that the escalating violence of the bitter bereaved mother and the racist junior cop are writer-director-producer McDonagh's preferred style and are as unlikely as the relative saintliness of the 'billboarded' police chief and other characters. These commenters deny U.S. society's racism, police brutality, homophobia, sexism and hostility to outsiders that the film reflects. On the other hand, liberal reviewers applaud both its accurate echo of our daily headlines and its fairytale image of 'common humanity' ending hate (despite all history to the contrary). The extreme social pathology of the U.S. has a material source: a rapacious, violent, world-striding system cloaked in hypocrisy. Only some awareness of this reality could ground a more believable narrative of characters driven to extremes.R. Freed",6,1,2,24 March 2018
Ratatouille," An earthy delight
","I will never look at the humble title dish the same way again. Beautifully artistic, non-cutesy animation, charming music and vocal characterizations, witty, snappy dialogue that is MUCH too sophisticated for children, TWO simultaneous success stories (1: true talent will out; 2: oaf makes good), a rocky-road-to-love story starring a very gutsy female, a terrifying but ultimately soft-hearted food critic, a cultured arch-villain, the mad competition for restaurant star ratings, overcoming the barriers of inter-species mutual mistrust and — above all — a celebration of those greatest of human inventions: good food and wine. What more could one ask? (A film of deeper social significance, perhaps, which explains my 9 instead of 10 rat-ing.) If you don't love this film you probably are dead.One thing I haven't figured out: why did the rats come in two colors, brown and bluish-gray? Will someone please explain the significance?OK, where's that zucchini . . .Barry Freed",9,4,6,5 October 2007
12 Years a Slave," The basic falsehood within '12 Years a Slave'
","'12 Years a Slave' is a gripping, mostly well-made, but basically false film. To say it finally shows the brutal truth about U. S. chattel slavery just proves how blind opinion-shapers are about U.S. racism, past and present.Was the main outrage of slavery really that it could engulf a cultured, free black individual? That's what the hero suggests when, speaking to a sympathetic white, he protests the injustice of HIS captivity. As an afterthought, he also observes that slavery in general is unjust. Several of the other slaves with whom he interacts are inexplicably well-spoken and the camera lingers repeatedly on their faces to remind us of their stoic nobility.The filmmaker shows keen understanding of psychological nuance in the relationships between masters, other whites, and slaves. He evidently meant to evoke viewer empathy with victims who seem to be a lot like 'us.' This film is meant to make liberals feel good about 'our' distance from that world. It predictably has outraged some reactionaries who don't like exposing the warts of U.S. 'democracy.'The main truth of U.S. slavery is not the story of extraordinary individuals either as victims or avengers but of ordinary people brutalized and traumatized, accommodating and finally resisting the private appropriation of their persons and their labor. The film that tells this truth won't be made until all those who labor, black and white, start speaking for themselves.Rita Freed",4,75,149,1 December 2013
