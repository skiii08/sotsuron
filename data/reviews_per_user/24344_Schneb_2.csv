Raiders of the Lost Ark," DVD Lacks Detail Care and Proper Mix
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of my top ten movies (were talking Ten Commandments and Ben Hur here). But the attention to detail and cleanup was very low on this DVD. In fact, the Laserdisk versions seems to be better. Here is what I found in viewing the Raiders DVD.Opening scene, when Indy enters the cave, the frame shifts. Did anyone at LucasFilm even see this? This is easily fixed in the studio, how did these pros miss this!?When talking to the feds in the university chapel, there is a two to three frame jump cut. Hello? This too is easy to fix, and I caught it after one viewing. We are talking basic quality control here. Who restored this film, high schoolers?Someone else mentioned this, and I want to second it. The 5.1 mix is very poorly done. I had to crank my center channel to hear the dialog. When Marion slugs Indy, I barely even heard it. The mixer was going for realism, but the original mix was for a melodramatic, 'serial' effect. This from the creators of THX and Skywalker Sound?There were several scenes where dirt was on the camera lense protection glass. How hard is it to eliminate those large, out-of-focus blotches?I would have liked to have seen a little computer magic done in other places as well. A couple examples would be removing the reflection of the cobra in the glass that protected Harrison and Karen in the Well of Souls. The other would be eliminating the push-rod that flips the truck in Cairo.A few reviewers mention scenes or audio that is cut. I did not see any of these cuts on the Widescreen version. What I saw was the entire movie that I remember seeing in 1981.Dear LucasFilm, please provide (not in a collector set!) a SuperBit version of Raiders of the Lost Ark with DTS. Remix according to a film print and find people who can detect even the most BASIC flaws or errors. Let's hope the original Star Wars trilogy is treated with a little more detail and care.",Null,0,0,28 October 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," Cinematography Ruined Great Plot
","For those of us with Home Theater systems, Bourne Supremacy was more distraction than attraction. First, has Hollywood completely abandoned the use of the tripod and dolly altogether? Every single shot was hand-held with dizzying motion. It was so bad, that was all we were thinking about throughout the film. 'He's dialing a phone! Quick, move the camera to add tension!' 'So why not have multiple fast zooms in and out with a big orchestral sting?' (-4 for 90s TV camera-work) I had to check this problem on my computer to make sure my projector wasn't out of alignment. My computer confirmed that this entire movie is predominately green. Oliver Wood seems to had forgotten his Tiffen FL-D fluorescent filter on the initial shoot. Did he do the entire film in green to avoid this embarrassing miscue?(-2 for Star Trek I color lapse) The plot was excellent, but I thought the death of Franka was a typical Hollywood motivational formula worthy of a Simpsons spoof. If the motivation was to protect Franka, the movie would have been far better. (-1 for Mask of Zorro motivation) I am giving the movie a three rating for these glaring errors. Six points lost for cinematography alone.",3,2,4,28 December 2004
