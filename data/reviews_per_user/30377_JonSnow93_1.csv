Iron Man 3," Worst Iron man of the 3
","Okay so i went to see Iron Man 3 last night excited as any comic book fan would be but i left the cinema disappointed. I had high hope after The Avengers and wanted to see what Marvel had to offer and it did not live up to the hype. The film might as well have been called Tony Starke because he is rarely in the suit. The whole thing with the kid was ridiculous, i do not know what Shane Black was thinking when he made this film. It was worst than Iron Man 2 and i thought that film was bad. Robert Downey Jr as always puts in a great performance as Tony Starke its just a shame the same cant be said for the rest of the cast. Don Cheadle who i like was ruined by the director in this movie jumping out the suit in a polo,jeans and trainers was quite ridiculous and also the scene at the end with the president was just so unrealistic. Paltrow resumes her role well except the ending which i felt there was no need for. Pearce puts in a great performance as always but like i have said before the director ruins it.The whole Mandarin thing was terrible after aliens turn up in Avengers surely they could do the real Mandarin from the comics as he is Iron Man's arch enemy. Don't bother watching the post credit scene nothing special is shown.Overall great acting all round,some laughs but i felt the movie needed more action and more Tony Starke in the suit. In my opinion the director Shane Black has put a damp mark on the Iron Man franchise for me.Worst Marvel production film to date and can only hope Thor can save my hopes in Marvels phase 2 plans.",4,82,169,27 April 2013
