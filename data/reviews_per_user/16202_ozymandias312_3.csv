Vertigo," 'What Dreams May Come?'
","One reviewer back there mentioned holes in the plot that seem to keep the film from making complete sense.  Probably the only way _Vertigo_ really makes sense is if Scotty *did* fall and *really died*. And all the rest is some long and terrible, perhaps purgatorial, dream that comes to him in that sleep of death. Like in Hamlet's famous soliloquy: To die, to sleep;/ To sleep:perchance to dream; ay, there's the/  rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may/  come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil/ Must give us pause... -- Hamlet, Act III, Scene I, Lines 65-71.  On this theory _Vertigo_ might be best compared to 1990's  _Jacob's Ladder_.",10,2,3,16 December 2001
The Mummy," Too Much Funny, Not Enough Scary
","I like my monster movies to be more scary than funny. They need to be played pretty straight to work. I had a problem with the dialogue and the 'attitude' of the principle characters as well. It was anachronistic -- too much 1999, not enough 1923-'26. Still, it has its moments. Some of the fights are fairly rousing, even if the style of gunplay is a bit fanciful. The big final battle in the tomb, where the hero has finally run completely out of ammunition, and has to fall back on cold steel, or cold bronze, as the case may be, is interesting and a little reminiscent of the big sword fight with the skeleton army in 1963's _Jason and the Argonauts-, which probably inspired it.",Null,0,0,27 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Farther Away From Tolkien
","I noticed the departures from the book more, and minded them more, this time around than I did in _Fellowship of the Ring_. _The Two Towers_  seemed to depart further from not only the letter but from the *spirit* of the book as well. Nevertheless, it's a good, entertaining movie, and well worth seeing.",8,0,0,18 December 2002
