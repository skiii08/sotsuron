Requiem for a Dream," I Have Never Seen A Drug-Addict Film Better Portrayed
","Now to say the truth, I wasn't at all excited to see this film. I am a little late at watching films and this film was in front of me for a while. All my friends saw it and they all said that the film was awful, and a real 'Bummer'- to quote one of my colleagues. I just watched this film and I had to post my comment on the IMDB. This film is amazing. I particularly liked the music, it was full of feeling-two thumbs up for Clint Mansel. (Spoiler so watch out and skip this paragraph if you don't like them) Now from the start of the film you see three teenagers/young adults who are junkies and you could tell from the start that this isn't going to have a happy ending. As you keep on watching you understand every character more clearly as Director Darren Aronofsky clearly brings images of clear memory or hallucinations of each member of the circle. The idea of Harry's mother (Ellen Burstyn -beautifully played by the way)getting addicted to amphetamines is also a mark of a good-tailored screenplay and novel, proving that not all junkies are kids and that reasons aren't important for drug-addiction. What took my attention was the way the director portrayed the feeling of being on drugs and an addict without them. It was masterful, I liked this film a lot and I think that Anyone who has a soft spot for tragic movies should try this one. (I give this film a 9 out of 10)",10,0,1,8 December 2003
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Milestone in American Film-Making
","It has been awhile since I watched a film and became fully sympathetic and supportive of the views and message that it conveys. The movie is actually well-written, concise and to-the-point (all of which conveys good journalism) which assists in generating the aura of the film. During these times, we have lost touch of the positive and productive role of television or media in general, that is enlightenment, education and culturing and not just pleasure and entertainment. This film is not just about journalism, the freedom to speak and convey ideas or documenting the medial foundation for the constitutional rights of the American citizen, its much deeper than that. I believe that it tells us subliminally, that the current ignorance, fear and unreadiness towards terrorism is due to the inability of journalism to enlighten and broaden the horizons of the viewers to current issues, policies -whether they be homeland or external, and actions the American government carries out which may or may not be in the interest of its people. The closing speech at the end of the film suggests this. It is the responsibility of the media to pass on this information in a consistent and productive manner so as to ready the viewers for the possibilities and outcomes. Good Night, and Good Luck. :)",9,1,2,17 March 2006
The Last Samurai," One of the Best Films I've Seen in a While
","Although I may appear biased, I am a sucker for a film which talks about a certain code of ethics -especially if its a japanese one! This film is not the best of its kind, and neither the writer nor the director could fully convey the way of the japanese people. I'm not an expert but I've seen my share of japanese films (and some chinese and korean and I don't mean action movies). I would say that this film is probably one of the closest American films that could grasp -if any at all, the culture of a foreign nation. I would also like to state for the record that the american cinema has been pretty weak for about 5 years now and this is probably one of the few films that I liked since that time (I don't even have to start and mention the awfull fashions of sequels and remakes of old films).I couldn't find a better or worse person than Tom Cruize to take the role of Captain Nathan Algren. His facial feature are excellent for the role but his integrity as an actor I find low (except for his roles in 'A Few Good Men' and 'Rain Man'). This made me lose some of the seriousness I would have found in his role were it not him playing it. Still, I have to salute Tom for his decision in taking this role -its a good one. People might say that this film tried to convey more than its worth and some may even say that tries to force out a tear or two but I would have to say that although part of that is correct, I couldn't help but think that this film is the first I've seen which could touch the japanese people so close and that is the truth. Any way I really liked the film and i would recommend it to anyone who loves war movies that are filled with sacrifce and honor.",10,1,2,23 January 2004
