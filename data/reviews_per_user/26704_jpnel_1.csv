50 First Dates," Quit Complaining about plots, this is meant to entertain
","Considering I deal with a lot of writing depth, often mature material and research, and watch lots of serious and engrossing plots ... sometimes I want to unwind with something I don't have to think about a lot, but can make me laugh. The so - called critics, whose jibs I have read here, have probably never performed in public, published any literature, or studied drama. Adam is generally a goof in his parts. But have any of you ever diliberated on how difficult it can be to do any kind of comedy? He makes you laugh. If you don't like his brand of humor, don't watch. This particular film I enjoyed because not only was it light, but if you are intelligent enough to know what to look for you can tell he has a lot of range in his ability. Sure, he is goofy, but he has a lot of ability in those moments he actually shows emotion through his eyes and facial expression. Drew had some good moments as well. As to Sean, I can only imagine he had a blast just letting go and not having to be a lead. Anyone who doubts his ability doesn't have to watch his Hobbit, go back and watch 'Rudy'. Oh well, there is always going to be complainers. I watched, I liked, and now own a copy of this film.",9,0,0,27 April 2005
