The New World," Very historically accurate
","Many of the artifacts found in the Jamestown dig were represented. The fort was very accurate, and the well - to placement and location.I liked the scene where it showed some of the colonists looking for gold - that was the general mindset that a lot of them had on the voyage over. Notice the brief shot of the glass firing bowl and furnace. The venetian beads, the hatchets. Great costumes, but at least 20 minutes too long.One thing I did like was the educational resources on the website. They are nice for homeschoolers.It seemed like kinda a chick flick - but as a chick flick could have stood a few more cute little native baby shots. Those were adorable, and helped the boredom factor some.The cinematography was great all around. The focus on the trees when Captain John Smith was in the water before he was captured showed the same trees that a core sample was taken from that proved the colonists settled during the worst drought in hundreds of years in Virginia. It was just....boring.......but only because it was too long.",7,1,4,26 February 2006
