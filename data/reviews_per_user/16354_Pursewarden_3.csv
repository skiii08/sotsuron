Minority Report," Great SciFi, bad Mistery, no A.I.
","First, I must say I disagree with the previous posting. Minority Report should have been one of the year's best films. As I was watching it I thought it was one of the best Scifi movies I had seen in a while and then Spielberg lost his touch. I agree that the movie rises some deep moral questions, as most of Phillip Dick's stories, that is one of the wonderful things in this gender and a point dutiful achieved by Spielberg in A.I. But Minority Report is not only a SciFi film but also a thriller, and it is as that that the film runs into faults that go beyond celuloid redemption (if I am allowed the such metaphor). SPOILER ALERT ---the following points will give away important points of the story, beware readers that haven't seen it. As I was saying, the film is a thriller and it suddenly runs into big holes: 1. Why does the PRECRIME police arrest Tom Cruise's character after he allegedly murdered the FBI guy? Wouldn't that be a job for the regular police? 2. Spielberg uses the worst cliche resource to solve the mistery. The killer gives himself away with the old loudmouth trick: he says too much to the wrong person. Its been seen in a thousand movies before (many of them TV of the week flicks) and it's a cheap scene in the context of the movie. 3. Afther it the old recorder in the pocket trick is much worst. 4. The ending also is not consistent. If the precogs predicted the crime it should have happened: they never missed until then. 5. This future society must have been advanced in advertising, prepolice, marketing and traffic design. But they lacked the most simple police techniques. In the murder of the FBI agent the killer uses a gun (Tom Cruise's) that was in the Police's custody since the first guy is shot by Cruise. It would be impossible for the Cruise character to use that same gun to kill somebody else. Summing up, there are many other little missed points in the film. I don't know what was a genius like Spielberg thinking in this ending. It felt as some of those alternate endings you find in DVD-extras gladly because you know they were left on the editing-room floor.",8,0,0,20 August 2002
The Village," Forget the twist
","The big problem of M. Night Shyamalan movies is that he created this twist ending trademark. If by all means any movie that spots 'surprise ending' will end up spoiling it since everyone in the audience is going to be expecting something, the game enters an endless and stupid fight of egos. The director trying to show how smart he is pulling up surprises, and the audience anticipating anyhow. Thus most movie reviews of THE VILLAGE speak about the not so surprising ending, the disappointing surprise, etc. Well if the movie was JUST the surprise, it would, certainly, be a waste with a better place as a Twilight Show chapter. But THE VILLAGE is much more than a twist ending. If you enter the theater understanding you are probably not going to be surprised and let the burden of surprise out of the movie, then you have a very good suspenseful, and enjoyable, drama with a few minor scares. One played wonderfully by the cast (except maybe Brody, going over the top), and with a very subtly direction by Shyamalan. If there is a future for this director, he should forget the success of the SIXTH SENSE and try to focus into storytelling, something he does better than four fifths of today's directors.",8,0,0,17 September 2004
Van Helsing," Dumb mishmash
","Stephen Sommers latest is an attempt to profit in the line previously taken by 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' but, of course, with a twist. (I may mention a couple of **spoilers** but this movie is spoiled on origin).Van Helsing (the mythical vampire killer of Bram StokerÂ´s Dracula) is sort of an immortal slayer searching for monsters (in the first minutes he does Mr. Hyde) to kill with weaponry a la James Bond for the nineteen century. He is cleverly sidekicked with a comic-relief frail to feed him with clever weapons for every season).He meets Beckingsale, a sort of Rumanian warrior part of a clan fighting Dracula for centuries (which V.H. is sent to help to avoid 9 generations of her family skipping Heaven-as dumb as it sounds). Full of CGI and a plot so contrived that keeps the audience laughing where it attempts to thrill, this idiotic mishmash is a definite must avoid for anyone with enough braincells to read the title.Dracula and his women have caves full of 'eggs' (suspiciously looking like ALIEN cocoons) and are looking for the way for them to live, so they all can dominate the earth (it's never clear why they just don't simply bite a few thousand peasants to populate the region with vampires), and they somehow understand that by using Dr.Frankenstein's machine with a werewolf they can canalize electricity into the ugly cocoons to spawn a few thousand little green demons (that look like suspiciously like the gargoiles from the Hunchback of Notre Dame). The mummy was bad, but was popcorn-watchable-if-you-don't-have-anything-else-to-do, he has gone beyond: this is his worst yet, but we must wonder if his next: Van Helsing II: the mummy of the Louvre, won't go further down.",1,0,1,6 May 2004
