Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the best films of the saga
","The Phantom Menace is a prequel to Star Wars episode 4,5 and 6.Its about the Trade federation that put a blockade over the planet Naboo and two Jedi are sent to settle negotiations but they are nearly killed.I enjoyed this film very much.Jar-Jar and Darth Maul are my favourite characters and Ewan Mc Gregger,Liam Neeson and Natle Portman were very good in it.Darth Maul only had three lines and didn't show in the film that much but Jar-Jar made me laugh a lot.Some of the acting was terrible and the person who played Anikan couldn't even act.I just hope this film isn't ruined by a remake.",9,10,14,3 November 2007
"I, Robot"," Creative,but gets far-fetched at times
","I find this movie creative and far-fetched.I think it's creative because it is set in the year 2023 and robots have been invented.I think it's far-fetched because it seemed that the makers were trying to make the film longer by adding some stuff that wasn't necessary.It's about this scientist or doctor who designs a more up to date version of the other robots.When the scientist happens to commit suicide one detective gets very suspicious about the new robots and tries to find the missing answers to the scientist's death.When the new robots get delivered to the city,they have a revolution and set up a curfew.The detective tries to shut down the main machine but will he succeed?I enjoyed this movie,but I found a bit of it far-fetched and made me give it a seven.I,Robot can keep many entertained with the action.Will Smith put on a good performance as usual.Recommended to Will Smith fans ,sci-fi fans and if you liked the movie 'Robots'.I thought it was great,but I didn't love it.",7,3,4,21 March 2008
Singin' in the Rain," Shouldn't be ruined by a remake
","Singn' in the rain is an unforgettable musical that still entertains people today.It is based in the year 1927 when talkie movies come in and one film company is struggling to get their movies right and try to dub their squeaky-voiced actress.When one of the actors named Don falls into a car when trying to escape from fans he meets a woman who mistakes him for a robber and he has to explain to her that he is a famous actor. She introduces herself and says that she is a stage actress.Don later introduces her to the film company and they try to find a way of dubbing the squeaky-voiced actress in secret....Singn' in the rain basically shows you what silent films are like and how loads of mistakes were made when talkies came in (you know, when new things come in they can't be perfect all the time).The performances and songs were excellent.This movie is Fun for whole family and is a must see for musical fans that have not seen it yet.This is a movie that dose not deserve to be ruined by a remake.",10,1,2,9 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A very entertaining sci-fi film
","I found this film very entertaining from start to finish, There was good performances from the cast and the effects were brilliant.It's about a bunch of rebels fighting against the evil empire and are trying to restore freedom to the galaxy. In one battle one droid called R2-D2 is sent on a secret mission with the stolen plans of the Death Star. With his friend C3-PO they escape the battle and go to the planet Tatooine. They then meet Luke Skywalker and little does Luke know that his life will change for ever.I found this film very entertaining and I think it always will be. George Lucas must have a big imagination to have been able to put this film together. I think that this film is an all time classic and is one of the best films in the world and the Star Wars saga.",9,0,0,27 December 2008
The Simpsons Movie," I'm sorry but was I supposed to laugh?
","What is so good about this movie?I saw it a first time and thought it was hilarious but the second time time really puts you off on seeing another cartoon movie.I like the Simpsons but this movie shows nothing special about the T.V show,in fact it is just a normal episode except it is longer and gets worst every time.I don't know what gave me the nerve to watch it again but it was like torture.It is about everyones favourite character Homer Simpson who gets the town in trouble by the government because he pours pig dung into the lake witch causes pollution.The town gets really mad and the family have to run away and hide,but how?the town is trapped in a bubble and they have to escape.I began to hate this movie when I saw it a second time because nothing was funny anymore.And I say you're thinking that I have no sense of humour but the first time I saw it I laughed my head off but the second time made me bored stiff.Simpsons fans will be disappointed or maybe they won't but I'm one unhappy Simpsons fan.",1,12,19,18 February 2008
The Wizard of Oz," The book is better
","When I read the book by L.Frank Baum I became a fan of it the and wanted to see this movie because I was astonished with the mystical land of Oz.The wizard of Oz is about a girl called Dorethy who gets trapped in her house during a storm and ends up in a strange land with her dog called Toto.There,she has to follow a yellow brick road that leads to an emerald city so she can meet the wizard of Oz.On her journey, she meets a scarecrow that wants a brain,a tin man that wants a heart and a cowardly lion that wants courage.A few annoying songs can drive you insane but there is no real hassle because there is a good plot and the acting is decent enough.The only bad thing is it doesn't show how hard they traveled to the emerald city like it dose in the book and the length it took for Dorethy to get to the good witch of the north.The wicked witch of the west,I have to say has a very sensitive hate of water because a small splash killed her.I'm giving it 6/10 for a reason. And that reason is the book by L.Frank Baum really explains the story and this movie just didn't explain enough.A few laughs made me give it 6 but if I were you I would read the book,watch the movie and then write the review.This is a movie that is recommend to people who are fans of movies that were made in the 30's.",6,4,16,10 February 2008
