It," Great Storyline
",Great story and captured the audience to follow with each character someone everyone can relate with as a kid. I haven't seen a thriller/horror movie in a long time and I have no clue what possessed me to watch this one. Overall it was worth it! Reminds me a lot of the Goonies. I would definitely recommend watching this one.,9,3,5,20 September 2017
