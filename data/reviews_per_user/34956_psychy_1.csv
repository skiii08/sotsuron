The Ring," Great film but ending was too open ended
","This movie had tons of shock value with disturbing images, I'll give it that. It also proves that a movie these days doesn't have to have tons of gore and death to be scary. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat more or less for the whole movie. By the time it got towards the end my heart was literally pounding, wondering if she was going to die or live. One great comment I have about this movie is how it leads you on that it's over. It makes you feel comfortable by giving you that warm feeling of seeing the kid's mother and father holding hands and then cuts to the scene with the kid's dad. The ONLY gripe I really have about the movie is how open-ended the ending is. It just leaves too much out and doesn't even really give you a solid clue of what happens after the end. It doesn't even really give you enough to think about to try and form your own hypothesis. I probably would've given the move a 9 if there was more closure at the end. Still a GREAT film and I highly recommend it to anyone.",9,1,1,23 March 2004
