Skyfall," Disappointing
","I ran out to see this film because the reviews have been so enthusiastic here in the US. I loved Casino Royale, the only Bond film that I truly liked, but QOS was so bad that I wasn't sure what to expect here. Sadly, this film did not live up to expectations, and I can point to the exact moment this film went downhill: the introduction of Javier Bardem's clownish, cartoonish, over-the-top villain, Silva. Casino Royale gave us a baddie, Le Chifre, who was smooth and deadly but also grounded in reality. The Silva character is unwatchable. He whines about M having betrayed him, makes a pass at Bond, puts in motion a silly cat-and-mouse game that makes no sense, and comes across as someone so out of touch with reality that it's hard to see him as a criminal mastermind with a cadre of capable men working for him. You would think some of them would start to notice that the boss had a few too many screws loose and would cut and run. The plot takes a nosedive with Silva's introduction and even the action sequences loose luster. No cool parqour (sp?)sequences or tension- filled poker game of wits. I was surprised how bored I became as the film dragged on. Even the climatic sequence, which is set in Bond's abandoned family estate in remote Scotland, is tedious, unoriginal, and flat-out boring. Rarely has a Bond film ending been so anti-climatic and ho-hum. Although there are some nice elements in this film that give one hope for future installments, such as the introduction of a younger, tech savvy Quartermaster or 'Q' and Ralph Fiennes as a bureaucrat initially at odds with M., overall this is a mediocre film, which saddens me as Craig's version of Bond is still my favorite.",5,10,31,9 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Strike One
","5 seems harsh, but on a scale of 1 to 10, it really does, or should, mean take it or leave it. This movie was bland and boring, and this is coming from someone who watches Collider Jedi Council and has read most of the new canon novels, including 'Catalyst,' the book that sets up this story. The characters in this movie are very forgettable save for Donnie Yen's blind monk or guardian of the whills character. He at least shows varied emotions. Everyone else is one-note. Story-wise, this movie is very choppy as we're dragged from one locale to the other. I wish they'd stayed on Jedda and perhaps used that planet as a base for recruiting old Force worshipers/believers and training them to be a fighting force a la 'The Dirty Dozen' or 'The Magnificent Seven.' TFA had its problems, but at least the first act was great and most of the new characters were likable and memorable. There's fan service galore in this movie, but all that did was remind me of how rich and fulfilling the OT is. I honestly can't imagine anyone but a SW nerd liking this movie.",5,10,19,16 December 2016
Lords of Dogtown," Beautifully shot, wonderful performances
","I just came from seeing this film. Even though I'm a mid-30s So Cal female, I must admit I knew nothing of the Z-boys and wouldn't have even thought of seeing this movie if the reviews weren't as positive as they are. I actually purchased the fabulous soundtrack first (all '70s era hard rock hits) and then saw the movie. It's wonderful. The look of the film is gritty and very realistic, including beautiful shots of surfers surfing in between the pylons of an old abandoned pier. The three teen-aged boys that form the heart of the story are given distinct personalities and are well developed. This is a coming of age story in many ways, but done realistically and without the lectures. The boys deal with their new found fame in different ways, which has consequences for their future lives. There's also a very emotional storyline involving the boys' fourth friend. The casting is superb. They're unknown to me, but I was caught up in their performances. Their youthful bravado and irreverence are infectious. Heath Ledger's character is a bit unsavory, but he disappears into the role. It was beautifully filmed, had fine direction, wonderful dialog, was fast paced, and had a kick-a$$ soundtrack. To sum it up, I never skateboarded in my life, but this movie makes me feel as if I missed something really cool.",9,0,11,5 June 2005
Madagascar," Cute for kiddies but not the kid in me.
","I was rather disappointed with this film. As an adult, I found the film mediocre overall. The jokes were not very funny and I found the voice-overs rather bland (especially for 'Alex' the lion), with the exception of David Schwimmer. My interest in the story lessened considerably when the animals left New York and arrived in Madagascar. I think the film would have been better if the animals had decided to make a break for Connecticut or Montana rather than having them be shipped off to Africa. The scene-stealers were the penguins, who were quite amusing, and the best sequence in the entire movie was the opening shot of a chorus of penguins singing 'Born Free.' While watching the film, I kept hoping the main characters would leave and the penguins would return. The littlest tykes in the theater seemed to enjoy this a bit, but adults will find it not worth their while.",6,11,23,1 June 2005
127 Hours," Good book material perhaps, but...
","this film was slow and rather tedious. The best parts of the movie were the first 5 minutes or so, when we see the 'hero' cavorting in the outdoors amidst beautiful scenery, and the last 5 minutes or so, when the he cuts off his arm to free himself and encounters shocked and horrified hikers. Despite the notoriety surrounding the particular incident depicted in this film, it's still essentially a survival story. That genre isn't exactly new, but the director here fees he has to do something different so instead of focusing on the build-up of the character we get endless, moody flashbacks that are essentially irrelevant and uninteresting and serve only to take us out of the moment. I was somewhat confused as to what exactly the main character did for a living. Did he work in some sporting goods store? If so, why not introduce the character showing him giving good advice to customers (i.e., don't hike alone, tell family and friends where you're going, etc.) and then contrast that with his own rash behavior as he set off alone.And we never see the incident from another's perspective, such as the rescue personnel, the doctors, or even the hikers who discover the injured man. Why not build up the moment when hikers come across the injured Ralston. As audience members, we can never know Ralston's pain and suffering, but we can put ourselves in the place of the hikers who found and helped Ralston. Their shock, horror, and confusion, would be palpable and understandable, but instead those people are just an afterthought. This film focuses entirely on the thoughts and feelings of Ralston, and that's a weakness. James Franco is fine as Aaron Ralston, but the script and the direction lets him down.",5,6,12,5 February 2011
Creed," Good but a bit overrated.
","I've seen all the 'Rocky' films and found them enjoyable but I would not call myself a big fan of the franchise. I wanted to see this film because of the high praise it was receiving. While I agree it's a good movie, I don't think it's a great movie. Sly Stallone is excellent as is Jordan in the title role. But, I didn't find the movie as memorable as I would have wanted and that's mostly because the motivations of the lead character, Adonis Johnson (Creed) aren't all that clear or believable. At the onset we're introduced to a hardscrabble young Adonis, bastard son of late, great Apollo Creed, who's been in and out of foster homes but is whisked away by Apollo's wife to live a life of luxury. He's well-educated and has a white-collar job in the financial services industry. Why he decides to up and leave all that behind and pursue a life as a professional boxer is inexplicable. He says it's because he's been fighting his whole life but that assertion rings hollow when we see him pulling into the driveway of the huge gated estate that he shares with his 'mom.' When Adonis first meets up with Rocky Balboa, a scene that should be charged with emotion and nostalgia falls flat because Adonis already knows all the stories, having been told them by Apollo's wife. He knows more than Rocky does and the reveal that he's Apollo's son just isn't that dramatic. The romantic story line also falls a bit flat at Adonis is paired up with a clichéd character: hot and alluring singer. One of the aspects of 'Rocky' that was so wonderful was the atypical romantic story line, where Rocky is paired with a mousy, decidedly unglamorous woman who slowly emerges from her shell. Rocky and Adrian's relationship felt real and the famous 'Adrian!!!' cry packed an emotional wallop. Finally, the main event lacked emotional punch because I actually felt for the opponent, a working-class Briton who was facing the probability of a lengthy prison sentence and having to leave his young children behind.The story would have been much more interesting and emotionally engaging if Adonis had been raised by his working-class mother and perhaps only learned who his real father was upon her deathbed. That would have been a believable impetus for Adonis to seek out Rocky Balboa, to learn about his father and connect with him through Rocky, and train to become a champion like him. The scene in the restaurant and in the various gyms would have worked so much better if Adonis was hearing and learning about his biological father for the first time. And , I would have been more emotionally vested in the outcome of the main event if I'd truly seen Adonis overcome major hurdles. But, despite the flaws in the story, this was a well-made and well-acted film and I did enjoy it for what it was.",7,4,11,26 November 2015
Spotlight," Solid Film Lacking Dramatic Punch
","This was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch cast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends.",7,93,186,13 December 2015
The Expendables," As Tired and Worn Out as its Star/Director
","The only reason I'm giving this a 4 is because, unlike the turgid RED, this old-guys-back-in-the-saddle tale is somewhat enlivened by the chemistry between the 'actors.' But, for the most part, everyone's worn out and tired, including a plot that wouldn't have been believable in the 80s and is even less so today. An island in the Gulf of Mexico has been taken over by drug lords and a rouge CIA agent and the US government doesn't go in with guns blazing? Grenada, anyone? There's a bit of fun in seeing some of the old guys kick butt, but character and plot development are lost amid the mind-numbing explosions and endless gun battles. A Swede (Dolf Lundgren), a Chinese (Jet Li), a Brit (Statham) are on the same team as Stallone and other Americans, but there's no explanation of how this motley United Nations black-ops crew came into being. Of the 'stars,' only Stallone and Statham have the opportunity to generate any chemistry, but we learn next to nothing about them. Statham is, in fact, the standout in this film. He, along with Jet Li, is far from over-the-hill and brings a certain contemporary street cred to this otherwise mediocre film.",4,1,5,26 November 2010
The Way Back," Good but runs out of steam at the end
","I had avoided seeing this movie for some time because the critics had not been too kind to it. But I finally gave it a chance and am glad I did. It's a long journey, but what kept me interested were the spectacular visuals and the fact that I liked the little group of disparate characters that had banded together. It didn't matter that individual character development was slight; I liked the 'group.' I was particularly pleased that the film didn't resort to the cliché of having a traitor emerge who sells out the group. This group were decent people (even Coin Farrell's criminal has some honor) and they didn't turn on each other. When members succumbed to the elements it was because they simply couldn't withstand the physical punishment anymore, not because the other group members had cheated them out of their share of food or left them behind. The most tender scene was when the lone female of the group is on her last legs and one of the men scoops her up in his arms and carries her while she pleads with them to simply leave her behind.The film can be divided into three parts--Gulag, forest & desert trek, and crossing the Himalyas to freedom in India. Unfortunately, the last part of the film feels rushed. Crossing the Himalyas on foot when you're already half starved and recovering from frostbite and other ailments is quite a feat and deserved more attention than was given here. In addition, the actual conclusion or ending is emotionally unsatisfying. We're told nothing about any of the survivors except the main character and even with him it's not much. He goes back to Poland once communism collapses in Europe in 1989--but what did he do after reaching India? Fight with the partisans; go to America? What did the others do? If the 'author' of the book on which this is based didn't know, then say so. At least give us something to take away with us after following these characters on such a long and arduous journey.",7,3,5,31 July 2011
The Town," Undone by weak romance
","This is one of the better heist films of recent years. The cast is strong and look of the film is gritty and realistic. The weakness is the romantic subplot between the team leader (Ben Affleck) and a hostage (Rebecca Hall). Their entire relationship was implausible and they shared little on screen chemistry. Since the 'Townies' are depicted as working-class people sharing intense loyalties and clannish devotion to their Irish code of honor, I would have preferred to spend more time with Affleck and his team, particularly his loose cannon best friend, Jem(Jeremy Renner) and Jem's druggie sister. Their relationships and significant history (Jem's family cared for Affleck's character when he was young and he was romantically involved with Jem's sister) were more interesting to me than anything that occurred between Affleck and Hall. The heist build-up and action were terrific, but since so much emphasis is placed on the romantic storyline, the film isn't as good as it should be. A solid effort with a terrific cast.",6,1,4,19 December 2010
Lion," Emotional Tear-Jerker
","Make sure you bring a box of Kleenex to this one! You will shed heartfelt tears or spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to hold them off. But, while I truly enjoyed the movie, I don't think the movie was structured as well as it could have been. Basically, the first half of the film follows a young Indian boy lost in a strange city and then transitions to Australia 20 years later where the boy was raised by an adopted family. Instead, I would have preferred starting with Dev Patel (the lead character as an adult), seeing him struggle with his identity and gradually show us through multiple flashbacks his experiences as a lost child in India. His growing awakening and recollections about his past would have been a journey both character and audience were making together and would have given the film more heft. Still, this was an uplifting and, at times, bittersweet movie held together by charming leads.",7,2,3,2 January 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Over-Hyped
","The most over-hyped movie of the year. Now, I'm not a comic book fan, nor an MCU fan although I've enjoyed a few, especially 'Spider-Man Homecoming,' which I loved as I'm a sucker for those teenage, coming of age tales. The animation style was lovely in this movie but, the plot was humdrum and there was little character development and none of the witty repartee that is such a hallmark of the best animated films that appeal to both children and adults. This should have focused on Miles Morales getting a disillusioned Peter Parker to train him and get his mojo back. THe other iterations of Spider-Man were unnecessary. This was truly little more than a mediocre kids' animated movie. The small audience in my Friday morning theater was exclusively adult and there was little reaction from the audience throughout. Sitting in the Dolby theater, with the recliner in use, I actually thought about taking a snooze at least a couple of times during the movie.",5,24,70,16 December 2018
Dunkirk," Bland, Boring, Revisionist Take on Dunkirk
","As a WWII buff (listening to 'The Longest Day: Music From The Classic War Films' as I type), I had expected to be first in line when this film came out but I hesitated after reading initial reviews. While extremely positive, many reviews commented on aspects of the film, from the non-linear narrative structure to the choice of characters focused on, that left me feeling that I would not enjoy the movie. I finally broke down and saw it because of its continued box office performance but found it as lackluster as I'd feared.Present-day WWII movies just don't hold a candle to the classics (All Quiet on the Western Front, The Longest Day, Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton, and my all-time favorite film, The Great Escape), nor even big-budget mediocre fare from relatively recent times like A Bridge Too Far or The Battle of Britain. There's way too much pretentious nonsense in modern war movies. Every filmmaker these days has to make a 'statement' about the horrors of war, as if intelligent viewers weren't already aware of that fact. Therefore, instead of a good story with appealing and memorable characters we get one that focuses on 'the coward,' because in the modern-day mindset, anyone who acts in war with dignity and courage and self-sacrifice is seen as unrealistic and somehow a dupe of the evil powers that be. None of those characters was remotely interesting or appealing and the time shifts were totally unnecessary. In addition, the omnipresent music was a total turn-off. There was never any chance to actually hear the real sounds of war, which includes silence and the banter of soldiers trying to make the best of a bad situation. All told, this is the most-overrated movie I've seen in years. Thank God I have the classics on VHS and DVD.",5,147,261,8 August 2017
Batman Begins," O.k. for a comic book movie
","Saw this movie as a non-comic book, non-Batman fan. I thought I'd give it a try. I've seen most of the previous Batman films on DVD and, while I didn't like those either, this one has been the best so far. Bale is nicely cast as the 'hero' and I liked the early part of the film where we see Bruce Wayne train to be Batman and obtain the necessary gear to act out his persona. This first half of the film reminded me of the first Spiderman, which I liked better than the sequel because it also explored the origins of the superhero. But the second half of Batman is boring. The main baddie is Brit character actor Tom Wilkinson, who does a bad impersonation of a Brookly hoodlum. The plot is a bit convoluted and becomes over-saturated with chase scenes and explosions everywhere. (This is the first movie I've seen in a long time where I seriously worry that my hearing may have been damaged.) None of the fighting sequences are staged well; the continuous use of close-ups during the fights made me dizzy. The real pros like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson definitely steel every scene they're in. I guess I generally don't like comic book movies. For me, only Superman 1 and 2 are worth anything.",5,2,7,18 June 2005
Unknown," No, it's not as good as TAKEN
","Despite what some critics say, this is not anywhere near as good as Liam Neeson's action/thriller from last year, TAKEN. This film takes a long time to get going and, unfortunately, when it finally does we don't care all that much because Neeson's character remains essentially an unknown and the plot twist renders him somewhat unsympathetic. In fact, 'the twist' really left me cold. I no longer felt emotionally concerned with Neeson's character beyond wanting him to succeed in order to prevent innocent people from being hurt.Although Neeson is good, Bruno Ganz steals the show as an ex-Stasi (East German secret police) officer turned private investigator who tries to help Neeson's amnesiac character find out why someone's impersonating him. Diana Kruger is OK, too, but it's laughable to believe someone who looks like her (she played Helen of Troy for heaven's sake!) would be a taxi driver in Berlin, even if she were an illegal immigrant. All told, this is a fairly run-of-the-mill action thriller.",6,3,10,18 February 2011
Hidden Figures," Inspiring and Uplifting
","Saw this on Christmas Day at a sold-out theater in Hollywood. This movie was a terrific crowd-pleaser. The audience laughed, shook their heads at times, and clapped when the protagonists stood up for themselves or someone else stood up for them. The main story concerns the small victories that the three leads have working at NASA as black females but its told within the context of the race to get a man in space, which is gripping and genuinely entertaining in its own right. There's humor, a little bit of romance, and feel- good moments that should speak to any person who's ever been overlooked or under-appreciated, especially within a massive organization.I have no idea how much of this is true and what has been padded for dramatic purposes. But, I don't agree with the naysayers who accuse this movie of re-writing history. Of the three leads, one's victory is getting a judge to let her attend a segregated school so she can get the classes she needs to be an engineer; another remains in the clerical pool for the most part but sees the value in learning FORTRAN to avoid redundancy and is finally promoted to supervisor and earns the right to be respected (shown by being addressed as Mrs. Vaughn and not by her first name); the main lead performs calculations that are critical to one aspect of a space flight. The ladies are shown as contributing to a broad, scientific endeavor, which in no way lessens the contributions of other players.",8,23,58,26 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Basic Filmaking Flaws
","Although there were elements within the movie that I enjoyed, particularly those concerning Rey/Ren/Luke, I disliked this movie. The problems for me had nothing to do with how a beloved character was treated or how the force was presented. This movie had basic filmmaking flaws: pacing, plot, structure, character development. I was bored for most of the film, even though I was watching characters that I love. It wasn't until the final act that the pacing picked up as the plot lines merged. I'm genuinely shocked that this was the film that Lucasfilm loved so much that they didn't demand re-shoots or edits and gave the director his own trilogy.",6,0,2,16 December 2017
Ip Man," Good drama, not just martial arts
","I came across this film On Demand. I was intrigued because the film was supposed to be about the mentor/tutor of Bruce Lee and, even though I know next to nothing about martial arts apart from what the average American has seen in mainstream movies, everyone's familiar with Bruce Lee so I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did as the film turned out to be a very fine drama. To me, the martial arts seemed secondary to the more important story concerning the title character's efforts to survive in Japanese-occupied China.Unlike most martial arts films, this one actually had a linear plot, believable dialog, good acting, character development, and realistic fight scenes. Although one of the thugs portrayed in the film comes dangerously close to being buffoonish, for the most part the villains-- the Japanese soldiers-- are realistically drawn as ruthless occupiers, with only one coming across as sadistic. The fight scenes seemed more grounded in reality, without all the flying around on wires or gravity-defying twists and turns. Seeing the proud former Kung Fu masters reduced to sparring (sometimes to the death)in a darkly-lit room against the karate-trained Japanese soldiers for a bag of rice to feed themselves and their families was far more dramatic and emotionally engaging than watching some hero battle a cartoonish villain in a mythical dungeon or fortress.I've never seen Donnie Yen in another film, so I can't compare this performance to others. One other reviewer mentioned that Yen hasn't achieved the status of Jackie Chan and Jet Li because of his looks. I'm not exactly sure how to interpret that, except to say that in my opinion the tall, elegantly handsome Yen has a far more aristocratic bearing than the typical martial arts action superstar. One could imagine him playing the title character in The Last Emperor.But for all its strengths, the film does have weaknesses. Unfortunately, the title character is almost too perfect to believe, and we are not provided enough background information to get some sense of where he came from and what molded him. The ending of the film is also too abrupt. Although I now know that there's a Part II, this film should have gone a little further in depicting Ip Man's transition from wounded man on the run from the Japanese to legendary martial arts master and tutor to such disciples as Bruce Lee. But, overall, a real find.",8,1,2,5 November 2010
La La Land," Love Letter to Hollywood Musicals Misses Hollywood Ending
","I saw this with my 80-something godmother and we both had surprisingly similar reactions. We both agreed that the film gets off to a slow start. It was downright boring in the early scenes, so much so that my godmother admitted she almost fell asleep. The film picks up some much-needed steam when it concentrates on the relationship between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and particularly comes alive whenever jazz takes center stage.I found many of the early scenes a bit pretentious. Mia and her glamorous friends are struggling to make it but they live in a really well-decorated apartment, have fabulous clothes, and get invited to so many pool-parties in the Hollywood Hills that you wonder when she manages to get enough hours at the coffee bar to put food on her table. I also found the film lacking in terms of signing quality. I have excellent hearing but had trouble understanding the lyrics to some of the numbers because everybody seemed to be whispering, which is what unskilled people do when they try to sing. None of the actors could belt out a tune, save for real-life singer John Legend. Finally, I have to say the awful ending was a letdown. Why make a love letter to old Hollywood musicals if you're not going to give us the ending that Hollywood would have given us if this had been made in the 1950s? This plot has been done many times before and much better: girl and guy are fake and phony; girl becomes star and leaves for Hollywood; guy gets left behind; girl secretly pines for her regular guy; guy finally gets up courage to seek her out and they live happily ever after. Would it have been so terrible to have Mia become a success in Hollywood and Seb simultaneously realize his dream of opening a jazz club but have them both realize they were missing something in their lives (like the love of their life) and then meet cute again and go off into the sunset? Only one tune was memorable in this movie, mostly due to its frequent repetition. Otherwise, this was only an OK film.",6,9,18,2 January 2017
Downfall," Interesting, but emotionally flat
","I just saw this on DVD. As a WWII film buff, I found this film interesting from a historical perspective. Certainly the best and most dramatic depiction of the fall of Berlin that I've seen. But as a 'movie,' I found it lacking. There is no central POV; we're introduced to many characters, some of whom we recognize by sight (Goering and Goebbles have become caricatures over time)while others are unknown and their roles are never really explained. A friend is currently reading a book called HITLER'S INNER CIRCLE. Perhaps if I'd read that before seeing the film I may have had a better understanding of who all the personalities were. Rather than focusing solely on the bunker goings-on this film takes us to the streets of greater Berlin where we see generals making futile last stands and encounter roving bands of vigilantes executing anyone trying to flee the chaos and destruction. While these scenes are interesting, they take us away from the central story, which is Hitler and his main underlings' last stand. I felt drained at the end of this film. Nobody to cheer for, nobody to feel sympathy for. The people depicted were the architects of the greatest mass murder and sheer carnage the world has ever seen so they are unable to generate any emotion in the viewer. The only question I had at the end was why couldn't these psychos, murderers, and criminals have committed suicide a decade earlier?",6,6,16,5 August 2005
Wonder Woman," Good First Half Marred by Poor Final Act
","Unfortunately, I came out of the theater underwhelmed as the final act was such a let down compared to the kick-ass 1st act. The 1st act of the film, which mostly takes place on the Amazon's island, was the best part of the entire movie. The backstory of the Amazons was interestingly depicted through Renaissance-type paintings coming to life and the Amazon women were so charismatic , particularly Robin Wright, who steals every scene she's in. The battle between the Amazons and a small invasion force of WWI-era German marines was visually stunning and exciting. The use of slo-mo worked here because of the contrast between the modern weaponry of the sailors and the bows, arrows, and spears used by the Amazons. The wonderful chemistry between the leads carries over into the 2nd act, which takes place in London, where WW is a fish-out-of-water and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor has to show her the ropes. But, this is where things start to go downhill. Instead of the amazing Amazons, WW is saddled with a new posse that fails to make much of an impression save for the character of 'Sameer,' a fez-wearing, flirtatious charmer. The baddies, a German General and a scarred female scientist known as 'Dr. Poison,' are underdeveloped and remain little more than comic-book clichéd characters.The final act is, ultimately, a mishmash of comic book and good vs. evil tropes, elevated by the convincing and winning performances by the two leads. Because I genuinely liked them as individual characters and as a pairing, the lame finale is bearable. It's almost unbelievable that they killed off Robin Wright's character so early in the film. The 3rd act could have been elevated by the appearance of Robin Wright to help WW bring down Ares. If you're going to kill off such a bad-ass character, why not do it in the final act when the stakes are most high. Also, the 3rd Act wasted an opportunity to give us baddies that had some depth. Dr. Poison could have been a more nuanced character whose outward disfigurement mirrored an even more broken soul. The scene where she seemed to be giving in to Steve Tevor's flirtations but once again became embittered when she saw that he was distracted by the arrival of WW, was so promising but, ultimately, the character remained woefully underdeveloped.A terrific cast with undeniable chemistry elevated this movie but it could have been better.",7,1,6,3 June 2017
Casino Royale," Best Bond
","I'm not a huge fan of Bond movies, but I love the James Bond character. What has always turned me off from the movies were the over-the-top villains, unbelievable stunts, and ridiculous gadgets. This Bond movie has excellent action sequences, especially the opening chase sequence which supposedly features the co-creator of 'free running', but they're actually believable (although not necessarily probable). Gone are silly gadgets in favor of old-fashioned guns, torture, poisoned drinks, and repartee between fairly well written characters. It's almost as if, by going back to the first Ian Flemming novel, the producers were set free from having to follow the tired old Bond formula.Daniel Craig is a realistic government secret agent. He's human in that he bleeds, makes bad calls, and has vulnerabilities. Craig's more gritty and realistic Bond allows the writers to give more thought to the characters relationships with others. In previous Bond flicks the agent's relationship with his minders back in London was peripheral at best. Here there are the beginnings of a deeper, more emotional relationship, with M being something of a mother hen to the presumably orphaned Bond.The only weakness in the movie, if it really is one, is that the Bond girl, Eva Green, is NOT stunning and their relationship is tepid. I was shocked when the character produces her business card reading 'Vesper Lynd.' Up to that point I figured the attractive but not stunning woman was a brief walk-on character. Ursulla Andress, Jane Seymore, Maud Adams, even Grace Slick---really stunning and/or unique women who literally could stop traffic. My favorite moment of the film was finding out Vesper was 'bad,' in a way, and Bond had to forget about her and move on! My noon-time audience was fairly large, and the reaction to the movie was very positive. Hopefully, this film will do well and more Bonds with Craig will follow in the same style.",7,0,2,17 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Visually Stunning With Muddled Storyline
","I have seen TFA twice now. Both times I came away very impressed with the visuals. TFA is a gorgeous movie to watch. The practical effects mixed with CGI where necessary created a beautiful and believable backdrop for the movie. The fault with the movie lies in the somewhat muddled story that tries to combine the old with the new and doesn't always succeed.The story is rightly criticized for being a rehash of ANH. Once again, the good guys are out-gunned and out-manned by a tyrannical regime and the savior will be a force-sensitive youth who unwittingly gets caught up in the action. I wish the writers had looked more toward real- world historical events as a guide for writing a story about the aftermath of the downfall of a powerful empire. As history tells us, winning the battle is the easy part; the hard part is winning the peace. When empires fall, there's usually a power vacuum that various entities try to fill: good- intentioned people trying to establish democracy; warlords of various persuasions; dead-enders that refuse to accept the old order's destruction; roving bands of unemployed ex-soldiers with deadly skills that can be put to use by criminal elements, etc. TFA should have been the original trilogy in reverse. By that I mean that the trilogy should have been about a fragile 'New Republic' that after, after 30+ years, is now threatened by a growing movement called the First Order, led by a mysterious agent of the Dark Side and his henchmen, the Knights of Ren. Instead, we see Han Solo, once a respected General and hero of the Rebel Alliance, reduced to being a haggard, down-on-his-luck small-time smuggler; Leia is still leading the rebels and Luke is a hermit hiding from the world and all its problems. I enjoyed the first act of this movie the best as it set up the new characters. The entrance of Han Solo actually slowed the pace and seemed forced and his character didn't really add anything to the overall story. His death should have been the climax of the movie but instead was almost instantly forgotten because the big light saber duel between Kylo, Rey, and Finn ensued immediately afterward and nobody even referred to Solo's death when the battle was successfully concluded.I actually did like Kylo Ren's emo tantrums and I wanna by bad like my grandpa demeanor. Darth Vader was a late-middle aged man when we saw him in the OT; Kylo is still young and petulant. It will be interesting to see how his and Rey's story progresses in future chapters of this saga.",7,2,11,18 December 2015
RED," What were my coworkers thinking!
","Wow. Can't believe my coworkers raved about this film, or that a film with this cast lineup could be so poor. Everything in this film was clichéd and forced. The plot is nonsense and the characters are undeveloped. Amazingly, the stellar cast lacks chemistry, probably because no matter how hard they might try they can't rise above this mediocre script. Only Brian Cox as a retired Russian spy and young CIA hit-man were remotely interesting. Throughout the movie, there's a sense that the director is just trying to get us all to love seeing these actors together on screen, without bothering to provide a script. As someone said, Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, even John Malkovich in a stinker like this I can see. But Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman! Come on, you two are among the very best in the biz! Did you really need this paycheck!",3,4,12,25 November 2010
Munich," Good as a thriller
","This film is a thriller combined with a message film. As the former it succeeds brilliantly; I was riveted during the run-up to and execution of every, well, execution. I loved the details that we were shown and the fact that these events weren't rushed. But I felt the film dragged somewhat whenever it veered into delivering the 'message.' I found the lead assassin's home life uninteresting and too much time was spent following that main character's personal life after he came in from the cold. Throughout the film I kept wanting to know more about how the Israeli government viewed the operations; the end part would have been the time to explore that aspect. Since the film is only 'inspired by real events,' there's no reason the director couldn't have inserted some scenes showing high officials debating the merits of the operation upon its conclusion. Surely there must be some scholarship or rumor about this aspect of the decision to go after the Olympic terrorists. I also felt the prominence of the 'message' seemed to make the lead characters less interesting than the minor ones, such as the elegant Louis and his 'Papa', who are delicious to watch as they have no scruples. A little bit of doubt would creep into anyone's mind who does the kind of job these men did, but too much doubt makes the characters seem weak and indecisive. All throughout the film I enjoyed the characters who seemed to know exactly what they were doing and didn't care what all the consequences were, be they the shadowy information brokers, the Mossad handler (Geoffrey Rush) or the terrorists like Ali. Despite some of these characters only brief appearances, they were the ones I was intrigued by. It's no surprise that of the five assassins I enjoyed Daniel Craig the most, even though I'd see any film with Eric Bana. Overall an excellent thriller weakened by extraneous messages.",7,3,5,21 January 2006
The Nice Guys," Painfully Bad and Boring
","I finally rented this film because of the good reviews that it had gotten. Lots of praise for the chemistry between the leads and it being a throwback to the good ol' buddy cop/PI movies of past. Wow! What a disappointment. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Painfully unfunny, the film's plot is barely discernible and the story is just plain boring. Russell Crowe is still an actor I love (extra pounds and all) and he's the best thing about this movie because he basically plays the straight man and isn't trying to be a clown like Gossling is. I didn't care about anybody in this film. And, I'm tired of Hollywood glamorizing sexually precocious youngsters. Here, the 13 year-old daughter or Gossling's character is made out to be more mature than her idiot father. He's anti-porn and wonders what's happening with young people but the daughter is cool and has frank discussions about sex with porn actresses. Awful movie.",3,23,48,27 August 2016
