Blade Runner 2049," Visually stunning. Emotionally Brilliant.
","Making sequels/reboots of the famous movies can always have a risk factor of its own. Especially if the first movie was a decade ago or much older. Only Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a successful example of such case in the recent times. But it was heavily backed by some good publicity and loyal fan following. Blade Runner 2049 came with huge expectations and it risked it all. Although the first movie had a cult status, it didn't necessarily have a great storyline. But the sequel stands out to be one of the best movies of the 2017 (also a critics' favorite) with hard hitting screenplay and brilliant storytelling.Come 2049, the whole scenario around the replicants and humans have changed again. As the new Blade Runner, K a replicant himself is on a mission hunting down old replicants. However K, has a bit of his own feelings too although he tries to avoid them most times. Things start to take a turn when K digs too much deep into a case on his own and starts discovering some unusual things. As the Replicant making corporation Wallace (yes, its not Tyrell this time) and LAPD try to hunt K and also look for some answers things start getting messy. In his quest for answers, K meets the former Blade Runner Deckard who is living isolated and does not trust anyone. Many answers and some shocking truths reveal themselves as the Wallace corp continues to hunt K and Deckard. It might seem like a regular revenge action plot as K and Deckard meet, but it is much more than that.Running for almost 150 odd minutes this movie is quite lengthy for modern day standards. However there is an absolute attention to detail given to every frame of the movie so as to make it look very intense and beautiful. The movies shows no matter how futuristic the technology can be, the problems that everyone has deep down is very human. The movie resembles the tone of the old Blade Runner initially with the location and cinematography but after a while the movie slowly catches onto a different tone. Ryan Reynolds completely drives this film with his stunning performance as the Replicant/Blade Runner, K. This character is tailor made for someone who doesn't need to express too much but can still convey a lot of emotions. Other top billed actors Harrison Ford, Robin Wright and Jared Leto do justice to their roles. But it's the two different female characters which steal the show along with K. K's holographic girlfriend Joi played by Ana De Armas and Wallace corporation's Assassin/assistant Luv played by Sylvia Hoeks. Both of these characters are very different in their own way and are very well written and exceptionally performed. Hats off to director Denis Villeneuve for creating such an emotionally sound masterpiece.Blade Runner 2049 is a must watch if you are true lover of the cinema as an art and appreciate every little detail of it. It is not just another action sequel of a previous blockbuster, but it is cinema craftsmanship at its best.",9,1,8,20 October 2017
The Equalizer," Washington in Driver's seat
","I love it when old guys do the 'coming out of the hibernation' action movies. So I am going to be partial with this review. After a loud 'Olympus Has Fallen', Fuqua comes out with a bit more subtle action movie this time. It's not complete popcorn stuff. But it's a must watch for Washington's fans. He occupies almost every frame of the movie (no kidding!). The story is pretty simple. But screenplay is well handled. The movie might bore the family audience at times, but not for long. Movie is about how a former CIA (cliché I know) operative takes on Russian gangsters and the whole mob to save a girl whom he meets at a bar. There are some subplots as well to show how our protagonist is a 'Knight in shining armour, except he is living in the world where the knights won't exist anymore'. They add a nice build up to Washington's character and climax.Antonie Fuqua has showed his ability to extract the best from Washington again. Chloe Grace Mortiz has a significant role but she doesn't get much of the screenspace. Marton Csokas gets to play a Russian guy again. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo add strength to the star cast. There might be a sequel to this movie as there are certain hints regarding the way Washigton's character is portrayed in the movie. When Denzel Washington gives a cold stare and says '16 seconds' in that voice, I am not complaining. Are you?",7,1,3,24 October 2014
Iron Man 3," It Only Gets Better
","Marvel has set itself really high standards after The Avengers. So this Ironman had to deliver and it had to be better than its prequels and it does so in style. This is another visual-treat and of course has a strong storyline. This time its more serious, more powerful and there's the crude humor when you are least expecting it.The best part about this movie is that this shows the sensitive side of Tony Stark along with his attitude. You'll connect to him as a common man's superhero too. The action is amazing and we get to see RDJ performing many stunts without the suit too. To get the full satisfaction of this do watch the trailer before you see the movie. That's something you really should do.Robert Downey Jr of course walks away with accolades for his masterful performance. Bring out crude humor and spares no one with his witful sarcasm. Gwyneth Paltrow is hot n great. Guy Pearce does well. Jon Favreau makes an impact in his little role. Ben Kingsley is a class act and Don Cheadle also doesn't disappoint.Its a complete entertainer with rich visual effects and also intelligent with a strong story line. Don't miss this. Don't.",10,6,19,28 April 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A film that draws the dots and connects them
","Last year this time, Star Wars fans rejoiced the rebirth of the Star Wars saga with Star Wars: The Force Awakens and while the sequel for that is under works, Lucasfilms comes with the masterpiece Rogue One which is a Star Wars film of its own kind. It is very hard to say whether Rogue One is a sequel or a prequel. But, Rogue one is a very good addition to the Star Wars saga and it's a treat for the die hard fans who have followed the franchise throughout the years. It is amazing how a single line from the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is made into a film as big and as good as Rogue One. Make no mistakes, the timeline of Rogue One is nowhere close to the recently released Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Rogue one is before the Skywalkers, before the princesses, before the Han Solo's and Chewabaccas. Rogue one is the story of the heroes before the heroes.The script revolves around the events at the time when the Death Star is being built by the Empire. The protagonist Jyn Erso is the daughter of Galen Erso the scientist who is forced to build the Death Star by the Empire's director Orson Kennic. Having escaped from the hands of the Empire as a kid, Jyn Erso grows to be a rebel and a mighty one that is. The Rebellion captures her and sends her to make allies with Saw Gerrera on the moon Jedha (remember anyone?) for getting the message about Death Star which was sent through a pilot who works for the empire Bodhi Rook. The rest of the movie is about how Jyn Erso manages to unite the rebels to steal the schematics of the Death Star which contains the information on how to destroy it which was willfully planted by her father Galen Erso. As the film nears the end Star Wars fans are bound to get Goosebumps to see one of their favorite characters and how everything falls into placeWhile the story doesn't sound much complex, as one goes about watching the movie every bit of their Star Wars memory is tested. The movie makes references to both the old Star Wars and the not so liked millennial Star Wars (Released between 1999-2005). There are many Easter Eggs and references to put the pieces together. Although this is a new movie director Gareth Edwards makes sure not to go over the top and brings us the feel of Episode IV with superbly directed battle sequences. The visual effects are on point which rightly balance the new technology with the feel of the old films. Special mention to the CGI fore recreating the character Grand Moff Tarkin (played originally by the late Peter Cushing) and for another surprise character (I won't tell you who it is). The background score slightly lacks the feel of the original Star Wars at times. But it is understandable considering this is a standalone film.There aren't many top billed actors in the movie, but the chemistry between the leading actors makes up for it. Felicity Jones reminds us how the female lead characters are creating their own space in the present Hollywood. Diego Luna as Cassian Andor is impressive. Ben Mendelsohn as the primary antagonist might not be as terrifying as Darth Vader, but has quite an impacting presence. Alan Tudyk brings the much needed humour at times with his voice-over for the droid K2SO the character which has already created a lot of buzz on the social media. Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen play small but vital roles in this film. The duo of Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang is a treat to watch. Last but not the least, James Earl Jones lends his voice to the character Darth Vader yet again whose role is well written to fit in this movie's premise.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story may not be the magnum opus of the Star Wars, but it perfectly fits into the saga. Rogue one might be a standalone Star Wars film, but it reminds us of all the Star Wars films till date. Make sure you refresh your knowledge of the Star Wars franchise before watching this movie. Rogue One is beautiful, action packed, nostalgic and above all, emotionally captivating.",9,1,7,21 December 2016
Captain Marvel," The First Avenger ;-)
","It had been a while since the last MARVEL movie released (compared to how frequently they come out these days). Captain MARVEL comes right before the most anticipated Avengers: Endgame serving all the right build up with a mix of nostalgia. With a new feminine wave blowing across Hollywood, MARVEL has released the movie right on International Women's day to make sure they check all the boxes.The movie set in intergalactic environment has a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe to it. The story is linked with many previous MARVEL universe movies and characters. The movie would be tough to understand for someone who wouldn't have watched Guardians, Thor and Avengers. The trailer might mislead you to think what the movie might be about. As expected the movies is dominated by female characters. The movie doesn't have the outrageous humour of most other MARVEL movies but there are some light hearted moments, especially involving Agent Fury.
The action sequences doesn't seem very special for a regular superhero movie fan. The editing and the narration however is top notch.Brie Larson steps into the big game with her role as Captain MARVEL. She does fit into that suit both literally and metaphorically. Samuel L Jackson as Agent Fury or should we say agent Nicholas Joseph Fury plays a very important role and the fans get to see a different Fury from what they have seen so far. Clark Gregg's hardly speaking Agent Coulson is still very likeable as it has always been. Annette Benning and Lashana Lynch are apt while I feel Jude Law could have been used better.Captain MARVEL may have hit the screen quite too close to the Avengers Endgame, but it's a fun watch and more importantly watch out for many many Easter eggs especially if you are a fan. The mid credit scene is jawdropping.Ps: Do not miss the MARVEL opening credits scene which is an excellent tribute to Stan Lee.",7,0,2,9 March 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into Awesomeness!
","The Star Trek(2008) was a visual masterpiece. It is a huge task to evolve that film in all aspects. But JJ Abrams scores distinction in all departments.The Movie begins with an excellent opening sequence making you think where was the last film ended. It doesn't take much time for the story to pick up its pace and move on. Slowly you get the hang of the movie and all the characters. Chris Pine is his usual 'I don't care' attitude best. Zachary Quinto is cool with his robotic dialogues. Simon Pegg with his British toned humour makes you laugh in serious situations. I felt that Karl Urban should have had a meatier role. You can't forget Anton Yelchin with his Russian accent. Benedict Cumberbatch has a unique role and his dialogue delivery is amazing.There are so many memorable moments in the movie. Watching in 3D makes you feel that you are also a part of the ship. Some sequences are jaw-dropping. All geeks and non-geeks alike, welcome aboard!",9,3,13,14 May 2013
Deadpool 2," A masterclass of destructive humour
","Savage. That's the least I can come up with to describe Deadpool 2 in one word. This will probably be the coolest movie released this year or for some time now. Sometimes crass, sometimes extremely clever and sometimes emotional, this movie does everything. The self destructive humour this time is up a notch compared to the last one. The comic book, music and other Hollywood references make this movie a treat for a serious movie fan. The humour hits the nail on the head and mocks Hollywood and meny sensitive issues. The promos themselves that lead to this have been brilliantly executed and the movie does one better. This time the movie is not just about Deadpool himself but about the other mutant characters as well. The movie is probably building up to a new generation of XMen. Deadpool fights to save a mutant teenager from Cable who has come from the future. Things get complicated than they are supposed to be and Deadpool fights a moral battle within himself to make the right decisions. The action is indeed brutal thanks to R rating and yet is fun to watch. Old school rock and hip hop music adds to the funky flavour of the movie. What makes this movie special is the way the characters are written. Every character is so unique and almost everyone makes an impact just because how weird the characters are (watch out for a super special guest appearance). Special mention to the dialogue writers of the movie for the insanely clever lines. Ryan Reynolds is just brilliant and it feels like he should be only be playing as Deadpool in whatever the movie he is in. The role of cable suits perfectly for Josh Brolin and with Thanos and this it seems like this is a second coming of his own. All the other support characters do a very good job and special mention to Karan Soni's Dopinder whose role is much more funnier than the first part.Deadpool 2 does everything what you expects it to do and still manages to surprise you. This movie will probably give birth to a new genre in Hollywood something in the lines of parody-satire-action. God bless the coolest crew who made this movie.",10,7,17,18 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor time's a charm
","The MARVEL bandwagon successfully rolls on with the newly released Thor Ragnarok. It goes without saying that there is no shortage of entertainment and some exceptional visuals in this film. This film is the pinnacle of the MARVEL movie (r)evolution. This is a clear representation of what works in the Superhero movies these days. Thor: Ragnarok answers questions that were left unanswered after the previous movie Thor: The Dark World. Thor and Loki still having trust issues have to face their sister Hela, the first born to prevent 'Ragnarok' which is the destruction of Asgard. Hela claims her right to the throne as firstborn and seeks revenge against her father Odin by taking over Asgard and destroying Thor's hammer. Thor and Loki get stranded on the planet Sakaar in the process. After which the movie is about how Thor makes some old and new friends to fight and protect the people of his homeland. A very little of Earth is involved this time around. Most parts of the movie happens in Asgard and Sakaar. It is arguably the most funniest MARVEL movie till date. Although there is not much wit and sarcasm like the previous MARVEL movies, the comic timing in the movie is just about perfect. Beautiful, is the word that I would like to use to describe the action sequences as they seem like a work of art. Special mention to the costume design, hair and makeup department in the movie as they have come with some very innovative styles.This movie has an elaborate cast and the best part is that it makes sure it uses all of them to their potential. Chris Hemsworth has massively improved as an actor and I think the evolution of the Thor character from a straight faced god to a mischievous one has a lot to do with it. Cate Blanchett looks menacing as Hela and she does very well in this not so subtle negative role (which she is generally not used to). Mark Ruffalo is funny as both The Hulk and Dr Bruce Banner. The role of Valkyrie is surely going to give Tessa Thompson a good career boost. Karl Urban and Idris Elba justify their supporting roles. Oh and he director Taika Watiti's role as Korg is really worth a mention. Also, watch out for a special cameo byÂ… a top actor whose name I am not going to reveal ;-)Thor Ragnarok may not be MARVEL's best movie till date, but it surely is a very fun ride.",9,1,10,4 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Homecoming like a breeze
","It was obvious that things were going to be different when MARVEL Studio took the rights of Spiderman from Sony. MARVEL had to step in to save the sinking franchise as it seemed Sony wasn't really sure of what it was doing after The Amazing Spiderman 2. Most were treated to a pleasant surprise in Captain America: Civil War with a much younger version of Spiderman than the earlier films. Spiderman: Homecoming is a refreshing take to match the taste of current MARVEL audiences without compromising the originality of the character.In this movie, there is no dark origin story of the character Peter Parker. He is mentored by Tony Stark and with Stark's help Peter Parker fights neighborhood crimes under the so called 'Stark Internship'. However, things start to take a turn when Peter Parker discovers a gang of criminals lead by the Vulture, utilizing hi-tech weapons which were recovered from the intergalactic battle in the Avengers. He tries to take them on his own, which hampers his relationship with Stark and he loses the internship. The rest of the movie is how Spiderman proves himself to regain the trust of Stark and also stop the Vulture from doing further damage.The 'MARVELisation' of the Spiderman is clearly evident in most of the scenes. Spiderman wears the suit made by Stark Enterprises, which can do things that can blow everyone's minds. Director Jon Watts also makes sure not to disappoint hardcore Spiderman fans by, bringing back the simple old suit in the end. The humour and sarcasm totally reminds us of the recent MARVEL movies which is no surprise. The role of Aunt May has been as glamorous as ever just like other female characters in the recent MARVEL universe. The action sequences are crisp and are really worth a watch in 3D. However the intensity of the film is quite low compared to any other MARVEL films these days, which was slightly disappointing for me. There is one word to describe Tom Holland as Spiderman: Adorable. Marisaa Tomei as a very toned down Aunt May will surely raise eyebrows as she does in the movie itself. Robert Downey Junior might not have much to play as the mentor Stark in the movie, but he is as cool as ever. Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan plays a significant part. Jacob Batalon as Spiderman's best mate Ned manages to tickle some funny bones. Although the negative role Vulture is not so well written, Michael Keaton dominates the part. The movie also has a very diverse casting and is very evident in the characters from Peter Parker's high school played by young actors Tony Revolori, Zendaya and Laura Harrier.Spiderman: Homecoming is a pleasant 'homecoming' for MARVEL's spidy. It will be very interesting to see how MARVEL takes his character forward to the next Avengers' movies as the rights for the Spiderman sequel is back with Sony again.",8,15,25,11 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," This moment. We Own It.
","At first when I heard the song 'We Own It(Wiz Khalifa ft. 2 Chainz)' playing at the starting credits of the movie which is a collage of first 5 films, I said to myself, 'I have got my money's worth'. Fast and Furious 6 brings out an ensemble cast along with amazing action.In this movie, Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) seeks the help of Torreto(Diesel) to catch a criminal named Shaw(Evans) by offering him to reunite him with Letty(Rodriguez) who was presumed dead. Then on its the story how Torreto assesmbles the team and takes on Shaw, along with trying his best efforts to get back Letty. The story doesn't have much to it, but its the action sequences with some nest jaw dropping moments in recent times along with one-liners, keeps you entertained. There are few over the top sequences, but Fast and Furious fans are not gonna mind that.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, essay their roles with ease. In this part we see a lot of action from Dwayne Johnson and trust me its good. Gina Carano's fights are cool. But its Tyrese Gibson with his funny and loud-mouthed Roman Pearce who wins your hearts and a special mention to Ludicrous who has some witty dialogues.Director Justin Lin shows how genius he is at the end when he connects some missing links. Overalll Fast and Furious 6 is another super 'add-on' to one of the enthralling movie franchisees. Go and sit in the Driver's seat!",9,2,4,29 May 2013
Suicide Squad," Why So Serious?
","I can't seem to quite get the hate that is going on for the DC films this summer. First Dawn of Justice and now this. Both have been slammed by critics and fans alike. In fact I found both of them pretty good. Although Suicide Squad is very different from Dawn of Justice in terms of its approach to the Justice League build up. The problem with Suicide Squad is the time and screenspace. With so many characters and so little time the movie starts off as if from the middle. The characters are introduced in a hurry and they are sent on a mission unprepared (just like the script). The concept of 'preparing for the war' is used as a reason yet again as it was in Dawn of Justice. There isn't much to say anything about the story as it is very little. It is better to go on about each and every characters which makes more sense.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller: Has a powerful role. But mostly unclear about what her purpose is. Many questions remain on her actions by the end of this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn: Undoubtedly the showstealer but most of you would know it anyway. But lack of clarity at times makes her role a bit confusing. Joel Kinnaman as Colonel Rick Flag: Apt and brilliant. Cara Delevingne: An important role as Enchantress for this young model, although she gives her best the role is not so well written. Jai Courntey and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Booomerang and Killer Croc respectively: Mainly cast to up the humor part and they do well. Jay Hernandez as Diablo: Surprisingly good. One of the best characters of the movie, hardly has any line but makes maximum impact. Scott Eastwood as Lieutenant GQ Edwards: Wasted as a sidekick to colonel Rick Flag. Unable to see much of his acting abilities. Jared Leto as The Joker: Amazing. Unfortunately we hardly see much of him in this part. Hoping to see more in the Batman or next Suicide Squad. and last but not the least Will Smith as Deadshot: Will Smith gets everything right from Humor to making sense in this chaotic of a film. I was worried that he might get lost in the flurry of other characters, but the script has given him much importance and he does fit in well.I haven't read any comic books so I am not sure if this will disappoint comic book fans but this Suicide Squad is definitely a different DC movie in the recent years. Subtle is the last world you should be looking for if you want to say something about this movie. Watch Suicide Squad for all the fun and antics.",8,0,3,16 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Blown Away
","Well you probably don't need a review to go watch a MARVEL movie these days. They are just shifting gears of awesomeness. I am writing one just for my satisfaction.Captain America The Winter Soldier is another shift in this Avenger's gear but with full throttle. This film is much more grittier than the 1st one yet manages to deliver the Marvel brand humor too. The story is about Captain America taking on the hostile organization inside S.H.I.E.L.D who has the Winter Soldier at their disposal. This movie has non stop action, probably the most in The Avenger's franchise, yet it never bores you or tires you. Chris Evans cakewalks through his role. Antony Mackie has done really well too. This time we see a different Nick Fury in this film with Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johannsen as black widow delivers a compelling performance. Special mention to Sebastian Stan for the cold faced Winter Soldier. Do wait and watch the post credit scenes as they leave us wanting for more.I don't have to specifically tell everyone to watch this movie. I know you will be. But do watch as soon as I can and enjoy this one hell of a ride!",9,6,12,4 April 2014
Doctor Strange," A visual MARVEL
","Whenever I write reviews on MARVEL films, I am usually singing praises and Doctor Strange is no strange to this;-) Doctor Strange is the purest example of film with visual effects on point. It is thoroughly entertaining, engaging and overall visually stunning MARVEL masterpiece. It is not your usual MARVEL universe flick but although it might evolve to be one in the future. But this is great more as an independent film. Doctor strange is intelligent, humorous, fast paced and of course I am never tired of mentioning this again and again: visually brilliant.The story is about the self obsessed genius and rich doctor who meets a fatal accident. Ironically the nerves on his hands don't work the way they used to (I am not sure about the medical terms for this). Hell bent on finding the cure he embarks on a journey to Nepal to find cure via mystic arts which he doesn't believe in. And then the movie suddenly shifts to amazing mode. The supernatural elements kick in with unbelievable visual effects. Then the movie is about how Doctor Strange becomes someone more than he is, learns things that is beyond our mere imagination and helps his guru (The Ancient one) to fight off evil powers who are about to take over the world. The story line may seem quite the usual stuff, but it's the representation that makes this film extraordinary. I personally haven't read the comic books but I am quite sure this film exceeds even the comic book readers' imagination. Action sequences take you to different worlds, time dimensions and whatever you just cannot think of. The MARVEL brand of humour is as usual a success. Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't have asked for a better role to be as a MARVEL superhero. Doctor Strange is almost an alter ego of his TV role Sherlock. Tilda Swinton as 'The Ancient One' is pure gold. Her performance makes this film much intense. Chiwetel Ejiofor is one of my favorite actors and he is brilliant as well. Scott Adkins could have been used for much intense action sequences and I also feel the film doesn't do much justice to Mads Mikkelsen's acting talent. Rachel McAdams plays the typical antagonist's love interest or friend whatever who is just there to stay amused like the rest of us. Benedict Wong as Wong has a very funny and engaging role.Doctor Strange is probably the best visual effects movie that I have ever seen. Try not to think much of the visual effects but just watch and enjoy. And please please do see it in IMAX if you have access to an IMAX cinema.",9,1,3,12 November 2016
Interstellar," A 166 minute journey that takes you through years
","After completing an epic superhero saga (The Dark Knight trilogy), Nolan comes back to test your brains as he has done several times in the past. Interstellar is more than just a film. It's a journey. It's a journey in which you travel and experiment through different dimensions of space along with the lead characters (please watch it in IMAX). It is evident that one would compare this with Gravity, but apart from some special effects, nothing is similar to Gravity. It's a complete new way of storytelling through space travel. The movie has all the elements. Visual effects are the best part. I know it's a common thing in recent big budget movies and everyone does it well. But Interstellar not only gets it right but also unique. You will experience a unique space travel compared to other movies. And also you need to think hard while watching this movie as listening to most of the dialogues is like sitting in an astro- physics class. But you cannot complain when the visuals are so engrossing. Even though if it's tough to understand sometimes, the visual effects makes your ticket price worth. I am also overwhelmed by the fact that the movie is in 2D, as it shows how well you can make a movie with the same visual effects without having the 3D. I hope this movie gets the Hollywood back to its golden 2D age.Ten years ago, you could have never expected Mathew McConaughey to pull of a role like this. The way he shifts from one emotion to another is just spell bounding. Anne hathway does justice to her role, though she looks a little pale. Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine have some important roles as well. The movie doesn't depend much on its supporting characters, but Nolan extracts the best out of everyone.I expected a brainer from Nolan and Interstellar is one. But its not how you think it will be. This goes to some levels that even your imaginations can't reach.",10,1,6,7 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," End of a saga spread across generations
","I think people who have watched the Star Wars franchise have seen it all. The evolution of film making and storytelling in the last few decades. The first and the last movies are 4 decades apart and I wonder how the people who actually watched the initial movies in theaters right now. Having caught up to Star Wars saga only in the last decade or so, I feel indifferent now that it is coming to an end. May be it's me or may be these last 3 movies become cult classics 3 decades from now.Star Wars came back with such a big bang in 'The Force Awakens'. There was a refreshing element to it and the Rogue One a related movie added to the hype. However, this saga started losing its way with 'The Last Jedi' and the previous related movie Solo was a dud as well. The Last Jedi had already made the plot way too complicated that it should have been and also adding and removing different characters in between. Having watched that I didn't really have much expectations for The Rise of Skywalker and it was how I expected it to be. A lot of nostalgia, focus around a single character and some fun thrown in between. However this movie is not as tiring a watch as The Last Jedi. There are some goosebumps moments, however I believe they missed out on a lot of others.Daisy Ridley seems tired on the screen and on the role. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac have a decent chemistry, however it's not as energetic as it was in The Force Awakens. Kudos to the special effects team for managing to make the late Carrie Fischer appear at ease as Princess Leia. Ian McDiarmid could probably keep playing Palpatine forever. However, the droids in this movie are the ones which keep audience hooked. C-3P-, R2-D2, BB-8 and D-0 keep us company in the galactic journey by adding the fun elements. Having heard Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, I feel he speaks with the same deep voice in all the movies he is in these days:)My rating of 8 is mainly because how I relate to this classic saga. The Rise of Skywalker is a decent watch for the fans, but makes us look back and wonder if the last 3 movies were really needed at all.",8,2,8,20 December 2019
Southpaw," Fuqua wins by knockout. Again.
","So, its the third in a row and Fuqua maintains his pace and narration yet again. We all know Fuqua hardly makes movie for the critics he does it for the audience. But what makes Southpaw stand out is that it is in its limits. The sequences are not too dramatic though they are predictable. The plot is nothing more than what the trailer shows. But its always good to keep expectations low and deliver high and this film does exactly that. There have been so many boxing movies already and its a challenge for director to keep the audience engaged. Though a little slow at start, the movie picks up its pace with the character of Forest Whitaker. There are some really interesting conversation between Jake Gyllenhal and Forest Whitaker. The boxing sequences are well shot but its Eminem's Phenomenal track and other background score which gives the audience goosebumps and amps up the experience of this film.Jake Gyllenhaal is classic as troubled boxer Billy Hope. Rachel McAdams has a blink and a miss role and she looks beautiful while she is there. Forest Whitaker and Oona Laurence does justice to their characters. The other supporting characters doesn't have much to do in the movie. Yet again Fuqua proves one can make an engaging film without a strong script. Phenomenal.",8,4,8,24 July 2015
Ant-Man," Perfect break for Paul Rudd
","When Paul Rudd was announced as Antman, I double checked if I was reading it right. With no disrespect to Paul, I never considered him to fit in a big franchise as a leading man. But well, Marvel makes wonders. Instead of bringing a new face for Antman, Peyton Reed brings out a Paul Rudd that we have never seen before. Though the movie is quite independent, there are some connections to The Avengers franchise as well. So you might miss few things if you haven't seen The Avengers or any of other Marvel Universe movies. Though the script has nothing much to offer, apart from the experiments gone wrong, conflict of evil and good scientists, broke leading character etc, it is the CGI and the camera effects make this movie special. As everyone knows the concept of Antman is very heavily dependent on size and hence the makers have to be very careful about switching the camera angles and the CGI and they have got it just right. As always the tongue in cheek humor of Marvel franchise, is continued here as well. Michael Pena has you in splits. Though Michael Douglas' role is stereotypical, it is adjustable. Evangeline Lilly and Corey Stoll are apt, but it is Paul Rudd who drives this vehicle smoothly. He doesn't try too hard. You almost feel like Paul Rudd has done many roles like this.Be sure not to miss the Post Credit scenes. I know Marvel fans are not going to miss this movie. If you are not following the Marvel Universe yet, as Nick Fury says 'Its about damn time'.",9,1,8,17 July 2015
Baby Driver," Groovy Babyy
","Director Edgar Wright is in a league of his own. I have always been a fan of his movies, especially the three flavors cornetto trilogy. With Baby Driver, Wright adds one more feather to his cap by directing this heist action comedy. Oh wait, it can also be categorized musical. Baby Driver is about a young driver named Baby who works for a criminal boss to help him and his team finish a job. Things take a sharp turn, when Baby finds the love of his life and decides to quit what he is doing. Things are not as easy as they seem, as he has to go against his evil boss, weird heist crew and the law. Of course, Baby Driver has car chase sequences and are superbly shot. But what makes the action better is the music paired along with that. Music Director Steven Price has put out some classics which play mainly as a part of Baby's iPod playlist. The gunfights and combat sequences are quite similar to the ones from previous Edgar Wright movies and it is total fun. This film is completely character driven. Each character is unique in its own way just like their names. Ansel Elgort as Baby has delivered his best without even having to say many dialogues. The current young generation can relate to his character so much as someone who just want to plug earphones and forget the rest of the world. Jon Hamm as buddy looks very stylish. Kevin Spacey as doc cakewalks through his cool antagonist role. Jamie Foxx is definitely a standout with his impromptu and crazy character called Bats.Baby driver is a clear example of how one can make a good movie with just well written characters and wicked film making. This will definitely go down as a classic in years to come.",9,2,7,16 July 2017
Justice League," It's never a bad time for some Justice!
","The critics' dark cloud has doomed over a DC movie yet again. Although this might not have affected the box office collections of the Justice league much, it made sure that this movie didn't break any records. I am writing this review after having read most of the reviews and quite few many days into the release date. Just like Batman V Superman, I liked Justice League and in fact I loved it.After the stupendous success of Wonder Woman in July, there was quite a decent platform set for the release of the Justice League. The Batman v Superman movie set the foundation for the collaboration of heroes and Justice League brings the concept of heroes teaming up (or should we say forming a league), to save the world. Batman leads and brings new recruits into the team in his own style with the help of Wonderwoman. And by now most of you would have already known how Superman gets involved. This movie is has a very tight running time and it wastes no time in setting its agenda straight. The villain is introduced at the beginning followed by the new heroes and then they all involve in an epic battle. The visual effects have a slightly different tone from a regular superhero film, but I am not complaining. The scenes involving flash are a treat to watch. The film has many moments of good humour and sarcasm compared to previous Snyder's movies (did it have something to do with the fact that Joss Whedon partly directed the movie?). The short duration of the movie left me wanting for more.The movie does lack a strong or rather well defined role of the antagonist. Comic book fans can probably give a better review of the SteppenWolf character voiced by Ciaran Hinds. Portraying an aging and least dominating Batman suits Ben Affleck like fish to water. Although Jason Momoa doesn't have much to speak as Aquaman, he surely ups the humour level of the film which is already set at a higher bar by Barry Allen aka Flash played by Ezra Miller. Ray Fisher has a decent debut as Cyborg, but the role doesn't test much of his acting skills. Gal Gadot is classy as always with her portrayal of Wonderwoman. Other top billed actors like Amy Adams, Diane Lane, J.K Simmons and Amber Heard doesn't have much to do. However, they would probably be playing vital roles in upcoming individual Batman and Aquaman movies.At some point one might feel like DC may have tried to play catch up with MARVEL in a hurry as far as building a cinematic universe is concerned. I would have loved to see separate movies for all of these characters before the Justice League which would have given this a very good build up. This doesn't affect the fact that Justice League is still one of the best action movies of 2017 and is a very good watch.",8,0,0,11 December 2017
Bridge of Spies," A Well Balanced Thriller
","There are two sides two Steven Spielberg. One- Making magnanimous movies with big budget and special effects, Two- Making history come to life with classic film-making. Bridge of spies belongs to the second type. Based on true events, Bridge of Spies tells the story of American Lawyer, Jim Donovan in two parts. The first part is where he tries to do his best as a defense lawyer for the alleged Russian spy Abel and the second part where he negotiates a prisoner exchange with Russians and Germans. The film has two different flows. But, one cannot argue over the shift in the storyline as it is based on real events and it is best that Steven Spielberg has kept it that way. Very well written dialogues, subtle humour and great acting makes this movie, a masterpiece. Not too emotional, not too funny, not too dramatic this movie balances everything well.Tom Hanks, well there is nothing to say about him we all know he gives the best. But Rylance, with very few lines is the one who steals the show in this film. His role adds a whole new dimension to a grey character. Apart from these two characters, other roles are hardly significant. If you are looking for an out and out entertainment, this movies pace might disappoint you. But this movie is for the good cinema lovers. Who loves and admires a work of art whenever they see one.",9,2,5,28 November 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Formula'd for perfection
","You want action in the air? You got it. On land? You got it. Underwater? You got it. When it comes to the Mission Impossible series the title itself gives away that it's a no-brainer and you would be a fool only if you try to make more sense of it. After a not so entertaining Jack Reacher, Christopher McQuarrie more than makes up for it with the 5th film of the MI franchise. This film picks up from where Ghost Protocol left and in fact it even almost carries the same theme of the IMF being disowned. Like Ghost Protocol, the story travels between countries and beautiful locations as well. This time Tom Cruise is working alone as Ethan Hunt trying to save the IMF from an attack by another high skilled rogue organization called 'The Syndicate' where he is later joined by Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn. Tom Cruise once again does jaw-dropping unreal stunts but with the way they have been shot one wouldn't mind watching it again and again. There is everything in this movie that a typical Mission Impossoble movie would have, an outrageous stunt, the ridiculous mas, a very good chase sequence (this time with bikes and more scenic), different countries, that last minute finishing stunt sequence which you know has a happy ending but still keeps you on your toes, the wry humour, the formulaic accusation on the lead character and him being hunted by the government and the list goes on... So what's the difference? There is no difference. The movie sticks to its old school ways and with extra humour and epic shot action sequences can almost manage a 'nothing' story. The MI franchise has become such a cult that it is hard to ignore unless it makes something way too awkward.You can see stretch marks on Tom Cruise with his aging, but hey, that hardly takes away his energy. He is good as ever with the role of Ethan Hunt and still manages to keep everyone entertained with his expressions. Simon Pegg has a meatier role in this movie and through his role one can see the importance given to comedy as per the recent Hollywood trend. Simon Pegg has almost equal screen-space as Tom Cruise. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames are fun but don't have much to do as the Tom Cruise-Simon Pegg chemistry is unbeatable. Simon McBurney and Alec Baldwin fit in their typical 'boss' roles. However I found that Rebecca Ferguson's role as Ilsa could have been well written though she tries hard looking sexy. Sean Harris as Lane- the prime antagonist has a very impressive villainous voice. This was one of the few movies in the recent times where I didn't even look at my watch for a second. It was very hard to take my eyes off from the movie. Yes I know its a very cheesy no-brainer formulaic movie. But everyone has a cheat meal in their diet don't they? Go indulge in one. Do watch it in IMAX!!",9,4,8,30 July 2015
Dunkirk," Nolan Dictates. Zimmer Orchestrates.
","When Christopher Nolan makes movies, the bars are always set high. Dunkirk might have a simple plot about survival, but its about how Nolan delivers rather than what he delivers. Dunkirk is based on the rescue of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and other allied soldiers from the French seaport of Dunkirk during the World War 2. However the characters in the movie are not directly correlated to any of the survivors.Dunkirk could easily pass off as another world war based movie and join the ranks. But what makes Dunkirk standout is a simple story with no subplots (however Nolan has made sure to test our intelligence yet again with the screenplay) with some outstanding cinematography with a breath taking background music score by maestro, Zimmer. Watching Dunkirk in IMAX will almost make you feel like one was in Dunkirk experiencing the horror. The lead characters in the movie barely speak and Nolan lets the situation and surroundings does the talking. The movie looks like it focuses on the lead character played by the newbie Fionn Whitehead but, as the movie goes on other characters become fairly important. There are many main characters in the movie, but Tom Hardy with barely any face expression to portray makes a big impact yet again. Veterans Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh have quite interesting roles. Harry Style's acting debut doesn't showcase much of his acting talent but he has done his job.Dunkirk is a very intense and emotional movie. Its almost like a War Musical with Hans Zimmer's brilliant music and sound effects. Watch Dunkirk movie for the cinematic brilliance that is and not for the weekend entertainment.",9,5,15,26 July 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Take your brains along. Not popcorn!
","I have always loved the X men franchise. Its always fascinating to see more than 1 super powers in a film. After the 'X men- Last Stand', the franchisee focused on prequels and sequels(The Wolverine) to connect to this big movie. Bryan Singer back in the director chair gets almost everything right to bring this magnum opus to the big screen.As the title suggests this film's set in the future, which takes us to the past. In the future, both the human and the mutant species are on the brink of extinction due to a war against very powerful weapons sent on mutants to wipe them off the planet. However Charles Xavier and Magneto find a way to prevent that from happening by sending Wolverine into the past to change those events which lead to this war which mainly focuses on the character Mystique. This time Wolverine also has the challenge to convince the unstable Xavier and Magneto of the past and get their help in doing it. The rest is how it is accomplished and what does it change with respect to the present/future. Yes, its complicated. But its fun and we might have all the answers in the coming Xmen movies.Though the movie focuses on Hugh Jackman as a lead character, its a different wolverine we see. Not the irresponsible, easygoing but the mentoring. Hugh Jackman with his beast of a body impresses yet again. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has a meatier role this time and considering the success she's having these days nothing can go wrong for her. James McAvoy, Fassbender, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen give life to their Magneto and Xavier characters in both the timelines. Evan Peters as Quicksilver is an interesting addition.Since its Xmen there are so many characters and its difficult mentioning each one of them.But I personally felt, Peter Dinklage's acting talent was bit underutilized in his role as Dr.Bolivar Trask. There are some extraordinary action sequences like Quicksilver's ultra speed motion fight, Mystique changing her form on course of the fight and of course some Magneto's powerful scenes.There are hardly any disappointing moments in the movie and you'll come out of the cinema hall with some answers and a lot of questions.Bryan Singer keeps us on our toes and makes us ready and curious for the next movie.",9,1,1,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Little things that matter
","So, its almost summer and its MARVEL time! Who doesn't look forward to MARVEL movies these days? They have been delivering quite well in the recent past and they continue to do so with the new Captain America (or should I say Avengers?) movie: CIVIL WAR. One would have seen the trailer and promos and would clearly have gotten the point about the movie's plot. It is war. A war between two of the biggest Avengers, two of the best friends and two contrast personalities. So the movie wastes no time in creating the rift between Tony and Steve Rogers to initiate the 'war' and the remaining avengers split up conveniently in teams wit their differences of opinions on the matter of Avengers killing innocent civilians in their quest for peace. As a matter of fact one would have seen this coming, with hints about minimizing the collateral damage in Avengers, Age of Ultron. So superhero fans, bombing and crashing buildings, throwing cars are not just to boost the action sequences anymore.Although one can argue that the story is a bit out of focus at times while trying to focus only on the rift, the directors produce something brilliant or give out a little hint twist just at the right time. That's why its the little things that matter that lifts Civil War when its down and takes it to another level. If you though the Winter Soldier played his part in Captain America The Winter Soldier think again. Because, this is more of a Winter Soldier movie than the previous one. The film slightly tries too hard to introduce all the new characters and reintroduce old characters but doesn't take anything away in the way it has balanced it all. Chris Evans for me is Captain America all the way. He is so good every time he dons that costume and leads the way. You just can't seem to disagree with whatever the Cap says. Robert Downey Jr has a slightly darker IronMan role this time. Chadwick Boseman is impressive, Paul Rudd is once again exceptionally funny and Paul Bettany as vision is just too cool. Of course cudos to all the other actors portraying avengers as well. It has been a unique and Avenger-esque introduction for Tom Holland as spiderman and I hope MARVEL keeps the same tempo going. Daniel Bruhl is an exceptional actor and he has delivered nothing less in his role as Zemo. It was slightly disappointing to see Martin Freeman's talent waste in a role with the suit. You cannot compare Dawn of Justice and Civil War. Both are movies of completely different tempos. I personally liked both and what makes Civil War click specially, is those little things, those moments that you will only understand if you watch the movie.",9,7,13,7 May 2016
Avengers: Endgame," I am not crying, you are
","Wow.
Phew.It is hard to put in words the emotions I went through after watching this epic.
The 10 years journey with this cinematic universe comes to an end and how. Avengers: Endgame is that final piece of the puzzle which MARVEL puts it out in style. The movie is a treat in every possible way for the loyal fans and also for the 'hype' crowd. The action, the humour, emotions and the characterization are blended in so well. The story is an epic journey with some great nostalgic elements thrown in. The fans who have followed the universe are going to relate and love every bit of it.This movie does not need a review, it does not need a brief overview. Even if I try, I cannot possibly write about the characters and how good everyone were. This is a movie to be experienced in the cinemas. So go out there watch this movie of a lifetime.And as Thanos says 'Now I rest'.PS: Please be good and don't spoil this for others.",10,1,6,26 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," The hype is real
","The biggest (in all sense) and definitely the most darkest movie of the Marvel Universe has finally arrived and it has arrived in style just like its antagonist Thanos. Avengers: Infinity War is an ensemble of characters at the highest level. It is a treat for ardent Marvel fans and to the other movie fans it's kind of an emotional jolt. Unlike most other movies which centers around its protagonists, Infinity War is very much about its antagonist Thanos. The whole movie is an answer to all the bits of Easter eggs that we saw in other Marvel movies until now. Thanos goes around the universe gathering infinity stones to fulfil of his purpose of bringing a 'balance' to the universe while the split up Avengers get back together to stop him. While we get answer to many questions, some other questions start forming in our head. This time the superpowers are much more advanced, the space travel is simpler and quicker. It is very hard connect the dots and analyse them as the movie has an unstoppable and intense screenplay. The humour although much lesser compared to its predecessors, still delivers quality. There are many goosebump worthy moments which in themselves are worth of the ticket price. The only downside for me was watching this in IMAX 3D which didn't make much of a difference at all. It is very hard to write about individual characters and performances in a movie as big as this. However the mega villain Thanos lives upto the hype of the character. It is also interesting to see the emotional and confused side of the character as well. Josh Brolin with his deep voice suits in every bit. I am a bit skeptical about how other characters get to know each other in a quick team and form a team. It is both entertaining and emotional at the same time to see them together in the big screen. Avengers: Infinity War is absolutely the biggest Marvel Movie so far and it is anything but over.",9,1,3,7 May 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," An Apocalypse, that is a new beginning.
","We all know that the X-Men franchise revival started with X Men First Class. It followed by a not so great The Wolverine (I liked it though!) and then the most complicated, X-Men Days of Future Past set the tone. Bryan Singer has worked hard again to make the people forget the debacles of X2 and XMen-The Last Stand, it is totally evident when in this movie, some characters after watching the 'Return of the Jedi', come out saying at least we can agree the third ones are always the worst :-) But the film raises many questions and also it is completely up to the individuals whether they will like the movie. There are many reasons why X-Men would have evolved the way it has now. The veteran actors' age and their commitments to the long-term projects are the primary ones. Although the way the franchise is moving now is somewhat questionable. We have the introduction of all the characters once again and now there is a lot more grey area. Of course even the movie making has evolved in the years and the hero- villain concept is simple like it is used to be. Although X-Men Apocalypse directs its focus on one main evil character, Apocalypse the story around the rest of the characters evolve around them choosing between good and evil. With this film, we are back to the Xavier academy, with more advanced learning facilities and a sponsored and designer Ray Ban eye gear for Scott Summers which is a clear indication of the new age film making. The visuals are a treat to watch, especially the ones from the past Egyptian Era. Action is great as usual and there are some fun moments added here and there to live up to the MARVEL brand. Yes the villain's ideology is very stale 'building a new world' and what not, but isn't that what every apocalyptic movies are about?The roles of both Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy get eventually sidelined by the fascinating characterisation and performance of Oscar Isaac's apocalypse. I loved the costume design and make up for him although I thought there should have been more clarity around his mutant powers. I can't say much about the new young actors except Evan Peters and Sophie Turner who have quite more to offer as Quicksilver and Jean Grey. Our dear Sansa Stark looks more and more beautiful grown up. Having occupied more screenspace both in XMen first Class and Days of Future Past, Jennifer Lawrence may have slightly a lesser role to play here. I loved Michael Fassbender as magneto and he is no less in this film also. I am slightly critical about the characterization of Charles Xavier here as it falls somewhere between powerful and helpless. Olivia Munn is in for the glam quotient and boy she is hot! I found X-Men Days of Future Past to be slightly complicated because it wanted to reverse everything just in a span of single movie and it was hectic. Although I eventually read about it and understood it better. X-Men apocalypse is much more simpler and entertaining to watch. But somewhere at the corner of your mind there can be a psychic voice saying, 'It may have been better'.",8,6,13,23 May 2016
1917," Masterclass
","I am probably not qualified enough to write a review about this classic. Especially considering almost how all the making videos surfacing on the internet have already described the brilliance of the movie.Most of the war movies happen to be critic favourites and also go on to win awards. 1917 has been topping many charts along the same line. But what makes 1917 stand out is not just it's script and making but it's attention to detail which is a treat if you are a movie observer. As most of you already know the movie is shot in the same sequence as the script. The movie's journey through its lead characters makes the audience also experience the same with the one shot technique. Great acting from the young actors, special appearances, epic background music and the special camerawork add to this wonderful cinematic experience. Despite being a war drama, the movie can cater to almost all age groups.1917 is a cinematic experience like never before and puts 3D movies to shame with its unique filmmaking.",10,0,4,1 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force is our religion and Jedi is our god
","Star Wars franchise has gone through different phases over the last 30 odd years. There were ups and then there were downs. But since the release of 'The Force Awakens', it has resurrected itself in a quite a grand manner. The recent addition: The Last Jedi perfectly blends the madness of Star Wars with a gritty storytelling. We all kind of had a hunch that 'The Force Awakens' was like a foundation for much bigger things to come. The Last Jedi takes the franchise forward in the right direction.As the name suggests, the story of the movie focuses on the concept of Jedi. While Rey is looking to find the answers from Luke Skywalker, Kylo Ren is fighting is own inner self. The Resistance as always is on the run from First Order. Both these plots run parallelly until they connect in the end. Like every other Star Wars film, we get to see new worlds and another set of unique characters. Although this isn't as humorous as The Force Awakens, there are some moments to tickle your funny bone. The movie is very vivid in terms of visual effects and there are some jaw dropping scenes. The action sequences at times makes one exclaim out of pure joy. Director Rian Johnson has made sure to blend the classic Star Wars drama with his style of filmmaking perfectly well.Almost all the characters have in depth roles this time starting with Luke Skywalker. The good ol' Jedi is back but he is not his original self. Although Luke Skywalker isn't as charming as he used to be, he has his own cool moments in the movie. Daisy Ridley has a meaty role yet again and most of the film revolves around her. The character Kylo Ren is well written this time and Adam Driver pulls it off brilliantly. Though Oscar Isaac and John Boyega play second fiddle to the lead characters, their roles are thoroughly entertaining. It is very emotional to see the beloved princess Carrier Fischer as Princess Leia for the one last time. Laura Dern has a very key role as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux brings a very retro feel to the movie. And as usual there are many other small but key supporting characters as a part of the resistance.Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an intense and emotional ride. It has all the classic ingredients of a Star Wars movie, but it also shows that the franchise is surely upping its game.",9,1,5,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," We believe in MARVEL
","We all had a pretty good idea on what this movies was going to deliver we had seen its trailer. The only question was how? Also there was a question if they are risking too much by suddenly introducing an all new MARVEL film, amidst of The Avengers franchise that was going on well. We also had our doubts if they are making things too complicated by connecting it to The Avengers in the future. Well, Guardians of the Galaxy manages to stick to your seats and keep faith in Marvel. Again.As the name suggests, this story is all about Galaxy and so many planets that you find it difficult to remember (Earth reference coming very rarely). As seen in the earlier reference of Thor the Dark World post credit scene, this movie is about one of those collectible objects(The Orb) that the collector is collecting. The fight for this leads to the meeting of Gamora (Saldana) and Peter Quill (Pratt) whom are joined by the bounty hunters Rocket (Bradley Cooper voicing one of the hilarious character of 2014) and Groot (Diesel). Then the story becomes more complicated with more people (or should I say Aliens?) wanting The Orb and their evil intentions. Drax The Destroyer (Bautista) joins the party and the all time quarrelling enemies become friends and call themselves of Guardians of the Galaxy. About the story I don't have to reveal many details here because there are so many other aspects in the movie which not only keep you on your toes but also has you in splits. A movie which is mostly dependent on CGI and green screen as there is hardly any part shot on earth has a tough ask on its hands to balance its main plot and also not confuse the audience with too many characters and planets/galaxies or any similar objects like that. At the beginning I thought things were getting a bit out of hand, but James Gunn manages to keep the humor afloat so that you don't complicate things too much. The characters are really well written and I think this movies going to be career changing feat for most of the actors. Chris Pratt looks like everyman's hero by playing quirky character as Peter Quill. Zoe Saldana is as sexier in green as she was in blue (Avatar). Though the Bradley Cooper's voice as Rocket is bit digitally modified it's one of the most intimidating character that you will ever see and more than half of the humor in the film is this character's contribution. Also, I salute the CGI team for bringing so many emotions into the Rocket character. You feel it's almost next to you. Vin Diesel as Groot doesn't have much to speak but the character is written very well. The surprise for me was Dave Bautista as Drax, I didn't expect much from him due to his WWE background, but he has performed equally well in both comic and emotional scenes. I expected more form Benicio Del Torro as Tanveer Tivan the collector but he has a little role here. There are other interesting characters played by Lee Pace (the main antagonist), John C Reilly, Karen Gillan and Glenn Close add to the strength of the cast. Creating a franchise movie with new characters and not so famous stars as protagonists is a challenging task. James Gunn has handled it really well. He doesn't bore the audience and also makes them feel involved as if the characters are already 2 or 3 movies old. A very special mention to the CGI and the Visual Effects team and also to every guy/girl who has made technical contribution to this movie. This movie is completely dependent on it. Yes, there will be a sequel and before ending this I quote Peter Quill from the movie, 'You said it, b*tch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy'.",9,13,20,11 August 2014
Logan," An Emotional And Hard Hitting Send-Off For The Immortal Superhero
","The X-Men franchise has seen its ups and downs. Many characters have come and gone. But there was one character that most fans loved the most; The Wolverine.Wolverine is known for his sheer power, brutality, and rebellious attitude. Australian actor Hugh Jackman carried the role brilliantly for seventeen years in such a way that it is very difficult to imagine any other actor filling his shoes. Yet all good things must end and his character finally signs off in the just released film Logan.With recent X-Men movies being completely revamped with different timelines and new characters, it was time to let old characters go. Hugh Jackman's age and recent health issues also made him feel that he wouldn't be able to give his best in the coming years. Here he teams up with James Mangold, director of the 2013 film 'The Wolverine', to give the best possible send-off with the intense and emotional Logan.The previous Wolverine movies 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', and 'The Wolverine', were not critics' favourites, nor did they create much havoc at the box office. After being slammed by the critics and some fans for his previous Wolverine venture, Director James Mangold gives us the best Wolverine this time. Being the first R-rated movie of the X-Men franchise, Logan justifies its rating in every possible way. The frustrated Logan and Professor X do not shy away from cursing. The action sequences are raw and not heavily dependent on CGI. The film neatly captures the emotional and physical hardship of Logan as he battles through his inner self and external evils while feeling the responsibility of doing what's right. The movie is not about the mutant Wolverine, but rather the human Logan, which makes it both different from and superior to the rest of Wolverine's films.Logan is set in the year 2029. The timeline follows events after X-Men: Days of Future Past. Mutants are having a tough time surviving, and the Logan's powers are wearing off. He is living an isolated and disastrous life as a limousine driver, while also looking after Professor X whose health has worsened. The tone is gloomy and dark.Logan is approached by a lady who seeks help to protect Laura, a 'special' kid who is being pursued by the evil organization Transigen. Laura is part of their experiment. Circumstances bring Logan and her together as they escape along with Professor X, and Logan slowly learns a dark and bitter truth. What follows are some raw, hard-core action sequences, brilliant performances, and a scintillating climax.The film revolves around Logan, Laura, and Professor X, and their unexpected journey together. An ageing Hugh Jackman fits the role. The character of Wolverine gave him his fame in Hollywood, and he makes sure to do it justice one last time. Fans are bound to experience mixed emotions watching Logan putting on his reading glasses, but there are also many action sequences which remind us of the Wolverine of old. Patrick Stewart as a tired and unstable Professor X also gives his best.The movie has its funny moments thanks to the brilliant chemistry between Logan and Professor X. It almost feels nostalgic watching them arguing over little things and nagging each other, but it is the young Dafne Keen who is the show stealer with her portrayal of Laura, whose actions speak more than words. The sequences with her and Logan fighting together are jaw-dropping.Logan is the perfect ending to one of the great legendary characters of recent times. The only catch is that this film is very violent and not at all recommended for younger kids. Logan is an action-packed emotional ride, whether you are an X-Men fan or not. I walked away with a heavy heart, as I expect most of you will.",10,4,10,7 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Awesome
","The expectations were high. There were no doubts about that. It was about how different they were going to make this from the first one. Especially considering the standards that the previous Captain America and Thor movies had set. Joss Whedon has delivered and how. This is probably the most intense movie of the Avengers series. There are lot of characters and subtle subplots that you can relate to the comic book. They have made it in such a way that comic book fans are not disappointed as some of them were when they were trying to compare the first avengers with the comic series. Without wasting too much time, The Avengers Age of Ultron gets straight to the point when they try to portray where the movie is leading to. Non comic book fans are introduced to new comic characters like Quicksilver and the Witch. However it is the role of Ultron, as a negative character which brings in a lot to the movie. Unlike the first part, this movie has a more intense antagonist in Ultron and James Spader with his immaculate voice makes sure of that. Also it is advisable to watch Captain America The Winter Soldier to relate to this movie more quickly. The action sequences are very intense, in fact more than half of the movie is filled with action and there is some space for wry humour as well. The Avengers was an unconventional superhero movie at that time by bringing in humour and sarcasm elements with the superhero genre. Age of Ultron is more old school with a lot of hero- villain-revenge-anger confrontations. This time, there is more significance given to the 'science bros' chemistry between RDJ and Mark Ruffalo and it seems cool. Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans quite easily continue to do their part. Scarlett Johansson is more sexy as Natasha Romanoff this time and Jeremy Renner has a meatier role. Elizabeth Olsen excels in some intensive scenes and Aaron Taylor Johnson does a good Russian accent. But Paul Bettany as Jarvis and a cold faced Vision is the standout.Unlike the first part this movie needs more brains and get ready for an intensive Avenger ride.",9,8,19,23 April 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Intergalactic fun ride filled with emotions
","Marvel successfully introduced their lesser known comic book characters with the Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014. It went on to become a blockbuster and also was highly appreciated by the critics. Following its predecessor's success, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 released with much higher expectations than the first part. Director James Gunn not only manages to live up to the expectations and delivers a near perfect fantasy adventure. After saving Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy continue to work as a team and are on a mission to protect the valuable batteries of Sovereign race from an interdimensional monster. After the successful mission, team ends up being attacked by the Sovereign due to Rocket's misadventures. During their escape they encounter Peter Quill's father who takes them to the planet Ego to reveal his origins and his purpose. While Quill and Gamora fight their own personal battles, Rocket, Drax and Groot end up making new allies and strengthen their bonds. The movie is about how Guardians work together again as a team (or should we say family) for saving the Galaxy, again. Vol. 2 is a bit different and more emotional than the first movie. It is also not short of any humour as promised in the trailer. Once again the choice of music is on point which almost make this movie seem as a musical even in intense action sequences. The visual effects are handled brilliantly just like any other Marvel movie. Funny one liners, stupid humour and loads of cuteness with everyone's favorite character Baby Groot makes this movie an enjoyable experience for all age groups. The movie seems a bit out of place in certain scenes, but apart from that it is thoroughly enjoyable.Chris Pratt as Peter Quill has a meaty role in this one as the story revolves around him. While Zoe Saldana and many others cakewalk through their roles, it is Dave Bautista as Drax who steals the show with his funny act. The character if Drax the destroyer has taken a U turn compared to what it was in the first part. Dave Bautista sidelines the fellow funny character Rocket which was the show stealer in the first movie. The character Baby Groot has been so well written and executed so that it is impossible to hate. Even the Ravagers in the movie find it, 'Too adorable to kill'. While veteran actor Kurt Russel plays Ego, Quill's father, Michael Rooker as Yondu has a very significant role as well. Special mention to the actor Sean Gunn as Kraglin whose character is unintentionally funny. Watch out for special appearances in the movie serves as icing on the cake. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is yet another fitting piece in the Marvel cinematic universe. It is thoroughly enjoyable, meaningful and emotionally sound.",9,10,18,11 May 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Go. Watch. Repeat.
","When I 1st saw the trailer for this movie, I told to myself, 'Ah another futuristic, sci-fi, alien and all that VFX movie'. Considering Tom Cruise's last 2 movies Oblivion and Jack Reacher, I wasn't expecting much from this too. Its obvious that Tom Cruise is a global star and hence, one would not need to read reviews much before coming and watching his movies. Since even I am one of those millions of Tom Cruise's fans, I decided to watch the movie. And I have to say, this is probably the surprise blockbuster of the year.Yes, if you read most of the reviews here you would find they have used the word surprise. Tom Cruise plays a not so heroic character of Colonel William Cage who is a media relations officer with the U.S army. The world is on the blink of Alien invasion(or war as they keep calling it) and its all across Europe. The US army is planning to stop the war spreading to the Western countries. For this purpose, there are some Super-Soldier weapons which is headed by Emily Blunt who herself is a role model and have won some important battles. When Tom Cruise goes to meet the general(Gleeson) he's ordered to join the forces at the beach in France. Without Tom Cruises consent, he's arrested and sent as a new recruit. As inexperienced Cruise been sent to battle, for the 1st time, surprising things happen. And from then on, only these 3 words dominate the plot of the movie, Live Die Repeat.With such a futuristic and complicated plot line, there are more chances that things could go possibly wrong. But director Doug Liman has handled it carefully and has put in humor at the right moments so that viewers are not bored. Visual effects are cool and editing is top class. Tom Cruise looks younger compared to his previous movies and good as always. The soldier role suits Emily Blunt really well and makes her look sexier. The other supporting characters don't have much screen space as this movie is most about the 2 main characters. Overall, its a summer blockbuster you don't wanna miss. Heck, you can watch it even 2,3 times.",9,0,2,8 June 2014
Wonder Woman," DC's celebration of a Woman Superhero and everything else
","Woman lead superhero movies have had a tough outing so far at the box office in recent times. The Wonder Woman character when introduced in the Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice was received with an encouraging response. But, there were speculations over whether a standalone film on the character would really work. But Wonder Woman soared at the Box office, broke many jinxes and also has received a great response from critics. Patty Jenkins has done 'wonders' directing her first major motion picture.The movie tells us the origin story of Diana, princess of the Amazon race, where she and other Amazonians are away from the contact of the outside world. When Diana rescues the pilot Steve Trevor, who crashes his plane into their island Themyscira, she comes to learn about the World War I in a hard way. Trying to find her purpose, Diana leaves the island with Steve against her mother's will to end the World War I. Steve teams up with Diana to prevent Germans from using a mass destructive chemical weapon created by an evil scientist. The rest of the movie is about how Diana, Steve and their small team stops the German army general Erich Ludendorff, from using the mass destruction weapon. During this journey, Diana learns more about the humans, finds love and discovers her true identity.Although a Superhero movie, the film also dwells into other human elements which make the movie special. Kudos to the stunt team for some brilliant action sequences, especially involving the character Diana. The chemistry between Steve and Diana almost makes you feel like this is one of the best love stories ever told. The movie also makes sure not to fall short of humor which has been a very key element in the recent superhero movies. The background music and the slow-mo shots are bound to give Goosebumps to the audience. Gal Gadot has landed the role of her life in this movie. Wonder Woman suits her style, personality and also her beautiful face. Her dedication and hard work in preparing for the character reflects really well in the action sequences. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is very adorable and is very sure leaves the audience wanting for more. Although Robin Wright doesn't have much screen time, she has a very powerful role. Other big names like Connie Nielsen, Danny Huston and David Thewlis do justice to their parts. But this movie is totally dominated by the lead characters Diana and Steve. Wonder Woman has to be the DC's best work yet after The Dark Knight trilogy. It is a very well told origin story of a superhero and is filled with emotions. Overall, this movie is not just a celebration of woman power, but it is the celebration of humanity. Wonder Woman makes you smile, it makes you cry and overall gives you a very satisfying movie experience.",10,14,30,12 June 2017
Black Panther," Long Live The MCU
","Another MARVEL hero is here and this time it's not quite the usual stuff. Having been introduced in the Captain America: Civil War, the Wakandan prince returns to the big screen as Black Panther. This is not exactly an origin story, but it's more of a continued chapter of T'challa's life after Captain America: Civil War. The movie tells us the legend of Black Panther and the life in Wakanda which has distanced itself from the rest of the world. The metal, Vibranium plays an important part in all of this which itself is pursued by the evil arms dealer Ulysses Klaue. After his father's death at the UN bombing, T'challa has to prove his worth to the throne while he tries to rid of Ulysses Klaue for good. But the pursuit leads him to know the truth about his uncle and cousin. T'Challa has to protect the misuse of Wakandan resources by fighting his cousin Erik Killmonger who takes over Wakanda by defeating him in a fight. The plot of the movie is simple and also similar to many other superhero movies. However, the cultural and racial backdrop makes this movie very different from others. The city, Wakanda is one of the important aspect of the movie. It is technologically advanced than most part of the world and yet sticking to its cultural roots. Wakanda takes you to a different world altogether. This experience is enhanced by the background score which is very African and amazing costume design. Out of the very few scenes involving the outside world, the Seoul, action scene is a treat to watch. Black Panther lays out a perfect platform for the coloured actors in Hollywood to showcase their talents. Driven by the commercial power of MARVEL Cinematic Universe, this film is going to be a career highlight for most of them. Chadwick Boseman has literally incorporated the phrase 'actions speak more than words' into his acting. He nails the African accent so much that it feels weird when the other characters speak in an American/British accent. Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger is a supercool villain this movie needed. While the movie fails to provide much substance to the characters of popular actors Angela Basset, Forrest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and Lupita Nyong'o, it surely has a lot to offer for Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright. They play the characters Okoye and Shuri respectively, who are almost like side kicks to Black Panther. Marting Freeman as agent Everett K. Ross has a slightly funny role. Black Panther is not as entertaining as the other MCU movies, but it surely has its own charm. A new wave is coming to the Hollywood and Black Panther might have laid a very strong foundation to it.",8,8,19,20 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A good platform for better things to come
","I can't understand all the hate going around about this movie. There is no way that this can be compared to the Nolan's batman trilogy. In the era where comic book movies are delivered to us like factory products every year, Batman v Superman is no different but it is not bad either. Zack Snyder takes a slightly different approach compared to his previous Man of Steel and has made Batman v Superman a conventional comic book movie. Dawn of Justice is dark, loaded with extreme action and old school.The movie picks up from the end of Man of Steel and pits the two protagonists Batman and Superman against one another in their approach towards justice. The introduction of the Batman is kept short but done neatly. The story is based mainly upon the remains from Krypton (Reference: Man of Steel) and their use for evil purposes by the maniac Lex Luthor. Superman is made to look guilty in the eyes of the world and is branded Alien. Billionaire Bruce Wayne a part time vigilante who stops crime and plans on stopping Superman to save the world privately investigates Lex Luthor and his evil plans. The plot is a tad illogical at times but that doesn't take anything away from superbly shot action sequences and crisp characterization of the lead characters. Haters gonna hate but Ben Affleck has nailed it as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Here Batman is much older and is a no nonsense guy when it comes to fighting crime. Henry Cavill is probably the best Superman ever. Somehow Amy Adams as Lois Lane once again finds herself in important scenes and actions sequences. Jesse Eisenberg has delivered in making Lex Luthor look as psychotic as possible. Jeremy Irons as the butler Alfred is more than a butler here. Gal Gadot is super hot as Wonder Woman and fits well for the role. Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner in a cameo amp up the star value of the cast. The movie is thoroughly entertaining and brings justice (league) to the DC's present and future plans. Don't see the ratings and read negative reviews, go watch this epic battle!",9,2,4,27 March 2016
Thor: The Dark World," 'MARVEL'lous
","When I saw the 1st part of Thor, I didn't have much knowledge of Greek mythology and I thought, since it was building up for a much bigger film(the Avengers), I liked it pretty much though it was like just another superhero film.Now that we have already seen The Avengers and also Ironman3, we know how big the things are going. And MARVEL does nothing wrong while bringing out this new Thor movie. It has all the fine elements of a MARVEL film. Comedy,suspense,action and also a surprise cameo(I'll say no more).This movie's story focuses on the power of Aether which was hidden from Black Elves by Odin's father. Then the story goes on about how Thor stops it from reaching the hands of evil Malekith when the Aether re-surfaces. The best part in the movie is the wry humour, the action of course and a little sentimental touch. And Loki also has a very interesting role in this one. The earth part adds a bit of scientific element to the mythology, thereby making it a complete package.MARVEL's bringing more and more great films with The Avengers franchise and also a good TV series (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D), so we fans are definitely not going to miss this one. And for those who haven't started with this, I advice you people to get MARVEL'D.",9,4,9,10 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Beginning of a new era with the foundation still intact
","Finally, the most anticipated movie of the 2015 is here! After gathering all the hype and hoopla around it over a year, Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't throw in any unpleasant surprises. Taking over from George Lucas, JJ Abrams makes sure he does not disappoint any Star Wars fans or cinema lovers in general. It is quite hard to make a sequel to the movie which had ended almost 30 years ago and especially when it comes to this era where most of the sequels are made just to mint money without a proper story, but Star Wars: The Force Awakens has quite a strong plot to build on. In fact with this movie, it looks like there are more to come.The story is once again about the conflict between 'The First Order' (like the Empire) and 'The Resistance' with the aim of finding lost Luke Skywalker. So for the fans asking where was Luke Skywalker in the trailer, the answer is 'that's what they are trying to find in the movie as well':-). The introduction of new characters Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) fit in the mix perfectly while the classic characters Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3P0 still reminds us of what we watched Star Wars for. Since there is a huge time gap between the last Star Wars movie and this, there are changes with respect to the time when it comes to visual effects and slapstick humour (read Boyega). However the some of the original elements of the Star Wars are still kept intact like, the weird creatures, retro editing, lightsabers, music and of course taking hostages :). The movie is largely entertaining and yet true to the franchise.It is a tough job to star in a movie franchise which is older than you. But Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, not so well known British actors show what they are capable of. John Boyega's timing is excellent. Harrison Ford could sleepwalk the role of Han Solo and we all know that. Oscar Isaac does not have a lot of screenspace but it may change in the upcoming movies. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is okay and Domhall Gleeson tries too hard to fit into the General Hux's character. However as always, Chewbacca and C-3P0 seem evergreen. Star Wars: The Force Awakens lives up to most of the expectations surrounding it. But remember, it is yet another beginning...",9,11,36,17 December 2015
Deadpool," Mean Machine
","Well, the promos promised us how the movie will be. In fact they kinda warned us. MARVEL always takes its movies to a whole new level. But here they have taken it to a parallel universe kind of level. Being the first R rated MARVEL movie, Deadpool is as vulgar as it can be. But it is all very well balanced in an entertaining way. Ryan Reynolds has gone beyond getting into the skin of the character to portray Deadpool. Deadpool is new age filmmaking at its best especially when looked in a sarcastic and satire way.There is not much to be concerned about the story here. It is merely an introduction of the character Deadpool along with his love story. In fact, the movie did surprise me as it revolves around the love story of the lead character. The best part of the movie are its opening credits and ending credits. Be sure not to miss them! It is a hilarious mockery of the movie and Hollywood in itself. But who cares when the movie was meant to be that. When you start finding the movie leaning towards the mainstream, boom comes a funny/sarcastic moment to elevate the scene. The dialogues are extremely well written and this is definitely not recommended for a family viewing even though if all are adults. Action sequences though a little over the top, manage to keep up the pace of the movie. There are many X-Men references, in fact this might be a build up for the upcoming X-Men movies. The only flip side for the movie is not having such a strong story but it is hardly noticeable in all the chaos and comedy.Ryan Reynolds is so unclassicaly classic as Wade Wilson aka Deadpool. It is hard to forget his character in years to come. Morena Baccarin is hot and we know that ;-) Ed Skrein as the main antagonist Ajax looks menacing in fight sequences. Stefan Kapicic is unintentionally funny and Gina Carano looks hotter as Angel Dust. Other characters are hardly significant but they do bring some funny quotient into the movie. Deadpool is in-your-face new age cinema. You can love it or hate it. But it is here to stay.",8,1,9,16 February 2016
Spectre," Crisp, Entertaining but not 'The One'
","Bond films have evolved over the years and especially after the introduction of Daniel Craig. It is also because nowadays audience wants to see films and characters closer to reality unlike the old bond movies which were more inclined towards the characterization of a dream spy with cool gadgets. Sam Mendes' second consecutive directorial somewhat hovers around the Skyfall tone along with the old bond charisma. It is thoroughly entertaining and very well filmed, but at the end, you feel something's missing and even you don't exactly know what it is.The movie almost picks off from where the Skyfall left as far as Bond and M's character's are concerned. The mission again this time is more personal along with the 'going rogue' concept. The script also tries to bring in the concept of information monitoring and manipulation and a new organization taking over the '00' program because it is too old school. The same conflict can be seen in the director's mind as well. At part's the movie does justice to the Bond character like womanizing, alcohol and a typical villain character who enjoys the charade. However on the other hand one could see the new bond movie where the gadgets are not always his friend and the Bond experiencing downfall at times. The intensity shown in the trailer is not as much in the movie itself. It is may be because I personally expected too much after seeing Skyfall which was so intense and well written. However there are other people who hated Skyfall and they might find this movie better. The visuals are breathtaking and so is the action credit to brilliant cinematography. Now having visited London, I am being able to relate to the movie better at times as well. Background score and some really well written dialogues make sure that one does not know how the 140 odd minutes go.The characterization is the tricky part though. Some are very well written and some have been just wasted. Daniel Craig once again gives a masterful performance as Bond with right amount of clichés. The roles of 'M' and 'Q' are slightly different but have their own importance this time. Naomie Harris as Moneypenny moves from field to desk. Lea Sedoux and Dave Bautista make use of their screen space effectively. Andrew Scott has been used well at times but his role is very generic. Monica Belluci is mainly for the glamour and it is very disappointing to see her role is not even half as much as they have projected/promoted it to be. Christoph Waltz has given his best but there his characterization is not good enough. It neither related to revenge nor domination. Spectre is a nice pint of beer that goes down very well down your throat, but it does not give you 'that' kick. And 'that' here is a word only a true cinema lover can relate to.",8,13,34,26 October 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," One hell of a road trip
","There are very few movies which deliver exactly what they promise and Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those few. This is dark, tiring, brutal and a very serious movie. But it is visually brilliant and there is no complication when it comes to the storyline. The movie is nothing like the Mel Gibson starred Mad Max but a unique, Theron- Hardy show. As many of the futuristic movies, this is also set on an apolcalyptic world where there is scarcity of basic elements. It is ruled by 'Immortal Joe' who is considered to be immortal by those below him. But only few like Furiosa (Theron) who knew the truth takes on him by trying to take his many wives away from him into a better place. Mad Max a prisoner of Immortal Joe who is on neither side happens to be in the midst of this chaos, ends up teaming up with Furiosa to reveal the truth to the people.The film is packed with ruthless action, some epic BGM by Junkie XL who got us that pump up feeling in 300: rise of an empire as well. It is a bit tiring to watch the first 20-25 minutes, but once you start getting the hang of the story, it gets us involved very soon. Tom Hardy hardly speaks in the movie and Charlize Theron has a very important role. Nicholas Hoult is brilliant. A very unique role for him. Other hot girls like Rosie Huntington Whitley are for the pleasant sight at times. If you are a fan of action genre, this is a movie you must not miss. All credit to the director for the grand presentation of the simple storyline.",10,21,41,26 May 2015
The Martian," Not just another space adventure
","With the novel being already quite famous, The Martian was already surrounded by a good vibe. The movie delivered what exactly the trailer promised. With Ridley Scott in the director's chair hardly few things could go wrong (forget exodus;-)). Narration and screenplay play a major part in this movie. Visual effects are a plus point especially in the climax sequence which is shot to perfection. The plot is hardly anything more than what is shown in the trailer. Matt Damon gets stranded in mars after a NASA expedition gone wrong. With the crew on another mission, its up to Matt Damon and his intelligence and experience to survive in mars until the rescue arrives. There is a whole lot of tongue in cheek humour in the movie which keeps the audience interested. Though there are a few over the top and cheeky sequences, the screenplay is pretty decent. There is a whole lot of science and biology involved to satisfy the nerd brains. In time to come there might be articles pointing out the scientific inaccuracies but lets face it no science movie can be perfect. The movie does not go overdramatic like other science fiction by trying to introduce an antagonist role when there is no need of one which is the biggest plus point. The star cast of this film is pretty huge and is bound to attract a huge number of audiences. Many of them get a very little screenspace as expected. Matt Damon appears in a very cool role after a long gap. Chiwetel Ejiofor has a major role and he reminds us of his '2012' performance. Jeff Daniels has nothing much to do apart from keeping a stern face. I felt Jessica Chastain role could have been written better. Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan , Kristen Wiig and Aksel Hennie just increase the star power. Oh and BTW, Sean Bean lives;-) The only downside of the movie is it is a bit lengthy. But the movie is awesome enough to go and have a nice Mars experience.",8,2,69,30 September 2015
Furious 7," A great tribute and a good movie
","Its very hard to criticize this movie even if you want to. It is a commendable an effort by the whole team to bring a great tribute to one of their family members, Paul Walker. We were quite clear of the magnitude of this movie when they showed Statham at the end of 6th part. So the expectations were high. Though the story isn't that great, the team tries its best to keep the audience entertained. Since there are lot of big stars in this movie, the director makes sure everyone has substantial role even if it isn't necessary sometimes. Jason Statham entry scene is epic. This movie stays true to the initial Fast and Furious movies when it comes to cars and to the latest parts when it comes to outrageous action scenes. But who is complaining?This is probably the movie with most emotional touch after the death of a leading actor. The Paul Walker tribute moves anyone in tears. Especially the last scene, wow... its just.. very hard to describe. Such a great way to retire a character. I can see how difficult it would have been the actors to perform in scenes without actually Paul being there. I wish the rivalry between Vin Diesel and Statham would have had much more magnitude. Nathalie Emmanuel is hot and impressive. Tyrese Gibson has everyone in splits as always. But remember, its Paul Walker who not only steals your show but also your hearts with his superhuman presence. All I can say is 'Thank you team and Miss you Paul'.",8,0,2,17 April 2015
