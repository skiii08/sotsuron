The Devil's Advocate," Don't know how to rate this
","OK...Here is an almost perfect movie.Keanue Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, a hot shot lawyer from Gables, Florida who is spotted by a big New York Law Firm, headed by a man named John Milton (Al Pacino). He is lured into the firm and he and his wife, Mary Anne (Charlize Theron) to New York.At first they are seduced by the posh lifestyle, but slowly, the lifestyle takes on a dark turn. As the secrets of the law firm are revealed, they see that there is more to the charming Mr. Milton than first meets the eye.The cast is wonderful, but I have to say that Pacino stole the movie for me. He is sexy, creepy, seductive and scary, some times all at once. Reeves finally shows that he can be more than just the space-cadet, Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure. We also get to see the first glimmer of incredible from Theron, the kind of incredible people finally recognized in Monster.The cinematography is so good that it becomes part of the movie in a way that few movies do. There are only a few sweeping vistas of New York City, but that doesn't mean the rest of the cinematography isn't spectacular in it's own way.The score blends in with the plot well, moving the story along, but not leading you to far ahead. You can tell the writer knows the bible well and weaves the knowledge throughout the movie.This movie is well worth seeing.",8,1,2,14 April 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Masterpiece!
","I had heard so much about this movie before I saw it. Yet none of what I heard/read prepared me for the brilliance of this movie. Quenton Tarantino knows all the hooks that make a great movie and uses all of them here.It's strange, because, I kinda know what's going to happen throughout the movie, yet the movie kept surprising me. You know Bill has to die at the end, but yet.....There are so many WONDERFUL performances throughout the movie, but two stood out to me: David Carradine, and Daryl Hannah.David Carradine is brilliant with his understated performance, going from affable, to menacing quickly and smoothly. You understand his side of things at the end and find yourself thinking....'Well, maybe' before you remember that there were other people in that chapel besides The Bride and he is a hardened killer who, although he regrets what he did to The Bride, he never expresses remorse for the others.Daryl Hannah shows another side to her acting which, in my humble opinion, was just as shocking as seeing Charlize Theron in Monster. The public is not used to seeing Hannah as a hardened character. She usually plays the sweet, lovely girl. The films I have seen her in have all been fluffy and light. Even Clan of the Cave Bear wasn't as gritty as the book had been. I feel she comes into her own in this movie and shows what a real craftsman she can be.One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it was a serious movie that didn't take itself seriously. There were several moments when you couldn't help but smile (the scene where The Bride is being taught by Pei Mei is a classic!) At the end, when they show scenes from the movie as they roll credits, when they show David Carradine...well, ya gotta see it to believe it...BRILLIANT!!!!!!!",9,2,4,22 January 2005
Walk the Line," The man in black will live on
","I have loved Johnny Cash and his music since I can remember. This movie is a great way to memorialize the man and the great love of his life, June Carter-Cash.Joaquin Phoenix plays Cash with dignity and honesty, showing us everything, the good, the bad, and the ugly. And for a man who is not primarily a singer, Phoenix does a great job with Cash's songs.Oh, and who knew the Reese Witherspoon, known for roles like Elle Wood in Legally Blonde, and Melanie Smooter in Sweet Home Alabama could sing like that! She is a multi-talented actress and really shines as June Carter.I had known that Johnny Cash and June Carter had been married for 35 years, but I never knew what it took for them to get together. This movie gives a fair overview of the trials and tribulations that they had to go through before they could be together.One of the things I loved about this movie is that the background music, for the most part, is music from Cash and Carter. It helped tell the story almost as much as any dialog could.",9,1,2,31 March 2006
The Ring," The best horror movie I have ever seen
","When this movie came out in the theater, I passed on seeing it.  I thought it was going to be another hack-and-slash-how-many-ways-can-you-kill-a-person movie.  I was bored to death with that kind of movie and couldn't see wasting the price of a ticket on it.Boy, was I wrong!Knowing my penchant for good horror flicks, my best friend got me a copy of The Ring for my birthday.  She told me the reviews it had been getting, and another friend recommended it too.   I still set it aside for some time when I was bored and had nothing else to do.  Well, that night was last night, and I must admit to being a little tired while I'm writing this because I didn't sleep last night.  Literally.  I think it was 5am before I stopped seeing images from the movie in my mind. 
This is what horror should be.  It is thought provoking, scary, entertaining, and disturbing.  There are none of the gross-outs of some of the other horror movies out there.  There are also no pat answers to the mystery involved.This is a MUST SEE.  Even though it disturbed me, I know it's going to be one I watch over and over again.  I can't wait for the second movie to come out!",10,0,1,16 March 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Grand Silliness
","I loved this movie. Harrison Ford is great as Indiana Jones. It is basically a comic book movie that doesn't take itself seriously. There are no shades of gray in this movie, either. The bad guys are bad, and the good guys are good. George Lucas understands what a movie like this needs to be. It is a thrill ride. There are surprises with the special effects, and surprises with the dialog through the whole movie, but the story line is very predictable.But that's OK...it's like going on your favorite roller coaster over and over again. You know when the twists and turns are coming, but it doesn't lessen the thrill you feel going through them.",9,1,3,31 December 2004
Finding Neverland," Never grow up
","Finding Neverland is the fictionalized story of J. M. Barrie's Platonic relationship with a widow and her sons. It also shows how they change each others' lives for the better and how Barrie gets his inspiration for Peter Pan.Johnny Depp is at his best here. I think people have gotten used to him playing strange characters so they are reluctant to accept him in this role, but he proves that he is a truly talented actor.Kate Winslet also shows her skill as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the widow trying to cope with four young boys and a meddling mother-in-law (Julie Christie, at her best!) The movie takes us in and out of the fantasies of Barrie. Usually, I find this tactic distracting, but it works here. There are so many surprises in this movie, it's a joy to watch.",8,2,3,20 April 2006
Underworld," Better than people want to admit
","I can understand why some people were unwilling to give this movie a chance. I started out thinking, OK, so Anna Valerious from Van Helsing is now a female Blade! I was wrong! I also went in thinking it was going to be a push button movie with no real twists.Again I was wrong.I didn't really see the twist coming at the end (surprising, since I figured out who Kaiser Sosay was!) I liked this move for a lot of reasons. The darkness in the movie wasn't oppressive. The acting was good, and the story strong.I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,146,233,11 January 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A great swashbuckling tale!
",Great movie!  Johnny Depp makes a great pirate and Orlando Bloom proves that he really can act.  The plot is wonderful and anyone who has been through the ride at Disney will get a kick out of certain scenes in the movie.It's a definate do not miss for me!!!!,Null,0,0,1 September 2003
Elizabeth," Great Movie
","Cate Blanchette is wonderful in this historical drama.  the only actress to play a better Queen Elizabeth I, is Bette Davis in The Virgin Queen. Blanchette breathes life into the roll of Queen Elizabeth I, showing her poise and grace during difficult times in her life.  Spoilers ahead.We see her go from a spoiled (?) niave young girl to a savy queen who can stand up to any man in a male dominated world.  It's full of intrigue, and betrayal.The costumes are lush and luscious, the scenery is fantastic and the supporting cast are brilliant.",Null,2,4,26 February 2004
Ice Age: The Meltdown," An unexpected pleasure
","OK...I usually avoid sequels....especially animated sequels. They tend to be derivative, almost plot less wastes of time.I cringed when I heard they were making a sequel to Ice Age. After all, the first was so good, any sequels were bound to be bad, right? WRONG! Ice Age 2 is a fully recognized movie in and of itself. It makes references to the first movie, but doesn't depend on it for the plot to work. The jokes are original and genuinely funny.OK...so the rational side of my brain is telling me that a mammoth couldn't hang by it's tail from a tree or stay under water that long, but the side that can quote all the old bugs bunny cartoons is telling me to stop being so dang literal about things and enjoy it.This movie is what animation should be! Oh, and I'm STILL waiting for poor Scrat to get that acorn!!!",10,8,10,7 April 2006
The Mummy," More comic book than anything else
","I loved this movie...it is complete mind popcorn and knows it. I've read some of the reviews and it seems to me that some people are a bit harsh.OK..It's not great cinema. But it has it's moments!There is a wonderful chemistry between everyone in the cast and you can tell they just had a blast filming it!The violence is cartoon violence, which is always a plus to me (wnterstar braces for the onslaught of complaints from people who want stark realism!)The cinematography was terrific and the special effects fantastic.The acting was good if taken on a comic book level. Brendon Frasier makes a great classic adventure hero, and he has a wonderful chemistry with Rachel Weisz. Arnold Vosloo is great as Imotep (who says a mummy can't be sexy!) But it was Oded Fehr who stole the movie for me. He was great at portraying competence and wisdom touched with a child-like love of life.This movie isn't for everyone (My best friend just doesn't get it!) but those of us who appreciate a touch of whimsy and have our tongues firmly planted in our cheeks, it's a wonderful thing!",Null,0,1,10 December 2004
The Others," Unique and Creepy
","I am always looking for a good ghost movie and most of the ones I've seen lately haven't done it for me so I didn't go into this one expecting anything much from it. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It is suspenseful, creepy and has a relatively unique twist at the ending, which I refuse to give here.The slow moving plot builds up a little at a time, and reveals itself in little bits. It's as if someone has taken a jigsaw puzzle and scattered the pieces for us to find along the way. When we finally get the pieces together, the picture shows us...no...wait...I won't tell you what it shows.You need to gather the pieces yourself to find out. With a wonderful score, and scenery that makes you want to pack up and move to the UK.",9,0,2,6 April 2006
Troy," OK...so it's not historically accurate!
","The word sweeping cinematography was made for this movie. It is visually spectacular. The battle scenes were stunning, and the backdrops were lush.The script was good and the storyline was very engaging and believable, if historically inaccurate.And there was lots of eye candy for us women. I will admit that I never got Brad Pitt, but after this movie, I get it. Then you add in Eric Bana, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom. Wow! I only give this movie a seven because I felt it was needlessly bloody in places, and some of the acting was mediocre at best. Still, if you get the chance, it's not a bad way to spend an evening!",7,5,10,4 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Hauntingly Beautiful!
","This movie goes down as one of the most haunting I've ever seen. It's the story of star-crossed lovers with a twist. Ennis Delmar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two cowboys hired to watch a herd of sheep over the summer. During that summer, they have only each other for company and get to know each other very well. The rest of the story is how their relationship affects their lives. They can't be together, but being apart is almost torture, not only for them, but for their families. It was not about sex but about their deep, passionate, enduring love. The sex scenes were tastefully shot, not graphic, and not sleazy.Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing and the only bad thing I can say about Heath Ledger's acting is that I wanted to tell him to stop mumbling several times during the film. The supporting cast was terrific as well.The only real problem I had with the film is that I thought a couple of the scenes were needlessly brutal. That's the only reason this film gets a 9 instead of 10.",9,2,5,6 January 2006
Crash," Something to think about
","This is an astounding movie with some outstanding performances. Here is a movie that will make you look about how you deal with the people around you.Just be prepared to not like what you see.The stories of several different, and seemingly unrelated people intertwine in Crash for better or for worse. You see how normally good people have prejudices that surface at times of stress; The white police officer who, after many years on the job, goes to far when pulling over a black couple, the Pakistani shop owner who goes after the wrong man after his store is trashed; the black woman screaming racial slurs at a Chinese woman after a car accident.Almost everyone will see a bit of themselves in these people.We also see wonderful moments of realization (which I won't give away here!)that gives us hope for ourselves.I only have two problems with this movie, and minor ones at that. The first is that the music is loud and detracts from the movie. The other thing is that, even though we are left with a feeling of hope for ourselves at the end, there is no comic relief within the movie at all. There is never the chance to just relax during for a moment. At the end of the movie I was tired.It is definitely a movie to see.",8,1,5,31 March 2006
Closer," Too real to be fun, but still good
","This is an almost too accurate view of relationships. We see how these four dysfunctional people deal with each other over a four year period of time: the frustrated (Jude Law) writer who is obsessed with two women at once, a sex-starved dermatologist (Clive Owen) who is obsessed with one woman, a confused woman (Julia Roberts) who is a confused woman who wants to do the right thing, and Alice, a young girl who seems to be a professional victim (Natalie Portman) and is possibly the most screwed up of the bunch.It's a difficult movie to watch, mostly because it hits home. People don't like to look that closely at their flaws.",8,1,1,31 December 2006
Capote," Stunning and riveting
","This movie should have won the Oscar for the best picture. It has everything a great movie needs: spectacular cinematography, a riveting script, phenomenal actors, and a chilling score.It draws you into the plot slowly and lets you discover your way to the climax. I have never seen a movie where the silences are just as important as any of the words that are said. Capote does more with a 2 minute silence then most movies can do with 20 minutes of dialogue.There are two standout performances in this movie, the first is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Here is an actor who has been around Hollywood for fifteen years and I didn't really know his name until now. When I look at his list of credits, his roles always seem to be ones that people remember, even if they don't know his name. He is fantastic as Truman Capote, capturing the man to a 'T'. Somehow, he made me love Capote and hate him at the same time...not an easy feat! He doesn't minimize the arrogance and self-centeredness that Truman Capote was accused of. I was glad to see him get the recognition he deserves for this role.The other standout performance is Clifton Collins, Jr. Collins is another actor who has been around forever, but in the background. As Perry Smith, one of the two men who killed a family in rural Kansas. His performance will let you see the man behind the murderer as sad, misunderstood and almost frail.That is until we hear him talk about the murders. Then we see in his eyes the madness, the cruelty and the heartlessness that must have been present in the real Perry Smith.This movie is a must see, not only for Truman Capote's fans, but for anyone who is fascinated by true crime dramas.",10,1,1,31 March 2006
Forrest Gump," An endearing movie
","This movie is endearing and fun to watch, but at the same time, it makes you think. It is fresh and innovative, with just the right touch; never too silly. Tom Hanks shines as Forrest Gump, giving the character dignity that few could. Robin Wright Penn is perfect as his best friend/love interest who is dealing with an abusive past. Sally Field gives her usual solid performance as Forrest's patient and loving mother.Forrest Gump is the kind of movie that really makes you think about how you view the world around you, and, especially how you treat other people. It never goes past sweet and touching into preachy.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it gets a perfect 10 from me!",10,0,2,17 April 2006
Grease," Enjoyable and adorable
","Grease is one of the movies I have to watch whenever it comes on. The cast is all wonderful, especially John Travolta, Olivia Newton John and Stockard Channing. The plot is great and is still somehow relevant today. The script is fantastic, full of the best one-liners, ever. But it's the musical numbers that truly shine. The title song, as well as Summer Nights are classics! In most musicals, I come out singing one or two songs, with Grease, I was humming them all! Add in some great cinematography and you have a winning combination for a movie. This is a great movie that deserves a nine out of ten. It is a movie everyone should see!",9,1,3,21 April 2006
The Village," Sublimely Creepy
","This is a hard movie to review, because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.It is a subtle, slow-paced movie, with standout cinematography, and a fairly decent twist at the end. The cast is amazing, bu the standout for me was Bryce Dallas Howard, who proves that talent does run in families (her father is Ron Howard). The rest of the cast brings with them formidable resumes, and they live up to expectations.The critics panned this movie, and I can see why, but I also think that they were a bit hard on it because they have come to expect more of M. Night Shyamalan (who, as usual, has a small part in the movie!) I think if it had been made by anyone else, they wouldn't have been quite as hard on it.I will say that I did see the twist coming, but knowing didn't lessen any of the enjoyment for me.",8,0,2,6 April 2006
The Shining," Twisted and scary
","The Shining, based on Stephen King's novel, is the story of a writer, Jack Torrance(expertly played by Jack Nicholson) who, along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son, Danny become the winter caretakers of a hotel that is closed for the summer hoping that the peace and quiet will help him write his next novel.Gradually, the quiet is no longer peaceful. Jack, discovering that the hotel is haunted by the ghosts of a former caretaker and the family he murdered, slowly begins losing his mind. What follows is a frightening look into the mind of a mad man, and the family that has to cope with it.Technically, this is a great movie. The acting is amazing, the script is great, and the cinematography is out of this world. There are also some scenes that will keep you up at night! The only problem I have is that it isn't as scary as the book. Stephen King's books don't translate well to movies because he understands that anything you imagine is many, many times scarier than anything a movie shows you!",7,0,1,20 April 2006
Spider-Man," One of the best comic book adaptations ever
","This movie surprised me in several ways.First of all, it was the first movie I saw Toby McGuire in. He shows that he is a talented, versatile actor.Secondly, this is the first movie I saw Kirsten Dunst play an adult. I remember her as Claudia in 'Interview with a Vampire'. She has matured as an actress nicely.Thirdly, I've always know that Willem DeFoe is a great actor, but the scene where he is talking to the goblin in the mirror was fantastic.The story is riveting and entertaining, the cinematography and special effects are spectacular. But the acting is what made this movie great. Everyone, from the main players to the minor characters were great in this movie. They treated the movie with respect, rather than making it a cartoon.It is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.",8,0,1,5 June 2005
Ocean's Eleven," Mind popcorn
","***SPOILERS*** I watched this movie because the guy I was dating at the time sat me down one night and said I HAD to see it. I am so glad he did.This movie is a fun, silly respite from reality. You can tell by watching it that all of the people involved in the movie had fun making it.Brad Pitt and George Clooney have a great chemistry that shines. All the supporting cast not only work with that chemistry, but bring their own nuances to it.The plot is simple...let's go steal money from the casinos. You go into the movie KNOWING that they make it. The joy of the movie is watching the journey.It's not a perfect movie. I'm sure if I looked at the movie too critically, I could find hundreds of errors and flaws.I chose not to look that close, and recommend that you do the same.",8,7,9,1 January 2005
The Usual Suspects," A slow moving, riveting mystery/thriller
","Most movies are like taking the highway from point A to Point B. OK...sometimes you do get off the beaten path and take an exit you didn't expect, But it's still point A to point B.This movie, however, takes all the back roads, some of them unpaved and very bumpy, some of them narrow and curvy, and some of them downright scary! I am not going to give away ANYTHING in this movie, because I believe it would be a disservice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie before. I will only say that it's one of the best whodunits I have ever seen! Kevin Spacey is spectacular with his understated performance. He and the rest of the cast work magic with this wonderful script.The cinematography, while not being sweeping vistas, move the story along nicely, and the score is foreboding, without obviously leading you.The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I figured a key point out before it was revealed.What that key point is, I'm not going to say!",9,1,1,4 April 2006
Resident Evil," A glorious waste of time!
","This movie was visually stunning and the special effects were nothing short of spectacular.That's about the best thing I can say about this movie. I realize that the movie is based on a video game, but the plot is loose at best. the film makers seem to think that the way to make a good movie it to throw in all the movie clichés possible.1. The beautiful heroine, who just happens to have temporary amnesia who ends up wearing a skimpy outfit throughout the movie.2. The heroine being betrayed by someone she trusts.3. Someone HAS to go off on their own, and ends up getting killed.4. The score is so overdone that things that you miss the truly disturbing stuff and focus on the wrong stuff.There were no real shocks in the movie...they were all contrived, cheap scares that last barely as long as you are in the theater. And I'm sorry, when I saw the killer rabbit all I could think of is Montey Python and the Holy Grail 'It wasn't just any bunny...It was a vicious man-eating bunny....with big sharp teeth!' Having said that, I gotta say I enjoyed the movie. I gave it a 5 out of 10!",5,1,2,7 January 2005
Dirty Dancing," Nostalgia meets reality
","Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Grey)and her family as they spend the summer at Kellerman's Family Summer Camp. We get to see her discover herself as she falls in love with the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze).The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!) some great music, and terrific scenery. It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending! You know how it's going to end from the beginning, but that's really not the point here. The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!",9,10,15,20 April 2006
Gone with the Wind," The Ultimate Romance
","This is the ultimate love story. This is probably the best cast movie of all times. With the possible exception of Burton and Taylor, there never was a better on screen couple than Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh. Olivia de Havelland was absolutely lovely as the kind hearted Melodie. And who will ever forget Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes...I understand Scarlettes obsession with him!But the person who made the movie for me was Hattie McDaniel as Mammie. She may play a slave/servant in the movie, but she NEVER considered herself less important or lower than anyone else in the movie. She was amazing in the roll.Such care was taken in this movie to get everything just right, and it shows. It is full of lines that have been repeated and satirized over the years. One of the things that stands out the most for me was the amazing cinematography. The colors are rich and beautiful. The other thing that stands out is the memorable characters...these are people we all know and recognize, put into situations they can't control.I consider this mandatory viewing for anyone who is serious about movies. Just be sure to have a lot of tissues handy!!!!",10,1,1,20 April 2006
Legends of the Fall," Not a bad way to spend an evening!
","***spoilers*** I like this movie. There are a lot of strong performances from all the actors. But with a cast like this, how could you go wrong.This is a haunting story that weaves a spell over the viewer. You really care about all of the characters, weeping when Samuel dies, laughing and joyful with the birth of Tristan's children and feeling a sense of righteous indignation, anger and hatred when Isabel two is murdered (OK...I don't buy the 'it was a tragic accident' line either!) Any movie that can make you feel all those emotions in a three hour period is brilliant to me! There are some scenes that are difficult to watch, and I question whether we really need to see some of them so I can't really give it a 10 out of ten.How about a 9 1/2 out of ten?!?",Null,3,5,5 January 2005
The Little Mermaid," Almost as good as the Disney Classics
","I grew up watching all the Disney Classics like Snow White, and Bambi. Before this movie came out, I had written off Disney animated films.This is a retelling of the classic Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale about a mermaid (Ariel)who falls in love with a human. She goes to the fearsome sea witch (Ursula) for help. The sea witch agrees to help, but the cost is high, she wants Ariel's voice. Now, human legs in place, she has three days to get the prince to fall in love with her and kiss her.Here is where this movie gets 'Disneyfied' and gets a happier ending than the classic. In the classic fairy tale, she doesn't win out. Instead, she throws herself back into the sea where she bursts into a million bubbles.Having said that, the music, the animation and the script are all up to the original Walt Disney standards and is definitely worth watching...over and over again!",8,1,1,25 November 2006
Ghost Rider," Both entertaining and a disappointment
","I will admit I watched this movie purely because I love Nick Cage. I didn't go in expecting much of the movie because, with very few exceptions, movies that are made from comic books just can't do them justice.This has to be the case here. The acting is fairly good (Wes Bentley is GREAT as Blackheart!) and the special effects were decent (they must have been awesome on a large screen!) It was even a decent story-line.What it lacked was answers. (here is where the spoilers come in, people...fair warning!!!) If the contract was so powerful, why did Mephistopheles not hunt The Caretaker down earlier? Was it because he was on Hallowed ground? I also didn't like how they ended things with the Caretaker - what happens to him? Does he find redemption? Then there is Blackheart's gang...we know NOTHING about them. Why are they willing to follow him? I guess I feel like I watched half a movie, there was SO much missing from this movie.",6,1,2,25 August 2007
Hellboy," Great comic book movie!
","Possible spoilers!I'm going to be honest...I went to see Hellboy for two reasons...I am a paranormal investigator, and I love Ron Perlman.I wasn't disappointed.  This was a fun thrill ride. The bad guys are well done, and the creatures were fantastic!   Ron Perlman was wonderful in the part.  Wearing prosthetics makes it difficult to portray emotions, yet you can read Hellboy's easily!My only pet peeve with this movie was the lack of a 'tying up the loose ends' scene.  What happened with Clay?  I mean, did he die?  And what happened to Dr Manning?  Is he still in that tiny room?  Did he and Hellboy remain on friendly terms?I have the sneaking suspicion that this was left up in the air to pave the way for Hellboy 2.  If this is the case, I will be the first in line",Null,0,0,10 April 2004
Ghostbusters," A classic
","What can I say?  This movie is a classic!  It has it all, great acting (OK...Bill Murry and Rick Moranis maybe a TAD bit over the top at times, but it works!). The special effects are amazing.  The story line is great, and the gags have the lasting power the marks great comedies. 
It's been out 20 years, and people still quote this movie!I'm a paranormal investigator, and the group I work with lists Ghostbusters as required viewing.  It has little to do with reality, but it's a wonderful fantasy!This movie is a 10 out of 10!",10,12,21,13 July 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A sad spectacular movie
","I liked this movie quite a bit. It was visually stunning, and all the actors were marvelous in it.I loved the way the modern songs were woven through the movie. When I heard the premise, I thought it was going to be dumb, but it worked well. The scene on the rooftop where Satine and Christian sing back and forth to each other was wonderfully done.Spoiler...don't read ahead if you don't want the end spoiled!!! My only problem with this movie is the end. I understand why it ended the way it did, but I can't help feeling that they writers could have let them have some time to be happy together without the duke hanging around.",8,4,5,3 March 2005
Jerry Maguire," good, but I was expecting more
","I'm not really sure why I didn't love for this movie. It has everything a good movie needs: a great cast, a solid script, good cinematography, and a moving score. And maybe that's what's wrong with it. It tries too hard to be a great movie. It seems forced at times.Having said that, I did enjoy the movie and I would even see it again. It's filled with memorable quotes and classic scenes. I mean, who will ever forget Jerry telling Dorothy 'You complete me!' or Jerry yelling 'Show me the Money' over and over again. These quotes, along with others, have become so well known, that they have been satirized in sitcoms and movies.I can only give this a 7 out of 10, but that's still not bad!",7,4,9,5 April 2006
Big Fish," Sweet and endearing without a sugar overload!
","I watched this movie because my mom wanted to see it. I wasn't holding up very high hopes for it.I was wrong!It is wonderful. The story is rich and is told in a unique way as only Tim Burton could do. The characters are engaging, witty and fun to watch. **************Fair Warning....Spoiler Ahead!***************************I think what I liked most about this movie is that, even though Ed Bloom may have exaggerated a bit, all his stories had a bit of truth to them. There is a good moral at the end, but it never preaches, and it never talks down to the audience.This is going on my 10-best list!",10,2,3,9 October 2004
The Mummy Returns," A worth while sequel
","I'm not a great fan of sequels usually. They tend to be derivative and just plain stupid.The Mummy Returns did not fall into that trap. It is just as clever as the first. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weiss reprise their roles as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn Carnahan in the Mummy Returns. This time, they are married and their son has been taken hostage by the newly raised Imotep (brilliantly portrayed by Arnold Vosloo).It is filled with the clever repartee and the cartoonish fights that made the first movie so good. The special effects are terrific and the cinematography leave you wanting to go visit Egypt.OK...It's not great cinema....it's not suppose to be. It is, however a great movie to watch for a night of fun!",8,0,0,21 April 2006
The Last Samurai," Beautiful and Tragic
","Spoilers throughout This is a hard movie for me to review. It has everything a great movie should have, and I really can't think of a thing I would change. The acting is terrific, and I'm not just talking Tom Cruise, whom we've come to expect perfection from. The supporting cast was spot on for everything, even down to the extras. The cinematography is almost legendary, with the wonderful sweeping vistas of the Japanese countryside, to the gritty, closed-in streets of Tokyo. The musical score evokes feelings within the viewer without being overwhelming. Finally, the script is beautifully written.Oh, yeah, the nasty Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) gets it in the end, and I SO needed that to happen! Bottom line here is that, even though you know what's going to happen, the real brilliance of the movie is the journey there.Usually, I would be giving a movie like this a 10, but somehow, I can't. After watching this movie, I felt like they took 130 minutes to make me start to care about these characters, to become involved with their lives, and then the last 20 minutes, you see how they are killed, even if they do die bravely.",9,1,3,15 April 2006
National Treasure," A grand scavenger hunt
","It is said that the best lies are founded in reality. Well, so are the best movies. There is just enough truth about the Knights Templar to make this movie almost believable.Problem is that the treasure would have been found long ago if it's where they found it (and, no...I'm NOT gonna give that away!) Other than that, it has Nick Cage, Sean Bean, and Jon Voight...what more can I say? Actually, with all that talent, it would have been easy to go off the deep end, but they managed to keep it on track.The movie keeps you guessing up until the end, and there is a great gotcha at the end (and no...I'm not gonna give that away, either!!!)",8,0,1,20 April 2006
Pretty Woman," Cinderella rescues her prince!
","How can anyone not love this movie. It's a new take on the Cinderella story that works and doesn't feel tired or derivative at all. OK...you know what happens in the end, but there are so many lovely surprises along the way that it doesn't matter.Richard Gere and Julia Roberts have a wonderful chemistry that pops as Edward Lewis and Vivian Ward. But for me, there are three performances that really steal the movie for me: Hector Elizondo as Barney, the hotel manager, Laura San Giacamo as Kit De Luca, Vivian's best friend, and Jason Alexander as Phillip Stuckey, Edward's best friend. They prove to the viewer that the supporting cast can be just as important at the leading roles.",9,0,1,15 April 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Just right!
","One of the hardest things to do is to take a novel and condense it down into a movie. It takes great restraint and a brilliant mind to pull it off.Well, Chris Columbus pulls it off! First of all, the casting was phenomenal. Daniel Radcliff IS Harry Potter. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint bring Hermione and Ron to life. The other stroke of genius in casting was Alan Rickman. Rickman brings unexpected nuances to the character of Professor Snape.The score is soaring and uplifting. The cinematography is superb, with the rich soaring colors one would expect from the wizarding world.My only complaint (and it's a small one) is that they left out Peeves the Poltergiest. Not a major character, but one, I'm sure that many who are fans of the books will agree, that I had been looking forward to seeing brought to...I don't know...can you say 'life' about a poltergeist?!? 9/10...one to own and watch so often you memorize it!!!",9,0,2,6 April 2006
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Back to Hogwarts!
","It's back to the Wizarding world with Harry Potter. The cast that brought the first movie to life are back, with an absolutely brilliant addition, Jason Isaacs as Luscious Malfoy, Draco Malfoy's deliciously evil father.Again, the script writers condense a full novel down to a 161 minutes in a way that, rather that leaving you feeling cheated by what was left out, you want to go back and read the book again.The breathtaking cinematography and instantly recognizable score take the viewer into the wizarding world where we find Harry on his way through his second year at Hogwarts. He and his two best friends, Ron and Hermione, thought they were going to have a quiet year at Hogwarts. Instead they end up trying to find out who opened the chamber of secrets and set a monster loose in the castle.Along the way, we learn a little more about Hogwarts and some of it's past students, including Tom Riddle, a charming young man who is much more than he seems.",10,3,6,7 April 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Fun action flick
","This is a fun movie, not a good movie. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a wonderful chemistry that make this movie a joy to watch. The cinematography is good and the chase and fight scenes are breathtaking and original.The plot, while not totally original, still provides a couple of good surprises along the way.If you go into the movie with the idea that you are going to have a wonderful cinematic experience, you will be sorely disappointed. My suggestion is to get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy this fast-paced action flick!",8,0,1,20 April 2006
War of the Worlds," Orson Wells is turning over in his grave!
","I was so looking forward to this movie. And I was so disappointed. They took a terrific story and ruined it for me by making the characters unlikable.Take Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise). I know he is supposed to represent everyman, but I found him to be self-serving, selfish and arrogant. And his daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) to be a spoiled brat who's father wouldn't let her grow up.The only one I liked in the movie was Robbie Ferrier, Ray's son. He did the things that I felt his father should have done in the movie.Maybe the problem is that I wanted the leading man to be a hero, not an everyman. The streets were full of everymen during the crowd scenes.The sound mixing was poor. At times you could barely hear the dialog, but then when the Martians attack, it's too loud.Oh, and they changed the martians, too. Now they are no longer tripods.",6,1,3,5 April 2006
Wedding Crashers," Funny, but painful at times
","I should have loved this movie. The cast was wonderful (each of the characters were caricature's of people we all know). Usually, I see one actor that stands out from the rest, but I think all the performances were stand out performances. The jokes went from witty to outrageous (the scene at the table was really well done!) But I didn't love this movie. I found that some of the scenes dragged a bit, and some of the jokes bordered on bad taste (A FUNERAL crasher?!?) and the movie went into painful and exceedingly bitter at times.Bottom line, this is a good movie to see when you want a nonsense movie with a heart!",7,2,3,4 September 2005
Ice Age," Sabertooths, Sloths and Mammoth's--OH MY!
","This animated film is up to the standard of the classic Disney animation. It has a wonderful plot that pulls you in and has you rooting for the characters. The characters themselves are charming and likable. The vocal talents of Ray Romano as Manny the Mammoth, Dennis Leary as Diego the Sabertooth and John Leguizamo as Sid the Sloth, and a slew of supporting voices breath real life into the animated, but not cartoonish, characters.In the movie, the three main characters get thrown together in the quest to reunite a lost human child with his 'pack'. Along the way, they learn to understand and care about each other. It is a heartwarming story, and might seem predictable. But it isn't.There are plenty of surprises along the way.Oh, and there's poor Scrat, one of these days, he might actually get to keep the acorn he's chasing.Actually, the scenes with scat are what keep it from being a perfect 10 for me. They go on a bit long for my taste.",9,0,0,6 April 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nurse Ratched meets her match
","This is the story of Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he enters a mental institution. In the institution, he meets Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a cruel, unyielding nurse who makes life unbearable for the patients. After McMurphy has a few run ins with Ratched, he is sent for shock treatments, and war breaks out on ward.This is an intense movie with some great performances all around. It is creepy and has all the earmarks of a great movie. The soundtrack is great, and the script is good.I give this movie an eight out of ten because of the stellar performances and the great plot!",8,0,2,21 April 2006
The Terminal," A charming movie worth more than a second glance!
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!!!!!!
I found this movie utterly charming.  Tom Hanks is wonderful as Viktor Navorsky, a man who finds himself in limbo after his country's government is overthrown.  His papers are no longer any good, so he can't go to New York and he can't go home.The story is about all the lives he touches during his time in the terminal- from a flight attendant with a skewed view on relationships (Catherine Zeta Jones)to a man wanted for assaulting a police officer in India (Kumar Pallana, who, by the way stole the show for me!!)to the Homeland Security Chief (Stanley Tucci) who he teaches that people mean more than rules and regulations.  He even acts as cupid to a wayward couple (Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana).  I think it was Walt Disney who coined the term 'Plausible Implausabilities'. Basically what it means is taking something you patently know can't happen and make it believable.  It's been used in cartoons for decades.Speilberg perfect for live action here.  If you look too long at the plotline, you will see that it just couldn't really happen, and yet...There are plenty of feel good moments, some really tense moments, and a wonderful ending.Four stars out of four!",Null,1,2,4 July 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Moving and hopeful
","This movie touched me, but I'm finding it hard to review.It is the story of a man who, after being convicted to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, still manages to find hope and a reason to live. We see him first come to grips with the way his life is, then we see him begin to see how he could change it for the better.It is full of memorable characters who each have something to share with us if we are willing to listen. It will make you angry when an injustice is revealed, it will make you smile at a small bit of good fortune and even the hardest hearted person would have a hard time not shedding a tear during certain scenes.Redemtion is possible and may be right around the corner!",9,0,0,6 April 2006
Scream," A roller coaster ride!
","Scream to me is a great roller coaster ride.  This movie manages to poke fun at all the horror movies that have gone before it, while still managing to be scary in it's own right.I felt the acting was actually fairly good and the scares came at a good pace.It also kept me guessing until the end.  I can usually figure out who the killer is, but this movie kept me guessing.Spoilers ahead:My favorite scene has to be when the reporter and the cop are in the van watching the video feed of the party on a 30 second delay.  They are watching one of the guys who has been enjoying his favorite horror flick. The guy in the house starts talking to the screen saying 'he's right behind you' and, unbenknownced to him, the killer is right behind him.  The people in the van start yelling at the screen 'he's right behind you!!!'Classic!",Null,1,2,22 June 2004
Vanilla Sky," Jacob's ladder meets the Matrix
","This is a movie gone wrong...terribly wrong. This is just sad, because it has a great cast, a brilliant director, absolutely breath-taking cinematography, CGI effects that boggle the mind and a score that's amazing.The problem, I guess, is in the plot and the script. There is absolutely nothing new, nothing innovative with them. They are completely derivative of much better movies. And the end....well, to me, that's just a rip off. Anyone who has taken a BASIC creative writing class knows that this kind of ending is a cop out.If you want a good movie that blurs the lines of reality then watch the Matrix trilogy.",4,0,1,16 April 2006
Signs," Riveting
","I was mesmerized by this movie.  I equate it to on of those free fall rides. A slow rise up higher and higher, where you can see things you wouldn't normally see from the ground, then, when you can hardly take the suspense anymore....wham!  your in for the ride of your life!The story centers around Reverend Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his family, who are still trying to come to grips with the loss of his wife (Patricia Kalember) when they find mysterious crop circles in their field.The story triggered some basic nerve in me.  It's hard to watch in parts,and can be very brutal.But it stuck with me, and I'm not sure why.Spoilers ahead!There are plot holes in it. (Uhm...why would an alien race that can be killed by water come to a planet that is 70% water?) But the acting is great, and the premise is creepy.All in all, I would give it a 7 1/2 out of 10",Null,0,2,10 July 2004
Shall We Dance," An old-fashioned movie for today
","SPOILERS!I will be the first to say that I wasn't holding out much hope for this movie. I mean it has J-Lo in it, for heaven's sake! And Richard Gere dancing? You gotta be kidding me! I thought Susan Sarandon must be crazy getting mixed up with a movie like this!I was wrong, on all accounts!It's the story of a man who is searching for his identity (Gere) and finds it in ballroom dancing and the lives he touches along the way. His inspiration is the lovely, but aloof Paulina (J-Lo). One of the things I liked most about this film, is they didn't go the traditional cheating husband route.OK...that's simplified a bit, but you get the idea.J-Lo proved to me that she is not only a good actress, but a wonderful dancer too. I was tired just watching some of the routines!I had heard that Richard Gere could dance, but never seen any proof of it (the tap dancing he did in Chicago is MUCH different from ballroom dancing!)Susan Sarandon, as always, was superb!Stanley Tucci was touching and impressive as Link Peterson, a straight man with a passion for dancing. Lisa Ann Walter steals many of the scenes she's in. Not only can she dance, but she has wonderful comedic timing.That's not to say that there weren't some wholes in the plot. OK, one major one. I have taken ballroom dance classes. You don't get to the level the newbie dancers got to in just 8 weeks! Maybe one of them could POSSIBLY be a quick study, but not all of them!Bottom line....This movie brings us back to the old-time Fred Astair/Ginger Rogers movies (the movie even gives a a brief no to them !)",10,1,2,10 December 2004
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," The best novel to screen presentation I've ever seen
","I am a big Vampire Chronicles fan. Anne Rice has given us a wonderfully different view of the vampire...the vampire as the protagonist, the hero. I read each and every one of her books as soon as they came out. I was a little concerned when they announced that they were making a movie of the book.Then I heard that they were casting Tom Cruise as Lestat. Well, that was plain wrong to me...the brunette Cruise, playing the blonde Lestat? Then I heard the blonde Brad Pitt was going to play the dark haired Louis...again....wrong!!! I decided that I was going to see it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised when Tom Cruise brought Lestat to life just the way I pictured him. And Brad Pitt makes you care about Louis and what he has become.The rest of the cast was well done, too, with stand out performances from Kirsten Dunst as Claudia, and Antonio Banderas as Armand.This, plus the extraordinary cinematography and musical score make this movie a 9 for me.",10,5,5,20 April 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," And now for something completely different
","This is an absolutely wonderfully silly movie. The acting is over the top, the plot is push button, and the music is overdone. The script is tongue in cheek and the special effects are cheesy.All of this add up to a completely brilliant movie that will stand up to the test of time. The Monty python group outdid themselves with this retelling of the classic Camelot story. You can tell, right from the start that they aren't taking themselves seriously, and it works!The best way to watch this is in a large group of people who have seen it enough times to know it by heart. I guarantee you a good time! It gets a 10 from me for sheer cheek!",10,0,1,21 April 2006
Born on the Fourth of July," Amazing and Powerful
","This is an unflinching look at the life of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), a Vietnam vet who became paralyzed during the war, and how he learns to live with his disability by becoming an anti-war activist.There is so much to like about this movie. Cruise plays Kovic with strength and dignity and Oliver Stone's direction is wonderful, getting the anti-war message across without turning the movie into a preach-a-thon.This movie is one that will stand up to the test of time. I know it's not supposed to be a 'happy, happy, joy, joy' type movie, but I am giving this movie an 8 out of 10 from me because it's a little difficult to watch at times.",8,3,4,16 April 2006
The Wizard of Oz," One of my fondest memories from childhood
","I can remember watching this movie every year when it came on network TV (I think it was usually around Easter time) and actually being upset if I had to miss it.  This is a fantasy/adventure, full of thinly disguised morals. 
Considering the time frame the movie was made in, the special effects are impressive (not by today's standards, but hey, it was 1938!)
They brought Frank Baum's tale to life in a very magical way.  It's a classic to me.  The dance routines are great, even if it's just skipping down the yellow brick road (yes...I admit it...I spent hours learning how to do that skip-step they do!).They should NEVER-EVER remake this...this version is perfect just the way it is!",Null,0,1,14 April 2004
