Captain Phillips," 8+2=10:-) 8 for movie,2 for Tom Hanks acting.
","This is my first review for a movie.I wrote for it because the movie was stunning and awesome.At starting i thought that it is like a simple movie and only tom hanks acting will take it to the end but soon it made me wrong.And i thought that don't judge a movie by its starting:-) Excellent movie,Suspense,Thriller. Keeps you on the EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. Acting was superb.By all actors.The acting from Tom Hanks was emotional and legendary.Story was good.Also contained small twists.for newbie actors,watch it and learn about acting. Loved it much.one of my favorite film. Recommended to everyone.WATCH IT AND LOVE IT........... sorry for language mistakes:-)",10,4,6,16 March 2014
