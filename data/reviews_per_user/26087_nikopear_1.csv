Blade Runner 2049," Amazing sequel
","I'm blown away by how great this movie was. I love how Denis minimized the focus to stay with Joe instead of being this huge story about a coup, but at the same time still offer a glimpse into the world and him being one of the key players/catalysts for what is to come. The set designs are especially impressive. I love how they kept with the original Blade Runner's color scheme but at the same time made this movie into their own.",10,1,14,22 December 2018
