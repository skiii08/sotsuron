Hereditary," So terribly horrific. A wonderful horror movie with brains.
","Smart horror. From the beginning, every word, every thing you see, is placed there for a reason. Not some artsy- interpret as a guess symbolism, but placed there intentionally. Like you need to really listen and really see and it all makes sense in the end. Or in the begining, depending on how perceptive you are. 
This is our generations 'Exorcism'. It's that good. And that messed up. But it doesn't have a happy ending. Not like The Exorcist. No.",10,8,14,7 September 2018
A Star Is Born," Maybe I have a life
","But I'm sorry, the music- the actual songs were terrible. The film was so shallow, really lacking depth In some really important parts. Trying to sell GaGa as having a large nose and too ugly to make it in the business nowadays is a hard sell- to say the least . Her pain over that also a hard sell.
The character development really lacked .. it was hard to believe in a once in a lifetime love that I couldn't see ... I mean the chemistry of these stars is off the hook. ( everyone tapping foot waiting for Bradly to get divorced and hook up with Gaga)
But the script didn't back up what we saw. The plot also didn't back up what we saw.
We are supposed to believe so many things - and it just was not there in the writing or the scenes.
As far as acting goes- I was stunned by Bradly. I mean, he steals this show in every way possible. He outshines Gaga in every single scene. He is just brimming with charisma and talent.
His direction! The direction of this film is Oscar Worthy. There are some stunning moments as far as direction is concerned.
The script is beyond terrible and so is the music.
The 70s version had like four #1s ... the music is played on the radio still today!
It would have been cool to say the same about this film.
Gaga didn't have the same kind of depth.... as Bradley here. Their characters are mismatched and in that way- the love isn't believable. For this film we needed to see a really remarkable and unique female lead with real depth, not just vanity and immaturity. We needed to believe she was worth his chasing and we don't.
Bradley got my attention so hard here though... I never thought of him as really talented or having that depth as an actor and he really changed my mind.
I wish they could have worked on other aspects of this film to make it one of the greats.
This film in ten years will be forgotten and everyone will think its sucks. It had a shine for a second - they could have made it last forever and really seized on some great opportunities to tell us something ( no pun intended)",6,1,2,8 July 2019
Bird Box," I really liked this.
","I love end of the world movies...I fantasize about the world ending. I think it would be cool if we all had something more important to think about. But having said that, there are so many bad apolcalyptic films.
This movie had characters that were interesting. I really liked the lead. Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job here making you believe her. She is really touching as a mother, and there is something so relatable about her choices. She makes sense. That's so important in these films that have really unbelievable premises to begin with.
This movie actually made me cry.
I loved that there was not such a terrible ending too. I mean everyone dies , but not everyone. And that's so rad.
I am still going to a movie to be entertained after all, and when movies don't do anything you want them to do at the end when you're so attached at that point to the characters and their outcomes- it sucks.
Like if Game of Thrones kills off Jon Snow and The mother of dragons and they don't live happily ever after raising their baby and Cersi doesn't die- I'm going to really hate the best tv series ever made. All because it ended badly.
This one is good entertainment ! And worth a watch. That's really all we can ask for in a movie. Right?",9,2,5,30 December 2018
The Favourite," I wasn't that impressed. At all.
","The most impressive line in the whole thing was 'Because love doesn't lie!'
If the question of what love is , is still a mystery, we are a sad, sad bunch.
I think the world of art was probably far more impressed with this because it was the shallow man's feeling tale. For someone arrogant , power hungry, and used to the exploits of ambition, this is probably a marvel, and self revelatory. For the rest of us, who long ago examined our need for competition and jealousy, ego and power hungry desperation- it's the lesser offering of so many delicious movies out there about the same exact thing.
Personally I didn't like how they merged modern with history .. it made it less believable and more appeasing the subject matter and really at it' end, insulting to think we couldn't sit through a movie that was actually realistic about history.
I know it was a stab at comedy but ... it just fell short. On every level.
Everyone is going on and on over the script- it makes me wonder what kind of exposure they have to literacy.
I mean with period pieces - just off the top of my head- Rob Roy, Dangerous Liaisons ( with Glen Close) they make this script remedial when we compare. Of course those movies weren't block busters - how could they be? Half the planet literally couldn't sit through them.
So, I felt it was a vapid offering of the same dish, that has been done sooo much better before.
In the end it is just another shallow story about self love and the will to survive, than love or power.
And maybe that was the entire point after all.",5,2,4,11 August 2019
The Lion King," Wow.
","So I read all the reviews about how little emotion there was in this version and I have to say- my kids ? We're entranced. They loved it. No one was thinking about how little emotion anyone had. In fact, no one was really thinking at all because my kids love the story so much.
Of course there was a lot of comparison. To the first version. Personally I am glad they copied it exactly . It was a great and pretty much perfect story for kids already. The songs are favorites to this day. The kids wanted the songs and they wanted to see the first movie alive.
This story is intense. It's a child's version of Hamlet. But if you think about it... this story is slightly traumatic to any healthy kid with normal parents. I mean my kids were shocked by the turn of events in this story and it really tethers right on the border of being too much for children emotionally. The slightest change, the near miss and this is a movie that kids can't tolerate. So for us I think we were glad they stuck with the story we all know. My kids especially. It would have been a huge surprise for them and totally disappointing if the story and songs changed.
It was pretty scary as a matter of fact for my kids. My four year old spent half the time with his eyes covered. Because for them, without the cartoon, it became so realistic and much more poignant I think. Darker.
I thought it was beautifully done.
If I had a complaint it would be -no Nathan Lane. I mean Pumba and Timba from the first movie were the best. Why would they ever attempt to replace them? So Pumba and Timba fell short for me. But other than that, I thought it was an amazing child's story that kids all over the world will love. Hopefully it will also teach them to love the animals in this movie and not grow up to hunt or kill them, and actually protect them.
Which would be a happy cconsequence.",9,1,3,13 August 2019
