The Blair Witch Project," Very good .. but a let down. Too bad.
","Looked forward with much anticipation to seeing this film.  Having seen it, I found myself glad to have gone, but not quite satisfied.  It was a most clever idea and brilliantly executed.  However (there's always one of those, huh?) didn't live up to the hype.  Perhaps this is the fault of the producers .. wanting to ensure an audience, but then unable to deliver the promised product.",7,1,1,2 August 1999
The Green Mile," The best Stephen King movie
",You can always count on Mr. King for a spellbinding novel .. not so when the novel gets adapted to the screen.  We've seen some real stinkers there! But this movie is a real treat!  I read the book (serial version) just a couple of weeks ago and was curious (and hopeful) to see what they'd done with the movie.  It was a fantastic job.,10,0,1,28 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," Is there a minimum age for an Oscar? This kid was spectacular!
","I've been waiting for this one .. and wasn't disappointed.  Mr. Willis does a fine job, but the true star of the show is young Mr. Osment.  I don't know if there is a minimum age for an Oscar, but this young man is truly deserves consideration.  One of the most convincing acting jobs I've ever seen by anyone.",10,0,0,7 August 1999
