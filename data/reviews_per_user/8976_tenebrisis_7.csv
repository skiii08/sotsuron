Black Swan," Black Swan AKA 'Let's rip off from a better film...'
","Here's the problem; it's the most predictable, routine film imaginable. Every smash cut, every horrifying vision in a mirror...it's so damn cliché, so easy to spot. 'Black Swan' raises an awful lot of tension, but nowadays, that's so easy. All it uses are the same quick cuts, focus changes, and scary images of any two-bit, throwaway horror film. The whole time I was watching the cliché fest, I was remembering a movie called 'Perfect Blue'. It has virtually the exact same premise, and it's a cheap animated movie from the late 90s, not a star-studded Hollywood $13 million picture with a score by Clint Mansell. But everything that 'Black Swan' failed at, 'Perfect Blue' succeeded in. Just do yourself a favor and watch the latter from start to finish. And you know what? It turns out that Darren Aronofsky had bought the US rights to 'Perfect Blue' to avoid getting sued for 'Black Swan'. My intuition was right. But of course, not even a word of thanks was given to Satoshi Kon, who died tragically in 2010 of cancer at the age of just 46. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156887/ (perfect blue)",5,0,2,21 May 2011
3:10 to Yuma," One of the Great Westerns
","This is testimony to how much more sophisticated films have gotten since the 50's. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe exude more energy between each other with only an intonation or without even a line in only a look, that volumes are conveyed about the relationship between these two characters. The screen writers have tweaked the script just enough to elevate a dull 50's western to a classic film about a man's need for acceptance from his son and honor for himself. A LOT of Action and surprising stunts. An edge of your seat thriller, unexpected plot and a nice twist at the ending. It has all the makings of a sequel and I'm anticipating it's arrival .. Maybe the young boy comes into play in the next one. That would be awesomeThe characters are not black and white. They are real, and have human weaknesses as well as strengths. This is not a great western. It is a great picture!",9,0,0,3 August 2013
28 Days Later...," The Real Zombification Process!
","a well-acted, well directed, and well written scary movie. Director Danny Boyle keeps the audience off-balance. Nightmarish quick cuts and digital video give the look of the movie a gritty, hallucinatory immediacy. Boyle also makes brilliant use of the empty artifacts, from the deserted London streets to a once-magnificent Gosford Park-style country house, now occupied by military, who eat rotting food around the table once used for glittering parties. Each character gets just one defining quality (idealistic Jim, tough Selena, stout-hearted Frank, ingenue Hannah), but that just adds to the sense of urgency -- we don't have time to get to know them, just as they don't have time to get to know one another....Desolate and empty London streets. An upturned bus. A solitary man's echoing 'Hello?' sends pigeons fleeing. Simple imagery, but stunningly effective.Danny Boyle can't be typed as a director. This guy is all over the board. He has a great feel for horror though, making very sure that he knows what really is scary. There is some blood, no doubt, but this isn't a spoon-fed easy horror, but more of an unseen menace. Even when the 'Infected' are (quite literally) in your face, the camera is shaky and quick cuts are used to break up what you see and blur comprehension. Boyle also knows when to rely on action and when to slow things down. He never seems to be in a hurry, and allows the audience to get to know the characters on their own. Nothing is ever over-explained here at all, and any small lapses are acceptable due to the focus.",10,1,2,17 October 2013
The Fountain," I just didn't get it!
","Not what I was expecting. My impression was that the film would be focus on adventures surrounding the search for the Fouontain Of Youth. The editing was such that I almost quit watching because the story line was bouncing around so much. I stayed with it only out of curiosity as to how the thing would end. Well one of those movies that you have to watch till the end, trying to understand what's going on, and when you finish watching it you just find out that life no matter what always ends.I just didn't get it! I got that he wanted to save her, but the bubble, That Tree , no it did nothing to keep my interest.Don't waste your time on this one.",5,1,3,3 August 2013
Mother!," horror or not?
","Pi was a great debut.But this one...? Just saw it with a very small audience of people who were totally not into it.but I definitely see why people are hating it. the bigger problem with the movie is it marketed itself as a classic horror movie. As a straightforward horror film, this already didn't work because of the final 45 minutes or so just being too out there and especially too illogical, but then in the final minute Aranofsky makes the greatest mistake of all by pulling the rug out from under the film and explain it all, thereby completely nullifying any attachment to the protagonist that was built up until that point, and making this film entirely about himself. The film is instantly turned into one big metaphor for the creative process, the breaking of the crystal (i.e. the heart of his story, i.e. the JLaw character) the moment where the writer starts to lose the plot, as his story starts to devolve further and further into a tangled mess. Crumple up the paper, and start over again.It's all very meta, and it's all very unengaging, and because of that ending, rather dull. Had he not created the bookends, we could have interesting discussions about what all the madness meant, but he took that chance away by simply explaining the film. In a deft move, I'll give him that, but now I'm left with watching a (purposefully nameless, as it turns out) protagonist for two hours that in the end I shouldn't care about, because she was just a draft version. That ending was just way too 'Get it? Get it?",5,1,3,17 September 2017
Identity," This is one of my favorite movies!
","this is a heart pounding thriller in which you never know who is the bad guy or even what is real and what is not real. This great psychological thriller will continually keep you guessing great casting as well i highly recommend it to anyone.Quick delivery. Great quality. Great movie. Lots of twists and turns all the way to the end. Love it. The darkness of the setting, coupled with intermittent thunder and the pattering of rain, create an all-encompassing sense of suspense bordering on fear. Rain muffles sound, so how can you hear if someone's sneaking up behind you? Identity is a unique and original film most movie lovers will enjoy. The plot device is employed with the utmost efficiency, keeping the audience guessing until the very end. Who is the real killer? You'll have to watch Identity to find out...I can't say more without spoilers, and this one shouldn't be spoiled. anyway,If you like horror movies, psychological thrillers or just original movies, you MUST watch 'Identity'.",9,1,2,8 April 2013
Munich," One of the best...!!!
","This was by far one of the best films of 2005 and ranks right up there with Spielberg's Private Ryan and Schindler's List. However, I believe that Spielberg spoiled the film by choosing the World Trade Center as the background of the final scene. What was the message of that shot supposed to be? Since America did not do enough to stop terrorism that we ended up paying an enormous price for our lack of effort? Was it supposed to be some ironic forbearance of the future? Up until that shot I was enthralled by Munich, but I left the theater angry about the final scene. Many 'unknowns' were answered in the movie Munich. An eye opening drama.It's a very good story, and Steven Spielberg surely did a good job in this movie. this is a great film that shows the never ending battle of Religion. you can kill one person but they will breed more people so in the end it is a never ending battle.",9,1,2,8 April 2013
