Angels & Demons," Agree with comments
","I read many of the comments on this website before posting my own. Needless to say, many of the comments were extremely accurate. Many have read all or some of Dan Brown's work, and are able to sequence the book and the movie in it's entirety.I have none of that, I only have one observation, technical in nature. While I am a fan of the willing suspense of disbelief, I am a bigger fan of logic. And when movies omit technology (either because of the time period, or despite it), I am more at ease. When films embrace technology, there are always one of two outcomes. They either do it correctly or incorrectly. This movie does it incorrectly, and to the peril of the entire main plot!!! When Hasassin, the villain, steals a wireless camera and moves it more than 2 miles away, it can only be one type of wireless camera. One that uses CMDA, TDMA, GSM or some other standard broadband technology. It would also need to broadcast pretty strongly (about as strong as a common cellphone). Therefore, the signal could then be traced and the ENTIRE PLOT CAN BE AVOIDED. Think about that.We're talking about the Vatican, the catholic church. They have more money and access to the type of security that belongs in the movies. They can't trace a simple TDMA signal? They have to hire an archnemesis in Robert Langdon and then have him solve 16th century puzzles on a running stopwatch? PLEASE I don't know if this stolen wireless camera was as much part of the plot in the book as it is in the movie, where they are trying to cut power to parts of the city to see when the camera loses light etc, but if it is, I couldn't read the book either. Dan Brown, either embrace technology in your books (and their very simple concepts) or start writing books set in medieval times. I am willing to suspend my disbelief and believe that there is a heaven in the sky, and that Moses can part the Red Sea, but I will simply not believe the Vatican cannot trace a cellphone signal in the year 2008.",Null,1,2,31 December 2009
