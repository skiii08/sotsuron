Hereditary," A startlingly fabulous horror film which almost defines it's own genre.
","I won't discuss the plot, you've read enough about it already, or can easily access it. 
I've long been a fan of Toni Collette, I think for a long while she was most underrated and it's only lately people are becoming to realise what a fine actress she is. 
However she excels herself in this film and it shows what can be achieved with a good story, a great actress and an excellent director. 
One of my all time fave horrors and I'll definitely be looking out for more Ali Aster.",9,7,12,27 August 2018
Green Room," Sorry, B movie if ever there was one.
","I'm flabbergasted with some of the reviews on here, and especially when someone stated that Patrick Stewart had said he had to set his security before he went to bed as the film was that horrific. I think that's marketing because it's not the horrific at all. It's utterly unrealistic in terms of plat, scenes, injuries, peoples' actions and overall story. The violence is just violence porn and not tense or horrifying. Think Saw on a lesser budget. The acting is appalling but I think that's partly because the dialogue is so bad and the scenes so ridiculous that it's difficult to consider the acting alone. I am amazed Anton Yelchin and Patrick Stewart put their names to this: they've both gone down in my estimation. Patrick Stewart's performance isn't that good anyway. If you're a Star Trek fan don't watch this because it will ruin the captain's persona forever.Imogen Poots gets worse with every movie she does. I think the problem is in the movies she chooses, they're usually bad choices. As far as B movies goes this isn't too bad although I have seen better B movies. If you're utterly bored and have nothing better to do with 90 minutes watch it if only to see how awful it is. If you like movies, don't waste your time at all, it really isn't worth 90 minutes.",3,63,120,10 July 2016
Youth," If you like pretentious, boring movies that try to be something without knowing what they want to be...this is perfect for you.
","Like many I suspect I watched this movie because of Michael Caine, Rachel Weisz and Paul Dano. Harvey Keitel is an utterly flat actor and he performs his flatness perfectly in this drivel. Jane Fonda has never been very good but her small role is actually quite good and the dialogue from her one scene could indeed be about her. The cinematography is brilliant and you know you're in Switzerland before it's ever mentioned. However it's the only thing about the film that's any good. There are plenty of scenes which defy explanation, there are lots of scenes which are simply daft, and a many which are simply boring and slow. The dialogue is enough to make you want to slit your wrists and wonder how this kind of stuff ever gets financed. In my personal opinion I suspect it got financed as a vehicle to the main actors retirement pay: I'm guessing they called in some favours to get it made. It will never become a classic, you'll probably not watch until the end let alone watch it twice, and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't demand their money back if they saw it at the cinema. Pointless, long, boring, mostly badly acted, terribly scripted, without one single solitary uplifting thing. I only gave it two stars for Paul Dano and the nude scenes.",2,12,21,10 December 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Fabulous film, with some terrible moments.
","I've not rated this film s high as some because I think there's some major flaws in it. The acting from McDormand is fabulous, possibly her best since Fargo. Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell pull out all the stops.
Clarke Peters sadly is like a blast from an 80's TV cop movie but that's not bad, it's just out of place slightly. 
However what really put me off was Abbie Cornish. She's a long way away from being a good actress let alone a great one, and to match her youth with Woody's when he is more than 20 years her senior harks back to bad old days of old men matched with young women. It was unnecessary and if they wanted glamour they could have easily cast someone like Michelle Pfeiffer. 
I didn't know she was in the film so when I saw her and the character she was playing it was very out of place. 
Then we get to a uniquely moving and romantic piece in the film where Woody's character has made love to her for the last time as he has terminal cancer. Reliving that moment Cornish's character as his wife says 'Thanks for that wonderful fuck.' 
WHAT??? One of the most poignant moments in the film and they reduce it to a fuck??? She then goes on to say how beautiful his cock is!
Utterly ruined the moment for me and degraded what is otherwise a fabulous, tremendous movie. What were the editors thinking!?",7,3,5,3 March 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Not really that good, especially for the length of it.
","Well I was told before I watched this that it was a great movie. Not sure why anyone would call it that, it's anything but great. In fact I was bored during watching it and kept going to FB to see if there was anything interesting there to keep me awake.The first mistake it makes is to cast Eddie Redmayne. I think he's one of the most over rated actors and constantly looks as if his mouth was frozen while saying 'Pork'. This means it's often difficult to understand what he's saying and I get tired of fighting to hear dialogue.Effects are OK. sets great, dialogue poor, acting mostly average, direction average and ability to captivate very low. I will definitely not be checking out the rest of the movies in the pipeline and I wish I could reclaim the hours I wasted watching this.",4,3,5,29 January 2017
Arrival," A lovely film which might only attract sci fi fans, but it has drawbacks
","I loved Amy Adams, and she did not overact as she often does, she played this one to perfection. However, call me dumb but I gave this a 5 which is a big break from most people reviewing the film. Why? Well firstly, once again, no matter how lovely the soundtrack, it should NEVER drown out or distract from the dialogue, yet in this movie it did several times. The dialogue and the pictures are what carry the story and if you miss what they're saying you miss part of the story. It's become de rigeur for directors to supposedly enhance their films recently with great scores, but this trend of drowning out dialogue needs to stop because it is spoiling films. Secondly, although a great story might always leave something to you to figure out, it should never leave out too much. For me Arrival left out quite a lot to the point that at first watching I have no idea of the timeline of the story. Did she have and lose her child before this alien occurrence? Did she have and lose her child after it? If she lost it afterwards she must have been seeing into the future when she was reflecting on times with her daughter during the same period she was helping to decode the aliens' language. What? I'm left with feeling there were great parts of the story, with some great cinematography, and some excellent score, but the overall experience was ruined for me by the odd parts of the story that didn't make sense, and the drowning out of dialogue by violins. This could have been a great film, but wasn't.",5,0,7,1 February 2017
Wonder Woman," Very poor and not at all what I was expecting
","An interesting introduction, followed by a tedious post into that lasted over and hour. Then the most ridiculous couple of showdowns I've seen. 
David Thewlis as a mustachioed God of War? Really. Who made that decision?
So much boring and monochrome dialogue that was supposed to be deep maybe, but turned out to be slow and tedious. David Thewlis' delivery was absolutely laughable at the end.
Granted, in a sexist world the best thing about this film is Gal Gadot in a skimpy outfit and let's face it that's why they chose her. But $150 million to make a film? That's truly insane. I can't even see how it's possibly to spend that sum of money for what we saw. 
Absolute load of rubbish.",2,1,7,13 January 2018
Midway," Like a lot of over hyped films, this one was over hyped.
","This film had been built up in my mind from trailers, interviews online and by friends who had gone to see it at the cinema.
By the time I got to see it I was expecting too much, but had I been expecting just a great film, I was sorely disappointed.
The first thing was the acting. Dennis Quid is always great and he was here, as was Woody Harrelson who is always flawless. Aaron Eckhart and Patrick Wilson could be said to be very good, although Wilson sometimes appeared not to know what he was doing.
The plot was fabulous. I've read the book and seen 2 films so far about that famous battle and this was probably in the middle of the other two films. Cinematography was sub par considering the budget of over a tenth of a Billion dollars. When you've got CGI your camera angles and views and effects are limited only by your imagination, and clearly the cinematographer/CGI artist had none. It failed to impress and sometimes I think the effects were the point of certain scenes rather than the life and death bravery shown by the actors. (Playing real people)
The home view, showing wives and children was pathetic. I was never once made to feel any empathy at all for the partners left behind and the kids who might soon be fatherless. They got plenty of air time, it just wasn't very well acted or directed.
All in all I think the director did a pretty sloppy job all round and considering the colossal budget he had for this there really was no excuse at all. A great shame such a big film can only scrape 5 from me, and I think I am being generous with 5.",5,2,7,7 February 2020
