Antz," This and A Bug's Life are the best animated features of 1998.
",I remember and going and seeing ANTZ back in October of 1998 and I absolutely loved it! This and its competitor A Bug's Life are the best animated features of 1998. In the movie Z a worker ant meets Bala a princess in a bar and falls in love. He asks his buddy Weaver the soldier ant to switch places with him! Then Z goes off and fights some termites and then returns to colony and meets up with Princess Bala and then takes her on an adventure to Insectopia where ants can be free but Z and Bala know they must return to the colony to stop evil General Mandible who's planning to rule the colony! Filled with hilarious scenes and funney characters Antz like A Bug's Life is the perfect film for the whole family! DREAMWORKS SKG and PIXAR have done well with their two competitive films of 1998. 10 out of 10!,10,0,1,19 May 2009
Beauty and the Beast," Tale as Old as Time It Never Gets old.
","Beauty and the Beast in my opinion never gets old! It's always young and magical. I love the characters, animation, music, and story. In the story a Prince gets transformed into a Beast for being selfish towards an enchantress disguised as an old woman. He later falls in love with a girl named Belle who he takes prisoner. His whole household who have also turned into objects from the enchantress also like her hoping that she falls in love with the Beast to break the spell and be human again. My favorite scene in the movie is towards the end when Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) and Cogsworth (David Ogden Siters)argue over who told who that Belle was gonna break the spell. That was funney. I also liked when Gaston told Belle that his little wife (Belle) was going to massage his feet while the little ones (Strapping Boys) played on the floor with the dogs. That was hilarious. Gaston in my opinion was one of the greatest animated villains ever because he's got a lot of comic in him. Filled with great animation, story, characters, and music written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who sadly died of Aids before the film's release) Beauty and the Beast is an animated feature that'll go on forever and ever. I'm glad it's the only animated feature to win an award for Best Picture because I think it really deserved that and I think Walt Disney himself would of been very proud to know of that award. 10 out of 10.",10,5,6,3 June 2009
Finding Nemo," Pixar has done well this underwater sea adventure!
","Finding Nemo is one of the most wonderful films Pixar has made! When Nemo the clown fish gets kidnapped by a dentist scoobadiver his overprotective father Marlin searches for him with the help of the forgetful blue tang Dory! Along the way they meet new friends and Marlin learns a lesson about being a father! My favorite character was Dory Crush and Bruce! They all are funney! My favorite scenes are when the submarine that Bruce and his friends were hanging out in blew up and the two pelicans sitting on top of the surface see the bubbles from the explosion and one of them thinks the other let off gas and says NICE! I also liked it when Nemo, Tad, Pearl, and Sheldon are out looking at the water and Tad pulls Pearl back letting off her ink and she says You guys made me ink! That was hilarious! Filled with wonderful underwater animation, characters, and story Finding Nemo is a true PIXAR classic that'll go on forever! 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,17 May 2009
Home Alone," A great family film!
",Home Alone is a great family film that is pretty funney! In the movie Kevin McCallister(Macauly Culkin) hates being the youngest member of his big family! On the night before his family plans to take holiday trip to Paris Kevin gets in trouble and is sent to the third floor. While there Kevin wishes for his family to disappear and in the morning gets his wish as his family leaves in a hurry to get to the airport and leaves Kevin home alone! Kevin enjoys being home alone but soon feels bad for the way he acted towards them and misses them! He also learns that two burglars named Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are planning to break into his home and that he must defend his house with traps for the burglars! My favorite scene in the movie is where Harry and Marv finally meet each other in the house after walking through several of Kevin's traps and Harry asks Marv Why the hell ya take your shoes off? And Marv asks Harry Why the hell ya dressed like a chicken? I just died laughing at that scene! Filled with wonderful laughter and humor Home Alone is a true family movie that the whole family can enjoy! I laugh every time I see it! 10 out of 10!,10,1,3,27 July 2009
Megamind," Dreamworks Worst.
",I bought Megamind at WAL-MART and I must say that I didn't like it. I personally think that it's the worst animated movie that Dreamworks has made. The plot was kinda weird the villain wants to take over the world but then turns good after falling in love with a girl. The characters weren't very funny and the animation wasn't great. All in all I believe that this is just a rip off of The Incredibles and I don't think that Dreamworks should of ever made this movie! It's definitely their worst! It's nowhere as good as Shrek or Madagascar. So if you're a fan of Dreamworks I suggest that you don't see this movie because you won't like it and you'll just be wasting your money. Thumbs down for me.,1,3,34,26 March 2011
Forrest Gump," Mama always said life is a box of chocolates you never know what your gonna get, You might get a good classic.
",I've always liked the movie Forrest Gump ever since I was a little kid. It's a real classic and Tom Hanks just does a fantastic job as Forrest Gump. In the movie a man named Forrest Gump while waiting for a bus in Savannah Georgia tells his life story of growing up in Greenbow Alabama and playing football for the University of Alabama and then going into the army and fighting in Vietnam and then starting his own successful shrimping business and then fighting for the love of his life Jenny Curren and running across America. My favorite character in the movie was Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise)and I liked it when he asked Forrest if he found Jesus and Forrest said I didn't know I was suppose to be looking for him sir! That was so hilarious that I almost died laughing! Forrest Gump is a true classic movie that'll go on forever and ever! It's my favorite Tom Hanks film along with Cast Away! 10 out of 10!,10,1,4,8 June 2009
"Monsters, Inc."," Monsters a great story!
","Monsters Inc thee fourth animated movie from Pixar I thought was an hilarious film! I loved the idea of monsters having the job to scare kids through their doors in a factory and then all of a sudden a little girl gets loose in their world! That was hilarious! My favorite character was Roz. I loved how she was pestering Mike about turning in his paperwork and then at the end being the Number 1 CDA Agent and she didn't wanna see any paperwork on the incident with Boo! That was hilarious! I also liked Randall Boggs and I think he's my favorite Pixar Villain along with Hopper and Syndrome. I loved how he could make himself invisible and I liked how he got banished to that trailer and got beaten up mistaken for a gator! That was hilarious! Filled with wonderful characters, great animation, and a great story Monsters Inc is a true classic that'll go on forever and ever! Good job again Pixar!",10,1,2,27 January 2009
Ratatouille," Brad Bird has done it again!
","Brad Bird the director of The Iron Giant and The Incredibles has done it again! This time with Ratatouille! In the movie Remy the Rat (Patton Oswelt' wants to become a chef just like his hero Gusteau (Brad Garret). When he gets separated from his family Remy winds up in Paris and goes to Gusteau's restaurant and meets Linguini (Lou Romano) the garbage boy!

Filled with wonderful animation, great story, and great characters Ratatouille is a wonderful film the whole family can enjoy! Pixar has proved again they can do no wrong! Brad Bird has done good with this one just like he did with The Iron Giant and The Incredibles. Good job Brad Bird! 10 out of 10!",10,1,2,30 June 2009
The Little Mermaid," My favorite Disney movie even though I'm a boy
","I love The Little Mermaid. It happens to be my favorite Disney movie even though I'm a boy in 11th grade. I love the characters. My favorite being Scuttle the forgetful but funney Seaqull. I loved it when he sticked the fork thinking it was a dingle hopper into his hair and it made his hair stick up! I also liked it when he tried to sing during Kiss the Girl song but his singing sounded awful! Those were both hilarious scenes! John Musker and Ron Clements were smart to cast comedian Buddy Hackett in that role! I'm also a fan of Ursula the seawitch because I think she looks like my Aunt Pat. The one scene where I see my aunt as Ursula is when Ursula says to Ariel You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate the importance of body language! That's where I say that's definitely my Aunt Pat! I also like the songs written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. I love Part of Your World. It's probably the best song in the movie! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, songs, and story Little Mermaid in my opinion is the best Disney movie ever! It will always be my favorite even though I'm a boy. I'm sure Walt would of liked it if he could of seen it! He'd probably call it the Snow White of the 1980s. 10/10.",10,4,6,28 April 2009
The Incredibles," Mr Incredible is better than Superman and Batman
","When I first saw The Incredibles when it came out I knew I was going to like it. Being a big fan of comic books and superheroes I loved it! Brad Bird was good to choice PIXAR to do this project than Warner Bros who did his 2D Animated Feature The Iron Giant which was also good. I loved it in the movie when Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) was yelling at his wife to tell him where his superhero suit was! That was hilarious! I also liked it when Dash's teacher Bernie tries to prove Dash guilty of doing something wrong on tape but the tape can't prove it! That was hilarious too! Filled with wonderful characters, voice actors, animation, and good story Incredibles is the best superheroes movie ever! Better than Superman and Batman! Brad Bird you and the folks at Pixar did a fantastic job with this project! Keep up the good work PIXAR and Brad Bird!",10,0,0,17 February 2009
A Bug's Life," Pixar's second feature
","When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a good feature! I was right! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could hate a Pixar film! I think they're all pretty good films! Good job PIXAR!",10,2,2,26 January 2009
Toy Story," Toy Story was like the Snow White of 1995
","I remember going and seeing Toy Story when I was 5 years old at the movies. I fell completely in love with it! It had great animation, great characters and a great story! My favorite character was the Slinky Dog played by my favorite comedian the late Jim Varney (God rest his soul). I loved it towards the end when Slinky is trying to get Woody and Buzz into the moving van and the others toys in the moving van pull on him so hard that he begins to stretch out! That was hilarious! I also liked it when Slinky says Come on PotatoHead! If Woody says it's all right well darn it it's good enough for me! Woody has never stared us wrong before! With Toy Story PIXAR showed us what Computer Animation could do to tell a great story! Toy Story like Snow White it an animated classic that'll go on forever! I'm hoping one day to get a job at PIXAR and I think Walt Disney would of been proud of what they've done with Toy Story and Computer Animation. God bless you Pixar Animation Studios!",10,0,0,26 January 2009
Toy Story 2," Great animated sequel EVER!
","When I first saw the trailer for Toy Story 2 it looked good but I didn't think it was gonna be as good as the original. When I saw it in Thanksgiving 1999 I realized how wrong I was! I loved just as much as the original maybe even more! I loved the new characters Jessie, Bullseye, Stinkey Pete the Prospector, Al the toy collector, Wheezy, Zurg, and last but not least Tour Guide Barbie! My favorite scenes were when Andy's Toys were walking to Al's Toy Barn and Hamm's courke falls out and he's like All right! Nobody look TTL I get my courke back in! I also liked it when the Tour Guide Barbie jumps into the car with the toys and flurts with Mr.PotatoHead and Mr. PotatoHead says I'm a married spud! I'm a married spud! And Hamm pushes him aside so he can sit next to Tour Guide Barbie saying Then Make Room for the singles fellas! And last but not least I liked it when they're in the airport and Slinky gets caught by another suitcase and he's screaming Buzz! Buzz! My bands going to end route! Those were the funniest scenes! Filled with hilarious scenes, great animation, great follow up story, and great new characters! Toy Story 2 is the best sequel ever made! Most sequels should be like this! Thank you PIXAR!",10,0,1,27 January 2009
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," A great sequel!
",I think Home Alone 2 Lost in New York is a great sequel to the first Home Alone movie! In this sequel Kevin McCallister is planning to go on a trip to Miami Florida with his family but accidentally gets separated from them at the airport and accidentally gets on a plane to New York City. Once in NYC Kevin checks himself into the Plaza Hotel but the next day his father's credit card is discovered stolen by the Concear (Tim Curry) who scares Kevin away from the hotel! Upon escaping the hotel Kevin learns that the burglars who broke into his house Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) have broken out of jail and are planning to rob the toy story owned by Mr. Duncan (Eddie Bracken) who Kevin visited before getting scared away from the hotel and who gave Kevin two turtle doves!

Up," Pixar has done it again. With number 10.
","I went tonight to see Up and I must say it was pretty good and pretty funny. Pixar has proved again that they can do no wrong. Thid one is just as good as the others Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, Wall-e and now this one Up. In the movie this man named Carl and his wife love to go on adventure and then his wife dies and he is asked to go and live a retirement but instead he decides to put balloons on top of his house and sail to South America where he and his wife wanted to go before he died. As he starts to float up a kid named Russell who is a wilderness explorer is on his house and decides to join him! Along the way they meet a female bird named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug. My favorite character was Dug the dog voiced by Pixar story man Bob Peterson. Filled with hilarious scenes, characters, and beautiful animation Up is a true movie that any Pixar fan should see. I'm hoping to get a job at Pixar as soon as I complete High School next year. I can't wait to see what they've got planned for the future. Way to go Pixar. 10 out of 10.",10,3,9,29 May 2009
Pretty Woman," Great Movie
",I've watched the movie Pretty Woman many times and must say it's a pretty good movie. Richard Gere gives a good performance as a business man named Edward Lewis who hires a prostitute named Vivian Ward to stay the week with him at his hotel for the week while he's on business. Julia Roberts I thought gave an excellent performance as Vivian and I don't think any other actress could of done it better. The rest of the cast gave good performances I thought such as Jason Alexander playing Edward's lawyer Phil and Hector Elizondo did an excellent job playing the hotel manager Barney Thompson. I also thought that the late Ralph Bellamy gave a good performance as the role of James Morse who is the owner of the company who Edward is trying to buy. The film also has very funny scenes and jokes in it one of my favorites being when Vivian's friend Kit De Luca played by Laura San Giacomo makes a comment to an old couple in the hotel. All in all the film is a great comedy fairy tale that'll be one the whole world will enjoy again and again. 10 out of 10.,10,6,12,9 February 2011
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Walt Disney was a genius when when he showed us this movie
","Being a big fan of animation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of my favorites. Being Walt's first film and the first animated film it should be any animated film lovers favorite movie. I love it in the movie when Sneezy sneezes and it causes the dwarfs to go flying like a Hurricane wind and Grumpy says You crazy fool! By time you you pick to sneeze! I also liked Doc and his spoonerisms like when they arrive back at their house from the mines and Doc says Look! Our house the lits light uh the lights lit. That was hilarious! Filled with wonderful characters, music, story, comedy, and animation Snow White is a true animation treasure that no matter how old Snow White is as she's turning 72 years old this year she'll always be the fairest of them all! Walt Disney was a genius when he made Snow White in 1937. He deserved the award given to him by Shirley Temple in 1938 for the movie. God bless you Walt Disney and thank you for showing us what animation can do when you tell a wonderful and great story. Snow White will always be the fairest of them all!",10,4,4,28 April 2009
Toy Story 3," I love it.
","I loved Toy Story 3. It was really great. It lives up to the first 2 movies. In this adventure Woody and the gang wind up in a preschool after their owner Andy leaves for college. I loved the new characters including Stretch the purple octopus voiced by Whoopi Goldberg. The plot was pretty good, the characters were great, and the animation was so beautiful it just blows you away. The only thing that I was disappointed about was replacing Jim Varney with Blake Clark which I don't think Pixar should of done. They should of written Slinky Dog out but that's just my opinion. All in all Toy Story 3 was really great and lives up to the first two films. I recommend it for anyone. 10/10. Good job again Pixar.",10,1,1,26 August 2010
Pocahontas," Great animation film based on History
","I loved Pocahontas and I thought it was a great animated film based on history of the real Indian Pocahontas! In the movie Captain John Smith (Mel Gibson) sails to the New World of Jamestown Virginia with a group of settlers and falls in love with Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) but the settlers led by Govenor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) and the Native Americans led by Pocahontas' father Chief Powatahn (Russell Means) wish to fight each other to protect eachothers' land so it's up to Pocahontas and her forest friends Meeko, Grandmother Willow, and Flit and John Smith and his dog Percy to bring peace between their people! The music is very wonderful written by Alan Menken and Steven Schwartz. Colors of the WInd always blows me away every time I hear Pocahontas sing it! My favorite scenes in the movie were when Meeko jumps into Percy's bath and eats all his cherries and Percy chases him and I also liked it when settlers Ben and Lon (Billy Connolly and Joe Baker) come into the forest looking for Smith and get scared away by Grandmother Willow. I just died laughing at those scenes! Disney did a fantastic job telling the story of Pocahontas through animation! If they ever decide to do another animated film based on history they should do one on Christopher Columbus. Pocahontas is a true Disney film that any Disney fan can enjoy! I know I've really enjoyed it! 10 out of 10!",10,4,8,13 August 2009
