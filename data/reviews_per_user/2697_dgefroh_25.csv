The Expendables 2," Expendable 2 very expendable
","Typically I think it would be safe to say that if you put together several of the top action movie stars in an action movie you'd not only draw a lot of viewers, but you might start a series of Expendable movies that could conceivably stretch out for years. I'm guessing that was the plan when this was conceived, but they forgot that a story should also be part of the plan, not just shoot em up, punch-em out, kick their butt action with absolutely no story to hang their white hats on. This 2nd attempt to bring these super tough guys together fails miserably as a movie, yes there is plenty of action, stunts, and killing, in fact I'd guess that over 200 kills alone in this last pathetic attempt to entertain. Here's the bottom line on this film, if all you are interested in is seeing these stars kick butt, this one is exactly what you want and need. However, if you would like to see a story with a plot, with a meaningful storyline to make the violence and multiple killing sprees have some bearing, forget about this movie and hope a sequel is NOT in the offing.",3,1,2,23 November 2012
Skyfall," Skyfall falls somewhat flat for me
","James Bond films are always great action movies, regardless of what actor is playing Bond, the movies are always fun and entertaining for the viewers. In this respect, Skyfall delivers, it's as good as any and all of the Bond movies, so if that is what brings you to the theater then you will not be disappointed. In the latest effort, there is plenty of action, special effects, situations only James Bonds could escape from, and tons of edge of your seat chase scenes. In the end to me, it just seems it goes on too long, I found that the drama and anticipation of doom and dread became weary, and in truth I was waiting for it all to end. The acting was excellent, the storyline was decent, the action suburb, and the special effects were truly outstanding. Those elements earn this a 7 out of 10, but sometimes a little less may actually be better.",7,3,8,23 November 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," So bad words cannot begin to explain
","OK, I get that this is suppose to a fictional movie and that huge literary license had to be used to try and make this a movie, but that being said let me warn you that this mindless junk doesn't even begin to come close to anything anyone could call entertainment. Hey I like vampire movies, who doesn't like a scary eerie movie every now and then, but this stupid effort not only doesn't scare you to death it bores you to death. The acting is terrible, the writing is pathetic, the directing is juvenile, and the production sets are laughable. But wait, you ask what about the special effects? Well, if watching a toy train run around on the tracks entertains you, then maybe this movie is for you after all. Let me end by saying life is way to short to waste your time on this truly miserable movie, save your time and save your money for something much more fun like root canal surgery which would of been way better than wasting time on this hunk of junk.",1,3,11,18 October 2012
The Impossible," The impossible is impossible to forget
","What a movie!! The scope and depth this exceptional movie undertakes in the wake of one of the worst natural disasters ever is nothing less than brilliant. To say I enjoyed this movie is like saying you enjoyed 'Schindlers list', the total tragedy and human despair brought to life in this fantastic movie leaves a permanent imprint on your mind and soul. While this movie is so very hard to watch, you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. This is an emotional roller coaster ride with an incredible cast lead by Naomi Watts in what can only be described as not only Oscar worthy, but in my humble yet accurate opinion the very best lead actress role of the nominated actresses. Her portrayal is simply stunning, and for her not to have won the Oscar is a complete farce, her fine performance is just heads and shoulders above Jennifer Lawrence. The bottom-line....this movie is emotionally draining, and one of the best movies you'll ever watch.",10,0,0,6 March 2013
Argo," Do go to ARGO
","WOW!! What a movie, talk about sitting on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, and wiggling your feet despite the fact that you know the outcome and how this event will all end. This movie is true movie making magic from the very start. The acting is exceptional, and the production and direction is truly outstanding. By now you know the premise of this story, but until you see how it all unfolded, you really don't know anything. Until this movie, I had never been in a theater where the audience actually claps at the conclusion. This one brings out several emotions as you view and a overwhelming sense of patriotism is just one that you will experience.Ben Affleck shows he is a class director, Oscar worthy for sure. The entire cast is so believable and engaging, especially Bryan Cranston who again shows great and exceptional skill in role development.I loved this movie, you will too. One of the very best for 2012 and even maybe for years to come. Watch and enjoy!!",10,11,23,6 November 2012
Ted," A few good moments but not enough
","The concept is stupid, the jokes seem forced and vulgar, the acting is weak at best, the characters are predictable and never connect with the viewers so why watch this movie you ask? That's a tough question to answer but the truth is there were some quite humorous moments, some really funny scenes, some very funny one liners and joke sequences, and therefore I'd say the movie was worth viewing just for those few selected moments. Overall this one was just a so-so effort. I think it also could of been somewhat shorter in length as the funny lost its way and at times really dragged. I'm a big Mark Wahlberg fan, and while this isn't an example of his best work, it is still funny enough, and clever enough to earn a 5 out of 10 rating.",5,6,11,7 November 2012
Begin Again," Movie is OK, soundtrack is GREAT!!
","I love good musical movies, and like the idea of a star being given the chance to be a star storyline. This type of movie has been done countless times, most often they seem to fail and fail miserably. This one has a lot of redeeming features, namely the soundtrack. To say the music is good is an understatement, and if you are trying to decide if this movie deserves your time or money, it does but mostly for the music.It's really obvious that Keira Knightly can't play the guitar, she can carry a tune through, as her singing is decent. In fact all the actors hired to pretend to be musician are just that, actors, not musicians. Mark Ruffalo's daughter in the movie can't even hold a guitar pic right, all of which makes this disturbing, why couldn't the producers/directors at least hire musicians to play musicians? Wouldn't that add some authenticity to their movie? With all that said, if you can look beyond what I previously said, this is an enjoyable movie. It's very predictable, the acting is very weak, the storyline is equally weak, but it is a feel good enjoyable, life is good type light-weight movie that I recommend, mostly because of the exceptional supporting soundtrack.",7,1,3,4 November 2014
Life of Pi," Life of Pi is a wonderful journey
","If you are paging through reviews trying to determine if this film is worthy of your time, effort, and money, let me cut to the chase for you....YES! YES! YES! This is a very unique movie, unlike any you may have seen before. The acting is brilliant, the storyline is compelling, the cinematography breath taking, and the adventure is spellbinding. If that sounds like a fun time at the movies, then this one is for you.I had the good fortune to see this movie in 3D, I'm sure it is good without the 3D effect, but if you have a choice, try 3D as the special effects are nothing less than mind blowing.I loved this one, time seemed to fly by and I didn't want this adventure to end, I'd say that is the true test of a great film.....enjoy!!",10,4,8,28 November 2012
Interstellar," Interstellar not so stellar
","If you are looking for lots of special effects, over-bearing musical score, muddled storyline, and a way to waste 3 hours of your life this movie is for you, but NOT for me. What a huge disappointment this one turned out to be, of course what should I expect from Christopher Nolan after 'Inception'. The concept which could of been terrific was completely and totally lost by focusing way to much on the technical aspects and special effects, leaving what could of been a decent storyline line behind in an effort to explain the complexities of traveling through a space wormhole. That would be good information if you plan on being an astronaut, but if you are just a movie goer, forget-bout-it. IMDb rating for this bore-fest waste of time is way over-blown and extremely misleading. Most movie goers want to be entertained, and space travel is the final frontier and would be a great backdrop for excitement and wonder...i.e. 'Gravity'. Interstellar fails to deliver anything in the way of excitement, suspense, or drama. Yes, the acting is very good by all cast members, but most movie goers want more than stellar acting, they want a story that you can follow, they want to be entertained, and they want whatever time they spend watching a movie to be worthwhile. In this case the movies fails in all counts.",4,3,6,15 November 2014
21 Jump Street," Not funny but it is stupid and boring
","I'm giving my opinion about this movie from a grown adult perspective, so maybe through my eyes I have a slanted opinion when viewing movies such as this. That being said, I'd have to say that if you are over the age of 18, this so called comedy movie is not for you, if you are under the age of 18, maybe there is something in this you might find entertaining. If dumb, stupid, mindless comedy so predictable a grade school child could of written better sounds like fun to you, then by all means watch this movie. For the rest of us who want something more, I suggest you keep looking for something else. Let's face it, good comedy is difficult because what one person finds funny another may not. If you want funny, try 'Bridesmaids', and/or 'Horrible Bosses', these are examples of movies that will make you laugh, 21 Jump Street will make you sleep.",3,7,15,11 November 2012
Trouble with the Curve," Trouble with the curve needs some straightening out
","I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan, and I really like Amy Adams. Justin Timberlake was decent and a likable guy in this movie, so what's the problem? The problem is the story or should I say lack of a decent story. This movie is so predictable that 10 minutes into it you will be able to figure everything out including the ending. I don't understand why Clint Eastwood would accept or take on this role, maybe it's because he gets to be the crabby, hard headed, cigar smoking, never smiling, snarling old timer like he has played so well in previous good movies such as Gran Torino, Million dollar baby, and The unforgiven. Regardless of why he is in this predictable, silly waste of time, the bottom line is that this movie fails in every aspect. This is not a baseball movie, it's not a drama, it's not a romantic comedy, it's truly a waste of what might have been, could of been, or should of been a potential excellent trip into movie magic. I didn't hate this one, but I didn't like it either, I suspect the reason I didn't hate it is because I really do like Clint Eastwood movies and I'll forgive him this one slip.",5,31,49,11 December 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Silver linings is 'GOLDEN'
","This movie is getting a whole lot of buzz with nominations from both the Golden Globe and the Oscars. With that powerhouse backing most movie goers will trust that this is indeed a decent movie, and they would be right, except it is more than just decent. Look, I'm not much of a romantic comedy guy, Jennifer Aniston and and Kate Hudson have pretty much ruined that genre for years to come, but then comes along this masterful tidbit. This movie has all the right ingredients to bring romantic comedies back from the dead. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are truly exceptional in their respective roles as is Robert De Niro and for that matter the entire cast. Also the storyline is original and at the same time intriguing, a rare combination in 99% of all romantic comedies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and think it may be one of the best in this genre in the past several years. If you watch movies strictly for the entertainment value, this one will deliver, if you watch for great acting portrayals this one will deliver. Do yourself a favor and see what all the buzz is about.",9,1,4,15 January 2013
Now You See Me," Now you see me but I wish I hadn't.......ugh!!
","When I see that IMDb site has this movie rated fairly high I'm seriously wondering just what am I missing with this film. Let me start by saying what I missed was a creditable storyline, good acting, drama, romance, action, and virtually any element that could make this movie even somewhat enjoyable. What you get should you decide to waste your time, money, and brain cells watching this trite is long boring journey into a muddled inconceivable yarn about 4 magicians who thanks entirely to camera special effects bring the magic industry to tears. Every magic act is simply crap to be polite. The line up of actors who tied their wagon to this insipid hunk of junk is quite impressive, but don't be misled, they obviously did this movie strictly for the money as there is no artistic value anywhere to be found in this pitiful attempt at movie entertainment. With this movie the magic is gone....stay away!!",2,10,16,1 September 2013
Django Unchained," Django unchains a great movie
","Wow, everything I had heard and seen regarding this outstanding movie had me convinced that this was going to be a goodie, but even with high expectations, this movie was a journey that any true movie lover MUST take. Let me say up front that I love westerns, always have, always will and in my humble but accurate opinion, there hasn't been a truly great western made in a very long time. Well the spell is broken and Django unchained is setting the bar pretty darn high for any wanna-bees to follow. Quentin Tarantino shows why he is considered one of the best writers/directors in show business today. It would be a mistake not to praise the outstanding work by both Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz, to say their portrayal of an ex-slave turned bounty hunter and ex-dentist turned bounty hunter was exceptional would be an understatement. Also another wonderful performance from the ever consistent Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of a cruel plantation slave owner. Listen, this movie is a must see adventure western, yes there is plenty of blood and guts but you've got to expect that with Quentin Tarantino films, this is such an unique step back into the pre-civil war slave era, to miss this journey and saga would be a big mistake.",10,1,4,17 January 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Action packed and fun, but so totally confusing and muddled
","This latest Bourne movie is a fast paced action packed movie with incredible chase scenes and clever situations and escapes. I thought the actors were all decent and convincing in their roles. For those of you that love fast paced action, violence, and fans of the Bourne movie series I suspect you'll find this movie is everything you want and hope for. But for those of us that would like a storyline that actually makes sense and is moderately easy to follow, well then this one fails to deliver on those lines. When watching this I kept telling myself that this will all make sense eventually, that the plot will come clear soon, and that all the pieces will fit. Unfortunately I find those essential elements of movie making were not present in this one. There was a lot to like about this movie, but there was also a lot to dislike. I wish the producers and script writers would of done a better job of plot development, had they done so this movie would rate way better than just mediocre.",6,0,1,14 December 2012
Lincoln," Lincoln doesn't get my vote for movie of the year
","So much hype by the studio for this movie, and for Daniel Day-Lewis in his lead portrayal as Abraham Lincoln, why does it all seem to fall short for me? The reason is simple, it's wordy, slow moving, and lacks drama. Steven Spielberg is without a doubt one of if not the best director in the industry, but this epic is a dry lackluster diatribe in boredom. I'll give it to the historians who watch this and who will love this movie, but for the typical 'Joe six pack' average movie goer, this movie is simply a sleep fest. So here's my take-away, if you watch movies for entertainment purposes, there are way better choices than this. If you want history with long oral diatribes, this baby fills the bill. One last word-Daniel Day-Lewis is truly a superb actor, and he is very good in this role, but was it the best of the year? I say no, actually Anthony Hopkins who wasn't even nominated for his role in Hitchcock was far and away much more convincing and brilliant and was robbed in not only not be nominated and or winning.",5,5,10,6 March 2013
Love & Mercy," Lord have MERCY, I didn't LOVE it
","If there is any thing certain, it's that you cannot judge your movie picks based on the ratings given on this site. This so called movie is so bad, so boring, so long, and so much of a complete and total waste of time, that one feels dumber simply having watched it. I must continue...should you decide to trust other reviewers and watch this drivel, keep you finger on the fast forward button, as that really is the only way to get through this bore-fest.Let me start with I really do like the Beach Boys, I like and respect Brian Wilson, he is a music icon and genius and deserves so much better than this crap. His story could be and should be compelling and interesting to music lovers, but this sad so called production does him and his story an huge dis-service. I cannot find any redeeming factors in this movie other than Elizabeth Banks is really a cutie, other than that the acting is over the top, the story is NOT developed, and they really don't even include any Beach Boy music other than short snip-its of their songs just to tease you. That said why watch this? My suggestion....DON'T!!!",1,15,27,3 January 2016
Jack Reacher," Jack Reacher....... just good fun
","Having never read any Lee Childs novels regarding Jack Reacher, I went into this one with somewhat limited knowledge on who Jack Reacher is and what his claim to fame is. So like many, I read where the 'serious' fans were disappointed that Tom Cruise was picked to portray this iconic hero. To them I say, so what, did you watch this movie? In truth Tom Cruise is very good in this role, the movie is fast paced and action packed, the writing is cleaver and spot on, so to those who would continue to pan this movie I say lighten up and relax. This was a very good movie, Tom Cruise was good in the lead role, the several one-liners were very cleaver and kept a sense of humor in a plot with plenty of violence and too close for comfort realism. This movie was good, it was entertaining, well acted, and should be viewed and enjoyed by all who watch it.",8,96,150,20 April 2013
Les Misérables," Les Miserables is miserable
","When so many people love this movie I get to thinking why am I so off track with my feelings about this musical. Maybe I just don't get it, maybe it's because I wasn't that familiar with the Broadway production, maybe it's because I went to this movie to be entertained....big mistake. Now don't get me wrong, the production sets, acting, costumes, and big screen epic stature are all there, but what was missing was the emotional story and connection to the audience. I guess I knew this wasn't for me about 10 minutes into this seemingly long slow moving movie when I found I was already wondering how long until it would be over. Now I'll admit the only song I really knew going into this movie was ' I dreamed a dream' however, the endless non melodic off key vocalization by the entire cast with the exception of Anne Hathaway in my humble opinion simply ruined any chance this production would work for me and those movie goers who were seeking a memorable story put to music. I like the 1998 movie production staring Liam Neesom so much more than this miserable attempt. Simply put this movie was a huge disappointment, no in truth it STUNK...sorry but I call them as I see them.",3,35,69,11 January 2013
Jersey Boys," Frankie Vali would roll over in his grave if he were dead
","IMDb ratings are totally out of whack!! This movie deserves at best a 2, and John Lloyd Young who portrays Frankie Vali should be ashamed of himself for taking on this role.First lets start with the story. There just isn't enough there to make a major motion picture out of. Yeah, it's an interesting rise to fame for this GREAT group, but there is absolutely no drama, nothing to entertain or hook the viewer unless you are waiting to hear some of your favorite 4 Season tunes. But wait they even screw that up.....John Lloyd Young plays the role of Frankie Vali...ugh! Not only can this guy NOT act, he can't sing, and for sure he can't and doesn't sound anything like Frankie Vali. This guy tries to sing falsetto but in truth sounds like he's singing through his nose with a bad cold. Was Frankie Vali a complete and total nerd all his life? This so called actor makes him out to be the biggest bumbling nerd to ever grace this earth.Here's the bottom line on this movie, if you like the 4 Season's go buy there greatest hits CD, check out the Broadway play, but avoid this mindless, stupid movie. If you like Frankie Vali DO NOT WATCH John Lloyd Young ruin whatever image you had of Frankie. Finally, what the heck has happened to Clint Eastwood. He has been completely off the mark in his last 2 efforts. This movie was so bad it should kill the careers of Clint Eastwood and John Lloyd Young forever.",2,13,21,15 December 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Good movie, NOT worthy of movie of the year praise
","The hype that has followed the release of this movie had me believing that this was going to be the one, this was going to simply blow me away with action, intensity, and marvelous film making. Unfortunately it didn't deliver any of that for me, I found it to be too detailed and hard to follow in their quest to find and kill Bin Laden. In actuality, this was more a documentary than an action thriller, so if you're looking for something other than historical facts leading up to the finding and killing of Bin Laden, this one is not for you.Acting wise Jessica Chastain is exceptional in her role, Jason Clarke was also excellent, as was the entire cast of this movie. For me overall I was disappointed with this one, and while I'd say the first part of the movie is tiring and slow, the second part did have some drama and intensity, but it was too little to late for what has been hyped as a strong candidate for movie of the year.....sorry this one will not get my vote.",5,13,36,6 January 2013
Prometheus," This movie delivers on all levels
","This is a Ridley Scott movie, so if you watch it and I hope you do, and then it seems all to familiar, that is because it is an 'Alien' clone right down to the female heroine. I found this movie to be a very pleasant surprise, it's an edge of your seat, nail biting action packed sci-fi thriller that has the story, acting, direction, and special effects to make this a top notch entertaining sci-fi film. There are several reviews on this site that you can sift through, but I'll just cut to the chase, this is an excellent movie well worth owning and watching. While there may be many unanswered questions with this movie, I'm hopeful that a sequel is in the offing.",10,12,24,20 October 2012
Taken 2," Taken 2 takes your money-time-and leaves you feelin taken!
","No this is NOT the worst movie of 2012, it fact there are so many other crappy movies out there that in comparison, this movies is pretty darn good. BUT.....this movie really isn't very good, it's predictable, the acting is robotic and stiff, the action scenes are almost laughable, Liam Neeson moves like he's an old man with arthritis, the bad guys are so stupid that they don't deserve to live, and yet will all that said this is still kind of a fun movie to watch. The problem is I loved the original TAKEN movie, so when this one came along I went into it with high hopes, and there in lies the problem. Had I read a review like this prior to viewing, I think I wouldn't have been so sorely disappointed. For those of you who also enjoyed the original TAKEN, let me now warn you, this is a hollow shell of a sequel, but as action movies go, this is not a total waste either, thus I rate it a 5 star out of a possible 10.",5,2,2,24 January 2013
Flight," Flight takes off
","Lots and lots of hype about this fine movie, seems like everybody loves this one and with good reason, this is an excellent piece of movie magic. The storyline is brilliant, the acting by all is truly outstanding, the drama and tension is riveting, and let's face it, anything Danzel Washington is in is going to be good. Speaking of Danzel Washington, he once again shows why he is consistently considered one of the finest male leads in Hollywood. And while this role is something quite different from what we've seen from him in the past, his portrayal is spellbinding and Oscar worthy. My suggestion is to fasten your seat belt, put your tray in the upright position, sit back and enjoy.",8,0,2,13 February 2013
Looper," Looper throws YOU for a loop
","This original screenplay has some elements that are truly unique and inventive, the concept while done before in other movies is really borderline brilliant. That said you may be wondering why all the negative reviews and why I'm only giving it a 6 out of 10 rating. The problem with this one, and in my opinion a fairly big problem is that the theme or plot is difficult to surround. The characters try and set up the premise of the story but it never truly comes clear to the viewer. You'll spend the entire movie trying to figure how, what, and why things happen as they do. I like movies where you are required to think and make assumptions involving characters and plot lines, but this movie just flat out leaves too many blank spots in the story and character development. While the action is good, the acting competent, and there is enough good to sustain your interest right to the bitter end, the flaws are just to big to make this attempt anymore than an average movie with what could of been an exceptional and original idea.",6,1,3,20 November 2012
