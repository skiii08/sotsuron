The Blair Witch Project," What a snooze....
","I cannot believe that anyone thought this movie was scary.  I'm pretty easily scared and I did not feel scared for one second during the entire film.  I think part of the reason for this is the format.  The entire movie is done with handheld video cameras, and with people talking at the camera. For a movie to be scary, I have to feel like I'm there myself, and then whatever is threatening the characters feels like a threat to me too.  In this movie, I was constantly, painfully aware that I was sitting in a theater watching a movie, and the distance that that created between me and the 'scary' events made them not even remotely frightening.",2,0,3,2 August 1999
