Requiem for a Dream," *sigh*
","Unreal.  That's the only thing I can say.  This movie is totally unreal. Not in the way you might think i'm saying it is, but in the way a person would normally say it is.  It is simply to good to be true.  Basically, this is D.A.R.E.'s international promo-film for adults.  It is the most impressive anti-drug film I have seen.  The movie follows four people, Harry (Jared Leto), Marion (Jennifer Connely), Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), and Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn).  Each one of them has a story to tell.  Each one of them tells it in the most horrifying way.  Each one succumbs, at the end, to their addiction.  We see how drugs affect you mentally, emotionall, and physically.  How they destroy your will to resist and, ultimately, destroy you.  It is definately not a movie for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach.  Harry's story alone will give you cause for being nauseated.  It really is disgusting what Heroin does to him.  As I said, if you dont like to lose yourself, stay away from this movie.  If you enjoy that, or dont care, i'd like to say this: You're psychotic!  Just kidding. But seriously, I dont cry easily at the movies, but what I saw almost brought me to tears.",Null,0,1,24 October 2003
The Dark Knight," Oh sweet merciful Lord, that there can actually be sequels that surpass the originals
","I saw this movie, just last night, at an advanced screening for the theater. I was not terribly looking forward to it initially because I figured it was just another Batman movie. Yes, Christopher Nolan was directing it and he also directed the movie that renewed my faith in the Batman series (Batman Begins), but it was just another sequel in my mind. wait for it to come to DVD, I thought. So my friend got me a free ticket to this screening and I went. All I can say is this (and I am not exaggerating): It Is THE Best Superhero Movie EVER. A true psychological thriller, Nolan slowly builds the suspense, terror and madness each minute you watch. At first, Oh sure it's the Joker. Biiig deal, he kills some of his own henchmen. But gradually, the diabolical mind behind the clownface emerges (demonstrated absolutely flawlessly by the late Heath Ledger). Batman, played by Christian Bale, is as dark and brooding as he was in Begins. His gadgetry and the quality of his costume is improving, but he is also gaining admirers in some strange places as small-time criminals begin to emulate him--something he refuses to accept, they ARE criminals after all. Bale's portrayal is perfect. Vengeful anti-hero by night, Billionaire jackass by day. In this movie, he is charged with cleaning up the mob from the Gotham City streets. Utilizing the legal powers of Dent and Gordon's access to city officials, he does this, clearing Gotham of the scum in one magnificent swoop. Hooray for our hero. Fortunately, the movie does not end there. A string of deaths occurs, all masterminded by the same diabolical villain and Batman makes it his personal quest to rid the world of the Joker. As people begin to blame him for the mounting hysteria, Bruce Wayne begins to falter. Drawing into himself, he tries to shoulder the responsibility onto Dent more and more. But Dent has a weakness, the same one Bruce does. And when she dies, with Dent listening over a radio, it is the final straw breaking for him. Maggie Gylenhaal portrays the role of Rachel Dawes, thankfully, grabbing it from the poor acting of Katie Holmes. Rachel's role is fairly minor, unfortunately, but there really is no back story to her. Not in the comic anyway. While Gylenhaal is there, she plays a much better Rachel than Holmes...though that is not saying much. Aaron Eckhardt, a man I almost immediately recognized from his role as the main character of 'Thank You For Smoking', plays the 'White Knight of Gotham', D.A. Harvey Dent. This is a man destined to plummet into the depths of complete and utter insanity, as the villain Two-Face. Everyone in the theater saw it coming when he did. That doesn't take away from Eckhardt's portrayal of the driven Dent, who allies with Batman and James Gordon to rid Gotham City of the Mob. He is equally magnificent in his fall. I never forgave Tommy Lee Jones for destroying my vision of Two-Face in Batman Forever...but there were a lot of mistakes in that movie. I digress. Two-Face may be a psychotic, but he is NOT a giggling, twerpy psychotic. He retains Dent's drive and powerful charisma. Eckhardt and Nolan flesh this out beautifully. But all of this pales in comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker. The movie may be about Batman, but it is the Joker's movie, without question. I had always felt that Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker was done well. It was cartoonish to Ledger's maniacal villain. From the outset, as he so deviously states, he is out to 'send a message.' The message is that anyone in this 'sophisticated' society that we cling to can fall to his depths with just the right push. His very demeanor was so creepy and so histrionic that it had everyone in the theater on the edges of their seats. And he wins, in spades, as he finds a way of turning Gotham's 'greatest hope' and the man Batman sees as his public face, into something similar to him. Ledger, for those two and a half hours, is the embodiment of the chaos of the Joker. He captivates. It may be the most incredible bit of acting I have ever seen.But don't take my word for it. Go see the movie.",10,9,19,18 July 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Effective...on several levels
","Once again, the Matrix has us.  Chicago's Wachowski Brothers, after revealing the penultimate in special effects with 'bullet-time' (the scenes of morphed time and space where the actor or actress can dodge bullets or suspend themselves in mid-air while the camera pans around them), showcase the next level of SFX in their evil pair of 'ghosting' programs - the Rayment Twins.  Not only are the special effects...well...spectacular, but the plot evolves the entire storyline of the blossoming trilogy.  In this second installment, we learn that Zion itself is in danger.  The machines have discovered it's location and are burrowing through the Earth to reach it.  Several ships are asked to remain behind inside the Matrix to wait for word from the Oracle.  On top of all that, Neo begins having prophetic nightmares about Trinity's fate.For a guy who is known more for his looks than his acting, Keanu Reeves once again pulls off the acting job for Neo brilliantly.  Perhaps this part was made for him, or he was meant to play it.  Perhaps the part may could have been played by any other actor.  That will be debated for sometime.For all it's glitz and glamor, The Matrix: Reloaded still has room for a storyline that would work without the special effects.",Null,0,0,13 June 2003
Army of Darkness," A very funny, stupid movie
","From the mind that spawned Xena and Young Hercules comes a brilliant farce about a man from the 20th century hurled backwards in time and forced to destroy an ancient evil if he wants to get back home. Sam Raimi is well known as the man who transferred Stephen King's 'the Shining' into a movie form. Here, he goes beyond horror into horror spoof. Army of Darkness might *look* like a poorly-made B-type movie, but that's really purely wonderful directing. It's *supposed* to look like a B movie because it engages in a lot of playful mocking of undead horror movies like 'Night of the Living Dead.' It is also the movie from which emerges one of the all-time classic lines of all time: 'This...is my BOOMSTICK!!'",7,2,3,22 June 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Horrendous!!!
","If it were possible to vote in negative numbers I would give this movie a -10. I left this movie after about 20 minutes of torture. I hated how it was supposed to be a satire of the hayseed world of NASCAR, but did a poor job of it. Will Ferrell is the WORST actor in history and he shows it here. The plot was ridiculous. And with the exception of Sacha Beren Cohen (John Girard), the acting was pitifully awful. This was supposed to be a comedy, but it felt like a tragedy because I was almost in tears. Unless you absolutely adore Will Ferrell, Do NOT see this movie. PLEASE Will Ferrell. Leave. Just go away and never make another movie again.",1,3,7,1 January 2007
