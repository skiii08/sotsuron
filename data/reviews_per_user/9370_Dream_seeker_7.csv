United 93," A very deeply moving picture of realism and true heroism in the face of national tragedy
","I've gotten a chance to see this movie on HBO recently, and I have to say no matter where you were during the time of Sept 11, 2001 this movie puts sadness as well as courage in your heart with great conviction as well as realistic people. The director did a great job assembling unknowns as the passengers it brings true fear and realism to the task of this film as well as bravery and danger in spite of recent events. If you already know the story from TV, news or maybe from being around the areas when the planes hit then you already know this movie...if not then let me explain briefly...this is based on the real life attack on America during Sept. 11 when four planes were taken control by terrorist...united 93 was one of those planes taken hostage and of course the story of the brave passengers that witness the ordeal first hand before the end; as a man I have to admit I wanted to cry being that it does hit you with that same fear the actors and actress felt in a closed situation but it also gives you that feeling of strength when the plan was made to try to fight for the plane.The bravado in this movie is simply realistic right up to those two words, 'let's roll' the focus never loss touch with that fear and danger in close quarters in fact the camera action as well as the people involved make you feel as if you are within the confines of the plane feeling what their feeling and getting angry when they are getting angry and again the director did a good job with this feeling. So what's the flaw to it....well for one thing it will get to you if you knew someone on the flights during those times it's very sad to see a movie that shows that art can REALLY imitate life sometimes and this movie does that. with movies like, 'World trade center' which is another emotional movie this one did it job without making it into a action flick...the comrade and the interactions in this movie was well done without adding too much or giving away too much...not being all dramatic but not being all action driven either I also have to give credit to the composer John Powell the music puts a move in your heart right up to the end credits and it wasn't dramatic nor cheesy it was just right...so I feel this movie is worth seeing just bring some Kleenex with you just in case. 9/10",9,0,0,27 April 2007
Balls of Fury," Tacky and still falls under the exact typical-ness of a east meets west movie
","For nearly a decade there have been action, adventure, and even romantic comedies that have a strong interest and emphasis of the 'east meet west' culture...i'm sure you seen this story a thousand times...middle aged or middle class Caucasian man goes either the the east or somewhere in the world meets up with Asian female (or east Indian depending on your movie and/or director who can't seem to find any other male of a different race appreciative for the main character role)...they have some weird and interesting adventures and then they hook up; yada, yada, yada....FINE!!! and if you don't believe that this type of obviousness exist check out movies like, 'Snow falls on cedars' or 'The last samurai', how about, 'The quiet American' or how about something recent like oh...,'The forbidden kingdom' and another movie coming soon with Nicolas cage (Bancock Dangerous)or an upcoming movie with Hugh grant and zhang ziyi (HUGH GRANT...COME ON!!). This will continue sadly until someone from the minority starts to see this happen and say, 'hey...i'm just as good as that person too and i'm BLACK or Asian or LATINO!' (Afro-American male actors very seldom is portrayed as a main character in a east meet west role and no 'Mississippi Masala' doesn't count!) But until then we are going to get the same tacky, and typical movies that displays a another case of the 'Asian East meets Caucasian west' and, 'Balls of fury' is another attempt at this from a comedian side of the spectrum. Now don't get me wrong Maggie Q and Aisha Tyler are HOT in this movie....but that's as far as good credit i will put towards this film. The jokes are not as funny, they try to overdo the comedy way too much and i felt that was making my head hurt, and GEORGE LOPEZ!!? come on what's wrong director and the casters that find these actors couldn't find a REAL comedian lately!? I mean Kevin Hart is more funny than this dude and he's an underdog comedian! The plot tries to be serious but fails badly...in a nutshell, Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) a failed ping pong player is given an opportunity from the FBI to go undercover to stop some gunrunner Feng (Christopher Walken) and expose his true plan but in order to gain trust he has to play...yep you guessed it, PING PONG to stay one step ahead and outwit *or try to!* the opposition. Now, let's see what's wrong with this picture well i say....EVERYTHING! again Feng who is played by Christopher Walken, a man that has been nominated many times in GOOD MOVIES to suddenly be dropped in this bat of acid; that's like Ben Kingsley in, 'Bloodrayne' what are you doing!!? again in the typical of nature a Caucasian man trying to fit into the Asian culture and did it badly; it was really sad to see him placed in this position but i'm sure others will disagree but its really up to you to figure this out for yourself. The plot and storyline had a bit of the 'Enter the dragon' aspect but they tried to copy on that in some weird mock-ish way. The romance between Randy and ironically Maggie was again falling under a typical line up of east meets west romance and i found that faulting, I felt that the direction could of made this comedy an actual comedy but the premise wasn't there to put that up this film in the standards of what comedy is.The end result, was a poorly made movie for my taste there was no direction to this it was trying to make a straight out laugh movie but it didn't do that for me all it did was make me shake my head and mutter, 'Typical, typical, and more typical' cause that's all it was. But beggars can't be choosers and what's bad for me might be different for the next person and when you come in watching this movie i guess you have to keep an open mind and i did...but it gave me a headache after the first hour so you can read this review but the choice is yours to figure if this movie was good...but you might as well rent this film cause you might want to take it back after its done.4/10Story: I felt this didn't have much of a story going for it; the plot outline is straight laced but that was about it. It faltered a great deal and that what made me lose interest in the movie.Character Development/acting: Lack there was, seeing Maggie Q in something sexy and Aisha Tyler were the only two reasons i was watching this movie besides that...the characters were dull, and unsurprisingly overdoing their roles.Direction: Its amazing these days that directors,writers, and people that finds these actors keep looking towards the same type of east meets west romance...its a sad state of affairs in Hollywood or wherever you go that they can't find an actor that's within the minority for a main character role, and don't get me wrong certain actors an play certain roles great and some i feel that they must of known the director or someone to get in that way...either way you put it was typical to my taste and very tiresome and hell will freeze over when i see a movie where the Afro-American main male lead gets swept into a fantasy ancient china to save a kingdom and fall in love with the woman and save the world and all of that lord knows that might be just as good as well...but i doubt that will happen; but one can dream so until this....movies like this will continue....sadly.",2,1,4,28 July 2008
Spider-Man 3," Simply still the best superhero movie despite mixed reviews...
","I'm sure you seen the mixed reviews and heard it thru the grapevine by friends and friends of friends; but there's still no denying yes...Mary j sings and yes Toby's character does have a weird dance moment along with a strange 70's beat to it which is very funny but no matter what you hear good or bad Spider-man 3 starts the summer movie season with a bang and still keep it coming with the goods. Spider-man 3 continues directly where Spiderman 2 (or Spiderman 2.1 depends on what you watched or liked more) left off having Mary J. Watson (Kristin dunst) finding out that Peter parker (Toby McGuire) is spider man all this time. Thus, begins a good and bad whirlwind of events that sets the tone for even shocking revelations and life-changing choices that makes even peter questions his 'Great power' and the responsibilities to go with it. While Mary and peter enjoy a good night together a strange star fell from the sky and landed directly around there area....coincidence I think not! but this is no star nor rock but something far more dangerous and will test peter's heart as well as choices in his somewhat good part of his life; Meanwhile elsewhere a convict is on the run once again but it seems luck gives him a bad hand again when he becomes a unwilling test subject that will give him the power over sands and lets not forget the vengeful son........okay let's start with the story...as you can tell its very convoluted and that's one of two gripes I have with this movie; they mixed in too much of the elements of the different villains stories so much that you can tell that the story was a rushed job to some degree making the movie somewhat either rushed or confusing in some parts; we never really understood how the symbiont code name 'Venom' even found its way to earth all we just know is that it got here...nothing more! And the sandman's character as much as I liked his character you really wished there was more depth to him because he seem like a good man who pretty much had bad luck and still continuing to have it. and of course Hobgoblin (aka green goblin 2) we already know his story so we are not going to go into that neck of the woods; put all of this together you got yourself a lot of great and awesome fight scenes that you also wished they were emphasized on the work done and choreographed to make the special effects and fights were pretty damn good and it just make you want to leap out of your seat at the awesomeness that it brings.Unlike some other movie (ahem X-men: last stand) this movie puts more personal touches which is REALLY good; giving Peter and the other characters realism and life making choices along with tough choices that can make any one of us question, 'now that we found the truth what would we do?' and, 'how would we react to something like that!?' Peter's journey to the dark side can sometimes remind us that we have a same side when it comes to private justice if something happens to any one of our family members which again is good but then going back to the story being rushed you lose that moment and feeling along the way but it does show back up again which brings a more darker tone to this movie and even though they were trying to add funny elements to it still felt really good to see a dark side to peter's confidence that he now has. all of the actors did good regardless of the mixed reviews and the quality still makes this the best superhero movie bar none; and even though they tried really hard to put all of the stories together the aspect and adventure to this film you'll come out feeling like it doesn't really matter cause you had a fun time. And that's what this movie does it makes you sit and eat your popcorn have fun and sometimes get a little sappy while you're at it.My second gripe is not actually a problem persey but I've just wished the fights were more extended and that the emotional tone wasn't pushed a notch but then again if they didn't do that you wouldn't have much realism to the characters thus the end result would be making this movie pure action, with lots of pointless casualties that comes out of left field, and a lacking plot unlike some movies (x-men: last stand) but they didn't go down that path and that's GREAT! All in all, at the start of the summer movies is this movie worth going to see? yes, I think it is but my only suggestion is take the movie for what it is...a fun, emotional, thrill ride nothing more and nothing less don't expect too much from it or you will be disappointed and don't expect too less of it or you will misjudge the movie just take it for what it is cause spider man is still a great example of a good superhero movie.Now let's hope that 'iron man' falls under the line...8/10",8,1,3,6 May 2007
Cloverfield," Possibly the closest original Monster movie that's actually good!!!
","Before I get into being the critic i have to say this, when walking into this movie you have to remember 1 thing; that this movie is being done by hand held camera so unless you haven't seen a movie that was dealt in this type of aspect (Aka. Blair witch) then you might find this difficult to watch but it depends on the viewer. Now i will get into the criticism.I have to give it to J.J. Abrams for amping the people up with the secret type of trailers and websites that gives prelude to this anticipated movie and finally when going to see this movie i was expecting the hand held shaky camera feel so i wasn't surprised at the outcome cause it just adds more depth as well as realism to the ride. The story....well...there's not much of a story; technically, its more so a documentation that was left via SD card during the aftermath of what happened and picked up by the military to be viewed and that's where the fun begins. What makes this movie even more realistic is the fact that they don't know much about the monster than we do when watching it; so when they know as much we do too (in a sense of the word); thus adding a scary reality to the threat this movie provides and gives that much originality to the focus of the movie.The actors are a close to real as they can get and even though there were some that would be confused by the time jumping during the camera scenes when you put 2 and 2 together you get to understand what is going on between the characters of Beth and Rob and their somewhat shaky relationship before, during, and after the horrific events so in a way one would or could make it out to be a love story in the middle of an apocalyptic event; But this movie didn't need a soundtrack cause it added just as much tension without it, you feel for these characters as well as dread the monsters that seem to come out of the woodwork during the battle scenes and that's where the awesome special effects comes in. I can't compare this movie to Blair witch cause as much as there is an identical feel there is a significant difference, Blair witch is more on a psychological aspect. Whereas for Cloverfield this is drowned in awesome special effect that seems to mesh very well with the real hand-camera the action picks up strong in certain parts of the movie giving it a deeper tone as well as fear for the people portrayed in this movie.This is a love or hate movie, some will love the direction that this movie puts on the audience as well as how it was well written and directed as well as the not-knowing until they know aspect which i felt was greatly on point cause even the military didn't know what they were facing so this movie won't hold your hand in anything cause our guess is as good as theirs. Some will hate this movie cause of that same approach i've mention...you see some people want to know ahead of time what is going to happen or who they are going to face but when you have something like that...you don't get that sense of dread and surprise but most want that; also the camera isn't the best and these guys run...and run, and run so you have to deal with that from time to time if not all the time...i'm sure there are other, 'Love, hate' reasons but i think i said too much.I give this movie an 8 simply cause its even though it has lack of story it holds a deeper, original, realistic feel for danger as well as a typical love story which gets you into their world. Also, the shear not knowing until the characters know made this movie just as real as if this was caught by surprise as the next person and you get more hints as they know which. Along with damn good special effects this movie did a good job making people anticipate and it didn't let me down which some movies would do sometimes when faced with that type of hype.Plus, I thought the woman playing lily was HOT!!",8,2,5,25 January 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," A person's second opinion about: X-men: the last stand
","Recently i've gotten the chance to read, 'Astonishing X-men' joss whedon's vision of the xmen and the cure that comes with it...i've also taken the opportunity to read the dark phoenix saga written by Chris Claremont and and try to put two of them together in a way that the movie did...unfortunately, the results ended badly and thats' why i'm giving my second opinion of X-men: the last stand.The last review i made of this movie i really lashed out at it without giving a reasonable view of this movie. Truth be told, I REALLY didn't like this movie on the basis of a convoluted story arc that tried REALLY hard to be put together by the screenplay writers. Much like spider-man 3 tried to do they, 'Tried' to merge different stories to make a much interesting and maybe action-packed movie but failed on the idea that maybe it was a bad idea and just stick try and true with the original story at hand and it made me wish for Joss whedon's view cause for the action and character depth. But let me point some of the good before the bad just to be fair, for those that like this movie i can say this movie was a good, 'popcorn flick' as far as the action/adventure is concern. The fight scenes were fast and intense and the music made the pace just as good; I enjoyed how fast and cool they made this work out in their favor. However now for the bad, Brett Ratner's vision isn't up to par with such directors like Singer or long term comic writers like Claremont or bendis; his focus was more intent on two characters...storm (Halie berry) and wolverine (Hugh Jackman) which for some way storm DID get a longer part which I'm not complaining but when its at the cost of some those other characters that deserved their time as well in one form it was being selfish on the director's part.Other X-men vets did make an appearance like the Beast (Kelsey grammar) who did pretty damn good for taking the time to dress like a, 'Blue fur ball' and then there's angel (Ben foster) who's very talented as well as athletic so i can see why they chose him for this role but you only see at least 15 mins of his character before he walks off or disappears into the crowd of the less important co-stars...word to the directors, if you are going to put a character on a poster claiming that he will be in most of all the scenes of the movie....MAKE IT SO! if this was the case you might as well had him come into the room and say, 'hi guys, i'm angel' and walk away and never see him again which i felt it was really unfair to most of the fans who were expecting him to be part of the fight and climax for the long run. Now lets move to the story...as much as it was full of action which I thought was hot, the story was not! Technically in a nutshell, taken place a month after X2 Jene gray sacrificed herself to save her teammates knowing that there was a deeper power lurking that saved her and it was about to show itself; meanwhile doctors Kavita rao and warren Worthington Sr. created a 'cure' that can solve the mutant 'problem' most will take it and others will oppose against it...like magneto who believed a war is brewing against homo sapiens (Humans) and mutants which is happening. IN the middle Scott summers is grieving...everyone somewhat forgot about Jeane...Phoenix has risen some X-men characters die and phoenix don't do crap except stand in the background as a poster child or reminder to join magneto's crew which i found really insulting giving she's is powerful than magneto and the whole mutant-kind combined.which leads to a whole new set of problems, the direction, as much as it was fun to watch the story and direction was all over the place...lack of character depth of new characters and understanding of old ones puts this movie on a downward spiral; it got caught up in its own action that it forgot the purpose to what the dark phoenix saga was about...i mean a comic fan would ask, 'where's the hellfire club?' and 'shouldn't Emma frost be introduced to this?' which was never asked thus leading this movie into a confusing twist of just action nothing more...nothing less. Jugganaunt was cool, and the line at the climax did make me clap but that's all it was an enjoyable feast. Honestly, after reading both comics i saw Whedon's vision and wanted THAT version into this movie if it was going to stick to the 'Cure'. But if they were going the route of the Dark Phoenix they should of added the elements that the comic portrayed like the hellfire club and ms. frost instead of setting off meaningless deaths that should of never happened.All in all, I give it a '5' cause even though this movie was fun, and going into the movie leaving your mind behind is a good way to enjoy this movie; most movie goers go into this movie hoping of a good story to go behind it; this movie was confused in its own world and too hyped up for its own good making this movie a confused mess; i didn't know where the story was going and why characters didn't stay to fight it was unfair to most true comic fans to see something like this made in a way that didn't set the bar of the comic itself instead it just made it a roller coaster ride of adventure with no development whatsoever thus is why i don't like this movie cause it lost that feeling of what the other two movies tried to do.",5,1,3,6 May 2007
Mission: Impossible II," if you want good intellect, Human aspect, and adventure watch the first mission impossible and Mi: 3 NOT this crap
","Don't get me wrong, years and years ago when I seen the trailer for this...I thought, John woo directing this is awesome; then I saw this movie and from my impression not only I felt really insulted but also cheated at the fact that Mr. Woo added pretty much everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink to explode on impact with merely one bullet and some flashy moves. No disrespect to the director he really is good at his game....when he was doing old school Hong Kong flicks like hard boiled! Mission Impossible 2 (aka Mi: 2) was the long awaited and anticipated sequel to the 1996 sleeper blockbuster and based off the highly successful TV show also with the same name. But in all honestly, this movie didn't raise the bar it just made it worse and nearly almost screwed up this franchise if it wasn't for J.J. Abrams smart approach to the third installment. Tom Cruise returns as the now almost superhuman Ethan hunt who pretty much makes it clear that bullets can't touch him, he can scale mountains with his bare hands, perform flashy martial arts, and have time to woo the girl with his charms damn I'm surprise he's not playing the saxophone and surfing the stair rails blindfolded while shooting the bad guys left and right....wait a minute...I think he did do that!! The storyline is weak but simple, You see there's a virus that is capable of wiping out humanity and they gave it a code name: Chimera (oooh Greek roman history lesson somewhere) but in other to fight against this virus a anti-virus was created code name: Balerafont (cause even in viruses there are good verses evil battles!) so of course there's a race against time and they eventually needed someone who can get the job done but unfortunately superman/Ethan was climbing mountains with bare hands and another partner a sexy thief by the name of Nya (Thandie Newton)..oh yeah I forgot his team of Luther and Billy Barty (did I mention that both characters are hardly seen as much in this movie) and who can bring these guys together than Hannibal himself (Anthony Hopkins) which I think the was only there cause they must of paid him a lot but the look on his face said he was pretty much bored in this film but you be the judge on that.Lets face it the story was sub par bad (due to bad and lack of script), the romantic kindling between Tom and Thandie's character was VERY much rushed and obviously typical to the movie goer, and the bad guys were pretty much whinny little babies that can't shoot straight for the life of them but yet Ethan aka. The batman can hide in the shadows make, one shot an explosive one every damn time, can pop wheelies and burn rubber on the side with his feet while riding a motorcycle at very high speeds...did I mention he can cook too!? John Woo's approach wasn't bent on intellect like the first one and third, you can see him trying but it failed in many areas I mean DAMN even Luther (Ving rhames) didn't get that much screen time it was like Woo was saying, 'screw the black man, I want super white guy flashing his pretty hair every chance he gets' I mean its not like woo hasn't done that before (The big hit and pretty much ALL his Americanized movies). The action scenes were pretty much IMPOSSIBLE I seen tom pretty much risk his ass in ridiculous moments in this movie it made me wonder, 'I wish I can do that!!' but then was hit with reality and physics. This movie is pretty much a stuntman's dream with the white dove even at the climax I felt really cheated being that I could of sworn I've seen the dual shootout before (face/off) I could say more to why I didn't like this movie but I'm going to watch Mi: 3 on DVD now and be reminded on what could of been done to part 2.",4,1,2,8 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Still a great movie but a bit rushed in some areas
","Having reading mostly all the Harry potter books (except the final story) I've come to realize that these are definitely the definitive adventure stories of a boy coming of age and dealing with a huge weight on his shoulders of saving the world...typical you think but not so typical when you are Harry potter and this is another feat his in task.Harry potter and the goblet of fire is the Fourth story of a seven part adventure and believe me it gets darker and darker with each story and this is of no exception; the very upcoming talent of Daniel Radcliff returns once again as the still learning Harry potter the only difference now is that he is coming out of his own as he faces a new school year, a few new friends, as well as adolescence as he has a new crush of the very attractive cho chang (Katie Leung) but there's more to it than meets the eye and of course something wicked is growing beneath the shadows and a new danger awaits potter and his friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and the comical Ronald Weesley (Rupert Grint) but this is nothing new for the boy who lived as this is natural for him and his team.The movie don't get me wrong is another great adaptation of the book itself; it simplistic approach keeps the pace good and still brings the feel of the book to life on film...the characters are good and still funny and at times you know they have grown up when you realized the jokes are more grown up as well and in a way I'm sure that's what J.K. Rowling's wanted from the book and movie after all. The people are fleshed out from its childish nature of the previous movies so what you get is a more deeper tone to the movie which puts the movie in a serious category so expect more darker areas to be dealt with like the feeling of death and torture cause the time of childish play is over and this movie seemed to put that and make it known to the viewers that watch it as well but still adds the comical feel from the previous movies and that's still good.So when there's good there's also bad to this as well. Even though the characters were growing and more detailed they were also too dramatic as well. It sometimes felt that each of the characters overplayed the part and you can tell as the movie progresses you often would wonder or even say to yourself, 'that's a bit OVERDONE' or, 'okay it's not that serious calm down!' Dumbledore (played by Michael Gambon) in the book you find him as a very calm, intelligent, and a man that is one step ahead of the game than most people and no matter what you think he very rarely shows anger and if he does the book describe him as a man that can just look at you and you can tell if he's upset or otherwise....again this goes back to being overplayed and that's what happen it didn't really feel like the Dumbledore that you read about more like the man that had a big anger chip on his shoulder which that made me laugh at bit cause I thought it was funny how it was acted out.Also, the movie was a bit too rushed...director Mike Newell knew what he was doing and of course being that the actual book is nearly almost 300+ pages one can't cover all of the visions on a grand scale which is understandable but don't watch the movie expecting stuff that you read in the book cause unlike the previous movies you're not going to get it...in fact, you will ask yourself, 'wait...there was a part missing here' or, 'where's this character he was suppose to be here' or even, 'They completely took that out' in fact there are a lot of missing scenes that didn't cover nor explain completely...the DVD version has no deleted scenes unlike the other ones so a Harry potter fan would be somewhat disappointed at the fact that some scenes are gone to sacrifice for a much shorter film which can be a good or bad thing depending on your take but for me personally it was a bad move.All in all, despite of all of what it lacks this movie still held the end of its bargain in being an all time great movie not just for kids alone but for adults as well; and as HP grows so does the content and this is of no exception there is a dark cloud coming and its dealt with greatly in this movie...special effects are great as usual, and the connections between the characters are very good in some part and Ralph finnens as Voldemort was a very good choice cause he played the part very well...but don't go expecting the full book version cause that's not what you will get sadly...but expect a good ride of adventure, peril, as well as tragedy and all that put together makes a good movie and Harry potter and the goblet of fire is still that damn good! 9/10",9,0,1,30 April 2007
