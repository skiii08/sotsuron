Iron Man 3," My Honest Review
","I just got home from seeing this film and I have to say while it is miles better then the second movie it really was not a great movie. I felt there were a lot of plot holes. Now I do think its worth stating that all super hero movies have plot holes but this one more than most. In this movie it seemed like they focused on one thing he can do with suit ( make it come to him) he did this about 10 times in the movie. This focus made the other 'powers' of the suit fade into the back. Another point I feel the need to share is they didn't go into the antidote enough and all the sudden he breaths fire!!!??? Was just crazy and out of no where I think a lot of explaining is needed for the antidote. To sum up this movie had plenty of plot holes, too many bad guys to care, didn't make sense and didn't explain enough but was entertaining to watch I think a solid 6 is a generous.",6,2,4,3 May 2013
