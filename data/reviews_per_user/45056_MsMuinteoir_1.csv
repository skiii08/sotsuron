Changeling," Superb acting!
","I thought this film was just excellent. It is the only time I have properly enjoyed watching Angelina Jolie in a movie. She simply excelled. Clint Eastwood did such a good job directing this film. I actually had not read up on the film before watching it, and so I didn't know that it was based on a true story. While watching, I began to wonder if it was indeed based on fact, but then thought no, this surely did not happen for real. How wrong I was. I was astounded that the story was indeed true to life, just as I was astounded by the quality of acting. All the cast were well chosen. And Angelina, as leading lady, gave a flawless performance. I thoroughly recommend watching this!!",10,1,4,17 September 2010
