National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Fun, but overly contrived; a waste of acting ability & locations
","What was the magic of National Treasure 1? It was the sense of discovery with the pressure of a time-line in which to solve complex puzzles having interesting connections in history, all the while having the 'bad guys' attempting to do the same.That element is lost is NT2, and this film goes the way of Tomb Raider 2 by having the the good guys team up with the bad guys to solve the puzzle by forcing them to cooperate, but never with any real sense of a threat. This type of plot tool is very weak.The movie also wastes too much time in character development of Ben's mother and father which adds very little light humor, but serves to burn screen time and bog the film down rather than propel it. They should focus more on the verbal sparring between Ben and his tech buddy, Riley, which does more for humor in the film. Diane Kruger (Abigail) seems to be there for eye candy in this film, not really contributing much to the plot like she had in NT1 by hampering Ben's progress or threatening to take flight with clues Ben needed.NT2 seems to move 'too fluidly, too quickly.' The director simply wants to rush the viewer from location to location, seemingly for the sake of showing Ben in different locations as in NT1, but Ben solves puzzles so efficiently at lightening speed in NT2 that there's never the feeling as in NT1 of struggling over a conundrum. Ben seems to make historical connections so effortlessly that you're never on the edge of your seat, nor are the viewers ever given time to ponder the puzzles themselves. With the 'bad guys' teamed up with Ben, there's no sense of urgency. The antagonist isn't going to shoot so-and-so by such-and-such time, so why are we being rushed to the next filming location? It'd be nice if Ben and his crew DIDN'T get a clue right for once and then they generated some humor from that.Turteltaub needs to watch 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' again to understand character motivation. The main character is driven with purpose of action for well-defined and valid reasons. In 'Raiders' it's because Indiana doesn't want the bad guys to have possession/control of the Ark which could give the Nazis a powerful advantage during WW II. It's almost the same reason in the 3rd film--the Nazis want the Holy Grail which would tip the balance of power in their favor. All the while in both films, the lives of characters close to Indiana are put in peril. National Treasure 1 had similar character motivation. National Treasure 2 did not.Turteltaub, if you're reading this (hah! yeah, right), and considering a plot device for National Treasure 3 (based on page 47 of the book of secrets), then you should consider using the same plot device as Indiana Jones #3: Indiana Jones' father was missing (causing Indiana to act), then his father was shot (causing him to act to find the grail); place one of Ben's family members (Abigail as Ben's wife?) in mortal danger, forcing Ben to solve puzzles on a compressed time-line. It works all the time for the hit TV series, '24.' Bottom line: NT2 is a fun, mostly fast-paced ride from location/country to location, and if you set your brain on auto-pilot it's enjoyable. Hopefully NT3 will have the same suspense and wonder as NT1.",5,6,9,4 January 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," DON'T waste your money or time! This movie was SO BAD, it's a waste of film, time, and money!
","First of all:DON'T watch this movie! DON'T watch this movie! It is a WASTE of time and money!I'm not going to waste my own valuable time nor this website's space by writing a 'review' of this movie. It's not even worth the film on which it was shot. When you read the other negative reviews written here which describe how bad this movie is. BELIEVE them!This movie is one of the worst hack & slash, formulaic, idiotic movies ever -- poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly filmed.I accidentally ordered this movie on pay-per-view, confusing it with 'Silent Hill' (which I've read might not be all that great either), and what a disappointment this was. Fortunately we were able to fast-forward through much of it. I can't believe I watched even half of this stupid flick.",1,1,4,21 July 2006
No Country for Old Men," Not worth your time, nor an Academy Award, nor ANY award. A waste of time.
","Fortunately, I borrowed this disc (Blu-Ray) from a friend. Many of us use that common rating system: Is it worth seeing at the theater, or wait until it comes out on disc and rent it? Thankfully I didn't pay anything to see this movie because that's what it was worth. Bottom line, don't waste your time; it's VERY unfulfilling.I don't have any faith in the Academy Awards choosing best picture any longer. It seems that they had to give it to something, so why not this? I generally enjoy Tommy Lee Jones's acting, but for him to portray a Texas sheriff isn't much of a stretch at all; he's practically been typecast (US Marshalls, The Fugitive, etc). He's just older and more tired in this movie.The movie meanders along showing us senseless killings by the antagonist using a cattle gun and a shotgun with an enormous (uh, movie blunder) brushed nickel silencer (shotgun silencers are not very effective, and only cut the VERY loud noise by about 5-6 dB). The protagonists' character development never takes place, and we're supposed to sympathize with the older sheriff's bleak perspective of the country, senseless brutality, and futility of justice all from his monologue at the opening of the film and a few short scenes a few friends or his wife. It doesn't happen.Without giving anything away, the ending will probably leave you questioning: 'What, that's it?' You might sit there staring blankly at the screen (as many people did after Blair Witch Project) wondering what just happened and how it could have ended that way, but thankful that it's finally over.This movie was entirely over-rated, and is the perfect example of people thinking it's good simply because they've been told by others that it's a work of art and is good. Instead of behaving like mindless sheep, they should speak their own opinions rather than parrot the views of others and simply state: this movie was dismal. It was just plain bad. Many have said there is fine cinematography... if setting a camera up to shoot the wide Texas landscape is fine cinematography, then any idiot with a panoramic movie camera must be an incredible DP (Directory of Photography). The subject and location do NOT make fine cinematography. Lighting, focal length, aspect ratio, and filtering in addition to camera angle and movement are used to determine fine cinematography (and 'mood') such as shown in The Godfather in the opening scene.",1,11,22,8 July 2008
Iron Man," Excellent adaptation of the Iron Man comic, and one of the best movies of 2008!
","I was an avid reader and collector of the Iron Man comics as a kid, and this movie is one of the best comic book adaptations I have seen (comparing others such as Spider Man, etc).I was a bit worried to learn that Robert Downey Jr had been selected to play Tony Stark/Iron Man because I had felt that RD Jr. had wasted his talent and career on drugs, he was too arrogant, and he really had yet to 'prove himself' again. In short, he did prove himself here. He toned down his own ego enough to fit the character of Stark (a sort of Howard Huges knock-off) quite well. I have a new admiration for Downey Jr's ability to shake off the ghosts of his personal past and put forth a first-class acting job as Iron Man.The story is well-told, without excessive use of CGI, and a few nice sprinkles of humor.I rarely would rate a movie this high, but Iron Man is the complete package. It is very enjoyable, and easily calls for repeat-viewing (as soon as it's available on Blu-Ray).I've heard Downey Jr. comment on his desire to make MANY sequels, and if they're as good as the first (and only if they are), please make as many as you can.",9,1,2,18 June 2008
