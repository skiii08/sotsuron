Iron Man 3," Unexpectedly Disappointed
","Saw it today, expected a lot from it. However wat I got was disappointment.. dat too a lott...The script is very weak, Col. Rhodes din have much to do, neither the other characters except Mr. Stark, who has gelled well into this role.Expected Mandarin to play the part in this one, however it was something else altogether. The villains were too flimsy.. just a lil flashback of how they were created, but no detail into why they were doin it... all the while they are too strong to be defeated, however towards the end, there are many of such fiery villains and are mashed up easily by the army of iron men...Biggest blunder is the way iron man suits get destroyed every now & then, imagine it gets broken in pieces when hit by a truck.. Crap!!!And the end is where it peaks.. the disappointment.. our hero gets the arc removed as he's cured... :(",5,12,23,30 April 2013
Django Unchained," This Django chained me to my seats!!!
","Hail Quentin Tarantino. This one is just helluvawesome. I jus loved every single scene, every single word spoken by all the characters. The detailing was also commendable, I mean the costume & the accent used by the characters. Jamie & Christopher did an exceptional job. I love Leo, so nothing to say abut him... he's the best. The concept, story, script, dialogue & performance are too good. The best from Quentin's workshop till date. He gets the best out of everyone. Credit goes to the people behind the camera. Their effort came out well. Just hope this gets an Oscars. Fingers Crossed. :) Django got style!!!",9,0,1,24 January 2013
