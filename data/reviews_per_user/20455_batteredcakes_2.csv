Insidious: Chapter 2," Thought it would be scarier
","I really thought this movie was going to be so much scarier, the commercial made it seem scary as hell and the first movie was pretty scary to me so I gave the second one a shot. This movie had it's creepiness, scares and great suspense but I guess once I found out the truth about the ghost, it didn't seem too scary to me at all. Really good plot and twists though!! So I gave it a 6 for that but took away stars because I expected so much more, even my little sister was barely scared during the movie. The sad part is that the showing of the title and music with it was scarier and creepier than the whole movie (sounds weird but yeah), we even tried to hurry up and turn off the movie at the end! All in all, this was a good movie if you didn't have high expectations like I did. I'd say to go right ahead and watch it. It has it's creepy and scary moments and the suspense was really great, these people really knew how to build up suspense scenes.",6,0,0,1 April 2014
Drag Me to Hell," Is this a horror comedy?
","This movie was one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. If it was meant to be a horror comedy, then it would fend as OK but just as a horror movie, my god, I really felt like I wasted my time. The whole time I watched it, I laughed and then thought to myself 'What in the...f?', because of how ridiculous this movie was. It was only scary in the sense of the pop-ups but then turned into something laughable!! It was an entertaining movie, I'd say to watch it with friends on a movie night, you'll have a lot of laughs and fun times at how ridiculous this movie is. But don't expect a great horror movie, expect a good-time horror-comedy. (Still not sure if it was meant to be comedic or not).",4,0,2,1 April 2014
