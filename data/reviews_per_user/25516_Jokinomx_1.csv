Antz," Superb animation, Very original.
","We took our nine and ten year olds... they loved it... My wife wasn't enthusiastic about going... but, she conceded it was a very entertaining movie.  We were able to use the movie as a way to show our children the importance of being an individual, yet never forgetting it takes a team effort to achieve great things.",9,0,0,2 October 1998
