The Avengers," A simple, fun, well-made summer movie
","Here's a simple, fun, well-made summer movie. It's not great by any measure, nor does it ever try to be. What it does have is a director who understands that the source material is essentially comic book fluff. None of these characters have the depth that Batman or the X-Men do, but they do have cool powers and cool personalities that make for a decent story and some great action set pieces.The most epic of these sequences takes place in – you'll never guess, never, not in a milllion years – New York City! While the scene lacks originality in location, it does make up for it in sheer excitement. Iron Man goes rocketing around town in spectacular aerial battles with the Chitauri, who are as disposable as the Foot Soldiers from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Hawkeye sits on a perch on top of a building and casually snipes more Chitauri out of the air with his bow and arrow. The Hulk, well, he smashes. His chaotic leaping and random crushing of the puny aliens is spectacular to watch. Oh, and, a few of our good guys end up battling Loki at random points as well.Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/the-avengers/ to read the complete review!",6,3,8,7 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Missing all the intrigue and light hearted fun of its predecessor, Game of Shadows is quite a mess.
","Missing all the intrigue and light hearted fun of its predecessor, Game of Shadows is quite a mess. While fun at times with plenty of jokes and little things to like here and there, it never seems a cohesive whole. More importantly, it never seems like a Sherlock Holmes movie.From the start (actually, before the start) we know who our nemesis is: Professor James Moriarty. A fiendish name accompanied by a wonderfully devilish performance by Jared Harris. That's no problem. What is the problem is that his duel with Holmes seems geared more towards action scenes than a well paced mystery. Holmes fights in slow mo, dodges cannon shells in a forest, is skewered by a large industrial fish hook, and survives a flurry of machine gun fire in a train. This movie is a victim of sequelitis: it knows it has to be bigger and badder, but doesn't know how to do it while keeping the core content the same.Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/ to read the complete review!",6,4,6,13 June 2012
Mission: Impossible III," A much needed action packed kick start after the disaster that was John Woo's MI2
","Cruise's first movie to open after his Oprah chair hopping debacle – which somehow lost him more fans than Brad Pitt's cheating on his wife debacle – was TV mogul J.J. Abram's big splash as a silver screen director. After the disaster that was John Woo's MI2, the MI series needed a kick start and that's exactly what it got in the action packed MI3.All the familiars return including Cruise, Ving Rhames, and wise cracking Simon Pegg. Thrown into the mix is a fiendish Philip Seymour Hoffman as resident terrorist Owen Davian. The plot is simple enough with no real big twists like the original had. But, this is more a summer action fest than DePalma's methodically paced thriller.Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/category/all-movie-reviews/ to read the complete review!",8,1,1,7 June 2012
The Ring," ...grows more and more absurd.
","This is one of those movies that really could have been among the greats in the genre like The Exorcist. The Ring establishes one of the best horror atmospheres that I have ever experienced and it even delivers on the scares that it promises. But, aside from all that is everything that is unforgivable. The entire movie just grows more and more absurd; thought I cannot give any specific examples without making this review a big spoiler, the movie either fails to explain the origins and purpose of the tape and all the mystery surrounding it or gives an explanation that is something more than absurd. Still, I concede that atmosphere is probably the most effective element in a horror movie and The Ring succeeds beyond my wildest dreams on that level. There are no showy special effects, but instead subtle little touches like an eerie cabin near a misty and spooky forest, a quiet farming town with an aura of uneasy silence surrounding it, and most importantly, a woman who changes from an everyday news reporter to a tense and fearful person afraid for the lives of everyone she loves.Still, one of the biggest gripes I had with this movie was the videotape itself. There are a lot of people who seem to think that it was creative and extremely frightening; I am not one of those people. Whoever was responsible for the creation of the videotape footage seemed to create a montage by just throwing together a bunch of individually interesting images that had little effect, especially in the long run. When we see some of the objects on the tape in real life, The Ring wants us to say 'wow,' instead we are left muttering anything but flattery. The tape is the central piece of the movie, something that the audience yearns to see and be frightened by. To me the piecing together of 'artsy' images has become a cliché and an all too easy way out.Another big problem is the ending, or rather, the lack of a good one. There are a few points before the actual end that I thought the movie should have ended; granted that any of the other ending points would have been more typical, any other ending would have stopped the continual onslaught of brainless explanations and commercially injected meaning. There is one point where Watts says, 'I want to go home,' where I definitely would have liked to see the movie end. Yes we've seen it before and yes it's the easy way out that I was complaining the tape footage took, but not everything can be original and not everything has to be original. Horror movies and thrillers these days are still all trying to duplicate the huge plot twist of The Sixth Sense, and the eventual monetary success that the film enjoyed. At some point there has to be a concession that Shyamalan's picture was beyond what almost all people in Hollywood are capable of in terms of its shock value.Luckily, making up for the script's flaws is the talent involved in the cast, especially in Naomi Watts. Her performance as Rachael is often the saving grace of this movie. She transforms otherwise painful moments into something emotionally compelling or frightening. At first look, Watts is the typical attractive female that all horror movies like to showcase either in the main character or in one of the side characters. But she transcends the typical female in a horror movie role and shows us her character's depth and emotions. She starts out as reporter investigating her niece's death to a woman with seven days to live and a son and ex-husband with only a day or so more than her.In the end The Ring is similar to one of this weekend's other releases, Abandon. Both show us some elements of brilliance that are rare in movies of their type, both are bad movies in the end. The Ring is a movie that could have offered more than a few scares and a cool look, but alas, the writer failed to write with logic and reason as is often the case in Hollywood.",6,0,0,4 December 2002
Minority Report," Stunning Visuals and Incredible Story
","The visual image of the future that we get from Spielberg in Minority Report is awe inspiringly jaw dropping. Yeah. It's that good. But the best part about it is that the eye candy is only there to play along with the story, not to dominate it. Recently it seems as though special effects have been the basis for entire movies where as Spielberg understands that the movie should be the basis for the use of special effects. There are some great action sequences in the beginning of the movie including a jet pack sequence and a 'pulse gun' scene; either of which would have been well worth the price of admission. Other details include robotic spiders that can confirm the identity of people in a building in a matter of minutes, cars that glide vertically and horizontally on magnetic strips, mammoth skyscrapers mixed with present day buildings in Washinton D.C., and so many others.Nothing can compare to the computer interface used by pre-crime to find out the details of the killer. The computer takes the visual images from the Pre-Cogs and plays them with a Precrime officer at the controls. The images can be manipulated by the officer with movements almost like a symphony conductor. It's like an enormous even cooler looking iPhone. Except this was about five years before our world was blessed (cursed?) with the device. Aside from that the overall look of the world is near flawless. The gray world makes the CGI animators job easier and allows the world to remain real and tangible for the audience.The story is about Precrime's star cop John Anderton - Tom Cruise in perhaps his finest performance ever. Anderton is a man with many flaws, especially since losing his son in a freak poolside disappearance years ago. He does drugs to make the present bearable all while tracking down (alleged) future murderers. It's all fine and dandy until Anderton is the next suspect the Precogs see killing a random man. He goes on the run to try to clear his name, all while DC's finest try to hunt him down in the futuristic world where it's nearly impossible to hide.Spending hours talking about just the images would be easy, but what really carries this movie is the engrossing story. There are numerous twists and turns, and there are small holes in logic at a few points, but those holes depend on personal opinions and philosophy. It has always been a dilemma to answer the question: 'If you stop something from happening that was supposed to happen, doesn't that mean that it really wasn't supposed to happen anyways?' My biggest problem was this: John's supposed future murder was predicted early which meant it was premeditated, but it actually was not, it happened in the heat of the moment, so how could the Pre-Cogs have predicted it so early?We forget about everything that could be wrong because Tom Cruise is so exciting to watch on screen that nothing else matters sometimes. He is the best action star alive today, but he is also one of the few action stars with highly respectable dramatic talent as well. His turns in Rain Man, Born on the Fourth of July, Magnolia, and Jerry Maguire have all been top notch. He is the perfect choice for John Anderton and his collaboration with Spielberg allows him to get back into the high quality of work that we are used to seeing him in.The supporting cast is extraordinary with standout performances from Max von Sydow - the old and optimistic director of Precrime - Colin Farrell - complex and pessimistic investigator Danny Witwer - and Samantha Morton - Agatha, the most talented Pre-Cog. One of the most memorable lines in the movie comes when Agatha mutters, 'Is this now?' It makes us realize that Agatha seeing the present is just as amazing for her as any one of us seeing the future.There are hundreds of other details, big and small, that make this movie an instant classic. This may sound tacky, but Minority Report shoots for nothing less than perfection, and it succeeds on almost every level.",9,0,0,4 December 2002
Memento," Memento is quite simply the best thriller of all time. This is a completely original backwards thriller with outstanding performances from its entire cast and a screenplay that is unmatched by any other movi
","Note: This is a very difficult movie to review without making it a spoiler, but there is nothing in the following review that will ruin the movie for anyone who has not yet seen it.I had no idea of what this movie was going to be like when I walked into the theatre, but I was hooked from beginning to end. First, the performances by Matrix veterans Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are masterful. Their characters play the audience just like they play Leonard, and that is what makes them so compelling. Pantoliano especially shines here in a performance similar to some of Joe Pesci's academy award caliber work. But the real prize goes to Guy Pearce who really puts himself on the map with a surprisingly sympathetic performance as a man out to get revenge for the murder of his wife. Pearce should have been recognized after his performance in the critically acclaimed L.A. Confidential, but he still remained in the dark due to the box office mediocrity of that film. Here we get to see his true potential in a role that should at least nab him a best actor Oscar nomination if not a win.Additional praise MUST be given to Christopher Nolan who both wrote and directed this film, which was spawned from a short story written by his brother, Jonathan Nolan. Christopher's first film, a black and white piece called `The Following' (another must see film), displayed that he was a director with infinite potential. With Memento Nolan not only shows that he is for real, but also establishes himself as one of the premiere screenwriters and directors of the new generation.We see Nolan's effect from the first scene of the movie: a brilliant shot of a Polaroid fading instead of developing. But this is just a taste of things to come in this backwards movie. After it is completely faded, the picture pops back into Leonard's camera and the entire opening scene plays backwards ending with Leonard shooting Teddy in the head. Throughout the rest of the movie, Nolan uses his color scenes to represent elements starting from the `end' and going backwards in time and he uses black and white to start at the `beginning' and go forward in time. Confused yet? Well, if that's not enough, the black and white scenes and the color scenes actually merge into one in the end of the movie so the final scene can finally piece together this intriguing and complex puzzle. Additionally, the color scenes overlap with each other and we have more and more revealed to us with each scene. This is technically the opposite of Leonard's experience, yet at the same times it allows us to feel exactly how Leonard feels because we are slowly given information until the end when everything comes together.
I realize that what I said above may have been more than confusing, but that is how this movie plays out. Most viewers will need to see it at least twice to get the full experience of what Memento has to offer, and most viewers will also want to watch it a third, fourth, fifth, etc. time. This movie truly gets better with each viewing because you pick up new elements along the way each time. Personally, I picked up more on the `Sammy Jenkis' story. Sammy was a man that Leonard liked to talk about because also had a short-term memory problem. I did not fully understand the meaning behind this story until I saw it my second time, but Sammy Jenkis is just the tip of the iceberg. You won't be disappointed in the least bit unless you only see this movie once.",10,2,4,22 August 2002
Hostel," Better than expected, truly frightening
","Grade: B-Not as gory as you might expect, but more psychologically disturbing than anything in recent memory. The first thirty or so minutes play more like a porno than a horror movie (though I suppose the two could often be confused for lack of quality) as three college kids pursue sex and drugs in, where else, but Amsterdam. The very idea behind Hostel is terrifying enough to keep the viewers attention. Once the torture begins, director Eli Roth doesn't stop. To say he creates tension is inaccurate. This isn't Hitchcock. Still, Roth focuses more on the anticipation of pain than in the pain itself. Often he shies away from showing us the torture: we don't see the drill going into the flesh, we don't see the ankles being slashed, but we know what's happening and that is even more terrifying. Hostel is still a horror movie with bad dialogue and useless characters, which is why giving it a 'B-' is a little generous. It gets the grade because I left the theater thinking about the images and the situation: people being Kidnapped on vacation to be torture subjects for those who can pay for it. That's enough to keep me from backpacking Europe anytime soon.",6,4,7,11 May 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Too much bad to go along with the good
","Grade: B-Brokeback Mountain is a brave and daring movie that wisely doesn't focus on its controversial nature. This is a story about an unconventional love. The movie is quiet and simple, like its main character Ennis Del Mar. The biggest problems are that the performances and characters are the strongest points of the movie, not the screenplay and plot. Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams both give great performances well worth of the praise they are receiving. Jake Gyllenhall is very underrated. His character, Jack, is more outgoing, not as subtle or complicated as Ennis. The first act of the movie, until Ennis and Jack get together, is very slow. There are numerous shots and scenes with no purpose that really detract from what the movie could have been. All in all, Brokeback Mountain is good, but it's certainly not the best movie of the year.",6,3,30,11 May 2006
Silent Hill," Absolutely Horrendous
","Grade: D- (2 out of 10) Only if the movie were as good as the poster.Only if the movie were as good as the poster. Silent Hill does about as much wrong as a movie can do. Really, the only good things I remember are the cinematography and the music. The acting is horrendous, and I'm judging on a horror-movie level here, so it was really bad. Radha Mitchell is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. She was horrible in Man on Fire, and she's even worse here. She doesn't even have a chilling scream. Isn't that the prereq for getting a part in a horror movie? Her saving grace was that everyone else was so bad, so after a while I just got used to it.Here's a plot overview: There is a kid that is a little bit crazy. She runs off in her sleep and says 'Silent Hill.' Mom, Rose, takes kid to creepy ghost town called Silent Hill that she found on the internet (damn you internet and damn you mapquest). Things go very wrong in the ghost town.That's really all I understood from the plot. If you're like me and haven't played the games, you won't understand a single thing in the movie. From what I've gathered, even if you have religiously played the games you'll be pretty confused. Silent Hill cops out by using 10 minutes of exposition towards the very end to try to explain the entire movie. The problem is that by that point I really didn't care, it still didn't make sense, and the movie could have dropped hints along its excruciating two plus hour running length to make the rest of it more bearable. The strange thing is that by the end I wanted less explanation and more...well, I really just wanted it to end.The entire first hour and a half could have easily been condensed into about thirty effective minutes (and that's being generous with the time). It didn't help that there was a completely useless subplot involving Chris, Rose's husband. The only reason Chris was added in the first place was because the screenplay initially had no male characters in it. Great job Hollywood producers: green-light a crappy video-game-based movie, and then find ways to make it even worse. Bravo.Granted the screenplay, especially the dialog, is downright laughable. Horror movies always have bad dialog, but usually its bad and funny. In Silent Hill, not so much. For example: Cybil: 'They say this place used to be haunted.' Rose: 'I'd say they were right.' I admit, I did giggle at that one, but there is much worse. In fact the dialog might be the only thing scary enough to make you jump out of your seat. There isn't a single jump-out-of-your seat fright or, more importantly, moment of tension in the entire movie (unless you find break dancing zombie-like things frightening). There are some loud noises, lots of darkness, and some neat special effects, but that's about it. There's plenty of violence and gore for the horror fans, but almost all of it is towards the end. Though there is a part towards the middle where a young girl has her skin ripped off her body that woke me up along with the rest of the theater...and I'm not even a fan of gore.The movie was so bad that the people sitting next to me passing comments at the movie were much more entertaining than the actual movie. Don't get me wrong, I think that talking in a movie is a cardinal sin punishable only by the most powerful, deepest, darkest hellfire. These people deserve praise, not punishment, for entertaining me for free because I surely wasn't being entertained by the movie I paid $7 for (heck, $14 if you count my bored out of her mind girlfriend).From what I hear, the game requires a quick trigger finger, but also a good amount of brains and puzzle solving skills. Ironically the movie is a brainless puzzle that isn't worth solving even if there is an answer. I can guarantee this will be on my bottom five of 2006 list; through April it's the worst I've seen yet.",1,1,4,23 April 2006
Lilo & Stitch," ...worthy of the Disney name
","Lilo and Stitch was worthy of the Disney name that spawned the most glorious age of hand drawn animation. I must concede that I am a Disney Freak. I am a big fan of the movies, theme parks, collectible items, and other such things. Still, I like to think of myself as an objective reviewer because I do not like everything that Disney throws at the big screen, especially more recently. Lilo and Stitch did have a tendency to get over emotional and corny at times by trying to pound in the theme that 'Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind.' This statement was repeated over and over by our protagonists throughout the movie. Is it important? Sure. The lesson for youngings is to never to give up on someone because they are different and that family is very important. Aside from the traditional themes, this movie was a fun kids movie whose tone was just right for its target audience.Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/lilo-and-stitch/ to read the complete review!",7,1,1,4 December 2002
Batman Begins," Batman Begins is quite simply the greatest comic book movie ever made
","Batman Begins is quite simply the greatest comic book movie ever made, and one of the greatest films ever made. With the trilogy now completed, it's appropriate and easy to look back and realize the full brilliance of the film. The introduction of Ra's Al Ghul and The League of Shadows as the villains allowed the final chapter to feature Bane in a plot that came full circle. To know Bruce, Alfred, and Gordon at the beginning of their careers allowed us to appreciate Bruce transforming into Batman, Alfred's growing father figure role, and Gordon's climb to commissioner.The plot is complex. When Bruce witnesses his parents' death, he travels to Asia to learn about the criminal underworld. Along the way he meets Ducard and The League of Shadows who train him in the ways of ninja. Bruce escapes The League after learning of their plans to destroy Gotham. He returns to Gotham and takes on the alter ego of Batman to fight crime and return Gotham from the cesspool of criminals that rule the city.The hero origin story has been seriously overplayed over the past 10 years. They're a dime a dozen and follow the same arc. What makes Batman more compelling than the others is that he's just a human that actively acquires his powers. He wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider, or shipped off from Krypton, or born as the God of Thunder. He's a tortured soul who finds relief in this alter ego he creates. The story of Batman isn't about Bruce Wayne, it's about Batman.Batman Begins does the best job of showcasing the central character whereas TDK focused heavily on The Joker and TDKR on Bane and Lieutenant Blake. Christopher Nolan's touch is on every element of every frame. There's a scene after Bruce returns to Gotham where he has to act like he's having fun running around town in his sports car with European Supermodels. Leaving a party at a hotel, he runs into his oldest friend, Rachel Dawes. He tries to convince her that what she sees isn't him, but it's all for naught as the women in the background yell 'We have some more hotels for you to buy.' Nolan decides to drown out the sound, choreographed perfectly with the visuals as the sharp focus is on Bruce's tortured face, with the car and women heavily blurred in the background. It's one of the greatest shots ever captured.Director of Photography Wally Pfister deserves much of the accolades. He frames Gotham in an almost sepia hue without the Instagram cheesiness. It works to showcase this the poverty and depression of the city yet give it a very comic book feel. This may be a realistic version of Batman, but it is still Batman. Much has been made of the action sequences being the largest weakness of the film. I agree that the hand- to-hand combat scenes are disappointingly weak. They're shot too close and edited too choppy. The rest of the action, mainly the Batmobile chase sequence, is skillfully handled. The fear in Bruce's voice channels to the audience as Rachel fades further and further from reality after being blasted with Scarecrow's fear toxin.For the aforementioned chase, Nolan relied on no visual effects, even as the Batmobile flew across rooftops and through narrow underground roads. Nolan found a sort of empty playground in Chicago's upper and lower Wacker Drive that allowed for the chase to come to life as realistically as possible.Much of the realism is thanks to the incredible cast. There's no over the top scene stealing actors here. There is terrifying amounts of talent. Christian Bale is the perfect choice to play the dark, brooding Batman and emotionally detached playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne. One of my favorite actors, Michael Caine, plays his butler/confidant/father figure, Alfred. Caine is so detailed that he gives Alfred just a slightly different tinge of his cockney British accent so as to be more appropriate for a butler. The cast is filled out with pitiful lesser actors like God, a.k.a. Morgan Freeman, perennial bad ass Liam Neeson, accent chameleon Gary Oldman, and ol' blue eyes Cillian Murphy.Aside from the action scenes the biggest complaint has been the casting of Katie Holmes. After seeing TDK, I'm sure a lot of people wanted Mrs. Holmes back. The truth is that much of her negative press was centered around the Tom Cruise Scientology scandal. The character of Rachel Dawes was one of the weaker points of the first two films. Holmes isn't to blame. If anything she held her own against some of the greatest names in the industry.Begins plays much like a great gangster film with all the right hints of comic book fantasy. Even if TDK and TDKR were never made, Batman Begins exists fully in its own skin. There is the Joker cliffhanger at the end, but you don't feel like the rest of the movie was setting you up just for the cliffhanger like every other big blockbuster these days. It's these subtle differences and detailed touches that make each frame of this movie such an absolute wonder to behold.For more reviews like this one as well as other movie musings, go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/",10,1,2,21 July 2005
Bridesmaids," One of the best comedies of the 21st century
","Bridesmaids is one of the best comedies of the 21st century along with Borat and About A Boy. What carries it above most comedies is that it's actually well written. Our main character, Anne, played by the comic genius Kristen Wiig, has many flaws. Being an out of work baker, her life is in a tough spot so she takes her Maid of Honor duties quite seriously. Being Lillian's (Maya Rudolph) best friend is the best thing she has going.

X-Men: The Last Stand," disappointing, but exciting
","Billed as the third and final chapter of the X-Men trilogy, The Last Stand is a different kind of movie than the first two. Fans of the comics and fans of the previous films will be united in their disappointment in what really isn't a bad movie. The biggest problem with X3 isn't the plot but the execution and pace. There are two ways to look at the film: (1) this movie should be a good movie on it's own, independent of the previous two (which it is not on any accounts), or (2) this is the third act of one big epic movie (ala Lord of the Rings), and in this way it is very successful.The plot is relatively simple: there is a cure for mutancy, and a debate rages over whether or not such a cure is ethical. Magneto and his brotherhood of mutants find that the source of the cure is a mutant child who is housed in Alcatraz (hence the ripping of the Golden Gate Bridge off it's hinges in the preview). The X-Men aren't really for or against the cure, but they don't believe that destroying the cure and waging a war against the humans is the right answer. During all this Jean Grey comes back as Dark Phoenix and wreaks havoc on those who oppose her. New director Brett Ratner seems scared to touch on any of the serious issues that his predecessor, Bryan Singer, introduced and explored. There's often a beginning and an end, but no middle, no substance. Rogue's role is diminished to answering one question: should she take the cure so she can finally touch and kiss her boyfriend (and anyone else for that matter)? Now that's a deep, serious question to answer. The problems is that the depth of exploration is limited to one speech from Wolverine, and her final decision. In a movie that runs a trim 103 minutes (a whole 30 minutes shorter than the previous film), you would think that a little more time could have been devoted to the characters and the issues that face them. Instead there is a great deal of time spent on things that go boom.That being said, the things that go boom are breathtaking. Not only are the action sequences visually astounding, but so is the rest of the movie. Almsot every second of every scene is infused with an air of mysticism and visual beauty that is rare in movies today. In the gigantic action sequences, Ratner does a great job successfully tugging on our heart strings as many of our beloved mutants either lose their powers or lose their lives. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire last action scene where Magneto rips the Golden Gate Bridge off its very hinges and crashes it down on Alcatraz. In all, X3 is a highly entertaining movie that uses its visuals very effectively, but it falls short on becoming a great movie like X2 because it shies away from aiming from greatness. An X-Fan like myself can't help but be at least a little disappointed. By the way, you should stay for the short (really, really short) clip at the end of the credits. It's well worth the wait.",6,0,1,13 June 2006
Brave," A Brave New Film From Pixar
","There's quite a bit about Brave that has marked it as a departure from Pixar's typical fare. The most memorable trailer was one of the best scenes from the movie, with Merida protesting her marriage by shooting for her own hand. That scene alone showcases the detail and quality of animation we've come to expect from Pixar. No other studio has managed to come near what they do. The motion of the characters is natural. Merida's gorgeous curly red hair is distracting in its details only at the perfect times. And, most impressively, when Merida holds her breath to shoot her last arrow the audience holds its collective breath as we watch her arrow shoot away in slow motion and in a beautiful use of depth of field that reminds us why 2D is still highly preferred to 3D.That's not to say Brave is quite as visually astonishing as Sully's fur in Monsters Inc., the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo, or a landfill laden Earth in Wall-E. But, in some ways, it's not meant to be. We're dealing with a primarily human cast for once, and ones meant to look very different than the ones in Up.Beyond the animation, the story is somewhat flat. The trailers do an excellent job of concealing the twists, but the twists are all easy to see well ahead of time. The story revolves around Princess Merida who is continually at odds with her Mother, Elinor. At the center of their arguments: marriage. Merida is to be married to the first born of one of the leaders of the other three clans. She'll have none of it as she'd much rather ride off on her own and perfect her archery skills than sit at home and be a proper Princess. In her more childish qualities, she's like her father: an overgrown warrior child who also happens to be King. It's not a bad story, but it's certainly a little too basic. Most people will most likely find the lack of creativity in the script's details the biggest disappointment in Brave. There's no moments where we marvel 'how did these guys come up with this?' It's a pity because Merida is one of the best protagonists Pixar has been blessed with. She's likable and hate-able in all the right ways. She has quite a bit of bratty teenager in her - as evidenced by the lack of morality she displays in trying to change her mother's mind about her upcoming betrothal - and yet heaps of bravery - as she shows when confronted with what she's done to her Mother. The best part about Merida and the story is that she's the one continually driving it forward and making the choices. That proves vital as the film doesn't really have a villain. This isn't a good vs. evil battle like all their other movies not named Finding Nemo.Brave falls somewhere in the middle for Pixar. It's great that it's original (especially with Pixar selling out and giving us Monster's Inc. 2 and Toy Story 4 shortly), it's great the protagonist is female and so well rounded, and it's great the animation is somewhat subdued for once. I can't help but feel that Brave lacks some of the magic and creativity that really separate the upper echelon of Pixar's best work from the rest of it. Of course, that'll still probably be enough to make it the best animated movie of the year.For more reviews like this one as well as other movie musings, go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/",7,21,37,24 June 2012
8 Mile," Finally, a movie with a music star that's not just not bad, it's actually very good.
","The entire cast and crew did such an excellent job with this movie that it could have easily been the best movie of the year if Scott Silver's script hadn't messed up a thing or two here and there. Finally, a movie with a music star that's not just not bad, it's actually very good.The discussion first starts with, who else, Eminem. He has come under some scrutiny because he is playing a character that is very loosely based on himself. Because of this, everyone seems ready to brush off his performance as either 'ok,' or, 'pretty good.' There are two big things that disturb me about that. First, didn't Adam Sandler just get heaps of praise for playing a slight deviation from his normal characters in Punch-Drunk Love? Many seemed to think that it was the best performance of the year. And second, and most importantly, if anyone can name me just one other person - actor, director, music star, or anything else - that could have played Rabbit, please, let me know. There is not a rapper with as much talent in his lyrics or his rhymes as Eminem, so there is not another soul on this planet that could have played Rabbit (and if anyone E-Mail's me with the suggestion that Vanilla Ice could have done it, please, go find some help for yourself). Because of all this, Eminem gives one of the best performances this year. He is emotionally charged and you can tell that without him this would have been a bad movie. I don't know if it's because he's one of the biggest music stars in the world or something else, but he has a screen presence that is huge and magnetic.The rest of the cast holds their own. Mekhi Phifer is easily the standout as Future, Rabbit's best friend. I didn't know much about Phifer before this movie, but he is definitely a promising talent. He never tries to take over a scene from Eminem; he knows he is on the side to play Rabbit's best friend and advisor. The women in the movie are played down quite a bit. Basinger who last won an Oscar when working with director Curtis Hanson, won't be getting one this time around, but she does what she can with her screen time. We love and hate her as Rabbit's mother and I think that she does a good job of playing the typical trailer mom. A lot of critics seemed to think she was too beautiful to play the character. This is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard. Are these people honestly saying that there are no good looking people at all in trailers? Obviously, since all the rich higher class people are so beautiful. The other major female role is Rabbit's girlfriend, Alex, played by Brittany Murphy. Honestly, I'm as familiar with Murphy as I am with Phifer. Her character was the weakest one out of the bunch. We never got to know her at all, and I don't know if it's even correct to call her Rabbit's girlfriend. All they did was fool around once and we are expected to like her and take her words of wisdom to heart. Note to Scott Silver: don't put in a love interest just because you think there should be a love interest in the movie. Murphy herself is attractive, but not much more. She doesn't get to test her acting chops as much as she may have liked to.Now, the movie itself has some scenes that will blow you away. The very beginning is one of the best opening sequences I've ever seen. The very first shots show Rabbit standing in front of a mirror preparing for a battle. He looks at himself as if his reflection is the enemy, he makes fierce rapping hand gestures at himself and goes through all the lyrics he can think of in his head - analogous of a boxer waiting in the wings before a fight. The battles are all incredible; a battle is a duel between rappers where they each get 45 seconds to trade insults. In the end, the winner is judged by the roar from the crowd. The battles are easily the highlight of the movie because of their originality and their capability to take the movie onto another level all together. There are official battles hosted by Future and everyday battles at work or on the street, both of which work in their own ways. It is incredible how these insult trading sessions of freestyle rap can completely engulf you into the world of 1995 Detroit. I immediately understood that these insults were not personal, that they were a way of fighting without physically beating the hell out of each other (though there is a decent bit of that too outside of the battles). Every time Rabbit was one of the performers the energy just shot though the roof and my eyes and ears were at full alert. There is one scene in particular during a lunch break at Rabbit's job where a girl raps about the hardships and unfair treatment they get at their job. A man responds and puts her down, seemingly winning the battle before Rabbit steps in and puts him in his place. And then there is the final battle; it definitely does not disappoint. Each rapper gets a 90 seconds and  Rabbit gets to go first. He tells the crowd everything that his opponent is going to say about him from white jokes to cracks about living in a trailer with his mom, and then he goes on to decimate away his opponent and his entire gang.Another vital element of this movie is the settings. Hanson wisely chose to shoot in Detroit rather than cut costs and go across the border into Canada. Hanson now has an even more impressive resume adding 8 Mile to L.A. Confidential, Wonder Boys, and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle. The eerie run down image of 1995 Detroit is both realistic and visually wonderful. Hanson has always been known for being able to capture the essence of a large city well with Pittsburgh and L.A. being the settings for his last two movies. Will someone just give this man an award? He is one of the most consistently brilliant directors right now but his commercial draw is almost irrelevant, especially when compared to names like Soderbergh or Shyamalan. Though he is a less impressive screenwriter (what was he thinking with A Knight's Tale?), no one can question his talent as a director.For 8 Mile, although the script seemed to be left up to Eminem for the most important exchanges, Silver had a good message at heart. Instead of having the typical rags to riches story, he instead takes the approach of showing a young man who is going to work through his hardships and earn enough money to make it big himself without some multi-million dollar record deal coming out of the blue. After the final battle Rabbit goes back to his job where he has worked hard to earn extra shifts and make more money. In a sense it's anti-climactic, but it is abrupt and doesn't dwell on itself for long enough to bring the movie down from it's climax. Instead, it strikes the right tone as the movie fades out to the best song of the year (for a movie or otherwise) 'Lose Yourself.' I don't think a song has ever captured an entire movie and it's themes as well as 'Lose Yourself,' and there may never be another song quite like it. Will Eminem get an invite to the Oscars? Don't bet on it, but it's not like the Academy ever gets it right anyways.As I left this movie I felt myself wanting to go to a real life battle, and if I weren't fearful for my life I may have done that. I got the same feeling coming out of 8 Mile as I did coming out of The Legend of Bagger Vance. Coming out of the latter, I wanted nothing more than to go play golf all alone on a beautiful serene golf course. Coming out of the former I wanted to be Rabbit - a poet from the ghetto who can work magic with his lyrics off the top of his head.",8,1,1,4 December 2002
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Disappointing Visuals and Poor Directoral Decisions.
","I did not have high expectations going in because the trailer did not look that great to me. Still, I was disappointed by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. There were some funny moments, decent visuals, and Johnny Depp was incredible as always, but at the end of the movie I just did not feel anything.First of all, and for the bazillionth time, this is not a remake of the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. They are both inspired by the same novel from Roald Dahl, but this version claims to be more faithful to the novel (which it's not). There is a lot I disliked about the movie, so here's a quick, yet descriptive, list of things: 1. Willy Wonka was 'given a point.' However, Charlie says 'Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy.' Along the same lines, Willy Wonka doesn't need to have a point, but director Burton and writer August felt the need to make him more human for some reason.2. The Oompa Loompa's were all one person (Deep Roy). They were creepy instead of cute and fun. There was no reason to have them all look the same.3. Along those lines, the songs (except the Willy Wonka theme song) were horrendous. They were all like short acid trips. Then again, everything after the first 25 minutes was like a long acid trip.4. It was visually bland for a Tim Burton film. It doesn't even look as good as the 1971 film. Everything looked like sets out of a Disney ride like A Small World. What happened to the guy that directed Batman and Edward Scissorhands? I'm not saying use CGI, but get a better set designer at least.5. At the beginning the narrator declares that the story is about Charlie, and the movie is called CHARLIE and the Chocolate Factory. It turns out that Willy Wonka is the main focus and Charlie is just there to guide Wonka along his character arc. In fact, Charlie doesn't have any character flaws at all. I cannot recall what is flaw was in the book, but in the original Charlie and his Grandfather disobey Wonka and have the fizzy lifting drinks. It is Charlie's basic good nature that then redeems him for his misbehavior.6. Danny Elfman, what happened man? Normally a fine composer, this score ranks as one of the worst I've heard in recent memory.So, by now you're probably wondering, why did he give this movie a C+ instead of a D? Well, there were a few unexpected saving graces in the form of Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore who plays Charlie. Charlie is the main character through the first 25 or so minutes of the film, but once we enter the chocolate factory Burton chooses to keep Charlie at an arm's length for some reason. Luckily, Highmore, who was great with Depp in Finding Neverland, is a good enough actor to keep us intrigued until he finds the golden ticket.Once in the factor, Charlie virtually disappears beside Johnny Depp's much publicized creepy Michael Jackson imitation a.k.a. Willy Wonka. Aside from the high pitched voice and the pale face, there's really no Michael in this Wonka. Depp is famous for giving us memorable oddball characters and this one is no different. Is he creepy? Sure, but he's supposed to be. Wonka's weirdness is the only thing that kept me sane in the chocolate factory.At the end of the day I was most dissatisfied because there was no magic. Every good kid's film needs to have something magical about it. I don't just mean that warm ooey gooey feeling inside from a happy ending, I mean that feeling you have after seeing movies like Beauty and the Beast or more recently, Finding Nemo. I realize that a live action children's film lives by different rules than animation, but that didn't stop movies like A Little Princess or even Willy Wonka from becoming classics.If you have to see this movie, at least wait for it on DVD. There's no reason to go to the IMAX or your local neighborhood theater and empty your wallet for something as hollow as this.",5,1,3,21 July 2005
The Last Samurai," The Best Film of the Year
","Where to start? Well, lets scratch the surface by talking about the obvious commercial draw of the film: Tom Cruise. This is Cruise's best film in a long career filled with great films. Here, Cruise is able to utilize his unparalleled action skills and showcase his underappreciated acting talent as Captain Nathan Algren. I have always believed Cruise to be one of the best actors in Hollywood; he is the only action star to put so much effort into each and every scene he does. In Samurai, he is surrounded by an equally talented cast headlined by Asian cinema star Ken Watanabe. Watanabe's performance as Katsumoto is one of the best this year and his chemistry with Cruise is incredible. Katsumoto is a man who demands respect with his looks, but obtains it through his actions. Lets put the performances aside for just a second. The overall look of the film is beautiful. Granted, to most western audiences any movie set in the Orient has beautiful scenery, but Samurai doesn't try to just showcase Japan's grand landscapes. Instead, the scenery flows effortlessly into each and every scene and compliments it. Even further complimenting the look of the movie are the simple yet beautiful sets. I cannot comment on the historical authenticity of the sets having only been to Japan once, but regardless the small, simple Japanese homes are adorned with vastly different personalities in each individual room. The transition between the simple Samurai life and the hectic battle scenes is perfect. Some will complain about the shakiness of the camera at times and that the shots are cut to quickly. Even I had that complaint at small parts here and there, but that's how a battle is: hectic, random, and unpredictable. The battles are among the most epic ever filmed, paralleled only perhaps by those in Braveheart. There are a few fight sequences that had the audience, including myself, applauding afterwards. The most well choreographed in terms of swordplay is one that will have the nerds inside many of us bubbling with joy. Just know this: Ninjas vs. Samurai. Usually when you have a western actor in a role that requires eastern skill (ala Keanu Reeves as Neo), there is huge disappointment among the masses. In this case a man like Cruise has worked his ass off so much that his mastery of a katana blade is as good as Watanabe's or anyone else's. Granted, I'd still put my money on someone like Watanabe in an off screen skirmish, but onscreen the two are equals as warriors. Reverting back to the Ninja vs. Samurai scene, the music is similar to the fast drum beats of Yo-Yo Ma in the first fight sequence of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. At the end of the scene my pulse was as high as ever and my jaw was wide open. The quickness and ferocity of the show that Zwick and the fight choreographers will not back down just because this movie is meant primarily for mainstream America. Almost as if to poke fun at that, there is a short but equally heart-pounding sequence where Algren kills a number of Japanese agents with swords. Initially, the scene is showed in real time, but it pauses after, goes back to the beginning of the sequence, and shows everything in slow motion. It actually means to show Algren's reflection or recollection of the fight that just occurred, but the fact that it works on the two aforementioned levels is even more inspiring. The inevitable final battle sequence is just as good mainly because it doesn't follow any of the common clichés found in other epic war films. Enough about the battles, the real brilliance of this film comes from its short and sharp dialogue and its patient but captivating pacing. The biggest surprise I found was that there were not corny dialogues or lines in the entire movie. Usually movies that showcase words like 'honor' in their trailers have a cheesy scene somewhere in the movie. In Samurai, ideas and themes like honor and courage are practiced, not talked about. There are no speeches, only dialogues. Characters we don't like strike a chord as much as the protagonists. There is a point in the movie when Algren is leaving to go back to the Samurai when his commanding officer (Col. Bagley) asks him 'what is it about your own people that you hate so much?' There is no answer from Algren, which makes the question and the point it tries to make all the more chilling. The most impressive dialogue is that written for the Japanese characters, particularly the samurai. Japanese characters consistently talk to each other in Japanese, and Algren eventually learns Japanese instead of vice-versa. The samurai dialogue never lapses into the typical 'dumb foreigner' dialogue that just about every Hollywood movie showcases these days. Instead, the script, penned by John Logan and Marshall Herskovitz, treats Japanese just as importantly as English, and the Japanese just as important as the Americans. A few things both in and out of the screenplay that I appreciated about the film were the realism of injury and the patience and confidence to let the story unfold by itself. At about an hour-and-a-half, Samurai isn't a second too long or a second too short. It owes this to gorgeous editing and directing which allows the movie to start slowly and then take off when Algren reaches Japan. I mention the realism of injury because our main characters are constantly stabbed or shot and actually take time to heal. Algren himself is nearly killed in the initial encounter with the Samurai, and he is shot and stabbed numerous times in the final scene. A substantial part of the movie deals with his rehabilitation at the Samurai town. So, do I have any complaints at all? No. Upon second viewing maybe I'll find something that could have been a little better. Maybe the beginning could have been a little more interesting. Maybe the action could have been just a little less choppy. I don't know, but for now The Last Samurai is as great as epic filmmaking gets. It represents everyone at the top of their game with the utmost confidence in their artistic abilities. Cruise shows why he has consistently been Hollywood's leading man over the past two decades, and the cast of Asian stars and unknowns doesn't flinch for a second. Most people cringe to mention any movie as comparable in brilliance to Kurosawa, but Samurai places itself in those lofty ranks. This isn't just the best movie I've seen this year, it is one of the best movies I have seen from the past decade.
Grade: A+ (only one every few years) IMDB Rating: 10/10",8,1,2,1 December 2003
The Da Vinci Code," Boring, but much better than the book
","Grade: C The best way to sum The DaVinci Code up is: boring. The movie plots along with our characters rushing from point to point, much like the book. The only difference is that director Ron Howard and his crew are much better filmmakers than Dan Brown is a writer. Unfortunately, the source material is so bland that the resulting film has a climax that is about as jarring as finding out whether a flipped coin landed heads or tails.The plot of the movie stays relatively close to the book. Few changes are made, and none of them are significant enough to mention. Robert Langdon is invited to the Louvre by French Police Captain Fache to help solve the murder of the curator. He soon learns that he is the main suspect for the murder. French cryptographer Sophie Neveu rescues him and together they go on a long, long, long journey with many, many, many clues that leads to a discovery that contradicts major Christian beliefs. As you may have already guessed, the movie was too long. The pacing for the 149 minutes is painfully slow. Even the beginning, which was the only reason I read the book in the first place, turns out to be passive. It's as if Howard wants to skip the initial event and jump right into the mystery. Not a bad idea, but it's not executed well. Howard does a good job of translating the scholarly historical information (remember, it's fiction, a.k.a. fake, a.k.a. made up) into eye popping visuals. In the same manner Howard showed us the way Nash saw the world in A Beautiful Mind, he shows us how Robert Langdon solves puzzles by just looking at them. Sadly, Langdon isn't Nash. Langdon is a character without flaws, except maybe for sporting the always fashionable mullet. Once one of the great actors of his generation, Tom Hanks has apparently taken to the one-dimensional main characters (remember Viktor Navorski from The Terminal?). There is a ton of talent wasted here from the adorable Audrey Tautou to the always incredible Jean Reno. Why did all these famous and talented actors waste their time on a movie like this?Luckily, Sir Ian McKellen saves the day as usual. His upbeat and complex portrayal of Sir Leigh Teabing gives the movie the swift kick in the ass it needs before falling flat on its face. Before Teabing, our characters plot along from location to location, clue to clue. A good mystery shows the audience the finish line so the audience can give a damn about what is going on. If it doesn't do that, it gives us characters we should care about along each step of the way. The DaVinci Code does neither. Teabing leads Robert and Sophie on a quest that has an end in sight, even if we don't know exactly what it is. He gives the movie a much needed structure and his short lecture really sets up the mystery (even if it is about half-way into the movie). Now, what about the big controversy about what the movie is about? Quite frankly if you're somewhat educated and you think that this movie is anything but fiction, you're probably going to die tripping over your own feet sometime very soon. I understand the controversy because the controversial 'facts' are presented as just that: facts. I don't want to spoil anything by getting too into the specifics, but it deals with Jesus and whether or not he had a wife. Those who are poorly educated (which is a large part of the worldwide movie going population) can mistake what the movie presents as actual fact. Thus the movie has been banned in countries like India and China and edited beyond recognition in others. At the end of the day the movie will be successful because the book was successful. Millions of people gobbled it up because it was 'entertaining.' I ask for a little more from entertainment than a fake history lesson. Heck, it would have helped to at least be a good fake history lesson.",5,0,3,13 June 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Absolutely terrible
","Grade: D-A harsh grade deserves a very thorough explanation and I aim to deliver nothing less. But, let me begin by outlining what I liked about Reloaded. The action scenes were entertaining for the most part though no where near as breathtaking as the first movie. I actually have more complaints about the action than praise, but I'll get to that in a moment. The special effects were incredible even if they were unnecessary. This is where Reloaded is most comparable to Clones: it decides to use every last penny of it's huge budget (about $300 million for Reloaded and Revolutions) even if it means sacrificing the quality of the film. The masses will undoubtedly disagree with me and that's fine. I have no interest in accepting an action scene simply because it has a lot of explosions, effects, and 'cool' camera angles. If you want to see well crafted sci-fi action scenes, see the original Matrix or better yet, see the underrated and underexposed Equilibrium.Back on the subject though, I have no praise to hand out to the rest of the film except that Keanu Reeves doesn't have to mutter things like 'I know kung-fu.' The dialogue is probably my biggest complaint about the movie. The characters talk completely different in this movie than in its predecessor. Not only that, they talk in prose as if someone out of Philosophy 101 tried to write Shakespeare. The first and most important rule of dialogue that a movie screenwriter must abide by is to keep dialogue as a two way conversation whenever possible; the Wachowski's have completely ignored this and damaged their film beyond repair. Talking philosophically is not a problem nor is having a monologue a couple times in a movie, but the dialogue tired me out after the first few scenes. There is almost no doubt in my mind that The Matrix was not written as a trilogy. Forget what we see, the basic style and attention to detail in this script is miles away from the original.There are also many characters thrown into the mix. We learn close to nothing about all of them, and they either die or remain inconsequential throughout the movie. Interestingly and eventually appallingly, a great portion of the characters in this movie are African American. What's wrong with that by itself? Nothing obviously except that they are exploited so obviously in this movie because the generation fueling this movie (sadly, mine) automatically associates black with cool. I would be offended by this whether I was a person of color or not. There's an almost orgy like party intertwined with a scene with Neo and Trinity having sex that is completely out of place. At that point my friends and I were wondering if we were even in the right movie. I don't come to see Reloaded for a dance club scene with terrible techno music. The music from the first movie was great, the music throughout this one was outright laughable, especially during the freeway sequence.That brings us to the highly praised action sequences that apparently raise the bar of the original set four years ago. The action sequences would be fine if they were just shot separate from anything else, but they each play like an individual trailer for the movie. Every single action sequence in this movie has no sense of urgency, but most importantly no passion. Also, all action scenes are set up; a personal pet peeve. I don't mind set up action scenes in something like a Jet Li movie where you go just to see Jet kick some major ass, but in something that is supposed to be as intelligent as The Matrix, it's disappointing and offensive. The reason the action scenes carry no urgency is that the outcome of the scene is obvious no matter who is fighting. Neo cannot die since he is 'The One' so all the action with Neo is basically just him kicking Agent ass whether there are three or thirty to fight.The already deemed classic freeway scene was a huge letdown for me. First, about 99% of the cars on the freeway were from the 300 that GM donated to the movie, which is me just being picky about a movie I already loathed. More importantly, cars were being destroyed left and right for no purpose; all  300 of those donated cars were gone by the time the scene was over. Another waste of time and money was the freeway built just for this movie. Truly skilled directors (Spielberg comes to mind) would be able to find a way around building their own freeway. The greatest movie chase sequences have always come on normal roads without relentless destruction (remember Ronin, The French Connection, or The Transporter?). The only parts of the freeway scene that got my heart pumping was when Trinity was weaving her bike in and out of traffic to avoid agents and anytime the ghost-like twins were on screen (which was not nearly enough).Last but not least is the hand to hand combat choreographed by the legendary Yuen Wo Ping. Again, the combat itself is impressive, but actually dull after sometime. I am probably the last person on this planet who would admit to any form of kung-fu being dull, but it's the same thing over and over and over again until our minds are numbed and we are dumber because of it. There's a lot of other things I detest about this movie, but I fear that exposing more of my dislikes will add insult to injury. In short, the other defects in the movie include inconsistent characters (especially Trinity), useless characters (Agent Smith), a terrible ending, a convoluted and ultimately absurd plot, and some really terrible editing, especially towards the last 15 minutes or so.All in all The Matrix Reloaded is a severely hyped up letdown much like previous May releases like Attack of the Clones, Pearl Harbor, Godzilla, and a hoard of others. Reloaded is as bad as if not worse than most of these. It's a nasty thing to say, probably the biggest insult a movie can be handed, but this is a grand sci-fi world gone completely to waste. Why? First, because of a budget that's more than twice that of the original which relied on it's story to bring about it's incredible action. Second, it seems like the script was whipped up in a few days after the first one became a big hit. Argue what you want, the original was a movie within itself that concluded just fine. Reloaded makes the mistake of using its story so that the Wachowski's can direct some big action sequences. Be very cautious of your expectations on July 2nd when T3 comes out.",1,0,0,16 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," As Ron Weasly would say, this movie is 'bloody brilliant'
","As Ron Weasley would say, this movie is 'bloody brilliant.' Of course, this time around he would say it in a much deeper voice. Indeed the children from the first film have matured beyond what anyone could have expected. Even though filming reportedly began shortly after The Sorcerer's Stone opened a year ago, every single child character seems to have gone through the biggest parts of puberty in just a year. Ron's (Rupert Grint) voice is cracklier, Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) is deeper, Malfoy (Tom Felton) seems to have grown feet, not inches, and Granger (Emma Watson) has transformed into an even more mature version of herself.The magic of our introduction to these characters and to the world of Wizardry is gone and this film is much darker than the first; barely any daylight penetrates the school. Most children will find a few of the scenes much too frightening where as Sorcerer's Stone was a film that everyone could find delightful. The spider sequence in the Forbidden Forest scared me more than anything else since Arachnophobia. Surprise surprise, I'm arachnophobic (mostly due to the aforementioned movie), but the fact remains that this sequence, and many similar ones in the movie, were treated as they would be in any great mainstream thriller. Even though I'm still emotionally shaken from that scene, I respect that Columbus does not sacrifice anything just to make it more acceptable.I am able to respect this mostly because this movie is an even greater visual treat than the first (as if that were possible). Even though I used to be a huge special effects advocate, after the recent Star Wars disasters and a hoard of other films that have misused special effects, I have gone over to the other side. Then comes along the first two installments of this series, which make better use of special effects than any other movies I have ever seen. In Chamber, there is a Quiddich match between Gryffindor and Slytherin that is even more heart pounding than the one in Sorcerer's Stone (again, as if that were possible). The seeker's, Potter and Malfoy, chase thorough the bowels of the stadium after the Golden Snitch with a rogue bludger trying to take Harry out for good. If the Quiddich matches keep getting better and better, I can't wait to see what they will do for the fourth installment, Goblet of Fire, where our heroes go to the Quiddich World Cup. Even before the Quiddich match we are treated to a Whomping Willow which is grander, more violent, and more visually pleasing than I was prepared for. And then there's good ol' Dobby - the most successful fully animated character in a live action film. While Jar Jar Binks was a technical marvel, I don't know a person on this planet what wouldn't pay to see him killed. Dobby could have been another Jar Jar, but his screen time is kept in check and his humor is just right. There's also a flying car, a huge snake (which may be as frightening to children as the spiders), a duel between Malfoy and Potter, a great hall that is even more gorgeous than before, and a flurry of small but pleasing wizardry special effects.My biggest reason for liking this movie is that it is the best fusion between an older style of filmmaking and a newer one. It makes use of the grand technology that we have today, but never lets it dominate the incredibly engaging characters, especially the supporting cast, nor does it hinder the progression of the plot one bit. Richard Harris will be sorely missed as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. He brought such great charisma to the film and his role gets more and more vital as the series continues. I hope that Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, and Felton all decide to stay on for the entire series. Each of them is such a perfect fit for their role that it is hard to imagine anyone else playing Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco. Then there's Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and all the other professors at the school - each of which is so different from the other that it is hard to give each of them enough screen time without making the movie even longer.It is inevitable that every fantasy movie will have a few things that I wish would have been done different. I wanted to spend a little more time with the Weasley family because each one of them is such a delight and their house is a small magical wonderland. But, I understand that it was important for this film to get onto center stage as quickly as possible, and center stage for this film meant Hogwarts. Even though my memory is a little hazy, there were some interesting classroom scenes that were left out (again, understandable because none of them are truly necessary). My biggest regret is that Ron and Hermione, who are constantly at each other's throats in the novel, don't have that same relationship in the movie. There is part in the end where they refrain from hugging to shake hands. My editor, who has not read the novels, was understandably confused as to why they didn't hug.As I said earlier, Chamber of Secrets is the worst novel in the series. Actually, it's the only one I haven't read twice. Luckily, the plot structure, twists and turns are what Rowling has never failed at. I enjoyed the ways the mystery was revealed piece by piece even though I had previous knowledge of everything. The third act of the movie consists of a long stretch of action (intertwined with all the revelations to bring the story full circle). This is where most movies would screw everything up and settle into a final battle that is pedestrian if even that. Chamber of Secrets builds up to this the entire time so a final battle sequence with Harry, a large snake, and a phoenix is more than welcome. We've waited for it for over two hours, we need the payoff. The hardest part of a movie might be the post climax wrap up. I remember how much I enjoyed Dumbledore's final chat with Harry in the first installment, and the same thing happens here. Additionally, there is a little 'standoff' between slave Dobby and master Lucius Malfoy that gave everyone a good laugh.Here are a few quick things I could spend hours more writing about: the humor in this film keeps it alive and energetic in an otherwise dark and frightening setting. Stuart Craig (the production designer) has returned to create an incredible marvelous magical world by expanding the grandeur of Hogwarts. We get to venture into parts of the school that we had no idea existed before with little nooks, crannies, pipes, bathrooms, classrooms, and so much more. Kenneth Branagh (who plays Gilderoy Lockhart) is a wonderful addition to the established cast of teachers and clearly enjoys himself in this role. John Williams again provides a musical score which is so far the best this year. Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) makes himself contemptible and dark from the very beginning and keeps the evil vibe in every scene he is in. The pacing is incredible, it jumps right into the plotline and into the world of wizardry because all the basic rules have already been established.I don't know how this second installment will be received, but it is a rare feat in modern cinema: a second installment that is as good as, if not better than, the first. With Columbus no longer opting to direct the third installment (due out in 2004), I hope that the next two movies don't falter because this could easily be the greatest series in film history. Harry Potter has made more than a believer out of me with a world as grand and imaginative as Lucas's original Star Wars trilogy, but with sufficiently more in terms of characters and witty dialogue. And to think, a year ago I would have liked nothing more than to see the Sorcerer's Stone fail. And then I saw the movie. Oh what a difference a year makes.",7,0,0,4 December 2002
War of the Worlds," Truly frightening and gripping.
","Grade: A-War of the Worlds is an incredible movie that shows why Spielberg is the best director alive today. The overall plot is relatively simple: aliens invade earth, family tries to survive. But, it's the way that Spielberg handles everything that makes this movie what it is.WOTW wastes no time getting started. We see the tripods (the aliens vehicles) within the first 10 minutes, and we know their intent almost immediately. The first action sequence is gripping, among the best I've ever seen. The tripod death rays come within inches of Ray, vaporizing everyone around him as he sprints though human ash. This scene sets the tone for the movie which is darker and more frightening than anything we expect from Spielberg (except Schindler's List).The visual effects, especially the gargantuan tripods, take the frightening feel of the movie to another level. But, the most spectacular visual sequence of the film does not have any visual effects in it at all. It's something I've come to expect of Spielberg now. The most spectacular shot in Minority Report, a movie filled with dazzling CG, is where John and Agatha are holding each other, their faces in opposite directions, while the propose opposing ideas. Similarly, in War of the Worlds, there is a sequence where Ray and his kids are speeding down the freeway, and the camera seamlessly moves around the vehicle without being dizzying (Ala LOTR).The decision to make this movie from the point of view of Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his two kids, as opposed to Independence Day which chose multiple points of view, is the right decision. We get personal with Ray, Rachel (Dakota Fanning), and Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and so we care what happens to them in every second of every scene. Ray's fight to save his children is even more gripping and Rachel's terrified screams even more piercing. Additionally, the movie transitions between the loud and the quiet scenes extremely well. The moments Ray has with Rachel and Robbie are just as important and entertaining as when the Tripods wreak havoc.A lot of people have a problem with the ending, saying that it came to suddenly. It did not come out of the blue for me, but then again I've read the book. However, my friends who had not read the book felt the same way I did. The only real problem I had with the ending is that even though it fit with the plot, it didn't tie in with the theme very well. All in all, forgivable for what is otherwise such an entertaining film.I think many people had trouble in the quieter scenes because they had issues with Mr. Scientology and his ridiculous publicity stunt romance with Katie Holmes. Once the lights went down, I was able to forget about Tom Cruise and instead watch Ray Ferrier for the entire running length. Cruise has always been one of my favorite actors and he gives another great performance here. Nothing award deserving, but effective nonetheless. He can be as crazy as he wants off the screen as long as his work on the screen continues to be this good.There is also the 'it kid' of the moment, Dakota Fanning. If you've ever wondered why there's so much talk about how talented this 11 year old girl is, watch this movie. Dakota is able to truly become a character better than most actors, regardless of age. If you don't believe me, then watch War of the Worlds and then watch Man on Fire. If you still, don't believe me, maybe you'll believe Denzel Washington, who said, 'Twice in my career I can remember doing a scene and finding myself just watching that other actor. Once was with Gene Hackman, and once with Dakota.' Now that's a hell of a compliment.War of the Worlds is the second best movie of the year after Batman Begins. It doesn't strive for the level of perfection that Batman does, but it is incredible in it's own right as a film that's much more than just great popcorn entertainment.",7,0,2,21 July 2005
Prometheus," The most amazing sci-fi film in a very long time
","Prometheus is a brilliant visual sci-fi marvel. Ridley Scott has given us an epic film that survives independent of the Alien movies even if it is somewhat of a prequel to the series. The look of the film is arresting from the onset. The opening sequence, presumably on Earth, sweeps through a massive lake and waterfall, up the cliff face and to a single living being. The being is human-like, but not quite human. He drinks something that causes him to decompose rapidly. Eventually, his DNA ends up in the water where it seems to recombine and, again, presumably, become human DNA.Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/prometheus/ to read the complete review!",9,4,8,10 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Monumental film capping off the best film trilogy ever made
","The Dark Knight Rises is a monumental film capping off the best film trilogy ever made. More Batman Begins than The Dark Knight, the film isn't at a constant climax. Nolan invokes some short flashbacks from the first film, but aside from mentions of Harvey Dent there's very little from TDK. There is a deliberate pacing that takes us from a peaceful, boring Gotham with a retired Batman to the greatest city in the world on the brink of annihilation.Unlike the first film in the trilogy, TDKR isn't quite as centered around Bruce Wayne or Batman. The screen is shared by a flurry of characters. Bane, Catwoman, Miranda Tate, Luscious Fox, Detective Blake, and the always welcome Alfred all get a considerable portion of screen time. Lesser important characters who should have been scrapped also push the running length to 164 minutes, though it never feels like it. The film centers around the masked terrorist Bane's plans to bring Gotham to its knees much like Ra's Al Ghul's plans in the first film. Bane's antics force both Bruce Wayne and Batman out of retirement to try to save his beloved city.Let's just get this out of the way: there's no Joker or equivalent thereof here. There's no performance like Heath Ledger's, but TDKR is a much better film than TDK. It doesn't connect the complex plot points as masterfully as its predecessor. What it does masterfully is inject some much needed emotion into the fight for Gotham. We gladly trade our jaws dropping in a 'cool! how'd they do that?' moment for our eyes watering wondering 'does Batman love his city so much he'll actually die for it?'.Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are phenomenal. Between the Bat, essentially the new flying Batmobile, and a Bat Pod that shows off even more features, there's no shortage of cool technology. Bruce Wayne even has a little remote to make sure the paparazzi don't get in his way.Even with the new gadgets, the fist fights are greatly improved from the first two films. Bane is physically superior to Batman and on par mentally. Tom Hardy has bulked up for this role. There's no six pack on Bane, he's got some flab, but it just adds to his mass. This guy is huge and terrifying. Throw in Hardy's incredibly expressive eyes and you've got a true force of evil. Hardy also seems to have a unique ability to act during his fight sequences. We can see the speed of his punches and feel his punches when he pummels Batman.While he's the least interesting of the three major villains, TDKR spices things up with some much needed estrogen with Catwoman and Miranda Tate. Anne Hathaway is exceptional, gracefully pouncing around Gotham and dealing some punishment in some very tall heels. Catwoman has always been a good guy/bad guy who lives by her own moral code, and Nolan's version stays true to the heart of the character in the comics. Miranda is a beautiful, strong millionaire who is drawn to Bruce through his philanthropy. She comes to his aid and rescues Wayne Enterprises after one of Bane's terrorist acts at the stock exchange.I've heard some complaints about how Bane's antics are too reminiscent of the times, playing much to the Occupy crowd. I think that's ludicrous and anyone that has seen the other two films will certainly agree. Bane's antics at the stock exchange hearken back to Batman Begins where The League of Shadows admitted to using economics to send Gotham spiraling out of control. Beyond that event the death toll in Gotham is catastrophic. Bane blows the city half to hell and releases prison inmates immediately after breaking the morale of Harvey Dent's supporters. It's anarchy as the rich are ripped from their homes, the police are trapped, and no one is safe anywhere.The second half of the film comes to an unforgettable climax that is the most enthralling cinema in a long time. The significant amount of IMAX footage makes the action scenes as epic as can be and Nolan's refusal to use 3D means we get to see it in a proper high resolution format whether you're in an IMAX setting or not. TDKR isn't without it's faults. The music blares inappropriately quite often. There's some pretty poor exposition in the script at times (a little puzzling why backstory wasn't worked in better in this long a movie with such exceptional writers). And, the plot twists are quite predictable for those loyal to the comics. Even despite all that, TDKR is the movie everyone wanted and then some. It doesn't have the innocence and humor that made Batman Begins the best of the trilogy, but it does up the ante in terms of scale and emotion. It is easily the best movie this year so far and perhaps the best conclusion a trilogy has ever had.For more reviews like this one as well as other movie musings, go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/",9,1,5,21 July 2012
X2: X-Men United," Flat out incredible
","Grade: AThere's so much to talk about in a two-and-a-half hour movie that it's absolutely overwhelming. The movie starts with a highly original special effects sequence; something of a rarity in today's copycat special effects market. This sequence involves Nightcrawler's assassination attempt on the President where he takes out all of the Secret Service Agents in the White House. This 'poof' special effect used for Nightcrawler's teleportation is one of the many wow-factors in this movie. Unlike most films, the opening sequence here is a good indicator of things to come. On a side note, director Bryan Singer makes an excellent decision to not mimic any special effects from The Matrix. X2 succeeds in the one department it's predecessor fell short in: special effects. Not only does it succeed, it's one of the few movies each year that effectively utilizes special effects (Minority Report and Harry Potter 2 were the only two from last year's effects filled pics).Beyond the first sequence the movie flows effortlessly through it's plot points. The only complaint I really have is that the editing was not as good as it could have been. The scene-by-scene editing was fine, in fact I would have more than gladly stayed in the theatre to watch a 5-hour version of X2, but the in-scene editing could have used a little work at times. The storytelling is all but forgotten with a director like Singer aboard and with screenwriters that seem to know all the beloved characters inside and out. Fans of the series are given tastes of characters like Colossus, Jubilee (for about a second), Shadowcat, and most exciting is the preview of Jean's Phoenix character which I will mention later. This movie uses a perfect balance of characters from the first film while adding just enough to keep it interesting and not convolute it. I'd love to see Apocalypse, more Sabretooth, Morph, Beast, Gambit, and a whole lot of other characters in the next few films, but I can wait for them as long as the movies are of this high quality.I didn't expect much from this film because of all the problems that were rumored during production (the most prominent was about some or all of the actors storming off a set when they, the director, and the producers all had some disagreement). But, most of the cast is absolutely flawless. Halle Berry and James Marsden (Cyclops) are the only weak links in the chain. Cyclops' crying scene towards the end drew quite a few chuckles from the crowd and besides her Oscar winning turn in Monster's Ball (which she did deserve), Berry has been one of the worst actresses in Hollywood. This time around her character has about the same number of lines, but none of the lines are as ridiculous as her 'do you know what happens to a Toad...' line from the first movie. Besides, Storm kicks some major ass in this movie, especially in the tornado sequence where the Blackbird escapes two ensuing F-16's in breathtaking fashion.What I liked most about his film was that even though it was PG-13, the characters even more closely resembled their comic book origins. Wolverine finally got to go absolutely berserk and actually stab people. When the mansion is invaded by government agents, Wolverine is shown stabbing a whole lot of them. Needless to say, this was one of the best moments in the film for me. Wolverine's character in the first installment was done as well as possible for the first film in a series, but in this movie his character will please the fans a lot more. The use of mutants' powers was so creative that I smiled even when I knew what was coming. Even when I knew who the shape shifter Mystique morphed into, I was able to appreciate the way Singer and his crew were able to use the camera in such a way as not to disappoint. My favorite use of mutant power has to go unmentioned because it is somewhat of a surprise, but in short: Magneto detects the iron in someone's body and extracts that iron to form balls which he uses to propel as bullets. I hope you can ignore the run on sentences, because after a midnight showing of such an incredible film, I'm definitely on a energy high.Now, I haven't even mentioned the names Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, or Patrick Stewart yet. Then again there's also Brian Cox, Famke Janssen, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Anna Paquin, and Alan Cumming. In a summary of cast praise, the newcomers are all great with Cumming being the standout, and you get what you expect out of the cast from the first movie. I've said this before and I'll say it again: no actor has ever nailed a comic book character as well as Hugh Jackman has nailed Wolverine. Jackman is probably the most fortunate last minute casting change in movie history.The character development is as good as it can be in a movie with so many people. I'm really unqualified to comment on how well the movie developed the characters because I new everything about them coming in to the film. Still, my friends who were not X-Men comic veterans didn't seem to have a problem grasping anything at all (another plus on Singer's resume). That being said, they also weren't fully able to appreciate the meaning behind the glimpses of Jean's full power. Everything from her nightmares in the beginning to her decision in the end is indicative of things to come in the next movie. Now, I can't comment for sure, but my bet is that the next movie will be about The Phoenix Saga. The last scene in the movie scans over the water where the damn burst with a running narration from Jean. Under the water we see a glowing firey object flying though the water just before the closing credits roll. What an absolutely incredible tease of an ending. The movie concludes in itself, but like all other great sci-fi/fantasy movies, it gives a glimpse of things to come.All in all I can't say enough about X-Men 2. The action and story are incredible; when they are interlaced with a highly capable cast and jaw-dropping effects, it all makes for one of the best summer movies I have ever seen. This movie is exactly what the box office needs right now: a good movie that will have people rushing out to the multiplexes in the weeks to come.  By the end of this movie if you don't find yourself debating which mutant's powers you most desire, I think it's safe to say your imagination is completely dead. I hope I don't have to wait another three years for X3 (a.k.a. The Phoenix Saga?). So, which mutant do you want to be?",9,0,0,16 May 2003

Fantastic Four," Exactly what it pretends to be: pretty good popcorn entertainment.
","Grade: C+Fantastic Four is nothing more than it pretends to be: a big, loud, popcorn movie with cool special effects and an incredibly hot Jessica Alba showing off some cleavage. Just a note for my fellow males, you do get to see Ms. Alba in her undergarments, but only for a few seconds. The highest grade a movie with such low aspirations can possible achieve is a B. So, I found Fantastic Four to be entertaining, but not that entertaining. It could have, and should have, been better. It tries to follow the recent successful trend in exploring the origins of a superhero (or heroes in this case), but the problem is that is just keeps exploring for no apparent reason.I've never been a fan of the Fantastic Four comic books because they were very light and fluffy. As far as the movie, it's not quite as lowly as Hulk (another comic book that I wasn't particularly fond of), but no where near the same league as the X-Men films either. The special effects are just okay. The Human Torch looks pretty good, but Mr. Fantastic looked very fake any time he stretched a limb. Visually the movie is very pedestrian. No cool camera angles, action sequences, or visual themes. The script is no work of art, but the poor direction brings the film down even further.Like I said before, the biggest problem about FF is that it's not really about anything. There's no plot, nothing to keep looking forward to. The entire movie is about the four getting their powers and trying to get rid of them. That should have taken about half-an-hour tops before really diving into some kind of forward moving plot. Only one of the four, Johnny Storm a.k.a. The Human Torch, actually embraces their powers. If you had any of the four's powers, don't you think it would be fun to experiment a little instead of staying cooped up in an apartment all day? The casting was also questionable. Jessica Alba is hot, but I sure don't buy her as an uber-genius scientist. I did not buy her as a blond or a big sister either. She worked as The Invisible Woman, but her acting skills are definitely limited. I also was a little annoyed by Ioan Gruffudd (Reed Richards a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic) even when he was not supposed to be annoying. The other two of the four were casted well. Michael Chiklis was great as Ben Grimm a.k.a. The Thing. His character is the only one with a story worth exploring. He is also the only one we ever feel sorry for because his appearance has permanently changed into a man shaped rock. I think The Thing should have been a lot bigger and more intimidating, but that's something the director probably screwed up. Chris Evans, Johnny Storm, gave the movie some much needed comic relief. The way he took life so casually, trying to hook-up with every hot girl he saw, was a perfect counterbalance to the seriousness projected by all the scientists.All in all I had fun watching the Fantastic Four. Would I watch it again? Probably not. It's very blah. But, its not so bad watching it once in an air conditioned theater for a couple of hours on a hot summer day.",5,0,1,21 July 2005
