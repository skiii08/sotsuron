Raiders of the Lost Ark," May never be topped
","There may never be another movie as good as this one.  People are crying for Indy 4, but I don't really understand why, we all know that no matter who is attached to the project they'll never top this movie.  20 year old, with countless action/adventure movies made since, it is still the greatest of all time.  A few thoughts on the beloved Raiders:-Great, dark villans.  Great rivalry between Belloq and Indy.-Allen and Ford are great together, and the score is wonderful.-Wisely holds back on the supernatural until the very end.-Indy seems like a semi-real person.  He's not a kung-fu master or anything stupid like that.  He gets hurt and shows fear, although he sure gets punched in the head a lot without getting knocked out.-Great locations, Cairo is really mysterious place and is a perfect setting for this sort of thing.-Stunts and battles are great, without any CGI assistance.-Comedy is present, but it's not 'in your face'.  Funny things happen, but they aren't 'jokes' like one liners.  Plus all of the comedic events still stick to reality.  Toht gets two great laughs and he is by far the darkest character in the film.So how can a movie have comedy, romance, horror, adventure, action and suspense, and not be stupid in some way?  Well, it CAN'T- this movie is a miracle, it shouldn't have turned out this well.  The sequels, although entertaining and better than most sequels are, don't even approach this movie.  Basically, the odds of anything even close to this coming out in our lifetimes is one in a million.",10,0,0,19 January 2001
The Terminator," The holy grail of Sci-fi horror.
","IMHO, you can't do much better than the Terminator.  It is sci-fi horror at its finest.  This movie introduces us to one of the best villains ever seen next to Darth Vader himself.  Anyone who prefers the kinder, gentler Terminator over the monster that Arnold portrays here is a person with quite different tastes than mine.  Watching that cyborg calmly slicing his damaged eye out and impersonating Sara's Mom are chilling sights that you won't soon forget!  Arnold absolutely makes this movie what it is, it's true that he was born to play this role, although all others involved are excellent. Most people of course think of the 'I'll be back' line, which has become Arnold's catch phrase, and has become rather tired.  Not here.  The things that the Terminator says ARE often funny, but not in a yuck-yuck one liner type of way.  The key is that the Terminator is not trying to be funny at all!  He SEEMS funny because he simply makes demands or states facts, which is not the way real humans interact.  So we laugh when the Terminator says, 'I'll be back', not in a 'Arnolds bein' funny' way, but in a nervous, 'what's the heck is he talking about?' way.  He truly appears to have no soul at all, and gives the performance of a lifetime. So for those who like Arnold's newer, funnier movies, be warned- don't expect anything pleasant here. There is no kid, no happy ending, no 'everything will be all right' message. The Terminator is very bleak, very scary, very dark, and not for everyone by any means.  But if you like sci-fi horror movies this is the holy grail and may never be topped.P.S. -I don't know much about guns, but listen carefully to what the Terminator tries to order in the gun shop early in the film.  Also notice that he stares downward while talking in this scene because he's reading the list off his eyeballs.  Great attention to detail, great stuff!!",10,1,1,5 December 2001
Jaws," Most terrifying movie of all time. Here's why:
","As of this writing there are 160 comments for this movie and it ranks an 8.2.  I ask, where does it lose that 1.8 points?  It's perfect, my favorite movie of all time.  If I had to guess why some wouldn't like it, I suppose it could be because Bruce doesn't match the live shark footage in the film. Or maybe people prefer a CGI shark?  I'm stumped.  See Deep Blue Sea if you want that, and you'll see that CGI sharks don't make a movie.  Besides, Bruce looks great in 90% of the shots, especially when he rises up under Brody during the last stand.  I've often wondered- why is it that as the years go by and technology advances, the sharks in the Jaws movies just look worse and worse?Everybody has seen this, so to summarize the plot is a waste of time.  No other movie has terrified the world in such a way.  The most terrifying films of all time don't get into your head like this.  There are few people who are afraid of hotels due to the Shining, and even fewer fear demonic possession (Exorcist), or Zombies (NOTLD).  Now these are among the scariest films ever made and I love them dearly, but they don't get to you like Jaws. I've heard that in the past some people feared the shower after seeing Psycho, but come on, Jaws kept MILLIONS away from the beaches, and people still fear the ocean to this day.  That is true, irrational FEAR, spanning 25 years, especially since it is rather common knowledge that sharks are about as interested in eating people as they are logs.  This movie had the same effect on cinema as War of the Worlds did on radio.  It showed that the entire nation can be profoundly affected by what is on that screen.So see this masterpiece again, and for heaven's sake, DON'T watch it on TV. The edited pan and scan version just doesn't cut it, and you don't even get to see what happens to Quint. As for my feelings about the DVD, I really enjoyed some of the new sounds, but overall the original is still the best.  It doesn't matter though, only people who've seen this film hundreds of times like me will notice the new sounds anyway.",10,2,4,13 October 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," No Oscar for this!
","Nothing will ever be made in our lifetimes like this trilogy, and ROTK is the best of the three.  I just hope it doesn't win an Oscar, this movie can't be compared to anything else ever made in mankind's history and an Oscar would tarnish it and bring it down to the level of dreck that typically wins.  Besides, the first two didn't win best picture which destroyed any shred of credibility the Academy ever had.  What beat the first 2 films?  A musical and a me-so-crazy flick, proof that this Oscar 'award' is a wart, not an honor.  I cry for NO OSCAR, it would be a blemish on the cover of the DVD.  This movie will be around LONG after the past winners are forgotten forever, you can count on that! I suppose there is really no need to continue watching movies after seeing this, once perfection is achieved it is time to move on to another medium. Perhaps I'll learn to play an instrument or take up painting. See ROTK but DON'T watch the Oscars, the people 'honoring' it are not worthy enough to rub Peter Jackson's feet!",10,0,0,18 December 2003
Evil Dead II," Who's laughing now? I am!
","Man, I love ED2.  If you've heard of this and are researching it on IMDB, then odds are you've already seen it, so there's no need to explain what it is about.  It follows the first rule of a horror/comedy which is don't make the monsters funny, make the characters funny.  When the monsters become funny, the horror is lost, and a stupid movie is born.  Funny things can happen TO the monsters, but they themselves cannot be the source of the laughs, and that's the case with ED2!  The deadites are truly menacing and there are some great scares, but Ash the hero is the one who draws the laughs.  Scared out of his mind and a bit on the slow side, Bruce Campbell acts the way a normal person probably would under these circumstances, namely he screams in terror and fights for his very life.  The best horror/comedy ever made.",10,3,3,13 December 2000
