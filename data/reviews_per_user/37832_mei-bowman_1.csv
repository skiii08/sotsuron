Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Did not think I would like it, but...
","I had seen/heard various clips since the summer and honestly did not care to see it. On Late Night with Conan, he talked about one particular scene involving nudity that did not sound appealing at all. But one very late night at a hotel I decided to give it a chance.It truly is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.The scene Conan talked about had me laughing so hard I rolled off the bed in tears. I was sure someone was going to call the front desk for my disturbing their sleep at 1:30am.Anyway, I thoroughly recommend this movie for a huge laugh. If you haven't considered it before, don't knock it til you've tried watching it at least once...Sacha Cohen is brilliant; it's a shame he was not nominated for an Oscar!",9,1,5,29 January 2007
