Men in Black 3," A summer flick that's out of this world.
","Aliens. Laser blasters. A weird buddy comedy reminiscent of 'Lethal Weapon' dressed up in black suits and sunglasses. After ten years of absence, it's the mother-effin' Men in Black, and if you were a fan of the first two films, 'Men in Black 3' will tickle your fancy so hard you'll damn near pee yourself with delight. This is good, silly, alien- vaporizing fun, and it's very apparent that Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and the entire supporting cast are having an absolute blast as they romp around time like a rugby team at an open bar.For the rest of my review, please check out my movie review blog: http://filmsallthetime.blogspot.com",8,1,3,6 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not quite amazing, but very damn good.
","The biggest glaring issue 'The Amazing Spider-Man' falls to is the inconsistency of its special effects: despite getting glammed-up by the Hollywood treatment, the film's CGI waxes and wanes from sleek and stylish action sequences to Windows 98-generated goofiness. It's a small crack in this movie's rather impressive visual exoskeleton, but one that is majorly detrimental to some of the fight scenes and larger set pieces. Still, it doesn't take away too much from what this film is all about: incredibly digestible entertainment value. This is the Spider-Man adventure Stan Lee certainly wants us to see, and the one we as audiences have been waiting for. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' serves up exactly what every summer moviegoer seeks: a film that combines the best parts of the franchise's campy melodrama, honest ideals, and web- slinging fun. And when all is said and done, the effort proves to be not just satisfying, but absolutely heroic.",8,1,2,6 July 2012
