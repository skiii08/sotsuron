Hereditary," Masterpiece brutality
","Damn, it was so good and brutal so I can't sleep this damn dark night. Hail Paimon. Damn, the scariest movie of the year.",9,0,2,27 July 2019
Captain Marvel," It's not epic but I haven't another great movie for you
","Refreshingly entertainly. One of the best comic space opera I've ever seen. If you wanna get 2 funny hours under your table you don't regret. Extremely highly recommended if you boring to watch so tedious mainstream 'heroes movie'. Yes, it dulls played. Yes, this movie has a bad and stupid script. Technically it just a cheap comedy with 100m dollars special effects but it surprisingly warm and funny.",6,0,0,30 June 2019
Hotel Mumbai," Save your time and money: Don't watch this garbage
",It's one of the most worth stupid movies with an absolutely awful script and tons of violence. They kill them all. All. Do not thank me. Save your time for something seriously important.,1,241,520,23 June 2019
Joker," Overrated mediocre movie
","I just watched it. And I want to say: 'So What?'. Worthless, rude and senseless. What the main idea? Is it will fill the gap between countless 'batman's universe movies'? Okay. I'm happy about that. If you decide to watch 'story about sick man' just find 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' by Milos Forman. Overrated 'blockbuster'. With a 'zillion dollars budget' spent on advertising.",5,4,8,12 November 2019
