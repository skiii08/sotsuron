Black Swan," This movie had a lot of buzz for a reason
","I didn't even feel like watching a movie before i started, my mom wanted to show me the movie. I became engaged quickly and the climax of this movie hit me in the chest and i found myself empathizing and feeling drunk with power and adrenaline like the main character seemed to be. I even have tattoos from this movie as a version of yin and yang. I'm a perfectionist, an artist, stuck in youth but also longing my full confident potential. I have trouble expressing myself especially since I'm into other women. For lack of better word I related with Nina and it was so powerful. A mix of elegance and horror. I think those that dislike this movie simply don't understand it, or may be looking for reasons to hate it since everyone loves it. Its possible they are the same people that dislike things like art and poetry and drama in general, assuming the creator is trying too hard. I think they are simply uncomfortable with the level of depth and wouldn't feel comfortable expressing themselves in these ways",10,0,0,28 March 2020
