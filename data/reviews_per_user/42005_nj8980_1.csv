Ford v Ferrari," A must watch again, one of my top 5 favs
","This academy award star studded fact based is a must watch. Even if you are not motor racing fan, you will like the brilliant performance of Christian Bale (Playing Ken Miles a racing car engineer), Matt_Damon (Playing Carroll Shelby American automotive designer, racing driver, entrepreneur) even less familiar Jon Bernthal (Playing Lee Iacocca- man behind Mustang) will never fail to engage you. In terms of racing movies this looks more real, thrilling with great sound, excellent cinematography and meticulous directions. It's several notches ahead than fast and furious. It is now one of my favorite 5 movies.For me It's a must watch again.",8,2,5,18 November 2019
