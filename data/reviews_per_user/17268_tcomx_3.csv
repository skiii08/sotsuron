Skyfall," Disappointment
","After the first 2 DC outings as Bond, I was looking forward to this one. However as the the film progressed, I started to get a sinking feeling. This was 100% confirmed during the scenes leading up to and including M's demise.The action sequences, great. The casting, great. The theme song, great. The story / script, did someone forget it.Like most people, I've seen all the films, most at the cinema. Like most, we all forgive the implausibility of some scenes (action), because overall everything else makes up for them. Like most, we leave the cinema with a feeling that we have enjoyed what we spent our dosh on. But this time I left feeling let down, something was not right, something was missing, and in this case it was a story. Even Moonraker had that.",5,7,11,30 December 2014
It's a Wonderful Life," A different view
","Firstly before everyone has a go, I am not in any way knocking the film or the quality of it. In fact its a shame films today are not made with the same love, care and attention to detail. I also agree that it is one of the greatest films ever made, its just I see the film a little different when taken as a whole.Where most people see this film as a happy one for all the obvious reasons, including that ending, I see it as one of the most depressing and sad stories ever made. Ask yourself the question, why did he want to commit suicide in the first place. The reason is that throughout the first half of the film/story, all you see is everyone doing what they want, including his brother. Whereas he is forced via circumstance or emotional blackmail to stay and cater to the wants of everyone else. Where were the 'friends and family' when things got bad, why didn't anyone see what was going on. The main reason was cause they were more concerned with themselves. The outcome of all this is the famous bridge seen. And in my eyes, even Clarence ended up using him to get his wings.By showing him what life for all those he has helped, would be like if he hadn't existed, is if anything, another case of emotional blackmail. He is again made to feel bad and ungrateful for his lot.My point is, why didn't anyone ask him what he wanted and then help him go for it etc.My final comment is, when you next watch this film, or read this comment, take a look around you and see if anyone you know and care about is quietly sinking and give them a helping hand before it gets too bad. The chances are if they are your friend or part of your family, they have already helped you and now they quietly need your help.",9,0,2,17 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disappointing
","There's not much that I can add to all the other reviews. Just like Skyfall, I went yesterday to see this and came out very disappointed. My 11 year old daughter, who loved Episode 3 and 5 said this was boring.There was nothing, new or exciting about it and as it was just a poor rehash of episode 4, it was also very predictable. Say what you may about George Lucas as a director etc, but at least he knew how to tell a story. It is doubtful if I will bother with the next 2, and instead will just enjoy watching the story George Lucas gave us.",3,60,74,6 March 2016
