The Incredible Hulk," Fun for Rental with a group of friends...but thats all you'll get
","When I first saw that this movie was coming out to theaters...I was a little disappointed. My first reaction was 'oh great. another unneeded remake. most likely just to make a quick buck'. I will also add that I was surprised and relieved after i viewed this film because it was not at all what I had expected at first. and come on Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt all together...that's the sign of great potential to be a good film. Overall, it was a 'decent' (don't take that word for any more than I'm trying to use it as) film that at least kept me awake and maybe a little interested. it definitely had its downfalls (for example: who goes to watch a movie called 'The Incredible Hulk' to watch a bunch of people discuss what they should do?....no! they come to watch Hulk Smash!!!! So, my suggestion is that they should have shown more Hulk than just the characters running from each other). Anyways, I will compare this film to the original because I didn't mind the original...even though it seems everyone else did. I thought it wasn't as bad as everyone said, but that's not the important issue. I believe this movie and the original are about the same, so if you hated the original I wouldn't give this a try, but if you loved the original then don't expect any differences but do expect coming out with a good feeling. So, even though I didn't come out that disappointed there were still some pretty major flaws that brought it down on its knees. It's just the same old superhero concept; The main character has superhuman abilities, has to learn to control them and use them for good, the conflict arises as another equally powerful villain, and thus ending in a great battle between good vs. evil and, of course, good comes out victorious. 6/10 for enjoyment reasons only....oh and P.S. ***spoilers (not bad ones though) spoilers*** Robert Downey Jr. makes a surprise appearance at the end as Mr. Tony Stark (Iron Man) in which he discusses with one of the main characters that he and his group are thinking about making a team...most likely hinting that there will be a movie with all the superheroes and villains to make one colossal movie (something along the lines of The Avengers)...that got me excited.",6,1,4,26 October 2008
