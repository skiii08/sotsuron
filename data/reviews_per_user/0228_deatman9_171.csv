Changeling," Another Eastwood masterpiece!
",Is it eveb possible for Clint Eastwood to make anything but an outstanding movie? I think he is easily one of the best directors of this Era. This movie is filled with great acting and a powerful emotional sotry line.This movie is based on the true story of the chicken coops murders. Jolies character has her son abducted and taken away. She goes to the police for help but when they say they found her son she seens that it isn't her son. They try to convince everyone it is her son and when she says it isn't the cops retaliate agaisnt her.This is a very amazing movie. It has a great story line great actors. Usually Angelina Jolie is nothing special but she did great here. This is a roller coaster ride of emotions a very very good movie watch it now,Null,2,3,4 August 2011
Men in Black 3," Not bad but still not as good as the first one.
",For the most part this movie was entertaining enough. Much better then the second one was however not nearly as good as the first. The addition of Josh Brolin was a nice change he played his part perfectly however he plays a 29 year old so he was a bit old. Will Smith is back and he is talented and funny as usual as well as your typical Men in black story line. Evil alien trying to take over the world. Its up to the boys at the Men in Black to stop it.The reason this movie was not as good as the first is mainly because it felt sort of cheesy. I mean this movie was made 14 years after the first one and I swear the CGI in this one is somehow worse. Despite it having an 130 million dollar budget for some reason they can only make CGI that looks cartoonish and childish as if its trying to appeal to young children which I don't think it is because it is rated pg-13 and there is some parts in it and I quote 'You are a piece of sh!t' said directly at someones face. So- I think they cheaped out majorly on the effects and the story line was very typical and predictable.Overall Fans of the original probably wont enjoy this one too much. I think it would be perfect for perhaps a ten year old and his friend to watch. Im thinking they would have a blast with it but for me I rate it simply average.,5,1,2,18 April 2013
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I really liked it
",This movie gets a lot of hate and I don't understand why. It is a very funny movie from start to finish. Yes it is offensive so if your stuck up and have no sense of humor you probably wont like it.This movie is about Cohen playing a character named borat. He is from Kazekstan and he goes to America to make educational video for the people of his country. The interesting thing about this movie is only Borat is a made up character all the only people in the conversations are not actors.This movie has many hilarious moments if you don't mind a bit of offensive material. I love how they don't use actors and instead film actual people. I don't understand how Cohen keeps a straight face?,8,0,0,31 May 2012
Alien 3," not bad except the CGI...
",I don't know why everyone completely hated this alien sequel. I liked it though not as much as the first and second. The acting is good and there's some new twists and turns in the story which is good I think because the second one did not do much for story.This one follows Ellen Ripley after her escape ship she ended with in the second movie crashes into a prison. She finds out her friends in the ship are dead and since it is a very isolated prison she is stuck there.This one is not as good as the first or second but it is still a solid movie I liked it. If your a fan of the alien movies you will like this the only bad thing is the computer animation is terrible because the movie is so old. They should have just stuck with robotics.,6,0,1,14 October 2012
Antz," A great movie!
",This is one of the movies I used to watch over and over again as a kid and I still love it even now. The animation was great for the day and the writing is great with many humorous parts and a great storyline. This movie is also backed by an all star cast which you don't really see too often in an animated movie.This movie is about an ant named Zee who is a part of an ant colony when he figures out a terrible secret lead by the general of the ant colony that not even the queen knows about.This really is a perfect film for all ages. It has a great cast great writing and it makes it a very enjoyable movie. If you have kids or are just a fan of a good animated movie this one is for you.,7,1,1,23 November 2012
Lucky Number Slevin," Very unique and enjoyable movie
","This movie is very out of the ordinary i don't know quite whether to classify it as a thriller, action or drama i feel as if it has all components which makes it a great watch.This is a movie about mistaken identity. Slevin (hartnett) finds himself mistaken for somebody else and is cornered by two rival crime bosses in the city. He finds himself having to figure out a way to get to the crime bosses before they get to him.This is a very good movie. It is very unpredictable and is filled with great actors. Pay attention to the story line because it is kind of complex but very unique and ingenious.",Null,4,6,29 July 2011
Requiem for a Dream," Too intense for words..
","Words cannot really describe this movie its just great. This movie is definitely not easy to watch though as it deals with drugs and the effects it has on peoples lives. The acting is really good, the script is great followed by a very intense screenplay.This movies is about 4 people who live on Coney island that are drugs users but their world is shattered when their addictions become stronger.This movie is very good. It is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. It will have your heart racing and have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It really shows the horrors of drug use and how it ruins peoples lives. The things that this movie shows are brutal and make you want to look away. A very powerful emotional film experience. This film is not for the faint of heart but it is definitely a masterpiece in the world of modern cinema.",Null,0,1,5 September 2011
The Expendables 2," Not good at all? 7.1? wtf
",I was never a real big fan of the first Expendables seeing how it was just another run of the mill boring action flick. Guns being shot cheesy jokes and not the best of actors and I decided to see this one for some reason..big mistake that was. This one was even worse then the first one and for some reason it got a 7.1 on here. It did not even have good action sequences obviously the whole budget went to pay the salaries because this was terrible. They made jokes that didn't even derive from the plot but were just from other movies....Awful...If you liked the first expendables stay away from this one because it is a lot worse so basically the only reason you should watch this if you onlu like pointless action movies.,4,0,0,22 November 2012
Source Code," Pretty cool idea not bad thriller.
","This movie I thought had a pretty neat idea. It was unique and had me guessing the whole way through. I did find however the story kind of got a little convoluted for my liking but it was not too bad. The acting as well could have been a bit better but for the most part it was a good film.This movie is about a man (Gyllenhaal)who is sent back in time via some kind of transporter. He is sent back in time to try and find out who is to blow up the train that he is on. He has 8 minutes to find the terrorist. That is about all i can say of the movie without giving too much away. I will say though that this is a good thriller with a great idea. Its new, fun and will have you at the edge of your seat. Like I said the only thing i did not like about it was i thought near the end it kind of got convoluted but still made it quite easy to follow. overall NOT BAD",Null,0,1,27 July 2011
The Ring," A good original horror
",This movie was not the best horror movie I have ever seen but it is definitely one of the better supernatural ones that is for sure. The acting is well done and the movie does a great job of making a creepy atmosphere which most movies don't do these days. It does not rely on jump scares but actual scare built up by the story.This movie is about a young journalist who is sent to investigate a video tape which apparently causes the death within a week of anyone who watches it.This movie is actullay pretty good and I remember first seeing this movie when I was just a kid and I was terrified. There is lots of creepy moments in this movie that scare me to this day.,7,1,1,19 October 2012
Deja Vu," Just really couldn't get into this one.
",I still give this a six though because I could see how people liked it but I did not and heres why. I actually had not watched this movie until recently after already seeing the movie Source Code. Although these movies are not the same they are very similar and it just hung in my head because Source Code is better.That clearly is only opinion though. If you look at the facts is was above average. Denzel did a great job as always and it was an original idea I just feel Tony Scott (R.I.P) ;lacks writing in his films and tries to makes up for it with action.This movie is about an explosion that kills 500 people and the ATF send a man to find out who did it. While in fact they actually have this sort of time seeing device which they use to try to find it out.Overall this movie was not bad but like I said Source Code is better obviously a little less now though seeing how they ripped the idea off pretty hard.,6,0,1,9 November 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Favorite movie when I was a kid
","This movie brings back some great memories of my childhood. I used to watch this movie two or three times a week I liked it so much. The idea was so new and original,directed perfectly and for a 80s film the acting was actually quite good. It is a heartwarming talke that will make you laugh and then all the sudden tear up.This movie is about a young quiet boy named Elliot. One day Elliot hears a noise in his shed so he decides to go have a look.What he finds is what he least expects...something not from this world. The boy is scared at first but then learns he means no harm.This is such a sweet movie great for little kids or familes or just any fans of goof movies.",7,1,2,5 November 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Entertaining but very flawed.
","I put off watching this movie for one reason and that is the god awful title. But after reading many positive reviews on here I decided to give it a watch. First thing I will say is this movie was entertaining and if thats all I judged movies on I would have given this a much higher rating. Due to the fact I judge movies on a whole I give this pretty low and heres why.The acting is pretty atrocious. Some people will argue and say its good but it really isn't. The second thing is the constant inaccuracies such as making silver ball bearing for repeater rifles? which of course wouldn't work. Or ball bearings for revolvers....yes revolvers....Or the fact you see the vamps with a huge mouth of teeth but when they bite they only use the typical two sharp ones. Really makes no sense.This movie is about Abraham Lincoln as he is growing up and discovers there is vampires everywhere. He teams up with one to destroy the vampires and save America.This movie was OK but I wont give it another watch. The acting, the inaccuracies and the ridiculous action sequences make this movie pretty terrible. Everyone who liked this will have to explain to me why.",5,0,1,24 November 2012
Training Day," The reason Denzel won an Oscar
",This is my review of training day one of my favourite movies of all time and in my opinion one of the best movies ever made.This is the story of an up and coming beat cop (Hawke)who is striving to become a detective.To do so he has to spend some time first with an experienced detective. (Denzel) Though as the movie progresses you discover that his highly praised mentor is not all he is made out to be.This is hands down Denzels and Hawkes best performance followed by a very good script and solid directing. This is a must see for anyone who loves Denzel Hawke or crime dramas. See this movie,9,0,0,28 June 2011
In Bruges," Great comedy action!
",I had actually never heard of this movie before watching it for the first time the other night and let me start off by saying I was very pleasantly surprised. The acting was great Ferrel did an excellent job. And the way they mixed the comedy with an intense story I just loved it. The humor was actually really funny too.After hit-man Ray kills the wrong person during a hit his boss sends him to bruge to lay low and ease off some of the guilt of killing the innocent person.This movie was really good. It was a fresh interesting idea and it was hilarious and at the same time it was really brutal.,7,1,3,20 October 2012
Se7en," Terrific thriller!!!
","This movie was just awesome.A thriller that really leaves you on the edge of your seat the whole time your watching. It starts morgan freeman who always does a superb job, accompanied by brad pitt who always did an outstanding job. And to top it all off it was directed by David Fincher who has made some great movies.This movie is about two detectives (Freeman,Pitt) who are sent to invesitage a weird string of murders. There is a murderer killing people using the seven deadly sins as justification.Overall this movie was really good. Great actors, great story line and a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested. I really liked it.",7,4,5,14 October 2012
The Big Lebowski," So glad I rewatched this!
",I saw this movie for the first time about ten years ago and I guess I was too young to understand just how good it was because I have not seen it again since now. This movie is just perfect with outstanding writing from the cohen brothers who always find new ways to make interesting stories and quirky fun characters. With all the actors doing such a bang up belieavle job this movie does everything right.This movie is about jeffery lebowski (everyone calls the dude) (Bridges) an unemployed loser who does nothing pretty much other then bowl. One night two young thugs bust into his place thinking he was a million of the same name. After figuring out he wasn't they peed on his rug and took off. So the dude went to the million for compensation for his rug but when he gets there the old millionaire has a proposistion for him.This movie was just so good. It felt so real and believable mainly thanks to the awesome writing and acting. It is interesting and hilarious it really is a must see.,9,3,6,19 October 2012
Underworld," Interesting story just not for me.
",This movie was not all bad I mean the story was original. Thankfully something different with vampires. I just did not care much for the story line however the effects and acting was good it just was not what I was expecting.This movie is about a war between werewolves and vampires. One woman is a vampire but she falls in love with a werewolf who just wants the war to end.I know a lot of people really like this movie but I really don't. The story line was just kind of cliché and predictable and throwing a romance element in there just kind of ruined it.,5,2,7,26 October 2012
Dawn of the Dead," good movie poorly performed.
","This is a remake of the classic dawn of the dead and it does not a bad job of living up to the original. The story sticks close to the same but there is some things that botherd me. The acting is terrible by everyone except maybe one of the cast and the zombies run....which everyone knows is impossible. Other then that though its not bad, the action scenes are intense and gory for the zombie lover fan.This movie is about a woman who in the middle of the night is attacked by a little girl with some kind of disease. The girl bites he husband and gives him the disease which turns him into a flesh eating monster. She runs from him and ends up with a group of people who decide to go to the mall to try to survive agaisnt the hoards of the undead.This movie was pretty good besides the acting of course. The story line was good and there were some nice twists and turns. Quite entertaining with lots of zombie killing",6,0,3,19 October 2012
Iron Man 2," Not as good as the first but still good.
",This movie was pretty good. I really didn't like this one as much as the first one though. The acting was still great by Robert Downy Jr and there was still a bunch of action and jokes but it somehow feel short for me. I didn't feel as if the story line was as compelling but they did add Don Cheadle to the cast which is a nice addition.This movie takes after the first one and follows Tony Starks life as he trys to bring peace with his Iron man suit.This was a good movie but was not as good as the first. The bad guy in this movie was kind of boring so I did not like this much. As for the action though it was solid and it does give some more information after the first one which is nice so by all means go watch it.,Null,0,1,28 August 2011
Alien: Resurrection," the worst one but still a fun ride.
",This is the worst one of the series but that really is not saying much being that the previous movies are some of the best movies ever made. In this one its just a bit cheesy. The acting is not as well done and they add more computer animation which is poorly done.This movie is about Ellen Ripley 200 years after she killed herself in the prison. A ship found her and cloned her to extract the queen alien from her belly. They got it out and kept her alive but she breaks free as well do the aliens.This movie is not as good as the others. There is little to no story line but it is just really entertaining. The acting is kind of bad by some of the main cast but not too bad.,6,1,1,16 October 2012
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Absolutely hilarious!!
","This is probably my favorite comedy out there. This is just one of those comedies that has you laughing you butt off even after you have seen it 5 times +. It starts Jason Segel who is just hilarious he was also the righter of this laugh riot.It is about a man (Segel) who gets dumped by his girlfriend and does not handle it so well. He remembers a place in hawaii his Ex girlfriend said was a great place to relax. So he gets a flight out and wouldn't you guess it, whos there his ex girlfriend. Hilarious antics ensue as he tries to cope with being in the same resort and his ex girlfriend.This movie is just hilarious. It is filled with a bang up cast who make every comedy great. Everyone does a fantastic job and this is definitely one comedy you should put on the top of your too watch list. 9.5/10",Null,0,2,27 July 2011
The Hunger Games," Shaky camera and should have been a R rating
",A lot of people really liked this movie but I feel it only right to give it a five and here why. The camera is very shaky and unsteady its get very annoying and frankly does not match whats happening on screen. The acting is alright but the movie is also very predictable even though it has an original idea which blows my mind.This movie takes place in the not too distant future where North America has crumbled under war and famine now only one country remains and in that one country rest six districts. These districts every year are forced to send one pre-teen or teenager to battle 11 others from all other districts.This movie was not all bad but it would have been so much better with a R rating. If it were a lot darker it would have been much more interesting instead it was just annoying camera work.Also Im supposed to believe they pin 13 year old girls against 18 year old guys? Like I laughed when I heard that.,5,0,2,7 November 2012
Shaun of the Dead," Funny, gory ,perfect
",This is my review of Shaun of the dead. It is a horror/comedy that is very enjoyable to watch. It mixes my two favorite genres together to make a very laughable blood fest. This movie is about two friends (pegg and frost) who live together. They live boring lives until one day a zombie outbreak strikes. Of course like any other zombie movie it does not say how the infection started it just kind of appears. They do their best to survive the infestation they face by rounding up friends and going to their favorite pub.This movie is filled with laughs from pegg and frost (very good actors in comedies in my opinion) and it is also filled with lots of blood and gore to keep to the traditional zombie movie style.This movie is definitely worth a watch. I kind of think they should make another movie with the same characters but make it a vampire comedy and call it from dusk till shaun. What does everyone think?,Null,1,3,23 July 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Best Disney movie Id say
",I actually liked this movie quite a bit when it first came out and its still good to this day. Usually Disney goes for really childish movies but this one has more of a grown up feel and with a fun interesting story line and a great performance from Johnny Depp this movie becomes very enjoyable.This movie is about a blacksmith who teams up with pirate Jack Sparrow in order to save the love of his life who was kidnapped by Sparrows ex gang of pirates who are now undead monsters.I know the plot sounds kind of silly and strange but this movie is really enjoyable. Besides the countless historical errors if you blot those from your mind and just sit back and enjoy the ride it is very fun once all said and done with.,7,0,2,22 November 2012
Hostel," a lot better then people say
",I remember when this movie first came out and i went to see it in thetres and i remember it creeping the hell out of me. Though this movie is somewhat low budget the acting is good and the special effects are awesome. Contrary to everybodys beliefs this movie is really not that gory. It is brutal though but not anywhere as gory as people say I have definitely seen worse.This movie is about two American backpackers who plan on travelling across Europe. First they start off in Amsterdam but one night while locked out of their hotel they meet a guy who tells them that slovakia has the best and most beautiful girls in the world. So they catch the next train out to Slovakia. While there they stay at a youth hostel that has a sinister plan for all backpackers passing through.I found this movie really good. I really don't know why everyone hates these kinda of movies and quotes them 'toture porn' there is not much toture even in this. The scares are mostly set up through the creepy atmosphere. Of course there is some (very few like maybe 15 mins of the movie) brutal toture in the movie so if you have a weak stomach probably best stay away from this.Overall I think it was a good horror movie. The acting was fair and it was very creepy it wasn't all just about the toture. If you are a true horror fan you will like this. If you cant stand gore or brutal scenes Don't WATCH THIS.,Null,0,2,25 August 2011
Public Enemies," Great period crime piece
","This movie was quite a bit better then I expected. The acting was good which is what I expected seeing how Johnny Depp was in it and he is great. The thing that got me was I was very interested in the story and the characters the whole time thanks to very good writing.This movie is about The Feds as they try to take down notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd during a booming crime wave in the 1930s.This movie was very interesting and enjoyable to watch. All the actors did a really good job and the movie was entertaining which a lot of period pieces fail to be. Great movie give it a watch.",7,0,0,7 November 2012
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The best musical I have ever seen
",This is the feature movie from the award winning show south park and it is just hilarious. It is actually a musical filled with catchy musical numbers that of which I know all off by heart. Great voice acting from Stone and Parker and hilarious writing also from the two men make this movie a piece of comedy gold and a must see.This movie is about the four foul mouthed kids from South Park Colorado who see a movie from Canada called Terrance and Phillip. The movie uses some foul language which the boys quickly emulate and go along saying it front of parents teachers whatever. The parents are outraged with Canada and make America start a war with Canada.This movie is just hilarious filled with dirty jokes and lots of satire. Like the fact Americans get so mad at Canadians for having bad language on T.V where as they have brutal violence and for some reason think language is worse.Im kind of surprised this movie even got made as it was only a year or two after south parks creation. I would love it if they made a new south park movie with the humor of today in it I think that would be amazing.,7,0,0,22 November 2012
Ted," predictable story but very funny
","I saw this movie in the thetre last night and I just loved it, from the creator of family guy and American dad I was very excited and he did not disappoint.This movie is about a little boy named john .John doesn't have any friends and one day on Christmas after receiving and little stuffed bear for a gift he makes a wish to make that bear real. The movie carries on through johns adulthood as he tries to juggle between his best friend the bear or who girlfriend.This movie was really good and very funny. Seth macfarlene is so funny with everything he does and this movie is no exception. The cast is great with wahlberg and macfarlene doing the voice of the bear. The acting in the beginning segment is just atrocious but I feel that was intentional.Overall go see this movie it is very funny. Go see it in thetres before you miss out people. One of the best comedies ever for sure.",8,1,7,3 July 2012
Spider-Man 2," keeps going downhill...
",I really did not like the first one much but i decided to give this one a shot thinking that it may be a bit better. In fact is was much worse. The actors are much worse and its filled with more plot holes.This movie takes place after the first one following peter parker (spiderman) as he tries to live a normal life and be spiderman at the same time.This movie was not as good as the first one. At least in the first one you had the excitement of him becoming a super hero. In this one the story line is just boring and predictable. Once again I only recommend this for little kids,5,1,3,31 May 2012
Finding Nemo," Great animated movie.
",I have always like animated movies and as the time goes on to my delight the animation keeps getting so much better and this is one of the movies that depicts that. Everything looks so well done and easy on the eye its just great. The acting is good and the story line is heart warming with many humorous moments.This movie is about a young clown fish named Nemo who while on his first day of school gets snatched up by a diver. He is taken away and his father although terrified of the open ocean goes on a hunt for his only son.This movie is very enjoyable from start to finish. It will make you laugh and at the end it make you tear up. Just a great family movie or anyone who loves animation.,7,0,1,23 November 2012
Blade," Great vampire movie.
","Most vampire movies go the way of the horror but his however has more of an action movie quality. I like the horror style better but this movie was definitely a lot of fun. It stars Wesley Snipes who plays his part as Blade very well. The other actors do a fair job and the special effects and good.This movie is about a half vampire-half human named Blade. Blade has all the strengths of vampires with none of the weaknesses. He uses his powers to fight vampires and save all man kind from the growing vampire hoard.This movie is a very fun ride. It has great action and special effects, the gore is pretty good too. This movie is very entertaining i would suggest it to anyone who loves vampire or action flicks.",Null,0,1,5 September 2011
Hot Fuzz," Simon Pegg and Nick Frost great duo but not as good as shaun of the dead.
","Nick Frost and Simon Pegg always do such great movies together(except for Paul that is...Yikess)they have such natural chemistry and are a very funny dou. This movie has a great story line and the dry but yet witty British humor gives it a nice edge.Jealous colleagues conspire to get a top London cop transferred to a small town and paired with a witless new partner. On the beat, the pair stumble upon a series of suspicious accidents and events.This movie is great but personally I would have to say its not better then Shaun of the dead. Maybe that is because I have a soft spot for the horror genre but that is my opinion.",6,0,0,28 October 2012
The Mummy," A fun adventure
",This is my review on the first installment of the mummy movies. I remember seeing this when I was younger and just absolutely loving it. As I grew though I figured out that it was not as great as i once thought.This movie is about a man (fraser) who is on death row when he is saved by a lady looking for the city of the dead 'hamunatra'. Fraser says he knows where to find it as hes been there previously. So the women saves him from a certain death sentence so he promised to show her the way. Once there they discover an ancient tomb accompanied by an ancient book. Little to their knowledge the tomb and the book have a curse that they will unknowingly unleash upon the world.This movie is not for everybody. If you are a hardcore movie buff such as myself then you probably wont enjoy it. I enjoy it so much because i grew up with it. The story line is pretty basic and the acting is above average. Im not usually a big fan of fraser but I feel he did an alright job here. This movie is filled with action and thrilling moments. If you have kids this is a great one for them.Overall I say its worth a watch. It is a fun adventure to sit along and go for the ride. Though it is predictable and somewhat cliché I still find it quite enjoyable. If this seems like the movie for you watch it if not best bet is probably don't waste your time.,Null,1,1,23 July 2011
The Others," Not as good as everyone says.
",I actually had never seen this movie up until last night but I had nothing else to watch so I decided to give it a try because everyone seemed to love it on here. First thing the acting in it is good from everyone except the little girl. The plot is quite good with an interesting original twist however the movie is quite slow and dull for me.I thought it was going to be somewhat scary and it was not at all.This movie is about a young family in England circa 1940s. The father has gone off to war and the mother is forced to stay at home and take care of her children who have a rare disease which makes them ultra alergic to the sunlight. Strange things start to happen though as the kids start to see ghosts.This movie was OK it was just a little boring for me. Slow and dull just like most English things. Still more exciting then Paranormal Activity of course.,6,2,4,11 December 2012
Troy," solid entertainment
",This movie is quite long but very intense the whole way through. It has a good story line fair acting and some amazing production values. This movie has some of the best battle scenes I have ever seen in a movie like this and I have seen a lot.This movie is about a young prince of troy (Orlando Bloom) who destroys his fathers peace treaty with Sparta when he steals the kings wife away from him. The angry king gets all the men of Greece and launches the largest army ever seen at the time. !000 ships 50000 men all to the beaches of troy. The trogans get ready and prepare to defend their home.This movie is great. Brad pitt did a great job and so did everybody else except Eric bana. The battle scenes were very well done and extremely intense I recommend this movie to anyone who likes old war movies.,7,13,19,20 May 2012
Orphan," better then I expected
",I came into this movie thinking it was going to be pretty lame. I was not blown away or anything but it was actullay pretty good. With solid performances by the cast and a pretty interesting story with some twists and turns.This movie is about a young couple who want to adopt a child. They go to the orphanage and they come across a young foreign girl about 10 years old. She seems very smart and well spoken so they decide to adopt her. She works out great at first but she starts to act stranger and stranger.This movie is pretty decent. I mean its worth a watch is just not anything special. It does not make your heart race as much as it should probably.,6,2,3,17 October 2012
My Neighbor Totoro," very strange anime from my childhood
",I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and up until now I have never seen this movie in my adult life and let me tell you wow this is weird. I know all anime movies are strange but this one is really something else.This movie is about a young girl who finds a monster/animal thing. She names it totoro and they go on all kinds of adventures together being that this creature has magical powers.This movie was really good it was just really strange. If you can I suggest watching the jap version though as the dubbed version is acted very poorly as dubbed versions usually are.,6,0,5,21 October 2012
Spider-Man 3," The worst one yet
",Uhggg this franchise just keeps disappointing me. I used to love the spiderman cartoon when I was little and these movies are just ruining it for me.This movie follows peter parker as he finds this new power. The whole movie is about him trying to find out whether to be good and evil. This really was the worst one. The story dragged on and on. The plot was convuloted and ridiculous. They should have focused more on one bad guy and one theme instead of like 5. This movie was just all over the place and the special effects really don't seem to improve on these movies do they?,4,2,4,31 May 2012
Zodiac," Serial killer movie with a great plot.
",This is one of my favorite serial killer movies. Its not a slasher or anything like that more of a crime thriller. The actors all did a very good job and the plot was interesting exspecially seeing how it was based on a true story. They took the real life plot and turned it into a very interesting movie.This movie is the true story about the Zodiac killings that happened in San Fransisco in the 60s and 70s. Detectives struggle to find out who it is when victim after victim keep being discovered.This movie was really good I really think David Fincher did a great job as well as Jake Gyllenhall. If you like a good crime mystery story then this is definitely for you. Great movie.,7,0,0,21 November 2012
Cloverfield," Why all the hatred?
",This is my review on Cloverfield. Now let me first say that this in no way is a perfect movie but I do not think it deserves all the trash talk that it gets from people. I think the acting from most of the cast was great and it deserves a watch.This movie is about a group of friends that live in New York city (big surprise I know) So during a going away party they are throwing the city is attacked by something. They strive together to try and survive the turmoil making their way through the city.Now I have heard many complaints about this movie. First off being thats it shot from the handi-cam type of view. So in that light there is little back story on the characters and very little information on the monster. Though I find it much better that way personally. It feels as if you are in the movie. Think about it if we were attacked we would not have any information on the monster so I think it feels right. It is way better then any other sci-fi flick with some cheezy back story.Another common complaint is that the monster looks ridiculous. In my opinion thats the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Who knows what kind of creatures lie in the great vastness of space. Not me not you not anyone. The monster could literally be anything.Bottom line this movie is not perfect there is little story line and even less character development. Even though those movies are not usually for me this one had its perks. I thought it was a fun ride and if you are looking a brainless thriller you can just sit and enjoy then this is for you.,Null,0,1,22 July 2011
Sleepy Hollow," eerily beautiful
",This movie is typical Tim Burton style but this has got to be one of his best movies. The special effects and visual effects are amazing and the cinematography is stunning. The only real flaw with this movie in my opinion is the story line but that had nothing to do with Tim Burton as this story already existed..This movie is about a young detective who is sent from the city to invesitage 3 murders in a small town. He goes there with a logical frame of mind but as rumors from the towns people include a headless horseman he is forced to think outside the box as this might be true.This movie was pretty good just not the best. I frankly don't like the story line but the way Burton did it was stunning. He made it very visually pleasing and that has to be the best part followed closely by Depps acting who is always great.,6,0,0,26 October 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Not as good as I would have hoped
",Now I will start off first by saying that this movie had incredible animation. To the point where everything looked nearly lifelike probably the best animation I have ever seen and definitely the best part of this movie. The acting was good and it was directed by Spielberg so you have a very well put together movie here I just did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I thought they would have it be kind of funny and it seems like they did but its more of a very dry humor.This movie is about a reporter named TinTin who teams up with Captain Haddock to find a treasure ship that belonged to captain Haddocks ancestors.This movie was not all bad and it was a fun adventure and you could tell they spent a lot of time making it. However the story line just was not as gripping or funny as I had hoped however thats my opinion Im sure to lots its a perfect movie.,6,1,2,23 November 2012
The Beach," pretty good!
",This is another leo dicaprio movie and it did not disappoint. I know that this is based on a novel and though i haven't read it i liked this movie. Though my reading the reviews on here apparently if you read the book you probably wont like this as the story has changed drasticly.This is about a man (Dicaprio) who goes on his search on a tropical island in Thailand that is apparently a paradise. He and a couple friends venture off to go find it. Once they find it however they find many people already living there who are not to fond of newcomers. This is a pretty good movie. Not Leos best by any means but it was still alright. Apparently this doesn't follow the book closely at all so if you have read it i would suggest you avoid this one. If you are looking for a well acted movie with some beautiful scenery then you will like this.,Null,0,1,23 August 2011
The Expendables," Not a bad action movie.
",This movie was your pretty basic run of the mill action stooper. The kind of movie that you can only really watch with your brain turned off or it becomes very repetitive and boring. It has a lot of your action stars actually pretty much everyone of them and thats about the only good thing about this movie. The action sequences are OK but the story line is so cliché and unoriginal that it just makes the movie boring.This movie is about a group of mercenaries who are sent to Latin American to assaisnate a military leader.This movie was not all bad but I found it just to be so boring cliché and predictable. Maybe if they had added a story line instead of just relying on the sub par acting skills of their all meat head cast.,6,0,2,22 November 2012
Final Destination 2," A great sequel
","I really liked the first Final Destination movie and I think this one blew it out of the water. I have to say some of actors are pretty bad but the idea is fun and they always think of new crazy ways to kill people.This movie is about a young girl who has a vision on a highway that ultamitly ends up saving a few peoples lives. They are all grateful to be alive but soon end up dieing one by one as they think something didn't want them to survive in the first place.This was a very solid sequel, really entertaining and fun to watch. It had you sitting on the edge of your seat and the deaths were hilariously gruesome.",7,3,4,17 October 2012
Blade II," Even better then the first.
",I watched this movie because i really enjoyed the first and this one did not disappoint. I thought it was even better with much creepier moments and effects.This movie takes after the first one and follows the half human-half vampire killing machine Blade. He is slaughtering vampires as usual but then he discovers there is something worse then vampires on the streets now. They spread the disease much faster and the whole human race is at risk.This movie is great. I liked it even better then the first mainly because of the new vampires scared the heck out of me when i was little and first watched this. Very good movie if you liked the first go watch this.,Null,1,6,5 September 2011
Alien," A classic that i love.
","This movie is definitely one of the best horror movies of all time. It is one of the few classics that i say should NEVER remade. The acting is good, it is quite an older film but the special effects are solid. The movie uses a creepy atmosphere and solid scares unlike movies today.This movie is about a mining ship who lands on a distant planet responding to an SOS (of course this is many years in the future). Once on the planet they explore and find a crashes spacecraft. The orgin is unknown but they go aboard and discover hundreds of eggs. They soon find out these eggs have strange creatures in them.This movie is great exspecially for the fact it was filmed in 1979. If you are a true horror fan and you haven't seen this movie you cant really even call yourself a true horror fan. Go watch this movie guys.",Null,1,3,5 September 2011
Horrible Bosses," Good movie but I wish it had more funny moments.
",I watched this movie last night after being very excited for it and although it was not as funny as I thought it would be it was still very funny perhaps my expectations were just too high. The story line and the writing were very original and clever making this movie hilarious and interesting. All the actors did a great job and there were so laugh out loud moments.This movie is about 3 friends who each has a horrible boss. They are sick and tired of always being treated like doormats so they come up with a plan to kill each others bosses so that they wont be linked to the crime in anyway.This movie has a fun new idea and it has a wealth for great comedy actors. If your a comedy fan this is a must see.,7,0,1,22 November 2012
The Town," easily Ben Aflecks best!
",This movie is easily one of the best of the year. It has a great story line great performances by all actors. Even Afleck in the best role of his life.This movie is about a long time thief who has a relationship with a bank teller. Within the movie he preforms many robberies but as the movie progresses he has to decide if this is really what he wants from life or if he wants more.This movie is very intense. It has great scenes that leave you at the edge of your seat. If you love a good action drama then this one is for you. I would recommend this movie to everyone go watch it if you haven't,Null,0,0,27 July 2011
Taxi Driver," Scorsese and De Niro best team in history.
","Everyone movie Scorsese does is just gold. That being the case De Niro is in about 90% of them and he contributes to this a lot. He is such a fantastic actor and this movie is one of his best. Scorsese and De Niro are everything Tim Burton and Johnny Depp wish they could be.This movies about A mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran works as a nighttime taxi driver in New York City where the perceived decadence and sleaze feeds his urge to violently lash out, attempting to save a teenage prostitute in the process.This movie was just chilling from start to finish. It is not a horror but just has a very disturbing undertone to it. Very well directed and the actors did a very great job even jodey foster as the child prostitute.",8,0,0,16 October 2012
Shutter Island," Scorsese not your best.
",I love Martin Scorsese and I love Leo but I have to tell you I did not love this. Don't get me wrong the acting and direction was amazing. You cant expect anything less from this team of cinema masters. Though I though the story line fell a little short.This movie is about a detective who goes to an insane asylum to investigate a missing person. When he gets there he soon starts to discover weird things going on and even weirder leads leading him to the missing person.I thought this movie was alright. Let me tell you first that if it ended 20 minutes sooner I would have given it a lot higher of a rating. It is just not like Scorsese to make a movie like this and for that i was highly disappointed. Overall though if you have an open mind and don't know much about Scorsese then this one is probably fine for you. If you love classic Scorsese Im not sure this one will do it for you.,Null,0,1,27 July 2011
Full Metal Jacket," A great gritty wartime epic!
","This movie was just outstanding. The acting was great exspecially by the drill sergeant god do I love him. I feel the first half was a bit better then the second half but it was still an awesome movie. It showed the horrors of war and what they go through.A pragmatic U.S. Marine observes the dehumanizing effects the Vietnam War has on his fellow Marine recruits from their brutal boot camp training to the bloody street fighting set in 1968 in Hue, Vietnam.This is one of the best war movies of all time everyone should see it. The actors all did such a great job it was very enjoyable. It could have used a bit more action in the second half but the first half was great.",8,0,1,16 October 2012
Forrest Gump," My favorite movie
","I know a lot of people may disagree but i find this to be the best movie ever made. The script, the direction and most of all Tom Hanks stunning performance made this movie perfect for me.This movie is about a slightly mentally challenged man (Hanks) who finds himself parts of very memorable parts of history. He tries to do his best and thats exactly what happens. As the story goes on he finds himself doing amazing things throughout the world.This is an amazing movie. Its touching, its breathtaking, its filled with action sequences, its exciting, i could go on forever because this ovie literally has everything you could want and more. There is a reason this movie won 6 Oscars in won award because it is hands down the best movie ever made.

21 Jump Street," consistently funny throughout.
",This movie was just great. It does not have the most laugh of loud moments in a comedy but it will have you laughing the whole way.

After training they get put into an undercover program and guess what they are going back to high school This movie is filled with great scenes great acting and funny moments. It is not the funniest movie i have ever seen but pretty darn close. As long as you don't mind a little bit of foul launguage you will love this movie.,8,1,2,30 May 2012
Fargo," My favorite Cohen film.
","This movie has got to be one of my favorites in my collection. The Cohen brothers always make good movies but this one in my eye definitely takes the cake. The script is gold, so very believable and hilarious. Every single actor in this movie played their parts so well I think H. Macy really did a great job as well as Buscemi.This movie is about a man who needs money so he tries to scam his rich father in law to pay a ransom to two men he hired to kidnapp his wife. The kidnappers hit the road as Jerry is put under more and more pressure.This movie is not only my favorite Cohen films it is in my top ten.

Predator," classic Shawrzenegger action!

Arny can not really act but this movie he is not saying overly much he does what he does best and stands around looking menacing. This movie is intense action from pretty much the start to finish and it was really ahead of its time.This movie is about a group of special ops soldiers who go to south America to go on a mission. While on the mission they start going missing one by one and soon discover they are being hunter by something not of this world.This is a great classic action movie and its one of Arnies best for sure.,7,1,2,26 October 2012

It has great comedic moments and hilarious actors and writing.The story line to this movie is very simple and straight forward. 4 friends who are in high school and still are virgins make a packed that they will all lose their virginity by prom night. Of course a bunch of wild antics ensue that keeps the audience laughing.If you have not seen this movie then you are not a fan of comedies nor movies.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Boring adventure filled with holes.
","Everyone loves this movie so much and I have no idea why. I remember when this movie first came out and everybody was so excited to see it (me being one of them) then i sat through all 3 hours of it to find out what a waste of time it was. Yes the acting is not bad, the special effects and obviously incredible and it is definitely creative but it is just too slow for me.After watching the whole trilogy I have found numerous holes in the story. I will not post them in this review though as not to make spoilers. As far as im concerned this movie sucks but many people like it. If you don't like long movies with very little action then you probably will not like this.",Null,0,1,25 August 2011
28 Weeks Later," Better then the first!
",This is the sequel to 28 days later and let me tell you that this one was better. I really liked the idea the first one came out with but the movie just did not play through like I had hoped so I didn't much care for it. This one on the other hand was great.The story line is actually believable which is crazy for a 'zombie' movie. The acting is done very well and there is some heart racing moments in it as well.This movie is about two young kids who are going back to England after the majority of the disease from the first one has been quarantined and eliminated. Until the mother of the young kids is found and she has the once thought eliminated disease.This movie was really good. It was very intense unlike the first one and it leaves you on the edge of your seat. If you liked the first one watch this and you will like it even more.,7,1,3,17 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A little close to the book then the 6th
","Finally my review for the last installment of Harry Potter well part one anyway. First I would like to say how glad I am they released this movie in two parts. I personally think they should have done that with every book after the third if they did they would have been able to make it much closer to the book and therefore and much better and complete movie like this one was. The acting was the best yet out of all the movies and the story is getting very intense also it seems the writing has improved drastically with the dialouge and screenplay.This movie is about Harry, Ron and Hermoine who instead of going to Hogwarts for their last year decide to finish Dumbledores work and go on the hunt for the horcuxes so they can kill Voldemort.This movie was probably my favorite one. It is definitely the most intense and with the most adult content and don't get me wrong there is still tons of stuff left out from the book but I personally think this one is a better adaptation then the 6th installment.",7,1,1,14 November 2012
The Hills Have Eyes," Great horror movie!
",I remember first seeing this movie when it came out in thetres. I was quite young back then but i remember that it being pretty scary. The acting is good like surprisingly good for a horror movie. It is not too high of budget but the special effects are very good.This movie is about a family traveling across America. They stop for gas at a local gas station and a man tell them there is a short cut to their destination. They decide to listen to the man and take the short cut. On their way on it they blow out their tires and get straded in the middle of the desert they soon figure out they are not alone.This movie was a really good slasher flick.

If you like a good slasher this is for you!!,Null,0,2,15 August 2011
The Shining," Best Steven King movie by far.
",This movie will always be one of the best classic horror films ever made. Probably due to the fact that the book was so good. Even though they made many Steven King books into movies and none of them were quite as good as this one. The acting by nickleson was very good the woman who played his wife was no good I thought but the child actor was great.This is about a writer who goes and takes a job as a caretaker for a giant mansion. While inside this mansion weird things start to happen as he starts to lose his mind.This movie was really good. It was made back in the day where horror movies actullay had style and substense. Where are the chills are real built from atmosphere and not just jump scenes. This is a must see for true horror fans.,7,1,2,16 October 2012
American Beauty," Just awesome

He lives without purpose and is no way happy with his life. He soons discovers that he does not have to live his life in the unfofilling way that he has been.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," one of my favorites.
","This is one of my favorite movies from the 90s. I have seen it dozen of times and i love it every time. It is far superior to the first with better actors plot and special effects of course. There is a lot of plot holes but any movie that deals with time travel is bound to have those because of the impossible concept.This movie is about a terminator sent back to protect sarah connors son John Connor. Unlike the first one where a terminator is sent to kill sarah. John from the future,reprogrammed the terminator to go back in time to protect him. Also sent back is a T-1000(a more advanced terminator)to kill john connor by cyberdine(the all knowing computer that rules the world in the future)This movie is filled with great performances from Edward Furlong and especially Arnold Shwarzanegger who easily put on his best performance of his life. Due to the fact mainly that he did not talk much and acted like an emotionless robot(much to his acting ability) Anyone who likes Arnold or a good action/drama should definitely watch this.",Null,0,0,23 July 2011
Apocalypse Now," One of the best movies of all time.

Now I really could not understand what was happening for the most part back then but I remember loving it and to this day I still love it. The acting is really good, the plot line is great. With out a doubt on of the best war movies of all time.During the on-going Vietnam War, Captain Willard is sent on a dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who has set himself up as a god among a local tribeMost war movies these days are pretty much just action films. This one is something different it does have action and intense moment but it has solid writing as well.

Disturbia," A good thriller.

Under house arrest it leads to serious boredome which leads the boy to start keep tabs on his neighbours for entertainment. As he keeps an eye on one of them he starts to think he is a killer that the police have been looking for for a long time.This is a good movie. It does all it can with a pg-13 rating and it does it well. The story is realistic and believable and the cast all does a great job.,6,0,1,17 October 2012
Spider-Man," not very good at all
",This is for sure the best of the series but it still fails in my opinion. The acting is nothing special as with the 'special effects' the story line is riddled with holes and problems.This movie is about a teenager who is on a class field trip when a spider suddenly bites him. The spider somehow mixes with his dna and makes him into a super hero.This movie just missed the mark for me. I liked it a lot more the first time i watched it but with every viewing i see more and more problems with it. I really only recommend to little kids or people that aren't prone to point out plot holes.,6,0,1,31 May 2012
Collateral," Tom Cruise at his best!
",This has to be hands down one of if not the best performance by Cruise. In many of his films he is nothing special but this oe he certainly stands out as the star and with a strong supporting role from Jamie Fox this movie turned out great. It had a new intriguing story line and solid direction and dialouge.This movie is about a cab driver who one night picks up a nicely dressed man. This man pays him well and makes him take him all over town little does the cab driver know this man is actually a hit-man and he is driving him to kill people.This movie was really good and with just two main actors there is no bad side actors to screw up the movie. This is a very intense thriller and everybody should watch it,8,1,1,21 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Better then the first two
",This addition to the franchise is quite a bit better then the last two. The other two were pretty boring and childish and this one is somewhat more exciting. This is where the acting starts to get better to which is enjoyable.This movie follows Harry Potter as he goes back to Hogwarts and guess what once again he is in danger and hogwarts is in parrell. A serial killer has escaped azkaban a magic prison for the worst of the worst of criminals. This so called serial killer searches for harry potter with some unlikely news.This was the best of the three movies so far but they left even more out of this one. They need like a three and half hour runtime to make a decent movie with this.,6,0,0,7 November 2012
Bad Teacher," Had its moments but not enough.
",I watched this movie the other night because I was rather bored and I heard from a couple friends(not the most experienced movie goers) that it was funny so I decided to give it a try. Its kind of a fun original story line and the actors all do a good job but it is simply not funny enough. There was probably at max about three times where I found myself chuckling and thats about it.This movie is about a fowl mouthed unprofessional junior high teacher who is dumped by her sugar daddy so if forced to work for herself. That is until she picks out a new rich man she wants to manipulate into being her new sugar daddy.This movie is alright for a one time watch but I wont be watching it again thats for sure. A couple laughs make this hard;y a comedy at all and thats all it was supposed to have going for it.,5,1,4,22 November 2012
Aliens," Great movie!
",I have been watching the movie since I was a kind and even after probably about 50-100 viewings I can still watch it and enjoy it very much. James Camerson directed this one and kind of changed it into more of an action movie instead of a horror movie which I was kind of disappointed about.This movie takes place after the first one following the Ellen Ripley the only surivor from the first movie. She is recruited by the marines to help them with the same possible aliens that may have taken over a terraforming colony.This movie is awesome I will always love it. I like all the films in the series. Aliens resurrection is where they kind of lost it. Watch thie movie,9,2,5,14 October 2012
The Fast and the Furious," good movie ruined by terrible actors.
",I give this movie a six because it really is a pretty good movie. The story line is new and interesting and it is very entertaining in my opinion the actors just ruin it though. Paul Walker and Vin desiel can not act at all so everything seems so fake and unbelievable just because of them.This movie is about an undercover cop who goes undercover to infiltrate an underground street racing ring. Though as his friendships with these people grow closer and closer he slips from being a cop to being a criminal.This movie was still pretty good even despite the robot like acting of walker and deseil. Overall I still think its worth a watch.,6,1,4,21 October 2012
The Exorcist," A great classic horror
",This is one of the best horror films ever made it was so ahead of its time for special effects acting and just pure horror factor. I saw this movie first when I was young and it still creeps me out. They really don't make them like this anymore.This movie is about a young girl who one day starts acting strange. She starts acting stranger and stranger so her mother takes her into a doctor to see if anything is wrong. The doctor cant find anything so soon as the girl gets worse the mother considers the extreme and has an exorcism.This movie was really good and very creepy. The special effects were great for the year and it really is just an entertaining movie. If your horror fan you must see it.,8,2,3,26 October 2012
Goon," just above average
",This movie is not bad at all but it is definitely nothing special. It has some pretty good acting by all the cast and some good scenes but it has a lack of a good plot and script.This movie is about under achieveing bouncer doug who finds out he is a great hockey fighter. So a hockey team takes him on as their 'goon' someone who just fights. As he plays he continues to get better and becomes a real hockey player.This movie is not bad but its not really funny. There is a couple chuckles here and there but the script in my opinion is poor. Gratuitous laungage and not many jokes make it poor in my mind.Over all not bad movie worth watching if you like hockey and are Canadian otherwise i wouldn't recommend it.,6,2,4,30 May 2012
American History X," Just amazing..
",This is my review of American History X. This is a masterpiece in the world of cinema. In my opinion one of the best movies ever made with stunning performances from the whole cast exspecially Edward Norton. Edward Norton is just one of those amazing actors of our time who can play any role and play it perfectly.American history X is about a skinhead (Norton) who is basically the leader of the skinhead group. Until one day he goes to jail for a serious crime. He comes out reformed just to find out his younger brother (Furlong) has been brainwashed by the same people who brainwashed him. This movie revolves around the older brother (Norton)trying to help his brother find out that this is not the right way to be.This is an amazing movie filled with heart racing sequences and excellent performances by all the actors involves. The script is just outstanding and the direction is even better. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of dramas or Edward Norton. Very two big thumbs up,9,0,1,28 June 2011
Saw III," not as good as 1&2 but still decent.
",It seems after more then one sequel movies start to go stale. This one did not necessarily have that effect because they managed to add new twists and turns to the story which actually led me to believe they were planning sequels from day 1 with the saw franchise.This movie takes place with the jigsaw killer still on the lose. He is sick and on his death bed so he kidnaps a doctor and makes her keep him alive if she fails she will die. As she tries to keep him alive jigsaw trains his hopeful predecessor.This movie was not as good as the first two but it was still pretty good. The acting was not very good but it was very entertaining wih even more brutal kills.,6,0,2,20 October 2012
Ocean's Eleven," Great movie with a great cast
","This is a great movie with a ton of great actors the main cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. The rest of the cast has a lot of big names too which all pull off their performances very well. The movie is really entertaining accompanied by some terrific writing. The story is original and fun it will keep you entertained until it blows your mind at the end.This movie is about a thief named danny ocean(Clooney) who gets out of prison and right away is anxious to set up a new 'job'. He recruits 11 of the finest career criminals around and they plan the ultimate never before done robbing of a Las Vegas casino.This movie is really good but it is strange because I have never bothered to watch the sequels mainly for the reason that Im scared its going to be too much like this one. Overall though great acting, great story and a great movie.",7,0,2,18 November 2012
Die Hard 2," A strong sequel
",This movie is not as good as the first one but it is still very entertaining. Willis is back and he does a good job. Seems like he purposely acts the way he does in this because I have seen him do a better job.This movie follows John Mclain(Willis) the hero from New York city who stopped the German terrorists. This time however rouge members of the military are using their powers to try and take over the airport. It is up to Mclain to stop them.This movie is good but its a lot like the first one. Just straight action not much of a story line but like the first one just a lot of fun thats made for watching with the boys having some beers.,6,0,1,16 October 2012
Resident Evil," not bad but I was hoping they would take a different route.
",This movie was not that bad but I was just hoping they would kind of stick to the video game and make it more like a horror movie instead they took a different route and made it like an action movie which greatly disappointed me.This movie is about a special military unit who is sent to fight a super computer and hundrerds of scientists that have been infected with a disease that turns them into flesh eating monsters.This movie was pretty good it was surely entertaining enough. The acting could have been better and I would of like to see some elements of the video game in there but overall not bad.,6,1,1,26 October 2012
Alien vs. Predator," not a good tribute to 'Alien' or predator.
",I grew up watching the Alien and the predator movies and I really liked them. So I thought this one might be a good addition to these franchises but man was I wrong. The acting was terrible along with terrible dialouge and screenplay. To top it all off it only has a PG-13 rating.This movie is about a group of scientists who are hired by Walon Untany to investigate an ancient structure he discovered. This ancient structure is 1000 feet below the ice in Antartica. They go to investigate it and soon discover they are caught inbetween a war of two Alien species.This movie was just not good whats so ever. Its an embarrassment to all the other movies and it just has zero entertainment value.,5,0,1,26 October 2012
No Country for Old Men," Another masterpiece by the Coen brothers.
",Every time the Coen brothers come out with a movie I am blown away. This one is a little more Hollywood and mainstream but it still has the very solid writing and direction skill of the Coens. All the actors did a very good job and the story line was original.This movie is about a man who while hunting one day comes upon a bunch of vehicles parked in the desert. As he approachers the vehicles he notices there is dead bodies in them. He searches around the vehciles and finds a big bag full of money along with a bunch of guns. He takes the money and the guns and hides them little to his knowledge a hit-man is already on his way to retrieve the money back from the man.This movie is another great film by the Coens I don't think they will ever fail. Probably one of the best if not the best movie of 2008 give this one a watch people.,8,2,2,20 October 2012
Bridesmaids," not bad but....
",I was really reluctant to see this movie even after hearing positive things. Mainly because of the all female cast. Not that I have anything against women its just mainly because I knew they would be making jokes more centered around girls and likewise to the story line. This could have been hangover with women and been hilarious but they did what I knew they would and put in romance and touching moments and jokes mainly centered at women.This movie is about a woman who has a friend who is going to get married and the friend asks her to be a bridemaid. They go to the wedding were craziness ensues.This movie was alright and it did have a couple funny moments but this is not a movie for me thats for sure. I will not be giving this another watch and I really only recommend for women or if you have a girlfriend who wants to see it and you know it will close the deal.,6,0,2,22 November 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Not your best Spielberg
","Now i know people are going to just despise me for saying this movie was not spielbergs best. Don't get me wrong, i love spielbergs work and i love tom hanks and matt damon but this movie although beautifully shot and with some of the most intense action sequences ever portrayed in a movie i feel as though the characters lost me. They did not grip my interest i did not care of them as i normally do in a movie such as this. I felt myself not caring when characters were killed which really disappointed me. Spielberg tries to make you care for them by overly long scenes in which they talk about their past i however found these scenes boring and had didn't have me caring any more. This movie is about a squad in world war 2 that is sent to save a man who had lost all his 3 brothers in the war. Since he was the only son left in his family the government made a decision to send a group of men to go save the last remaining son (Damon) of course on the way they lose men and face trials of humanity.Even though what i said above i still highly recommend this movie to everyone. Its just that i have such high expectations from spielberg and hanks so in my opinion it was kind of a let down though i may be the only person on earth who thinks so. So by all means go watch this one friends",7,0,0,23 July 2011
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A great comedy.
",This movie may be low budget but it is without a doubt one of the best horror comedies out there. Tyler Labine did such a good job and I think hes soo funny I wish he was in more movies. The other actors did good too and the story was just so new and original and funny.This movie is about two southern men..tucker and dale..They are your typical southern hillbillies and while at a gass station they scare a group of judgmental college kids. They see the college kids later at his delapidated 'vacation' home where things start to go bad.Don't watch the trailer before this movie because it does spoil a lot of it. Just watch this movie and trust me you will love it. Horror movie fans or comedy fans will both enjoy it.,7,0,1,26 October 2012
28 Days Later...," Very original idea but...
",This movie is pretty good but for some reason I just did not like it that much. It is a very good original idea and the acting and direction is done well I just feel it slowed down a bunch and never picked up again after the beginning.This movie is about a man who wakes up in a hospital only to find out he is all alone. He wanders onto the street where he discovers that a strange disease has wiped out everybody.This movie was not all bad but I think it lost it near the end. The movie started off really strong then kind of got boring in my opinion. The sequel is better.,6,2,4,17 October 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Best planet of the apes ever.
",I know a lot of people were very weary of this movie after hearing about it after that last modern planet of the apes was made back in 2000. That movie was absolutely terrible and this one totally redeemed it. James Franco does a great job and the apecial effects are terrific. The best part about this movie is the story for sure its such a touching and emotional story.This movie is about a young research scientist who is studying on chimps to try to make a injection that makes you smarter. He succeeds and uses it on a Chimp who he takes home and treats as a son.This movie is just awesome and its just a happy nice story. That is if you haven't seen the other planet of the apes films if you have the ending is not so happy its really quite scary actually.,8,1,2,7 November 2012
JFK," One of Stones better films.
",This was a very good and interesting movie. The way Oliver Stone took on the true story behind a case brought to court claiming there was a conspiracy to JFKs assasanation. It was very interesting and made some very valid points. I actually have to say that I tonow believe there was more then one shooter on that fateful day. The movie is just too convincing.This movie is about a laywer who believes there is something fishy behind the JFK assassination. He aquires so much evidence to back his case he actually brings it to court saying there was more then one shooter and men had wanted JFK dead.This movie is really good and very interesting if you are into conspiracy theories.,6,2,9,5 November 2012
Django Unchained," Another great film by Tarantino!
",I am always eagerly awaiting Tarantinos new films because he is just such a great director and writer. Everyone one of his movies except for maybe one is a masterpiece and this one is no exception. I would have givin it a higher rating then an eight but towards the end it started to go a little over the top which of course was intentional I just feel it would have turned out perfect if he had just kept it more like the first half.This movie is just great though. The story line is amazing and original and all the actors do a really good job such as Jamie Foxx and Dicaprio. The writing was also just spectacular. I think this movie has some of the best dialogue I have heard in a movie. It feels very real and this movie is actually extremely funny. There was one scene in which I could not stop laughing I was tearing up it was hilarious.If you are a fan of Tarantinos films or just a fan of great movies you will like this no matter what. I don't think it is his greatest film made but it is very close. its made in the typical Tarantino fashion I have met some people that don't like that but I love it as will you.,8,1,5,30 December 2012
Insidious," Are you kidding me people...
","I was on the fence about watching this movie for a long time but after seeing many positive reviews on here I decided to give it a chance...and let me tell you what a mistake that was..People say this movie is scary...It has to be the least scary movie since paranormal activity. The acting is terrible except for patrick Wilson, the story line is lame and the make up effects are laughable. Some moments were supposed to be scary and I found myself laughing.This movie is about a family who moves into a new house but soon begins to think the house is haunted. After moving again from that house they still find strange things happening and they find out its their son thats haunted not the house.This movie was just retarded...like actually one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of bad ones in my day. This whole movie is just laughable. Don't watch this movie unless your like 8 years old then you might be scared.",3,1,2,17 October 2012
2012," Critically hated but very entertaining.
",A lot of people have seemed to hate this movie but if you just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride its actually very enjoyable. It is very intense and epic in every way. John Cusack does a good job as well does the rest of the cast. Some of the parts are in this movie are pretty silly but its still fun.This movie is about a man who starts hearing about how the world is going to end. At first he does not believe it but starts to see signs and then as the beginning of the end of the world starts to happen he struggles to keep him and his family safe.This movie has a really low rating on this website but it is actually pretty entertaining. It is a little bit long though however running about two and a half hours,7,2,2,7 November 2012
Schindler's List," I didn't like it but a lot of people do
","This movie was not good at all in my mind. First avole it was directed by Steven Spielberg who usually directs amazing movies. This however I found it very boring. It was shot in black and white and stars Liam Neesan. I truly hate both of those things.This movie is about the nazi holocaust and concentraction camps. It tell the true story of Oskar Schindler (Neesan) who is a member of the Nazi party, however disagrees about what the Nazis are doing to the jews. He uses his money and his power to save jew lives.I know it sounds good but it really isn't. Liam Neesan cant act in my opinion and black and white loses a lot of the effect which is ironic because they made it black and white for the effect. I just found this movie boring it didn't even have any intense scenes. Skip this one movie goers",Null,0,3,29 August 2011
Kick-Ass," Great action comedy
","When I first saw this movie I was expecting it to be silly and ridiculous and don't get me wrong it was but it was still very good. The plot was a fresh new idea and the writing was good. The actors all did great and were funny(Except for Cage of course hes terrible). Some of the scenes were a little over the top though.This boy is about a young nerd who always gets picked on and mugged and sees all of this happening in his city. As a big fan of comic books he one day decides to dress up as a super hero and fight crime himself. Even though he has no training, weapons, or help that does not stop him from trying to make his city a better place.This movie is pretty good the only reason I didn't put it higher is probably because of the couple over the top scenes. I understand that its supposed to be comedy but comedy can be done through dialouge let the action be crisp and real.",7,1,3,28 October 2012
Gran Torino," Such a great movie!
",I watched this movie when it first came out and I have seen it at least 10 times since then and let me tell you every time it is a delight. Clint Eastwood directs this so you know that its going to be good. He also stars giving a wonderful performance as cranky bigot Walt.This movie is about an old man named Walt (Eastwood) he lives by himself as his wife has recently passed away. He soon notices that his whole neighbor hood is changing. All the white people have moved out and a bunch of asians movie in. Walt is not to fond of other races so this makes him upset. Then one night he saves his next door neighbor from a gang and then they start and unlikely friendship.This movie is really good. Clint Eastwood just does such a fantastic job as a cranky old war veteren. (Walt was in Korea)The only thing I did not like about this movie was the ending. I mean the ending wasn't bad but its not how I would have ended it. That is why no perfect score.9/10,Null,0,2,4 August 2011
Transformers," An Average movie with above average effects
","This is my review on transformers a modern take on an old animated show. It stars Shia Labouef and Megan Fox and was directed Michael Bay.This movie is about a boy named sam (Shia) who is kind of a nerd some what of an outcast. Who has a crush on a girl (Fox) and then one day his dad buys him a car and it turns out to be much more then that.I found this movie to be alright, Shia did a solid acting job but as for Fox everyone knows she cant act and this movie was no exception though she did look good which is why she was there. I found this movie to be a bit long for its plot. I found it dragged out when it could have ended much quicker.Overall I think this movie is worth watching but don't expect too much. 6/10",6,0,1,28 June 2011
Donnie Brasco," Great true mafia story.
",I watched this movie the other night and I really liked it. It was no goodfellas or casino but it was definitely still a great watch. Johnny Depp should stick to movies like this and blow he is such a good actor when given a role like this. This is a true story so it adds to the intensity and starring Depp and Pacino the acting is very good and believable.This movie is about an undercover cop (Depp) who has to infilitrate a mob family particularly to find out more about the mob boss(Pacino) he ends up being undercover for years and eventually starts to bond with these mod members.This movie was really good and it being a true story made it that much more amazing. It was very entertaining and the great performances sucked you right in.,7,0,1,20 October 2012
Evil Dead," Not as good as I had hoped.
",This movie was entertaining enough for the most part but I felt it lacking overall but that may just be because I had heard about this movie about a year ago and I have been waiting ever since then so I was hoping for something really good that could have lowered my opinion of it.The first thing you will here people say is there is tons of gore. Now I don't know If I have became totally desensitized over the years from watching some of the disturbing movies I have watched but for me this movie was not that gory. It had a couple moments with some pretty intense gore but the scenes were very short. I fear that they had to cut many scenes out of it.Overall though despite the hype it was a decent movie. The acting was good for the most part and it did have some creepy moments in it however I think many of the creepy parts were cut out and toned down seeing how many of the parts in the red band trailer were not in the movie.Not as scary or as gory as I had hoped but I have seen every scary and disturbing movie out there so my opinion may not be valid as I don't get scared.,6,8,43,6 April 2013
Saw II," Saw 2 better then the first!
","I saw this movie in thetres when it first came out when I was just a young kid and it scared the hell out of me. I really liked the first one so I decided to see this one in theaters and im glad I did. This one is better then the first with a more involved story line, better actors portraying much more dynamic characters. There was much more action and a lot more suspsense.This movie is about the jigsaw killer who sets up a game for a shady cop to play. How he does in the game depend if people live or die. He is forced to play because one of the kidnapped people is his son.Overall I say this movie was better then the first one. The actors were better and the story line added a lot more plus there was quite a few more action scenes so I really enjoyed it.",7,1,2,20 October 2012
From Dusk Till Dawn," Clooneys best role...buttt the movie is flawed.
","This is hands down clooneys coolest and best role. It is so out of his normal comfort zone for acting and I love it. He has some hilarious moments and great acting.This movie is about two brothers (clooney and Tarantino)who are robbers. They just finished committing a robbery and needed a way out. So they high jack a motor home with the family still inside. The family is scared for their life but clooney has no intention of hurting them,i don't know if i can say the same for his brother on the other hand. They make the family drive to a bar in Mexico where some unlikely events happen.This movie is filled with great actors, clooney ,Tarantino, keitel and more. The first half of the movie is really good its up until the twist comes where it starts to get a little silly. Mainly to the fact the special effects are so bad. In my opinion they should have kept the movie going the same style it was in the first half. Overall if you like Tarantino and clooney you should probably see this movie if not don't risk it.",Null,0,0,23 July 2011
Paranormal Activity," probably the worst movie ever made.
","First let me say if you life this movie you probably have not seen any good movie in your life. This movie is horrible. It is very low budget, the acting is just atrocious and it is not scary at all. I don't know if you remember all the hype for this movie saying 'the scariest movie of all time' but that is probably why it grossed 100 million. Why people like it is beyond me. I love horror movies but i don't like boring movies that are not scary. This movie is about a couple in a house who notices weird things that start to happen. So they set up a camera and then go to sleep. (literally half the movie is them sleeping then a loud noise them being like ahhhh oh my god..... It is so lame. After they watch the film they indeed find out there is something besides them living in that house.Please friends i am a huge horror fan and i could not stand this movie. If you are a big film lover stay away from this. Even if your not. the only reason anyone should ever watch this train wreck of a movie is if every movie on earth is destroyed and you have had a labotomy hands down worst movie ever.",Null,0,0,23 July 2011
A Bug's Life," Great!
",This is one of my favorite animation movies for sure. The animation was just jaw dropping for its time and even holds up now against some movies. The voice actors all did a good job and it manages to hold your attention with a very captivating storyline.This movie is a about a young ant named flick. He is a screw up around the colony and one day after screwing up so bad by dropping the food the ants were supposed to give to the grasshoppers in a offer of peace(Grasshoppers oppress the ants) into a pond. The colony then sends him away to 'go looks for bugs to fight the grasshoppers' But it was really just busy work. He actually finds bugs though and brings them back everyone thinks their warriors but they turn out to be circus bugs.This is one of my favorite animated movies and its just great.

The Dark Knight," Very good sequel
",This is by far the best Batman movie that has ever been made. It is way better then the first one in my opinion. This one is filled with actions and great performances when i found the first boring with fewer good actors.This movie takes place right after the first one. If you remember in the first one at the end police man Gordon handed him the joker card saying there's a new bad guy on the loose. So this movie is all about the joker (Heath Ledger)and his attempt to get control of the city by taking down all the rival gangs and eventually batman himself.This movie is just awesome. It has great special effects and some very good actors. Heath Ledger gives the best performance of his life he makes the movie something special. Very good movie the best comic book movie ever hands down!!,Null,0,1,25 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Good but too rushed.
","I have said it once and I will say it again. You can not successfully make a book into a movie that is that long if you do you wind up with this where the movie leaves so much out of the book thats its almost a complete failure. Though Im sure if you never read the books this would be a fine movie but after reading the books these movies just seem more and more rushed.This movies takes place after their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.This was a decent movie and the acting and special effects are getting so much better but its just so disappointing to see some of my favorite series of book be rushed like this. And I understand its hard to do so each movie would have to be 5 hours to be a decent replecation of the book and that can not be done. Which is why these movies probably shouldn't have been made in the first place.",6,0,1,14 November 2012

For its day the animation was groundbreaking. Nowadays it cant compete for it is still very good. The acting is great and the script is hilarious and heart warming.This movie is about a world where toys are alive and when the humans are not around have lives of their own. The childs main toy, Woody(voiced by Tom Hanks) begins to get jealous of a new toy the child gets for a birthday present.This movie is just great. The acting is hilarious and very good.

Men in Black," Great memories from my chidhood watching this!
",I remember when I was about eight or nine and this movie first came out. I loved it so much as many of the kids my age did. I must have watched it 100 times and to this day I still enjoy it. It is easily the best of the series starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Will Smith is his usual hilarious self and Tommy Lee Jones plays his part pretty well too that being said I am usually not a big fan of his.This movie is about a young cop who while chasing a crook one day stumbles upon a strange secret. He meets a man named K from a special orginization called the Men In black. K recruits the young man as his new partner and he finds out what Men In Black does.This will always be one of my favorites movies. I have loved it since I was a kid and there is no doubt that I will be showing it to my kids one day.,8,6,7,18 April 2013
Taken," Pretty good but nothing new.
",This was a very entertaining thriller but it was very predictable with really nothing new.This is about a mans daughter who goes to Paris with her friend and gets kidnapped by some men. The father who has acquired skills at finding people(which he learned from his past government job which he has recently retired)goes to Paris and hunts down the men.This movie was good but there are a couple things that I don't like in it. The fact that it stars liam neisen is one of the problems. He is not a very good actor exspecially when he fakes that atrocious American accent.It was also very predictable but overall it was definitely worth a watch.,7,0,1,17 September 2012
The Mummy Returns," filled with action but lacks what the first delivered.
","This movie is a fail of a sequel. The first was better in this in so many ways. There was more action in this but less of a story line and in some way they managed to make the special effects worse.This one is much like the first one. Although instead of rick and eve who are married in this one it is a group of arabs looking to unleash imotept from his tomb. So rick and eve once again have to go and try to put the undead mummy back in his grave.This movie is no way as good as the first. Not as good of actors, the script was not as good nor was the plot. It seemed like they were running out of ideas and just kind of slapped it together. If you really liked the first one then i suggest you watch it but if you have not seen the first then you might as well skip this one.",Null,0,0,23 July 2011
Avatar," Frankly disappointing.

So I decided to go back for a second viewing and thats when it all came crashing down. Apparently the first time I was just mesmerized by the special effects to truly notice to bad acting,writing and characters.This movie is about a young crippled man who is sent on an army project to leave his human body and be put into an avatar body. His avatar body is a 8 foot tall alien and soon he makes friends with other 8 foot tall aliens.When I first saw the previews for the movie I thought it was going to be so great. But with Cameron spending all his money on special effects it lacks solid writing and actors. Frankly when I found out this is going to be a saga I was not impressed I will watch the other ones with hopes that they will improve.",6,4,8,7 November 2012
Toy Story 2," very good but cant beat the first.
",Toy story has always been one of my favorite film franchises ever since I was little and I still love them. This one is really good it just not as good as the first. Some people may like it better but in my opinion nothing can beat the conflict between Woody and Buzz in the first one it was just hilarious and a great story.This movie is about a toy collector that steals woody. Buzz and all woodies friend make a vow to get him back and promise to do whatever they can.This movie is always going to be one of my favorites it is great for kids and adults alike. Not as good as the first one but still a very good movie.,7,0,1,26 October 2012
Saw," Great original idea for the horror genre.
",I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and everything except the acting blew me away. The story was very creepy and original and it was one of the first movies to fill itself with toture and gore. The story line is great the special effects are very life like the acting is sub par though.This movie is about two men who wake up in a washroom together chained to the wall. They don't know each other but soon they will figure out they share similarities to each other. Figuring out these similarities will be the only way they escape from their tormentors game.This movie was really good.

Super 8," I wasn't impressed.
",When this movie came out I had no urge to watch it but I was bored surfin netflix so I decided to give it a try and I was not happy.This movie is about a group of young kids who enjoy filming movies with their super 8 camera. While fiming one day they witness a train crash and are told to keep it a secret by one of the survivors of it. Though since it was a military train people in the town are suspicious that something bad may have been in that train and with weird disappearances happening all over town just enforces their beliefs.This movie was not as good as everyone says. The acting was flat out bad. One of the kids was a pretty decent actor but the rest were just terrible. The special effects seemed so 2004 and its a pretty high budget movie. And to top it all off the movie is boring and the premise not intriguing at all.I really don't recommend this to anyone. I would say its perfect for little kids but there is quite a bit of swearing so everyone just stay away.,5,0,1,21 June 2012
Sinister," One of the best horror films I have seen in years.
","So many horror films come out which rely on one of two things, either a ton of gore or a ton of cheap jump scares in order to make them scary. This does have a couple jump scenes but for the most part it creates most of the horror through the atmosphere and the creepy found footage videos. All the actors do a great job and the plot is actually pretty good.This movie is a about a writer who writes about terrible murders that happen. He moves with his family to the city its in so he can do research though this time he moved his family into the house of the victims hes doing research on. As the days go by he starts to notice strange things happening in the house.This movie was a great horror movie and for anyone who is actually a fan of the horror genre will love this without a doubt. People looking for tons of gore or jump scares might want to look somewhere else.",8,2,4,24 December 2012
The Fly," A very creepy excellent remake.
",For everybody that hates remake this is one that is far superior to the 1953 original. Jeff Goldblum does a great job in his starring role. This movie is very creepy and well directed. A great story that freaks me out every time I watch it.This movie is about a scientist who invents a teleporting machine. He uses the teleporting machine without a hitch at first but when a fly accidentally gets trapped in the machine as he teleports through he starts to notice strange changes happening to his body.This movie is a really good classic horror movie. The director did a great job and Goldblum really shined.,8,0,1,26 October 2012

","This movie is not actually the story of Jack the ripper just a sort of retelling using Jack the ripper. It is actually a pretty good thriller.

And the storyline was intriguing filled with twists and turns.This movie is about a young detective who is sent to London to investiage the a string of murders of young woman, mainly prostitutes who are being brutally murdered and cut apart by the man known to everyone as Jack the ripper.This movie was pretty good the only reason I give it a six and not higher is mainly because of the ending.

Reservoir Dogs," very low budget but one of the best movies ever!
",Quentin Tarantino directed this movie and he is such a talented director everything he makes seems to turn into gold and this is no exception.

He goes on a bank robbery with them and gets shot. He struggles to stay alive and keep his secret that he is an undercover cop.This movie was awesome.

Arnold has never been that great of an actor but he did a good job here and the rest of the cast plus the original interesting story line made this movie a very enjoyable watch.This movie is about a man who goes to a place called recall to have a artificial memory implanted. He chooses a memory where he is a secret agent who is sent to go save mars. Then a real life situation makes him actually go to mars....or does he.This movie is really good exspecially for a an 80s movie which was not a great time for movies. The special effects were good and the story line makes you really think.,7,0,1,22 November 2012
Limitless," Exactly what you think butt fun none the less
","This is my review on limitless. This movie is most likely exactly what you think its going to be like. There is not much suspense left after you have seen the trailer.This movie is about an average joe or should i say below average joe. Who is a struggling writer trying to make his way. One day walking down the street he runs into his ex wifes brother. They go to a bar have a beer and the brother gives him this pill. The pill opens up his mind to things he never knew were possible. It made him brilliant, witty, strong, and creative everything that you could want. Though this pill causes some unforeseen problems.This is not bad movie by any means. It was a very fun ride but the story fell a little short in my opinion followed by an ending that made no sense. Lots of people don't like Bradley Cooper but i do and he did not disappoint in this movie. Followed by an obviously outstanding performance but Robert Deniro (kind of surprised he was in this)overall though its definitely worth the watch",Null,0,1,23 July 2011
The Descent," Great unique horror idea.
","This is truly one of my favorite horrors made in recent years. It has a new creative idea, It is well directed and the actors all did a very good job which is rare for horror movies. And it sets up a creepy atmosphere with great writing and cinematography. Also a horror movie that does not rely souly on jump scares.This movie is about a group of young women who go on a cave expedition. What they don't know however is these caves have never been explored and soon after becoming trapped by a rockslide they soon start to be hunted by a strange predatory creature.This is definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years and of all time. It is rare you get a horror movie these days with this good of acting and an actual creepy atmosphere.",7,1,3,26 October 2012
Inside Man," Good movie but Spike Lee shows his colours with bigotry
","This movie had a great story line and some great actors but it had some very racist undertones made famous by director Spike Lee. Every white person in this show was either a bad guy. an idiot, a racist or someone evil while all the black guys were the level headed nice guys. Other then that though this movie is an exciting heist movie.This movie is about a group of bankrobbers who plan on robbing a bank but instead once foiled by police turn it into a hostage negotiation. A negotiator is sent to find out the bank robbers main motive because from what he tell the negotiator he is not telling the truth.This movie is pretty good I just really could not stand the racism of the script and screenplay. Overall though this movie is very enjoyable but could have been much better with a better director.",6,2,5,30 October 2012
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino at his best
","This movie was just great. It was one of Tarantinos earlier movies and one of his best. It has an awesome cast Samuel L. Jackson , Bruce Willis, John Travolta, the list goes on and on. This is a great action with a lot of humor mixed in with it.The lives of two moberster hit men, a boxing champ, a vicious gangsters wife and a pair of restaurant robbers intertwine in four tales of violence and redemtion.This is a really good movie. It is some what old but can definitely hold its own. The acting is really good and the script is phenomenal. The story line is very cool and this movie was a popular thing to spin off for years to come. Very good movie watch this",Null,0,2,25 August 2011
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," not the best Guy Ritchie movie.
",This movie was not all bad but I just don't think it was as good as lets say Snatch or something. The actors all did a really good job and there was some exciting parts but the story line kind of just lost it for me.This movie is about 4 British working class stiffs who pool their money together to play a high stakes card game. However something goes wrong and all the sudden they are in debt half a million pounds and they only have one week to come up with the money.This movie was good it was just nothing special. It was kind of slow at parts and when the action finally did come I was disappointed with it. The later Guy Ritchie movies are definitely better in my opinion.,6,3,6,20 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Pretty close to the book.
",I remember growing up and I loved the Harry Potter books I have read them all. This was a pretty good movie it was pretty close to the book but even with a two and half hour runtime it still leaves out many things and thats why the book is much better. The acting in these older ones is pretty bad too seeing how they were just child no name actors back then.This movie is about a young boy named harry potter. He lives with his abusive aunt and uncle and one day gets a letter from a place called Hogwarts. The note explains he is actually a wizard and he is invited to go to Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizards.This movie was pretty good but it was probably one of the worst of the bunch. The acting and special effects were pretty poor and they left too much stuff out of the book stick to the books people,6,1,2,7 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Most exciting but so much out of books left out.
",This one is by far the most exciting movies of the bunch.The acting is getting so much better as the movies progress which is really nice to see. They put all the main parts of the book in the movie but they left so much stuff out that it seemed like it was just jumping from scene to scene in no time the book was much better.This movie is about Harry Potter who goes back to Hogwarts where a competition is underway. three competitors from schools around the world compete in very dangerous challenges. There is only aloud 3 contestants but of course for some reason Harry Potter just has to sneak his way in there.This is the best one so far and most exciting but they leave more and more out of these movies as they go. The book keep getting longer and the movies stay the same length is very upsetting,6,0,0,7 November 2012
Zombieland," good horror/comedy
","This movie is pretty good but the number 1 horror comedy will always be shaun of the dead. This movie though has some great acting and some very comical moments. It doesn't really have any jokes but everything just kind of happens in a comedic fashion.This movie is very straight forward as far as a story line goes. There is a guy who is trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. On his journey he meets some people and they decide to stick together.This movie is a very enjoyable watch. It does have its laughs though not very laugh out loud. And of course it sticks to its zombie movie style and puts in some gore, i would like to have seen more though. Overall good comedy zombie flick. watch this",Null,0,1,22 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," not bad but book beats it by a million
",I find as I wacth these movies they tend to leave more and more out from the books and that really annoys me. I know they could not afford to make the movie any longer then two and half hour but thats why I think books like this should not be made into movies.This movie is about young Harry Potter who goes back to hogwarts only to discover something called the chamber of secrets has been opened. He figures out that the reason its open is because the heir of slytherin is there. Once again the schools safety is up to harry potter.Not a bad movie but like I said the book is way better so people just stick the books I know thats hard for some of you for some reason.,6,0,0,7 November 2012
The Departed," Another Scorsese masterpiece
","This movie is just excellent. Martin Scorsese always makes the best movies with an amazing cast and this movie is no exception. Every actor does such a bang up job that it makes this movie so real and intense. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was because i was not a big fan of the ending other then that though 'perfection'This movie is about 2 cops who are undercover in the irish mafia. Though as the movie progresses bledshed causes suspisions about the two undercover men and moles are sent out to discover their actual identitiesThis movie is one of Scorseses best easily. Very good story line, script, direction and acting. Everybody in this movie does a very, very good job. If you like crime dramas and Scorsese GOO WATCH THIS NOW. once again it is a perfect movie I just didn't like the ending soooo 9/10",Null,0,0,27 July 2011
Die Hard," Grab some buddies, some beers and enjoy!
","This movie is just awesome. Now im not saying its one of the best movies in the world and it would not hold up agaisnt real good movies like goodfellas, godfather etc...but it is a guy movie classic. A classic action men will always love. The acting is B at best the lines are cheesy but boy do I love it.This movie is about John Mclain(Willis) a NYPD officer who is sent to a building that a group of German terrorists has taken over. It is extra personal for Mclain however because his wife is attending the Christmas party in the building where the place is being held.This movie is just pure guy fun. Grab some beers sit on the couch with the buddies and just enjoy the crazy classic action. Its not realistic at all and some points are over the top but this movie will always be a lot of fun.",8,1,2,16 October 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," disappointment.
",Well this is my review of Transformers Revenger of the fallen. All i have to say is this movie is a huge disappointment. I saw it in thetres waited in a three hour line up just to watch it from the front row. NOT WORTH ITThis movie kind of takes off from the first one it still has Shia and Fox who are dating by this point. Now one thing i hated about these movies was they did not explain much about the transformers in the first one so i assumed they were going to get right into it in this one. Boy was i wrong. This movie is about 40 minutes of explanation and then about a hour and 45 minutes of explosions and fight sequences. This is mostly because of the directing talents of Bay. He tries to replace story line and substance with explosions and noise.So I walked out of the thetre feeling bored and frankly a little motion sick from all the fast moving action that never seemed to end.Frankly i did not enjoy this movie after the first 40 minutes and im sure the 3rd will be the exact same. 4/10,4,1,6,28 June 2011
Wedding Crashers," funny but not too funny
",This is my review on wedding crashers now don't get me wrong this movie definitely has its moments but its not really a laugh out loud comedy. It is more of a romantic smart comedy. Which don't get me wrong smart comedies are good but i always find romantic comedies a bit of a let down.This is about two friends (Vaughn and Wilson) who for the past ten years or so have been going to weddings and 'crashing' them which basically they go there to take advantage of all the pretty ladies. They do quite well until they attend one wedding inpaticular. Wilson sees a girl and instantly falls in love with her. Then the movie goes on from there with him trying to win his love.One thing I didn't like about this movie was this. OK so they go to weddings planning on sleeping with girls but oh wait owen sees a girl he instantly falls in love with (sort of stupid and cliché in my book) also after the first half of the movie the comedy dies its all romance.If you are into romantic comedies this one is definitely for you. If you are like me and prefer a good straight comedy movie go watch the hangover or hangover 2.,Null,0,0,22 July 2011
Man on Fire," A good movie but with some problems.
",This movie started off soo good. I probably would have given it a ten if not for its needless addition of all the god stuff instead of just keeping it realistic. The acting was great and the story had you on the edge of your seat although somewhat predictable.This movie is about an alcoholic ex military man who goes to Mexico to be a body guard for a rich familes little girl. He has never does any body guard work before and is not really a people person but he develops a strong relationship with the young girl. A relationship that is tested while on his watch she is abducted.This movie is really good and at some points heart wrenching but like I said somewhat predictable and the adding of nonsense took away from this movie in my opinion overall though still very good.,7,0,0,20 October 2012
Scream 2," A good sequel.
",This movie was good but I don't think it was as good as the first one. The creepy atmosphere is lost in this one. Though the acting is pretty good and there are some pretty intense moments.This movie follows Sidney Prescott two years after the she escapes the murderous boyfriend in the first one. Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury.This movie was not bad at all. It just was not scary at all compared to the first one. I also found I did not care about the characters as much so when They dies it made no difference.,6,1,1,17 October 2012
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A step up from the second one
",This is the third movie in the Die hard franchise and it is probably my favorite one thus far. With the adding of samuel jackson and jeremy irons the cast was pretty good. Lots of action for another fun movie to watch with some beers and your boys.This movie is about a terrorist who a score to settle with John Mclane as he tries to pull off a huge heist in New York and rob fort knox.This movie was a really fun watch. I mean it does not really have a story line but if you just sit and grab a beer and just have fun and laugh at the action then its an awesome movie. So if you like the first two movies then you will definitely like this one because it is the best hands down.,6,0,0,17 October 2012
The Green Mile," A very good heartwarming movie.
",This is such a good movie filled with fantastic actors who all do a great job. Directed by Frank Darabont so the movie turned out phenomenal. The story line is a bit weird but what do you expect from a Steven king novel. Definitely the second best Steven King book to movie to come out.This movie is about a section in the prison called the green mile. Also known as death row. The group of guards watches over the inmates until its ready to execute them. Then one day one of the inmates they get is not a normal inmate. They notice he has a ceratin power to him.This movie is just great and very heartwarming which is weird considering it was a steven king book and usually he does dark and scary stuff.,8,0,1,16 October 2012
Jaws," 'were going to need a bigger boat'
",This movie is a real classic. The first ever movie with an over-sized animal that has a taste of human flesh. This movie was made back in the seventies but they did a really good job with it. Probably due to the fact that Spielberg directed it.This movie is about a island community where everyone basically spends all their time at the beach and on the ocean sailing. Soon though disappearances start to happen and they figure out there is a hungry creature in the bay.This movie will always be a classic and a great thriller. All the actors did a great job and there is some heart racing moments in it as well,7,2,3,20 October 2012
The Lion King," one of the best children's movies from my child hood
",This movie was such a sweet heartwarming tale. It had its funny moments its action it really is a perfect movie for the kids. And for the adults the acting was great and it had a very good story very predictable but not when I was a kid.This movie is about a young lion cub 'Simba' who is tricked into thinking he was responsible for his fathers death so ridden with guilt he leaves the pride and goes off on his own. He grows up on his own but meets lifelong friends on the way.This was such an adorable tale. Everyone is sure to love this movie exspecially the kids but the adults will find it very sweet and heartwarming as well.,7,13,22,16 October 2012
Inception," disappointment.,,
",When I first heard of this movie I could not wait to see it. I heard nothing but good reviews and it had Leo dicaprio which im am a huge fan. It was directed by christoper nolan the man who brought us the dark knight (another one of my favorites) so I watched this with very high expectations and sadly they were not met.This movie is set in the near future where it is actullay possible to enter someones mind and memories through their dreams. So a dream thief (leonardo)is sent into a persons mind to achieve 'inception'Now everybody is going to hate me for this but I thought this movie was just silly. The way they explained it and the explanations they had for everything were convoluted and silly. Then it had about hour of story and then about a hour and a half of shooting guns. You would think a movie with this complicated of story line would describe the story in depth but no. It piles on the information one thing after another in a ridiculous manner. If you liked the matrix and are usually a fan of this kind of Sci-Fi thing then this movie is most likely for you. If you are like me and prefer a movie to have solid story development and you want it to make total sense please stay away from this. The only reason i gave it 6 was because it was high budget it had leo and also some pretty stunning moments.,1,4,6,27 July 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," They don't make them like this anymore.
","This is I would have to say is my favorite movie. It is the only movie I would deem absolutely perfect.This movie is about a man who goes to jail (robbins) that meets a man named red (freeman. Through hard times these two manage to bond. This is a story of hope and redemtion that no one should miss.I personally wonder why they have not came out with a movie of this caliber in soo long. The 21 centuary is the pits for movies. Everybody could see they made the best movies in the 90s, this one of course, goodfellas, forrest gump, casino,American history x, the list goes on and on.I very much insist that everybody watch this movie. If there is one movie you should see in your life its this one. It will captivate you with every sentence, every scene. Now don't have the wrong idea this is no action packed prison gangbang, This is a drama about two men and their friendship. Though it is very very entertaining.If you haven't seen this movie run to your nearest video store and pick up a copy you could probably buy it on DVD for 10 bucks and it will be the best movie in your collection. My only 10 out of 10 so far Shawshank Redemtion , watch it friends",Null,0,0,12 July 2011
Rango," A good movie
",This is probably one of my favorite Animated movies of recent memory. It stars Johnny Depp who plays his part very well and is quite hilarious as a lizard. The animation is amazing everything looks very sharp and very well done. The story line keeps you very interested unlike many of the animated movie they have have somewhat of a child story line this one does not.This movie is about a lizard who has an owner but while driving his cage falls out of the car and he is stranded in the desert. He finds a small town of creatures like himself and creates a new identity for himself claiming he is a roughneck gun slinger.This movie is very good and has its funny moments.

Scream," Great! Original slasher.
",I remember seeing this movie when I was probably 7 or 8 years old and after watching it I could not sleep for like a week. I know 7 or 8 is a little young to be watching this but it definitely is a scary movie. The acting is pretty good the story is original and there is some nice twists and turns.This movie is about a crazy indivdual who dawns a halloween costume and kills people. First he calls them and makes them play sick games if they fail the game he kills them.This movie was like one of the first slashes like this and I loved it. It had you on the edge of your seat and it was not predictable in any way.,7,1,1,17 October 2012
Prometheus," Visually stunning but lacking solid writing.
",I went to see this movie the other night in 3d of course and I was blown away. Everything you saw looked real enough to touch. As far as the writing goes though I was kind of disappointed. They do not explain much from alien it being a prequel and all and they leave a lot of questions unanswered as if to set up a sequel.This movie is set many years before the first alien movie on a ship called the prometheus. They are on a way to a planent with what they think houses the being that created humans.Overall this movie was really good and its worth a watch for sure. But like I said its lacking in the writing. The visual effects will keep you distracted though.Go see this movie in thetres in 3d i know i will be going again.,8,4,8,11 June 2012
1408," Good movie but no scary like people say.
",I first heard about this movie because I have heard countless amount of times about how this movie is scary and one of the scariest movies ever and I don't see how anybody thought this was even a horror movie. It seems much more like a psychological thriller to me. It is very interesting and thrilling but not in the slightest scary.This movie is about a writer who goes to suposedly haunted places and stays the night so later and he can write a book about his experiences. No where he has went so far as been haunted but he wants to go to a hotel room 1408. It had had over fifty people die in it and is apparently actually haunted. The goes there thinking its just going to be a normal night but things start to get strange.This movie is pretty good the only big complaint I would have about this movie is I don't think john Cusack could pull this role off. Not by a long shot.,7,0,0,11 December 2012
Taken 2," not at all compared to the first.
",I actually liked the first Taken and I was quite excited to see this one after watching I felt greatly disappointed. The first one was very intense and dramatic while this one felt like some cheap action film. And there was just scene after scene that made no sense at all and the script in this one was also terrible.This movie is about a group of men who swear to get revenge for the men kill by Bryan Mills while rescuing his daughter in the first movie. So the men kidnap Bryan and his wife and he struggles to find a way to escape.This movie is not bad if you just turn your brain off during movies. However if you don't then you will know doubt point out the many problems in this movie that so many people have already pointed out before me.,4,0,0,19 December 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Very good horror/thriller
",I remember seeing this movie when I was i don't know probably around 9 and boy let me tell you was i freaked out. Anthony hopkins stars in this and gives a very creepy performance that will have the hairs on your neck stand on end.This movie is about a young FBI agent (Foster) who has to go interview an incarcerated and munipulitive killer (Hopkins) to get his help with another case. A man by the name of Buffalo Bill is going around killing and skinning women and they think this killer can help them find him.This movie is very good. Hopkins gives such a great performance. Foster is not bad but i really don't care for her much. This movie is very creepy though it has not much violence or gore the atmosphere is terrifying. One of the greatest horror movies ever made.,Null,1,3,25 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Good but not as good as the second.
",I really like all the batman movies and this was no exception but personally I think the second one was better with the masterful performance of the joke by the late Heath Ledger. One thing I have against this movie and most Christopher Nolan movies for that matter was it was too long. They could have easily cut out twenty minutes of this movie but I still enjoyed it. Another problem I have is with the scenes completely irrelevant to the story. Yes I know a lot of those scenes are used to humanize the characters which they did but in the end its a Batman movie lets see some Batman stuff if I wanted to see a good drama I would watch one now the Batman trilogy.This movie takes place eight years after the second installment. Bruce Wayne has isolated himself for the past eight years not returning as Batman and rarely being seen by the public eye. However when a terrorist holds the city hostage under threat of a nuclear bomb he dawns the Batman suit once again in order to stop this maniac from blowing up his home town of Gotham.This movie was really good and it left room again at the end for another sequel but like I said it was just a little too long other then that the writing was good and all the actors did a great job. Banes voice was somewhat annoying though I have to say.,7,1,4,16 November 2012
Iron Man," The best superhero movie besides the dark knight!
","There has been a ton of super hero movies coming out lately and i mean a ton. Im not a big fan of superhero movies usually but this one blew me away. I like it the story line is actullay possible and not just some mutation nonsense. The acting is awesome in this the special effects are great and so is the story line. It is just an all over very enjoyable fun ride.This movie is about very educated,technological mastermind Tony Stark (Downy Jr)who is kipnapped while his convoy is ambushed overseas. The terrorists take him to a cave and make him build his world famous Jericho missile. While in captive instead of making the missle he stumbles upon the greatest technological discovery of his career. Using this technology he creates the best weapon of all time and becomes Iron man.This movie is really good. Robert Downy Jr gives the performance of his life, hands down his best movie.

Toy Story 3," the BEST animation movie to date.
","A lot of animation movies have been coming out lately and none of them could even compare to this. I was a big fan of the first toy story growing up so watching this took me back and i really enjoyed it. The animation is just incredible as it should be sporting a wopping 200 million dollar budget. The acting is great and they story line is funny with quite a lot of touching moments as well.This movie follows the main characters from the first one. Buzz Lightyear Woody, the potato heads, slinky and all. Woodys owner is getting older and going off to college so Woody and the toys begin to think he is going to give them away. But in a mix up they accidentally get sent to charity and their lives get turned upside down.This movie is really good for people of all ages.

Signs," Too many problems to be good.
",Uggg what to say about this movie...First off I will say it was a huge let down mainly because it started off so well and then there was problem after problem....plot hole after plot hole that it just made the movie almost unbearable to watch. Yes the acting was good by the main cast starring Mel Gibson And Jouqin Pheonix but the side cast were terrible. This movie had a high budget but it was shot in about 3 small different places? I have no idea where all the money went.This movie is about an ex reverend who owns a farm. One day after his children were screaming in the fields he runs out to discover crop cirlces. Then they turn on the news and see that something very strange is happening as crop cirlces start to pop up all over the world. He tries to keep his family safe and calm as the invaders come.This movie started off really good and it really did have a creepy atmosphere but why too many plot holes ruined it for me.,5,6,10,25 November 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," The best die hard!!
",When i find out they were making a Die Hard for the new age I was kind of uneasy thinking they might just make it some ridiculous action movie. Which this one kind of is but not to the extent of say the transporter sequels. The acting is good and the action scenes are intense backed by a pretty solid plot.This movie is about a bunch of cyber terrorists who take over Americas power grid. Everything iks controlled by them and their goal instead of killing people is to bring down the government.This movie was definitely the best of the Die Hard franchise. It was action packed filled with great CGI and funny John Mclane lines. If you are a Die Hard fan you have to see this. It does not ruin the series it makes it better.,7,0,3,17 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Great ending to a great series.
",Well its official I have read all the books and seen all the movies. Yes I know I am a little late to the punch but frankly after reading the books and seeing the first three movies I kind of gave up on the movies. But Im really glad I decided to give them another chance. Yes they always skip a lot of stuff but I feel this one was done well mostly due to the fact they spilt it into two parts.The Deathly Hallows is by far the best of the movies. It is the most intense with the best acting and a great ending. The only thing I would have to say is while reading these books its hard to pick out the plot holes and the points that don't make sense but in the movie its very easy to point these out and is there ever a lot of them. Granted it is a book about magic so I don't expect it to make the most of sense but a lot of things just don't add up in it.This movie follows Harry Potter as he tries to destroy all the remaining horcruxes. He goes back to Hogwarts to find the last one where Voldemort and a bunch of death eaters follow. A huge battle is fought and Harry learns the truth about why he survived Voldemorts attack in the first place.This movie is really enjoyable and definitely the best one out of the movie series. Overall though the books do hold up as better but this last installment was really close. And it had such a great ending I really enjoyed it.,8,0,1,16 November 2012
Final Destination," good movie with original idea.
",This is one of my favorite horror/thriller movies. The acting is solid and the idea is very original and well thought out. The movie was not really scary it was just a very good entertaining ride.This movie is about a young man on a school field trip. The class gets on the plane and the young man has a vision that the plane is going to explode and everyone is going to die. He fights with everyone on the plane as no one will believe him only to get himself and a small group kicked off. Then to everyones surprise the plane does blow up. After they celebrate being safe from the plane crash they realize they may not be safe after all.This movie was really good. It had a great creative idea and i really liked it. People who like horror or thriller movies should definitely watch this if you haven't yet.,8,1,1,14 October 2012
The Matrix," Uhh I didn't like it..
",OK I seem to be the only person in the world who doesn't like this movie. Maybe its just my opinion but keanu reeves is one of the worst actors in Hollywood. Everyone second he is on screen I feel like taking a bullet to my brain. The story line was all over the place and the action was lame.Lawrence fishbourne did a good job but like I said keeanu is just too bad. He shows no emotion in his words he is like a wooden robot just saying things. I don't know how he continues to get work in movies it absolutely blows my mind. The whole time I spent wishing he would die...He never did....,4,1,12,14 October 2012
Casino," Scorsese you have done it again..
","Is it me or is it impossible for Scorsese to make anything but a great movie. This movie is no exception made by Martin and followed by his usual cast of gangsters Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro.This movie follows Deniros character as he tries to leave his life as a mobster, go to vegas and open a casion to try to go straight.He finds out however that old ties to oraganized crime and old relationships will come back to haunt him. His Character meets a women (Sharon Stone) they fall in love and have a kid. As the movie progresses he finds out his wife was not who he thought she was. With a wife who doesn't care for him (Stone) and a old friend(Pesci) making his new life very difficult he has to find a way to to put his old life behind him and make a good life for his daughter.This is another masterpiece by Scorsese, mind you it may not be as good as goodfellas it is still a very well made movie with a solid script and fantastic performances from all the actors involved. If you like Scorsese, Deniro or mafia movie this is a must see for you.",9,2,4,28 June 2011

","Rarely a movie comes out that is this close to perfection With a bang up cast, lots of action and a great story line this movie comes very close. The director and crew all did such a great job it turned out very believable.This movie follows a bunch of career criminals as they plan a big bank heist. It also follows a detective(Pacino) who is trying to catch these men before they pull it off.This movie was just great from start to finish. Its run time is nearly three hours but it does not feel like it because it is such a well made movie. It goes into much detail but does not scimp out on the action",7,0,1,19 October 2012
50_50," Very good!
",7.5/10 I watched this movie the other night after reading some very positive things about it and Im glad I finally gave it a watch. I have always liked Seth Rogan and Gordon Levitt is quickly moving up into hollywoods A list. This is a great original movie with some great acting and great writing. Its a mixture of comedy and drama and it does exactly that makes you laugh then makes you feel.This movie is about a young man who despite never smoking or doing anything bad has somehow managed to get cancer. They put him on this medication that has a 50/50 chance of working so his odds are pretty good as cancer goes. Then his friend tries to help him during his toughest time.This is a great story of human emotion and friendship. It has its funny moments but also its heart wrenching moments as well. Great movie give it a watch.,7,0,0,22 November 2012
Get Him to the Greek," Jonah Hill, Russel Brand, Hilarious of course!
",This movie stars Russel Brand and Jonah Hill and is written by the same people who made forgetting sarah marshall so Russel plays the same character. This movie is just hilarious. I don't know exactly if its as funny as Forgetting Sarah Marshall but it is still hilarious none the less.It is about a up and coming music agent (hill) who works for a big music company. He is sent to England to pick up famous rock and roller Aldous Snow (Brand) for his comeback show at the Greek. So he has to put up with Aldouses sex and drugs life style and try to get the rocker to the Greek on time.This is a very funny movie as long as you don't mind some drug use and some follow language. It has hilarious actors in it and is a definite must see for any comedy lover.,Null,3,6,27 July 2011
300," A very entertaining movie.
",This movie is almost purely an entertainment piece. It really does not have much of a plot and what it does have its very simple and straight forward. The acting is done well from most of the actors. Some of the side actors were guilty of over acting in a variety of scenes which was upsetting. The visuals were pretty to look at and the battle scenes done well and intense. Its not the most historically accuarate movie but its still good.This movie is about the king of Sparta who is told that the persians are coming to take over Greece. He tries to bring the spartan army to go battle the persians but the council does not let him. So he takes 300 body guards with him to guard a pass that the persians have to cross through. Its a very narrow path between two cliffs so the thousands of thousands of persians really don't have the advantage against the highly trained spartans.This movie was really good but a few points were somewhat disappointing. Like the fact it was not historically accuarte and the side actors who were not so good other then that pretty good movie.,7,1,2,12 November 2012
Fast Five," Best one since the first!
",I cant believe Im actullay saying this but they came out with a Fast and Furious sequel that I actually liked. No they did not improve on the acting but everything else is done much better. The dialouge and plot were much better this time around and the action scenes actually heart racing.This movie follows Dominic Toretto and his crew of street racers who plan a massive heist to buy their freedom while in the sights of a powerful Brazilian drug lord and a dangerous federal agent.This movie was actually a pleasant surprise. After all the other sequels I was really going to give up on this franchise and Im really glad I didn't and decided to watch this one.,6,0,1,21 October 2012
Pineapple Express," Good movie.
",I was actually really excited to see this movie when it first came out being a big fan of Seth Rogen and James Franco and personally I thought it was going to be funnier. Don't get me wrong it was funny but not humor a lot of people might think funny. I thought it was hilarious but there is not that many moments it becomes more of an action film.This movie is about a process server named Dale(Rogen)who one day while smoking a joint witnesses a murder. He drives quickly to his pot dealers house to hide out. They leave and go into hiding together trying to avoid the hit men who are after them all the while getting into stoned mishaps.This movie was good I just wish they had put more jokes in it. Though the jokes they did have were solid and the dialouge was really good.,6,1,3,7 November 2012
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Great original vampire movie
",This movie is really a great horror drama. The director did a great job and it has a wonderful cast who all perform their roles to near perfection. Although about vampires I would have to say this is more of a drama with a lot of elements of romance in there as well. This movie really does have something for everyone and it definitely suck you into the story.This movie is about a vampire who wants to tell a journalist his life story. The journalist does not believe him at first but he begins to get more and more intrigued as the story goes on.This is one of the best vampire films ever made and despite the fact its not scary it still is very well done and very interesting. The great cast really makes the whole thing come together.,7,1,1,26 October 2012
Jackie Brown," solid movie but very slow.
",I had not seen this movie in a while and I decided to watch it again last night. It was a good movie with great performances and great directing as always by Tarantino but the movie was really slow to a point of almost being boring.This movie is about a stewerdess who gets caught smuggling money and drugs for her gun running boss. She agrees to do a sting on the gun smuggler so she wont do any time in prison.This movie was good but it just did not do it for me like most movies Tarantino makes. It was just too slow with very little action or even drama.,6,3,4,20 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," mixed feelings about this one.
",This movie was really strange. I have never really heard anything about it then after seeing mixed reviews on here I decided to give it a viewing and see what I thought of it. I cant even decide how I feel about it really. At first the movie started off good and I was intrigued by the original idea. Though as he movie progressed it kept getting more and more ridiculous and convoluted.I cant really explain what this movie is about without giving away spoilers. This movie is very confusing but not terrible. The first half was an enjoyable mix of horror/comedy but the second half was just garbage. I suggest you stay away from this one despite all the good reviews on this site.I am a true horror fan and I did not like it though it was not the worst movie I've seen.,5,1,2,14 October 2012
Braveheart," Mel Gibson is just sooo good!!
","A perfect movie does not come out often but this my friends is very close to the perfect movie. I know a lot of that is opinion but a lot is fact right infront of you. The acting is just superb, the storyline heartwarming and has you on the end of your seat, the cinematography is beautiful and so is the soundtrack.This movie is about William Wallace (Mel Gibson) who is Scottish and is constantly harassed by the English. One day he falls in love and gets married but then the English come and start trouble which results in his new wife being killed. He swears vengeance and starts killing English by the hundreds with his fellow countrymen.This movie was just outstanding. The direction was just great from Mel Gibson who is so talented also as the lead in this which he does a very good job. The action is so intense it feels very real and puts you right in the combat. I have seen this movie 50 times and I know Ill watch it many many more.",9,2,4,16 October 2012
Slumdog Millionaire," Great movie but gets a little too romancy.
",I only give this movie a seven because near the end it gets really sappy and kind of lame up until then though the movie was really good and actually quite intense. It shows you life in India but its done from a western film style. The actors all did a good job and of course Danny Boyle did some great directing with some stunning cinematography.This movie is about a young man named Jamal that is on the Indian version of who wants to be a millionaire. He is an uneducated slumdog but somehow is answering all the questions right. They clearly suspect him of cheating but he explains through certain life experiences he was able to obtain the answers.I really enjoyed this movie and the ending was not bad it just got a little sappy for my taste I bet a lot of women really liked that scene but was not for me.,7,0,2,28 October 2012
Gladiator," Very good story and action!
",This movie is just great filled with a powerful storyline and great action scenes. The cast does a very good job everyone except russel crowe I don't really care for him much but everyone else did a fantastic job. The action scenes were very intense and had your heart racing.This movie is about a general (Crowe) who is loved by everyone including the emporer. The emporer does not love his own son however and asks maximus(Crowe) to take over as emporer once he dies. The emporers son finds out though and frames him for his death. They send the general for exectution where he escapes and is rounded up by slave drivers who turn him into a gladiator.This movie is very good. Its a must see for everyone. A lot of people think it is too slow and too long but that is nonsense it is just perfect go watch it.,8,0,0,16 October 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Pleasantly surprised....not saying much...
","This is my review on the third installment to the Transformers series. Let me first say after i watched the second one I really was not going to waste my time with this one. Though it was in 3d so i decided to check it out.This movie is a lot like the second one. About an hour of story line(if you could call that a story) then about and hour and a half of explosions and CGI.Now if you watch movies and take them in at face value and all your looking for is explosions and CGI then by all means this may be your favorite film. As for any true film lovers like myself though if you enjoy story line, solid acting, good script and direction then this movie is probably not for you.This is dirceted by Michael bay which of course means he is going to pump exsplosions and CGI whenever he can. And hell why not he makes hundreds of millions off these movies.Overall though if you are looking for a good movie you can skip this one. If you are bored and like just watching explosions and and incredible CGI then go ahead. Better then the second one not as good as the first. 5/10",Null,4,10,12 July 2011
The Social Network," great movie!
",This movie is brought to by the same man who brought us fight club so could you expect anything less then a great movie. This is a true story so it makes it all the more exciting with a great script and captivating characters.This is the true story of the invention of facebook. Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) invents facebook then is sued by a couple people that say he stole their idea. It has a very simple story line that most people probably already know because of its relevance in society. This movie is great. It has good scenes great acting and very good directing. It has funny moments and drama as well. If you like a good drama based on a true story this is for you. If you have something against facebook or social networking this probably is not for you.,Null,0,4,27 July 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," Great movie!
",This movie was just great. It had a wonderful touching story line filled with very dramatic heart wrenching moments. The acting was terrific stared by Will Smith I never knew Smith could act like this but he is just great. Followed by his supporting actor which is his son who actually plays his son in the movie. He is very good for such a young child actor.This movie is about a man who takes custody of his son as he tries to get a new job that will set him and son up for the rest of their lives. Hes a very smart man but struggles to make ends meet and provide for his son while trying so desperately to get this good job.This movie is really interesting from start to finish. Some people say this movie is boring? If you think this movie is boring there is something wrong with you. If you like a great heart wrenching drama then this is great for you.,8,0,0,22 November 2012
Goodfellas," Possibly my favorite?
","Alright this is going to be a long review because i have so much to say about this film. First off this one of the or the best mafia film ever made. It stars a bang up cast of world class actors, ray liotta, joe pesci, robert deniro, paul sorvino and the list goes on and on. It was written and dircted by Martin Scorscese who is considered by many to be the best film maker of all time.This movie follows the true story of Henry Hill (Liotta) a young man who started working for the mob when he was just a teenager. The movie gives a very detailed view of his life and all the trouble he faced through out it.This is easily Ray Liottas finest hour and this movie is the reason he even got into Hollywood. Also it has a bang up performances from Robert deniro and joe pesci. Mob movies would not be the same without those two in them. This movie all comes together perfectly made possible by the fantastic writing of Scorsese and the immaculate acting of all those involved. I highly recommend this to everyone hands down the best mafia film ever made",10,1,2,28 June 2011
Princess Mononoke," One of the best anime films to come to America
","This is truly one of the best anime movies to come over to America and I have seen my fair share of them. It is a very intense storyline. It is odd obviously seeing how it is anime and if you seen anime you know the story lines are strange but this one is not so crazy.On a journey to find the cure for a Tatarigami's curse, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods and Tatara, a mining colony. In this quest he also meets San, the Mononoke Hime He soon sees hes stuck between sides.This movie is really good. Like I said it is a bit strange so a lot of people will be turned off because of it but if you like anime and then you will know what to expect and you will love this movie for sure.",7,1,3,16 October 2012
The Fighter," Fantastic!
","I watched this movie the other night for the first time. I have no idea why I waited so long to see it and i definitely regret not watching it in theaters. I enjoyed this movie a lot. The acting was incredible Christian Bale blew me away in this movie. Im usually not the biggest fan of his but he was hilarious and very believable. This is a true story about two brothers. The older brother trains his younger brother whos aspiring to be a boxer. The brothers get into a quarrel and they end up not training together anymore. Micky (Wahlberg)soon discovers that his was his brother that was holding him back under his new team of trainers he is an elite fighter. The movie progresses and shows problems mickey has with his family and his career.One thing i disliked about this movie was how it did not focus on boxing as much as I would have liked it to. Don't get me wrong I am in no way a boxing fan but i thought a movie that is based on a true story of a boxer should have a bit more boxing development in it. Though it is mainly about him and his familys drama. This is the reason for no perfect score.This movie is very well done however with amazing performances from the cast, a very powerful script and solid directing I was very impressed. Also it is based on a true story which everybody knows makes any movie better. Go watch this movie now friends",Null,0,0,22 July 2011
