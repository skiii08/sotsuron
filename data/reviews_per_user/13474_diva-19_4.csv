The Blair Witch Project," BOO
","I f you have been living in the woods ( and lived to tell about it) or been on the moon, you just may have missed the advance and reviews about this little film. Its a very well crafted and created student film with a brilliant premise. Congrats to all involved; screenplay, direction, cinematography and performances are all very fine. Curiously, the problem here is with the press. Trumpeted as the scariest film in years, eerie beyond mention, the articles etc have raised expectations to a fever pitch. Few films can live up  to this and neither does 'Blair Witch'. Its simply not the terrifying movie that one is anticipating when one sits in the darkened theater.Its a shame, because there is very good stuff here; not genius, but good. So if you have read or heard anything about the picture; you will hopefully love it.",6,0,2,25 July 1999
The 13th Warrior," WHEN MEN WERE MEN
","Another film in the style of 'Bravehart' and all.The story is some confused tale of an Arab hooked up with Norsemen to protect some tribe that is being seriously put upon by guys with Grizzly Bear headresses.Valhalla is mentioned a couple of times in the script giving the film mythological barings (no pun intended);however,Richard Wagner did it better; as did George Lucas with the original 'Star Wars'.The script is hopeless and the performances are adequate for the drama on hand.The first hour is tedious; the second hour moves well. Banderas, in the lead,does a fine job of looking concerned.He should be considering his recent track record of films.Is this actor deliberately trying to kill a career or what? He has made some good pics, but not for some time.This go around, his character is a void in the middle of the film with no motivating force whatsoever. 'The Thirteenth Warrior' is not a complete waste of time, though. Cinematography, sets,fur costumes (not an animal rights film - plus horses take quite a beating in the battle scenes) and special effects are all very good.The battle scenes are fun with beheadings and blood spurting all over everyone and not really disturbing, because this movie never becomes at all personal and never gets one emotionally involved. It's distant and theatrical; kind of like a video game.The scenery is great with lots of mist. Check out the great line of fire (torches) as the bear warriors on horseback ride out of the valley to do battle. If this genre of film appeals to you; it's worth the ticket price; if not,steer clear, as 'The Thirteenth Warrior' will not convert you.",4,0,0,11 September 1999
Brokeback Mountain," Of Lovers And Longings
","An excellent film about love. Every character is spot on. Excellent acting, though both leads are award winning. Both should hopefully receive nominations. Despite the film taking place in 1963 - 1983, it is also sorrowfully current. It is an important film for its subtle power. Though not preachy, it will have an important place in film history. The first part of the film is beautiful in its rustic beauty. Terrific cinematography. Mountains, rushing rivers, herds of sheep - innocence?Here it is on the mountain's slopes that the love of these mens' lives starts. There will never be anyone else. It is simple here, uncomplicated - a part of nature and natural. The physical is more violent than erotic or perhaps that is the eroticism. The sex scenes are hardly ground breaking and should not upset many. Not graphic unlike some reports. When these lovers do descend from the mountain and away from nature, is when their troubles and frustrations start. Absolutely no one fares well in this film. By the end most of the lives portrayed have been shattered. It is all extremely sad and honestly depressing on so many levels, but it is superb and a must see. A pretty safe bet as a very serious contender for 'Best Picture' in all of the awards still to come. Commendations to Ang Lee for his languorous, perfectly paced direction and for making this film at all. It too must have been a test of endurance, which will ultimately benefit all.",10,13,16,17 December 2005
North by Northwest," TOP HITCH
",To put it as simply as possible. Film does not get any better than this. One of the Master's finest pictures. From the marvelous opening credits with that great Herrmann score to the wonderful closing lines there is never a dull moment. The most important art form of the last century at its very best.,10,0,1,11 June 2002
