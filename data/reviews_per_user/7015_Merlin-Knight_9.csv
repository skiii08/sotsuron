Iron Man 3," my 2 cents
","There was a quote I heard in a show or movie or something once.. 'your only as good as your last show..' With that in mind I must say I am seriously disappointed with Ironman 3 .. it was no where near as good as the first 2 were. I honestly feel that any money that this movie makes will be because of the movies before it.. and not because of its own merits.. I paid to see the first 2 Ironman movies in theatre 3 times.. and I did the same with Thor and Avengers, but this one was what can only be described as an epic failure. I actually kinda regret paying to see it in theatre.. I should have just waited for pay per view or something.. It was no where in the same realm or class of the other movies I named here.. the story line was weak, the characters had no passion or chemistry.. tony stark seemed like an empty shell.. we have seen that character face his mortality several times yet never once did it shake him. And where was shield when all this was going on.. the whole thing just made no sense.. all of this I might have been willing to accept if they had at least gotten The Mandarin right but they dropped the ball on that too.. in the comics The Mandarin is portrayed as a genius scientist and a skilled martial artist. However, his primary sources of power are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and is worn on a specific finger. Not one part of this was portrayed in the movie.. instead they made The Mandarin just another genetically enhanced moron with delusions of grandeur, all in all this is the is definitely one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It was just a disappointing all the way around.",1,4,11,11 May 2013
Captain Marvel," My Two Cents
","I have to be honest I saw a great many ratings of 1 or 2 and I find myself confused at how people rated it so low. I found the movie to be quite entertaining myself. It was almost as good as the first iron man movie and there are some parallels that can be seen between the characters in regards to their attitudes.
I can't help but feel I watched a totally different movie then the other did.The special effects were quite decent as they always are for a Marvel movie.. People say she was way over powered but the truth is it wasn't the very end where her powers were really even shown... I mean she did an energy blast and had enhanced strength ..that fairly minor we saw more power from all the other characters then we did from we did from her at first... I mean we didn't even see her full true power until the end of the movie... Thor was just Boom from the very start so was Iron man. Most of the avengers origin movies demonstrated more power at the beginning of the movie then she had.. Anyways I find most of their objections rather absurd. I mean is the character powerful yes.. but really i have seen just as much power out of other characters in the marvel universe.I found Brie Larson's portrayal of Captain Marvel to be rather decent to be honest..I think all in all there was a lot of growth in the character... I found the development of it quite well done.Now there are those that claimed it was full of plot holes and such forth but if you really look at the other movies marvel has made there was a lot of those in all their movies.Anyways I Hope this helped some people to make their own decisions..and that's My 2 Cents",8,7,13,29 April 2019
Pacific Rim," My 2 Cents
",I found this movie to be well worth the money it cost me to see it.. I found that there was a very good balance between all the elements of the show I found all aspects of this movie to be fairly well done to be honest. The special effects were first rate and ever present but they didn't over power the rest of the elements of the show. Such as the acting or the story line. Quite the contrary I found the that acting was also well done I felt there was a lot of chemistry between the actors. As for the story line I think the greatest compliment one can say about a story line to a movie or a plot to a book.. is that the story pulled you in .. you felt a part of it. I think that applies to this film. I mean yes it was semi predictable for the end but well it just wouldn't be the same without that ending.,8,0,1,24 December 2015
Ant-Man," My 2 Cents
",First off I have to say I am rather critical about most superhero movies I know a great many of the original story lines and all to often I find that a lot of writers take a little to much artistic licensing with somethings and as a result they change the back story or even the original story line to much. Sadly I do feel they did that with this movie as well however I am happy to say that for the most part I think the spirit behind the original story line was kept. That being said I have to say that I thought the acting was well done the characters seemed to have real chemistry between them.. The Special effects though were seen through most of the movie were not so over powering that they would take away from the acting or the story line itself. As a stand alone movie if I had never heard of Ant-Man before I would say it would be a 9 but because I have knowledge of the original story line of the hero I have to say 8. All in all a very good movie I totally recommend seeing it.,8,2,5,24 December 2015
Avengers: Endgame," My Two Cents
","I have to be honest I found that this movie left me wanting is so many ways. I both liked and disliked the way the hulk progressed in it.. I mean he went from angry savage to bulked up scientist .. as a result he had very lil to contribute to the movies other then comic relief. Thor was no different.. they turned the once noble and proud warrior into a fat simpering slob. Who also was lil more then comic relief.. if that The fact is that the whole movie really could have been done with out those two characters involved really. and almost was. Their roles were both so down played as a result that I am not sure the movie goers would have missed their presence in the movie. As far as Captain America and Iron man goes I found their actions predictable. The Captain Never liked being in the future... and Tony was always looking to prove to the world that he was a true hero.. and would pay the ultimate price. I was sad to see the character die but I did see it coming.
As far as Hawkeye and Black Widow go well I would like to have seen it go the other way to be honest as I rather liked the Black Widow character.
I enjoyed the growth of the characters of both nebula and gamora..
As for all the others a great many weren't even in the movie until the last 10 or so Minutes.As for the story line.. I well I found it lacking in a major way not to mention their premise behind their use of the gems... they didn't want to lose anything gained over the years.. but at the same time bring back all those lost due to Thanos. It quite literally made zero no sense I mean its kind of impossible. Its a major paradox and the truth is Tony Stark would have know that and as a result I cant see how he or anyone else in the team that would have known that would have or could have gone along with any of it. As such a thing would have been potentially more dangerous to reality then Thanos ever was or could be.",2,30,49,29 April 2019
Clash of the Titans," My 2 Cents
",I am truly torn on what to rate this movie.. as a stand alone movie it was about a 5 maybe a 3 at best... however if you went to see or buy this movie with the original one in mine I would have to give it a 1 ... because the two movies had absolutely nothing in common other then the title in my eyes.. They totally rewrote the story to the point that other then some of the characters names it had zero in common. To be honest I also think they it was not written as well as the original. it is mostly the special effects that carried it the acting was not terrible but it wasn't good either. I believe all in all I can sum it up with a simple sentence if you are going to do a rewrite at least improve upon the original.,5,0,0,2 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," My 2 Cents
",I wanted this movie to be better then it was there were many things that so many others have already said were wrong. I think the truth is that the some where along the line someone messed up as the characters seemed to have lost some of the chemistry .. I cant put the blame on the cast though as they are all top notch actors and actress's after all they were all in the first one and it turned out amazingly so they can clearly work together well. The truth is though that as crucial is in a movie a good cast can only take a movie so far. I cant complain about the special effects as like with the first one I found most of the special effects to be well done. I think what pulls this movie down was poor writing to be honest. I mean the characters seemed some how weaker. As to Ulron I think it was a good start for the character. I am hoping that should they do a following movie that all those involved will be on their A game so to speak as this time I kinda feel that this was well more of a near miss they had good intent.. and some good ideas I just am not so sure they did it justice.,4,10,22,30 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," My Two Cents
","Its hard to critic this movie without mentioning the others.. It really is I will say that the last though were alright felt like they had a different spirit or feel to them the the original ones did. I am happy to say I felt this one heralded back to the spirit of the Original Star wars series. I don't mean that in a bad way I just felt that the Original Star wars 4,5,6 just had a different flow to them I think 1,2,3 were good but they pandered a little to much to kids. Ie Jar jar. I think 2 and 3 might have been better if they had done like a part part 2 in there some where as I felt that they were trying to fit to much in such a short time. Anyways Back to this one.. As I said I felt that in the end it went back to the feel of The Original and I am quite happy with it.",7,2,16,25 March 2016
Deadpool," MY Two Cents
",I will admit that I had trepidation's about seeing this movie I was concerned that they wouldn't do the Character of Deadpool Justice. I am happy to say I had no reason for concern. I can honestly say that I was totally impressed with this movie. I found that they kept to the spirit of the comic character extremely well. I thought the writing was exceptionally well done. I like the way the story unfolded. The Special effects were there but they weren't over the top. Lastly I have to say that in the end I think it was one of my favorite movies to watch this year thus far. It had action it had laughs and a bit of a twisted moral in its own way. I know some people were upset with it but I have to be honest I think those are the people that had never picked up a Deadpool comic or even bothered to actually watch the previews. Which to me is the fault of the viewer not the movie.. I mean if your going to go spend money on a show do some research. That goes for those parents that took their kids to the movie.,9,11,26,25 March 2016
