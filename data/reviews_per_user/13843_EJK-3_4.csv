The Blair Witch Project," another try
","well i hated this movie the first time. so one year lated i rented it again to see 'what was i missing???'well i am missing a brain for thinking that it might improve with age or a second time aroundit doesn't ==== as a matter of fact it gets worse.i don't get the big deal -=------ it is NOT scary, NOT entertaining, does NOT hold your interest, it does NOT have good characters, it does NOT make you think.  it isn't even mindless fun.it is just stupid and annoying and a complete waste of time.  i guess one can never underestimate the taste of the public at large.  this movie deserved to make $0.i still think the entire budget of the movie went to beer and pizza.  and twigs and rocks.made me save money by NOT going to see Blair Witch 2.",1,93,164,11 December 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Incredibly over-rated and NOT scary
","this movie has received more hype than it deserves.  while the premise is incredibly original and clever, the actual execution and story are weak, and there are some glaring holes in the story line.#1 -- even though it is 1994 --- who would go into the woods in the middle of nowhere WITHOUT A CELL PHONE, or at least not driving the car.  and why would you film this if you were being chased by a witch.  even though you have to buy into the fantasy of it all, i just couldnt due to so many holes.it was not scary and the hand held camera is sure to give the weak of stomach major problems  (it did for me)to much hype",1,0,2,11 August 1999
Duck Soup," Nothing tops this for sheer delight
","by far the best of the Marx Brothers (tho some may argue for A Night At the Opera)... this movie, over 65 years old, holds up better than any comedy produced in this decade.  The last of the movies with Zeppo, this is sheer lunacy, timing, sight gags, one-liners and Margaret Dumont at their very best.Dumont was always under-rated and over-looked at in this film she shines as the straight man.This is one you can watch over and over again and still laugh out loud.Along with 'Some Like It Hot' --- probably the two funniest movies ever",10,0,0,18 November 1999
The Producers," the 15 funniest minutes ever
","this is a gem of a movie.  with an incredible amount of quotable lines, a plot of pure zaniness and satire, terrific performances from Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder and the very under-rated Dick Shawn.but nothing compares to 'Springtime for Hitler'the play sequence --- the opening Busby Berkeley number (Springtime for Hitler and Germany, curtains for Poland and France, c'mon Germans go into your dance) and Dick Shawn as Hitler is probably the funniest 15 minutes EVER filmed!you can't watch this movie enough times",9,1,1,18 November 1999
