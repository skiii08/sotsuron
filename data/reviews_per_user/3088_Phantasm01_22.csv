The Blair Witch Project," Must be seen with your mind's eye
","To all of those folks out there that walked out of the theater wanting their money back because they didn't see a witch or blood or people being torn limb from limb, WAKE UP! In order for this movie to terrify you, you have to have an alert and productive mind. Remember Psycho? Did you actually see the lady in shower get stabbed? Did you see buckets of blood? Of course not but it scared you just the same.The Blair Witch Project used the same tactics. Three people wander off to get film on a legend that they've heard. The town of Burketsville had an unusually high death rate of young children for a time. After interviwing some of the locals, the film crew decides to venture into the woods to find the shack that the so-called Blair Witch was using. The crew gets lost and has to spend the night in the woods where something appears to be following them. Trying to descibe this film any further than that just wouldn't be helpful to you at this time. It is a story that reveals itself in the visual, not just auditorially.What could be scarier than being lost in the woods at night? The scariest things you can imagine are in your own mind. That's why kids are afraid of the dark. Their minds are young, fertile and active. They don't even know what they're afraid of, they just are. This film uses that same principle.Our minds have become lazy from having everything being presented to it on a silver platter. No time to think, just keep feeding it images so it doesn't have to do any work on it's own! I don't think I've ever seen a more frightening movie and I've seen them all. I love horror and I'm always fascinated by the many different ways that Hollywood comes up with to scare us. Granted at this point, most horror these days is just is some madman running around slashing teenagers or weirdo cults worshipping Satan. No imagination. Get with it gang.The scariest things are the things you can't see!",10,1,3,9 August 2006
The Ring," Sorry but it sucks
","This film is a waste of time.That said, the first ten minutes are extraordinary. Nicely shot, creepy, beautifully paced, and well acted. The only other ray of hope for this film was the first time we see one of Samara's victims (the blonde in the closet! Holy crap! I sure didn't see THAT coming in the theater!), but other than that this film tries and fails to repeat the aura of the first ten minutes for an couple of hours. Most of it is just too ridiculous. The horse scene, the electrocution scene, the final TV scene - nothing works. It's just not good. The horse/ferry scene is uneccessary, really just a lame attempt to be disturbing. The electrocution scene is too drawn out and implausible (this is a movie about ghosts coming out of TVs - for a shot to not work in it because it's too fantastic is really something!).This film almost works, or would have, if it ended after our heroine solved the mystery of the tape. 'Wow,' I said to myself in the theater as Naomi Watts and her beau walked off into the night, 'They really tried some interesting stuff in that movie. Not all of it worked, but at least they tried.' Then the film kept going. 'Wait,' I asked myself, 'Why aren't they rolling credits?' Then it dawned on me that the movie was about to nosedive. I distinctly remember saying 'No good can come of this.' aloud, referring to the decision to not end the film. Obviously, I was horrendously disappointed. After seeing Creepy Little Hospitalized Girl Samara, Soggy Vicious Undead Samara was silly. The whole set-piece where Noah dies is totally predictable (right down to him tripping over something), Samara isn't scary, and removing frames of film to make movement jerky isn't frightening - it's headache inducing. God-awful ending to a god-awful movie.",2,0,6,10 May 2006
Hostel," 1.5 STARS: 'New Age' horror (if you can call it that)...a tale of torture, pain and suffering may be more accurate.
","must admit that these 'New Age' horror movies like 'Hostel', 'Cabin Fever' and the 'Saw' movies really make me laugh. If Stanley Kubrick were alive, he would laugh too. These movies are not difficult to create, nor do they exhibit any real talent on the part of the director and certainly not the actors. Nevertheless, I found 'Hostel' somewhat entertaining in more of a dark comedy kind of way than a horror flick. Let's face the fact that there is nothing scary or horrifying about this movie. It's gruesome and makes you want to recount your fingers and toes to make sure they are all there, but it's not a horror movie in the classic or traditional sense of the genre. The fear, scary if you will, and atmospheric elements are completely lacking.What 'Hostel' stands for is the new age of horror movies (if you can even call it that) that focuses more on torture, pain, suffering and gore more than anything else and is largely unimaginative invoking no sense of fear in the audience but a sense of dread more than anything else. 'Hostel' is indicative of the fact that the horror genre is undergoing a kind of metamorphasis probably because of a lack of creativity and imagination on the part of the creators of such flicks. For the life of me, I don't see how anyone can call the 'Saw' films, 'Cabin Fever' or 'Hostel' scary in the true sense of the word.'Hostel' is primarily about a group of sex-crazed young men who decide to go to Amsterdam to pick up girls, (mostly prostitutes) and have a good time. Well, they end up at a place where inflicting suffering and pain is sold to those who would pay to indulge themselves. The problem is that our sex-crazed young men are some of the most prized torture-objects of these sadistic individuals' insatiable desire. What proceeds is simply 'a tale of torture, pain and suffering' which is basically what 'Hostel' is all about. If this appeals to you, 'Hostel' is right up your alley...if you are looking for a scary movie or traditional horror movie, you need to stay clear of 'Hostel'. As I said, I found 'Hostel' entertaining from a dark comedy standpoint and that's all. However, I think it's significant to the viewer that not only is the acting extremely poor in this movie, it is also worth noting that there really aren't any characters in this movie (of any significance) worth sympathizing with except for maybe the oriental girl, but she's not a main character.I do not want to give 'Hostel' any moral credit as that would insult the creators of this fine flick, but one could look at 'Hostel' from a variety of different ways. Perhaps we should look at the irony in 'Hostel' in that when you are on the hunt for something, you could also be the hunted as well, especially in lands that we know little about and where we are also not protected by the laws, liberties and rights that we have in the United States. A great example of a movie where this is true is 'The Midnight Express' starring Brad Davis. While the parallels may be weak between the two, I think the reader can see where I'm coming from in this regard. All in all, I mildly enjoyed 'Hostel' but not for the reasons that most people liked it. Truth be told, this movie does not deserve two (2) stars as a horror movie, but for its entertainment value, I'll give it 1.5 stars. After having seen Eli Roth's 'Hostel' and 'Cabin Fever', I think it's safe to say that Mr. Roth would not know a horror movie from a cheerio.",2,1,4,27 January 2007
Brokeback Mountain," A Masterpiece of Modern Cinema
","Spectacular! There are no words to describe just how moving and honest and real this film is. The bottom line here is a message that transcends all barriers; gay or straight, male or female, rich or poor. The message is that love comes in many forms and if you are ever lucky enough to find a love so deep and strong, you must hang onto it regardless of all other outside factors. And when you don't, you very well could end up with nothing just as Ennis DelMar does. This is not a gay cowboy movie. It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.I've read a lot of the other reviews and it seems that everyone has a different take on Jack and Ennis's relationship. But this is how I see it: Yes, they were both gay and they were both in love, not in lust, with each other. Lust doesn't last 20 years and the fact that they did go on to have so-called 'normal' relationships with the women they married was not because they were bisexual but because they were doing what they thought they 'had' to do. They tried hard to deny who they really were inside and married women, had families, then girlfriends but this was all part of the social pressure they felt to be 'normal'. Jack had more guts than Ennis did and was desperate to have a life with him because he needed him and loved him so badly, but Ennis was too uncomfortable with his love for Jack, was too embarrassed by it and couldn't have followed his heart because he was too consumed with the murder of the gay man he'd witnessed as a child. It isn't until the end, when Jack is gone, that Ennis comes to the realization that he let the love of his life slip through his hands. His daughter has found love and is getting married, Alma has remarried and Ennis finds himself alone with nothing to love or hang onto because he let his fears and insecurities about who he was come before his true love for Jack. The lesson is a hard one but the message is simple: No matter who you are or who you love, don't let anyone tell you who you should be. If you have love to give, give it freely and to whomever you wish. Never, never, never deny your heart.",10,22,25,1 July 2006
Spider-Man 3," It's fast, fun, and full of action but that's about it....
","At 2 hours and 20 minutes Spider-Man 3 is a bit long but even at this length, there isn't enough time to fully realize all the stories. The film is a bit bloated and it feels like 3 different films lumped into one. Some of the story elements work well while others fall absolutely flat. The one glaring mistake is how the character of Eddie Brock/Venom is handled. This is a villain worthy of his own film. For fans of the comic book, Venom is probably one of the greatest Spidey villains in the comic book's history. His popularity resulted in his own comic book and when the films began to come out, many fans longed for the addition of Venom. I'm going to assume most hardcore fans, and perhaps the casual moviegoer are going to be disappointed with how the character is represented. The main issue is a lack of screen time. Eddie Brock isn't given any time to form into a real character so when he is transformed, you feel very little sympathy. When he finally becomes Venom, he is rendered with wonderful special effects, but he isn't given enough to do. I won't even speak of his demise which is anti-climatic at best. This is a major misfire and the fact that such a major villain was lumped into a film that was already overloaded, is a shame.The best story involves the one that has been establishing since the first film. The conflict between Peter/Harry/Mary Jane is actually handled very well and I think it works more than the other stories because we're actually connected to all of the primary players involved. They've spent three films developing the characters and we've grown to care about each of them. The biggest success of the first two films is how it handles the human stories of love and lost. This is a classic example of why the comic book and films have been so well received. They touch on something very real in all of us and even though its presented against a very unrealistic backdrop, the emotions are still very much real. James Franco is especially effective in this film and I believe he's mostly the reason why this aspect of the story works so well. His character goes through the best arc and he manages to make Harry conflicted and very interesting. Adding the personality altering aspect of Spider-Man's new 'black personna' offers some great parallels between the two characters. Peter's thirst for revenge against Flint Marko mirrors Harry's thirst for revenge against Peter/Spider-Man. The change in personality also offers some interesting darker elements to the story. The scene in the jazz club with Peter, Mary Jane, and Gwen Stacey is equal parts funny and disturbing as it escalates to violence. This element of the story isn't given enough time to shine but when it does, the movie becomes much more interesting.The action is very good, even though this another case of quick edits substituting for 'true action'. The first action sequence with Harry and Peter is effective and well handled and all the CGI scenes with Sandman are a wonder to behold. Sam Raimi is definitely utilizing every penny of the budget and you can tell it was money well spent. The action only takes a wrong turn during the final battle because everything sort of ends on a rather anti-climatic note. All the action sequences that come before it are more compelling.The acting is top notch, even though the cheesiness of the script sometimes threatens a few effective performances. Tobey Maguire is at home in this role and he's quite good here. I didn't realize this until now but this guy can cry with the best of them. The break-up scene between he and Mary Jane on the bridge is heartbreaking mainly because his emotion feels so genuine and intense. He also handles the transition into more aggressive material quite well. At first I thought he wouldn't be able to play mean, but he does it very well. Kirsten Dunst is effective as well but the script cheats her the most. The script makes her character rather unlikable and it's a testament of Dunst's talent that she can make you feel sorry for her despite the way the character is written. She also handles her emotional scenes quite well and she has a very good chemistry with Maguire. Franco and Church were already mentioned for their good turns and newer additions like Topher Grace and Bryce Dallas Howard are good, but vastly underused. This is especially a shame for Grace because he's really good in his scenes but the movie doesn't develop him enough at all, even though he's being set up to be a big villain. Noward is suitably likable and sexy as Gwen Stacey and she offers a cute performance but in the end, she isn't given enough to do. I will say that whenever she was on screen I wished Peter would drop Mary Jane and focus on her.I really think that people are going to come out of this film feeling the same way they did when they saw X3. That film was a fun popcorn movie but lacked the emotional depth of the first two films. It was also rather bloated and tried to add too much within the story. Spider-Man 3 is a decent way to start off the Summer movie season and it's still a worth companion piece to the other films but I do hope that the other major blockbusters to be released this summer just give us a little bit more than this film did.",6,0,1,4 May 2007
Final Destination 2," Just as good as the first
","The movie opens by referencing the first film, Final Destination. We learn that this is the one year anniversary of the explosion of Flight 180 (the big event that triggered the events of Final Destination). A girl is sleeping in her room with the television on. The program is a news broadcast covering the anniversary. The guest on the show talks about how death has a design, a plan and if that plan is interrupted, people are more likely to die in strange ways just so that death's plan is not too messed up. This was also the plot of the first Final Destination movie and being a direct sequel, we know this will be a major part of Final Destination 2.After the scene setting the stage for the movie, we move into the actual plot line of the movie. Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) and 3 of her friends are taking a road trip. They are stopped on an on-ramp to get onto the freeway. We see Kimberly merge onto the road and keep driving, and there is a huge accident, visually impressive. Even this multiple vehicle (and I do mean multiple) accident comes up with some creative way to kill folks. Everyone dies. The scene shifts and Kimberly is still on the on-ramp. It was only a vision and it freaked her out. She stops her van sideways on the on-ramp and nobody gets on the highway. The officer trying to get Kimberly to calm down is a witness to a horrible accident that happens just as Kimberly said it would. She saved the life of everyone on the on-ramp, except for her three friends who are still in the van as it gets run down by a semi.Back at the police station, Kimberly is insisting that everyone who survived will die in a specific order and only the police officer on the scene believes her. It isn't until the first survivor dies that people start believing. To try to figure this out and find a way to beat it, Kimberly goes to get help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor from Flight 180, and the only survivor from the aftermath. The rest of the movie follows Kimberly as she tries to save everyone from being randomly killed. She continues to have visions and picks up on signs of what may be coming.The real joy of this movie is in the creative and inventive death scenes. Sure, some are a little gruesome and I cringed a couple of times, but they were so well thought out that I couldn't wait to see how the next person would be killed. Final Destination 2 is not any different from the first movie, but because of the creativity of the deaths, I didn't mind at all. I like how the movie teased me with one kind of death but turned it into something completely different but equally impressive. Anytime I thought I figured out a death, the movie turned it to something else. It kept me on edge waiting for the next kill and the movie had a perfect flow to it. I'm not sure if the movie is better than the first, but it is just as good. If you've seen the first movie, you know exactly what you are getting into. If you haven't, this is a fun movie with a lot of creative kills. The movie exceeds the quality of its subject matter and is actually a pretty good movie.",9,0,0,1 July 2006
10 Things I Hate About You," Great teen flick!
","Being an advocate of the claim that you can find good movies in every film genre, it's always nice to see movies coming out to support my point! The genre of teen movies is considered by many as an easy target for criticism, which of course is not completely unjustified. Nevertheless, films belonging to that genre are not necessarily full of flaws. '10 things I hate about you' is such an example.I have not read Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew' so I cannot say if the script of '10 things I hate about you' is close to the Bard's original work, from which it was inspired. What I can say though, is that '10 things I hate about you' is a fresh, witty movie with sharp dialogs and a rather interesting set of characters.The plot: What can you do when your high school love interest is not allowed to go on a date with you, unless her older sister first goes on a date herself? What about becoming an ally with your main rival in order to find a guy capable of dating the older sister?Larisa Oleynik plays Bianca, the pretty, always in fashion but rather shallow, younger sister. Kat (Julia Stiles) is the older sister. She is the one that has to go on a date first, if her younger sister can go out too. The problem is that Kat is unpopular and 'incapable of human interaction'. Bianca immediately catches the attention of Cameron (Joseph-Gordon Levitt), the likable, smart (how else would he be able to learn French so quickly??), and shy, new boy on the block. Cameron with his friend (David Krumholtz, in a role that provides some good moments of laugh) will have to try and persuade the wild and scary Patrick (Heath Ledger), who may not be that wild and scary after all, to go out with Kat. Of course, there is the 'bad' guy, played by Andrew Keegan, who will try to mess things up, just when everything seems to lead to a happy ending.I especially liked the Kat-Patrick couple. Stiles and Ledger definitely have the required chemistry and are able to make us believe how their relationship gradually develops into genuine love.Apart from the main characters, a big asset of the film is the supporting characters, like the English teacher (who makes a habit of throwing Kat out of his class, without any apparent reason) or the sex-obsessed counselor (who tries hard to find fitting words for her new novel...)Overall, '10 things I hate about you' offers quite a number of moments of genuine laughter, without ever resorting to cheap or crude humor. It is a movie that you will enjoy, if you know what to expect.",9,1,2,1 August 2006
The Exorcist," Only movie that has truly scared me
","Back in 1973 when this terrifying shocker first came out, the reactions from movie audiences were all over the place. Some people came out of the movie nearly collapsing off of their feet; some people checked into therapy after seeing it; some people actually vomited in the theater; some people were so scared that they ran out of the theater and never came back. Whatever the reactions were, THE EXORCIST certainly has one of the most powerful reactions from any horror movie ever made. No one had any clue that director William Friedkin was out to make what is quite possibly the scariest film ever made of all time. After the first time you see this movie, even you will have trouble sleeping at night for at least a week.Linda Blair is terrific as the little girl who goes to hell and back, Regan; Max Von Sydow is terrific as Father Merrin; Jason Miller plays Father Karras to a tee; and Ellen Burstyn is perfect as Regan's mother. All of these actors convey such depth and emotion, and Blair truly is terrifying when she becomes the demon and speaks in the demon's voice. It...is...shocking.The story centers around a little girl named Regan, one of the nicest girls on the planet. She loves horses, plays games and jokes with her mother, and seems like the most down to earth kid. Little does she know of the terror that truly awaits her as the movie progresses. We know that Chris is an actress and quite a reputable one at that. As the movie goes on, Regan is getting a check up at the doctor's office when a most terrifying face is seen for a split second as she stares at the ceiling, and then suddenly she is quietly taken over by the demon. If you pause the movie right when the face comes up, you will get shivers down your spine. Just the way it looks at you and is smiling and the eyes, everything is just VERY scary. You won't notice it at first, but later Regan's behavior begins to change, especially after her outburst in the doctor's office. But it doesn't end there.As soon as Regan gets home, all the bad stuff begins to start unravelling one by one. One event that occurs where you know things are going terribly wrong is when Chris walks into the room and finds the windows all open with the chill in the air and Regan not under covers but facing down on her bed. The fact that you can see breath is chilling, but just knowing Regan is going to wreak havoc is absolutely terrifying. There are a two moments in the movie where 'demon' Regan's head spins, but the first time you see it is dreadfully unsettling. According to Wes Craven, at that moment some lady got up from her seat, was screaming Spanish and ran out of the theater. The fact that director William Friedkin has no inhibitions about what he was going to show made the movie more powerful, minute by minute. Father Merrin has been made aware of the nature of Regan's 'demonic' behavior by Father Karras, so they ultimately decide to perform an exorcism, and that scene between Regan, Merrin, and Karras has to be one of the most classic scenes in any horror movie. Every time you hear the demon voice, see Regan in demon form, or see the bed shake or vomit spit, you jump back from your seat. It's a movie that's all about reaching deep down into the 'chill' factor of your soul.Despite the sheer terror and frightening scenes depicted in this movie, there is no real gore and no real sex in the movie, despite the scene involving Regan and the crucifix. The film is actually stronger without any of those elements, it's an ultimately terrifying experience. The actors; the suspense; the demon effects and makeup; the storyline. Every element in this film works better than any other horror movie made in history.THE EXORCIST is at least one of the most horrifying experiences you'll ever witness in your life. Heralded as a classic by both critics and fans alike, this movie will stay in your mind for a long time. This is the most realistic and most documentary-like film about the portrayal of demonic possession. William Friedkin, you may have been genius, but this movie is pure madness...reach into the scare factor of your soul and watch THE EXORCIST...but never, I repeat, never watch it alone...and in the dark.",10,2,4,28 May 2006
Pearl Harbor," Run for the hills! It's a positive review!!!!
","I'll just say this and bring it to the table; Pearl Harbor ain't that bad.Have you clicked that 'No' button yet? Great, I'll continue.Depicting history on the silver screen is no easy task; critics and historical purists wait in eager anticipation to pounce on a shading that's not quite right or a spent bullet casing that rolls left instead of right in the heat of a battle. To even consider doing a dramatization of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, in this era of endless information and minutiae, is a bold act in itself, and the filmmakers deserve a nod of credit right out of the chute just for attempting it. And, happily, they deserve still more credit, as 'Pearl Harbor,' directed by Michael Bay, goes on to successfully capture the pain, pathos, angst, frustration and fear born of that day that 'Will live in infamy.' Told through the lives of two lifelong friends, Captain Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Captain Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), this is a movie of epic proportions presented on a personal level, which enables the audience to connect with the story on an emotional level and not just as an observer of a reenacted historical event. And when Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart (Kate Beckinsale) enters the story, it becomes even more involving, and as it builds in intimacy-- juxtaposed against these monumental events as they unfold-- it creates that empathy that really puts the viewer in the picture and gives that sense of total involvement. This is nothing new to storytelling, of course; writers and movie makers have long understood that when dealing with events that are complex and larger than life, they have to be concentrated and presented from a personal perspective to effect a truly appreciable impact, and as James Cameron proved with 'Titanic,' there's no better way to do it than with a love story.Without that intimacy between the characters, which is what provides the audience with a frame of reference and a specific element with which the viewer can identify, the impact of all that eventually happens would be significantly diminished. Like Cameron (and many others before him), Bay recognizes this, and the approach he takes is therefore very effective. By the time the attack comes, you know and care about the people involved, and it gives the tragedy of that day a personal, rather than just a national or historic perspective. And though all that follows is visually stunning, it's that personal focus-- that singular involvement that's been so carefully crafted-- that predominates the moment and makes all the difference as far as what you're feeling and experiencing as you watch these horrific and horrendous events play out.Bay is also successful in evoking a true sense of time and place with this film, and he does it not only with authentic settings and visuals, but by giving the film itself a sense of cinematic sensibility that makes it more reminiscent of films like 'Bombardier,' 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo' and 'The Bridges At Toko-Ri,' than the more recent 'Saving Private Ryan' (though it does have 'Ryan's' same level of realism). It's easy, in fact, to envision this film had it been made fifty or so years ago, with a cast that would've included Dana Andrews, Van Johnson and Gene Tierney as the principals, with Randolph Scott, Pat O'Brien and Eddie Albert in supporting roles.Heading up this cast, Affleck and Hartnett give strong, engaging performances, as does Kate Beckinsale, who successfully manages to take her character to a level beyond that of simply being the romantic interest of the story. She makes Evelyn believable by responding honestly to the complexities of her character's situation, which in turn adds to the overall credibility of the fictionalized part of the story. If there's an element in the story at all, in fact, that could be deemed questionable, it may be Rafe's reaction (some may argue, 'over-reaction') to his personal situation; it is not, however, a reflection on Affleck's ability as an actor-- he gives a satisfying, credible performance-- but merely a subjective evaluation of his character's motivation.Giving memorable performances in supporting roles are Ewen Bremner as Lieutenant Red Winkle, and James King as Nurse Betty. Also Notable, are Alec Baldwin as Lieutenant colonel Jimmy Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Dorie Miller, a Navy cook who rises to the occasion during the attack (though Gooding does bring a bit of melodrama to his portrayal), and especially Jon Voight, who is excellent in the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Tom Sizemore, however, as Sergeant Earl Sistern, falls into stereotype, and with the brim of his hat turned up comes across like an actor playing William Bendix playing a role in a war movie more than anything else. In his defense, though, he does seem to do the best he can with the material he is given, and it is a fairly small part with little time for development.The additional supporting cast includes William Lee Scott (Lieutenant Billy Thompson), Jennifer Garner (Nurse Sandra), Mako (Admiral Yamamoto), Colm Feore (Admiral Kimmel), Leland Orser (Major Jackson), Scott Wilson (General Marshall), Peter Firth (Bennion) and Sara Rue (Nurse Martha). One more qualified than I will have to comment on the historical 'accuracy' of the film, but without question, 'Pearl Harbor' succeeds in conveying the magnitude, scope and significance of the attack, and does it in a way that is emotionally involving and memorable. It depicts a moment in history that-- regardless of how dark and horrible-- must never be forgotten; and, even as Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' did much to preserve their respective moments in history, so will this film help to insure that December 7, 1941, will forever be remembered.",8,4,8,15 May 2006
The Number 23," Not as bad as the critics say but still flawed....
","The Number 23 is a victim of the concept being much better than the execution. There is a decent plot here to create a very compelling thriller but the script cheats the film on many occasions. It's unfortunate because the film is drenched in a very hypnotic style and the performances are top notch. I suppose the script needed many more revisions before it went into production because what we have here is a fairly interesting, yet flawed movie going experience.Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) is leading a seemingly normal life with a seemingly normal wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen), and a seemingly normal son, Robin (Logan Lerman). Everything changes the day his wife purchases a copy of a book entitled The Number 23 at a used bookstore. The book is about the obsession of the main character, a detective named Fingerling, with the number 23 in its various permutations. Walter becomes obsessed with the book. He senses an eerie connection between himself and Fingerling and, like the protagonist, he believes there's something important about how often 23 appears in his life. A psychologist friend (Danny Huston) suggests that he sees 23 everywhere because he's looking for 23 everywhere, but Walter ignores this sensible advice and begins to imagine conspiracies and murders.This film currently sits with an 8% at Rotten Tomatoes.com which probably makes it one of the first truly univerally panned films of 2007. I'm here to say that the film isn't nearly as bad as those reviews would indicate. In my opinion this isn't a great film or even a very good one, but it isn't a film that should be thrown away and forgotten. There are a few things to rave about. I'm going to take a moment to take up for Joel Schumacher. Many people called him a hack after he destroyed the Batman franchise with Batman & Robin. After this debacle many people seemed to forget that Schumacher is capable of making really good films. Before Batman & Robin he gave us The Lost Boys, Flatliners, Falling Down, and A Time To Kill. After Batman & Robin he gave us Tiger Land, Phone Booth, and Veronica Guerin. These are all good films in their own right. He applies this visual approach to The Number 23. For the scenes within the book he creates a very compelling neo-noir world that is actually quite engaging to watch. I almost wish the whole film took place within this setting. Schumacher surely knows how to create style and its one of the best things about this film. I refuse to blame him anymore for Batman & Robin because after watching the special features on that DVD, it's clear that the film fell victim to studio interference. I think everyone should take a look back and re-examine how they feel about Mr. Schumacher.The acting also works well. I was a bit worried about Jim Carrey being in this film because I didn't think he could handle certain aspects of the role. I don't question his abilities as a dramatic actor since he was quite good in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Truman Show. My concern was whether or not he could play the paranoia associated with the role and thankfully he showed me he could. This is a very nice turn from Carrey and it will probably be forgotten because the film hasn't received many great notices. It's not the best performance of his career but it's definitely something different forhim. As the Fingerling character within the book, he is oddly engaging. He does things with his body language and his eyes that are very subtle and effective. Virginia Madsen is saddled with the supportive wife role but she makes the most of it and probably makes it more compelling than it was on the written page. I think Madsen is a very good actress and it's nice to see her getting more exposure since she was in Sideways. She is also a wonder to watch during the neo-noir scenes but she is in too few of them. Her and Carrey share a decent chemistry that works well for the film.Too bad the script lets them down. The 23 Enigma is an interesting concept and sometimes the film uses it well but it ultimately plays second fiddle to a rather bland murder mystery plot. If you pay enough attention the conclusion is easy to figure out and once you do, you have to suffer through 15 minutes of an elaborate explanation. It's unnecessary and poorly done. The last act of this film is truly a mess. The script becomes a muddled mess and the film ends with a whimper rather than a bang. It cheats some of the decent ideas that came before it and makes the film end on a very sour note. The film also has way too many cheesy moments that had the audience laughing unintentionally. I could've done without the dog popping up everywhere (it makes sense if you've seen the film) and some of the dialogue between the characters is a little unnatural.The Number 23 has an interesting concept but unfortunately the film doesn't do much with. I can only recommend this for some of the nice visual tricks and fine performances, but even with that, I don't think it will be enough to satisfy the audience. You want the numbers to add up but they never do in this valiant, yet flawed effort.",5,2,4,14 April 2007
The Evil Dead," Evil Dead, revisionist hype and the abuse of superlatives
","This is, without any doubt, one of the worst films ever made. I'm not a film snob or punk trying to antagonize the deluded legion of dupes who idolize this piece of garbage. I'm just trying to provide balance to the roars of approval for this not-at-all-good 'film.' Seriously people, have you even watched this stupid thing? It is AWFUL (and not even in an 'Ed Wood meets Dead Alive meets tongue-in-cheek' way)! There is, and I want this to be crystal clear, NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIE! NOTHING...ZERO...ZILCH!!! Save your stars (seriously, TEN stars for this crap - ARE YOU INSANE?!) for a movie that delivers...anything. Can we please relegate Sam Raimi and this 'train wreck' to the pile of hyped up hacks and 'cult faves' where they belong?!",1,22,47,30 May 2006
Saw," Sorry but after 3 viewings I still do not get the hype...
","I usually rewatch films several times when the general consensus says they are good and I don't initially agree, just to see what exactly I missed (if anything). Well, I've watched Saw three times now (most recently, a few nights ago) and I am still trying to figure out what's so great about it. Possibly it is 'decent' or 'promising'... but classic? I just don't see it. Instead of getting better with each viewing, the problems of this one just become more and more apparent the more times you watch it.I don't want to go on a HUGE rant but this movie is just too uneven all the way around. First off, any film that uses generic industrial metal on the soundtrack and 'flashy' editing just to be 'edgy' is automatically annoying out of the gate as far as I'm concerned. The general premise is fairly good (at least better than most), but the plot is full of holes and riddled with coincidences. In fact, in many ways Jigsaw's plan will completely fall apart if people in that cast don't do incredibly stupid, implausible things, which they of course do. And while we're on Jigsaw; he's basically just a less interesting version of Kevin Spacey's character in Se7en. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell's acting was uneven, downright bad at times. And don't get me started on Elwes' wife in this movie. What a stupid twit. Danny Glover's detective character had muddled motivations to be sure, plus I just didn't care about him and was basically annoyed and bored with any of the scenes that cut away from the bathroom. The dialogue was poor a good deal of the time as well. And the ending... whoa boy, no comment.It's cool if you love this movie. I don't want to be a complete ass about it but I just don't really understand its popularity, its reputation or its 7.6 rating on IMDb, which implies its one of the greatest horror films of all time.",2,1,2,2 August 2006
From Hell," Very ingtriguing look at the Jack The Ripper case
","Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is not your typical Scotland Yard inspector. He has visions of crimes that he tries to suppress or embrace, depending on his mood, with drugs such as opium, laudanum and absinthe. Luckily, he has Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) to help keep him on task. It is the sergeant who takes Inspector Abberline out to the scene of the first victim in the notorious Whitechapel district of 1888 London. Most of the investigators believe that the slain prostitute is nothing to worry about and not unusual at all given her profession. But Inspector Abberline notices some unusual things about the corpse, like the surgeon-like precision of the wounds and the expensive cluster of grapes near her hand. How could a prostitute afford grapes and what kind of client would have hated her enough to do this? As Inspector Abberline looks into the murder, he comes across Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute who knew the victim and is convinced that the local boss is trying to scare them into paying what they owe. But Abberline doesn't think it is that simple. As he spends more time with Mary, he comes to discover that the first prostitute who disappeared left a daughter and that she was no longer working the streets, but had found a special man, an artist, who loved her and was taking care of her. Mary convinces the inspector to find her and Abberline does, but she is in an insane asylum and seems to have the mind of a child. Abberline turns to the noted ex-surgeon Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) to explain the procedure that made her so and to help give him insights on how a surgeon would have used the tools of his trade on the murdered prostitute. The more Inspector Abberline delves into the seemingly unrelated stories, the more he is convinced that they are linked. So when Abberline discovers that the artist lover is in fact the Prince, he suddenly comes to realize that the prostitutes who are being murdered all have one thing in common....This was a very intriguing look at the Jack the Ripper tale with an interesting premise and solution to the seemingly unsolvable and random crimes. The directors did a wonderful job at creating a very dark and creepy atmosphere on the film that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat even when there is nothing scary going on. I also liked their artful visions of the murders and their restraint in showing or not showing details and leaving it up to the viewers imagination to fill in the blanks. Johnny Depp was superb in his role as Inspector Abberline, as he always is, and you found yourself cheering him on and wishing him every happiness, yet knowing that he wouldn't allow himself to be happy. Heather Graham was quite convincing in her role as a poor British prostitute, but her accent was not quite right. However, it is Ian Holm who really fools the viewers and keeps you in suspense as his character rapidly unravels at the end of the film. However, with all of the film strengths I still had to give it 7 stars because it is just missing that certain something that makes a good film a great film. The plot was a little hard to follow at times and I didn't care for some of the characters, but if you are at all interested in the famous Ripper crimes then this is a movie you shouldn't miss!",7,2,4,10 May 2006
The Descent," A must see for any horror fan!
","A group of friends go on a caving expedition only to be assailed by a pack of carnivorous, subhuman monsters. This will doubtless cause many ignorant individuals to suppose that this film is a knockoff of 'The Cave', but hopefully the superior quality and craftsmanship of the film will carry it during its American release. Either way, horror aficionados will know the score, and that Neil Marshall has clearly established himself as one of the most, probably the most, promising up and coming horror director of the new millennium.Marshall says, in interviews, that his prime inspiration for the film is the early 70's classic 'Deliverance'. This may seems a little strange at first glance, but they have a lot in common under the surface: Both focus on a group of friends who enjoy going on athletic, adventurous vacations only to find that they've now bitten off more than they can chew, facing dangers from both murderous individuals and the natural setting itself. Of course, replacing 'rafting' and 'crazy rednecks' with 'caving' and 'monsters' is a pretty substantial reworking, but it's not tough to believe that this is where Marshall got his main inspiration. In contrast to the all-male major cast of that film we've got an all female ensemble here. We've got 6 people here, perhaps a few too many to allow for any real characterization of a couple of them. (i.e. Sam and Becca) Other then them we've got Sarah, who is somewhat more timid and low-key then most of the others, partially due to the tragic accident which occurred during their last trip. Then we've got Juno, the one American and the authoritative leader of the group, and her reckless Irish protégé Holly plus Sarah's best friend Beth. Again, we don't get to know all of these characters terribly well, as there is little time for characterization prior to their horrific adventure, but they at least aren't the obnoxious clichés you'd find in most horror films, and Marshall manages to create some real pain and sadness in their deaths.'The Descent' uses an interesting, very effective tactic that you might recognize from Hitchcock films like 'Psycho' and 'The Birds': The film pretends like you are watching a completely different movie from the one you really are up until the point where things really fall apart. This isn't like in some horror films, where they just kinda sit around for an hour before the killing starts, as we've got an actual plot and conflict here: Shortly after entering the cave the entrance collapses, trapping them all inside a previously unexplored cavern which may or may not have another exit. Thus, they have to deal with a wide variety of concerns prior to the appearance of the monsters, including a gruesome compound fracture where they have to cram the bones back into her leg in order to splint it. There are relatively few hints that anything is actually going on prior to the appearance of the monsters, and I suspect that anyone who watched this completely blind would likely be in for a big surprise. This plot works because the pre-monster spelunking is generally very interesting and quite suspenseful. Lotsa horror movies, even good ones, tend to wear out there welcome and become excessively repetitious, but 'The Descent' avoids the pitfall entirely.Once the crawlers show up things really get out of control, and the film is just this side of incoherent, as the various characters are separated, wandering around looking for each other, hiding, and fighting the crawlers etc. A monster movie needs a good monster to work, and the Crawlers are quite cool. Not truly remarkable or anything, but nasty and gruesome enough to be effective. Needless to say this film is extremely dark, not so much that scenes are poorly lit, but that many portions of the screen are not lit at all, with nothing but flashlights to illuminate it. At a few moments I literally could not tell what the hell was going on the first time I watched it, but these are rare enough that it's not too big of a problem. One minor concern is that the characters are frequently extremely tough to tell apart in the later scenes, but honestly it doesn't really make that much of a difference who is who. Personally, I didn't really find this movie scary, but it is intense and severely watchable, which is just as good. That's another nice thing about the long, buildup, as that it allows Marshall to throw everything at us in the climactic 35 or so minutes, and the film is just unrelenting from the first encounter on.Many have claimed this film is old-fashioned, and while that it true in many ways, that isn't correct regarding the violent encounters, which are exceedingly modern, particularly reminding me of '28 Days Later'. Here Marshall uses incredibly frantic editing, sometimes makes the movement haphazard and jerky by speeding up the action or cutting frames. (Or, I think that's what is being done, anyway.) This sorta modern presenting it is risky, and many films like this are tiresome and incoherent, but they get it just right here, making it genuinely chaotic but maintaining coherence. I should also mention that the film is fairly gruesome. It doesn't linger on the gore, but there's plenty of spurting blood and flesh eating going on.The ending of the film is somewhat controversial, and I neither particularly like nor dislike it. Ending horror movies is pretty tough, so I'm pleased as long as you don't blow it, and they didn't do so here. And yeah they did change it for the American release. I've seen both and don't particularly prefer either ending. Despite what you may have head, I don't think the American ending suggests anything different, I think it is still implying what was explicitly shown in the original ending, but whatever.",10,2,5,5 August 2006
Titanic," One of the greatest films of our time
","I've noticed recently how various critics and the general population treat Titanic horribly with the test of time. I find it shocking how a movie that was regarded as one of the best movies of all time has fallen ill to tons of criticisms. People seem to find it hip now days to bash Titanic and I fail to understand why. I personally find it to be the greatest movie I've seen, the Academy Awards seemed to think it was a pretty damn good movie, the critics when it first came out weren't too harsh and movie-goer's truly expressed how the general population felt about Titanic with the gigantic ticket sales.Now, however, Titanic makes the 'overblown movie' lists from several critics, endures extreme mockery and the ridicule of anyone who actually admits to liking it. This may have been due to people wanting to be different from the norm in 1997 and maybe this attitude never went away and too many people fell victim to it. Or maybe it was the cheesy scene's people like to imitate over and over which obviously must mean the entire movie is cheesy. However, I recently watched Titanic the other day and I'm going to say why I find it to my favorite movie of all time.The ship Titanic itself expressed a mentality during this time period in which humans felt they could overcome Mother Nature. With the sinking of this ship it made people truly eat the words 'Titanic is an unsinkable ship.'With the character Rose, a first class passenger you are exposed to the arrogance high society had. Rose also opened your eyes to the luxuries high society had and how woman were truly trapped and were seen as second-class citizens. Rose almost committing suicide helps hit home how truly horrible it must have been for woman during this time period. The dynamics between Rose and her mother also show the dynamics between how woman had to behave and in a sense how they survived in this society.With the character Jack, a third class passenger you are exposed to how large the gab between the rich and poor was. How first class dogs went down to be walked on the lower decks, how it was the poor who actually built Titanic and how it was the poor who were treated truly unfair on Titanic just because of social status, which helped express the mentality of the time.Having these two characters meet and expose the viewer and each other to these different lifestyles helped truly put into perspective the mentality of what this time period was like. Sure, it was in a way a clichée love story, two people from different world's falling in love. But regardless of it being typical it still exposed the different classes in a way that truly made you realize how it was for people back then. Also, many things are cliché' for a reason, they most of the time work and have been shown to work time and time again.Without this love story you would have just come away with the basics of this story, the Titanic sinking. But this love story created sympathy in which you felt for Jack and Rose. It made you truly feel how the people on the Titanic were feeling at that exact moment. Families, loved ones and friends were being torn apart. Without the emotion created from the love story you wouldn't have felt nearly as sad or seriously towards what had actually happened to these people.As for it being morally wrong on the part of Rose. Well, she was trapped by her mother and society. The man (Cal) whom she was getting married to proved to be inconsiderate towards others, was very mean, rude and thoughtless (even before he knew of the situation between Rose and Jack). He deserved and was asking for everything he got. What Rose did was what many do in youth and sometimes you have to take what life gives you at that moment. That's exactly what she did and people shouldn't say her actions were immoral. They were done out of love at first sight and out of vengeance towards the arrogant class she was apart of.Titanic was very authentic and very historically accurate. It did include a lot more then just the love story. It had information about the lifeboats, the binoculars, how exactly it sank, the famous people aboard the ship, and numerous other things. Even things such as the first-class band and their situation, what exactly was sung on the last time day light hit the Titanic at the morning church gathering, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings and many more examples were all little details included in this movie which made it far more then just a 'love story' if you actually paid attention.One of the major flaws people say this movie had was the acting. I however thought it had amazing acting and I saw nothing wrong with it. Acting is something that is hard to pin-point in terms of being good or bad. I find it an easy way to attack any film. If you say the acting is bad, you cannot really 'prove' to that person it was good. Acting is something that just goes to personal opinion and you cannot really change someone's mind on it. I personally give an A+ for acting and even the script. But one thing to consider is that many shots could only be done a few times or even once because of what they had to do to the sets, making it sometimes hard to get the perfect take.Overall, one the best movies ever made.",10,0,2,8 May 2006
War of the Worlds," A 'War of the Worlds' to remember!
","Every aspect of this project was handled with the utmost perfection. Spielberg has taken the core outline of the H.G. Wells novel, a man seeking to reunite with his wife, and given us something even more compelling. Tom Cruise, in this updated story, is left with the daunting task of transporting his two children to safety amidst the chaotic devastation being wrought by bloodthirsty invaders from space. A great many critical people, it would seem to that effect, had a problem with this change. More directly, these individuals took an instant dislike towards Dakota Fanning and her constant screaming throughout the movie. Certain viewers apparently found her demeanor 'annoying' and 'unrealistic.' Allow me, if I may, to take a rather fair look at that and offer my own sensible input. Consider the possibility that we were invaded on such a vast scale. Can anybody honestly show me one child of Dakota's age that wouldn't be in hysterics over what was happening? I didn't think so. Children, we tend to forget, are not adults. They frighten far easier than somebody much later in life and, taking into account that nobody within this story knew what to expect from one moment to the next.And let us not forget the tripods! Finally, for the first time, we have actual alien tripod war-machines as precise and accurate as H.G. Wells envisioned them. These machines make this movie the utterly effective and terrifying experience that it is. From the moment they are introduced, we are never fully able to shake the image of sheer destruction they leave in their wake. And that, of course, leads me to my next line of discussion. What exactly is with all these constant attacks on the backstory with the tripods? They were, as we learn in the film, planted within the earth 10,000 years in the past. Certain viewers seem to feel the invaders should have therefore planned their attack around a timeframe where we humans had zero means of defending ourselves. Why? What difference would that make? Read whatever you want into this, but I personally do not find the idea of alien invaders nuking a bunch of neanderthals all that enticing. Nobody among us saw the 9/11 attacks before they happened. That assault, in as much the same vein as the invasion within this 'War,' literally came out of nowhere. So many disgruntled viewers who saw this unfold also seem to believe they needed the reason why we were being invaded spoon-fed to them. I have to mention this because I've stumbled across this subject in several other reviews written by people who claim their enjoyment was dampered by this specific lack of information. This silliness only begs me to revisit the scenario I posed here earlier. So allow me to ask everyone again, who may be reading this, what they would do in the midst of an actual invasion. Would any of you really care in the end why aliens from outer space were reducing your friends and neighbors to smoldering ash, or would you be more concerned with ducking for cover like everyone else? I honestly do not mind the fact that we all form our own opinions about different genres of film. That diversity, after all, is part of what makes us the unique individuals we are. But, if somebody insists on negating any specific portion of the particular film they happen to be watching, they should probably ensure beforehand that their gripe is steeped in some manner of common sense.The same can also be said for all these Cruise-bashers who are somehow finding an altogether stupid means of working Scientology into this movie. I thought many of the reasons people were slamming it were pathetic enough on their own, but this one tops them all! Can somebody please explain to me why the fact Tom Cruise embraces Scientology should have anything to do with 'War of the Worlds?' I personally do not care about or buy into anything regarding this brand of rhetoric. If I did, I would never have bothered paying to see this movie in the first place. What an actor does in his private life is completely and totally secondary to whether or not he can make me believe and invest in what I am seeing on the screen. Why is it that so many of us fail to recognize that? If somebody despises Tom Cruise to such an extreme degree, logic should dictate that they do not waste their money or time with any of his projects.Now, I could easily take this line of banter much farther. But I will instead leave you to make whatever conclusions you choose upon experiencing this spectacular movie for yourself. You cannot afford to fall into the trap of trying to compare it to the novel or the 1952 film. If you can simply try and enjoy this movie for what it is on its own merits, you will definitely find yourself having a better time. This is, after all, Steven Spielberg we're talking about. The man clearly knows what he's doing! He, however, is not the only one who should be commended. I must also tip my hat to everyone who contributed to the phenomenal special effects. Watching Tom Cruise running for his life, coated with the ashy remains of people who weren't so lucky, was nothing short of exhilarating! This standout scene early on in the story, like so many others this amazing film had to its credit, worked me over to the point where I was literally on the edge of my seat. When a movie can do that to me, I know my money was well spent.",8,1,2,14 May 2006
Scream 2," Just as good if not better then the original
","'Scream 2' is possibly the best horror movie sequel ever, and that's because it stays in touch with the ideas and plot structure of the first film, relying on the old clichés to give us another fresh and involving thriller. I'd even go so far as to say that this movie is superior to its predecessor, and that judgement lies with the character development and its comical treatment of the subject matter, while also being as cunning and inventive as 'Scream,' keeping us at bay until the unexpected resolution.'Scream 2' is a parodical look at the first film, beginning with a special screening of the new movie 'Stab,' which is based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' written by Gale Weathers. At the screening, two college students are brutally murdered by a man in that same old ghost mask. Not that he/she would be easy to spot: the studio gave away 'Stab' costumes to all the audience members, and everyone is running all over the place. The whole movie angle provides for some of the tension, because no one believes that the murders are interconnected, perpetuating the action.Soon, news of the murder gets back to Sidney Prescott, now a college student, who consults Randy, also at college, on what he thinks is going on. She now has a potential boyfriend, Derek, who appears to genuinely care for her, and friends Mickey and Halle, typical college students who are put into the story for good measure.Or are they? Like 'Scream,' the sequel also makes everyone out to be a possible suspect through their actions and their words, which keeps the suspense unbearable in wanting to know who the killer is. As Sidney and others have their own opinions, reporter Gale Weathers, now a network reporter, retrieves her old ambitions and does everything to get the story, with exhonerated convict Cotton Weary, the man formerly accused of Sidney's mother's murder, chasing her for airtime. Not to mention the pesky reporter who looks up to Gale with every inch of her being.The film's shock quotient is extremely high, keeping us involved and wanting to know who is going to get killed next. Most of the murdered characters are secondary, leading up to murders of certain important actors that point to other as the suspects. The plot has all the machinations and clichés of the first film, again using it to its advantage in propelling its plot forward while giving those old horror tactics a fresh new look.What really makes this movie shine over the predecessor is the characterization of its characters. The Sidney of this movie is much stronger, much more stable than in the first movie, which provides a lot in keeping the movie going. Neve Campbell reprises her role, and does some of the best acting of the movie. The relationship between Deputy Dewey and Gale Weathers is intensified further here, and Courteney Cox and David Arquette are the perfect pair for the job. Cox especially shines here, bringing out more of Gale's ambitions which later become replaced with fear. Liev Schreiber portrays Cotton Weary, who really has nothing to do here but follow people around, but watch out for his chance to save the day.Telling you anymore than I already have will spoil the movie, which is full of surprises and stunning twists. This movie has a more adult feel than the first, which will provide for even more entertainment to moviegoers. There is so much fun to be had with 'Scream 2,' which is solid entertainment full of suspense and intelligence.",8,0,0,25 July 2006
Jaws," The essential shark movie
","Jaws is one of those instant classics that affect anyone who watches it in any new generation. Just watch, 20 years from now people are going to be just as scared as they were 31 years ago. The movie is what TRUE horror movies are, with the Alfred Hitchcock style of not really seeing the blood and gore during most of the movie, as well as terror and suspense at an all time high.When a young woman's remains wash up on a beach by a Long Island town named Amity, the only person who suspects something more sinister than a boating accident is the chief of police ,played by Roy Scheider. He thinks it was a shark, and the only person who believes him is a shark expert ,played by Richard Dreyfuss, who concludes that it is a Great White who is responsible.Instead of listening to the warnings to shut the beaches down, the mayor of the town continues to hold them open. After all, the next day is the Fourth of July, and they really can't shut the beaches down on the biggest tourist attraction event of the year can they? So the beaches remain open and the worst happens. A young boy is attacked by a shark and killed. After several decisions and arguments on what to do, the one thing agreed on is that an expedition needs to hunt the shark down and kill it. In enters an old mariner named Quint ,played by Robert Shaw, who leads the Sheriff and Shark Specialist in a hunt for the shark to kill it.The sequence on the boat during the second half of the movie is worth the price of the DVD alone. The three men realize that the shark is hunting them, instead of the other way around. Despite shooting at it, harpooning it, and even trying to drag it home, what happens in the end is what made people respect horror films for what real movie making is.If you haven't seen the movie you have no idea what you are missing. Just be sure to go on that beach trip BEFORE watching the film, trust me...",10,0,1,10 May 2006
Scream," Lots of Screams Heard
","'Scream', released in 1996, is a great horror film that stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox (now Cox-Arquette), David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Drew Berrymore, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, and others. This film pays homage to many horror film classics that many horror film fanatics never forget. Two sequels proceed. Its release started a new frenzy of horror film fans. It encouraged its audiences to watch the classics that influenced this film. This later became Wes Craven's highest grossing film to date. It received critical acclaim, including a consideration for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (which was overlooked).'Scream' desplicts a group of people in a town that is terrorized by a 'serial killer' whose obsession with horror films goes too far. He, she, or they call the intended victim, alters their voice through a machine, flirts with them, threatens them, and attacks them. The police force's only lead to the killer's identity is a ghost mask. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) seems to be the main target to this killer. Does it connect to the brutal slaying of her mother a year before? Does the killer want revenge, or does the killer want to play copycat? Until the questions are answered, everybody is a suspect. And those who break any of the horror film rules become a target.Director Wes Craven certainly knows the true meaning of horror as he combines these films into this film, yet, fitting wonderfully. He doesn't spoof any of them. Rather, he creates his own horror film that is truly chilling. He occasionally includes non-horror projects that fit the film well, including 'The Ricki Lake Show'. Meanwhile, he adds the occasional teen humor that relates well to that age group. Despite branching off other horror films, his creativity is expressed greatly as in his past films. He takes the typical horror film traditions, mixes them, and makes them his own. He makes every chase scene a roller coaster ride, every suspicious scene suspenseful, and every bloody violent scene intense.Horror film commemorations include 'Friday, the 13th', 'Halloween', 'Carrie', 'The Exorcist', and his own 'Nightmare On Elm Street'. Wes Craven plays a cameo as the janitor 'dressed as' Freddy Krueger. Through these various homage scenes, the main storyline of people being stalked by the killer is never distracted. Meanwhile, he gives this film its own legacy beyond the now-infamous ghost mask. While many other previous blockbuster films have tried paying homage to other films like it, this is the first that has succeeded in high quality.Through this storyline, the actors finely express the crutial points of the film that make it more entertaining. They scream wonderfully, they express their terror wonderfully, and they offer their own sense of humor through the perfect scenes. Campbell expresses the terrorizing theme the highest while stretching Jamie Lee Curtis's legacy as Laurie Strode from 'Halloween'. Cox and Arquette offer the sense of humor the most as an annoying news reporter and a police officer. The actor or actors who play the killer or the killers offer their terrorizing moments greatly that make their character or characters more chilling.'Scream' begins an unforgattable fine trilogy that will hold its position in film history for a long time. Those interested in this trilogy must watch this edition first. Otherwise, they will not understand the storyline. This will surely continue pleasing its audiences as it has since its release.",8,0,1,25 July 2006
Halloween," The SHAPE of things to come
","What is it that is so terrifying about Michael Myers? Is it the blank white mask, the black bottomless eyes, the relentless killings? Or is it something more...Pure Evil.Considering myself a horror film aficionado, I always try to think of what makes a classic horror film like John Carpenter's Halloween Movie so mind bogglingly (think I just made up a word there...) scary. I think it is the simplicity of it all that does it for me.There is not much in the way of blood, guts or gore in Halloween, but you are terrified of Michael none the less. The sight (or even the threat of the sight) of Michael brings chills down your spine. The musical score in and of itself was genius. Not to mention the opening scenes where you see the world through the eyes of a maniacal six year old killer on the night he begins his reign of terror.For Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), this night begins his lifelong obsession with Michael Myers. What was it he said? I'll paraphrase: ' I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven trying to make sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure evil.' He should have tried harder...And what about poor little Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) minding her own business just going to school and babysitting. She had no clue what she was in for. Her friends Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Annie (Nancy Kyes) thought they would have a fun night only to find that Michael has other plans for them.It's easy to see why Michael is obsessed with the town of Haddonfield. After all, this is where he began all those years ago by killing his sister on Halloween night. But why is Michael so obsessed with Laurie? To find out, you may have to watch a sequel. Greatest Horror Film of All-Time in my eyes. And no other killer comes close too Michael Myers. (Jason Is a honorable Mention) All in all , This is One of the greatest Horror Films of this Century. Just pure Classic. Great camera angels , giving it a more scarier look. A Legend was born in Michael Myers. If you are a fan of horror and you don't own this Movie. You should be ashamed of yourself , And go GET IT.",10,0,1,2 August 2006
Signs," Masterful Low Key Horror!
","It's interesting, I'd always liked this movie a lot, but watching it again after a 3 year layoff I finally see just how extraordinarily well done this is. I've watched a helluva lot of horror movies in the past 3 years, and watching this again I really see how it's on a completely different level from the vast majority of them. When it comes to creating a slow rise in tension and simply inserting the supernatural into the apparently real world 'Signs' has few peers. This relates to a small flaw, perhaps: Once we get to the climax, once we've seen all there is to see, the reality proves a little too mundane. But, the strength of the journey itself more than makes up for this slight anticlimax. This is definitely one of the very best horror movies of the new millennium.I've heard some complain that the film lacks sight of the big picture due to its exclusive emphasis on the central family but I think that's what really makes it work, what really makes it real. After all, who cares about the big picture? We don't experience the world as a city or nation, we do it as individuals. That and it just allows us to really get to know the characters, and for Shyamalan to create full, real characters rather than just having a pack of clichÃ©s in various cities spread out across the nation. (Like you'd see in something like 'Deep Impact', for example.) Phoenix and Gibson are both absolutely great in this film, particularly Phoenix. Gibson's Graham is a little to cold and distant for us to relate to him initially, so we really connect with Phoenix's Merrill first, though I definitely came around to liking Graham as the movie went on. They're both utterly naturalistic, and manage a real severe intensity in the most emotional scenes while still avoiding any histrionics. The two children, Culkin and Breslin, are fine. I'm always leery of children having prominent roles in movies, but Shyamalan largely avoids sentimentalizing them excessively (Morgan is kind of a whiny dork) or earning cheap audience identification. (In the scenes where the kids are in the greatest peril I identified far more with Graham then with the children themselves.) Certainly, this won't be to everyone's taste as it is extremely low key up until the very end. And I don't mean this simply in the sense that it isn't violent or gory; that's true of a lot of modern horror films. The film simply refuses to show you much of anything through out the vast majority of the run time. There's a lot of noise related horror, obviously, and it goes light on the jump scares. (More amazingly, some of these scare tactics were actually surprising. Even after having seen it a couple of time before a few years back a couple of these were slightly surprising.) The film uses a particularly classic setting, the old siege on the farmhouse a la 'Night of the Living Dead'. Again, the primary siege is just so impressive because it manages real intensity despite the fact that they show you virtually nothing. The true climax is less effective, but it's still fine and is necessary from a thematic standpoint. Many people have complained about the 'twist' in this film. I've got some news for you: This movie doesn't have a twist. Morons.In the end, however, it may be the human element that really makes this movie standout. It's just a very tragic portrait of a family that has largely fallen apart. I'll admit it, it probably goes a little to far a couple of times, but it also manages a few genuinely moving scenes, which more than compensates. (Particularly note the great scene of Graham and Merrill discussing fate late one night, and Merrill's confronting Graham after the invasion night and so on.) As I always say, I don't really insist that my movies have realistic or likable characters, but the very best ones usually do. And 'Signs' has got that. Furthermore, Shyamalan's dialogue is generally leaps and bounds beyond what you usually see in a horror film, and it's also really quite funny much of the time.I've heard a lot of morons complain that the aliens here don't behave in a realistic fashion. I had a long-winded rant worked out in my mind, but these people aren't gonna be convinced by that, or anything, as a matter of fact, so I'll just keep it simple: It's absurd to claim that the aliens in this behave in an unrealistic fashion because we, the viewer, don't know anything about them. There are an infinite number of potential explanations for why they act as they do, and 0 reasons to believe they would behave any other way. Any supposed logic you may have come up with relating to the aliens is irrelevant, because they are wholly of and within the movie. And perhaps more to the point, this comes with the territory. Complaining about the aliens in this film is like complaining about how hardly anybody has any guns in a contemporary martial-arts film.Yes this is a great film. Definitely Shyamalan's best in my mind, as of this moment.",8,1,2,30 June 2006
Final Destination," Fly the friendly skies..
","If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another 'guy with a hook' campfire story. Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part. Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites. These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.The premise: those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list. This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife. There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.The craftsmanship here is excellent. The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing. We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters. We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements. No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences. And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight. The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time. Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film. A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however. The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.The premise is, of course, self-destructive. Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again. It doesn't end until they die. This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive 'tag-you're-dead' quality of the plot. It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre. Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains. It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across.",9,0,2,1 July 2006
