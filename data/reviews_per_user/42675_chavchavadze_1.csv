Hereditary," Not As Good As You Might Expect
","Even before the movie was released, everyone was already talking how amazingly unsettling it was but it actually didn't deserve so much attention. Yes it starts of well and it is quite interesting and chilling for a while, but unfortunately the ending leaves you very disappointed and gives out the feeling as if the creators got tired in the midway and just decided to wrap it up with the easiest and most common horror story ending they could find. It's still alright for this genre though.",6,0,1,20 March 2019
