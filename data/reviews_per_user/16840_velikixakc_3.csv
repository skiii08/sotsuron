Casablanca," Awesome show
","The plot is excellent, the chemistry is palpable, the acting superb, and the dialogue is amazing. I'm so glad I finally watched this classic. It didn't disappoint, and even had some surprising plot twists.",10,4,4,28 April 2019
Gone with the Wind," Two movies, one great, one sad
","I loved the first half and was very frustrated with the second half. It ends up being more of a tragedy than I would have guessed, and all due to the stupid mistakes of the characters. A classic, but I wish I'd only watched the first half.",7,0,2,28 April 2019
Gran Torino," Unfortunately Disappointed
","I wanted to like it, but the acting was too stiff, the plot way too predictable, and it fed off of a lot of shallow sterotypes. I'll admit, I couldn't finish it. I'm sure I'm in the minority, but that's fine. I was bored and disappointed.",6,4,7,28 April 2019
