Blade Runner 2049," It's a love or hate movie
","I really liked the movie, especially compared to the original Blade Runner, which, for me, was just plain boring. This sequel does everything better. Ryan Gosling does a really good, convincing job.
The greatest thing about this movie are probably the pictures. You could frame nearly each shot sind put it in a museum. Such a beautiful cinematografy!
One of the best sequels of all times! (Because it goes its one way)",9,1,8,24 September 2019
Interstellar," Brutally saddening yet wonderful
","The best movies make you feel something. What this movie did to me was crazy. It made me feel love, hate, hope, sadness, all at the same time. A true masterpiece.",10,2,2,20 September 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Loved this bittersweet adventure
","What makes this movie so good is that it is raw, doesn't follows any rules of the conventional movie-storylines and is brutally real.
You aren't supposed to like the characters, you aren't supposed to feel with them, because no one could ever possibly know what a mother who lost her daughter like that feels.I would say you either love or hate this movie. It's something entirely different and unconventional. I loved it for that!",9,0,0,15 April 2020
Nightcrawler," You'll feel sick after this
","...and not in a good way. But that's what this film wants you to feel, and it more than accomplishes that.
I literally have no words for Jake Gyllenhaals performance, i doubt that anyone could have played this role as he did. It's just stunning how well he fits the character.
It also should make everyone think about the way news are made and how we're all have a much too high inclination towards sensationalism. After this, you really question how that does ANY good.
A must watch.",9,2,3,14 June 2019
