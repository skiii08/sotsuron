The Rock," 'The Rock' is rock solid
","*** 1/2Starring: Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris.An easy-going chemist teams up with an aged criminal along with other soldiers to infiltrate Alcatraz Prison (aka The Rock) and stop a madman from launching a nuclear bomb.The movie has great characters filled in an action-packed setting that will never bore you.  The action is intense and the adrenaline is high so you won't be disappointed in this underrated film.",Null,2,2,13 January 2003
Scarface," 'Say 'ello to my leetle friend!'
","*** 1/2Starring: Al Pacino, Steven Bauer, Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio, and Michelle Pfeiffer.The quote up there is probably the most well-known, and best quote I've ever heard.  'Scarface' is about a Cuban and his friend who travel to America and work their way up the drug ring until it practically kills them.  'Scarface' is a beautiful film, great acting, story, and decent direction.  I will say, however, it is extremely violent and Pfeiffer's character is useless.",10,0,1,27 December 2002
Alien 3," Receives too much hate
","** 1/2Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Charles Dutton, and Charles Dance.Ripley and the survivors from 'Aliens' crashes on a planet that holds a prison.  I'm sad to say that everyone who was on the crash died but Ripley. But, Ripley wasn't alone on the crash.  Something followed her on the prison and is killing all the inmates.  I think this movie receives way too much hate from critics.  I didn't like the movie as much as the other two, but really, how can you compare with the other two?  There aren't many 3rd films that are better than both the others, but you can't judge it by that. Overall a decent film, not as good as the others but who cares?",Null,0,2,28 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie is a 'menace' to the series
","**Starring: Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Jake Lloyd, and Natalie Portman.The movie follows at the very beginning of Anakin Skywalker's life.  Most probably know of Anakin as 'Darth Vader'.  The movie also focuses on the early life of Obi Wan Kanobe (I don't know how to spell HIS name).  We are also introduced to some new characters.  Darth Maul is pretty much the villain like Vader.  Jar-Jar Binks is their to attract little kids and annoy the rest.  Liam Neeson's character (do NOT get me started with his name) is Obi's trainer.The movie doesn't have the excitement it should be.  Darth Maul makes a great villain, and Jar-Jar was completely unnecassery.",Null,2,4,22 May 2003
Ali," Ali! Ali! Ali!

I am saying that he deserved a nomination, but with the other contendors I don't think he should've won.  'Ali' is one of those films that you remember how well an actor did.  I never expected Smith to do such a good job as Ali.  I will say one thing, though, Voight did NOT deserve a nomination.  Of anyone, Mario van Peebles or Jamie Foxx should've gotten a nod.",Null,0,1,28 December 2002

Minority Report," I'm in the 'minority' who doesn't consider this a masterpiece.

But soon enough, Cruise finds himself on the run when he finds out that in the future he will commit a murder.  He must prove his innocence while attempting to actually find who he was going to kill.The movie is a masterpiece in special effects.  That's it.

Melvin likes the woman, but the woman doesn't like him the way Melvin likes her.  Kinnear is Melvin's gay roommate, who ends up falling for the waitress.

The team that he coaches makes a bet that if they win the championship, then he must try out for pro baseball.  Well guess what happens?  Yep, you guessed it. I can't exactly tell you the rest, but you'll love it.The film has a lot of heart that keeps this movie going and going.  Quaid portrays a wonderful performance as Jimmy Morris.  Everyone else is perfect, and his is definitely on the top 10 of 2002.  It's Oscar material all the way and deserves whatever it gets.What's also good about this is that it can be a great movie with no bad language or anything.  That's a sign of great writing.Highly recommended to everyone, but very highly recommended to families.",Null,10,13,13 January 2003
Happy Gilmore," 'Happy' times

Sure there is a very fine line between Golf and Hockey, but Happy is good at it.  Happy also needs to win a golf tournament in order to help pay for a debt (or something) that his Grandma needs.

They go and find the one who originally found it, a prisoner (Brendan Fraser).  When they get to Hamunaptra, they unlock a 3000 year old mummy, who they don't know (until later) is the bringer of death.

Insomnia," Nearly made me fall asleep, then woke me right up.
","** 1/2Starring: Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank.Insomnia is a remake of the 1998 movie of the same title starring Stellan Skarsgard.  This one stars Al Pacino as a cop who makes a huge mistake and lies about it.  That is where he gets his insomnia.  I'm not allowed to tell you *how* he gets his insomnia, but I am allowed to say that he's blackmailed.  Blackmailed by a killer.  You want to know who that is, well it's Robin Williams.  Williams is making a trilogy of dark series (Other two are Death to Smoochy, and the upcoming One-hour photo) rather than staying with his normal comedic attitude.  Hilary Swank is another cop from Alaska who learns Pacino's dark secret.  The only reason I say why I almost fell asleep is because there is no tension whatsoever.  I was expecting to see tension galore, but I rather got a slow-paced film.  The ending really caught my attention.  I was wide awake for that.  Also, the story could've been a tad bit better, I say the same for the 1998 version.  The movie is smart and intelligent, and, actually, I recommend it.",Null,0,0,5 August 2002
The Terminator," A fresh and original idea taken to a higher level
","*** 1/2Starring:  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn.What could be a better idea for a movie than of this?  Here's the plot: In the deep future,a man (John Connor) is stopping the war with the machines. Back in 1984, he wasn't born yet.  SO the machines send a Terminator back in time to 1984 to kill the mother of Connor so he will never be born.  But, another man from the future was sent to 1984 to protect the mother, Sarah Connor.  Is that not a fresh and original idea or what?  That's what makes this movie so good (plus the excellent action and acting).  The action is mesmerizing.  It got me laughing as much as it did in the movie.  Seeing a huge machine in Arnold Schwarzenegger's body being hit by hundreds of bullets made me laugh and made me serious.  I highly recommend this movie. If you see this movie, I suggest you see the sequel, Terminator 2: Judgement Day.",Null,0,0,4 August 2002

Because this was just more fun.  I can't say that before I've seen this I have ever seen a person spit white stuff (no, perverts, it's not what you think).  This movie has a scary kind of feel to it, that made an impression on scary movies (like 'Halloween').  I do think that this is better than Aliens.  Better by a landslide?  No way.  Better by a little bit?  Exactly.",Null,0,1,28 December 2002

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An excellent adaption of Tolkien's novel.
","****
What works about Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, is that the entire movie is depicted so much greater than of Tolkien's novel.  The setting was beautiful and unbelievable.  The fight sequences, and primarily the CGI, are far better than I had expected.  The movie follows Elijah Wood and his friends who are followed by a great force that wants what he has. He possesses an all-powerful ring that was given to him and is needed by the forces.  He must destroy the ring before the force destroys him and his friends.  the movie is very well brought and very surprising as of the acting skills.  the cast was perfect for their performances.  I was especially surprised by the performance of Viggo Mortenson.  I have seen him in many roles but this one is his best.  The fight sequences are quite intense and powerful.  It had me awake by the somewhat slow times in the movie.  Overall the movie is highly recommended to everyone, and especially of those who have read Tolkien's trilogy.",Null,0,0,2 August 2002

After the hole is drilled, they must put a giant bomb to blow the asteroid in two; therefore, the two asteroids miss the earth completely.Now the flaws are really just one.  But it's a big one.  Ok, say the asteroid the size of Texas was blown up, but what would happen if it blew off an asteroid the size of Dallas? Austin? San Antonio? They would all blow up part, if not all of earth.It's a fun but flawed movie, and you also must have the tolerance of sitting through a love story (Ben Affleck IS in it).

The crew must find a way to get out the planet in one piece (many of them find that a tough task).There were some great times, but the scares run very dry.  And some of the characters bothered me.  For instance, Vin Diesel is portrayed as a good guy, but he is really a murderer.

The best part of his day is masterbating in the shower. He and his wife have no relationship, and his daughter hates him.  His life is soon enough brought back when his daughter's flirtatious friend brings back his boring life.The movie, in my opinion, is quite overrated.  It's a twisted dark comedy that provides some laughs, but is far more weird than it is good.  Spacey provides a great performance, but it gets distracted by his odd character. So I leave my review with a four question quiz.1. Is this the weirdest movie I have ever seen? No. 2. Is it one hell of a weird movie? Yes. 3. Is it a good movie? Mostly 4. Do I recommend this?

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," An unbelievable sequel to a great movie.
","*** 1/2Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick, Linda Hamilton, and Joe Morton.There are hardly any movies that can beat the movie before it.   Terminator 2 suceeds.  What was fresh about the first film is that their idea for a film was so original that it suceeds majorly.  How can any movie beat an idea like that?  You come up with a slightly different idea and add new characters.  The movie is practically non-stop action full of smart settings and great ideas for 'how the characters are going to escape.'  The movie is about the Terminator (who is suddenly now a good guy) who must *protect* John Connor from an unstoppable liquid-metal killing machine.  Arnold's back and he is much better than ever.  Furlong was good as John Connor at age 10 (weird, he sounds 10, he was really 14).  Robert Patrick is so cool as the villain I can't decide if he or Arnold from the last one is better. Hamilton reprises her role as Connor's mother and she's good here.  I am very surprised of how underused Morton's character is.  he could at better than anyone on the cast and he was their for about 15 minutes.  I have to say that when he was dying, that was the best acting I've ever seen. Overall I highly recommend this excellent movie.  If you love action, you'll love this.",Null,1,1,4 August 2002

Why the heck would you rather have a huge love story than an interesting war movie?  I guess I have to ask Michael Bay.  The movie is bad.  Really bad.  Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale ruined this movie.  The only reason Josh Hartnett didn't is because every movie Affleck is in is a love story.  And love stories and war movies can't mix.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. was probably the best part in the movie, portraying Dorie Miller.  Another saving grace is the action sequences.  That, and Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s presence was good.

The movie is a real excellent war film that shows how war is really like, instead of other films (Windtalkers!Windtalkers!) I also have to note that the first 30 minutes were the most realistic time probably ever in a movie.",Null,0,1,18 September 2002

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'Towers' over the competition
","****Starring: Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortenson, Ian McKellan, and Sean Astin.This film takes off where 'Felloewship' left off.  This time, they aren't a fellowship.  It seems that the fellowship broke off into little groups. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), the holder of the ring, and Sam (Sean Astin) set off to Mordor to destroy the ring.  On their way, they find an unlikely guide, Gollum.  Gollum suffers from a split-personality way, having one side a vicous beast and the other a nicer beast. Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) set out to find Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd).  When we last saw Gandalf (Ian McKellan), we had thought that he fell to a death.  But he ends up being alive afterall.  Saruman (Christopher Lee) makes an army of orcs to kill everyone and retrieve the ring.The film is excellent on many ways, filling every question with an answer, every battle with a great end, and every character has its goods.  I will also note that the final battle is brilliant.",10,0,0,20 December 2002

Crimson Tide is an example of intelligence, and now so is K-19.  The movie is about a possibly doomed submarine, controlled by the captain (Harrison Ford) who strangely enough for part of the film is presented as a bad guy.  But his character is really trying to save his crew.  Liam Neeson is the former captain who is presented as the good guy is also just trying to save his fellow crew's lives.  The movie depicts the sad events of the brave heroes who had to undergo radiation while fixing the ship.  Though, the movie is quite flawed and a little slow-paced, the movie should be up for the Best Picture this year.",9,0,0,2 August 2002

Doc is stuck back in 1885, the Old West, and Marty goes back to the past to save him, before he gets stuck in the Old West. The movie is very funny and takes some good old jokes from the first two, and make them a little better.  Of course, you have Biff (I guess I should say Buford) in maneur.  The movie's franchise has plenty of hot gas to have made some more sequels, but the ending makes sure that it will never happen again.  This franchise is just like the Ghostbusters franchise, you want more of them, but you just don't get them (something that the Friday the 13th series just shouldn't get).

If you thought the most highly anticipated sequel of the summer is rather a dud.  It really doesn't have any funny parts and is mildly tense.  I don't know about you, but Lara Flynn Boyle is very sexy, but she isn't as good of a villain as Vincent D'Onforio.  The movie, if you don't know what its about yet, is about an evil alien who wants something that only K know where it is.  Big problem, K was neuralized.

When the trick happens, hell breaks loose and she shows the senior class her telekinetic powers.In my opinion, they move from a drama to a horror movie way too fast. I mean the telekinetic scene was great, but it moved too fast.  For instance, it shows how Tommy Ross (Carrie's date) starts to like her.  And then they end him, which was a bad idea.Another thing that moved too fast was the teacher.  First she seems angered when Carrie gets blood on her, then it shows her laughing hysterically.

Such as something involving a television screen.  I have never heard an audience scream so loud to jump scenes.  The movie starts a little slow but then gets quickly to the point after the word above.  The film has quite some hilarious moments to it, such as when Gibson and Phoenix are trying to find a 'culprit' and the words they are saying are so funny.  The ending is a different ballgame.

The opening starts with an explosion in an elevator shaft trapping 12 or so people alive.  If the mad bomber doesn't get 3 million dollars he blows the elevator.  Keanu Reeves and Jeff Daniels foil the mad bomber's (Dennis Hopper) plan but don't get away with him.  The next day, the bomber put a bomb on a bus that if it reaches 50 mph, the bomb is activated, and if it goes under 50 mph, it explodes.  The acting is generally perfect for all their characters, especially those on the bus.  Many people spit out very funny lines even when the event is bad. (Examples: 'Bob, what button did you push?)  That was funny.  The movie is also very smart showing what the good guy knows and the bad guy doesn't, vice verca.  The demise of the bomber is so smart and so funny, I just started to laugh.

I seriously can't see how critics think John Woo is a good director, because he isn't.  The movie is about a hoakie war guy who has to protect a Navajo Indian also known as a Windtalker.  The movie SHOULD be about the Navajo Indians and their duty. But it IS about Nicholas Cage's jerk character.  This movie is so full of flaws it will make your head explode.  Here are a few:  (SPOILERS) 1. Nicholas Cage had a grenade blown up right next to him, yet he has a slightly bad hearing problem and a wobbly leg.  He should be blown to bits and pieces.  2.  Cage seems to be very lucky considering he hardly gets hit and hits about a million Japanese.  3.  Cage was shot in the leg twice and is still able to carry Adam Beach many yards.  4.  There are no such things as Japanese samurais in the Japanese Army.  Think about it, big men with AK-47s, a skinny guy with a sword.  Who's going to win.

The mosquito has been over 65 million years old and contains dinosaur DNA.  So what should they do with that????  Make a dinosaur park.  When a group of people actually arrive, the dinosaurs go haywire and all hell breaks loose.  The movie is extremely creative and intelligent, and doesn't keep some scenes missing something, there's always something there that keeps your eyes watching the movie.",Null,1,2,17 September 2002
Dodgeball," Don't 'dodge' this one
","*** 1/2The 'Average Joe Gym,' owned by Peter La Fleur, is about to be taken over by the enormous Globo-Gym.  His only chance to get it back is by retrieving $50,000.  Coincidentally, a dodgeball tournament is happening in Las Vegas where the grand prize is 50k.  Peter and his friends must compete and win this tournament to keep their gym, but of course not without White Goodman, the owner of Globo-Gym, in the same tournament.I'm just gonna say this: Ben Stiller makes this movie. Given that their is a great supporting cast, Stiller steals every scene.  Besides that this movie is hysterical.  Along with 'Anchorman' this is the second 'stupid' comedy of the summer, and I loved them both.  Just about all the jokes work perfectly.Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,21 August 2004
