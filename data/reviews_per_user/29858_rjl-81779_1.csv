First Man," Character Study
","I thought it was an excellent portrayal of an introverted engineer in the US space program that had difficult time sharing his feelings under extreme pressures and circumstances. I could relate to the friction between job and family, however, his stage was at set at a much higher level. You begin to understand the stress on the family and especially his wife. Having lived during this period, you only saw the public face of the person and the US space program. This film you come away with a greater appreciation of the man, his family and the space program.",9,2,10,12 October 2018
