Black Swan," Clothed Erotica is Damn Unsexy
","Black Swan is the story of Nina Sayars (Natalie Portman) a professional ballerina struggling to come of age when she fulfils her lifelong dream of landing the lead part of her company's latest production, Swan Lake. The thrill of this accomplishment is tarnished by the fact that she is unable to deal with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey), questionably ethical director (Vincent Cassel), taking over the throne of the former star lead (Winona Ryder) and competing with free spirited newcomer (Mila Kunis).Director Darren Aronofsky displays the story on the back of Portman's character that is originally plain and innocent, allowing the viewer to observe firsthand the pain and effort she endures to obtain the role, and the impressive skill of the performances that result. On top of this, the viewer experiences Nina's psychological breakdown, her bulimia, gross obsessions, paranoid hallucinations and out of body experiences. Kudos for Portman for learning the ballet moves, but I have seen her act better than this, the innocence and naivety was overplayed for a character who has survived a cutthroat dance company. The movie has a pretty basic premise and therefore the build up doesn't take very long. The first two acts rely on the gratuity of Nina's obsessions and her quite unerotic exploration of her sexuality (Wild Things this ain't!). Apart from a few 'Am I crazy or not' moments, the actual substance of the first two thirds of the movie is quite dry and ridiculous which is a bit disappointing. However when all seems gone with this movie, it packs a real punch for the final act. Blending the breakdown of Nina's psychosis with her first on stage performance is brilliant and well worth the wait.I left this film feeling that it was made for the ending and the blank first two acts were filled in on the way. It tries to shock you for entertainment with gross obsessions, but results in being gratuitous. And clothed-erotica is damn unsexy and ridiculous and insults the viewer. Unsure if it is worth the Oscar buzz, but who knows with the best quality movies coming out these days being CG cartoons.",7,2,4,23 January 2011
Avatar," More a great experience than a great movie...
","This movie is a tough one to rate. Avatar without a doubt is a new experience in the movie theater. I left this movie pretty confused on how I felt about it that it has taken me a couple of days to break it down and figure it out.Avatar impresses right from the start with the amazing use of the 3D technology. Never before has movie come across so visually precise. This really heightened the movie experience for me, and it's safe to say that the 3D technology is here to stay. Director's will be pushing studios for its use to get extra mileage out of their films for years to come.Along with the amazing use of 3D imagery is the near perfect CGI implemented into the film. It's impossible to fault any detail created by Cameron's whiz-bang movie making machines and makes the Star Wars prequels look like Space Invaders.With his new tools Cameron has been able to create the fascinating world of Pandora. This is a world that has been allowed to evolve biologically in comparison to Earth that has been evolving technologically. The Na'vi, Pandora's intelligent tall blue human/monkey/lizard species, live in their habitat with a strong philosophy in keeping the natural balance of life and giving nature the respect it truly deserves. Quite inspiring and mind blowing stuff, and the vast amounts of creativity involved in creating Pandora's landscapes, flora and fauna is second to none. The world of Pandora one its own is a sheer work of art and deserves much praise.What does distract from Pandora is the movie's poor script. The Avatar concept is tricky at best, very frustrating to fathom as the movie goes on and its use to try and boost a very generic epic plot was at times a bit condescending. The dialogue is tiresome and you will later be wishing that Cameron had cut out more of the human scenes to get to the wildlife scenes, where everything including the acting is so much better. If the screen writing had the same amount of attention to detail that the world of Pandora had, this movie could have been one of the best of all time.See this film for the visual feast of Pandora, it's the real point of all this, it's spectacular and you will not regret forking over the hard earned. Best to see this movie wide awake to as it is lengthy and the plot and dialogue may distract you from paying attention to the real good stuff. I hope this isn't the only movie I get to see this world, it's an exciting place to experience. Cameron has created something truly incredible, a breakthrough in movie technology, I just hope that screen writing and character development continues to get the respect required to make truly great movies.",7,3,10,19 December 2009
