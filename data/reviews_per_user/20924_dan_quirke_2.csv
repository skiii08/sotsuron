Changeling," An Incredible and breath-taking film
","This film completely blew me away, it had a really impact upon me. it left the cinema feeling really shocked by what i had seen, in a good way though. This film really involves your emotions, you are left feeling heart-broken, frustrated, but also hopeful, as this amazing depiction of the true story of Christine Collins is brought to life on screen The pacing of the film was excellent, it may have felt long, but you it ended exactly when it should have done, fully conveying the emotional depth the story required. They casting was also excellent, every character was multi-dimensional and served their own purpose.However, what really made this film truly special was Angelina Jolie's phenomenal performance as Christine Collins. I have never seen such amazing acting on screen. Her portrayal was more than heart-wrenching, and some of the scenes really gave me chills. Her commitment t the role really showed, and you could tell his was a part she was passionate about. I really is an Oscar worthy performance and if she doesn't win this year, i'll eat my hat! The directing was also incredible, the way Eastwood managed to build the tension and create a hugely 'on-edge' atmosphere was genius, the hanging scene is the perfect example of this, as is the scene when Christine Collins visits her son's 'killer'. Also the story was extremely true to the actual events, they even dressed her the same as is seen in an old photo of Miss Collins. it is detail and care like this which makes it one of the most fascinating and tragic films of the year.Finally i cannot overstress Angelina's awesome performance. This film is truly a masterpiece. Buy it, Rent it, WHATEVER, just watch it! watch it! watch it!",10,6,9,7 February 2009
Wanted," Mind-Blowingly Awesome
","OK, to truly appreciate this film you have to forget all your usual action film 'rules', clich√©s and the general 'do's' and 'dont's', because Wanted literally throws this all out the windows, picks it up again, shakes it around and slow-motion shoots the rules right in the face, and does whatever looks cool! However this works. In some weird way, it manages to pull off all the over-the-top action, stunts and shooting because it looks amazing on screen and completely fits with the comic book style. I left the cinema literally wanting to be an assassin.Apart from the spectacular action, there is also so much humour, which made me literally laugh out loud, for example his hilarious boss, Fox's reactions to Wesley, and Wesley's general nervous, awkwardness when faced which such intimidating people. James Macavoy was perfect for this role, you completely buy this character and you really want him to succeed. People in the cinema were literally clapping when he smacks the keyboard across his friend's face, spelling the word 'fuck you' in the air from flying keys, the 'u' being made up from a tooth! Angelina Jolie was also painfully cool, everyone gasped when she first appeared on screen. Her action scenes make her even more hotter as she effortlessly drives a car whilst laying on the bonnet, shooting bad guys, whilst dodging passing traffic, and her chemistry with James was hilarious from start to finish. Morgan Freeman, is as usual fantastic, only enhancing the quality of this film.The story is generally gripping, filled with twists and turns, leaving you to wonder how it all will end out. And the ending is certainly no let down allowing you to leave the cinema feeling completely satisfied and wanting more. The quirkiness and absurdity of this film makes it completely different from all your other action films as it really is a real fun watch. Wanted is definitely the best action film of the year, and one of the most original i've seen for a long time!",9,2,8,7 February 2009
