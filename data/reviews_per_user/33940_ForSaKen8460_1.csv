Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious
","Borat is the most hilarious I have seen in some time, the comedy in the movie is brilliant, the character borat him self is a good stereotype of a foreigner and the stupidity of the American people in the movie makes it even better, Its movies like this one that makes you want to watch it over and over and over again. This movie can't possibly get old in anyway. Its a must buyer as well, if you like Jackass, Monty Python, or anything remotely familiar in any way then you HAVE to see this movie. unlike some films, Borat is not slow paced... I would say it is a pretty fast pace movie, every second of the movie keeps you laughing. This movie will either offend you or you will love it to death.-Austi n Carswel l",10,1,18,11 January 2007
