The Blair Witch Project," Wasn't scary, Wasn't original, Surely wasn't worth my time
","Just so you all know, I only saw this foreseeably trashy flick because my old friends from Carmel forced me to. Its just another sad product from the amateur video camera trashcan, on the same level as Cops, The Real World, America's (un)Funniest Home Videos, and When Animals Attack. To call this film a 'mockumentary' is being generous, since it doesnt even resemble a fake documentary. I thought Faces of Death looked more realistic. I don't really blame the filmmakers (forgive the misnomer), after all, they were just trying to find the same instant success that John Carpenter did back in 1978 when he made Halloween on a similar shoestring budget. And they may very well have, but it doesn't excuse the utter senselessness that viewers are forced to endure for 87 minutes.Like most video programs which feature footchases, this movie has numerous dizzying scenes, with the camera spinning so fast that cinemagoers easily become nauseous. Even I, a veteran of numerous rollercoasters and spinning amusement park rides wanted to honk after the first 15 minutes. Thats about as exciting as it gets, the rest is a silly bore. I was laughing during many of the so called 'scary scenes,' the screaming, crying, shaking characters, it was all a comical farce.This movie supposedly cost $28,000 to produce, and thats a relief. To have wasted any more money to produce such a cheap sham would be criminal. I can't wait to see how the sequel does!",Null,1,3,12 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the barrel's been scraped so many times it should have holes by now
","I liked the first star wars movie, and it was fine that Lucas felt the story should be told in two films. In fact, the second was even better in my opinion, far more intelligent and 'realistic' from a thematic standpoint (had a terrific climax and denouement, but not the cliched 'happy ending'). The third was geared too much for the series' juvenile audience, indicating the producer's excessive commercial emphasis. Now this one has been taken a step further, with a child actually being the star of the movie! As if that wasn't bad enough, we've got awful (yes, awful!) special effects; fake lightening, easily recognized computer animation, and electric springboards, which do not enhance the feature one iota. As for the story, it seems that Lucas spent years planning the technical aspects of the film and left the script for the last few days. Anakin Skywalker born of an immaculate conception???? (didn't know he was Jesus) Obi Wan Kenobi had a braided longlock??? A 20 minute replay of Ben Hur with Jabba the Hut in place of Pontius Pilate??? Even with that aside, why did Lucas have to steal ideas from star trek, subsituting boring political and bureaucracy nonsense for the high-powered action scenes which made the original films so famous? The sad fact is, George Lucas's entire career (which has netted him over 2 billion dollars, the largest amount for anyone in hollywood) is based on one film. The product tie-ins: toys, beverage glasses, t-shirts, breakfast cereals, reruns, video tapes, video games,...... have made him so wealthy that it doesn't pay for him not to produce an endless series of sequels, no matter how ridiculous they are.",Null,0,1,6 August 2000
Erin Brockovich," Dubious real-life situation lends itself poorly to the big screen
","Let's say for a moment that Pacific Gas and Electric actually poisoned a community's water supply to 'enhance shareholder value.' Is there really anything inspirational about a film that chronicles such an event? I would join the chorus of just persons demanding that each victim receive a large monetary sum in addition to effective medical treatment, but not jump for joy at a film exploiting the tragedy. Especially when the star of the film is...Julia Roberts??? Her grossly irritating performance was enough to roil even Ms. Brockovich herself, and I can see why. Yet plenty of cinemagoers appreciate that level of acting, and if you're among them, then this will certainly tickle your fancy. Keep in mind, however, that numerous independent reports have refuted Ms. Brockovich's claims of environmental toxicity as total bogus. Yet she received a larger multimillion dollar settlement from PG&E than did a number of the supposedly afflicted litigants. There is no shortage of corporate villains in the USA who deserve to be chastised, but it seems this film furthered the blame of the wrong people.",Null,5,10,14 January 2003
The English Patient," Yet Another Boring Experiment in Pseudointellectualism
","To be brief (unlike the movie) the english patient was hollow and uninteresting. The people who rave about it are just flattering themselves by pretending to be fine arts aficionados. Besides being too long (160 minutes), english patient is riddled with chronological inaccuracies (which is fine, but then why did the writers limit themselves with historical constraints if they weren't going to adhere to them?) and story gaps (even the most charlatan of filmgoers wouldn't dare claim to have understood most of the plot). Ralph Fiennes is not a talented actor, even his Schindler's List performance was lacking, but he somehow blends into this mediocre film. And the love scenes?? Please. Aside from a few cheap beaver shots of Kristin Scott Thomas, they were just recast versions of The Young and the Restless. I never tell people not to see a movie, no matter how bad it is, but don't be surprised if you find yourself checking your watch every two minutes when viewing this one.",Null,3,5,26 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Knew it would be terrible
","Thats why I snuck into the theatre to see it (for only the third time in my life). I just couldn't rationalize contributing any further to Lucas's fat purse which he obviously loves far more than his long-gone artistic achievements. Even after getting in for free, I still left well before the ending--having done so only once previously. Now I understand that you can't 'eat principles', but with over a billion dollars earned from his earlier films, it doesn't appear that our friend George is starving. The story is only marginally better than Phantom Menace's, however little that is saying, and nearly all of the actors deliver extremely weak performances. Christopher Lee, a notable exception, still shouldve turned this one down. His 'Count Dooku' role was misconceived and seemed designed solely for the purpose of including a well-respected, Alec Guinness-like British star. Even more disturbing, despite the urgings of fans far more devoted than I, Lucas still hasn't transferred the directorial and screenwriting reins to more capable professionals (as he had the one-time good sense to do in Empire Strikes Back) and concentrate on what he knows: storywriting and props. So we're stuck with another messy, thrown-together flick whose sole purpose is to inflate its creator's already enormous bank account.",Null,0,0,13 June 2002
American Pie," Pale Ale
","Well, in this world of mimicry, its no surprise that movie producers have much less room for innovation than for duplication. American Pie is yet another example of this. After the suprise hit 'Theres something about Mary' was released last year, Universal just had to get in on the action. So they made a film with a similar theme, reduced the target audience age by about 10 years, and 'American Pie' was born. Only now we have a film which is so gross, so tasteless, and so immature that it makes Mary look like a G rated family adventure. If you think the hair gel scene in Something about Mary was pushing it, check out the expectoration-beer scene in this movie.
I've always been a huge fan of the 1980s comedy skin flicks like Porky's, and don't really mind gross humor (I loved Trainspotting) as long as its got something good to balance it. But all this film has is annoying teens drinking, reading porn, and finding new ways to beat a proverbial dead horse (don't even consider that a pun) with a nonsensical apple pie scene that has already been made notorious from TV advertisements. Sure there are a few attempts to make this film seem original and innocuous, like a choir subplot and Eugene Levy's fatherly concern (He happens to be a likeable guy), but nearly every scene in this movie revolves around boringly crude bodily function humor.Im sure this movie will do well when released on video, its an ideal teen slumber party feature, but its a far cry from its much handier 80s progenitors. If Cinemax ever decided to have an adult TGIF, this would surely be their focal point. After all, its merely an R rated version of 'Boy Meets World.'",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
The Killing Fields," A gripping and saddening film, despite its numerousflaws
","This film has many strengths. And a few weaknesses. Its powerful true story is one of the most haunting of the twentieth century, the systematic torture and genocide of 2 million people from the Cambodian population of 7 million during 1975-79 by a radical communist regime, the Khmer Rouge ('Red Cambodia'). The film depicts, with near perfect accuracy, the psychopathic guerillas who menacingly enslave and eradicate their countrymen while slapping and screaming. The graphic display of bloody bodies which litter the streets and fields, while very upsetting, adds to the authentic depiction of the Cambodian Massacre. A viewer is so powerfully convinced by this elegant presentation that he can actually picture himself there, in the heat of terror. No wonder The Killing Fields won an Oscar for best cinematography! As for the actors, I am among the minority of viewers who was not impressed by the main players. Sam Waterson portrayed the brash Sydney Schanberg with an annoyingly pompous attitude. John Malkovitch, though critically acclaimed for his role as Al Rockoff, didnt really add more than a few minutes of amusement. Julian Sands, who is a fine actor and probably the best of the Caucasian actors in this film, was too despondent to give a really inspiring performance, but that was the tone of the film, so he really isn't to blame. Haing Ngor, a real life Cambodian survivor, deserved his best supporting actor oscar for such a focused portrayal of Dith Pran, but even he came across as bland at times. Some of the Southeast Asian actors, while unknown to the western world (and probably the eastern world too) were so authentic and powerful that one wonders if they were really Khmer soldiers and peasants in real life. The scene where Phat, an educated landowner turned Khmer Rouge revolutionary, explains to Dith Pran how he sacrificed everything for the Khmer Rouge, only to be distrusted by them to the point where his life is in danger, was one of the most brilliant in the film. Another amazing scene was during the first hour of the film, when the American Embassy in Phnom Penh is evacuated by US Marine helicopters to Mike Oldfield's very bizzare (though appropriate) musical theme.I object to the left wing political views of this film. Repeated references were made to the US bombings of Cambodia and Vietnam, and President Nixon is even shown giving an address on the 'Nixon doctrine,' as if the US was to blame for the Cambodian Massacre. It was not. America made some serious policy errors when intervening in the Vietnam and Cambodian wars, but they had nothing to do with the radical communist principles which have killed over 100 million in Europe and Asia during the past 80 years. And even more insulting, Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge chief who led the slaughter of his own people is never even mentioned in this film. Sydney Schanberg, when asked in the film by reporters if he and other journalists were to blame for underestimating the brutality of the Khmer Rouge, answers 'maybe what we underestimated was the paranoia that 7 billion dollars worth of bombs could cause' another shift in blame from Pol Pot and his murderous communist regime. And finally, the last major flaw in this film was the cheesy ending, where Sydney and Pran are reunited to John Lennon's song 'Imagine.' Many critics have denounced that as a significant mistake by Roland Joffe. However, I did enjoy this film and hope that viewers who havent seen it yet but read this take heed, and try to see the facts through the mild distortions.",Null,1,4,16 June 1999
Heartbreak Ridge," Standard Eastwood TBS fare
","As more than a few observers have noted, USMC Recon is a creme de la creme fighting unit, on par with any ultra-selective military branch you can imagine. They simply do not accept goofballs. Tom Villard, Boyd Gaines, and Mario Van Peebles may be fitting choices for Porky's or One Crazy Summer, but certainly not a hardcore combat picture. Still, the gravest technical errors can be overlooked if brilliant storywriting or performances warrant doing so, but is either evident here? Clint deserves credit for amusing audiences as the rock-hard drill instructor, demonstrated by his 'I've drank more beer, pi**ed more blood, and banged more qui** than all you numb nuts put together' tirade. His acting and directing methods, however, tend not to change much from film to film. I remember watching Heartbreak Ridge on TV and confusing its slow-moving battle footage with that of The Eiger Sanction, while having dreaded flashbacks, in the wake of the obligatory Eastwood hick-town bar scene, of Every Which Way But Loose.",Null,0,2,1 December 2002
In the Name of the Father," A Very Sharp Film
","What a clever film this was. Quite modest yet remarkably entertaining. Instead of blaring political bias, viewers are treated to a compassionate human drama without the preachings and irritating banter of most other 'social dramas' (Dog Day Afternoon, All the President's Men, Norma Rae). It's shameful that this film didn't receive at least two academy awards, despite it having been nominated for 7. Now considering that this was the same year that Schindler's List and The Piano, two outstanding dramas, were released, it isnt surprising nor unreasonable that they beat In the Name of the Father for many of the awards.The acting in this film is terrific. Lewis is low key and quite effective as the petty Irish thief Gerry Conlon. Pete Postlethwaite is spectacular as Gerry's father Guiseppe (certainly better than oscar winner tommy lee jones was in the fugitive). Emma Thompson's portrayal of attorney Gareth Pierce received much acclaim, and properly so. Beatie Edney, who had a small part as a wrongfully accused British teenage hippie, was so enamoring that its a wonder we don't see more of her.Of course much of this film is exagerrated and perhaps fabricated for the purposes of entertainment (as all movies which are 'based on a true story' tend to be) but it's so finely done that it doesn't seem to matter. Some terrific scenes include the beginning, when Gerry and his friends are chased by British soldiers after being mistaken for IRA snipers, the trial in London, the prison scenes (which expose the loneliness and honesty of the characters rather than the crude violence and gang rapes of so many other pathetic prison movies), and of course the powerful ending, where the marvelous dramatic talents of all the actors are evinced in a final crescendo. Be sure to see this film if you haven't, it will definitely stir your emotions and renew your faith in the human spirit. And for those who eschew political films, give it a try anyways, the acting and craftiness outweigh the civic themes.",Null,60,70,25 July 1999
Amadeus," Overrated
","F. Murray Abraham is a talented actor, and deserved the oscar for his role in Amadeus, but the movie itself wasn't as special as many in hollywood would like to believe. Tom Hulce gave a disasterously unconvincing performance as Mozart, he shouldve let Animal House remain the only work for which he is known. Jeffrey Jones was actually good as the emperor, but the rest of the virtually unknown cast didn't leave much of an impression. The attempt at recreating post Baroque Vienna was admirable, but the grossly rewritten history was insulting and blasphemous. Who would believe that Mozart spent his last hours writing music with his good buddy Salieri? The scene in Heat where Pacino and DeNiro have coffee together was more realistic! Milos Forman's direction was noble and this film wouldve been much better with a different Mozart, a better supporting cast, and a plausible story.",Null,2,5,19 September 1999
Ghostbusters," Fabulous entertainment
","This was a terrific movie, perfect for fans of John Landis type humor. Reitman really did a superb job here, as did Murray, Ackroyd, and Ramis. The science-fiction parody and hillarious dialogue blow away all these stupid banal pseudocomedies of today, and renew one's faith in intelligent filmmaking. Sure it was silly at times, but most of the movie was a home run. Who could forget the Ghostbusters' first assignment, or when Rick Moranis gives a party for his accounting clients (a truly hillarious scene). Its no surprise that this was one of the top selling movies in history and a total blockbuster during the summer of 1984. I can't imagine anyone not having seen it, but its on comedy central and network television. Great for all ages.",Null,0,0,3 January 2000
Black Hawk Down," Unoriginal depiction of blood-and-guts combat doesn't tell the full story
","Let's face it, Jerry Bruckheimer's films about military life are not known for being accurate or innovative--note Top Gun, Crimson Tide, and of course the syndicated tv show Special Ops Force. Ridley Scott's GI Jane and Gladiator haven't been much better. Hence, Black Hawk Down's saturation with cowboy imagery and gung-ho catchphrases can be expected. What viewers might find disappointing is that all of the lessons taught by the Battle of Mogadishu, most importantly our failure to learn from the past, end up taking a back seat to appropriate but overemphasized gory footage. When General Thomas Montgomery (whose name is not mentioned in the film) is denied by Washington the sufficient resources to enact this mission, does he risk angering the top brass by refusing to accept supervisory responsibility unless his demands are met?? Of course not. Instead, Ranger Task Force Leader General Garrison is ordered to send  troops into harm's way from the safety of an office bunker. Critics of this 'going along to get along' trend also consider it to have seriously undermined our efforts in the Vietnam War. Even if we can forgive that, why does the film neither mention the previous seven missions in Somalia conducted by Garrison nor explain that they were all identical, giving the enemy plenty of insight to our methods? If the writers didn't want to be political or point fingers, maybe they should have just constructed an entirely fictional street battle. Instead, they decidied to present an incomplete picture of what happened on 10/3/93.",Null,0,1,11 November 2002
There's Something About Mary," I Liked It
","This was a funny and refreshing film. So what if the story was stupid and the gross humor (particularly at the beginning) was a bit much. Cameron Diaz was pleasant and funny, and Ben Stiller was likeable too. Chris Elliot, who has had such bad luck with Get a Life and Saturday Night Live (From which he was fired for not being funny enough!!!!) finally gets a break here, and Matt Dillon, whose once promising career seemed to have stalled for many years, makes a fabulous comeback. This film was rated R for swearing and grossness, but its a good natured feature and a great date movie.",Null,0,0,12 September 1999
The Godfather: Part III," Don't Blame Puzo
","This had nothing to do with his brilliant book. Most of the plot was taken right from Rupert Cornwell's 'God's Banker', the true story of vatican banker Roberto Calvi (Frederick Keinszig in this movie), who helped sicilian mob leaders (including the sinister P-2 fraternal society) defraud the church of hundreds of millions of dollars (and was found hanging beneath Blackfriar's Bridge in London in 1982). The rest of the film was Francis Ford Copolla's hastily thrown-together distortion of Puzo's epic, one of the finest novels in history. I was so repulsed by the awful plot that I barely noticed the often cited incompetence of Sofia Copolla, Diane Keaton, and Al Pacino (as well as the incomprehensible casting of Bridget Fonda, Eli Wallach, and George Harrison). Connie, the weak, dimwitted housewife is now the Godmother??? I really feel bad that Copolla's several hundred million dollar salary and royalties was too little for him to avoid tainting his own name with such a disaster.",Null,1,2,12 November 1999
The Mission," Another fine film from Roland Joffe
","The Mission was a well written, well produced movie with terrific actors and authentic scenery. It should've won the oscar for best picture, for it was far better than Platoon. And I can't believe that Jeremy Irons didn't win an oscar here either. Oh well. Robert De Niro was great as captain mendoza, but he was unable to shake his new york accent (despite playing a spaniard). The cultural imperialism theme was adequately conveyed, without the hysterical opinionated frenzy of most other similarly toned stories. After all, the opening scene shows a nonviolent Jesuit crucified and floated over a waterfall by the natives he sought to help (though also convert). The lessons and irony of the story were also perfectly placed: the natives are shown to be victims, but was it their lack of savagery or technology that caused this? Of course the disturbing climax of the film was somewhat comforted by the ending, which briefly shows the children trying to rebuild their future. And Ennio Morricone's fantastic musical score was the highlight of the film, and a perfect complement to its rich south american locales.",Null,1,2,16 October 1999
Carrie," It Sucked
","Scary????? C'mon. This couldn't scare a three year old. Funny??? A little bit, but i was thinking more along the lines of annoying. I like seventies movies, but the clothing and hairstyles in this film were the worst of the era. As if the gaps in Nancy Allen's teeth weren't enough. And while I'm no horror movie maven, I thought that Psycho, Halloween, and Freddy's Nightmares were well made films. Even The Omen, which I didn't love, was a very scary movie. Carrie was not. Sissy was whining and cringing for most of the movie, and didn't evoke much sympathy from me. The final scene, where she literally kills the whole school, was the most ridiculous example of overkill i've ever seen (much like the end to DePalma's other famed flic, Scarface). Except for the five kids who tormented her (two of whom escaped) none of the others deserved their fate (especially the gym teacher who tried to help Carrie, what kind of gratitude is that??) I think that most people know that this film was bad, but if you haven't seen it, there's plenty of opportunities on TBS and TNT (don't worry about the editing, youre probably better off) and don't worry if you feel the need to change the channel.",Null,3,6,31 October 1999
Raging Bull," A Pleasure to Watch
","This is one of the few films worthy of being called a drama. And its probably the most accurate of the 'based on a true story' genre. Robert DeNiro has yet again proved that he is the finest American actor since Charleton Heston, for he transforms himself into his role (unlike most actors, such as Hoffman, Pacino, and Newman, who merely attempt to imitate) literally becoming the character. It should have won the Oscar for best picture and director, especially since its rivals were so blatantly inferior.For those who didnt live in New York during the 40s, this film provides some fascinating history. And its black and white filming was an ingenious method of conveying the historical context. But it doesnt end there. The late 1970s New York locations were brilliantly chosen, for anyone who watches actual 1940s film footage of New York can see how closely they resemble each other. The scenes in the boxing ring, neighborhood swimming pool, and of course the spacious nightclub were truly fabulous and nostalgic.The supporting cast all deserved to win the oscars they were nominated for. Joe Pesci was outstanding in the 'mad mobster' role he continued in Goodfellas and Casino, and Cathy Moriarty was riveting as Jake's estranged teenage wife. Nicholas Colasanto ('Coach' from Cheers) definitly deserved an Oscar for his sharp portrayal of Tommy Como, the benevolent mob boss who gives Jake his title shot. This is definitly one of the top 10 films of the past 50 years, definitly see it if you haven't, and I reccomend having a plate of veal and spaghetti while you do!!",Null,2,3,13 August 1999
Ben-Hur," A Must See for Everyone
","This film is an obvious masterpiece, a real golden age cinematic extravaganza. It was the third remake, but of course the best. And it was showered with academy awards back when they actually meant something. Charleton Heston immortalized himself as the finest screen actor of the 20th century here, and this was his greatest role (even though The Greatest Show on Earth, The Ten Commandments, and of course Planet of the Apes are terrific as well). Stephen Boyd was superb as the friend turned archfoe Messala, and Jack Hawkins was brilliant as Quintus Arrius, Judah's slavemaster turned savior. The drama, action, scenery, cinematography, and characters were truly breathtaking from start to finish, even by today's standards. Of course no expense was spared to deliver realistic looking Roman ocean battle scenes and chariot races, which are the finest points in this finest of films. And the courage and humanity is so marvelously conveyed throughout, from when Judah is saved from collapse in the desert by a water serving Jesus, to his miraculous escape from death aboard a Roman Galley ship.
Obviously I loved this film, but don't take my word for it. See it on network tv or borrow it from your local library. Its probably better to see it on tape because you can take breaks from its 3 1/2 hour length. Not too campy for adults, and not too dramatic for children, its perfect for all ages.",Null,1,2,8 September 1999
The Deer Hunter," The Only Vietnam Movie Worth Watching
","On the right wing side, we've got John Wayne's Green Berets, Stallone's Rambo, and Norris's Braddock, which portray the Vietnam War with such jingoistic fervor that you'd think the American Revolution was merely the result of spilled tea. On the left wing side, we've got the Stone duo (Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July), as well as more forgettable flicks, in which U.S. soldiers in Vietnam do little more besides rape and butcher innocent civilians, smoke dope, and suffer numerous friendly fire deaths. The Deer Hunter blows em all away. Cimino's truly apolitical portrayal of the war, in which he shows the courage of men who fight for their country while also subtly questioning the horrors of the conflict itself, is not only original but also remarkably accurate. Even though many have angrily objected to the notorious Russian Roulette sequence, which may or may not have been a total fabrication (depending on who you believe, people who were there and testified to its existence or possibly biased journalists who assert that no sources exist to substantiate the claims), the real-life documented horrors of captured POWs were far worse. Shoving bamboo shoots under fingernails, stretching limbs with rope to the point of pain and often breakage, and other forms of NVA/VC torture were obviously too extreme for a mainstream film, and thus I am certain viewers are grateful for not having been exposed to such images. The initial roulette scene was my favorite in the film because of the bravery DeNiro's character exhibited under such pressure. It is definitely a unique moment in cinema history.",Null,0,0,30 July 2002
Heat," Al Pacheeso at his cheesiest
","I used to like old Al, back when he knew how to act. But ever since the first two Godfather movies, in which he was brilliant, his abilities have rapidly diminished. Now he's just the same husky voiced screaming neanderthal in every film, whether it be Scarface (a very stylish yet justifiably criticized film), Sea of Love (A low tide leftover cop flick), Scent of a Woman (another silly cliched disaster) or this dragged out feature, which was actually just a remade version of Michael Mann's tv movie released 6 years earlier. I guess Mann felt that a few extra loud sound effects, weirder music, more gunfire, and of course Robert De Niro and Al Pacino having coffee together would somehow make it all work, sadly he was mistaken. It takes some pretty lousy acting to make Scott Plank, the title character from LA Takedown (and Nick from Melrose Place and Wiley from Air America!)look like Laurence Olivier, but Pacino manages to pull it off. Val Kilmer is fairly talented and does a good job, as does Ashley Judd. Robert De Niro is a superb actor and no matter how crappy the film is, he and his abilities manage to emerge unscathed. It doesn't require a film school graduate to know that the ending to Heat is probably the most ridiculous and contrived since Lisa Blount's 'Way to go Paula!!' cry in an officer and a gentleman, so hit the stop button about 15 minutes beforehand. If you have to watch a trashy bank robbery movie, try Point Break, it doesn't try to hide its silly plot and has much better action scenes.",Null,0,0,10 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The only feature in the series worthy of 'blockbuster' consideration
","Brilliant story and action sequences are the result of everyone doing what they're supposed to. Lucas is handling set and story, not meddling in the dialogue or direction. Instead, he steps aside and allows a truly expert sci-fi screenwriter Leigh Brackett (with only minor help from more run-of-the-mill Lawrence Kasdan) and little-known but sharp director Irvin Kershner to deliver this absolute masterpiece. Take the film's dark tone for one. Every moment is a struggle against death for all of the protagonists, without the eager farmboy yearning to battle in the cosmos nonsense of its predecessor. And Yoda, good god! If there is one character that defines 80s cinema, who else could it be? 'Great warrior, oh, wars not make one great.' Adventure is certainly never in short supply here, demonstrated by some of the finest pursuit and dueling scenes ever to grace the screen. What really sets The Empire Strikes Back apart from its kin is its ending, where after being through what can be described without exaggeration as a living hell (even for the robots) the rebels take some time to recover and then prepare for the daunting challenge that faces them: rescuing their imprisoned comrade and defeating Vader and his emperor.",Null,0,1,7 November 2002
The Breakfast Club," What Breakfast?????
","When I first heard this movie, I pictured a delicious buffet of bacon and eggs, pancakes, sausage, danish, fresh orange juice, assorted cereals, hash browns, wow was I ambushed. Lukewarm cans of coke and cheap soggy sandwiches were all the food these guys ended up with, and perhaps thats the theme of the film, what looks like treasure is often trash. Breakfast Club (Shouldve been called 'High School is Prison') wasn't a bad film, and wouldve been better as an afterschool special if only they allowed F words. I liked the scenes where Judd Nelson tells Molly Ringwald where to stick it, and Carl the clever janitor was a nice touch as well. The film was an accurate depiction of high school's darker side (which too many kids are forced to endure, rather than just get to date cheerleaders and drive expensive cars)and certainly outclassed every other teen movie made since (except maybe for Ferris Bueller's Day Off).",Null,0,1,11 September 1999
Gladiator," It is indeed a cliched ripoff of past Roman films, exacerbated by needless computer animation
","The story is just a cross between Ben-Hur (who is made a slave while his family is imprisoned by a naughty Roman bureaucrat) and Spartacus, the slave-turned-gladiator-turned-revolutionary. Fine, I can deal with that. But shouldn't a film about Roman times at least attempt to make viewers feel like they're in ancient Rome? Instead, we've got what almost appears to be a video game about colliseum fighting, with rapid moving, computer-generated adversaries slashing about and losing their heads almost out of theatregoers' sights. CGI has its place in the cinema I'm sure (though I have yet to see a film that utilizes it effectively), but not here. Watch it to pass time and for a very mild thrill, but expect no more.",Null,1,2,5 July 2002
