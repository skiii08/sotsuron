Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," too bad...
",what a disappointment. they turned star wars into a disney movie. all the special effects in the world couldn't have saved this movie - there was cool graphics but they didn't really matter - they didn't mean anything. and it was just 'wimpy' film-making there wasn't anything cool about it. i really hope people voice their opinion on it - because i don't want the next one to bomb as well. when i walk out of a theatre i have a gut feeling of the movie and i had a stomach ache after this from squirming in my seat so much. i think the next one should be directed by the guy who did empire strikes back.,3,0,1,20 May 1999
Fight Club," brave issues
","stealing a comment from today's front page of imdb referring to iron giant; i believe the following applies to 'fight club' - 'We can't expect the studios to make good movies if we don't watch them.' Go see this movie! I personally don't need the box-office to signify if a film is good or not. however, i think it's a sad statement when something like 'double jeopardy' is held with more enthusiasm amongst movie-goers than 'fight club'. personally it makes me believe in the issues portrayed in films like 'fight club' even more! Like ed norton says, 'how embaressing, a houseful of condoments and no food...'. read in to that what you will. besides bringing up brave issues (by the way it is very american to bring up issues) fight club is directed and produced superbly, the acting was excellent, and if you insist on shutting off the thinking part of your brain it still look's genius and the sequencing is very creative.",10,0,1,1 November 1999
