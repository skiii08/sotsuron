United 93," Superbly Captures A Real-Life Horror Story
","Like many, I was skeptical about how the first movie regarding 9-11 would be treated. I expected a typical Hollywood rant with information either distorted or exaggerated looking to 'Cash In' on America's biggest terrorist attacks.This film does none of those things. It is a caring, sensitive, piece of real-life horror that depicts that essence of human suffering and sacrifice. Many scenes are so powerful even when you KNOW what is coming, like a terrible accident that you can do nothing about. But still, the viewer's eyes are transfixed to the screen the whole time.Regardless of your political affiliation, and how you may feel about the war now, the film never takes any political sides, or preaches to the viewer any kind of political agenda. United 93 is a story about how the entire world changed on that horrible day. The film shows the chaos and madness that seems to demonstrate that horrifyingly, the terrorists on that day were more organized than the military, airports, traffic controllers, or security personal, who were supposed to prevent such a tragedy in the first place.You will be on the edge of your seat most of the time. While no one knows for sure the exact events of what transpired on United 93, the filmmakers and screenwriters did an excellent research job. It will probably be the closest to 'a true account' of what really happened that day. Some things remain unknown. For instance, based on flight data and phone calls from passengers before the crash, they had planned to overwhelm the hijackers by storming the cockpit. (The film takes this approach in a scene that will LEAVE you cheering!) But the Federal Aviation Administration Commission's report says that they think that the terrorists overheard the passengers planning to storm the cockpit, so they decided to crash the plan themselves. I think the former if it happened makes for a better movie.There are no bells and whistles or large accolades at the end. United 93 hits the ground and the credits role with subtle music. (A poignant and somber ending.) This is a film about trying to understand and come to grips with one of the world's largest tragedies that affected both the United States, and the rest of the world, in ways that are to this day beyond comprehension.I give United 93 a 9/10 because there are some issues that will never be known and it's impossible to have perfect accuracy when much of what was said on the plane (if not all the planes) is speculation. However, the filmmakers did an incredible job with this speculation. Many people who were actually involved in 9-11 participated in the making of this film, from flight crew who played the role of passengers who worked for United Airlines, to air traffic controllers, who were on duty that day Using real people gives the film even greater depth and meaning, making United 93 more of a documentary than a film. THIS IS A MUST SEE!",9,2,3,31 January 2007
Stripes," Great First Half. But Than, Stripes Loses Comic Punch.
","Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, 'I think your ready for the Special Olympics!' Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, 'You speak some English?' The student answers back 'SOB and $hit' and the whole class than repeats it.The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable 'Ox.' There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, 'Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.' rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",6,37,41,6 May 2008
Dead Poets Society," One of The Most Beautiful, Inspirational, Films Ever Made!
","I absolutely love this film! Everything from the beautiful cinematography, to the pacing and the directing is purely magical and awe inspiring! There are many powerful moments in this film. Dead Poets Society motivates me intensely, with its message that you have to have the courage to follow your dreams, to live your life the way you want. Be willing to stand up to authority, if that authority stifles your dreams.Robin Williams is brilliant here, but so is Robert Sean Leonard! In fact, all of the young actors are outstanding! Especially for Robert Sean Leonard and Robin Williams, viewers are drawn into this film as if you knew the characters they play and the emotions they feel. You envision John Keating, (played by Robin Williams) as the inspirational teacher you once had, or wish had. You automatically empathize with Neil Perry (Played by Robert Sean Leonard) dreams of becoming an actor, against the wishes of his ultra-authoritarian father.I indirectly know someone who had an ultra-strict father like Neil, and sought a free-spirited life away from his demanding father and his family's rigorous lifestyle and demands of academic success. This person devoted his life to reading, philosophy, the hippie movement, writing, and humanitarian efforts. He was troubled by inequities and hypocrisy in society. He loved to help people, everything he did was for humanity. Both Neil and Mr. Keating would move him to tears! They would understand this person I knew, and I think of him every time I see this movie. It moves me, deeply.Dead Poets Society encourages others to become free, independent, thinkers. To believe in yourself, and to show how writing and the power of poetry can inspire you and others around you. The sensitivity that this film shows is stunning! This movie will make you think and melt your heart! It is very emotional! 'Carpe Diem! Seize the Day! Make your lives extraordinary!' See this landmark film!",10,3,4,8 December 2014
Taxi Driver," Psychological Breakdown is Better in Theory Than in Practice
","TAXI DRIVER tells the dramatic tale of Travis Bickle. He is a cab driver, who is haunted by disturbing images of New York City's dark undersides of crime, confusion, prostitution, and corruption. As Travis tries to integrate into the sleazy undertones of the city, he becomes obsessed by the environments around him. He is eventually driven to madness by urban decay.The fast pace and disarray of New York is brilliantly demonstrated in this film. Travis, in search of anything that he can bond with, is forced into picking up prostitutes, often with very sad and bitter results. Various events, such as these, drive him further and further to the breaking point.Great cinematography and acting however are compromised by an often very boring storyline where the viewer can not develop any type of connection to the other characters. Other than Travis, supporting actors seem to exist only in reactionary roles to show how the pain of the underworld effects him.I was turned off as well by Travis' first person narratives. His 'diaries' were no longer interesting after the first several entries and became monotonous. Travis doesn't really DO anything in terms of action sequences until near the end of the film. However, by this time, I was bored because I wanted something to happen on screen. TAXI DRIVER, can at times convey powerful psychological FEELINGS of HOW someone may respond to urban madness. But there is not enough action in the story to maintain interest throughout the film. Most viewers will know what is going to happen before it happens. You will also spend a great deal of time just waiting for something to happen.TAXI DRIVER is similar to looking at a mental health practitioner's notes on a patient who paints a road map that the person may be disturbed. It than tries to go inside the mind of the disturbed patient and the viewer is supposed to be incredibly absorbed into what he/she is thinking. But if you know the person or the similar situations presented by him/her in their own life, the practitioner's notes just reinforce what is already known.Instead of surprises or strong action sequences, which TAXI DRIVER should have been, the viewers get a psychological road map of New York and its undertones as portrayed in Travis' mind with a predictable conclusion. This results in an OK film, but nowhere near what it could have been. Taxi Driver is overrated.",6,5,10,26 December 2007
The Shining," A Modern Dissent Into Madness. But Some Flaws Getting There.
","The Shining, tells the story of a caretaker who is assigned to look after a hotel with a sinister past. His wife and young son are with him. Early on, we learn that the son is clairvoyant. He can see the past and future, along with the sinister surroundings that they bring.An employee cook at the hotel is also clairvoyant and he tells the son about the power that he has. The Overlook Hotel is a very evil place, where a former caretaker murdered his two daughters years ago. Jack Torrance, played superbly by Jack Nicholson seems almost eager to descend into madness as the new caretaker! With the hotel as his responsibility and everyone else gone except his family, the film gives new meaning to the phrase, 'Cabin Fever!.' There are some very good suspenseful moments in The Shining. Nicholson is excellent as always. His wife Wendy, played by Shelley Duvall, and son Danny, played by Danny Lloyd, also deliver fine performances. But there are some small issues with the film.One of the problems is that Nicholson seems to be close to crazy before even getting the caretaker job! There is not enough build-up for his character to develop into something crazy brought on by the hotel's forbidding feeling of isolation. His 'Madness' is already there and just gets worse as the film progresses.The film is also VERY predictable because you know what's going to happen with Nicholson's character. You can see his 'Madness' coming a mile away. However, Jack acts the part so well that you almost can forgive the film's predictability flaws.One of the film's best scenes is with Scatman Crothers talking to Danny Lloyd about his clairvoyant (i.e 'Shining') ability. While Duvall is very good at acting or reacting to Nicholson's madness, the unfortunate situation is that there isn't much else for her to do but shriek, run, or protect her son from Nicholson.However, The Shining is still a very good film because of Nicholson. Without Jack, and his brilliant acting skills, this would not be a good movie. Additionally, middle scenes drag because the viewer is waiting to get back to Nicholson on screen and when he is on screen, you can't take your eyes off of him.If the lesser characters had a better script to act on, rather than react to, Nicholson's behavior, the film would have been a classic. The problem is that The Shining's lesser characters often exist in superficial roles. However, The Shining delivers some fine moments of dramatic tension and suspense. It's not a classic, but is still well worth watching.",8,1,2,24 May 2007
Disturbia," A Very Entertaining Modern Mystery Thriller!
","Disturbia is a modern twist on Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' with a gripping storyline, fast-paced direction, and an excellent performance by a fine young actor, Shia Labeouf who plays his lead exceptionally well! The film opens with a touching flashback of father and son on a fishing trip. On the way home, a car accident occurs, and the father is killed. One year later Kale (Labeouf) suddenly lashes out at his Spanish teacher for making a remark about his deceased father.Sentenced to three months of house arrest, Kale begins to enjoy the life and luxury of video games, cable, and surveying the neighborhood with his video equipment, including the beautiful girl Ashley who moves in next door. Ronnie, another friend of Kale's, visits him. They provide Kale's only connections to most of the outside world. Being under house arrest as his sentence for striking the teacher, Kale must wear a surveillance monitor strapped to his foot at all times. If Kale steps outside the perimeters of his own home, the cops will come to investigate.His mother cuts off his cable and I-Tunes account and Kale becomes more focused on a new mysterious neighbor Mr, Turner who has moved in next door and always seems a little wired. His mother meets him at the supermarket and Turner has now invaded her life, his girlfriend's, and his good buddy. As Kale begins to investigate Turner, a series of unfortunate circumstances, for which Kale is not at fault, happen to him. Already under house arrest, Kale must try to convince his friends and his Mother that Turner is a vicious serial killer. Kale's Mother is slow to believe that Turner is a bad guy, but the rest of the protagonists become convinced. Is is David Morse's CHILLING portrayal of Mr. Turner and the very convincing performance of Shia Labeouf that keep this film at the hight of dramatic tension! I was very impressed by the sincerity and intensity of Shia's acting ability in this movie! He is only in his early twenties, but all of his scenes are so natural and real that he acts with far more experience than his years would indicate! The low key, but equally intense impact of Mr. Turner, played by David Morse, is truly both dramatic and terrifying!The movie's conclusion is predictable, but it's both intense and suspenseful in getting to that point. Fine pacing and direction by D.J Caruso maintains viewer interest throughout the film. Disturbia is recommended viewing!",7,2,3,11 August 2008
The Exorcist," Good...But Dated By Today's Standards
","The Exorcist was the first film about demonic possession that was a huge hit late in 1973. The hype was amazing. They had theater managers dressed up as paramedics to promote the film because there were reports that people were fainting, vomiting, and getting all kinds of other sick symptoms when they saw this movie.The premise was good for it's time. Demonic possession in a pre-teen girl, parent doesn't know what to do, doctors run all the physical tests, including blood-work, and MRI's, everything is normal so.....AHHH HA!, the girl's possessed! We get the dramatic effects of head-spinning, vomiting, bed-levitation, and 'F*** Y**!' bombs enough to nauseate ourselves (at least in the uncut version.) Young Linda Blair certainly makes a good devil child. But the problem is that all of the adults in the movie, ranging from her Mother, to the doctors, to the clergy, serve as little more than reactionary figures to what Reagan does, or simply say, 'We don't know what the problem is.' So when the exorcism is finally performed, you KNOW that Reagan's gonna have a hissy-fit tantrum, scream profanities, and throw up.The beginning of the film goes on forever and is downright boring. It is almost as if the writers needed to add some subplots because obviously you can't have 2hrs of 'What do we do about poor Reagan's fits?' A great music score is a plus and you might get some scares and gross outs ONCE the first time you see it. If this was 1973 and I was writing this review than, I would give the film a higher rating because for that time, this was cutting-edge horror. But now, there are SO many films that can do the 'satanic child' story with even stronger supporting characters where you don't have to wait for 45 minutes for something to happen. (i.e The Omen.) The Exorcist has some good shock moments, but the story is too predictable, and the other characters are too one-dimensional to make it a great film.",6,1,6,1 February 2007
Good Will Hunting," Overuse of F-Word Kills A Good Film
","There are some excellent moments in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon, the genius, conceited, janitor working nights at MIT, doing the bars, and eying the women with his (real life) buddy and best friend Ben Affleck along with the Psychiatrist, Robin Williams, who tries to keep Damon out of jail and on the straight and narrow path.It's a very good coming of age character study, mixed in with some powerful scenic changes and moods. Director Gus Van Sant creates a genuine feeling for the characters and their situations so that you can (almost) feel empathy for Will Hunting and his troubled past. BUT...The film's tender moments are ruined to the point of destruction with the F-bomb coming out of Damon's mouth at every other breath. This approach seems to be more for shock value, and it is overdone so much that friends of mine who had seen this movie thought it was overkill as well. A couple of relatives walked out of the theater because the language became so bad it was like, 'OK, when is it going to stop?' The movie becomes a chore, a task to sit through when it shouldn't be because of the non-stop profanity. Many will think Damon doesn't need therapeutic guidance, but his mouth washed out with soap instead.This is a movie where I actually like the censored TV print better! Without the F-bombs, the story is so much better and delivers a richer meaning than leaving them in.The bad language really hurts what could have been a GREAT movie.",7,0,4,14 March 2007
Schindler's List," Almost Perfect, But Has One Serious Flaw
","There are so many heartfelt words that describe the beauty, passion, and heartbreak of Schindler's List that it would be impossible to list them all. Spielberg's captivating story of how Oscar Schindler saved 1000's of Jews from the Nazi's death camps is one of the most inspirational moments ever captivated on film. Particularly brilliant (mild spoiler here) is the director's use of black and white photography, spare a haunting scene of a little girl in a red dress crying out 'Goodbye Jews.' It is absolutely chilling, and hauntingly spell-bounding.The question is, why can't I give this movie perfect 10/10 stars? I have to mention another spoiler here to explain this. There is a scene in the movie that is a sharp contrast from reality where one of the trains that is supposedly headed for Auschwitz gets misrouted, and the prisoners on the train get a cold shower with water instead of the poison gas. This one scene has always bothered me. All documents of the Holocaust show that tragically, and horrifying, when the prisoners were forced to leave their homes to go to the death camps, they were either gassed to death or tortured to death by doing some of the cruelest labor work imaginable. If you survived, it was through some of the greatest courage and determination ever known, not because of a misrouted train and 'regular' shower.In reality, no one 'escaped' with just a water shower. But here, instead of showing the realistic horror of the death camps, Spielberg pulls away from the reality by choosing 'not to offend.' This makes no sense to me. A movie about the Holocaust should be graphic, it should be horrifying, and realistic in its telling. 'The Shower Scene' wants viewers to think 'some lived because of a misrouted train.' This one scene sugar-coats the horror of the death camps, and hurts what otherwise is so close to a perfect film. But I will tell you about a film that is just as good as Schindler's List, even better, because NOTHING is sugar-coated. It is the NBC mini-series from the late 70's, Holocaust. That picture is still the best Holocaust film ever made. Schindler's List could have been just as good as Holocaust. Unfortunately, the fictional shower scene hurts this otherwise landmark film.(I also will copy this review to the Message Board, because I want as many people to see this comment as possible. I have a feeling that I am not alone in this view of the film.)",9,7,14,13 April 2008
Caddyshack," Has Some Funny Moments. But Hardly A Classic
","Don't get me wrong, The film has some funny moments no question, and it is for many people a comedy classic. But for me, something appears to be missing or tainting the film from approaching symbolic comic status.It could be the predictability of the characters along with the shallow superficial jokes and situations that they are involved in, (i.e drugs, golf, and sex.) In my view, the film may be rated higher by the teenage crowd who are interested in this type of simplicity entertainment.There is also the issue that there is not enough comic plot for a full length movie. The 'big bet' golf tournament scene wants the audience to be drawn into the 'great moment of ha-ha comedy.' The problem is that the one-liner jokes, some of the best, in the first half-hour or so, do not make up for the rest of the movie that seems to drag and isn't sure where it wants to take us. Maybe, if you like golf, this movie will do more for you.Another problem is Rodney Dangerfield. While I am not a fan of his personally, I ADORED his work in the movie 'Back to School.' where he had some GREAT one-liners. In Caddyshack, every word that comes out of Dangerfield's mouth is neither funny nor clever, it is just obscene. I have no issue with R-rated language when it serves a purpose in any movie. But here in Caddyshack, I failed to see the point of Rodney's character other than to drop F*** bombs. What's the point? There are some great veteran comic actors in this film. It's just too bad that they didn't have a stronger storyline or a funnier script throughout the movie to make it better.",5,2,12,16 January 2007
Rudy," Beautiful! Inspirational!!! 'A Real Life Rocky!'
","Rudy is the ultimate 'feel good' movie that is absolutely awe-inspiring and superbly motivational in its storyline and character development. Sean Astin delivers without question the performance of his career as the real-life Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger who overcame insurmountable odds in size and academics to eventually pursue his dreams of going to the University of Notre Dame and playing football for the 'Fighting Irish.' I don't think I have ever seen a better youth performance in the history of film! There is no question that Sean plays 'Rudy' so well, that it is comparable to Rocky or The Shawshank Redemption, with one element that makes it EVEN BETTER than these movies. The story is true! Sean is heart-stopping amazing in this movie. The ending scene may move you to tears. If it wasn't for Sean's brilliant acting in this film, 'Rudy' would have been just another good movie. Sean takes this film and catapults it from very good to cinema masterpiece.I can not find one flaw in this film, not one. How many times can anyone say that about a film where the lead character is that good? Sean's emotional impact in this film is reminiscent of Al Pachino in The Godfather, or And Justice For All, or Jack Nicholson in The Shining and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.'Rudy' will move your heart and inner soul. It's the inspirational experience of a lifetime, maybe several lifetimes.",10,0,0,14 March 2008
Quiz Show," Redford's Best! A Masterpiece of Modern Cinema
","Quiz Show details the infamous examination of the TV game show scandals of the 1950's. The film focuses on the most famous scandal, the rigged quiz show 'Twenty One.' This is a film that makes the viewer question the morals and ethics of the time period. It also examines how far people will go to violate those ethics and morals for big money.In the 1950's, game shows were a big business. The pilot episode of Twenty-One was not rigged. However, the questions were so hard that games often ended in 0-0 ties. NBC higher-ups were desperate to try to get the show the needed ratings boost. Show producers Al Freedman and Dan Enright came up with the idea of screening for 'Good looking', often stereotyped, WASP contestants. To insure the show's success, popular contestants were given questions and answers that were to be used on the show in advance to keep them on the show longer.The movie analyzes in depth how many played along with the charade. Contestants were scripted not only with the questions and answers they would be asked on the show, but were also coached on how to answer. (i.e amount of time pausing, how to stammer when unsure about a question. How to show just the right amount of emotion when responding.)Herb Stempel was a geeky Jewish kid from Queens New York who was sharp and smart, but rapidly losing popularity with the Twenty-One audience because he had a dull personality. In contrast, Charles Van Doren was an aspiring English professor out of Columbia University. He was brash, charismatic, good looking, and was talked by Freedman and Enright to appear on Twenty-One as Stempel's most famous challenger.Van Doren had wanted to play legitimately, but Freedman and Enright were convinced that Herb was unbeatable and demanded that Stempel take a dive on a Movie Category question. 'What Motion Picture Won The Academy Award for Best Picture in 1955.' Herb Stempel had seen Marty, the correct answer, many times. However, he was forced to pause, pretend that he didn't know the answer, and demanded to answer 'On The Waterfront.'The movie traces Herb's outrage at being manipulated and exploited by the producers in being forced to throw his tenure at Twenty-One on such an easy question. Herbie decides to bring about Richard Goodman, who heads a Senate Subcommittee, to expose Van Doren, Freedman, and Enright for their fraudulent, unethical, practices. It is later discovered that Stempel himself was also given questions/answers in advance. Therefore, he was himself a player in a rigged game.Many of you will experience outrage over how Freedman and Enright manipulated and deceived the public in this historic film. The actors do a brilliant job in recreating their famous roles. Even supporting actors play their small roles to perfection.A few differences between the movie Quiz Show, and the actual Twenty-One Show:1.) Charles Van Doren and Herb Stempel played a series of 'scripted' tie breaker games before the famous 'Marty' movie question.2.) The question about Marty was worth 5 points, not 3.3.) Questions in the movie that recreate the famous Van Doren-Stempel final match were not the same as in the actual show. They were a composite of similar questions asked throughout the run of the show.4.) Van Doren 'won' and became new champion when he elected to stop the game in the second round .5.) According to Game Show historians, only the first showing of Twenty-One was not rigged (but the questions were too hard, resulting in several 0-0 tie games.) The last show was also not rigged because Freedman and Enright had been exposed and tried to make the game legit at the last minute, but it was too late because the scandal had long been established.Quiz Show is a brilliant portrait of director genius! It's so good, it feels more like a documentary than a movie!",10,1,1,4 February 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternally Confusing and Disappointing
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a complex character study of a couple's relationship with an experimental twist. What would happen if turbulent memories of their relationship were erased? How would they react to themselves, each other, and the world around them? The story on paper may represent an interesting scientific research project for some advanced college experimental psychology course. However, in being conveyed to film, ESOTSM doesn't work. The film has more continuity holes than swiss cheese! Time sequences shift all over the place, along with dialog that is disjointed and discombobulated. There are so many scene changes, life changes, and character subplots, that come and go on a whim that you don't know how to follow the movie, and if you do follow the movie, you become confused and utterly lost. What is worse, is that without a road map to follow, or at least SOME beginning, middle, and end to the story, many viewers will not care about this relationship, because there is no reason to do so.The movie would have been better with a firmer placed start, middle, and finish, getting to know the characters, the risks and benefits of the memory experiment, and having the actors relate to the viewers their thoughts and ideas through time periods that are at least somewhat organized or have closure to them. You need a PhD to try to figure out who's coming and going in this movie! By the time you learn about the character(s,) they disappear off the screen. When you see them again (if you even see them again) you're thinking, 'Now, who were they again? What are they doing here?' The whispering, often drowning out the dialog, makes the plot even more hard to follow. There is far too much happening at once with not enough substance, consistency, or empathy, about the characters to really care about this film.",4,3,8,23 January 2008
There's Something About Mary," The Something About This Movie? Below Average and Predictable
","I remember when this movie was released that it was considered to be a comedy cult classic. To many it still is. But my observations of the film show that the story lines and character developments leave 'something' to be desired. The movie traces Ben Stiller's life beginning in high school as he plans to ask the popular girl of his dreams to the prom. Stiller's character is awkward and geeky. While getting ready for the prom, he gets his genitals caught in his zipper, and facing this ultimate embarrassment he is determined to seek her out to make amends for this humiliation.He hires a sleazy private detective to help find Mary. He is madly obsessed with her, as is the detective along with all of their screwball friends. There are varies sophomoric antics and toilet humor jokes that may be funny if you want a typical teen screwball comedy. However, all of the actors are much too old for this sort of mindless drivel. There are a couple of haha jokes but nothing worthwhile or memorable. Why this film is so popular I do not understand. The moronic humor exists for sheer slapstick value. The 5th graders who bully the poor helpless outcast by putting a 'kick me here' sign on his butt would be the type of people who would give this movie high reviews. That in a nutshell represents the humor of this film.Because of the cruel edge to this film, feelings and relationships never develop. Stiller's relationship with Mary is bad margarine instead of quality butter. The writing is so juvenile and demeaning to relationships that by the end, nobody cares. Substance-wise, there is really 'Nothing About Mary' to signify this movie as a quality film. Only see it if you like slapstick. Otherwise, 'Mary' is a film to avoid.",4,0,4,17 January 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," I Wish I Could Give This Film 20 Stars!
","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is the essential landmark triumph of all cinema. It is the standard by which other movies are judged. Nothing will ever surpass this film for its acting, directing, plot development, and the best landmark scenes in any film, period! My own family when acting dysfunctional often quotes scenes and phrases from this film!!!! Who doesn't know this story? Randle P. MacMurphy fakes mental illness to get out of a work farm jail sentence for statutory rape. He is sent to an asylum for a psychiatric evaluation. Being the fun rebel that he is, he sets out to challenge the hospital's no-nonsense rules and regulations overseen by the cold-hearted, controlling head nurse Mildred Ratched. (Or 'Nurse Rat-Sh*t' as I like to call her!) Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher deliver some of the greatest lines and scenes in movie history. MacMurphy inspires the other patients to instill confidence in themselves, and to rebel against Nurse Ratsh*t so that they can try to get some of their freedoms and dignity back. But she continues to demand that her authority and rules are never to be questioned, constantly belittling her patients with negativity by making them feel uncomfortable in HER 'therapy' sessions.MacMurphy leads a revolt against the system in several brilliant scenes. The gem is trying to persuade Nurse Ratsh*t to allow the schedule to be changed so that the patients can watch the World Series! (Hysterical comedy here, as well as throughout the movie.) But some scenes are painful to watch, such as a patient's suicide and Nurse Ratsh*t's vindictive cold remarks that the patients should just ignore it as if nothing happened and 'go on with the day.' This callus comment prompts MacMurphy to attack Nurse Ratsh*t in a scene that will leave you cheering! But as punishment, MacMurphy gets lobotomized in a heartbreaking conclusion that you will remember for the rest of your life.This movie was filmed at a real psychiatric hospital in Oregon. Most of the extras were authentic mental patients. The actor who played the Admissions Doctor, Dr. John Spivey was a real doctor, and head director at the hospital where the movie was filmed. Several of the admissions interview lines with Nicholson were improvised.This is the movie experience of a lifetime! Probably several lifetimes!",10,1,2,7 February 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Excellent Movie, But Not 'Greatest of All Time.'
","I finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an excellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest throughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving ending.The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out that he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a powerful message that it doesn't matter whether you are innocent or not inside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a sadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the intellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay alive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.Andy befriends 'Red,' a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in another great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival within Shawshank's hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master ability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials to get funds to set up a 'basic skills' learning facility within the prison's library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the funding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the head librarian, known as 'Brooks,' who delivers many amazing scenes in the movie.What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters, especially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise above the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are some disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of prison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or punished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at all. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison authorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above this abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They learn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other inmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. 'you can get busy living, or you can get busy dying.' Another interesting experience is how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to survive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An underlining message is that whether you 'get busy living or dying' you become so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the outside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and mentally 'free' are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance and the ultimate in determination.As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that would put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I think that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as good if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn Movie, 'Bad Boys' for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a juvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad officer in 'Shawshank,' is just as good as a prison bully in 'Bad Boys.') Another great movie is 'Midnight Express' which is (although loosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is another amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical score and some chilling moments.I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than 'Midnight Express' or 'Bad Boys.' This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am only putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison survival pictures that don't get the same credit that this movie does. Call this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for 'Midnight Express' or 'Bad Boys.' All three films have the same emotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is 'An Innocent Man,' which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is considered only above average.The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of similarities to other similar prison pictures, I can't classify it as great for all time",8,21,40,17 February 2008
The Producers," Overrated, It Takes Far Too Long To Get Going
","The Producers, starring Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel is about a broken down Hollywood producer, (Mostel) so desperate for money that he hires his accountant (Wilder) to come up with a crocked scheme. Create and produce a sure-miss Broadway flop, get the most gullible people to invest in the scheme, and than keep the money all for themselves without paying any money to their investors of the project. What they don't count on, is that the play they produce, 'Springtime for Hitler' becomes a shocking Broadway hit. What can they do, if anything to avoid jail? When I saw this movie some years ago for some reason, I remembered it being good. I just watched it again for this review and found it weak. Director Mel Brooks may have intended The Producers to be a laugh-filled riot movie. However, the film is flawed in many ways, which prevent it from achieving classic status. For one thing, there are annoying pauses in the opening credits of the film, where a bunch of jokes are told that are supposed to set the tone of the film. They are not funny at all. The movie than drags on to Wilder and Mostel making jokes about their mundane lives that once again fall flat.Even the preparation in finding people for the play is drawn out. The screen testing for 'Hitler' drags on, made even worse by of all things, a song that appears to be tacked on to the film to kill time. The Nazi jokes aren't even funny.The best part of the film is the song 'Springtime For Hitler.' It FINALLY gets the viewer into actually seeing the play. The ending number 'We're Prisoners of Love' is well done. But it is a L-O-N-G struggle and strain on the viewer to get to those parts in the movie. You have to wait for over an hour of an only ninety minute movie for those scenes. These songs save The Producers from being a complete dud. However, they occur too late to salvage my overall impression of the film.",4,10,18,9 July 2008
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Masterpiece of Modern Horror!
","I compare A Nightmare on Elm Street to such classic horror standards as Psycho and Halloween, with an incredible twist: a murdering child molester returning from the dead to terrorize the kids he didn't kill in their dreams! The concept is as terrifying as it is original and it will send chills down your spine.In this outstanding film, the suspense literally captivates, haunts, and grabs the viewer. You never know what will happen next! The cinema genius of Wes Craven is brilliant. My interpretation of this film is one can never be sure what part of it is in a character's dream state, and what part of it is actually reality (i.e in their 'awake' environments.)The plot involves a child molester named Freddy Krueger who was tried for murdering the neighborhood Elm Street children. He gets off on a technicality and an outraged group of parents seek to track him down and kill him for what he did to the kids. Now the current Elm Street kids are all seeing the same visions of a horribly scarred burned man with knife-life fingernails and a brown hat in their dreams.The local law enforcement are baffled and slow to believe, and the main protagonist named Nancy witnesses Freddy's killings and she begins to emotionally break down right before our eyes. She and her friends must do everything they can to stay awake so that Freddy not only does not kill them, but also so they can bond together to convince their parents and the police that Freddy is the killer. The only way that they can bring him to justice is for Nancy to try to bring him out of her dreams.Nancy is the main character that Freddy is after because her Mother, (who has turned into an alcoholic and paranoid basket case) took Freddy's trademark finger knives and dirty brown hat. Now Freddy is after Nancy and her friends for revenge! The music sets the mood of the film and never lets go. The scripting is fast-paced, and every character has important dialog to add to the suspense of the film.SPOILER: I love how Nancy's friend Glen tells her how she is able to channel her energy to take control of her dreams. You will have to see the movie to find out whether it works.........or not! The ending is pure genius and you will be stunned, and scared not only at the conclusion, but through much of the earlier scenes of the movie as well! This is the best film of the series. The third sequel called 'The Dream Warriors' is also very good. The rest of the sequels are poor. See this modern classic, (or I am sure for many of you) see it again! Horror films don't get much better than this. Oh, and whatever you do, 'DON'T FALL ASLEEP!!!!'",10,0,2,25 September 2007
Click," Some Good Moments Hurt By Slapstick and Confusion
","Click has a very interesting premise. Adam Sandler plays an overworked architect, who wants to devote time to his wife and family, but his work constantly stresses him out. While shopping at a store one night for a 'Universal Remote' that will simplify his life, he meets a very strange salesmen who shows him the ultimate in high-tech gadgets, a universal remote that controls his world. He can pause, rewind, and fast-forward events in his life and observe how he reacts to them. Adam's character thinks this is great. At first the remote gives him rewarding information. For example, he can skip bad events in his life and fast-forward to good things. However, it is not long before the remote is giving him information that he does not want to see or hear, leading to some very unpleasant and uncomfortable situations that involve his wife, kids, friends, co-workers, and supervisors.Click sort of plays like a George Orwell 'Big Brother is Watching You' novel, raising unique moral and ethical issues concerning not only how dependent our society has become accustomed to universal technology, but how that technology can be used where too much conveyance can hurt our relationships with family, the environment, and affect our health.Many scenes in the movie demonstrate the above issues. The problem is that they don't do so in a very sequential or logical manner. A big downside of the film is the interjecting of Adam Sandler's slapstick humor. One gross scene has him farting in a manager's face. There are on-going Junior-High School mentality jokes and comments about his wives' and his sex-obsessed dog. These scenes were stupid and totally unnecessary.Click also tries to bit off more than it can chew. It can not decide if it wants to be taken as a serious drama, sensitive comedy, or ludicrous slapstick. Adam's character, 'Michael's' work, life, and family events with the remote, is so disjointed and disarrayed that while the viewer is left with some good ideas about how a character might react to advanced technology, the execution of events is weak in too many scenes. So much continuity is lost. What could have been a good film, is reduced to average.Even on an emotional level, Adam Sandler is too much of a screwball for the viewer to care about what happens to him. The slapstick comedy, seemingly inserted into the movie solely because of him, is annoying and disgusting. The serious tones of the film are forced and unnatural because Adam does not do serious drama well at all.Click should have had a more dramatic actor in its lead role, an easier to follow script, and taken the slapstick out completely. Had these elements been followed by the writers and producers, this movie would have been so much better!",5,3,5,19 December 2008
The Breakfast Club," The Greatest 'High School' Film of All Time!
","The Breakfast Club is an emotional powerhouse of high school life! Five people from many different diverse backgrounds are forced to share a Saturday detention together. After almost nine hours, they bare their souls to each other and actually become friends. (Well, to varying degrees.) This is a movie that you feel, because it portrays the 'cliques' characters associated with high school life with such passion and power that you the viewer believe after watching this unforgettable film that you have known these people all your life! The Breakfast Club IS Andy, Claire, Brian, Alison, and John.The late Paul Gleason is chillingly realistic as the principle and disciplinarian. The tension that exists in his many verbal confrontations with John Bender (the most troubled and rebellious) is so dramatic, and captivating that it represents some of the finest moments that you will ever see in a movie! These kids and Mr. Gleason should have won Oscars for their performances because they were all THAT good! One may wonder, why haven't I rated this gem a full perfect 10/10? The Breakfast Club is SOOOOOOO good on so many levels that it hurts to find flaws with it, but here goes:1.) Carl The Janitor: The one guy that just doesn't work in this otherwise landmark film. He doesn't seem to have all that much to say except react differently to how Mr. Vernon and he feel about kids. It's not like he's a bad guy to have in the movie, just unnecessary. Bender makes a few snide remarks about him, and than we have a few lines of dialog when he and Vernon are in Vernon's office, and that's it. It's like Hughes said, 'Well, the setting is a Saturday School detention, so we can throw in a janitor.' He simply didn't need to be there and did practically nothing for plot or character development.2.) SPOILER! Bender being nice to Claire at the end: NO!!! NO!!!! Sorry!!! I don't buy it!The movie builds up with such friction where it is the worst between Mr. Vernon and John Bender. (Two people that would want to KILL one another because they hate each other so much.) Second worst friction is Bender's thoughtless and vindictive comments to Claire throughout the film. Remember this gem: Bender: (To Claire) 'Don't you EVER TALK ABOUT MY FRIENDS!!! YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF MY FRIENDS, YOU DON'T LOOK AT ANY OF MY FRIENDS, AND YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T STOOP SO LOW AS TO SPEAK TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS!!!! AS FAR AS YOU AND I WAKING DOWN THE HALL TOGETHER YOU CAN FORGET IT!!!!! CUZ IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!!! JUST GO BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND, AND WAIT FOR YOUR F***ING PROM!!!'Claire: (Crying and sobbing) 'I hate you, you know!' Bender: 'Yea??? GOOD!!!!!' But toward the end of the film, we see Claire GIVING John one of her earrings and a goodbye kiss!!!???? Are you kidding me??!! Than he tries to initiate closer contact but she stops him. I can't believe that they would do that. He'd walk up to her, give Claire and extended middle finger and spit in her face. That IS John Bender. Some of the physical make-overs seem to reflect the writers/or directors beliefs that emotional personalities can change when a woman changes her appearance with make-up and lipstick. Hughes take a too-easy and simple way out here. Let's make John nice to Claire so that we can have at least two of the group give us this, 'And some lived happily ever after.' This movie would be a perfect 10 if Claire and John would have hated each other throughout. At least take out the exchange of the earring for a kiss. It brings down the whole friction and tension that existed so well between these two characters.I also believe that you need to be 40 or under to see The Breakfast Club and experience its most dramatic effects and inner-messages about group cliques and high school life. Adults older than that may not care enough about the characters the way the 70's-80's generation does. For people in that 70-80's cohort, many LIVED THE LIVES of these kids. Be 40 or below and take yourself back to many changing times and difficulties associated with high-school acceptance. If you can empathize with the 40 and under age, or couldn't fit in at your high school other than already established social cliques, this is a shattering and powerful movie that will never be forgotten.Score 9/10",9,0,0,26 January 2007
