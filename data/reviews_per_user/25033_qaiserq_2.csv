Black Swan," A masterpiece and an Oscar-Nominee Role
","I was much anticipating this one from Darren Aronofsky, and when this came and hit the big screen, wow, the movie is a master-piece. The movie revolves around Nina (Natalie Portman, who has performed a perfect role, as she says in the end, 'I did Perfect!'), Nina is a ballerina in NY ballet company and she is trying her level best to achieve the perfection in becoming Black Swan. She possess the capability to perform White Swan in the new ballet directed by Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), but her dark-twin the Black Swan is not coming out. This movie is a special treat for Perfectionists, who live their lives in achieving perfection in whatever field they are, yes, and they are serious about their work, in fact mad about it. The supporting cast Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey (Nina's Mother) has performed well to groom the main character, but i still think Cassel did not give his level-best in this one (like he performed in Eastern Promises, Brotherhood of the Wolf, etc). But you must watch this one to see Oscar-Nominee performance by Natalie Portman. Chao!",9,1,5,29 December 2010
Cinderella Man," A great boxing movie, with superb performances from Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti
","Russell Crowe, being one of my favorites (Since 'A Beautiful Mind'), this one had to be a must watch! Director Ron Howard join forces with Russell Crowe (an Oscar-Winning combination) and delivers a superb and perfect boxing movie in the era of great depression. This movie is supported by excellent cast performances from Rene'e and Paul Giamatti. Paul is a must see; has delivered some really superb scenes in this movie. This movie revolves around 'Jim Braddock', who was an inspiration in 30's when he had a come-back in boxing and became a champion, supporting his family in the era of depression at the same time. A MUST SEE for Ron Howard and Russell Crowe fans!",9,1,1,23 September 2010
