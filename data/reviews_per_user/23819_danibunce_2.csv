The Avengers," Amazing movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",Great movie. Huge marvel fan. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen in the next scene. Perfect amounts of seeing each character/actor/actress. They do not over show one person more then the other. You see them all the same amount which makes the movie so much better! Perfect! I have no complaints about this movie! There has been a lot of people arguing about Mark Ruffalo playing The Hulk. People are worrying that he will not be as good as Edward Norton from the incredible hulk. Well I have news for you... He is better!!!!! He should have been playing hulk/bruce in all the other movies! 10 out of 10 for The Avengers!!!! Fantastic in imax 3d! Fantastic in 2d! Fantastic Movie! Why are you still reading my review? Get to the movie theater and watch this movie already!!!!,10,4,9,12 May 2012
Dark Shadows," Pretty good but a lot of forced comedy that was not funny
",I am a huge johnny depp fan and tim burton. I have watched some of the original dark shadows TV show from 1967 on netflix ( i am 21) the movie is not like the show so if your all about the show you will not like the movie. The movie would have been better if there was less 'forced comedy' some things were funny on there own but then there would be some things you knew were forced to try to make audience laugh when they shouldn't have been laughing at all during those parts of the movie.. odd random stuff in the movie. You would be watching a serious part and then they would try to shove something funny into the scene. When you watch the movie you will understand what i mean.. One moment the movie would be dark and Gothic like the tim burton we all love.. then the next... colorful and happy/funny.. It left you confused on if you should be on the edge of your seat or saying 'wtf'. But it was a fairly good movie none the less and with great acting!!!! I will watch this movie again. OH and Johnny Depp looked AMAZING! Nothing like a sexy vampire :p,7,1,9,12 May 2012
