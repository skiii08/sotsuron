The King's Speech," Well deserved for Firth
","Colin Firth has been in this industry for years, decades in fact but only now is he delivering outstanding performances. He deserved his Oscar. For the film itself, while good, doesn't leave you with that feeling of a mystical awe. Lifting story no doubt. The running time is spot on because watching Firth stutter for two hours can leave you tired.Geoffry Rush was another who deserves an applause. Playing as the commoner Aussie, he enables Viewers to cling themselves to some emotional knot. The relationship between a king and a commoner is a intriguing one and most importantly makes you feel for King George because quite frankly, i don't really give a damn about the monarch today. If Rush played a rich tutor then this film would of fallen flat on it face.If there was one reason to watch this film, then it for Colin Firth's culminating performance. Inspiring and a delight to the eyes, The King Speech is worth watching",7,0,0,10 May 2011
The Mask," The best of Carrey
","It's silly and it's childish. It's typical Jim carrey during his earlier years. This film is one of the reasons why I miss the 90s. Films today have seemed to take an serious, meaningful purpose to their delivery.Thankfully, I can watch films like the mask anytime I desire and bask in the silliness. If you go into this film wanting to see Carrey act like a Pratt then you will leave happy. However, if you expect some sort of rational story then you will leave not so happily. The scenes where he turns green always delivers the laughs.Overall, embrace in Carrey's charm and childish demeanour, he will no doubt leave you rolling on the floor laughing",7,0,0,29 January 2012
Black Swan," Black swan
","A dark tale about a young ballerina who desperately wants the lead role for the prestigious production Swan lake. With her mother being a complete control freak over her life, things are tough and fulfilling her dream of becoming the lead role suddenly becomes arduous.While there is a lot of dancing to be admire, you only witness it from the neck above only. At times, your viewing the characters seemingly hopping around on stage.The whole film has a morbid cloud hanging over it and when you think she finally on track, you always feel a sense of misfortune.the ending wasn't particularly powerful and the film itself, while having some interesting and at times, sickening, wasn't good enough to earn a second viewing",6,2,3,3 March 2011
The Expendables 2," So tight...
","The main appeal that caught your attention on the first film was the cast and while it failed to deliver, watching these iconic action stars hero's together was fun. Thankfully, a balance has been inserted in The Expendables 2, an warm glow that couldn't be felt in the first film. The characters know there role and for that, the film progresses organically rather than stuttering along, throwing explosives and head-shots at you every 15 minutes.And with the new additions added to the cast list, the action scenario that Stallone strives for with film number one are now palpable. The inclusion of JCVD is enough to make you want to watch it, no matter how disgusted you were at TE1. And this leads me to say: it's easy to mix JCVD with Norris, more so after laughing at his tight pants, but here, playing as the villain, he completely stoles the show. The only scene with him that let me down was the final fight scene but no big deal. And of course Norris; made more famous by the internet than the films he has starred in. His role might be brief, but that doesn't stop him from adding a dosage of humorous charm.TE2 is very much like the first film but without the rigidness. The story is sufficient for an action film and the action scene's themselves are brilliantly shot.so tight.",7,1,2,7 February 2013
The Hangover," Don't understand the fuss
","I don't think i ever burst out laughing during the duration of the film. Giggled, yes, but never pissing myself laughing like i expected on the account of many reviews.The Hangover is engaging to say the least but i wouldn't slap 'comedy' on it. But of course, it's a comedy and this can only result in me saying that this film does a miserable job at attempting to make you laugh. The grizzly, beard Zach fellow is quickly becoming one- dimensional in the land of Hollywood and even judging the art work of future films that star him on DVD covers, you know how he's going to be.Juvenile humour, which isn't a bad thing as such humour can be disguised behind matured characters and conversations, is what this film is. The only credit i can give it is that it was engaging and never lost it's grip on the plot but it simply fails at making you laugh.",4,0,2,17 April 2012
Training Day," Training Day
","A lot can happy in a day, ask Ethan Hawke character Jake Hoyt and he'll agree. Hoyt is a rookie looking for some invaluable experience from a top man in the police force. Unfortunaely, This cop, name Alonso, isn't so clean cut. Washington doesn't play the typical good guy this time round. As the film progress, his character becomes complex and watching Hoyt tailor to the situation is a interesting affair.It one of the films that has a easy story to follow, one of those that with the wrong cast or directer, could easily become a train wreck. Thankfully, training day is superbly executed. The film rolls to the finish line in what seems very little time, the cinematography gives the film a different look than others in the same genre. Acting as you expect is sublime and the conclusion is highly satisfying.Brimmed with a glut of memorable quotes and scenes, Training day is a film that doesn't disappoint",8,1,1,10 May 2011
Se7en," just how I like'em
","Thrillers are either a hit or a miss. They can be awesome while many can be awful. Seven is in the Very awesome category. Basing the film around the seven deadly sins is an concept that everyone can relate too. We have all sinned meaning we can be put ourselves in the shoes of the victims ( not all victims mind you ) . When you imagine a film in which it always cloudy and overcast with rain pouring down 24/7 , you would think it going to depress you . Truth is , you don't actually notice the weather , but instead take huge interest on what happening in the homes of the city.I'm not an huge fan of Brad Pitt but it seems that when he teams up with Fincher , he always puts on an good performance. Then there's Morgan Freeman, which is fairness, is playing Morgan Freeman. He fun to watch but you know what type of performance he going to act out. Both are very good but the one who steals it is Kevin Spacey. He may be in it for 20 minutes, but his role is extremely memorable. His character is well made and maybe deserves a bit more screen time . The film is very well made and an joy to watch. It keeps you awake and leaves you to wonder about the next deadly sin. When watching it, you can clearly see that Seven was an influence towards Leigh Whannell and James Wan and there SAW film. Everything about SEVEN was great, the concept, the acting, the finale. I highly recommend this film.",8,2,2,14 November 2009
Public Enemies," Filled with great moments but ruined by shallow characters
","During the great depression, John Dillinger and his gang loves to rob banks. After leaving prison on parole and then successfully breaking out his men, We follow the life of Dillinger who robs with ease and then hides out among the public.The film looks beautiful and filming it in HD was a great decision. Mann captured the 1930s brilliantly and there nothing to complain about in the cinematography apartment. there are many great set pieces. The breakout at the beginning, the shoot outs , especially in the woods and the suspenseful ending. This is all good when your interested in the main character. But unfortunately, John Dillinger , while interesting, is actually quite boring. he like your typical science lecture on DNA, interesting but you wouldn't care if you missed a lesson.He tells you where he off too , far away from Cuba as possible, but you only know as much as Billie does, his girl. there a couple of lines in the film in which he tells you his type of personality. 'I was raised on a farm in Moooresville, Indiana. My mama ran out on us when I was three, my daddy beat the hell out of me cause he didn't know no better way to raise me. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, whiskey, and you... what else you need to know?'. If i'm going to be in your company for the next two hours, i would like to know abit more thank you very much. We know he robs banks and this is what we keep seeing through out the film. No depth at all, very shallow.Bale, well, is he still in his Batman role? At times i think so. He gives a decent performance but nothing outstanding. Same goes for the rest, just fillers. While the film does have many great moments, it Dillinger himself which lets the film down. Johnny depp gave a average performance , which isn't good enough when your carrying the whole film. Would i watch it again? most likely not",6,0,1,21 June 2010
Resident Evil: Extinction," Resident evil: Extinction
","Extinction moves away from the amateurish and dull action of the first two films and instead aims for a more polished, eye-pleasing experience. The one area which has been greatly improved is the make-up: the zombies actually look somewhat frightful compared to the shoe-polish-under-the-eye type in previous entries.The script and storyline is no different though, with it being standard enough to keep your attention. The story was never real resident evil's problem though, but instead the dreadful action scenes which conjured no sense of suspense; that what let down the previous film.The same old characters are back with new arrivals and the story continues to follow Alice as she tries to keep out of umbrella's line of sight. Many fans will be peeved with the switch to action/horror from horror/(dull)action but i think letting the characters do there business while we watch them shoot zombies in a professional style works. The character's themselves are dreary and only tepid enough for us to imagine only spending an hour and half with them, but they do there jobs in making sure the film is at least enjoyable.Overall, an step up from the previous films.",7,0,3,28 February 2013
Snatch," Snatch
","If you loved Lock Stock, then without a doubt, you will also love Snatch. Both films are very similar with Snatch being more serious. But Snatch has everything that Lock stock. For one the characters are so well written that the leap out from the screen. Statham and Graham are brilliant while Pitt delivers with being a Pikey, a role in which it nice to See Pitt doing . The others also do a brilliant Job specially Ford and Vinnie Jones . Ritchie has a nack for creating brilliant characters and this follows with great one liners. The film doesn't roll more than 5 minutes without a line that will make you chuckle are sticks in your head.There a lot going on but not enough to make you confused. If you loved Lock Stock, then there no doubt you will love this.",8,0,1,4 July 2010
The Town," The Town
","If you're looking for a action film that tells a good story with developed characters, then look no further than 'The Town'. For the past couple of years, Hollywood have been spitting out rotten films with predictable stories and flat characters. But now, we have this film which while it holds the typical credentials of a Hollywood film E.G the ending and at times whiny love story, it manages to shy away from the audacious crap spews out from the teats of Hollywood's money cow Ben affleck as an actor is like marmite. Personally i'm not a massive fan especially after the gobble gobble anecdote but thankfully in The town he is at least bit likable and while the film progresses, secrets begin to unveil and you start to have some affection towards him. As a director, well this is where he really shines and his first two major films rambunctiously showcases his talent behind the camera. He knows how to pace a film, knows how to capture the atmosphere and most importantly , knows how to shoot some fantastic action scenes.This film will hook you straight from the start. Towards the end you will be rooting for Affleck. If anyone could pin point an leak in the story, it would be why a guy like Doug, would risk his own freedom to make his unaware victim happy. Of course, you could say i'm being argumentative seeing that his true shelf is revealed but one could easily say the story is OTT.Anyways, There enough attention to character to keep you hooked and enough action to keep the visceral eye catching",7,0,0,26 February 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Same old Same old
","First of all, if your wanting a modern thrilling action film, then your not going to find much anything much better than this. However, if you've watched the first two films which obviously is highly needed if willing to understand the plot, then i would say, depending on your amount of love for the trilogy, that you may find it tedious. In terms of structure and pacing, nothing has changed.Bourne has flash backs, he needs to expertly endeavour to his final destination by tracking down high associated workers, tapping into phones and of course, eliminating any assassin whom attempts to eliminate Boure. During all this, the men at the top, the one responsible for Bourne's secret mission and memory lost, all sit in their offices, scrutinising the surveillance cameras. Yes, it sounds very much like the first two. Of course i expect some similarities but the whole tracking down Bourne Scernio is becoming tiresome.I was tensed during the first two films but during the third, i became bored and didn't care to much about the long waited conclusion. When people complain about 'Saw' being the same thing every film, the same can be said for the Bourne Trilogy.I respect the story, it a fantastic story but the delivery is lazy. Thank God the story is excellent or i would of fallen asleep.",5,1,3,27 April 2011
Burn After Reading," Another cracker from the Coens
","The best thing about the Coen Brothers is that, they can create a half a dozen of main characters and then make up a ludicrous plot that intertwines between them. Burn after reading is no exception.The cast first of all is spot on. Second of all, the pacing is spot on. The film is not overblown nor does it try to focus on one particular character. You'll be seeing plenty of Pitt and Clooney , who are both brilliant.From the get go, we are thrown in straight to the action. As like most Coen films, nothing is spoon fed to you. If you miss ten minutes of this film then you'll most likely get lost as there always a twist and turn every couple of minutes.The final 15 minutes are hilarious, especially the last scene. Plus, there are also many other golden moments such as the Russian embassy and the reveal of Clooney's all mighty creation.",7,1,3,28 December 2010
The Bourne Identity," Bourne Identity
","I'm going to keep this short. First off, Matt Damon fits into Bourne like a glove. The partnership between him and Franka Potente is excellent. In fact, the casting is spot on. There are many brilliant set pieces such as the Car chase and Bourne's escape from the embassy.The Story is great and thankfully ends in enthralling fashion. The film speeds by like a bullet train. One may complain about the action scenes and the constant shaking of the camera but some won't mind or even notice it.Yeah, good film overall and with two more to be seen, this film won't fail to hook you into the future of Bourne",7,0,2,1 April 2011
Cast Away," Hanks shines
","For some, cast away will be boring and tedious. For the majority of the film , we watch Hanks as Chuck, fighting the odds to live another day and to one day, hopefully make it back home. It all takes part on a inhabited, isolated island. There not a lot to do except catch fish and smash open coconuts. But the film is not about surviving the harsh surrounding but instead about being mentally strong , fighting self physically problems and living for hope.I can't see anyone else but Tom hanks playing Chuck. He has the likability factor and most importantly he can act. he puts in all his effort for this performance. He has to carry the whole film as he the only living talking thing on that island. He has to pull the audience in, make us care enough to wish and hope that he makes it off the island and thankfully, Hanks didn't let us down. There no over the top obstacles he has to overcome physically. The biggest one is sorting out his infected tooth. Hanks biggest challenge was acting next to a volleyball named Wilson. The scenes in which he speaks to him could of came off as silly but Hanks is so brilliant that he makes us end up caring for Wilson us much as he does.Overall, I suggest everyone to watch this film",8,4,5,15 July 2010
The Shining," One of the best Horrors
","The shining deserves it recognition as the most terrifying film of all time. Stanley the perfectionist delivered the shining with perfection. Proving that he can conquer near about every genre. At the time of it release, the film was criticised of being to slow, too long and too hard to understand. Yes , it an physiological film, requiring an bright mind to understand it. Also at the time, Jack Nicholson's performance was panned for being to over the top. To me and many others, this is one of Jack's best known and beloved role. Jack delivered the goods. He was simply amazing as an recovering alcoholic facing the torment of isolation and the closed spaces that the hotel provided him. Then there's Shelley Duvall which in my opinion, played the best female horror character ever. Her role was believable, she acted like an mother would react. There was no falling over or ridiculous screaming, she gave an professional performance.Credit also goes for Stephen king. He wrote an original horror. Instead of an vampire or an werewolf or yet an mask murdered being the villain, Stephen thought the scariest thing of all is the human mind. Many people complain about the film being slow. Not once did I think this. What your watching is Jack doing what he does best, acting crazy. As the film progress, you see the effects the house and the surrounding has not only on Jack but the whole family ( as eventually they all become either crazy or slightly crazy). In fact the film races by. Another unique factor it has compared to other horrors is that it not by any means predictable, you don't know what going to happen next. It keeps you on your edge of your seat.The directing and camera work was brilliant. Stanley made the hotel breath , with its wide corridors . The tracking shots were beautiful and the music that kept playing through out the film was just an huge effect. It played the biggest part of creating an disturbing atmosphere. From the last hour, every scene is memorable. If you want the full effect, then watch it alone in the dark and after it finished, watch it again. By then you'll understand why this is rated number 1 on the most terrifying movie list",9,1,2,1 November 2009
"I, Robot"," I Robot
","After re watching this for the first time in many of years, i came to realise how corny Will smith's character ' Spooner ' is ( yes, i was relevantly young during first viewing). At times i cringed at some of the lines he came out with. It not Smith himself, but the dialogue. However, with it fabulous CGI and decent story which is cemented within the three laws, I Robot is another good Hollywood blockbuster.The story never dives in deep with the three laws, there just used to give focus to the story of Sonny, a robot which is ' Unique'. Spooner, a detective, is possibly the only human being on Earth he despises these robots and when he believes that One of them is responsible for the death of the Creator, everyone around is certain that he has lost the plot. This being the fundamental of the plot, it fairly obvious where the main protagonist will take us.The CGI is spectacular and worth the initial viewing. Smith's character in the second half becomes less of a walking parody and the set pieces are fantastic. With enough action and jaw dropping effects, this film is worthy off a viewing from those wanting action with a story to cling on.",7,0,1,29 April 2011
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The 40 Year Old Virgin
","The best thing about 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is that it effortlessly makes you laugh from start to finish. There's no cheap jokes or overly crude scenes. The interaction between Carrell and Co is perfect. Everything , from the direction to the pacing is delivered exceptionally well making the film a naturally unforced barrels of laughter.Carrell character never fully agrees with his 'friends' commitment to try and help him lose his virginity. The pressure that suddenly fulls upon Carrell shoulders enables you to feel some sort of unexpected sympathy. The films starts on a high and thankfully ends on one with the conclusion being satisfying.From the poker game to the Wax and dating scene, the film never stops bellowing out jokes, small or big. Nothing seems forced. A effortlessly good comedy",7,0,1,27 April 2011
Face_Off," No matter how many times you watch it - face/off never gets old
","Face/Off today is cheesy. Not that this is bad because it the over the top shoot outs, the hilarious one liners and a plot so bizarre that it instantly memorable. It one of those of those films which grabs you at the very start and throws you in with the characters , not letting go until the very ending . Something you expect for a action film.Travolta and Cage are exceptional. You won't forget these two rivalry for years to come after watching them both. The lines they are given can, at times, be cringe-worthy but you won't act negatively towards them as they fit in perfectly with the rest of the film.Woo delivers the shootouts with dedication and perfection. He never over does the slow mo and he adds plenty of eye candy. Every shootout in the film will stay cystal clear for years after viewing them.There not many negatives to this film. If your looking for a serious story and a realistic conflict between two men, then you will most likely not enjoy face/off. However, if you love explosions, OTT characters, rolling and diving and cool one liners, then this will won't disappoint.",8,3,5,27 October 2010
The Exorcist," The Exorcist
","Thankfully, The script was written by the author of the novel himself, William Peter Blatty. I believe if someone else attempted to write the story of the Exorcist for the big screen, then it wouldn't of been one of the greatest horror films todays.The Correlation between Blatty and Friedkin works in perfect harmony: With Blatty sticking close with the book's material ( as expected ) and then Friedkin having the perfect eye for delivering a film like this.What makes the Exorcist one of the best horror stories ever is the turmoil amongst The victim's mother's, assistance and the doctors who are desperately trying to heal her. It isn't just some waffle for an hour and an half. No stupid suggestions or cheap get-outs on finding the cure to the child's possession. However, if you're an Athiest, then you could simply laugh at the whole premise of an 'exorcism' but i would like to think that the majority of people can see beyond the ' science vs Religion' saga and instead just relish in witnessing the story between good and evil.Unlike many other classic horror films, The Exorcist's story line is delivered by a character narrative, one's personal struggle. Father Karris played by Jason Miller is one of Horror's greatest Protagonist to ever hit the screens. Then with the likes of Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow and lee.J.Cob acting out of their parts in perfect fashion, the Exorcist proves you can have outstanding, believable acting in Horror and still be frightening.Everyone on set played their part in ensuring the Exorcist will - just like the book - be one of the scariest, memorable horror films ever.",8,1,2,1 November 2012
Tropic Thunder," an perfect cast
","this is not the funniest film ever, but it still god damn funny. The cast list is brilliant. You got the best in the business all coming together for this film. From the opening the film blows you away. The action scenes are delivered by perfection. The battles are just in tensed than there are in Saving private Ryan but the only thing that separates the two is the comedy. Tropic thunder throws out so many references to many classic war films. There all obvious to notice.The whole idea of not knowing that there actually fighting against rebels is just pure class. There are so many one liners that are hilarious and are guaranteed to stick in your head for weeks to come. The characters are also very funny. The best acting obviously going to Robert Downey Jr. he deserved his Oscar nomination. But the man that steals the show is tom cruise. He may only play an minor cameo but the guy is just hilarious. The acting is class, the film is shot with class. Everything is class .",8,0,1,27 November 2009
Resident Evil," Resident evil
","funnily enough, my interested faded once the zombies arrived. The opening was chaotic, bringing you into the film immediately and the introduction of Alice up too the zombies was interesting. The vibe which the hive generated - a feel of imminent doom inside chrome walls, set up the rest of the film well. Now, it suffered in the character sector. The most important necessity in a horror is a strong group of characters; even more so than the frights themselves. Alice herself is weak and unlikable while the armed forces sent to investigate the hive also lack any charismatic flair. Take Michelle Rodriguez's character for example. Her chronic crumpled face syndrome did nothing but cheer me on for her to die.Resident evil might of been the film to bring the zombies craze to the 21st century, but after watching similar celluloid's such as 'The walking dead' I can only feel obliged to hate on the style in which is used to create a sense of rapid danger for the hordes of zombies. The jagged, blurred style of motion used does nothing but weakens the suspense. I feel that they've failed at creating any fear towards the zombies. Add the awful characters and we're left with the action which is frankly dull. They might as well be shooting at...Well,a bag of bones in all fairness , as the lack of appeal & emotion involvement with the guys down in the hive leaves me wishing that they take there shooting down to the target range.There are some good moments to be watched: the lasers and the dogs. And The opening 45 minutes lived up to it's billing. However, for a horror/action film, Resident evil is tame.",5,0,2,16 February 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," ' do you wanna be like me , or do you wanna be me'
","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. It one of those films that pulls you in right at the start . The cinematography is just beautiful with so many unforgettable and iconic shots that you could hang each and everyone of them up on your walls as a piece of art. I've never been a massive fan of Brad Pitt , only when he working with Fincher do i enjoy him. But now, I just can't get his portrayal of Jesse James out of my head. he doesn't talk a lot but you know what he thinking , he forces you to dive deep into his mind , into his daunting world . This is thanks to the brilliant acting and writing. When it comes to his assassination, the suspense almost becomes unbearable and truly upsetting . We all know it going to happen but we never prepare ourselves for it.Cassey Affleck steals the film for me. When as Robert Ford , some will either hate him or sympathised for him. There every reason to call him a coward , In the law of the American citizens , shooting someone behind their back was proved to be act of cowardice. This is from a guy who Had to endure being laughed at due to his obsession with the James boys , being the the third child in which he states as the forgotten child . He may not become famous as a outlaw but he sure will become iconic when he is known as the guy who killed the almighty famous Jesse James. This is what he believe. When he sends a telegram informing the authorities that he has carried out the assassination with that grin of his face , you just can't prepare your self for the raw powerfulness of the final 20 minutes that is about to come.The last minutes of the film pulls out every emotion from you . There one thing that ties this film together and that is the poetic narration. His voice is calm yet daunting. It adds that extra depth of emotion into the film . Without it then this film wouldn't of been as good. There no such thing as a perfect film but this one comes mighty close. The art design the choice of camera shots, dialogue, costumes, every scene, every word, nothing is out of place. There not one scene which you will dislike . The soundtrack is another vital aspect of the film. The lighting , just to end the list, every single person who worked on this succeeded at using every bit of their ability into making this fine film. One of the best films from the last decade",10,1,2,30 August 2010
The Pianist," Daunting film.
","The pianist is like no other Holocaust film. Polanski doesn't hold back on the horrific accounts that the Jewish Poles were put through. The setting and the cinematography is breath taking. The scenes in which the main character strolls through the empty ruins of homes is nothing less that chilling.the first half of the movie is what you would expect from a film that's telling tales from the holocaust era. Beginning with us watching and listening to the pianist, the Germans soon move in and the expected visual atrocities will be executed with defining accuracy. Some scenes are based solely on true events that Polanski was apart off as a child. Inevitably, The Pianist is going to be compared to Schindler's list and on terms off grittiness and nuance, The pianist wins by a faint margin.One thing that bugged me were the false caricatures of the Nazi's. Yes there were some who were sadists but to label them all with that term is wrong. I say this because every Nazi you see either shoots someone cold blooded or obeys orders showing no sort of remorse. A little winch or a blinker of eye would be enough for me to rule out that this film is not trying to portray all Germans evil. Of course you have the one German towards the end but before that, the film fixated on a biased track.Everything is told through the eyes of the Pianist and while will watch him struggle for survival through the Years, we never gather much personal characteristics of the man. All we know is that he loves the Piano and music is what keeps him going. So might argue that there a barley no story is focus on and there right. We watch him fight for his life and that enough fuel to keep this film rolling.Brody put huge amount of effort and personal sacrifices to make sure he meticulously fulfils this role in a nobly manner. there's fewer lines than the average film but His appearance and his subtle expressions is enough to draw you in and feel for the guy.This films ticks most of the right boxes to be rightly considered as a classic. Acting top notch and same said for the art direction and cinematography. Biased as it may be, it not a biography on the Nazi's crimes but a film that tells a true tale of a man who hid and fought for survival. Must see.",7,0,1,5 April 2011
28 Days Later...," Nothing special
","It alright i suppose. Just, alright. It gritty which is good and also chilling. Seeing London empty is chilling. In fact the first half of the film does enough to keep you hooked. The second half unfortunately is just plain daft. The atmosphere was the only thing that kept me watching. The church scene and the cafÃ© sums up how spooky this film got.The acting was fine. Only negative is the child actor who it seems, was reading her lines by being printed on the wall behind the camera. The pacing was fine and the story of four uninfected humans trying to make it up north to a military camp was engaging. Thinking about, the whole film should of focused itself on there journey up to the camp rather than totally ruining it in the final act. And this leads me to the final act in which can be summed up by one word, terrible. You are forced to spend twenty minutes of your time by watching an infected thing run around a mansion like a fool. I love the fact that these zombies run at there prey head on rather than limping slowly but at times, especially the last twenty minutes, it made the whole film look daft.Is this film scary? i would say not. Is it fun to watch? At times, yes. Is it a modern day classic? No, for me, easily forgettable and with the last act being either a snooze fest or a barrels of laughs depending on your current mood, i wouldn't force myself to watch it again.",6,0,0,10 December 2010
City of God," City of God
","First of all , this film look beautiful and really captures essence of the slums of Brazil. The pacing is fast, not one scene drags. You can't help but think that this film ripped a massive page on narrative off Goodfellas's book. It also takes some notes from Pulp fiction.The film is equipped with a young and inexperienced cast in which each and every one of them preform there role with sheer brilliance. credits has to go too leandro firmino who portrayal of Li'l Ze is outstanding.While all the technical parts, the editing, music and cinematography were excellent, it felt like the story itself needed more character development especially with Rocket. Even though you hear a lot from him. you don't actually see him on screen that often. While Li'l Ze had many scenes dedicated to him along with Benny, it felt like the main protagonist was pushed to the side leaving the ending some how dry. All in all, the film is very good and well worth the watch. Even if you turned down the volume and turn off the subtitles, you would still get some enjoyment out off it due to the way it looks.",7,0,2,17 September 2010
Insidious," Chilling film
","The concept has been done to death, the delivery hasn't. Ghost stories can end up being cheesy and cheep or they can be a frightening experience if directed with creativity and originality. The film does contain some bone chilling scene and is effective in making sure it sticks at the back of your mind when you lay down in bed.It not groundbreaking by any means but it sure trumps over films recently released in the genre. Unlike other ghost tales, this film is quick off the mark and successfully pulls you in.Also like many other ghost films, the father will always be in a state of denial, belittling the claims of their wife's or children. Agreed, the father in this does seem more approachable and in fact becomes centre of the attention. The first act effortlessly drags you in. Second act leaves you wanting more frights and the final act takes you a surreal journey which some may or may not.Overall, the film achieves its goal on delivering a chilling experience and making sure you don't forget it any time soon after viewing.",7,6,11,10 May 2011
Children of Men," Children of Men
","For once ( well twice ) i actually enjoyed watching Clive Owen. I usually find him extremely boring to watch. Michael Cane, as always, was brilliant. In fact there nothing bad to say about the acting maybe the girl who played Kee could of preformed better. This film is a achievement in cinematography. The scenery is fantastic and the story involving the characters struggle to reach a vital destination is grabbing.there are some fantastic battle scenes which were done in one or two takes. These are brilliant. The camera work is no doubt the main highlight of the film. I felt more involved with the battles, more than Saving private Ryan. The nice little touch of blood on the lens, the hand held movements, brilliant.the film looks greats and feels great.",7,1,10,16 June 2010
Donnie Brasco," Donnie Brasco
","Due to his long term Collaboration with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp name is mostly highlighted next to films which bare the Disney indent. However he has acted in films targeted at a older demographical group and Donnie Brasco is one of those films.One word of advice, if your expecting a full blown Mafia film then this film will upset you. We follow the true story of a FBI agent who for Six years, is thrown in the deep end of the Mafia , participating as a undercover cop. The pairing of Depp and Pacino is fantastic with Pacino as always being top dog. However, if your thinking his character Lefty is at the calibre of Michael Corleone or Tony Montano, they you would be very mistaken. Instead, we witness a man whom looking over his shoulder 24/7, afraid of being whacked. A man who has pipe dreams like the rest of us. Despite his Mafia history, you engaged in some sort of supportive connection with Pacino character and hope at the end that things will work out fine for him.With his one liners and old dog's tales, He steals the show. Depp with him only helps the pairing to be even more enjoyable. It still has the night clubs and the 70's soundtrack. There the rare Drug deal but overall, the film focuses on Brasco's partnership with Lefty and his struggle to balance his family life with his job. A very good film",7,0,1,27 April 2011
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," S.T.A.R.S ( only five sadly.)
","Compared to the first film, Apocalpse does nothing different except taking the viewers out onto the streets of Racoon city. Fans of the video games will be glad at the arrival of Jill Valentine and even more so the creation of nemesis. But taking these two characters sway from it all, Apocalspe still gives fans plenty of moments to click their fingers and remember exactly where they have seen the current action on screen before in the games. Sadly though, as a follow up, proceeding with the immediate events after the pandemic outbreak being released from the hive, the film just doesn't do enough to bring you into the story.The problems mirror the ones in the first film: Poor characters, terrible action and a loutish villain. Likewise with the lasers and opening of the first, Apocalypse can boast at delivering some cool moments like the havoc being caused from Nemesis' turret, ( just hearing him grunt the words 'stars' was enough to make me smile)and the chaos surrounding the city; yes, Racoon city makes for a better atmosphere than the underground hive.So overall, the film suffers the same problems that can be found in the first film. It gives fans nostalgic glasses to wear but to sum things up, it's an average film for the ones who want to watch an horror/action",5,1,3,17 February 2013
From Dusk Till Dawn," Two films for the price of one
","Two brothers are on the run from the cops and after finally getting over the border and into Mexico, they decide to stop the night at a remote nightclub. This sentence easily describes the opening half on the film. With Taratino's flick-of-the-tongue dialogue, the first half plays as a great crime thriller. The two brothers , Seth and Richard played by Clooney and Taratino are a interesting pair. Clooney plays the head brother in which he calls all the shots while Taratino plays the sex offender and i have to be honest, his image suits the role. His acting on the other hand is not all to great.Despite Taratino only writing the script for this film, it clearly obvious that he helped with the directing. For example the opening scene in the diner and the Trunk shot at the motel. Then comes Keitel who plays the father who has lost faith in God after the passing of his wife. As always, keitel delivers.The second half turns out to be rather different than the first half. They stop by at a nightclub in which a man welcomes everyone by screaming out a selective list of all types of Pussy. here, we start to meet even more interesting bizarre characters. Danny Trejo as masculine Razor and Tom Savini as the Sex Machine. These two brings more fun and excitement into the film and keeps it rolling without it running out of stream.The last half an hour goes like this: most bikers and truck drivers turn into vampires making themselves a huge threat towards the two brothers and the other normal beings. What we get is Over the top gore which will make you chuckle the first time but after a while begins to get repetitive. As always, we get some great one liners thanks to taratino and basically it all good, gory fun.Some may find this sudden flip hard to take in but if you stay open minded then you should enjoy this film. Seeing George Clooney play this sort of character was a joy and he was most certainly the star of the show. Everyone gave great performances except taratino who just seemed of the ball ( what is up with him and feet?) Overall, your getting two movies in one.",7,0,0,5 July 2010
Paranormal Activity," lower the budget, higher the realism
","you have to take this movie for what it for. it cost 15 thousands dollars to make and only consists of two main actors. the whole film is shot in one house, under one roof. the terrors all happen in one room, the bedroom. What makes the film terrifying is the low budget of it. Everything feels real. you can only create this atmosphere by using an low price camera and production. If you ever watch you tube videos of ghost and demons , then you will know the chilling effect it has on you compared to these horror films today that use special effects that are worth millions to try and scare us. this film however makes a door slam seem horrific.you will either find it scary or not scary at all. If you believe in the paranormal ( like me ) then this film will be scary as hell but if you don't then this film is not for you. For instant, the getting dragged out bed scene, that alone is just terrifying. all the terror happens at night, where the couple leave an camera running through the night hoping to gather evidence or for the man's sake, for coolness. This is where the film is successful. it leaves you wanting more of the night time horrors just like SAW, when you always want to see one more trap. the bedroom is the one place we feel safe but the director totally demolishes that safety.The acting was good all the way through. Some may complain about the pace but i found it just right, letting you build the suspense. One thing i loved was that is was believable. there was no cheesy spirits or effects or unbelievable attacks. This is thanks to the low budget which keeps the realism. But then this leads me to the thing i hated the most and that the ending. It reminded me of some you tube video when an amateur shows off his cheesy effects. There is another ending which i heard of which sounds much believable.What i suggest is that you watch it alone at home because at the cinema the scary scenes are ruined by the laughter and screaming of teenagers when really it needs to be complete silence for the film to have it's full effect. But i warn you, when your in bed at night, the faintest noise will take you back to that room and will send a chill down your spine while you feel something under you bed sheets",8,0,1,30 November 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," No real spice of substance
","I had mix feeling after watching this and at times during it. Bascally it a love story mixed with sci fi. You could easily perceive this film as cheesy and ridiculous. The whole concept of angles dressed in 1940s noir wondering the streets of new york with dairy books in glued to their hands can be considered to be Far fetched.The love element is fine. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt make a fine couple and the romance between them isn't mushy. The film runs at a steady pace with only the ending seeming rush. These angles who duty it to make sure that everyone stays on the right path in life, spend most of their time running after Matt Damon and failing to keep him a way from Blunt.The Ending was a let down. Of course it all worked out for the couple but a more negative ending would of been more suited and brought a uniqueness to the film. Instead we get the most predictable ending Hollwodd could of made up.Overall, Adjustment Bureau is a entertaining film with fine acting. If you take the concept for what it worth then no doubt you will enjoy it.",6,1,2,27 March 2011
Avatar," good....but thats all
","It clear that the only reason people went out to see avatar is because of its ground breaking technology. The film in the visual department does not disappoint . The scenery is fantastic and the 3D is great. But there is a downside , after 30 minutes of seeing the effects , you kind of lose interest. Now and then something will 'wow' you but that about it. The script does not help the film in anyway. It has only been written as a template to show off these effects and nothing else. The story is weak and been told many times before and the characters didn't connect with me. Before I watched Avatar , I heard about the story being similar to other films . I didn't mind this as films are made to be a visual experience and seeing that this is new high technology equipment that Cameron used I surely thought that would be enough to carry me through the film. Apart from the script , there's nothing negative about the film. At the end of the day it goes down to how spectacular the film is. Cameron wanted this film to excite people and it certainly did but just not me. It seems Cameron doesn't care about using his writing abilities anymore and only thinks about the technical side of the industry which is a shame because Cameron can write amazing stories such as The Terminator's films. But you can't blame him for getting everyone out of the house to watch this film. Many people will be interested on how he did it and plus it all good for the cinema world. Should it win the best picture at the Oscars? I would say yes due to the amount of work that has been put into it and how Cameron is trying to reinvent the way we watch films. Personally , I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. My reason being because a film that is categorised as a masterpiece has to stand the test of time. What will happen when all films uses this sort of technology? Avatar maybe the first but when everyone gets there hands on it, other films will start to outclass it. For the cinematic experience , it wasn't greater than the lord of the rings trilogy. You could feel the atmosphere , not only on the screen but all around you in the theatre. Avatar failed to capture that feeling personally. Well Avatar is a good film , it not and will never be a classic to me. I didn't leave me with tons to say after I watched it as it wasn't that good of a film. Tell me, how long can you have a discussion on Avatar before running out of things to say? Not long I bet. Take the 3D away and it leaves you dry",7,1,3,25 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," A much needed horror
","Before I start, I totally thought that this was an serious horror film. I'll probably blame the misleading marketing for that. Despite being filled with clichés , drag me to hell was still an good film worth watching.Instead of an serious horror, it was more of an comedy filled with cartoon violence. This is not an film that takes it self to seriously. The gore and violence is fun to watch , often making you laugh. For instant , when the gypsy eyes pop out . There are many scenes like these. Now, when the film obviously doesn't take itself to seriously , you can't rate it by it plot but instead by it entertainment values. The plot is simple and has been done before many a times. A girl gets cursed, seeks for help, finds solution , twist ending, the end. Now if the film took itself seriously, then you would have the right to complain about the unimaginative plot . But despite the concept being simple, the direction id delivered well. Not once does Raimi lets you settle, the film is filled with pop up scares. But many of these scares aren't just the simple draw-back-curtain-and-boo-scares, instead there well created, for example, the car park scene when the gypsy reveals here self inside the car, very spooky.The film is often humorous , but at times frightening . Raimi builds up suspense and then out of nowhere , delivers the frights. But the best thing about the film is that it was much needed. This decade hasn't been the best for horror films , with only SAW ( first one ) being the only exceptional film so far. Drag me to hell only concentrates on frightening the audience , reminding us why we watch horrors. I watched this on DVD but I can imagine how more suspenseful and frightening the film would be at the cinema. If your getting your mates round yours for the night and thinking of watching an horror, I highly recommend drag me to hell",8,0,2,14 November 2009
The Happening," cheese and crackers
","Holy cheese and crackers, Can film making ever get worse than this? Yes.. yes it can. The happening is a film that does get picked on and i can see why, the acting is terrible and shocking when you read the cast list. Mark Wahlberg seems to be lost, i don't even think he's trying to act because his performance is just awful. But it must be said, without him, this film would be a total disaster. Zooey deschanel is on the same level as Mark in this film. At half the stuff she said and how she delivered it, made me cringe. You know what, no point discussing the acting because there are more serious faults to pick on.What people have to remember is that this film was made from a man who brought us films such as 'signs' and ' lady in the water' so you have to expect some over the top plot. The story is simple, plants communicate to one another and release toxins as a self defence mechanism. basically these toxins force people to commit suicide. I have no problem with the concept, i for one, rather liked the idea. But what really ruined the film was how it was written.Some parts will make you laugh, some parts will force you to roll your eyes, some parts will make you want to do the same actions as the victims commit. There are some stupid one liners. The private's reaction to the dead bodies ' cheese and crackers'. Elliots brainstorming ideas when in the distant , guns shots can be heard. This particular scene ain't helped by the awful acting of Deschanel. Then there's the whole science class scene in which if there is ever a poll on the ' top 10 worst teachers' then Mark wahlberg will no doubt be number one. the whole class discussion is just pointless. To be honest, Mark acts like a clueless hillbilly.The only positive is that the concept, even though it daft, is a interesting one. But when a black kid pops up from nowhere and starts discussing other people's personal matters , then the whole film is ruined.But holy cheese and crackers, the last acts was painful. before this, the film was already on it knees, crawling to the end and the final act was just the beheading. Awful, lousy ending to a lousy film. Shyamalan stated that 'the happening' was made as B movie. Well, to me, that a poor excuse . he also said how he believed the audience would figure out that the ' The Happening' is a supposed B movie. I'm sorry, but when you include already established actors and a serious sense of tension, it easy to know that your clearly lying.With a film that has great actors and a great director, it pretty scary to see how disastrous a film can turn out even when it filled with talent. If the script was solid and if anyone actually bothered to read the script, then this film would of been great.",3,2,4,24 May 2010
Rosemary's Baby," Good, but no masterpiece
","This film led to an different direction than I expected. Not knowing very much about the film , I thought it was going to be extremely dark and eerie. For an horror film, it contains very little horrifying scenes . But saying this, the film instantly grabbed my intention.More of an supernatural thriller, Rosemary baby starts off very much like an soap opera, starting off with an couple finding an apartment, inviting guests for dinner. Nothing particular horrifying so far. But the scene that I see Rosemary baby being known by is the hallucination part. The first scene that makes you feel uncomfortable. No doubt is this the best hallucination I've seen so far in any film. It was chilling and eerie. Not once do you believe Rosemary is safe. Polanski creates the perfect atmosphere. Just like Rosemary, you feel trapped and surrounded by monsters all the way through the film.The acting is top notch. Mia is brilliant as Rosemary and Cassavetes plays the perfect husband. But its Ruth Gordon who shines. At first I found here rather annoying but as the film progresses you come to accept here and enjoy here character , who always liven up the scenes .Even though the film is great is watch , it can come tedious and slow . This mainly because after half an hour, you know who's who . I guessed the ending very early on. Despite all the positives , it not a film which I would want to watch again and again . I could watch it a second time but it not that great.",7,0,0,9 November 2009
War of the Worlds," War of the worlds
","I've watched this film several times over the past years and I've always enjoyed it. The arrival of the Tripods has to one of the most unforgettable Sci-Fi scenes ever. Yes there are some stupid errors but once there up, the film doesn't give you time to rest.Tom cruise was excellent. Not a huge fan of his but you have to give him credit for putting with his son, the biggest idiot in any film I've ever seen. But no,as a average father who is separated from his kids during normal living, he played his role well. His son Robbie could and probably has, make viewers rage out of their seats at his stupidity. Stupid for leaving and stupid because if he remained with his father, he would off witnessed and been part off taking down a tripod via frag while being as close as he could. The irony. Also many complains about the screaming coming from Franning. Yes, annoying but a child would react in that sort of frantic manner.The feeling of impending doom is always looming low above the family while making their endeavour to Boston. Some moments are frightening (basement and the plane scene)while others are total chaos (ferry). An all round god film",7,0,1,5 February 2012
There Will Be Blood," Let me start by saying
","This is defiantly the type of film you need to watch twice to fully appreciate it. On my second viewing , my opinion totally changed.. for one, I thought the soundtrack was brilliant. Just one of many things that makes the film stand out amongst the rest . Again, Daniel day Lewis puts in another tremendous performance. This guy, in my opinion is the best in the industry .This is my first Paul T Anderson film I watched and most likely won't be the last . Many people complain about the pace of his films , how there to slow. Maybe some scenes in There will be blood are a little bit slow but why moan when you have the soundtrack, the track that tells the story by itself without needing the characters to say a word . Why moan when every scene looks fantastic and why moan when its DDL portraying Daniel Plainview. I could watch this man doing nothing but facial expressions all day. He doesn't even need to speak , his body movement and facial expressions tells the story alone.The film also contains many scenes that makes it stand out. Scenes such as the oil tower being on fire, Daniel baptise and then there the ending scene in the bowling hall. The scene has been spoofed many times but even when taken seriously , you still have to laugh at Daniel insanity. I see this film as the modern days Citizen Kane and I will rank Daniel Plainview as the greatest movie character this decade and also in the top 100 of all time. For those who haven't watched it, I suggest you do, for those who watched it only once, I highly suggest you pull out an second viewing and for those who have watched it dozens of time , keep watching it.Now let me end by 'I'm finished'",9,2,4,16 November 2009
Man on Fire," A emotional ride
","This film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter , anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this film. From start to finish this film is immensely captivating. The plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown In the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. Washington as always puts on a great performance.The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. Doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there. For instant, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. The characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great. Mexico City feels alive , it looks like Mexico city, it smells like Mexico city. Everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico CityThis is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. There enough action to keep you happy, there enough character development to please you and then there's Washington to bring a smile to your face . Watch this film, you won't be disappointed",8,13,15,1 February 2010
Con Air," OK, just OK
","I've heard numerous people saying that Con-Air is their favourite film of all time. Hearing this time after time, i finally decided to watch it when broadcast on the box.I was expecting the same quality of other classics action films from the 90s like die hard. Sadly however, this doesn't even stand close of it in terms of overall viewing.Nicholas Cage, for all the things i love him for, was at times, annoying. I'm not one to judge the accent but either ways, truly annoying . The concept was brilliant and there were some great characters, mainly the convicts. I most interested in watching these baddies killing and blowing stuff up than watching Cage trying to make it out alive to see his wife and daughter again.The shootout at the deserted airfield deserves merits and the final showdown between Cage and Cyrus was great. The ending on the otherhand, best not to go there but totally understandable with the song choice seeing that this was made in the 90s.There are some riveting moments ( and some darker moments ) that makes con air enjoyable. My expectations were perhaps set up to high. good to watch on Saturday night.",Null,0,0,15 October 2011
The Reader," Had potential
","Let start off by saying that the first half an hour isn't very captivating . It mainly consists of an woman in her thirties having sex with an minor. If you want to keep engaged with the film, then just try and guess the next sex position they'll be in . This is the first Thirty minutes in an nutshell: sex, read, sex ,read, more sex, read, sex, etc. This could be enough for many views to just turn the film off at this point. The first half is immensely boring.But there still hope. The second half becomes more engaging and turns into the film which you would call a good standard drama. There are some emotionally scenes but there not a lot to say. Its mediocre. Now what confused me the most when watching THE READER was , how on earth did Kate Winslet win an Oscar for this. I'm not criticising here acting as I believe she is an very good actress but here performance in this film was very weak. Still an good performance mind you, but when you know she won an Oscar for it, you expect something more breath taking. The acting was all great, there nothing you can shoot down about it. Mainly it was the direction that was poor as the first half an hour was unnecessary.The film took a while to take off and when it did it was too late. Poor directing lead to the film being boring and not very captivating . It had potential but sadly it an film that you soon forget when the end credits start rolling",5,0,3,18 November 2009
Hancock," Unorthodox superhero becomes somewhat orthodox and boring
","What starts off as a lot of fun, ends with being corny. Hancock is more of your unorthodox superhero. With mega strength at his disposal, he can do pretty much what he wants. Will Smith once again is great. He done many summer blockbusters before and his performance and the overall film keeps up the tradition of raking in a lot of cash. The film itself is entertaining. Towards the end , it hard not to become disinterested.With all the Marvel and graphic novels adaptations being shot for the big screen, it was a breath air to be treated to a light hearted superhero flick. The first half contains laughs and you're never quite sure what Hancock's is going to do next to upset the community.But, when we reach the scene when we discover there more than one person who are gifted with unbelievable strength, it becomes tiresome. The whole love story and the tale of Hancock's past seems lazy and tricks you to believing you've somehow inserted a second disk.If i ever watch Hancock again, i will do so but only the first half. I saw myself avoiding the screen in an attempt to block out the awful love story. Shame, if only they kept the drunken Hancock all the way through the film, more people would of appreciated it uniqueness and no doubt have a higher rating",6,1,3,9 April 2011
Inception," Easily understandable yet so easy to get lost.
","Inception, another film surrounded by huge hype but doesn't fulfils my expectation. The film is undoubtedly very good but just not that good. The main question that many asks before watching Inception is, 'Is this film intelligent'. The answer is simply yes but also no. The story is original but you don't need a I.Q above average to fully understand this film. There just a lot of information thrown into the film that if one loses concentration he may easily find himself lost. But if you keep up with everything then the film is rewarding and simple.The acting is what you expect when you read the casting list. Dicaprio does a fine performance and is defiantly maturing. But there one main problem, the characters are hard to like. You don't hate them or love them but instead just listen to them talking about lots of things for two and half hours and eventually you can't help but wish the film will end. The shootouts were dull with very little creativity put in them. In fact the whole last act dragged far way to long.For me Inception is above average thriller. I can't see myself pulling the DVD off my shelve and encouraging people to watch it in years to come. There a lot of information being thrown at you and it extremely easy to lost your footing. Inception as a novel would of been an best seller but as a film, it rather messy.",6,2,4,9 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes
","I've never read any Sherlock Holmes book or even watched any other TV or and films adapt ions so i'll have to rate the film standing alone. First of all, Downey mumbles it such a low key croak that words are heard to pick up. Nevermind, his character was likable enough.The first 45 minutes, it seemed that Guy Ritchie focused entirely on character development and that the chemistry between Law and Downey, that he totally forgotten about the story. The art design was second from none and the atmosphere was dismally morbid. These two elements juxtaposed very well with the story that soon begins rolling after those 45 minutes As you expect, everything is top notch. Acting, writing, costumes and designs, everything. But me not being a Holmes fan, i didn't rate it much",5,1,2,23 January 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Number one for a reason
","What can be said that already hasn't been. Shawshank Redemption is a spectacular film which focuses on Hope and fear. Morgan Freeman does what he always does, delivers a fine, unforgettable performance. With a voice like that it extremely hard too. As Red, Freeman narrates the tale of how a man wrongly accused of Murder, is sent to life in prison and has nothing but hope to cling on.Stephen King epitomise great storytelling. You don't need twists every scene nor do we need a complex plot that tries to hard to stand out. With colourful characters and fantastic interactions, a story can truly become personal. OK, many here has probably never been sent to prison for something they didn't do but this doesn't stop anyone from imagining the fear and hopelessness that one must go through when stripped from their freedom and rights.There only few films out there that makes the most out off every shot. Shawshank is one of those. There not one wasted second, no scene which could or should of been cut from the final version. Everything is done to perfection. You can feel and sense the delinquency and effort put into the film which luckily for us, makes the viewing that extra special.Pointless it may seem, writing a review for a film which has already been critique to death, but heck, a little more praise won't do any harm. Yes, you will get your snobs who will bang on about how this film doesn't deserve to be number one, but those are the ones who believe a story must be plagued by thought provoking twists. All i have to say is that Shawshank is a heart warming tale that will no doubt leave you in a fuzzy ball of warmth and amazement when the credits begin to roll down on this extraordinary tale",9,1,1,10 May 2011
Centurion," Great for guts and gore but nothing else
","Centurion lack in story and for this suffers a lot. Anything that stars Michael Fassbender is worth watching and as always, he does no wrong. The battle scenes are devilishly beautiful. Maybe to much guts and bones for a 15 but for thankfully, this film takes no prisoners.One Third of the film consists of these battles which is fantastic as the story rails out in a slow tedious fashion. Rescue leader, let him die, escape the high mountains. Nothing to it . The last twenty minutes becomes almost too Hollywood esquire.One encounter which you will look forward too is the fight betwenn Fassbender and Kurylenko in whom, does a great job as the mute. The battle scenes are fantastic but unfortunately, doesn't make up for the non-existent story",6,1,3,5 January 2011
Halloween," Just another gem from the 70's
","This use to be my favourite film of all time when I was only 11 . But as time progresses , I have lost huge interest in Halloween, in fact it been years since I thought of watching it again. After watching it again, it still clear that Halloween is still one of my favourites and one of the greats of the horror genre. The whole film is based hugely on voyeurism, not in an perverted way, but from the eyes of an evil man ( if you can call him man) who is obsessed of killing an specific type of person. In this case, the killer in this film only has one thing in mind, to kill his sister.The film mainly takes place in an small town. Once the film takes you to this town, there no escaping . The horror takes place on one street, between two houses. This is what Carpenter does best, trapping the audience within this small space. What makes the film terrifying is the thought of being watched . Throughout the film , Laurie ( Lee Curtis) is being freaked out by an figure which she keeps seeing. At the first , she suspicious but as the Halloween night progresses , she gets one scare to many . This is not one of those films which the killer just jumps out and kill, giving the audience an slight shock. In Halloween, each death is built up with tension . Often the killer is seen in the background, signifying that he hunting his prey.There are many things that make Halloween memorable. One of them is Donald Pleasance as Dr Loomis. The one who only knows the true terror of the killer. His Description of Myers in the Myers house is one of the biggest highlight of the film. Then there the opening sequence which consists of an POV shot from an Six year old boy's eyes. For the first time, the audience is put in the killers shoes. There's also the last twenty minutes which in my opinion is one of the greatest finale in horror history. Then to put the icing on the cake, to add a little more terror is the chilling soundtrack which today is highly recognisable.Halloween is an complete package. It was the biggest horror film since Psycho. It reinvented the horror genre and also invented the slasher genre. Halloween remains one of the greatest horrors of all time and is a must see",9,1,4,4 November 2009
The Woman in Black," Here comes the woman in black
","To start off, i will say that this film is beautifully shot. Set design and atmosphere is created wonderfully. Now, all we need to make you pee your pants is a truly frightening story. It is a common ghost story; a story i love so much but i can't put in words how much i was bored in the delivery.After viewing, the film leaves you in a baffled state of mix emotions. Do you cuss and throw your arms in the air at the hallow execution or do you shrug your shoulders and appreciate the visual treat the film had provided you. That, or just laugh at the miscasting off Daniel Radcliffe. Him attempting to play a father is like Glitter trying to pull off a loving father role.Daniel isn't a very good actor sadly and his role consists of him strolling the hallways with a lantern while looking perpetual depressed. As hard as it is to make people frightened today, it doesn't unlock the over-usage of jump scares on the audience. Cheap and tacky; only helps to downgrade the film into another rubbish modern horror film.",5,2,3,17 April 2012
Identity," First half=boring Second half=great
","Now i must warn you that the first half of this film is an chore to get through. In fact i was thinking of turning the damn thing off but if you keep on watching , the film begins to pick up the pace and the plot becomes more diverse . This not the best thriller every but it contains its own original twist. The setting is perfect. An motel placed in the middle of nowhere. The director captures the atmosphere well with the constant raining and lightning adding more of an effect. Sure these two elements are always being used but there nothing wrong with that.The actors carry out there roles reasonable well. there no exceptional performance from anyone but you don't expect that from this type of film. Now for the twist, a lot of people struggle to understand it. Personally , it not all to complicated to follow. If you know about split personalities then the conclusion shouldn't be to hard to understand.Some negatives is that the ending is easily predictable. It doesn't keep you guessing but instead wondering if the whole plot ties together. Also there no artistic value to it. When you are told of what is really happening you will begin to wonder if the director could of added more depth to the world rather than basing it in another typical world .But still the film is enjoyable to watch and one which you'll be talking about after it finishes. The first half is rather boring but the second half comes to life . If you love thrillers then this is an film for you",7,0,5,16 December 2009
Final Destination," treasure every step
","The night before i viewed this film, i watched the latest final destination, the 2009 version. While that one was your typical , god damn awful teen horror flick, the original has more going for it and is packed with entertainment value.First of all, the characters aren't wooden. None of them come out with any ridiculous one liners like they did in the 2009 film. All the actors played there part well. The only problem with the characters was that not one of them was likable. Even though the plot is similar to the latest version, this one doesn't seem to be to much over the top. When i say this i mean that the deaths aren't far fetch and aren't only use to portray the gore element of the film like in the latest version. In the original, the deaths are believable while at the same time there filled with gore.The opening of this movie is great. the airport scene is filmed great and the special effects are brilliant. i don't know anyone who would turn the film off after the first 20 Min's. For once in the genre, the film gives an great script, good acting, original plot. This film rises above the rest within the teen horror genre. The only negative is that the ending is totally predictable, it quite easy to spot the characters making the mistake in there judgement. Overall this is a good film that deserves to be watched at least once. It a film that by far beats the rest, that is mostly junk, out there.",7,1,2,15 January 2010
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One, two....
","What i love the most about Nightmare on Elm street is the realism that the film pulls off; whether if dreaming or not. Now,a hideous man with blades for fingers who kills you in your dreams isn't exactly reality but everyone dreams and experience nightmares and Wes Craven in this film pulled off creating a tense and dreary atmosphere during the dream sequences. Total contrast compared to the sequels where the dreams become over imaginative and cheesy.By no means is it scary when watching it today - unless you're below the age of 10 - but from start and finish the whole experience is thrilling. 'Halloween' brought you indefatigable suspense, 'Friday the 13th' gave is a twist and ' Nightmare on Elms' brought us a original and timeless concept.If you know who Freddy is - like many folks do - but have never watched a film of his, then please cleanse yourself from the sin of eluding the film for so long and watch it.",8,0,1,15 April 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Admired the concept but the film as a whole fails
","I'm pretty disappointed about this film. The first hour was bland to say the least with only the scenes involving the two geezers in the white shirts making me intrigued. But even then, i felt if the humour had been turned up a little bit to much. When it came to the last third of the film, i began to love it. However, my mood fluctuated once more when it came perfectly clear in the last ten minutes how the film was going to end. The reasoning behind the whole concept of the cabin left a sour taste in my mouth.The actors in the film were annoying. The dude with the Bong was unfunny and wished for him to die first. My decree of death swifted over too the blond girl who spent her time futilely making out with a wolf and dancing around in tiny shorts. Yes, I know the whole reason behind the characters but this doesn't change my opinion. The main lead was boring and the geek was invisible for most parts.Another annoying factor is the use of the wrong killers. When I saw what was available too kill, i frowned and thought ' why the hell did they choose the boring zombies and not the monster with blades around his head.' But being in a Cabin, i suppose Zombies makes perfect sense.If you are expecting a typical horror film, then you will enjoy this and will most certainly become baffled about the amount of jokes being told by geezers inside a control room. Ardent Horror fans will love it as it's basically a homage to all horror films and will appreciate the ending.I can praise the concept and the whole idea but i couldn't help but wish they would take out the humour, make it broodier and darker, and create better characters. But then, i'm surely taking out all the fun.",5,14,28,15 April 2012
Gladiator," Tell me your masculine name.
","The film that invigorated the swords and sandals genre once more. To not threaten the brevity of the review by repeating what everybody else already knows, i will sum up Gladitor by writing these words: An epic revenge film set in Roman days.If it's facts your looking for ( and god bless you if so) then don't get upset when history has blatantly been rewritten in order to escalate the viewers enjoyment of the excellent story.This film could easily of ended up being cheesy but thankfully everyone pulls of their roles. R.Scott couldn't of shot it any better. Plenty of action for the bloody-thirsty folks and the main character probably has the coolest name in movie history.",8,2,4,26 March 2013
Goodfellas," Goodfellas
","Goodfellas, a film that immediately grabs your attention and doesn't let go to the final credits. The film runs for almost Two and a halve hours but one would never notice the time racing away due to brilliant structure and narrative. Henry's Narration gives this film a calming effect, he never shouts he just tells the story as if he being investigated by the cops. With the narrative, the films rolls like a dream. The pacing is perfect and not once do you hang around the same scene.In these two hours, you learn how Henry always wanted to be a gangster. He tells you this in the first three minutes of the film. 10 minutes later, he a gangster and from here on, you witness the power and glamour you receive when everyone knows who you are. The acting is brilliant. Ray Liotta gives a outstanding performance while Joe Pesci is steals every scene he in . DeNiro role is not as large as one would like but he still gives a strong presence.The Art design is another brilliant achievement . The world around you is portrayed perfectly that you can't help but be dragged into the setting. This is also helped by the directing which brings great style and editing that the film is like a dream. Overall, a great film",8,0,0,14 August 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne Supremacy
","You know what i love about this follow up? It the fact that it doesn't seem you swapped discs or that you have waited years for it. This film is almost a carbon copy of the first. You have the car chases, the same assembled cast, the discover of Bourne's past. But what the first film executed in terms of action and story, Supremacy doubles it.Why should you watch this film? Simple. If you didn't enjoy film number one, then don't waste your cash. However, if you did enjoy it, even if you didn't highly rate it, then Supremacy is a must see. If you haven't seen the first then it no big deal.instead of walking round europe , dressed up like a college student, Bourne Is always one step ahead of the game. The car chases are amplified and the tension is rigged higher. Nothing much to say except that it a brilliant thriller film",8,1,2,1 April 2011
