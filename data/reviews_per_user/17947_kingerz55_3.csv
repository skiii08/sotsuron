Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Facile pap
","I wrote my university thesis on Sherlock Holmes. This is a crock of rubbish. Hollywood-ized, exaggerated, unbearable trash. It seems to expect us to believe that Holmes is a Matrix-era Neo with super-hero-styled martial arts abilities. Downey could hardly overact more without this film being deemed sheer comedy. Indeed, that would be what this is, were it not so woefully bad. 'Suspension of Disbelief', anyone'? Aye...not even worth a free download. One wonders why anyone would pass this script or agree to act in it. It must just be a cynical hope that some money can be made. The first film had, at least, a slight nod to the brilliant restrained excellence of a TV actor such as Jeremy Brett, in his utterly British, ironic and subtle acting of the detective icon. Downey and whoever acts Holmes (he's too 2D for me to care who he is)simply dissolve into a pap of loud SFX and rushed stereotypical trash. All that is sloppy with modern Hollywood distilled. I give two stars for the waterfall finale with Holmes and Moiraty: that was poignant....sadly undone by a facile ending.",2,8,14,1 May 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Defiant, Dark and Glorious
","*** This Review Contains Spoilers ***Very soon everyone will know what happens at the end of the movie, but if you do not yet, stop reading now and go and watch the film soon. Initial reviews have claimed that Batman is out of character because he kills people and that 'too much happens', or that Lex Luthor is a poor villain. None of this seems true to me at all. The film is a powerful one and had many people crying by the end.Some waited till the final roll of the credits, perhaps hoping for a Marvel-like scene. A few waited because they were not ready to leave. The emotional impact was that great.Flipping the original comic book so that Superman gets buried instead of Batman was brilliance, even down to the heartbeat heard at the close of the film. The Jesus imagery is totally appropriate and links in with Lex's paranoia and discovery of what are in effect 'ancient aliens' who have probably spawned religions throughout time. Brilliant. Yes, the imagery is heavy, but many will not see it otherwise.Anyone complaining that Superman dies should know that this also took place in the comics years ago in 1992.'Too much happens' is simply an odd complaint perhaps, with the caveat that lay-viewers may struggle to follow some elements, such as the identity of Johnathan and Martha Kent, or even the Batman origin story. However, compared to the glorious mess of 'Avengers 2', with heroes popping up all over the place, this was tight and controlled.I think many of the professional critics are making foolish complaints. One objected to 'Justice League' being too-obviously set up in the scene where Wonder Woman opens the LuthorCorp files. Come on! EVERYONE wanted to click on those as soon as Batman opened them! It was great.Complaining that there is 'no humour' is untrue. There are a number of moments that raise a smile, but it seems that some critics just want to see more Marvel movies and Tony Stark-like quips. Such levity is great in those films, but this is not such a movie: it is a Batman film and here both he and Superman come to grips with inner and outer demons. It is defiant, dark and glorious.Lex developed from an autistic-savant-type dotcom billionaire (ironically starting in his 'Social Network' persona, as we all I think dreaded seeing) into a genuinely terrifying being, seeming inhuman himself. The scene where he has the sass to threaten Superman on the roof was tension-to-the maximum.Wonder Woman was less fully drawn but featured far more than expected and seemed strong, defiant and independent. In particular, I could believe she was almost-immortal, because she seemed so distant.Finally, yesÂ…Batman does shoot people, not just in his dream but surely with his vehicles and definitely during the chase scene for the kryptonite. This only seems realistic in out post 9/11 world, some may say, but artistically it positions him nicely against Superman. One kills criminals when he has to: the other kills innocents through collateral damage when he has to. Brilliant.We are very lucky to be living in a time when these films are being made. I can't wait for what is next.",10,5,11,24 March 2016
Warcraft," Really Enjoyable
","Once again I am left stunned at how disconnected these 'professional critics' seem to be. It seems they just like to torpedo films, but scores like 29% putting things like Warcraft and Batman vs Superman below well-known howlers are just bonkers.I played World of Warcraft and so did my 16 year old daughter, whereas my partner never has. We all really liked it.The cinema clearly did too, with cheering at certain points and a really positive vibe.The film pays SO much subtle tribute to the game and its players, yet is accessible to everyone.I am so glad China has made this film a success because it deserves to be. The world of Azeroth and the quirky games set in it deserve it.",10,2,5,18 June 2016
