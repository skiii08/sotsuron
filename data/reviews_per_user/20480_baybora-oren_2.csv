The Avengers," Not so good
","I watched. But I couldn't' t like it very much. This is action movie but i could see action just twenty minutes. Shortly %15 action, %10 mythology %75 dialog. In my opinion; Captain America movie is OK, Hulk movies is OK, Iron man movies OK, S.H.I.E.L.D movie is OK. But hero's team movie avengers is poor than others.This is movie which you can watch in your spare time. 8.6 rating is too much for this movie. it can be around 5 average. Also movie action scenes look like computer game trailer. Movie story is better than movie digitized action scenes. This movie hasn't got story enough.",3,9,18,6 June 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," 'Animal Circus is wonderful' propaganda
","Movie was nice but why that movie is make propaganda about animal circus is wonderful. Also they make fun of cirque du soleil. Really really i didn't like propaganda that animal circus is good. In circus situation is hard for animals. They look like happy but is it real ? What is reality ? They are not in natural habitat, they obey to person who train it. This make me upset, they are not free. These animals not belong to us, they belong to nature. Reality of animal circus, it is not look like madagascar 3, heh ? http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=UCbAH2E9jP4&feature=share i don't accept animal circus, i accept human circus like cirque du soleil.",5,0,1,30 December 2012
