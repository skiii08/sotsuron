The Blair Witch Project," A Fantastic Myth, but it 'BORROWS' from previous a film...
","I enjoyed this film, especially it's original story and presentation. Heather Donahue delivered a fabulous performance, and 'Mike' was very funny. However, I must say that as far as the documentary concept, and including several shots (like the final fall of the camera in the last scene) the film- makers              unashamedly RIPPED OFF the French                 film MAN BITES DOG (1992).That earlier film was about three independent film- makers who follow a murderer on his daily rounds. They soon get tired and frightened of him, and eventually their lighting man is killed. This scene includes a frantic chase up a flight of stairs in an abandoned warehouse, with displacement of sound due to the distance of the sound man. The scene then goes down the stairs into a dark basement, which is lit only by the new lighting man. The final scenes involve the death of all in the crew, including the cameraman, who falls to the ground at a tilted angle. The cam does not move, and we see the empty room, but not the killers. Now tell me if THAT'S not a rip- off.",9,1,1,2 September 1999
Fight Club," Powerful but Flawed
","Edward Norton has a gift for choosing powerful films, and an even greater talent for performing his roles. In 'Fight Club', he does not disappoint. In fact, even Brad Pitt makes a decent showing of it, and the angelic Helen Bonham-Carter completes an impressive trio. Much of the script is darkly poetic, and the direction is fast-paced and in many parts fascinating. However, the initial shock of the plot loses steam about 2/3 in, and the plot becomes a bit muddled. Yes, it is intended to be mysterious and even a bit ambiguous, but somehow a message is lost somewhere in the montage of realization near the end.  Unfortunately there are some short, lame moments of dialogue that seem cut-and-pasted in from other movies, and are glaringly out of place in this off-beat film. In summary I would say that this is an excellent alternative to the typical Hollywood movie, with a powerful message that was ALMOST delivered expertly.",8,0,2,17 October 1999
Citizen Kane," Everyone's missing the point.
","Yes, I understand that this is America, and everyone is entitled  to their opinion, and many like to 'rate' things, trying to figure out who is best, who is second best, etc... Well, yes Citizen Kane has been called #1 on many lists. However, these lists are made by professionals, and they look as much at technical issues as anything else. And they are just lists. Let me say it again, and this applies to everyone's lists, not just the critics' : they are just lists. The great directors, Welles included, do not (and did not) make films to beat out other directors on lists. This is not college football here. This is art. And, it is entertainment. The film has been around for 57 years, and every sort of person has seen it in every sort of way with many different intentions. Therefore, opinions will vary to such a degree that any sort of 'absolute' ranking, comparing it to other films, should be looked at as mere fun, just something to give film lovers something to talk about. If you see this film and you love it, it may be because the plot intrigues you. It may be because you appreciate the innovation of the directing, or simply that you love old movies in black and white! 'Greatness' is relative folks, and I hope you all at least enjoy yourselves a little bit as you make your lists.",9,1,1,4 November 1998
Shakespeare in Love," Why the Titanic comparison?
","I'm curious as to the many Titanic comparisons this film is getting. Besides the many Oscar nominations and the fact that it's a love story, I fail to see any similarities. This brilliant film has fantastic acting, the best screenplay of the year, beautiful directing and costumes, and an emotional impact that lasts. Titanic didn't. (Dramatic pause). Anyway, I am surprisingly pleased with Paltrow, and extremely impressed with the direction and screenplay. This film was funny, fun, interesting, effective, beautiful, and... ok, enough is enough. You get the idea.",9,0,0,22 February 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Who better than Burton for the Horseman?
","Tim Burton was born to make 'Sleepy Hollow'. The Master of Creepiness takes this classic tale and presents it with the expected awesome visuals of any Burton film. The art direction and cinematography are fabulous, and it is fun to see the allusions to his older films (such as 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'Batman'). However, the screenplay dialogue is atrocious, and some of the acting even worse. Depp and Ricci are fine, but some of the more villainous characters seem to have been ripped from a Power Rangers tv show. Still, the Burton Effect is there, and overall the movie works as a classic presentation of a classic tale. This year's Top Films (so far): 1) American Beauty 2) The Insider 3) Eyes Wide Shut 4) Bringing Out the Dead 5) The Matrix 6) *SLEEPY HOLLOW* 7) The Blair Witch Project 8) Tarzan 9) Fight Club 10) The Sixth Sense",Null,0,0,21 November 1999
The Doors," Stone Successful In Creating Atmosphere of The Doors
","Jim Morrison was dead long before I was born, yet I can still feel his angst through his music. I can relate to many of his songs, and I'm not even a drug user. The key to his magic is the atmosphere the songs create. Oliver Stone, who grew up with The Doors, recreates this atmosphere so well that I sometimes feel stoned myself from just watching the film! I don't know if it is accurate, and knowing Stone, it probably isn't. But then again, I don't care. The mood of the film brought through the feeling of what it must have been like to be with The Doors during that rebellious and experimental time. It takes a great talent to transfer the attitude of one decade to another 30 years later. Val Kilmer was absolutely MAGNIFICENT as Morrison, and it only helps that of all living actors he is by FAR the closest look alike to Morrison. Recommended for anyone who wants a night to 'Ride the Snake'.",7,1,1,5 November 1998
Romeo + Juliet," MTV does Shakespeare
","What a sad day it is when the Capulets destroy gas stations and Romeo smokes cigarettes. This new version, in a poor imitation of the 'MTV cross-cutting' style, makes a terrible mess of Shakespeare's classic. The direction is a joke, the editing is ridiculous, and the actors are vacant of any comprehension of the characters. In other words, this is pure trash. See Zeffirelli's 1968 version instead.",4,2,4,30 November 1999
Fargo," The Fourth Type of Movie Watcher
","... And then there's the good ol' FOURTH type of movie watcher: he/she that watches to be entertained AND can appreciate the art of a film. Now, I have NOTHING against the directing abililty of the Coen brothers, even in Fargo... and I certainly thought the acting was very well done. However, the story did not satisfy me, and overall I did not enjoy watching this film. Thus, despite any positives, I can hardly give it a good review. Enjoyment goes a long way in a movie. (Ex: Citizen Kane is an innovative masterpiece, but I would never watch it for fun. That's my opinion. The Third Man is ALSO a directing masterpiece, but I WOULD watch it for fun. It entertains me much more than Citizen Kane.) I try not to label those who liked Fargo as inane or holier- than- thou just because I didn't like it.",5,3,7,28 November 1998
Fargo," Hmmm... no.
","Well, I liked Raising Arizona and Barton Fink a lot. Fargo though... I don't know what to say. It was recommeded to me, and I went in hoping for another great Coen story, and I got... well, nothing much. OK, a little weirdness with those irritating accents, a whole bunch of blood in a few places, but... As you can see, I'm having a tough time coming up with something to SAY about this... BORING piece. I hate to say it, but despite what some have impled, intelligence has NOTHING to do with watching this film, and I am very disappointed. In fact, the Big Lebowski was even worse, and I hope that the last two films are not a sign of deterioration in a previously great Coen  brothers duo.",5,1,3,11 November 1998
American Beauty," Powerful and Disturbing
","This is the darkest of dark comedies, and part of the humor is how the viewer is pulled in and dragged down with the characters. At first, the film seems quirky but funny, with Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning playing a disfunctional but almost cartoon-like suburban couple with a rebellious child. Nothing new there, right? Well, soon it becomes obvious that there is a lot more to it than that, and we are pulled along by a fantastic script as the conflicts emerge. I have never before witnessed such a beautifully accurate portrayal of modern dilemmas. Like much of the 1990's, this film is in-your-face and has no compassion for the light-hearted. Homosexuality, young lust, identity crises, bigots and power-mongers seeth through the film, tearing apart two families and leaving no pure hero, and no obvious villain. We are allowed to see both sides of all characters, and so instead of caricatures, we see real human beings, and so the tragedy of it all hits even harder.",8,0,0,28 October 1999
American History X," Edward Norton: the next De Niro
","Though this story is well told and nicely directed, it is Edward Norton who makes the film as good as it is. Ranging from pre- Nazi school nerd to post- prison adult, with a fabulously scary Neo - Nazi in between, he was well deserving of his Academy Award nomination. Not since early Robert De Niro films have I seen a young actor with such range, potential, and talent. I remember being impressed with his brilliant 'rookie' year, 1996, when he appeared in Everyone Says I Love You, The People vs. Larry Flynt and Primal Fear. Now it seems he has taken the next step towards being one of the great actors. His portrayal of Worm in Rounders was solid, and Derek in AmerHistX is nothing short of brilliant. Look for him in the upcoming Fight Club and his directorial debut next year : Keeping the Faith.",8,0,0,31 May 1999
JFK," It's Amazing...
","It's truly amazing how a film like JFK can stir up so many strongly opinionated responses. An issue such as this (the assassination of a president and the possibility of government conspiracy) is obviously very important to people. Therefore, I think that Oliver Stone was very right in making his film, and making it the way he did. Whether or not you believe him, believe some of what he says, or hate him for all of it, still he makes you think about the event, makes you remember it and become emotional about it (angry, curious, sorrowful, etc.) I think the greatest filmmakers are those who can interest and involve the viewers in their personal statements. Does Oliver Stone hope that everyone will fall for his version? I doubt it. Does he want people to question things? Yes. He wants you to question the events you heard the first time, whether it was on the news, in a history book, or from word of mouth. And yes, even his own accounting of it. The fact that so many people reacted to it means that there is something more to it than a paragraph in a history book. Was it communists? Was it the mob? CIA? FBI? Even LBJ?!? I don't know. I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't bet against it either. THAT'S the point.",9,3,15,11 August 1999
The Piano," The Piano Plays to the Heart
","Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin and Harvey Keitel each deliver perhaps their greatest performances ever. Jane Campion's direction and the magnificent score add to this to present one of the finest films ever made, and perhaps the greatest ever by a woman. I believe The Piano, like many other classics, will be given its due after enough time has passed. I think that the 1990's is the wrong decade for it to receive its full credit, but when the time ripens, it will be seen as one of the best.",9,0,2,5 November 1998
From Dusk Till Dawn," Cult- type fun free for all
","This movie is just plain fun. No comments on technical stuff or acting or whatever, it was just fun to see, and was full of hilarious cult- like one liners that I'm sure many people still have fun with. Just see it when you're in a good mood and go with it.",Null,0,0,4 November 1998
The Insider," Solid, Impressive Film
","This film is powerful and high-charged with tension. Despite a storyline that would appear dull on paper, Mann's direction and the fantastic acting of Crowe and Pacino keep it moving with the dynamics of a 90 minute thriller. Mann has a knack for pulling the human side out of even the most horrible of situations, and here again he shows us high drama and still makes it a character piece. The film deserves Oscar nominations for acting, directing ,cinematography and editing.",8,0,0,5 November 1999
There's Something About Mary," Dumb, Dumber, DUMBEST
","I actually became angry when people in the theater laughed at the childish, underdeveloped gags in this ridiculous flick. Not angry at them because they disagreed with me, but because I live in a country full of underdeveloped intellects. There were ADULTS laughing at this collection of already- done junior high humor. Gross stuff doesn't bother me : I was pleasantly surprised by Howard Stern's movie, and the stuff I talk about with my friends would make Mary fans blush. But this stuff just wasn't funny. Sorry.",3,0,0,4 November 1998
There's Something About Mary," Geoffrey Rush holds the key...
","After seeing this movie, and wondering for months upon months HOW people thought it was so funny, I finally got the answer. Geoffrey Rush, in the masterpiece Shakespeare In Love, explains that, for the inferior, banal common man, there needs to be 'a bit with a dog'. Aha! I thought to myself. There it is! The bit with the dog was the answer. And then I realized that there was more to it. Much like TV laugh- tracks, this type of movie is a conditioned type of humor. Everyone has seen the same trailers, over and over and over again. So, at the theater, they know when to laugh. There are enough of these conditioned scenes to run the laughter over into the scenes that have not been seen. By the middle of the movie, everyone is laughing. Since most people like to be part of a group, they figure they should be laughing as well. From conditioned trailers to the end, it seems that it is a very funny movie. I realize that this is not a conscious endeavor by the viewers : if it was, it wouldn't work. So if you found it funny, I understand that you will not believe me. But aren't you happy now that you can feel like you're part of this group, this little bit of community fun? I'm sure you do. It's your movie now, so you know whenever you want to laugh, you can rent it and be qued to laugh. Very convenient. Just for my sake : please don't laugh too many more times at the dog. It wasn't funny the first time, and after seeing it a dozen times on commercials, it COULD NOT be funny anymore.",3,0,0,31 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick Ends On A Masterpiece
","This film is nothing less than enthralling. Kubrick weaves this brilliant yarn of morality and absorbing visuals with the confidence and mastery of a true cinematic genius. Cruise and Kidman are hauntingly natural, and the supporting cast is wonderful. Here we see the first Oscar contenders for Best Picture, Director, Cinemetographer, and Actress. To comment much on the plot would be a spoiler, and this is a mysterious gem not to be ruined by heresay. My advice : see it.",10,1,2,16 July 1999
Titanic," Not Bad, Not Bad At All
","Ok ok ok... There is nothing wrong with Leo Di Caprio except that us guys wish we had his looks... His acting in Titanic was sub-par, but I've seen him do very excellent jobs in This Boy's Life and Romeo and Juliet, so I can't knock him for one average job. I've also seen Winslet do a better job, despite her Oscar nomination. James Cameron is a great special effects director, and I think some day people will look at him as one of the great influences of 1980's and 90's popular film. I enjoyed the film, although I did not LOVE it, but that's ok. The music was appropriate, if a little overdone, but the romance was great. No, I am not a fan of romance, but obviously for millions of girls out there it was VERY effective. Bravo to Cameron, and if it made more money than some of us think it deserved, well, that's showbusiness!",6,1,1,8 November 1998
The Green Mile," Good but not great
","'The Green Mile' is one of those movies that has an excellent story, gorgeous cinematography, solid acting, and that's all. While there is nothing particularly wrong about the film, neither is there anything outstanding. Perhaps at times it extends too far into comedy, others too far into violence, but it keeps a fair balance most of the time. Although the concept is intriguing, it seems that it is underdeveloped somehow. Yes, the events in the story are all there, but the 'moral' explained at the end does not come across during the action the way I expect the director intended. Michael Clarke Duncan and Tom Hanks give fine performances.",7,0,0,22 December 1999
Any Given Sunday," Who is this guy, and what did they do with the REAL Oliver Stone?
","What a disappointment. Oliver Stone, Al Pacino and football. What a great movie THAT should be. 'Should be' doesn't mean 'IS', however. Unfortunately, Stone's flashy (and yes, impressive) shots of the the game are not enough to solidify this unfocused movie. The movie is wrought with too many music-videos and shallow characters to whom we cannot relate. If Stone wanted to make 'Rudy part II' he should have concentrated more on the characters, and if he was looking for 'MTV does the NFL' he shouldn't have wasted our time even introducing half of the characters. But he ends up in the middle here, with a mish-mash of football-music-videos and underdeveloped characters who have mysterious and quick attitude changes just in time to win a playoff game. The greatest let-down is that the great rebel Oliver Stone sells out and gives us a Rudy ending, without making us care for anyone like we cared about Rudy. Of course we have lots of sentimentality about the past, sure. You want to talk about the past, Mr. Stone? Remember Platoon and JFK? I do.",6,1,1,22 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," It Works
","Look out for Haley Joel Osment. This kid can act. He is so convincingly frightened, so depressingly sad that he pulls Bruce Willis up to his level, even dragging real tears from the tough guy. The directing is excellent, and the cinemetography extraordinarily beautiful for a suspense/drama. The intriguing plot and excellent acting (by Osment and Willis, anyhow) make up for the slow pace. The only standout drawbacks are the acting of Olivia Williams, playing Willis' wife, and an odd fifteen minute transitional sequence near the end in which it seems footage may have been cut to leave time for the fantastic ending. See it and you'll know what I mean.",8,0,0,8 August 1999
The Thin Red Line," Interesting...
","Problem Number One : When writing a screenplay, one should at least attempt to make it possible for the audience to relate to at least one character. In this film, so many shallow and disoriented characters came and went that I was left grasping for someone to like. Ok, so maybe that's very Hollywood of me. Well, then how about - Problem Number Two : - an intriguing plot. I'm not sure this film had a plot. A message, yes. In fact, a very well contructed and beautifully presented message. However, that is not enough to fill a three hour film. Problem Number Three : The excessive and unnecessary cameos. John Travolta and George Clooney were not needed and distracting. Unfortunate is the word that comes to mind. Problem Number Four : The voiceovers and 'memory' sequences. Again, excessive and distracting. Perhaps if we were allowed to be sure who we were rooting for, the memories would have been more effective. But, the focus switched seemingly randomly, and so they didn't work. Nick Nolte was excellent, and the cinemetography was fantastic. Perhaps Malick should watch a few Fellini films before his next attempt at 'art'.",Null,0,0,22 February 1999
