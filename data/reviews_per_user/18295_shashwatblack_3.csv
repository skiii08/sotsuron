Requiem for a Dream," Definitely not for everyone
","I'm glad I finally got around to watching this movie. But I wouldn't call it a 'must watch'. It's a good movie, but at the end I'd been watching at 3x because it felt needlessly long and uncomfortable.",7,0,0,26 March 2018
No Country for Old Men," Wish I could unsee the last 20 minutes.
","Excellent acting, great cinematography, exceptional storytelling. But alas, the story it tells is hollow and pointless.
I so wanted to like this movie. It seemed very promising. The first half was so well executed, I really thought it would end up being one of the best movies I've ever watched.
But the second half just sucks. All the built up suspense, crumbles to dust and leaves the audience hanging.
Like game of thrones, this was easily one of the worst endings ever.(I would actually rate it ~6 or 7 -- my 1 is just to offset these 10/10 reviews.)",1,3,10,2 January 2020
The Greatest Showman," Loved going to the movie after a long time
","Though I'm already biased towards musicals, this movie was an absolute delight. I loved every bit of it. Performances by Hugh Jackman and Zack Efron were very praiseworthy. I thought the arc between Barnum and his father in law took somewhat of a weird turn. That's the only disappointment (minor) I have with the plot. The rest of the movie, the songs, the dances and the circus performances were all amazingly executed. This is a movie I truly enjoyed. Much recommended for everyone.",10,1,3,13 January 2018
