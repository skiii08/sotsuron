Mission: Impossible III," Lacks Finesse Of John Woo
","I have to say it was entertaining enough, considering I thought I'd be throwing my Coke at Tom Cruises gigantic head. Instead I enjoyed the constant adrenaline and the over all plot was pretty good without the cheap sequel feel to it.Cruise was better than he was in War of the Worlds and the supporting cast was also pretty good. (I'm still a bit peeved they didn't give Ving Rhames a bigger part) all in all good cast.Unfortunately with the more interesting character interaction Of J.J. Abrams, comes the drawback that John Woo and his special effects/fight coordinators are not attached. The fight scenes albeit captivating lacked the creativity and awe that Woo's been able to inspire in previous sequel.None the less go out and watch it.",7,0,1,6 May 2006
