United 93," A modern classic !
","I never fancied this film as there is such an overwhelming sense of inevitability about the ending that I felt it would be a depressing chore.However I am so glad that I watched it. It is filmed very much in a documentary style that totally engrosses from the beginning. You know what is going to happen but you want something to change it, a proper search by airport security, the plane to be grounded in lieu of the other attacks etc.The film is genius in that it builds tension from the opening frames and never lets you go. The acting was superb all round and it really humanised the tragedy and the confusion of the day. You are transported to the back of that plane as a passenger and find yourself searching for a solution to the mayhem around you.Amazingly, the film is uplifting in the final frames and finishes just a the right moment. It is already a cinematic classic and a wonderful tribute to all the lost lives that day.",10,2,4,29 December 2006
