The Devil's Advocate," Pacino deserved an Oscar for this role!
","This is one of the best movies of it's kind!  Unfortunately, they cast one of the worst actors in American History to play Kevin!  What a shame! The accent he used, or TRIED to emulate, was just horrible.  Other than that, everyone held up their end and Pacino was absolutely AMAZING as was Charlize Theron!If you're a fan of Horror/Sci-fi/Thriller etc, you owe it to yourself to check this one out!
