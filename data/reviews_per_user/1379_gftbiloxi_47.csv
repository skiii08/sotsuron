Vertigo," The Hitchcock Masterpiece
","As much 'art' film as Hollywood product, VERTIGO was generally savaged by critics upon its release; today it is widely regarded as Hitchcock's single finest film. The story is extremely well known: a retired police detective with an incapacitating fear of heights, Scottie, is engaged to shadow a beautiful woman, Madeline, whose husband suspects her of being suicidal. Scottie soon becomes obsessive about Madeline--but circumstances quickly spin out of control, and his love turns to tragedy and madness.Unlike most Hitchcock films, VERTIGO unfolds slowly, drawing the viewer into the relationship between Scottie and Madeline at the same pace as the characters experience it. At the same time, Hitchcock presents the viewer with a number of visual motifs (such as the famous spirals found in the film) to reinforce the increasingly disturbed nature of the story. As the film progresses, VERTIGO develops a powerfully hypnotic quality rather like the dreamed nightmare of a slow-motion fall.To a certain extent, the stars of VERTIGO are cast against type. This is particularly true of James Stewart, who is best known as the All-American Everyman, and his performance as the increasingly neurotic Scottie is all the more disturbing for our knowledge of his more typical performances. Although usually noted more for beauty than for acting ability, Kim Novack gives a remarkable and extremely believable turn in what is easily the finest performance of her career. The supporting cast--which includes particularly fine performances by Barbara Bel Geddes and Konstantin Shayne--is also excellent, and Bernard Hermann's excellent score adds tremendous dimension to the film.Some viewers, particularly those enamoured of such rapid-fire Hitchcock romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST, may find themselves impatient with the film's leisurely pace; some viewers will themselves unable to see beyond the twists in the script to grasp Hitchcock's statement on obsessive love. But for most viewers--myself included--this is 'the' Hitchcock film, the great masterpiece by a director renowned for masterpieces. A personal favorite, and very highly recommended.Gary F.

Ghost," Corporate Movie-Making At Its Most Predictable
","GHOST hearkens back to films of the 1940s and 1950s which mixed screwball comedy, romance, and suspense with a ghost story. And GHOST reads exactly like a cross between TOPPER RETURNS and A GUY NAMED JOE: Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is murdered--but his spirit remains earthbound, seeking to uncover his own killer and re-establish contact with his beloved and grieving Molly (Demi Moore.) Eventually Sam manages to establish contact with a fraudulent medium named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg)--and in exchange for helping her out in the spiritualist business he convinces her to act as his agent on the earthly plane.All of this sounds fine in theory, but GHOST plays like something created by corporate marketing men, and instead of a fantasy confection the film serves up something more akin to a three month old poundcake awash in slobbering sentimentality. The cast makes absolutely no attempt to create characters--but given the zero-quality script level you can hardly blame them; the story itself is extremely predictable, and if you don't know who killed Sam halfway through the film you need to run out for quick brain-scan; and everything from cinematography to editing to design is just as ho-hum as it can be.The only reason to watch this film is for Whoopi Goldberg, who is absolutely hilarious as Oda Mae Brown--but frankly even Goldberg's comic turn can't make this turkey fly, and if you want to see her at her comic best I'd recommend you catch some of her stand-up work. My recommendation? Hunt down a copy of TOPPER RETURNS and A GUY NAMED JOE and watch the originals instead.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,6,16,16 May 2005
Citizen Kane," Fascinating--But Increasingly Problematic With The Passage of Time
","In order to survive the passing years, a film must be able to transcend the limitations of the era in which it was made. This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem. A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage. Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal. And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore. They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates. As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longer offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels. Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,12,18,29 July 2005
Monster," Extremely Well Done But Extremely Unsavory
","In 1992 Aileen Wuornos (1956-2002) stood trial for the murder of Richard Mallory in Florida. Clearly dangerous and disturbed, Wuornos was an extremely belligerent, aggressive personality, and her frequent outbursts and several bizarre circumstances turned the trial into a media circus. Convicted of Mallory's death, Wuornos also confessed to the murders of six others and remains a suspect in at least two unsolved homicides. She was executed in 2002.But for all the drama of the 1992 trial, MONSTER sidesteps this aspect of the Wuornos story. It instead focuses on Wuornos herself and her relationship with lover Selby (in real life Tyria J. Moore, the name change likely due to legal issues.) And while it plays fast and loose with the facts--particularly re the Selby character--it offers a relentlessly fearsome portrait of an incredibly damaged woman whose rage twists into a vicious killing spree.Charlize Theron, previously better known for good looks than acting skill, gives an inspired performance as Wuornos, seeming to inhabit the character; it is truly frightening to watch her. Although the script's Selby is hardly in the same league with real-life Tyria J. Moore, Ricci too is quite fine--a mixture of innocence and soullessness that is often quite as disturbing as Theron's more flamboyant performance. The supporting cast is also very good, with Bruce Dern notable as a biker friend and Scott Wilson particularly memorable as Wuornos' final victim.When I saw the film in theatrical release I found quite a few audience members walked out on the film in disgust. And for all the power of the performances and the great artistry of the film, this is likely to be a real issue for any one who sees MONSTER. The film does an extraordinary job of making us see Wuornos and Selby as human beings--and as pitiful human beings whose lives were largely warped and twisted by circumstance rather than personal choice. Even so, both characters are dangerous, mean, manipulative, and vicious in different ways, and our pity for them will not stretch far enough to cover that.In the final analysis, I do recommend the film. But before you rush to see it simply because it picked up a well-deserved Academy Award for Theron, you might do well to ask yourself: do I really want to know these people? And if you are unsure, you'd probably do better to give it a miss--for you might well be one of the people walking out midway through.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,1,2,1 April 2005
Alexander," An Epic Hubris
","Viewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's Alexander, which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time. The film is not about conquest; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most self-contradictory and enigmatic figures.The emphasis, however, should be on the word 'attempt.' Alexander fails in three basic ways: in its cast, in its refusal to meet certain character issues head-on, and in a directorial decision that easily ranks among the most serious misfires in recent memory.Alexander the Great was a charismatic, self-contradictory, and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the largest army the world had seen up to that point. He was a battle-tested killing machine by age sixteen, King of Macedonia by twenty, conqueror of the known world by thirtyÂ—and above all one of the great military geniuses of his or any other age. Colin Farrell plays the character as a weak-minded, emotionally distraught entity, going through the entire film with a series of facial expressions that would lead to believe he is desperate need of a dose of salts. It is completely impossible to accept him in the role.Although Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performances as King Philip and Queen Olympias, the remaining performances are equally impossible. Jared Leto's Hephaistion looks for all the world like a Malibu hooker afflicted by an eyeliner addiction; it is impossible to perceive him as Alexander's military whip. Franciso Bosch's Bagoas could be an ancient-world version of Cher after a particularly thick night, albeit with better cleavage. As for Queen Roxane, history notes that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that Alexander found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father. The role, however, is considerably revised, and while Rosario Dawson gives it all she has the part plays like something out of bondage skin flick.During the film's theatrical release some audiences complained that Alexander was portrayed as a homosexual. Unfortunately, you cannot offer a psychological portrait of Alexander without indicating his general indifference to women and putting him in bed with at least two men: the general Hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave Bagoas. That is who Alexander was; that was what the ancient world was like. But instead of meeting this issue head-on, the film attempts to 'indicate' the relationships through a series of longing gazes, the occasional caress, and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen. The resulting relationships read like something off a television soap opera that has been canceled halfway into the first season.For the sexually insecure, there is a DVD issue that deletes some eight minutes of this footage; although I went with the unedited version, and although the scenes in question are very badly done, I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringe-inducing scenes improves the film to any significant degreeÂ—largely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward.The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that Anthony Hopkins is required to provide constant narrationÂ—something that has the effect of telling us what happened rather than allowing us to see it happen. But by far the greatest failing of the script and story line is Oliver Stone's decision to present a chunk of the story, such as it is, out of sequence.In essence, the first half hour of the film establishes the tri-fold conflict between King Philip, Queen Olympias, and the young Alexander and runs up to a major confrontation. At this point the film suddenly jumps eight years ahead to the invasion of Persia, and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous, unexpected, and disastrous flaw in the film. Approximately two hours later the film presents this 'lost time' in the form of a flashbackÂ—but by this point of the scenes have been lost and we've all figured out the details anyway. Oliver Stone is a master of creating parallel story lines and time lines. One need look no further than JFK to see his skill. It is astonishing, utterly astonishing, that he could do no better than this and, not being able to do better, did not find a better way entirely.When all is said and done, Alexander is presented as an out-of-control weakling, his psychological motivations are hilariously pat at best, and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force, much less lead it to a single victory, much less conquer the known world. Clearly Stone was attempting to reach a new height in epic cinema, but the Greeks had a word for ill-advised ambition founded on a god-like arrogance: hubris. It was a sin they believed was never left unpunished, and in this instance the punishment is a career-crippling, if not entirely career-killing, film.As noted, there are several DVD versions, including a director's cut that removes approximately fifteen minutes, eight of them dealing with Alexander's sexuality. Bonuses include documentaries on the making of the film and on composer Vangelis, who scored it, as well as an amazingly beside-the-point commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox.Gary F.

The Others," We Will Never Leave This House
","To a certain extent, one's enjoyment of THE OTHERS will depend on how quickly you recognize the major plot device on which the entire film turns. Once recognition sets in, how much you are able to further enjoy the film will then depend on how much you have become engaged by the characters--and it is here, really, that the film stumbles a bit, not so much through the way it is done but rather through the way the characters must be played in order for their behavior to make sense at the film's conclusion.The premise, which seems deeply influenced by both Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW and the 1960s film version known as THE INNOCENTS, concerns a woman who resides with her two children in an isolated mansion following World War II. Her situation is dire: her husband is missing in action and presumed dead; her children suffer from a rare genetic disease that makes sunlight dangerous to them; her servants have departed in the night without a word of warning. The latter problem seems remedied by the arrival of new servants--but no sooner are they installed than odd happenings begin to occur. Is the woman going mad? Are the servants involved? Have intruders secretly entered the house? Or could it be--something unearthly? The cast is exceptionally good here, with Fionnula Flanagan as the newly arrived servant Mrs. Mills and children Alakina Mann and James Bentley giving remarkable performances. But the focus is on Nicole Kiddman as Grace, a role that Kiddman plays with a white-knuckled grip and considerable ferocity--so much so that it becomes extremely difficult to like, much less sympathize, with the character. In some respects, however, this is ultimately necessary for this extremely plot-driven film to have any significant impact, and in hindsight it is hard to imagine that the role could be played in any other way; still, hindsight does not allow you to engage fully with the character when you are in the midst of the film. It is a flaw, but it is an unavoidable one--and the film is so remarkably stylish that it largely overcomes both the anticipated plot-twist and Kiddman's necessarily ferocious performance.The production values are first rate all the way down the line. Everything looks right, sounds right, feels right. But two items deserve special mention: the exceptional soundtrack, which was composed by director Alejandro Amenabar himself, and the stunning cinematography, which has tremendous visual texture and which neatly blends a fluidity of movement with a remarkably claustrophobic feel. If your tastes run to special effects and blood-spatter horror films, you are likely to disappointed, for there are none in THE OTHERS; Amenabar craftily creates tension more via what is suggested rather than shown, and doors left ajar and half-heard sounds are his devices of choice; it is all very subtle and yet remarkably chilling.The DVD package is a double-disk set, with the film on one disk and bonuses on the other. Although the bonuses are often quite interesting--particularly a documentary on individuals who actually suffer from hyper-sensitively to sunlight--they actually contribute little to the film itself, and it is a bit surprising that such a small bonus package would require a second disk. The sound for the feature is also problematic re home viewing, and I recommend that viewers play it at top volume, for there is no middle ground--everything is very quiet or very loud, and the contrast adds tremendously to the film's effect.It is extremely difficult to know how to rate this film, for as I've noted the very nature of the story has two embedded flaws: the almost inevitable recognition of the major plot device and the necessity of Kiddman's over-the-top performance. But even though I recognized the nature of the plot device very early in the film, and even though I found 'Grace' an unlikeable woman, this did not actually prevent me from feeling the icy breath with which director Amenabar endows THE OTHERS. Eight stars out of Ten.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,0,2,18 April 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Quietly Devastating
","BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has been described as 'a gay love story.' It is true that the story concerns an on-going relationship between two men, but this is merely the pebble director Ang Lee throws into the pond; the film itself is about the ripples the stone makes, and by examining them in meticulous fashion BROKEBACK creates a portrait of the way human beings are distorted by both external and self-imposed repression. It is a powerful film, an artful film. It is also one of the most painful films I have seen, the sort of film from which you emerge with a stunned sensation, and a film that lingers in your mind for a very long time afterward.In terms of plot the movie begins simply enough. Two ranch hands, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), are hired to tend sheep on Brokeback Mountain in the summer of 1963. Ennis is a very self-contained man. Jack is more outgoing and is presented, in a relatively subtle way, as a man who is open to sexual possibilities. As the summer progresses they become friends, and as Ennis opens up emotionally the two suddenly begin a sexual relationship. Although they are careful to tell each other that they are not gay, and although the words 'I love you' never cross their lips, the relationship develops into a romantic one. But all summers must end. The two men, struggling with emotions they are 'not supposed to have' for each other, leave the mountain and each other. Both men marry; both have children; both go on with their lives.But the stone makes ripples in the pond. Ennis, more so than Jack, is utterly unable to accept the idea that he is homosexual--and yet when Jack seeks him out several years later it is Ennis who leaps at Jack both sexually and emotionally, and what began as a seemingly transient affair rapidly develops into an overpowering relationship that they must conceal from wives, children, and society--and the consequences of concealment are devastating for all concerned. This is particularly true of Ennis, who has few internal resources, who is more afraid of social retribution, and who can neither let go of Jack nor bring himself to agree that they can live discreetly together. The result is a series of internal tragedies, failures, losses, and frustrations, all of which create a deep and abiding pain from which there is no escape.In terms of art, the film is beautifully crafted. Director Ang Lee approaches his material with a sparse grace and an eye for the telling detail, presenting the characters in such a manner as to allow you see them in the fullest possible way. He is greatly assisted in this by the remarkably powerful script by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, which translates Annie Proulx's memorable short story to the screen in both brilliant recreation and illumination, and by Rodrigo Prieto's simple yet compelling cinematography. The cast is fine beyond all possible expectation, never sounding a false note, and we believe them from start to finish. Nothing is either overplayed or underplayed; there is no artificially heightened drama; no manufactured element any kind. Indeed, with the single exception of an occasional make-up effect, it is virtually impossible to fault the film on any level. Is it a great masterpiece? I think it may well be. Time will tell.The film has been controversial on several fronts, but most particularly for the homosexual relationship that forms the spine of the plot. Some critics have seen this as evidence of 'Hollywood's leftist agenda;' others have stated that the film is the best possible argument for same sex marriage. To adopt these attitudes, however, is to impose ideas on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN that do not actually exist in the film. It is a rare example of a film that does not tell you what to think; it simply presents a story of what things were like, and in some respects are still like, for gay men and their families in America. It leaves you to make your own judgment about right, wrong, and where sympathy should reside.In closing, I will make an cautionary observation: while I strongly recommend the film, I must note that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN will likely take a toll on many gay viewers akin to the toll taken by PLATOON on Vietnam vets. I think this will be particularly true of gay men from largely rural and small town backgrounds and who are presently in their forties or older. It is profoundly painful to see elements of your life undergo this sort of extremely public autopsy, and had I realized the accuracy of the film I might well have elected to wait for a release to the home market. Having said this, I also note that in a visual sense BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN really requires the breadth of a movie screen, and I do recommend that it be seen in that format if at all possible.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,22,26,4 February 2006
Ed Wood," The Best Movie You've Never Seen
","Ed Wood (1924-1978) is generally regarded as the single worst film maker to emerge from Hollywood. This is not really true, for there were and are aplenty worse. But one thing has always set Wood above the pack, and that was his own unshakable faith in his talent. Unfortunately, the faith was misplaced and the talent was nonexistent--and although this Tim Burton film takes a slew of liberties with the facts of Wood's life and career, it does a remarkable job of capturing them as Wood likely saw them through the filter of his own outrageous ego. The film has two tremendous assets: the performers and its visual style. Johnny Depp leads the cast in the title role, and it is a virtuoso performance, for he entices us to like a man whose self-blindness would normally lead an audience to reject him out of hand; the performance is incredibly witty, wildly over the top, and yet it contains just enough pathos to allow us to relate to Wood on a human level. But the real stunner in the cast is Martin Landau, who picked up a Best Supporting Academy Award for his performance as Bela Lugosi, a legendary actor who was very much a forgotten star (not to mention morphine addict) by the time Wood befriended him in the early 1950s.As with Wood himself, the film plays fast and loose with the facts of Lugosi's life, but it nonetheless captures something very essential about both Lugosi and the Hollywood that destroyed him, something very elemental that transcends the weird comedy of the piece. And Landau gives the performance of his career; you truly believe that this is Lugosi before you, a strange but appealing mixture of faltering humanity and arrogance desperate for an audience now lost to him. Other memorable performances include Bill Murray as the inept and very la-dee-dah actor Bunny Breckinridge; Jeffrey Jones as The Amazing Criswell, popular 'psychic' and occasional Wood actor; Lisa Marie as television's 'Vampira;' and Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's fast wife and occasional actress Dolores Fuller. Indeed, there isn't a false note in the entire cast right down to the bit players and extras.In terms of visual style, Tim Burton nails the very look of an Ed Wood film in glittering black and white--but working with a budget that Wood never dreamed of he merges it with a series of classic Hollywood idioms that lift the style out of Wood's unfortunately flat style and into the realm of high art. In both look and direction, I strongly feel that this is Burton's single finest film to date.If the film has a flaw, it is that at times it recreates the flatness of an Ed Wood film a bit too precisely over too long a period--and the result can feel slightly dragged. And it is also a film that will register most clearly with those who have actually seen the films on which the movie focuses, so it may not appeal to the uninitiated. But for those who have the right eye, it is a remarkable film. Wickedly funny, unexpectedly touching, extremely memorable... and strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",9,1,1,31 March 2005
Catch-22," Misses The Point
","Based on the incredibly popular novel by Joseph Heller, sporting Mike Nichols as director, and featuring a first rate cast that included a host of brilliant actors, CATCH-22 was one of the most highly anticipated films of its year. And it proved one of the most critically-despised box office disasters of the early 1970s. Almost every one loathed everything about it.The story concerns a group of WWII bomber crews and support staff stationed on an island off the coast of Italy, on which they make bomb runs--but this is merely the peg on which Heller hung his savage satire on American bureaucracy. The film version, sadly, keeps the peg but manages to miss the rest.Part of the problem here is that the humor of the novel is deeply tied into the way in which Heller tells his story--and it simply doesn't translate well into film. That aside, Buck Henry's adaptation is an absolute disaster: instead of rapid-fire, it is slow-crawl, and instead of sharp-fanged it is gap-toothed. Mike Nichol's direction is an equal miscalculation, for he approaches the material with an odd sense of detachment that effectively kills even the little bit that Henry's script had going for it to begin with.Given all of this, the surprising thing about the movie is how well-cast it is and how good some of the performances are. You simply couldn't ask for a better Yossarian than Alan Arkin and the novel's Doc Daneeka might have been written with Jack Gilford in mind; Richard Benjamin, Art Garfunkle, Paula Prentiss, Bob Newhart, and even Orson Wells are among the many who give the film what little force it has. But ultimately, even the best performances in the film can't get the show off the ground. It is dead on arrival.The film is presently available on DVD, but the DVD package isn't anything to write home about; the film is well presented, but the commentary track is merely so-so and the rest of the bonuses are ho-hum. Although not, mercifully, as ho-hum as the extremely misguided film itself.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,12,23,18 April 2005
We Were Soldiers," A Vietnam Veteran Contemplates WE WERE Soldiers
","I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal. Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it. I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films. He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it. And about one and all he says: 'It wasn't like that.'He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought. He said, 'They finally got it. That's what it was like. All the details are right. The actors were just like the men I knew. They looked like that and they talked like that. And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew.' The he was silent for a long time. At last he said, 'You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off? Something like that happened to me once. It was at a helicopter crash. I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off. It looked just like that, too. I've never told any one about it.' In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground. And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful. Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film. It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds. Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield. The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue. The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a 'you are there' quality that is very powerful.I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place. And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd. But these are nit-picky quibbles. WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie. I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: 'It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie. I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie. But they pretty much get everything right. That's how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen.' Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,505,594,17 May 2005
MASH," Vulgar, Blasphemous, Mean Spirited--And Brilliant
","Although M*A*S*H is probably his most audience-friendly film, Robert Altman's style of over-lapping dialogue and multiple themes provokes a divided reaction even in this early work: you either like it or you don't. Perhaps more significant, however, are expectations raised by the popular and long-running television series the film inspired: the series concerned likable characters playing situation comedy with a dramatic spin. Viewers who expect to see this repeated in the film will be disappointed--and very probably outraged as well.Like most Altman films, M*A*S*H is character-driven, and there is no plot in any traditional sense. In general, the film concerns three surgeons (Hawkeye, Trapper, and Duke, here played by Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, and Tom Skerritt) who are drafted to serve in Korea. Sharing a mutual fondness for martinis and a complete disrespect for all things military, they run riot through the M*A*S*H 4077, mocking the efforts of by-the-book military officers to make them toe the line and using the army's need of their skills to prevent higher authority from penalizing them for their antics. Most of the characters (including the three leads) are somewhat unsympathetic, and the film's comic elements are deliberately grotesque, mean-spirited, blasphemous, sexist, and vulgar.Altman clearly intends us to read the Korean setting as a metaphor for Vietnam and the disrespect for an inept military authority as a metaphor for America's increasing disenchantment with military intervention in Vietnam. At the same time, the film's graphic surgery scenes provide us with a clear vision of the human toll war requires. Because the film mixes these points of view with comic elements, it is frequently described as an anti-war black comedy--but the film is so profoundly bitter that the word comedy, even when codified as 'black,' is rather misleading. There are certainly comic elements and even a few laugh-out-loud moments (most centering upon Margaret 'Hotlips' O'Houlihan, brilliantly played by Sally Kellerman), but the tone of the film is so bitter that the laughter induced is very rueful indeed.Seen today, M*A*S*H feels slightly uneven in execution and very much of its place and time--but even so the cast performs with an extremely compelling immediacy and Altman's dark and multi-layered vision makes a powerful statement. The DVD release features a superb restoration of the film, a rather dismissible director's commentary track, and four short documentaries re the film which are extremely interesting but often redundant. While I do recommend the film to newcomers, I offer the warning that response to the film varies considerably from individual to individual.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",9,2,4,16 May 2005
Alien," Iconographic Horror
","ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one. Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android 'revival' are fairly notorious). There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.BUT. The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money. Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups. With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars. A word of warning, however: you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one. And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself! Recommended.Gary F.

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," How About A Shave?
","Although some have tried to argue that he was an actual person, it seems likely that the story of a throat-cutting barber Sweeney Todd arose first as an urban myth that was developed into an 1846 story titled THE STRING OF PEARLS by writer Thomas Prest. A year later the story was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET.In the 1970s composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim adapted a version of the story to the musical stage. SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept every award available, box office fell short of expectation and the show ended with a run of 557 performances. Fortunately for us all, however, it has endured--first on the stage, then in concert, and now appearing as a film by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.The story, of course, is famous. Barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London after having been falsely imprisoned many years ago. When he seeks his family he is told his wife is dead, his daughter Joanna (Jayne Wisener) a prisoner of the lecherous judge (Alan Rickman) who sentenced him. Mad for revenge and criminally twisted, Barker takes the name Sweeney Todd and is soon slitting throats right and left--first by necessity but ultimately for the pleasure of it. He soon associates with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who finds a handy way of disposing of the bodies: she bakes them into meat pies and soon has a thriving business.Given his penchant for the Gothic, Burton would seem the perfect choice to helm a film version--and does so beautifully, especially in terms of design. This is the underbelly of Victorian, fog-shrouded London, rendered in dark tones with the occasional splash of red blood. The art design is nothing short of brilliant; the cinematography is all that you could wish. At the same time, however, there is something very slightly amiss: although it has its own fascination, the film simply isn't as funny as it should be. It is hard to say precisely why this is so, but it seems to me that the cause is two-fold: it lacks the satirical edge of the original and it has a slightly obvious quality. Instead of being innovative, SWEENEY TODD is simply Tim Burton as we already know him, and none of it comes as a surprise.The DVD release is quite handsome, with a huge number of extras and bonuses that are sure to please. Recommended, and sure to find status as a cult classic.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,1,3,19 April 2008
Battleship Potemkin," Brilliant; Seldom Equaled
","Based on actual events of 1905, silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city Odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of Imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. Amazingly, each of these sequences manage to top the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. Filming largely where the real events actually occurred, director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.To describe POTEMKIN as a great film is something of an understatement. It is an absolute essential, an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, seldom equaled, never bested.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,2,4,26 April 2005
American Beauty," The Image of Success
","The Burnhams are a typical, upwardly mobile family: a father with a well-paid job in advertising, a mother who is a driven real estate sales agent, an angst-ridden teen age daughter who is at an age to despise her parents. They live in a lovely home with a white picket fence, lovely roses, and a red door. Everything about them projects an image of success. And yet-- Lester (Kevin Spacey) hates his advertising job, which makes him feel like a prostitute selling second rate wares to stupid johns. Caroline (Annette Benning) is frustrated at being second-best in the real estate business. Daughter Jane (Thorah Birch) finds both of her parents vapid and doubts her own validity as a person--particularly when compared with her beautiful, sexed-up best friend Angela (Mena Suvari.) Their lives, like the lives of so many others rushing 'to get ahead in the world,' have become less about actually living than about maintaining and improving upon the appearance of success so prized by society.What is most astonishing about the film is its complete believability. Speaking as one who has worked a great deal in advertising and sales, I was amazed with the accuracy with which Ball's powerful and darkly funny script captured the lives of those whose values rest exclusively upon external achievement--Lester's growing and barely concealed hatred for advertising and Caroline's constant use of self-help tapes and personal success mantras are truly commonplace in the business world.Now, if American BEAUTY were merely this and nothing more, it would still be an astonishing film. But it goes considerably further than that--for Lester, suddenly motived by a lust for his daughter's friend Angela, realizes how completely unenjoyable 'keeping up appearances' has become. And he explodes the status quo in such a way as to bring every one's petty materialism and mask-like personaes into a sharp, very funny, and pitch-black focus as the shallow and meaningless things they are. And in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever.The cast is astonishing throughout, with Kevin Spacey the ultimate 'I Can't Take It Any More' man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard-core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet, a woman determined to 'project an image of success at all times' even if it kills her. Thora Birch is a remarkable young performer, as is her boyfriend Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari is perfectly cast as the youthful beauty for whom Spacey develops an unexpected passion. Mendes' direction is flawless here, and he navigates the both the complicated appearances of success and the personal shallowness it conceals with tremendous clarity, never overplaying his hand in either direction.Perhaps the most telling bits of the film are among the most subtle, as when the film posits the tiresomely yuppie but nonetheless considerably more honest gay couple next door as more genuine than the Burhams, Caroline's eternal efforts at ego building through motivational tapes, and the way in which Angela (in time honored teenage fashion) naively attempts to use sex as a weapon to conceal her own insecurities.The film is extremely funny, but it is also ultimately devastating. A great many people--particularly those who equate 'an image of success' with successful lives, will despise the film. But like it or not, American BEAUTY's take on the failure on the failure of the American dream is easily the most successful and deadly accurate satire on life in these United States since the equally wicked NETWORK. This is the real thing, people--and it may be too close to home for many. Watch it at your own risk. Strongly, strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,3,5,23 April 2005
Judgment at Nuremberg," A Rare Film of Considerable Power
","One rarely finds a movie that works on as many levels as Kramer's famous JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG. The film concerns an American judge (Spenser Tracy) sent to Germany to preside over a war-crimes trial at a point when American politicians are less concerned about justice than about securing German support re the Cold War. As such, the film concerns not only the Nazi atrocities on trial, but the American government's willingness to become accomplices after the fact if such will buttress America's own military interests. The film repeatedly raises questions concerning the price of such deliberate, feigned public ignorance--both as it was manifest in Nazi Germany before and during the war and as it is now becoming manifest in America and its allies after the war.The action of the film divides between the courtroom and the judge's personal experiences in Nuremberg. The courtroom scenes are quite powerful, with Maximillian Schell as the attorney for the defense who argues that his clients knew nothing of the holocaust and Richard Widmark who argues that one could not live in Nazi Germany without being aware of the holocaust. At the same time the judge finds the same battle in his social life when he meets Marlene Dietrich, widow of a Nazi officer, who insists that the German people (herself among them) were completely ignorant of Nazi atrocities and who clearly feels judgment of the German people should be quietly set aside now that the war is over. Ultimately, of course, Tracy must pass judgment both in the court and in his personal relationships on the degree to which claims of ignorance can be accepted as truth--and must accept responsibility for the result.Tracy and Dietrich's remarkable performances are equaled by Widmark and Schell. Indeed, the entire cast--which includes Burt Lancaster, Judy Garland, and Montgomery Cliff--is particularly fine. The script is remarkable for its directness, the cinematography is quite basic, and the score is both discreet and atmospheric. The film's conclusion, which includes a confrontation between judge Tracy and accused Lancaster, is extremely memorable. Although some may find the film a bit long or a bit too intellectual, most will be impressed with virtually every aspect of JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG--and most particularly with the casual restraint with which it tells it story and makes it powerful point. Required viewing. Highly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",9,2,3,20 August 2005
Van Helsing," I Used The Fast Forward on My Remote A Lot
","In the 1940s Universal Studios attempted to re-energize horror films at the box office by churning out movies that crammed as many famous monsters into the plot line as possible. The result was usually more notable for being silly than effective, and in spite of its highly touted CGI effects VAN HELSING is sillier still.Suggested by the vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, the film presents a young and sexy Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is in the employ of a secret sect of the Roman Catholic Church run along James Bond lines. After a little run in with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvannia along with a trusty Friar as sidekick. There they promptly meet a sexy vampire hunting gypsy princess, and the three promptly encounter the Wolf Man, the Frankestein Monster, Dracula, Dracula's Brides, and even Dracula's Babies. Who would have thunk it? The CGI effects are impressive and the occasional homages to the original Universal Studio horror films of the 1930s and 1940s are occasionally amusing--but the whole thing very quickly collapses into a lot of visual and audio noise, and there isn't much to hold it together. After about half an hour I began to use the fast forward button on my remote a lot. It's a case of the director, actors, and special effects people having more fun than the audience.The film is presently available to the homemarket on DVD. The transfer is quite good, although to my eye CGI effects do not work as well on the home screen as they do on the big screen. There are also a handful of bonuses, none of which are greatly interesting or particularly well done. Final take: this a movie that seems to be made by and for a bunch of hyperactive fourteen year old boys without a whole lot of imagination.Gary F.

Dreamgirls," Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy Steal The Show
","DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 and was in the running for a film version long, long before it closed in 1985. Very loosely based on the lives and career of The Supremes, it told the story of a black girl group whose cross-over from 'race records' to the pop charts fuel the success of an increasingly cut-throat recording mogul--and find the price of fame and fortune in the recording industry too high for their liking. While it borrows a great deal from numerous music personalities and stories of the 1960s and 1970s, DREAMGIRLS is essentially a riff on the career of The Supremes and the group's relationship with Motown founder Berry Gordy.The Supremes were originally created by Florence Ballard, a powerhouse vocalist who worked with Diana Ross and Mary Wilson as back up singers. Berry sought a group that could cross over into the pop charts and reformulated the line-up, moving the prettier Diana Ross to lead--and ultimately dismissing Ballard from the group entirely, replacing her with Cindy Birdsong. After the music industry turned its back on Ballard, she declined in alcoholism and poverty and died at age 32. She is widely regarded as one of the great tragic figures on the long list of American rock and roll casualties.When DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 critics praised its powerhouse performances and its dazzling staging--but were somewhat less favorable toward its script and score, noting that the characters were one-note and with one or two exceptions that the score was neither memorable nor able to capture the sharply crafted pop hooks of the Motown style it tried to mimic. Even so, the play ran five years, and over the years numerous studios, producers, directors, and stars have took a crack at bringing it to the screen--something that didn't happen until 2006. And once more critics praised its powerhouse performances and dazzling staging--and were considerably less enthusiastic about its script and score.The great flaw in DREAMGIRLS is that, while it centers on the story of Florence Ballard, neither the stage nor screen version actually has the nerve to play it out: it, the rivalry between Ballard and Ross, and the brutalities of the music business are actually somewhat underplayed in an effort to place every character in a softer light. As for the music, the score does include the stunning 'I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,' but the original criticism stands: although pleasant enough, the songs are not particularly memorable and they do indeed lack the sharp, slick edges of the Motown sound that inspired them.Like many another period film, the look is not really accurate: instead of accurately depicting the 1960s and 1970s it is that era as seen through a modern filter, the 1960s and 1970s as we tend to recall them rather than as they actually were. Even so, there is plenty of visual splash; the costumes, the concert stagings, and the overall art design is quite fine, and you never actually question accuracy while it unfolds before. And then there are the performances.With the exception Jamie Foxx, who seems slightly miscast in the role of music manager and producer Curtis Taylor, DREAMGIRLS is filled with memorable performances. Although she does not imitate Diana Ross per se, Beyonce Knowles captures Ross' look and sense of style remarkably well; Danny Glover offers a memorable turn as agent Marty Madison; and overall the supporting cast is quite fine. But the big noises her are Eddie Murphy as James Early, a role based on several singers of the era but most particularly on James Brown, and Jennifer Hudson as Effy White, the role based on Florence Ballard.Murphy's film career has been very up and down over the years, ranging from the popular 48 HOURS to the disastrous HARLEM NIGHTS, and he is at present best known for such mild comedies as DR. DOOLITTLE and NORBIT. He typically plays himself--but DREAMGIRLS puts him on the acting map in a serious way. Not only does he does he offer an extraordinary bit of work as the flamboyant but self-destructive R&B singer, he tears strips off his musical numbers. Prior to her appearance in DREAMGIRLS, Jennifer Hudson was best know as an also-ran on television's American Idol, which entirely failed to anticipate the depths of her vocal talents and acting skill. DREAMGIRLS, however, exploited what television missed--and while it is technically a supporting role, Hudson's Effie White is the glue that holds the whole thing together. It is easily the most remarkable screen debut since Barbra Striesand's 1968 FUNNY GIRL.DREAMGIRLS is not a 'perfect' film, much less a 'great' musical. As previously noted, the script is a bit weak and the music slightly below expectations, and when all is said and done it's a bit too glossy for its own good. But it is easy on the eyes, the cast is solid, and you'll never be less than amazed by Murphy and Hudson. The one-disk DVD offers extended scenes but little else; if you are a hardcore fan you'll no doubt want to go with the double disk special edition.

Pearl Harbor," High Gloss Hollywood Eye Candy For The Brain Dead
","At one point during the attack at Pearl Harbor, a character says, 'I think World War II just started!'--ignoring the fact that no one used the term at the time. This is rather typical of the movie as a whole: obviously improbable, often flatly impossible, and flogging every clichÃ© to the nth degree.Although it markets itself as a highly authentic depiction of the events leading up to and the attack on Pearl, PEARL HARBOR is essentially a three hour long and extremely improbable soaper about a love triangle between two friends and a navy nurse. This plot line, which occupies the first third of the film, asks us to believe the proverbial six impossible things before breakfast and predictably reaches a peak just in time for the Japanese attack. The second third of the film shows the attack itself.Although the attack at Peal Harbor is an exciting bit of film-making, it is really here that the film falls completely apart, asking us to believe that the two male leads not only manage to get their planes off the ground, perform all sorts of acrobatics, blow Japanese Zeros all over the sky, and then land safely to return to the woman they love. As if this is not absurd enough, the film then goes on to send both men off on the Doolittle Raid on Japan itself.By this point the men have been childhood friends, gone to flight school together, become pilots together, been through Pearl, and are now crash landing in China--and I began to wonder why they were bothering with the nurse; given that their primary interests seemed to be in each other they might as well have dropped their drawers and gotten in bed with each other too. Indeed, such a turn of events would have at least added a touch of curiosity value to this otherwise dreary bit of high-gloss cinematic nonsense.The DVD contains a History Channel documentary re Pearl Harbor that is very good, a 'Making Of' documentary that is disgracefully and distastefully self-congratulatory, and a number of other extras, some of which you will need a computer to access. The picture quality and sound are excellent throughout. Sadly, the movie itself is not.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",1,6,12,30 July 2005
Gone with the Wind," Potent Mythology
","In the years since it debuted, GONE WITH THE WIND has taken a beating from film critics and historians alike. The characters are often described as cardboard-ish; portions of the film are described as excessively melodramatic; some of the special effects (most notably the film's occasional use of rear-view projections) have dated. There is some truth to all of these comments, but by far the most serious accusation hurled at the film is that it is racist.One's perception of the film as racist rather depends on whether you look at the film within the context of its era or from a purely modern standpoint. At the time, GONE WITH THE WIND was a major advance in the portrayal of blacks on screen, for the two major black characters--Mammy and Prissy--are a far cry from the obnoxious 'Stepin Fetchit' stereotypes so common in the 1930s. In later years, both Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen would be derided for their participation in the film and accused of perpetuating stereotypes, but in fact their performances were anything but stereotypical at the time--indeed, their very power led Hollywood into a repetition of similar characters, and it was that repetition that later caused the originals to read as clichÃ©d.The real problem with GONE WITH THE WIND is that it, like the novel on which it is based, buys into the myth of great plantations, lovely Southern belles, gallant gentlemen, and a paternalistic form of slavery. These concepts have some basis in fact, but the vast majority of southern whites did not own plantations, much less own slaves, and those who did rarely practiced 'paternalistic' slavery by any stretch of the imagination. But GONE WITH THE WIND is the myth, not the fact--and once we accept it as a highly romanticized vision of the South as it never really was, the film becomes incredibly entertaining and can still cast its spell upon the modern viewer.The most powerful thing about the film is that it moves. Over the course of its very long run, the episodic story of the beautiful and willful Scarlett O'Hara and her rapacious drive to insulate herself from the hardships of the war never significantly drags. And the cast, from the leads to the bit players, is superior.Margaret Michell might have created Rhett Butler with Clark Gable in mind; Vivien Leigh, a remarkable beauty and a very fine actress, was scarcely known outside England--but amazingly, when one considers the tremendous anticipation surrounding the casting of the role, she plays Scarlett with incredible success. Granted that the characters of Melanie and Ashley are rather unbelievable, but both Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard carry them off with conviction. And although they have already been mentioned, Hattie McDaniel's formidable Mammy and Butterfly McQueen's passive-aggressive and frequently hysterical Prissy are brilliant creations and more than worthy of a second mention.True, advances in cinema technique have made some of the special effects seem dated, but the production values and art design are brilliant from throughout, and the film offers a multitude of iconographic moments: Rhett standing at the bottom of the staircase at Twelve Oaks; Scarlett caught up in a the panic during the siege of Atlanta; the tattered flag waving above the fallen troops at the train yard; the kiss between Rhett and Scarlett after the fall of Atlanta--these, yes, and many, many more.GONE WITH THE WIND will no doubt become increasingly controversial as attitudes continue to change re race, slavery, and the Civil War--but in terms of pure cinema it is a remarkable achievement for all involved and it remains a landmark to this day. The DVD currently available offers a pristine picture and high quality sound, but I must note that the DVD has no great advantage over the current VHS release; a trailer aside, there are no bonus materials of any kind, and both are of equal quality. Strongly recommended, but with a warning: do not mistake it for fact. As I noted earlier, this is a South that never was, built on a form of slavery far removed from the slavery that actually existed. Enjoy it as a beautifully made and epic romance with a host of powerful performances--but not as history.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",9,0,1,19 April 2005
No Country for Old Men," Violence, Emptiness, and Flashes of Dark Humor
","The Cormac McCarthy novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is an ideal vehicle for the Coen brothers, who have used violence and emptiness laced with dark humor as an artistic aesthetic since the beginning of their careers--and although the setting and story are quite different it is very, very like FARGO in mood, style, and themes.The story concerns Texan Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad, takes the money, and runs. He is pursued by hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem); both are pursued by sheriff Tom Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones.) Curiously, the film never allows any of the three men to meet; it instead follows their various paths toward and away from each other, paths that cross, diverge, and at times seem quite random.Although the characters drive the story in the sense that they make the decisions they do because of who they are, the overall impression of the film is one of an initially calculated violence that becomes increasingly random as it progresses. There is no ultimate reason or deep meaning; just an open-ended emptiness of non-resolution and futility.The cast is quite good, with Brolin, Bardem, and Jones perfectly cast and extremely believable in their roles; Kelly MacDonald, who plays the role of Llewelyn's wife, is particularly fine. The production values are also memorable. But like most Coen films, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN seems to skate on the surface of its story rather than offer it to us in depth--the idea, one presumes, to allow us to impose our own ideas upon its very carefully crafted blankness. In this instance it works more often than not, but it is extremely noticeable when it doesn't, and the film often reads as self-consciously quirky as a result.The DVD contains three backstory documentaries including a 'making of' piece; in truth, however, all three are of a piece. Recommended, but not to all tastes.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,3,5,19 April 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Great Battle Sequences in Otherwise Tepid Movie
","For once the hype surrounding a Spielberg film proves accurate: the first half-hour of the film, which shows the WWII Allied invasion of Normandy, is every bit as powerful as you've heard, a knock-you-flat piece of film-making that surpasses every other cinematic image of war's hell. Unfortunately, D-Day as such has absolutely nothing to do with the story of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: once this brilliant sequence is over, we are left with a highly sentimental, tiresomely repetitive, and completely unoriginal film that drags on and on to an extremely obvious conclusion.The story concerns a young man (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in battle, leaving him as his parents' only surviving child. Top brass decide that Pvt. Ryan must be sent home--but they are not entirely sure where he is in war-torn Europe. Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) is accordingly snatched up from the D-Day battle and along with a handful of men is sent to find Ryan and bring him back in one piece--and at this point the film pretty much comes to a grinding halt.Hanks once again proves why he is among Hollywood's most bankable stars: like James Stewart, he has an everyman quality sure to appeal to most viewers--but although he remains as likable as ever, the script really doesn't give Hanks much to work with, and neither he nor his co-stars are greatly memorable. Indeed, once the opening battle sequence ends the film becomes so slow and so repetitive that you could easily nip outside, cut the lawn, and come back in to find you've not missed anything at all. Final word? The opening battle scene is worth the movie, but don't think you're missing anything if you can't stay awake for the end.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,3,8,17 May 2005
1941," Typical Spiellberg
","In the documentary that accompanies this director's cut version, now available on DVD, Spielberg makes the comment that he agreed to direct 1941 for the simple reason that he didn't have anything better to do at the time. It was an attitude that didn't bode well for the film, and the final result was one of the most horrific critical and box office disasters of the late 1970s: a film that opened with tremendous hype one night and all but vanished from theatre screens the next.I did not see the original release, which I understand was quite a bit different from this director's cut, so I can't say if I find the present version better or worse. But I can say it isn't as bad as you may have heard. (Indeed, in some respects it is better than most Spielberg films, for it generally lacks the ham-handed sentimentality so typical of his work.) All the same, I can also say that it isn't as good as some would have you believe. As slapstick comedies go, it is only incidentally funny.The premise is intriguing. In the wake of Pearl Harbor, Californians have fallen prey to the fear that they will be the next attacked--and that fear spawns an increasing paranoia. If the writers (and Spielberg himself, who apparently egged them on) had focused on this, 1941 might actually have been a truly memorable comedy... but instead the film rips and snorts in every direction imaginable in an effort to cram in everything from riffs on DR. STRANGELOVE to the Los Angeles 'Zoot Suit Riots' to expensive special effects pratfalls that are only mildly amusing at best.The plot inevitably splits into several different directions, and the result is rather like IT'S MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD meets ANIMAL HOUSE and the two do a belly flop into a bucket of Hollywood gloss--but without making much of splash. Many of the individual performers are quite good (Slim Pickens, Ned Beatty, and Treat Williams particularly so), and many of the situations have tremendous potential. But in the final analysis, 1941 is the sort of film that you don't bother to pause when you go to the bathroom.That said, the DVD package is quite nice: the film looks good, and I was particularly impressed with the sound. There isn't a director's commentary track, but there is a rather lengthy 'making of' documentary that includes extended interviews and home-movies taken of the set that provide behind-the-scenes glimpses of the cast, most particularly of the late great John Belushi. Fans of the Spielberg style will likely adore the whole thing, but for rest of us... this is a rental you won't mind returning the next day. Whether you finished watching it or not.Gary F.

Lawrence of Arabia," A Desert Myth: Perhaps the Finest Film 'Epic'
","To understand the Middle East as it presently exists, one must understand World War I and its consequences for those who live in the region. In making such a study, one inevitably and repeatedly encounters the name T.E. Lawrence, then and now one of the most controversial military figures of the 20th Century, a remarkably complex man who combined an unassuming manner with an astonishing flair for self-promotion.Lawrence authored an account of his Arabian adventures following the war. Titled THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM, it has the very unusual distinction of being extremely famous before it was widely available: originally printed in a limited edition of 120 copies, it was widely praised, but it was not given a further printing until after Lawrence's death--at which point both those who served with Lawrence and historians alike noted that the work was much less accurate, much less factual than its first readers supposed. Still, between the press coverage and the man's own gift for self-mythology, it was enough. T.E. Lawrence was enshrined in memory as Lawrence of Arabia, and in the late 1950s and early 1960s David Lean set out to make a film about him, using THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM as primary source.A great deal has been made of the film's factual inaccuracies; a great deal more has been made of the film's failure to explicitly portray Lawrence's covertly sadomasochistic personality and homo-erotic edge. But LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not a film of mere fact; we must turn to documentary for that. It is the myth, a vision of Lawrence as he himself wished to be seen, and the covert indications of his hidden nature adds greater depth to both his character and the film as a whole: as the story progresses we become acutely aware that there is much more that we do not know, a fact that lends a tremendous sense of mystery to the film. Factual, no; explicit, no. But in its entirety, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA achieves an artistic truth that transcends any mere notation of fact pure and simple.It is, in my opinion, the single finest film of epic scope to ever reach the screen. The episodic story, scripted by Robert Bolt (author of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS), casts a remarkably wide net, not only following Lawrence's adventures but placing them within a finely drawn context of diplomacy as well. The cast is superb. Led by Peter O'Toole in the title role, virtually every actor involved not only brings the various historical figures to vivid life, but transmutes them into archetypes as well. David Lean's direction is flawless, as is the astonishingly beautiful cinematography, artful yet unobtrusive editing, and truly memorable score.It is true that LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is best seen on the big screen, where its visual power may be seen a full power; even so, it fares remarkably well on the small screen, much more so than epics that rely on visual power to the exclusion of all else. There have been several releases to the home market, including a double cassette VHS and a two disk DVD with a host of extras; the single DVD release, a 'no frills' release without significant extras, also offers a near-pristine picture and excellent sound. If you are interested in purchasing the film, make certain that you are not buying a pan-and-scan version, for these very significantly undercut the beauty of the film.Alternatively languid and violent, beautiful and disquieting, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a remarkably fine film that deserves every praise heaped upon it since its 1962 release. I cannot recommend it too highly.Gary Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,5,10,29 March 2005
JFK," American Fact? Or American Fiction?
","In 1969, New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison brought noted New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw to trial for conspiracy to murder President John F. Kennedy. To date, this is the only trial of any individual in reference to the Kennedy assassination. This controversial 1991 film follows Garrison's investigation into the Kennedy assassination from the day of Kennedy's death to the conclusion of the trial--and it has prompted almost as much controversy as the assassination itself.How much of this film are we to take as fact and how much of it are we take as fiction? Critics have noted that as a historian, Stone is a great filmmaker, and with JFK Stone creates a vision so extreme that even some conspiracy theorists have denounced it as completely impossible. But that may actually be part of the film's point: that we live in a society that typically subverts the truth, a world in which facts are hard to come by and in which speculation runs wild.However you wish to take the film, there's no denying that it is exceptionally well done. Much of its power rests on visuals. JFK is presented on different film stocks with various grains and color qualities, and these scenes--some of them lasting only seconds--are combined like pieces of an jigsaw puzzle to create a slowly emerging picture of American politics at its worst. The script, largely based on Garrison's book ON THE TRAIL OF THE Assassins, works in much the same fashion, shifting rapidly from scene to scene and back and forth in time. In combination, cinematography and script have a cumulative power that is most impressive, and Williams' haunting score adds greatly to the effect.The ensemble cast is easily one of the best I've ever seen. Kevin Costner is not, perhaps, ideally cast as Jim Garrison--but he plays in an extremely low-key manner completely devoid of any 'star' trappings, and thus throws focus on the myriad of characters who swirl through the story. Gary Oldman is uncanny as Lee Harvey Oswald. His performance is such that you're often unsure if you watching Oldman or news footage of Oswald, and Brian Doyle-Murray achieves a similar effect with the smaller role of Jack Ruby.But perhaps the most memorable are the host of actors who appear in unlikely roles and who acquit themselves exceptionally well. Joe Pesci gives a typically aggressive performance in the strange role of a right-wing paramilitary homosexual, Kevin Bacon is completely unexpected and flawless as a hard-bitten gay prostitute, and Tommy Lee Jones is impressive as the influential Clay Shaw. Other memorable performers include Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Sally Kirkland, and Donald Sutherland--and in a wicked twist of irony Jim Garrison himself appears as Justice Earl Warren.The film is available on VHS and in several DVD packages, including a 'director's cut' special edition that includes a number of extras, including an often interesting director's commentary, an interview with famous conspiracy theorist Prouty, and a documentary on certain intriguing records recently declassified by Congress as a direct result of this film's impact.Historians and theorists will probably wrangle over the JFK assassination for decades, perhaps centuries to come. But whether you buy into Oliver Stone's scenario in whole, in part, or not at all, film is both extremely well-done and provocative to the max. If you want to stir conversation, this will do it.

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," 'We Cannot Defend Freedom Abroad By Deserting It At Home'
","During the early 1950s the United States of America valued conformity over honesty and integrity--a social lockstep driven by fears that the Soviet Union had infiltrated American government and society and sought to bring our society crashing into chaos. As the decade progressed, a number of politicians played upon those fears to their own greater glory, and few played harder than Senator Joseph McCarthy, who shocked the nation when he claimed to have factual evidence that numerous branches of the government were overrun by communists and communist sympathizers.Over the past decade or so a number of historians and critics, Anne Coulter among the latter, have attempted to rehabilitate Senator McCarthy's reputation by noting that there were indeed communist infiltrators at work in the United States government. This was doubtlessly true, but there are several problems with this pro-McCarthy argument. Chief among them is McCarthy himself. His accusations were not based on fact and were strewn with misinformation, and he showed a marked tendency to level them against two types of people: those who could not fight back and those who dared to criticize him. If McCarthy ever did manage to expose a communist it was by dumb luck only, and by 1954 even the members of his own party--including President Dwight Eisenhower--were openly disgusted by his behavior.GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is the story of how Edward R. Murrow, possibly the single most respected reporter of his era, exposed McCarthy for what he was via a meticulously prepared news program. In the wake of this broadcast an outraged public turned against McCarthy and thus gave the Senate the public support required to end his reign of terror. At the same time, it is also the story of television's role as entertainer ultimately undercut its role as news medium--and laid the destructive seeds of the 'news as entertainment' format that today typically overpowers serious journalism.It is in many respects a fascinating film, its script drawn from the actual words of the actual people involved in the Murrow telecast. It is memorably directed by George Clooney and remarkably performed by an ensemble cast that includes David Staitham, Robert Downey Jr., Frank Langella, and Clooney himself. The black and white art direction and cinematography is brilliant, truly capturing the look and feel of the era; the pace is rapid fire; and it offers a series of pointed warnings about political bankruptcy and public expectations of television that ring true in no uncertain terms.Unfortunately, it also manages to ever so slightly miss the mark. This is partly due to the film's divided intent: by refusing to focus specifically on either McCarthy or the issue of broadcast news it manages shortchange both. It also errs in its use of considerable archival footage, which leaves us to wonder if we might be better off watching a documentary on McCarthy and Murrow instead of GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK. But the ultimate problem with the film is that gives zero context. We are told nothing of the tenor of times, given no clear idea of what made McCarthy's claims seem initially viable, and indeed given no clear idea of what those claims actually were. We are simply given to understand that he is a danger to democracy and shown actual film footage of McCarthy to prove what we are assumed to already know.In the end, I have to say that it is always a good thing to be reminded of McCarthy. He stands as a warning to us against those who would play upon our fears for the sake of their own power. It is also always a good thing to be reminded that 'finest hour' events in television news tend to be few and far between largely because of the commercial, entertainment-oriented nature of the medium. But GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LOOK isn't entirely successful in making its points in either direction. The DVD includes a making-of documentary that is reasonably interesting and an audio commentary that is largely spurious. Recommended, but primarily for those who already have enough historical knowledge to fill in the gaps.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,1,2,3 February 2008
Mulholland Drive," In The Eye of the Beholder
","I came to MULHOLLAND DRIVE with extreme reluctance. Although I've seen most of Lynch's work, it has been more by accident than by design, and I had no expectation of great interest in the film. For Lynch is an extremely divisive director: you either like his work or you do not, and by and large I fall into the latter category. So I sympathize with those who loathe everything about the film--but at the same time I am surprised by how much I myself admired it.Opening with an attempted murder thwarted by an unexpected car-crash, the film presents us with a beautiful woman (Laura Harring) who stumbles into Los Angeles in shock and suffering from amnesia. Using the name 'Rita,' she crosses paths with pert and pretty Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), new to the city and in search of a film career. Betty quickly decides to shelter Rita, and the two women begin to search for Rita's true identity.A number of subplots, seemingly random incidents, and bizarre events complicate the basic premise; even so, I think most viewers will be able to buy into the film and find themselves extremely curious about the film's approaching conclusion. But therein lies the rub, for it is exactly at this point that the film suddenly deconstructs and forces you to completely reevaluate everything you've previously seen.A number of recent films, including the extremely popular SIXTH SENSE and THE OTHERS, have used a similar device, a sudden twist that spins your basic perception of the overall story. In both cases, however, these were logical extensions of the basic plot; the device in MULHOLLAND DRIVE, however, is not, and it does not so much spin perception as it completely overturns and then completely reinterprets the entire film up to that point. And there are only two possible reactions: jaw-dropping astonishment or a savage disgust with the whole thing.There have been endless interpretations and analyses of this film, and many people complain that they don't understand it. I may be running against the tide here, but I have to say that you shouldn't try to 'understand' MULHOLLAND DRIVE; instead, accept it as a journey into an extremely disturbed mind as it plays games with itself. For with this film, Lynch essentially takes us inside madness itself, an insanity that dreams Hollywood dreams grown into monsters of the subconscious.Yes, I do think there is much to admire here in spite of several very obvious flaws--not the least of which is a distinct difference in tone as the film shifts between portions originally planned for television and portions filmed when Lynch realized he could salvage the project as a feature film. But at the same time, admiring is not necessarily liking: MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a very dark place, and for myself one visit was enough.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",9,2,4,1 April 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Entertaining But Trivial
","Tarantino makes movies about other movies: his films lift everything from characters to plot devices to camera angles, glosses up the costumes and attitudes, laces them with adolescent humor, and then swirls all the bits and pieces together in a tub of blood. The results have been extremely inconsistent but never less than interesting in at least an academic, art house sort of way.KILL BILL, VOLUME 1 is essentially a teenage boy's blood and sex fantasy run amok. The story is so classically revenge it might have--and maybe was--inspired by Elizabethan drama. A woman who has been a member of an international squad of hired assassins becomes pregnant and decides to marry and retire; at her wedding reception, however, her handler and co-killers crash the event and kill every one. Well, almost every one: she survives. Four years later she awakens from a coma, is mightily ticked about the whole thing, and decides to kill everyone who was involved in the attack.As in PULP FICTION, Tarantino borrows a great deal from a host of film masters, perhaps most notably from Hitchcock, Kubric, Altman, Stone, and Lynch: narrative camera angles that rise to provide a bird's eye view of the actors as they move through the sets, disjointed time, overlapping plots, and a heavily stylized visual sense. He also borrows a great deal from 1960s and 1970s 'trash cinema,' most particularly Kung Fu foolishness and deliberately sparse spaghetti Westerns. In terms of story and overall execution, however, this is essentially the stuff of a pimple-ridden teenage boy's blood and sex fantasies: sexy women fighting, shooting, and slashing the hell out of each other.In this instance Tarantino gets away with it because he seldom gives you very much time to think about any of it--and on the rare occasions when he does, he goes out of his way to point out his various juxtapositions with a gleeful 'I Meant To Do That!' finger. And there is a lot about the film that is quite funny in the same pitch black, subversive way that PULP FICTION was funny. Two women square off in a snow-drenched Japanese garden to Spanish music and so on, the sort of small inter-cultural cinematic jibe that Tarantino does so well when he puts his mind to it. It's actually very entertaining.But there is a problem here, and it is the same problem that has plagued every one of Tarantino's films. Yes, the film is deliberately trendy in a truly relentless way and often very funny as a result; yes, the fight choreography is visually stunning; yes, the deliberate clash of music and visuals and cultures is often very witty. But in the end it is all a surface cleverness with nothing underneath, and the film is really Tarantino's ode to how hip and cool he wants us to think he is. We never see him on the screen, but we're constantly aware of him standing off to one side screaming 'LOOK AT ME!' You might describe the whole thing as an entertaining study in the director's overcompensation for not actually being the 'super-cool' guy of his own cinematic fantasies.Note to Mr. Tarantino: as a friend of mine is fond of saying, 'cool' can't be acquired, it simply is, and you either have it or you don't. I've never met you, but I'm pretty sure that you aren't a quarter as 'cool' as you tell people you are, and I'm also pretty certain that you know it yourself. Now, you actually seem to be a talented guy; why don't you stop this foolishness and actually do your own movie instead of tap-dancing through all the stuff, good and bad, you saw when you were fifteen? That said, I actually rather liked the film. (A lot of people won't. It is very bloody and the humor involved is dark.) It's worth a look, and if you don't expect anything except pure surface you may well enjoy it. But it's not something I'll watch again and I can't see myself going out of the way to see KILL BILL VOLUME 2.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,1,2,10 June 2007
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Sometimes Frustrating But Always Fascinating
","Meet Hans, an East Berlin teenager desperate to escape the communist block who undergoes a botched sex change operation in order to marry an American military man and flee to the free world. Now meet Hedwig, the rock-em-shock-em punk band leader into which Hans transforms himself when his American husband abandons him in the midwest. Embittered when the Berlin wall falls and furious when a later teenage-lover steals her music and becomes an arena-filling rock star, Hedwig now dogs the teenager's steps by staging a tour with her own band and following him from town to town.John Cameron Mitchell, who co-wrote and starred in the New York show and who appears in the film as both director and star, mutes the more savage tones of the stage original in favor of pathos and a broader sense of the character's humanity; consequently, the film isn't really as far-out or edgy as it might seem and it lacks the sharp bite you might expect. The film also seems a bit unfocused, a bit unstructured, and at times I felt a bit frustrated by what it leads you to expect but never actually delivers. Even so, Mitchell and company (especially Miriam Shor), give some extremely interesting and often drop-dead funny performances, and the music performed by the band as it tours is first rate throughout.Sadly, some viewers will reject the film without seeing it on the basis of subject matter alone--which would be a mistake. Often funny, often touching, and certainly thought-provoking, HEDWIG packs a solid punch by appealing to the untapped creativity in all of us and leads us to question our own internal sense of unity. The characters and ideas it presents linger in mind afterward, and while Hedwig and her angry inch aren't quite as knock-out as you could wish they're still fascinating.The DVD release contains lots of extras, most notably a documentary (almost as long as the movie itself) that describes the creation of both stage show and film. The footage of the New York show is particularly fascinating. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,1,2,28 July 2005
Singin' in the Rain," One of the Best
","SINGIN' IN THE RAIN's story is well known, and concerns 1920s silent romantic acting team Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen.) Trouble is that sound is coming in--and Lina's speaking voice could peel paint off the wall. The solution? Don's best friend (Donald O'Connor) and love interest (Debbie Reynolds) have the inspiration of revamping Lockwood and Lamont's debut sound film as a musical, with Reynolds dubbing Hagen's vocals. The resulting story is a high-energy, extremely witty, and truly sparkling film laced with period songs by Arthur Freed, a film that many regard as the single finest musical to emerge from Hollywood.In many respects SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a throwback to the early musicals of the era it satirizes, for many of its musical numbers ('Make 'em Laugh' is a notable example) have absolutely nothing to do with the story it tells--but unlike such early musicals the storyline is exceptionally strong, and since the film is about the creation of an early 'all talking, all dancing, all singing' movie in which such musical numbers were typical, they have here a certain validity that could not otherwise be achieved.The cast is absolutely flawless, and without exception Kelly, Reynolds, O'Connor, and Hagen (particularly memorable as the literally unspeakable silent star) give the finest performances of their respective careers. The musical numbers range from the vibrant and complex 'Good Morning' to the lyrical 'You Are My Lucky Star' to the brilliantly conceived and executed title song, each without exception the definition of perfection. The art designs are meticulous, beautiful, and recreate the late-silent and early-sound era of Hollywood with considerable wit and charm. As a whole, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN possesses an energy and vitality that simply makes you bounce in your seat from excitement.SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a musical that even people who hate musicals love. Whether or not you consider it 'the' finest musical ever created by Hollywood is, ultimately, a matter of personal preference; there are several contenders for that title, most notably MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, GIGI, and THE WIZARD OF OZ. But no matter where you personally rank it, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is certainly ONE of the best, a film that simply gains in critical and popular stature with every passing year, a national and a world treasure of cinematic art.Gary F.

"SalÃ², or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Incompetent, Pretentious, Self-Indulgent, and Incredibly Dull
","Pasolini is difficult for many to approach for the simple reason that so many of his defenders feel called upon to 'explain' his films. It is true that a great work of art is inexhaustible and that many of us would benefit from added information about it; in the case of Pasolini, however, the 'explanations' are considerably more interesting than the work itself, and this is particularly true of SALO, a film of notorious reputation.With SALO, Pasolini very freely adapts de Sade into a tale of young innocents kidnapped for use as sexual toys by the 'powerful but depraved' during World War II. In theory, the film is a 'metaphor' for the 'German rape of Italy.' In practice, it emerges as so much directorial self-importance and self-indulgence, badly structured in a highly obvious triptych style, badly scripted, badly performed, and badly filmed.It is also an incredibly slow film enlivened by the depiction of sexual abuse and torture, none of it greatly believable but all of it fairly distasteful. Those expecting an erotic tone will be disappointed; even so, certain images will linger in mind long after the film ends. The catch: the images that linger do so by reason of their extremely unpleasant nature.Pasolini was murdered not long after he made SALO and to this day rumors of a conspiracy abound. For myself, I strongly suspect that he was put out of his misery by movie-goers weary of his constant efforts to pass off his utter incompetence as a stylistic device.Gary F.

Eyes Wide Shut," Intriguing, But A Secret Kept Too Well
","EYES WIDE SHUT contains considerable nudity, several fairly explicit scenes, and one sexual situation after another. But any one who approaches EYES WIDE SHUT with the idea that it will be sexually arousing is in for an extremely rude awakening. EYES WIDE SHUT is not a sexy film, and (Hollywood marketing men aside) no one in their right mind would describe it as such.The story is intriguing. Upscale New York doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) fall into a drug-laced conversation--and goaded by Bill's rather archaic ideas about female sexuality, Alice reveals that she has had a powerful sexual fantasy about a man she once saw in a hotel. Powerful though the fantasy was, the facts of the matter are much more prosaic: she never spoke to him, never had sex with him, and never saw him again. But the authority with which she describes the fantasy, and the realization that women in general and his wife in particular are capable of contemplating such behavior, sends Bill into an emotional spin.Unable to shake the image of his wife having sex with another man, he prowls the city--and wanders more by accident than design into one sexual situation after another. Accosted by a patient, taunted by drunk men on the street who think he is gay, and even picked up by a prostitute, Bill eventually stumbles into the film's centerpiece: a secret society that gathers for cold-blooded and ritualistic fornication. And once he trespasses upon the society, he suddenly finds that death and destruction follow his every move.There are clearly several metaphors at work in the film. EYES WIDE SHUT essentially presents sex as something that boils under the surface with a ferocity of which we are generally unaware--and then by stages ties sexuality to emotional risk, disease, perversion, cruelty, and ultimately death. It is also flatly Strindbergian in its vision of women, presenting them and their sexuality as irrational elements that must be subdued and reduced to the mechanical lest they lead to absolute destruction. And it is no accident that the story is set at Christmas with its story of a male God born of a virgin woman.But these are only the most obvious of the film's layers. What confuses--and often enrages--viewers is the fact that Kubrick leaves a tremendous amount of wiggle room when it comes to both the story and what it means. There is no clear-cut summation re anything: everything is presented in the most ambivalent manner possible and we are left to draw our own conclusions. And this is as true of the plot as it is of whatever interpretation you attach to it; it winds back upon itself, ultimately frustrating any clear-cut response. One might say that with EYES WIDE SHUT Kubrick tantalizes us with a secret that he keeps entirely too well. I like the film, but people tend to have extremely divided reactions to it, and for that reason I recommend that you rent the film and decide for yourself before making a purchase.In theatrical release, EYES WIDE SHUT was presented in a widescreen ratio; on both VHS and DVD release, however, it is presented in the ratio of a standard television screen. Liner notes indicate that Kubrick intended the film to be seen in that ratio--but even if that is true it is a pity that there is not a widescreen option, for the visual statement of the widescreen theatrical release was somewhat more powerful. If you are trying to decide between DVD and VHS and both price and DVD bonus materials are factors in your choice, you should know that there is no significant difference between the two.Gary F.

A Beautiful Mind," Adept Performances Redeem Uneven Film
","Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and an strong supporting cast offer extraordinary performances in A BEAUTIFUL MIND--and fortunately so, for the subject of the film has undergone a Hollywood homogenization that renders the film both timid and tepid. Still worse, both script and direction are unfocused, and much of the film is taken up with a tricksy plot device calculated to manipulate viewers into an unexpected identification with Nash's mental illness.The plot device in question is one recently seen in a number of plot-driven films such as THE SIXTH SENSE and THE OTHERS; here, however, it proves extremely transparent and feels out of place, and since it requires the film to shift gears several times it contributes to the film's lack of flow. Moreover, it has the effect of presenting the nature of Nash's illness in very glossy terms that fail to really reflect the seriousness of his condition. It has 'santitized for your protection' feel typical of director Ron Howard's work.But when the cast has opportunity to shine it shines with considerable brilliance, and in spite of the film's numerous flaws the actors hold the attention from start to finish. I have never been a fan of Russell Crowe, and I found his performance in the earliest scenes a bit artificial, but he quickly comes to grips with the role and delivers a powerhouse performance that remains in mind long after the film ends. Jennifer Connelly is equally powerful as wife Alicia, and the supporting cast (which includes Ed Harris, Judd Hirsch, and Christopher Plummer) is extremely fine. This is not a great film, but it does contain great performances, and I recommend it on that basis.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,2,6,24 April 2005
Psycho," Room Service, Please
","Alfred Hitchcock guarded the plot of PSYCHO against publicity, and in 1960 audiences came to the film without being able to anticipate the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. More than forty years later, the movie's fame is such that even those who have not seen it are often able to sketch the basic outline of the story in a few words. This demonstrates the film's fame; what demonstrates it quality, however, is the fact that even those who know the plot before seeing it are seldom disappointed.Very loosely based on Robert Bloch's pulp novel, which was itself very loosely based on killer Ed Gein, PSYCHO presents us with the tale of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)--who, in a moment of madness, steals forty-thousand dollars. Running scared, Marion checks into the out-of-the-way Bates Motel. And there, as production notes for the recent DVD release gracefully state, she becomes the most grossly inconvenienced hotel guest in cinema history.The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a deluge of low budget and badly made films that commanded box office business via tawdry subject matter, and according to lore director Alfred Hitchcock was curious to see what might happen if he himself made such a film--but made it well. Working with a remarkable script and gifted cast and crew, the result was a masterpiece. Although it is often described as a horror film, PSYCHO is less horror than it is a study in paranoia and suspense, and certainly a lesson in the fact that one need not bother with graphic gore or big budgets to impress audiences.Much of the film's success is in its detail. Joseph Stephano's script is memorable for its repetition of verbal motifs and its extremely disquieting tone; Bernard Herrman's famous all-strings score builds tremendously upon it. The simple yet meticulous sets communicate building unease, and the strangely flat, semi-documentary black and white cinematography has a voyeuristic edge that is extremely disturbing.There are elements that can be justly criticized--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about. But in the end, this is the film for which Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin will forever be remembered... and one of the several films that will forever be associated with one of the twentieth century's most masterful directors.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,2,3,1 April 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Darkly Beautiful--But Sterile and Uninvolving
","Although it received generally positive reviews and proved a world-wide box office success, public reaction to the 1992 BRAM STOKER'S Dracula was significantly mixed. To a certain extent, this reaction was based on the film's slightly abstract, extremely operatic visual style--a style which seemed to overpower not only the actors but the actual story itself.Dracula has a spectacular visual design that mixes ideas about Victorian style with flamboyant color and ornate, border-line baroque detail that seems more suited to an Asian stage play than a film presumably set in 1890s England. The cinematography follows suit, using double and triple exposures, shared screen photography, and intense washes of color. The result is tremendously moody, both beautiful and ominous. It is also extremely distracting, and it tends to bury the actors, script, and story to such an extent that the film becomes less about these elements than about the mood and look inflicted upon them.At the time it was released, Dracula was touted as the first film version that was faithful to the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker--but this is not true, as any one who has read the novel can attest. The film has been deeply influenced by the Bela Lugosi film, the Boris Karloff THE MUMMY, and the 'Hammer Horror' vampire films of the 1960s; it explains how Dracula became a vampire, incorporates dollops of reincarnation, includes a very romantic subplot, and presents us with an ultimately sexy vampire--none of which exist in Stoker's novel. There is also considerable sex, and while this is a part of the original novel its power there arises from its subtextual nature; here it is rendered explicit and consequently seems less powerful than merely commonplace. Even so, the core story of Dracula's transition from Transylvannia to England, his attacks on Lucy and Mina, and his ultimate destruction remains much the same.The casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was a stroke of genius, but sad to say the production-heavy nature of the film doesn't allow them the necessary wiggle-room necessary to create the memorable performances you would expect. Winona Ryder seems very aptly cast as Mina, as does Sadie Frost as Lucy--but the script undercuts both, leaving Mina slightly chilly and Lucy excessively overheated. As for the eternally wooden Keanu Reeves, he lives up to his reputation as one of the least interesting actors of the era, delivering a memorably wooden performance.When the film delivers, it does so memorably, with the scene in which Lucy is laid to rest for once and all a case in point. But overall, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is not Bram Stoker, nor is it actually a cohesive variation: it simply a particularly exotic vision forced upon a story that doesn't support it. The result is often darkly beautiful, but it is also somewhat sterile and surprisingly uninvolving. The recent 'special edition' DVD actually undercuts the visual interest of the film; the transfer is dreadful. If you are a fan who wants the bonus material--and there is a goodly amount of it--you would do best to hang onto your original DVD copy as well, for it will be superior to the version offered here.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",6,0,1,3 February 2008
Stalag 17," Memorable Performances Highlight Sharp Comedy-Drama
","Although the play by Edmund Trzcinski and Donald Bevan had been a smash hit on Broadway, most insiders did not expect STALAG 17 to succeed as a film. The story concerned WWII American POWs held in a Nazi camp--but it combined serious drama with broad farce and offered one of the first anti-heroes in American film in the leading role. With the war still very fresh in every one's mind, the combination seemed more likely to offend than appeal. Every one concerned held their breath when the film debuted: would audiences get it? They did indeed, and STALAG 17 became one of the most critically-lauded and commercially popular films of the early 1950s, picking up an Academy Award nomination for director Billy Wilder and a Best Actor Oscar for William Holden in the process.The story concerns American prisoners of war held in the German 'Stalag 17' in 1944, and it begins grimly: after much planning, the Americans have devised an escape for two of their number, but the next morning the bullet-riddled bodies of the two men are dragged into camp and dumped in the mud. But the escape plan should have worked. It was perfect. How did the Germans know? Suspicion begins to settle on J.J. Sefton (Holden), a bitter cynic and hardbitten opportunist who spends his time running various scams designed to strip his fellow prisoners of what little they have.While this might have worked as drama pure and simple, the film counterbalances its darkness with streaks of a sort of 'boys will be boys' broad farce played out in the most over-the-top way imaginable. And strange to say, even given the overplaying typical of the early 1950s, the balance works: for every dramatic twist there is a stroke of comedy, and for every stroke of comedy there is a dramatic twist. In Wilder's hands the ensemble cast, which includes the likes of Otto Preminger and Peter Graves, performs some of the most remarkable juggling of the decade. But the glue here is William Holden. Interestingly, according to most sources Holden hated the play and hated the character and did the project under duress. Whatever the case, he gives a truly remarkable performance: Sefton is not a likable man by any stretch of the imagination, but even so he has certain self-integrity that you cannot help but admire. While Holden is now probably best remembered for his performances in SUNSET BLVD and NETWORK, his work here is likely the finest of his entire career.There has been some complaint that STALAG 17 is disrespectful to WWII prisoners of war, for it paints their Nazi captors as buffoons and camp conditions as not so much horrific as merely unpleasant--and it is true that the film makes no serious portray the extreme difficulties most POWs encountered. But to say that it is disrespectful to POWs is akin to saying that 42nd STREET is disrespectful to chorus girls: we know, just as 1953 audiences knew, that this is not an attempt to portray reality; it is instead a story told via our willing suspension of disbelief--and a very entertaining story it is indeed.

Platoon," What We Got Here Is A Crusader
","At the time it was released, PLATOON was said to be so realistic that many Vietnam vets who viewed it had psychotic flashbacks. My best friend, Randy, served two tours of duty in Vietnam in the late 1960s, and because of these reports he was hesitant to see the film. Ultimately he attended a screening in the company of some two dozen other vets who sat together to provide each other with support. When the film was over they looked at each other. 'Great film,' they said. 'But it wasn't like that. Not really.' Then they all went out for coffee and argued over some of the movie's technical details. Randy says he has never met any vet who had a flashback episode from viewing PLATOON, and he regards the story as so much Hollywood hype. Whether the stories of flashbacks are true or not, one thing is clear: PLATOON does not capture the Vietnam experience for all vets, and it seems unlikely that any one film ever could.Once we get past the film's reputation and actually look at it, what we have is an extremely well-done film that posits itself as 'typical Vietnam experience' and then offers us an not-very-subtle morality tale. Although the film focuses on newly arrived soldier Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), the storyline focuses on the battle of wills between an ultra-hawk faction led by Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) who don't care who they kill and an ultra-dove faction led by Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who want to maintain some sort of sense of humanity and self-respect. The factions soon erupt into an internal war, with Berenger increasingly portrayed as a demon from the pit and Dafoe seen as a Christ-like figure, both symbolically fighting for the soul of young and impressionable Sheen.In terms of combat scenes and violence, PLATOON is less horrific than you might expect. There are shockers, of course, but the film achieves its effect less from graphic violence than from suspense, and here it is extremely successful. Interestingly, the film also contains a covertly homo-erotic edge quite unlike that of any war film I've ever seen. When the characters talk about women, they refer to them as objects and the few women who appear in the film are targets of rape and murder, so the film equates heterosexuality with violence; on the other hand, it is impossible to escape the connotation of the scene in which Sheen is introduced to (i.e. seduced by) drugs in Dafoe's lair, which comes complete with party music, twinkle lights, and such lines as 'put your mouth on this.' Although the black-and-white nature of the story is simplistic almost to the point of annoyance, a truly fine cast carries the film off extremely well. Sheen is actually the weak link here: although appropriately All-American-Good-Boy he is not greatly memorable. Dafoe, however, is astonishingly good, and although very one note Berenger is a powerful metaphor for evil. The supporting cast includes exceptional performances from the likes of Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon (particularly effective as the loathsome 'Bunny'), and even a very young Johnny Depp. But Oliver Stone's direction and script has a 'crusader' mentality that undercuts any complexity the film would have, and PLATOON ultimately emerges as determinedly anti-war to the point of propaganda; consequently it never digs as deep as you feel it should. But what the film does do, it does extremely well. Recommended, but keep your critical faculties fully engaged throughout.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,1,3,17 May 2005
The Queen," Inside The Gilded Cage
","At an early point in THE QUEEN, Prince Charles comments that the Princess Diana known to the royal family and the Princess Diana known to the people are two entirely different entities. It is an astute observation, and much the same might be said of Queen Elizabeth II herself, a woman who has spent most of her life upholding the dignities, responsibilities, and duties of the crown regardless of her personal sentiments--and who has worked remarkably hard to keep those sentiments out of the public eye.THE QUEEN focuses on the week following Princess Diana's fatal car crash, and Princess Diana's presence broods over the film in the form of actual news footage. But THE QUEEN focuses on Elizabeth, and as presented here she is a woman whose life has been dominated by the discipline required of her office. She has authority, wealth, and privilege of such degree that it is far, far beyond the scope of all but handful to imagine, much less understand. At the same time, however, she is a prisoner in a gilded cage; few moments are hers alone, and only her iron-clad will upholds her in the face of the demands of her office.It not therefore surprising that upon Diana's death Elizabeth instantly sets aside her own emotions and moves forward inside the code of conduct that has dominated her entire life. Even her concerns for her grandsons must take second place to the demands of her office, and in this instance she determines that the office demands the same stability she has always offered to her people: a calm and unruffled visage and adherence to the meticulous protocol that has shaped her entire life. This proves a great miscalculation. The public, enamored of Diana, interprets this as indicative of royal indifference.Very little can be said of Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II which has not already been said. It is brilliant and quite possibly unequaled in its recreation and interpretation of such a well-known and still-living figure. It is perfectly balanced by Michael Sheen in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose habitual informality offers a perfect counter-balance, and the remarkable efforts of those cast as the royals: James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms, Alex Jennings, and Helen McCrory, who play Prince Philip, The Queen Mother, Prince Charles, and Cherie Blair respectively. The tone of the film is cool, graceful, elegant, and indeed stately--and although this might have emerged as dull in other hands, it builds to a remarkable climax in the hands of Stephen Frears.The one occasionally questionable note is the script by Peter Morgan. In one sense, it is remarkably resourceful, managing to include considerable detail; in another, however, it is extremely obvious. I was occasionally troubled by the thought that, had it not been fueled by the miraculous performances of the cast, it would have drifted into triteness. This is particularly the case in terms of character shifts, which occasionally seem unexpected and which occasionally go nowhere in particular.It would be interesting to know what the royals and the Blairs think of the film. At present there has been--in typical Buckingham Palace style--little or no comment. The Queen herself has only noted that, given that it focuses upon a particularly painful time, she has no desire to see it. In terms of quality, the DVD is quite good without being dazzling. Bonuses include a short and generally interesting, if not particularly deep, 'making of' documentary and two audio commentaries: one by director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan, which is good, and one by royal expert Robert Lacey, which is better still. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",9,0,0,10 June 2007
Blade Runner," A Triumph of Style of Substance
","To say BLADE RUNNER is an incredible looking film is a gross understatement.The art direction--whether costume, scenic design, or special effects--is simply stunning, creating an extremely dark, sometimes beautiful, but always fascinating vision of a future Los Angeles that has begun to collapse into grotesque decay. Hardcore science fiction fans will instantly recognize that the city's spectacular highrises reference Fritz Lang's silent METROPOLIS; art history buffs should notice a distinct Frank Lloyd Wright tinge to some of the set designs; costume designs are clearly intended to evoke the spirit of 1940s film noir. The resulting melange is simply extraordinary, very powerful, and incredibly atmospheric.The cast gives able, stylish performances in keeping with the film's dark but glossy tone, but the script they play is a very muddy one. The story concerns a special agent (Harrison) who is assigned the task of locating and 'retiring' (i.e. killing) a handful of violent androids who have illegally landed on earth. While I greatly admire the film's decidedly 'open-ended' conclusion, I do not greatly admire the on-going vagueness that besets the storyline as a whole.We are persistently asked to ask believe that Harrison Ford locates his quarry via the vaguest information imaginable; moreover, although specifically described as a highly experienced and formidable agent, Ford's character gives little evidence of it: he's always being bashed around to the point of death and then overcoming his opponent more through dumb luck than superior skill. Most annoying of all, the film flirts with issues concerning creation of artificial life without actually amplifying any of them in a consistently engaging way.In spite of these failings, the performances and most particularly the incredibly compelling make BLADE RUNNER a fantastic triumph of style over substance. It is extremely enjoyable, and it is easy to understand how the film has drawn so many enthusiastic fans.The DVD presently available is a 'director's cut' version and offers both widescreen and modified-for-television formats. The former is recommended, for the latter undercuts the visual fascination of the film. The picture quality of the widescreen format is superior; the sound is good but not exceptional. Aside from the choice of formats and brief biographies of the principal players, there are no extras of any kind.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,5,9,1 August 2005
Signs," Much To Enjoy, But Somehow Short of the Mark
","In a documentary that accompanies the film on DVD, M. Night Shyamalan admits that SIGNS was greatly influenced by such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS--an admission that will come as no surprise to any one who has seen SIGNS in the wake of those films. Although very different, all three have one thing in common: they ultimately focus on a small group of people fighting off an unnatural entity that attempts to invade their very ordinary homes.The story is an unusual mix of meditative religious and classic sci-fi elements blended together by Shyamalan's remarkable sense of visual style. Mel Gibson is a minister who has lost his faith in the wake of his wife's tragic accidental death and who now rejects the concept of unseen powers entirely--so he is nonplussed when his children discover a crop circle in his own cornfield. He remains skeptical even as television news coverage reports alien crafts hovering over major cities. But his denial is exploded when he and his family have a close encounter of the extremely nasty kind.The small cast is extremely, extremely good. I generally dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, but he has grown a bit since his macho-bravado BRAVEHEART days, and while he might seem an unlikely choice for the part of a failed minister he carries it extremely well. Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as Gibson's younger brother, and the children--Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin--are flawless.What isn't flawless is the story. The blend of religious and sci-fi motifs is an interesting idea, but director Shyamalan (who also wrote the script) doesn't quite manage to hold them in balance, and ultimately winds up beating you over the head with the film's religious elements while giving the sci-fi elements the short end of the stick. I did appreciate the fact that the film builds suspense more by what it does not show than what it does, and I have no qualm with that--it's a welcome choice after such special effects overkill as INDEPENDENCE DAY and the like--but several of his plot devices smack of stereotype, and the film's conclusion is such a deus ex machina that it is not to be believed. There is indeed a great deal to admire about the film, but when all is said and done it somehow lacks sincerity and falls just short of the mark. Entertaining nonetheless.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",7,53,106,18 April 2005
The Deer Hunter," A Deeply Flawed Masterpiece
","THE DEER HUNTER opens with a long and complex sequence depicting events surrounding an elaborate wedding in the Polish-American community of a steel mill town--and then vaults several of that community's young men into a hellish vision of the Vietnam war, from which the survivors return so completely changed that they no longer fit into the community from which they originally came.There are several critical issues with THE DEER HUNTER. When it was first released, audiences were very positive about the film--but they complained about the opening 'home town' sequence, which they described as slow and over-long. The studio accordingly edited the sequence to half its original length--but when the edited version was shown, audiences were considerably less enthusiastic about the film, and the edited portion was restored.Today audiences still complain about the opening sequence, seldom realizing that it provides the point of comparison that makes the remainder of the film so powerful--and in any case, this fact is something that can only be recognized by viewers in hindsight, a circumstance that does not help them weather the first portion of the movie when they actually see it. Many also complain that the plot is improbable. Once the three leads (Robert De Niro, John Savage, and Christopher Walken) reach Vietnam, they are unexpectedly reunited just in time to be captured and tortured together. In the film's most famous scene, the three are forced to play Russian roulette against each other--and although they escape, one is maimed (Savage) and the other (Walken) so emotionally traumatized that he vanishes into Vietnamese underworld, where he re-enacts the horror of his torture by playing Russian roulette as a gambling game.But for all its glitchiness, THE DEER HUNTER is a remarkably intense, remarkably disturbing film--particularly when the discharged De Niro returns home only to find himself surrounded by old friends whose 'broads and beer' lives seem incredibly trivial in comparison to his own experience. He has changed; they have not; what has been lost cannot be recovered. But there can be a sort of redemption through an acceptance of the change that has been forced upon him--and by trying to bring others who have suffered to that same acceptance.Cimino's direction and overall vision is loose, to say the least, but he draws extraordinary performances from an extraordinary cast. De Niro gives what may be the most subtle performance of his entire career in this film. Christopher Walken's performance (he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar) is justly famous, and although often overlooked, John Savage is every bit his equal; Meryl Streep is also memorable in one of her earliest big-screen roles. And bitter as the film is, it still speaks of honor, integrity, hope, and bonds of friendship and community that can never be broken. Deeply flawed--but a masterpiece nonetheless.Gary F.

Rear Window," Voyeurism Never Looked So Good
","Released in 1954, REAR WINDOW was a major success with critics and public alike--and unlike some Hitchcock films, which were praised at the time but negatively re-evaluated, it has held up incredibly well over time.Loosely suggested by several notorious crimes, the premise of REAR WINDOW is widely famous. Photographer L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his New York apartment with a broken leg, alternately nursed and harassed by his elegant girl friend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and pragmatic day nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter.) Annoyed and bored, he begins to watch his neighbors across the courtyard--and soon notices the activities of Mr. and Mrs. Thorwald (Raymond Burr and Irene Winston.) Their quarrels quite suddenly cease, Mrs. Thorwald is no longer visible, and Mr. Thorwald is unexpectedly given to taking packages out of the house. Is it murder? The set for REAR WINDOW has long garnered a great deal of attention, and deservedly so: it is a meticulous sound stage re-creation of New York apartment buildings of the era, and with few exceptions both the camera work and sound effects are presented from Jefferies' point of view: we see what he sees and hear what he hears. In the process, we become as much of a peeping tom as Jefferies himself, a device that tends to make audiences increasingly squirm as the film progresses. At the same time, however, we are also privy to Jefferies' private life, most particularly his rocky relationship with Lisa, who wants marriage but whom Jefferies rejects as incompatible with his own lifestyle.The performances here are extraordinary, with James Stewart cast against type as Jefferies and Grace Kelly sparkling as the high-fashion Lisa. But the real stunner is the supporting cast, which ranges from the truly remarkable Thelma Ritter to the host of players who are glimpsed from Jefferies' window as they go about their daily routines: the lonely lady, the musician, the newly married couple, the sculptor, the woman with the dog--and, of course, 'Miss Torso,' a particularly voluptuous blonde who spends her time in what Lisa calls 'a woman's hardest job: juggling wolves!' This is Hitchcock working at the peak of his talents, working his themes of isolation, vulnerability, and most particularly voyeurism to the nth degree. The script is tight, the cinematography is flawless, and the production designs are beyond perfection. Critics may argue which film can be regarded as Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece, but even the most picky among them will place REAR WINDOW either at or very near the top slot--and so will you. Truly memorable and beautifully restored on this DVD release. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,0,1,3 February 2008
Casino," Low Life in the High Life
","I worked for a Mississippi casino at the time this film hit the big screen. Obviously, there are tremendous differences between Las Vegas casinos of the 1970s and Biloxi casinos of the 1990s--but even so I was stunned by the accuracy with which Scorsese's CASINO nailed the industry and the personalities that inhabit it. From the slick hair and pin stripe suits to the endless profanity to the count room to the surveillance room, CASINO is uncomfortably close to the truth.Based on the life of 'Lefty' Rosenthal, CASINO offers the story of Las Vegas' last gasp of mob domination before the big corporations began to move in. Robert De Niro is 'Ace' Rothstein, a mob-connected gambler who rises to control of one the biggest mob-owned casinos in town--and then sees his control slips away through his misplaced love for beautiful and brazen Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and his association with gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci.) And when their various activities begin to draw heat on the mob bosses, can murder be far behind? The cast is really top notch. De Niro and Pesci offer memorable performances, as does a superior supporting cast that includes James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, and Melissa Prophet, to name but a few--but the real laurels go to Sharon Stone, who plays out the rise and fall of the glamorous Ginger with surprising skill. But even so, and in spite of its memorable cast, dialogue, plot, and production values, CASINO has a slightly awkward feel to it. Part of the problem is the film's inconsistent reliance on voice-over narration that shifts uneasily between De Niro and Pesci; part of the problem is the film's uneasy shifting between love story and gangster movie. And in the final analysis the film seems overlong.For all its flaws, CASINO is an extremely watchable, very memorable movie that stands up very well on its own in spite of inevitable comparisons to GOODFELLAS. In passing, I note the DVD package has few extras, and most viewers will be as happy with the VHS version as with the DVD. But be it DVD or VHS, the film is strongly recommended.Gary F.

Ran," A Masterwork By A Master Artist
","Born in 1910 Japan, Akira Kurosawa first studied painting before moving into film in the late 1930s. A well-known director in Japan throughout the 1940s, his 1950 production of RASHOMON launched him to international acclaim--and throughout the remainder of his long career he was widely acknowledged as among the world's greatest film directors, the creator of such films as THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD, and YOJIMBO. Released in 1985, RAN would be among his final films and is generally felt to be among his finest.Kurosawa often borrowed plot lines from Western literature, and with RAN--the Japanese word translates loosely as chaos--he lifted the basic story from William Shakespeare's KING LEAR. In Kurosawa's retelling, the Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) divides his kingdom between three sons: Taro (Akira Terao), Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu). When youngest son Saburo upbraids his father for foolishness, Hidetora banishes him--only to find Taro and Jiro turning against him just as Saburo predicted. Kurosawa shapes the Shakespearean story to 16th Century Japan, so it would be easy to belabor comparison with the original; at the same time, however, it is worth pointing out that he actually captures the story more effectively than any western filmmaker has to date.As in many Kurosawa films, RAN alternates moments of great stillness with rapacious action, enclosed spaces with wide vistas. In stillness, the film focuses upon its actors and their intrigues--perhaps most notably the perfidious Lady Kaede, a truly dark character frighteningly realized by actress Mieko Harada. Indeed, all the cast is remarkably fine. But the great centerpiece, and the great performance, of the film is Tatsuya Nakadai's Lord Hidetora, whose mixture of good intention and folly leads first to humiliation and then to madness. Perhaps the single most stunning moment of the film occurs when Hidetora, betrayed by his sons, walks down the tower steps of the third castle following a vicious battle. It is difficult to imagine many actors who could perform such a scene; it is equally difficult to imagine many directors who could stage it.Few directors are able to convey the sense of chaos, destruction, and fear with which Kurosawa endows battle scenes, and RAN is no exception. There are several, and the battle of the third castle (in which Hidetora is bested by sons Taro and Jiro) is easily among the finest battle sequences of Kurosawa's career. Presented without any sound except a simple, eloquent music score, flash-cutting between different groups in the struggle, the result is a unique mixture of beauty and horror--and in my opinion unequaled by any other film I've seen.It should be noted that RAN, unlike RASHOMON, THRONE OF BLOOD, YOJIMBO and many other Kurosawa films, is in color. I have long been used to the remarkable shading of Kurosawa's black and white films, and I missed it--but only for a moment. Kurosawa proves no less adept in color than in black and white, and RAN's use of color is remarkable. For this reason I particularly recommend the Criterion Collection edition of the film over any other; it is very fine. But regardless of the particular version, this is a film which must be seen by any one who appreciates Asian or world cinema, truly a masterwork by a great master.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,3,7,10 June 2007
The Birds," More A Series Of Set Pieces Than A Coherent Film; Fascinating Nonetheless
","Time has a way of qualifying our initial assessment of films, and this is particularly true of films made by director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980.) Throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded as a solid craftsman but not an artist; in the 1950s many of his films, most notoriously VERTIGO, were received with lukewarm interest. In the 1960s, however, attitudes about his work began to change, and with that came a major re-evaluation of his films. Films that had been earlier dismissed were recognized as great classics; some films that had received tremendous recognition at the time of their release were now seen as somewhat over-praised.To a certain extent this re-evaluation continues today, and at this point one film in particular proves extremely contentious to critics: THE BIRDS, which was considered both extremely innovative and a great shocker in 1963 but which is now teetering on the brink of critical dismissal. Just as it took some thirty years to fix VERTIGO's position in the Hitchcock lexicon, so may it take fifty to arrive at a final summation here.According to film lore, Hitchcock was intrigued by a newspaper story about a 'bird attack,' and his interest in the story gradually evolved into THE BIRDS. (Although technically based on the 1952 novella by Dauphne du Maurier, the story and film bear little relation to each other.) The story developed by Hitchcock and Evan Hunter concerned slightly wild San Francisco socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who becomes infatuated with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and whimsically follows him to his home at Bodgea Bay as a prank. Not long after her arrival, however, she is attacked by a seagull, and although her injuries are slight she is quickly, albeit somewhat unwillingly, received by Mitch and his circle. One attack soon leads to another, and before very long Melanie, Mitch, and the entire community are under siege.THE BIRDS is primarily famous for the sheer number of disconcerting and often stunning set ups it creates for the birds' attacks. Two of these are particularly famous. While Melanie sits on a bench outside the grade school, her attention is attracted by a flying bird--and she turns to find the playground's jungle gym covered with crows, assembling for an attack as the children leave the school. Later, when the birds attack the town itself, Melanie is trapped in a telephone booth, a helpless witness to the horrors around her even as the birds begin to batter the glass that protects her.But the sheer brilliance of these set pieces is off-set by the overall film itself. Stories and scripts of Hitchcock films are usually very tight and very precise, but where THE BIRDS is concerned you could drive a Mac Truck through the gaps. It is much easier to 'suspend disbelief' re the bird attacks than it is to accept the way in which the characters behave throughout the film. This is not actually the fault of the cast, which ranges from serviceable to excellent, but rather of the way the film works (or more specifically, doesn't work) as a whole. Having made up her mind to play a prank on Mitch, how is it that Melanie can't come up with a better one? Why evacuate the children into open air instead of an interior room? Why search for the source of a sound, alone no less, when you know what the source must be? Hitchcock apologists tend to justify these and many other loose ends in the film by stating that THE BIRDS is intended to have an open-ended structure without resolution and that the random and often incomprehensible nature of the script is intended to reflect the random and incomprehensible nature of the bird attacks. A typical argument in favor of the film also notes that the film is driven by themes instead of plot points. Well-- maybe. But I'm an 'art film' fan myself, and I can't see it.In the final analysis, THE BIRDS is more akin to modern ultra-commercial action and adventure films than it is to an art-film, with the action and adventure distracting you from the holes in the thing--including the fact that the film is surprising slow. Even so, while THE BIRDS has major flaws, it is so crammed with iconographic moments and visuals that it is impossible to completely dismiss the film as a commercial wallow pure and simple. At its best, THE BIRDS has an incredibly high level of artistry, and those moments really do carry the film and impress themselves in your mind in a most remarkable way. I offer my own experience as an example. I first saw THE BIRDS on television when I was a teenager, and although I thought it was entertaining enough I wasn't particularly impressed. The next morning, however, I opened the living room curtains--startled a flock of birds perched on the outside window sill--and I was scared half to death. And that's cinematic power, nothing else.The DVD presents the film in excellent form and includes several bonuses, most particularly Hitchcock's darkly humorous movie trailer and outlines of a deleted scene. Final comment: it's extremely uneven, but it is also extremely powerful. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8,1,2,3 February 2008
The Simpsons Movie," 'How Did The Pig Tracks Get On The Ceiling?'
","Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie original debuted as super-short spots on the popular TRACEY ULLMAN SHOW in 1987--and proved so popular that they soon graduated to their own series, THE SIMPSON, on Fox. A mixture of zany action and pop culture satire, the show was a huge hit--and some twenty years later is still going strong.THE SIMPSONS MOVIE finds the family in their usual spate of comic chaos, including Grandpa's prophecy at church and Homer's acquisition of a pet pig. Unfortunately, when Homer dumps a silo full of pig crap into Lake Springfield, rendering it toxic, he attracts the attention of the EPA and makes Grandpa's prophecy come true. Is Springfield domed? Er, doomed? There's a lot to like about THE SIMPSONS MOVIE. It's well crafted, the characters have lots of off-the-wall bits, and when it scores it scores big. But series fan who complain that the series has lost some steam over the years have a point: although its amusing and clever and lots of fun, The Simpsons just don't have the same bite they did back in the day--and this is as true of the film as it is of the series. It's more akin to the pop culture it mocks than to the satire-sharp show it used to be.The DVD release, which is available in both full screen and widescreen, comes with several bonuses. The audio tracks are inconsistently interesting, but the rest is enjoyable. D'oh! GFT, Amazon Reviewer",7,0,0,3 February 2008
The Wizard of Oz," OZ: A Grown Up's Movie That Kids Enjoy
","THE WIZARD OF OZ is a paradox: although made with a juvenile audience in mind, the completed film has an unexpectedly adult sensibility, and children enjoy it on one level while adults find it a considerably more complex experience. Like most fairy tales, OZ deals in archetypes--but instead of merely referencing them, OZ specifies them in a uniquely literal way and transforms them into a brilliantly beautiful yet extremely menacing tale of innocence lost. It is a surprisingly psychological film, and any one foolish enough to scratch its surface will soon find themselves dealing with more 'isms' than a roomful of research psychiatrists could explain.Fancy 'isms' aside, OZ is a tremendous amount of fun. For one thing, it MOVES: the story begins with a tone of breathless anticipation, and the film somehow manages to maintain that level of energy throughout its entire running time with never a lag. Although one or two of the famed special effects seem a bit dated, most are still exciting. This is particularly true of the famous tornado sequence, the first half of which (in which Dorothy races the storm home) still outstrips any special effects storm footage made to date. The look of the film, from the rich sepia tones of a painfully literal Kansas to the Technicolor vibrancy of a very surrealistic Oz, is as artful as a dozen famous painters rolled into one--and need we really mention the music, so famous that virtually every man, woman, and child in the western world can hum most of the score?But all of this would be by-the-way if not for a truly amazing cast. Judy Garland is a remarkable Dorothy, with one foot in innocent childhood wonder and the other as firmly planted in a very sophisticated and extremely adult sense of humor (watch her very subtle series of double-takes during the Munchkin sequence), and the success of the film largely rests upon the success of her own performance. But this in no way disparages the rest of the cast, which plays broadly but with considerable self-depreciating humor; every one is sure to have their own favorite among the famous performances by Bolger, Lahr, Haley, Hamilton, Burke, and Morgan, and all are equally brilliant.Although the original MGM DVD (now out of print) has been greatly praised, the Warner Bros. DVD is the widely available standard. Whatever its failings in comparison to the MGM DVD, it offers picture and sound quality far beyond anything seen on any VHS. There are also a number of extra bells and whistles that range from the very interesting, such as the Angela Lansbury-hosted documentary on the making of the film, to the ho-hum, such as old newspaper advertisements for the film. But whatever the merits of these extras, the real reason to buy the DVD is for the film itself: THE WIZARD OF OZ is as timeless, fascinating, disturbing, and beautiful today as it ever was and probably will always be. Put the kids to bed and watch the film with a critical eye--and you'll be amazed at what you've missed.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10,3,5,20 August 2005
