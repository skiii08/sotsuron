The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I wish it could affect me like it has many others
","Although 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' was a very good film, there's just too big of a rift between the relatability that it invites and the unbelievability it presents for me to consider it 'the defining picture of today.' Archetypes too typical, occasional scoff-worthy dialogue, and misspent character traits bog it down from god-tier. And some of the directing/ editing choices didn't help. I liked it, to be sure, but I've BEEN THERE (a sentiment the story is designed to evoke from everybody) and it /still/ hardly moves me. I get bothered not because the movie was sad but because the movie should have been sad to me and my un-tugged heartstrings really upset me when so much earnest effort is put into it without significant result.",7,1,2,12 November 2012
Annie Hall," Touching and Humorous
","Woody Allen's brilliance is on full display here, in a picture widely considered his pinnacle work. It's easy to see why. THIS is what I call a romantic comedy. One of the most consistently funny flicks I've ever seen, featuring characteristically sharp writing and a cast which delivers stellar performances from even the smallest roles. I enjoyed the very 40s-esque static shots and 4th-wall-breaking dialog close ups, which is significant considering I usually prefer more dynamic camera movement in my motion pictures.Final Word: Annie Hall is worth your time if you've ever been in love, or ever wanted to be.",9,0,0,11 November 2012
