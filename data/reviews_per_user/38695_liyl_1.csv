Howl's Moving Castle," My favourite animated film ever
","Honestly this film is so amazing,every time i pause the film,the scene can be used as my wallpaper,the animation is just so gorgeous.The story is quite unique but every story that has elements of magic in it is bound to be unique in my opinion.This is seriously a beautiful movie,10/10 would recommend.",10,1,2,22 September 2019
