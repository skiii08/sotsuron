Howl's Moving Castle," I can't explain it it was so good!!!
","This movie is a work of art. It is beautifully illustrated and the characters are well planned. I recommend this film to any family needing something fun to watch. Hayao Miyazaki has made another great creation.Howl is very well drawn and beautifully animated. He is a great part ofthe movie. Sophie is a good character and it is interesting when she gets hit bythe curse to make her into an elderly woman. My favorite character is Calcifer. He is well played by Billy Crystal.He has a funny snotty attitude and makes me laugh. I can't wait to see this film again! You really need to watch this film, anime fan or not. Totally awesome, Hayao Miyazaki! I can't wait for the next film!",10,0,1,17 March 2012
Twilight," I think Stephenie Meyer would be happy.
","This movie wasn't as good as the book, but it probably made Stephenie Meyer happy. I think this is a really good way to introduce the modern, romantic, vampire that has evolved from the days of Dracula and Kali. And every single vampire has a different personality. Alice likes everything to be pretty and is a happy vampire. Jasper is quiet but really has a thirst for human blood, unlike his partner, Alice. Emmett is incredibly strong and manly and Rosalie loves romance and wanted to get married and have children (which wouldn't be hard for her because she is supposed to be very beautiful). And Edward is kind and likes to read minds. Overall, this was a good movie.",8,2,7,23 June 2012
