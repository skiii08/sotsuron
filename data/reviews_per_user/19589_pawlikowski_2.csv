Black Swan," Starts Tense and Goes Nowhere
","I give this film credit for showing what it's like backstage in Ballet or in any of the performing arts. For every hour of dazzling performance, there are hundreds of hours of work, sweat and tears. It takes a lot of effort to look effortless.I will also congratulate the cinematographers - the camera work, especially the camera work showing balletic movement is terrific - you can almost feel what it's like to turn, jump and be lifted in space - bravo to them.The story is the problem. A psychological thriller that's not particularly thrilling. You can predict the outcome about the third time you see the character Nina confront herself in the mirror - which is probably not ten minutes into the film.Internal conflicts brought on by an overbearing mother, a demanding career, and facing the short lived career of a ballerina (few dancers dance professionally beyond their mid-30's), bring our heroine to a crisis that parallels her character as the Swan Queen.We watch Nina spiraling out of control, but the story has all the surprise of high school physics experiment.This ground has been covered many, many times (the 1978 movie 'Magic', comes to mind). And it's been done better.It's worth watching for the ballet fans out there - there aren't enough ballet movies. Otherwise, fly by the 'Black Swan'.For an internal conflict, psychological thriller, I'd recommend 'Momento', starring Guy Pierce.",4,16,27,16 January 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," After the buzz...
","Saw this a year after it's general release. I don't know if it's because I saw it at home instead of in a theater, or if I had already been exposed to the Borat shtick, but I didn't find this film worthwhile.It's best when the Borat character is interacting with people one-on-one. Genuinely funny scenes with a comedy instructor and a driving instructor, and to a lesser extent at the dinner party scene.Still, the film relies too much on shock humor. This has two primary sources - scatological references (eg, we see Borat relieving himself in some small bushes on a busy Manhattan street, and a very graphic male nude wrestling sequence), and prejudicial references, primarily to women, gays and Jews.There are some redeeming moments, and one could make the case that the movie shows Borat's prejudices are America's prejudices, and that all prejudice is worthy of ridicule - but I doubt the target audience would tune into the message.Appropriate for the male dorm room set, otherwise, best left on the shelf.",4,2,5,19 January 2008
