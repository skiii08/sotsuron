Scarface," The best gangster movie of all time.
","Tony Montana. He is the hardest man to have ever appeared on the big screen. He is the toughest anti-hero of all time. This is Al Pacino's biggest role. The role he was born to play. Scarface is an gangster epic, taking place in the early 1980s in Miami. Tony Montana, is a Cuban coming to the United States looking for money, and glory. One of the most frightening things about Scarface is how true it tells the story, of failed integration in the Western world. It's a perfect example of exactly WHY so many foreigners decides to become criminals. Perhaps thats the biggest point of Scarface.But besides that, the movie gave birth to one of the most memorable characters ever, Tony Montana. Each second that Al, is on screen, he captures the audience. He really makes the viewer think that he is the good guy, even though he is a cold and cynical killer. Oliver Stones harsh script, is certainly not for all ages. Scarface is much more though than just flashy blood and a lot of cursing. Scarface, along with Michael Mann's 1984 cult classic Cop TV series, Miami Vice, represents the 80s through cinema. In the colorful streets of Miami, with the warm sun, the neon lights, the flashy suit, the big hair and the crazy disco pop music, the 80s is brought to life. It's the decade everyone loves to hate. It's that decade that makes you smile. The cheesy and materialistic decade, that yet was innocent and a time full of joy. In a way, the setting of Miami reinforces the cynical aspect of Tonys behavior. It's dark, bloody and gritty in a bright and colorful world.'I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.' - Tony. Thats right Tony. You mates, better go out and buy the DVD, because Scarface is one you just HAVE to own. It's a fact of life.9/10",9,0,1,22 December 2005
Akira," Every Anime fan have to start from a certain place.
","I was probably around 8, when I first saw Akira. It was my step dad who asked me if I was interested in watching this Japanese cartoon. I expected something like, my favorite children movies like The Lion King or The Land before Time.Akira however, was something else. At the time I was to young to understand English, since it was a second language for me. But I remember what kind of an affect it had on me. It was brutal, it was hard, it was edgy. The drums and Neo Tokyo lights flew through my little body as butter, as I witnessed death, gore and sadistic killings. Something my pure and innocent eyes had never seen before. And yet I was strangely excited. I was never tough as a kid. I was a afraid of the dark and often had nightmares about all kinds of things. But Akira, despite it's mature nature, just had me in awe. When I finally re-saw it many years later, when I was an old teenager, I was still in awe.Akira is simply a wonderful and entertaining sci-fi movie. It was what introduced me to anime, and innovation in a hole new way. If you want to start watching anime or see, what all the fuss is about, then Akira is a good place to start. Even though it's over 17 years old today, it is still a fantastic and visually stunning animation. Even if you don't appreciate animation you owe it to yourself, to check it out. It has spectacular action, motorcycle-chase-sequences, mad scientists and tons of blood and shooting.8/10",8,46,79,22 December 2005
Oldboy," Oh Dae-Su is my favorite hero...
","After watching this movie, I felt out jumping out the window and hurt some random people with a steel hammer, just because of sheer excitement. I don't know about you're social life's, but in mine that is a pretty uncommon feeling. I can't say that I have ever had that feeling before, and I don't mean that in any negative way(except for does who were to get hit by my mighty steel hammer). Oldboy is extreme, provoking and over the top. It's a typical revenge story, but it just gets so much more under your skin, than something like Kill Bill. Even if you're one of does people who don't like foreign movies, you shouldn't pass the chance of seeing Oldboy. It does something that Hollywood wouldn't dare in ten million years. No matter who you are, I guarantee you, that you will at the very worst, have absolutely appreciated, having had the chance to see this unique movie. If you don't, then you are welcome to hit me with a big steel hammer.9/10",9,5,71,22 December 2005
Man on Fire," Buy Man on Fire on DVD, or Denzel will break your legs.
","Every once in a while(about once in a decade) a movie comes along that makes what seem like just another film with car explosions and people getting shot full of holes, like an stinky cheese, turn into an true action epic. I will confess something. Man on Fire made me cry like a little schoolgirl. It's an epic and emotional film, that can't do anything besides growing on you. Denzel plays the tough macho bodyguard alcoholic with a harsh past full of regret and death. His client, Samuel, played by Mark Anthony(a surprisingly very good performance, even though I dislike his music) wants him to protect their daughter, Pita(Dakota Fanning) in the harsh Mexico. While their relationship starts off stiff, Denzel can't do nothing but eventually dry up, to the cute and life-happy Pita. But as in any good action movie, the bad guys just can't keep their fingers of the cookie jar. The premise or plot Tony Scotts latest, is nothing new or even surprising, but it's incredible powerful execution makes up for it. Harry Greg-Williams amazing score, helps keeping the movie very intense and deep. This is without a doubt, the best Tony Scott movie ever. With this, he is getting very close to Ridley Scott, who has long mastered the concept of epic films. This is a movie you definitely should be seeing. It has everything you could want. Amazing music, great acting, competent directing and stunning action. 9/10",9,4,6,22 December 2005
Princess Mononoke," One of the most epic Animes of all time.
","Based on old Japanese mythology and folklore, in ages past, Mononoke-Hime, tells the tail of the young prince, Ashitaka, who in the beginning of the film confronts a vicious demon. Even though he defeated the demon, he was cursed. To try and save himself, he decided to travel west, to try and lift the curse, so he wouldn't die. And that is the beginning of Hayao's biggest masterpiece, Mononoke-Hime is about. Though it also has tons of other themes as well. It's a movie with a very strong point and very solid believable characters. You will truly want to care about, what happens to them.The movie is full of action, beautiful hand drawn and colorful animation as well as stunning music and excellent voice acting. Of course, the Japanese voices are far superior to the English one, based on my personal preference. One of the things that Mononoke does best, is to tell the story in an epic way. We get to see animal gods and different points of view, from one conflict, without it seeming childish or stupid. This movie, is of my all time favorites. You just have to watch it. It's a true work of art. A hallmark in Animation and movies in general.9/10",9,1,3,22 December 2005
