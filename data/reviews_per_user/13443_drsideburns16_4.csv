Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Nooo! Tarantino, what have you done, man?
","Why, Tarantino? Why have you done this? I loved the first one. Absolutely loved Vol. 1. I wanted to love 2. I saw it in what could be the best considered cirumstances, and I sincerely believe it would have been a better night had I not seen it (and seen Crank instead.) So much talking, so much bullcrap, not enough cuttin dudes up. Uma gets shot but she punches her way out of a coffin and there's an old Asian dude with glued-on eyebrows... The yellowbook guru guy turned out to be Bill...She even ditched the Pussy Wagon. I think this is a symbol of what happened to the movie. It left behind the cool, the excitement, in favor of story and dialogue, but it just didn't work.And it's not just that I hate dialogue-heavy movies. 12 Angry Men was all dialogue, and that's one of the best films ever made, I think. But I'm expecting something different from Tarantino.Don't watch this. People tried to warn me but I saw it anyway. Don't watch this.",5,9,15,8 August 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Best war movie ever made
","This is definitely the best war movie ever made. It starts out like every movie should, on the shores of Normandy Beach, with blood spraying and body parts flying and explosions and gunfire and everything.Then the dust settles, and out of it emerge the soldiers that will become almost your buddies, if not your companions, throughout the movie.That is why it is shocking, after all these characters reveal themselves and you know them so well, when almost all of them die.I'll be honest, I shed some tears at the end of this movie. You have got to be a robot with no tear ducts not to cry.This movie touched me like very few, if none, have, despite the fact I'm not even American-born. Great, great movie.",10,1,4,8 August 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," Love it, man! Don't read reviews, watch it.
","It's impossible to love this movie. Half of it seems like such a straight-up post-heist thriller, and then all of a sudden, bang! Vampires, man! I knew about the twist before, because of this wonderful spoiler-free world we live in (I complain, as I spoil the movie) but it still caught me off guard.It really captures the feeling that people get when something completely unexpected happens. After all the vampires came out, the rest of the movie seemed like just a dream. Nothing seemed real.Just a great, great movie in general. Robert Rodriguez, you are a genius.And then he did Spy Kids, ladies and gentlemen.",10,0,1,8 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas, Lucas, Lucas...
","What have you done, man? This guy is 3 in 3 right now. He's made Episodes IV - VI and those were BRILLIANT, and he's made I - III and those were poo.Granted, III smells the least but poo is poo no matter what kind of bucket you put it in, especially if the bucket wasn't really there because they actually green-screened it in.This movie is simply no good. Not exciting, not involving, the only redeeming factor is the CGE, but I go back to my earlier bucket comment.I remember myself saying to my parents, as we walked out of the theater, 'I'd rather have seen Episode IV again.' It's bad news if your most recent film just makes people want to go back to the days in which your movies didn't suck.",4,3,5,8 August 2008
