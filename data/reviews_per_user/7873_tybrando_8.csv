The Blair Witch Project," 'That's it?!?'
","This is a comment I overhead from a female audience member as the movie ended.  I must confess, I felt somewhat the same way. This movie has been 'hyped' so much, that it has almost become a 'don't miss' movie -- and the viewing I attended was nearly full.  Although the film did create interest, and build a certain amount of tension, it never-the-less at times had the feel of an episode from MTV's 'Real Life.'  I mean, a lot of it was about the interactional dynamics among the group members.  The supernatural, for me, was almost secondary.  The ending is somewhat creepy, but was also hard to follow . . . the cheap, home-movie feel became a bit tiresome after a while.  I told my daughter, on the way to the theater, 'There is no way this movie is going to live up to the expectation.' -- and, it didn't.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
American Beauty," Many layers of meaning . . .
","This is an excellent film, very honest and savvy -- depicting and dramatizing many of the issues and questions that besiege us in a society that grows increasingly more complex.  The narrator, Kevin Spacey, tells us of the questions and confusions that come along with adolescence . . . referring to his daughter he says, 'I wish I could tell her they will pass -- but they don't.'  Is this not a correct statement?  There is a WHOLE LOT woven into this tale . . . it is perhaps the best film of the year . . . very funny, entertaining and provocative.",9,0,0,3 October 1999
Meet Joe Black," The most amazing thing about 'Meet Joe Black' is . . .
","Claire Forlani!  The quality of her acting was eclipsed only by the quality of her beauty.  What an extraordinary face!  Kudos as well to Sir Anthony, who is perhaps incapable of a poor performance.  There were some touching moments to this film, and I found myself liking it better than the critics said I would. I can hardly wait to experience more of Ms. Forlani!!!",Null,0,0,26 November 1999
Pi," Very unique and interesting film
","I found this film extremely fascinating, thought-provoking, and well worth any serious movie-goer's time.  The soundtrack was excellent and a great fit for the mood and theme of the movie. I highly recommend it!",9,1,3,20 February 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A mixed bag . . .
","Not all is clear . . . but one thing's for sure -- Stanley loves Nicole's body.  In fact, perhaps a hour of going over her body with the lens . . . from all angles . . . would have made a better picture (at least for the guys in the audience).  What we got, was not too far removed from that.  I think this movie ran way too long. Not sure what the point was of having a child in the picture, except to demo how Tom has almost zero relationship with her.  Tom, as a doctor, kinda had a false ring to it . . . Some of the mood and imagery was interesting, and kinda 'artsy,' however, it did not seem to fully develop.  To paraphrase Garcia, 'What a long, strange   trip' this was.  Did I enjoy it?  Sorta.  Does it compare with his best work? No. My suggestion:  wait for the video.",5,1,2,18 July 1999
The Green Mile," Like a very good 'X-Files' episode
","Very much enjoyed this film . . . the magic of it, and the beauty of it. All the actors did a great job, and lots of wonderful scenes of Tom urinating!  :-)  The Gary Sinise part (defense atty. for Coffey)was perhaps unnecessary, although nice to see Tom and Gary together again!  It seems that something could have been done to pardon John (who, by the way, was WONDERFUL!!!).  Did they not have any scientific tests available back then to        rule-in/rule-out suspects? Isn't it obvious (in the 'real world') that just because someone is holding a dead victim, it doesn't necessarily mean he/she is the perpetrator?  I would liked to have seen more of the trial and had more information as to what efforts were taken to acquit John. Despite his wish to die, was not Hanks obligated to help John be free -- KNOWING he was truly not only an 'innocent,' but obviously a wonderful miracle-worker?!?  Same argument for the warden.  Wasn't the joy of seeing his wife healed enough for him to do everything within his power to see John freed?!?  But,then again, were these things pursued, it would have been a different movie.  Although the fact these things were not pursued frustrated me slightly, still, I very much enjoyed this film, and very much look forward to one day making it a part of my own personal film library.",8,0,0,26 December 1999
Tombstone," Not a motel . . .
","but a 'Best Western!'  This is one of the best westerns of all time.  It has great mustaches . . . great dialogue . . . great acting . . . great action .. . great colloquialisms . . . It is difficult to find any flaws in the this film.  Outstanding characterizations by Kurt, Val, Powers (when has there been a more likeable and appealing villain?!?!), Sam, Bill, and yes, Billy Bob . . . What a great film!!! (and, relatively speaking, historically accurate too!)",8,0,0,18 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," I don't 'get it' . . .
","What is the point?  The cinematography was excellent . . . and something ethereal about the ceaseless wading through the 'sea of grass' . . . I guess 'the point' is the whole 'War is hell' statement.  I don't know . . . after this movie I'm sick of war pictures and plan not to take in another one for a looong time. This was no 'Silence of the Lambs,' -- meaning:  a movie can be great, regardless of the subject matter, if the script and the acting and the sets are great.  'Silence' didn't 'do it' for me because it was about 'sickos,' etc.  No, it was because of Hopkins and Foster . . . that picture was 'art,' -- I suppose I was hoping for the same thing here.",6,0,1,6 July 1999
