Casablanca," Thank God this film was made when smoking was still socially acceptable
","I have usually been bored or disappointed with the so-called 'timeless classics' I have bothered to watch, but not with this one. It has its flaws, but for some reason it just works anyway. Some of the flaws are: Laszlo's character, which is so totally virtuous you just want to take out a gun and shoot him immediately (it was fine for the 40's, but I think we expect a bit more ambiguity in nice guys nowadays); the ridiculous final scene where we're expected to believe that Renault continues obeying Rick's instructions even though Rick has forgotten all about pointing his gun at him because he's too busy saying sweet nothings to Ilsa; and just generally I'm afraid the film is a bit sappy and full of cliches (and don't tell me this film invented the cliches, it didn't: they're as old as corny love stories, and those go back very far indeed). The reason it just works anyway is, I think, simply Bogart. No one ever incarnated so perfectly the man every man wishes he was and the man every woman wishes she could meet. And he smokes so beautifully... Bergman is great too, but her character isn't nearly as well developed.A word of advice: if you haven't seen the film before and you happen to get hold of the 'special edition' with 1/2 hour of 'making of' stuff before the feature, fast-forward to the film and watch it before watching the introductory material, because it is spoiler city.",9,0,0,14 July 2000
Se7en," Nice try
","(Some SPOILERS!) Here you get to see the most moronic individual ever to wear a detective's badge (well played by Brad Pitt, but it may come naturally to him) team up with the standard wise, fatherly old cop (Freeman) to trade cop talk lifted from some TV series for about an hour and a half. Interspersed with this insipid dialogue are (1) some gross scenes which are meant to be shocking; and (2) random scenes featuring Gwyneth Paltrow which have absolutely nothing to do with what passes for a plot up to that point, making it pretty clear that either (a) something's gonna happen to her in the end; (b) the script was written by a moron; or (c) both of the above. Nothing of any interest at all happens until Kevin Spacey finally shows up, but even he has trouble making anything out of this silly, predictable wanna-be thriller. While I'm at listing things, here are the top two most annoying things about this movie (apart from Brad Pitt's non-character): (1) almost every outdoor scene features pouring rain (how utterly noir!); (2) almost every indoor scene takes place in an apartment which for some inexplicable reason has no lights, or whose occupants use exclusively 5-watt lightbulbs (so noir, it hurts).",3,8,16,14 July 2000
The Patriot," If the Academy awarded a booby prize...
","Holy moly, what a terrible film! Sentimental, cliched, predictable, implausible, full of elaborately manufactured tear-wrenching moments (ho-hum), full of one-dimensional characters, and as if that wasn't enough, unbelievably irresponsible. The portrayal of the British as evil incarnate is ridiculous, but the portrayal of the Americans as good incarnate is something worse than ridiculous, especially when it comes to the issue of slavery. Folks, that's not quite the way it was. But apparently Americans aren't ready yet to face anything remotely resembling a truthful account of their own history. A film like this certainly isn't going to help. We're the good guys, they're the bad guys. It's that simple. Aimed at an audience with an IQ near the level of plant life.",1,13,28,22 July 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Definitely on my top 1000 list
","I hadn't seen this film until today and I never would have rented it if I hadn't seen that it was so high up on the top 250. It wouldn't have been a great loss. It's a pretty good movie, but a bit sappy for my taste. Gives you lots of warm feelings inside about persistence through adversity, hope, friendship and all that good stuff. If you're into that, it is very well put together and it features some good acting and a beautiful score. Oh, and -- this could be considered a SPOILER given that it's a prison movie -- the ending is so nice and so predictable and so cute and so corny, it just hurts. Art, it is not.",6,3,7,8 July 2000
