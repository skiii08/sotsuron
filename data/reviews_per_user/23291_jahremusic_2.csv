The Incredible Hulk," A pointless movie that can't figure out its own plot.
","This was an excruciating 'reboot' of Ang Lee's 'Hulk', which was a far superior movie in my opinion. Had I known that the writer of 'Inspector Gadget' and 'Last Action Hero' was responsible for this, I wouldn't have watched. This story really doesn't bother with the comic book Hulk, and mostly just takes from the TV show. The one nod to the comic book is the return of the Betty and General Ross characters (which could just as easily been lifted from the last movie, without referring to the comics at all). However, this Betty is pretty ineffectual as a character and the General is nothing more than a dimwitted antagonist. The General's brainless plan involves capturing the Hulk's alter ego, Bruce Banner, and returning him to the military for study. His reason is that Banner's blood is the result of the army's experiments to create a 'super soldier'. However, we find out in the first act that the army already has the serum for this super soldier and injects it into the Generals lackey, in order to better conquer the Hulk. So why are they trying to capture Banner then, instead of just shooting him in the head? Later, the General finds another doctor that's been helping Banner, and has a storehouse of his blood. So they have everything that they need and decide to just leave it in a lab with no more than one army official and a Royal British special ops grunt. This has got to be the stupidest general in the U.S. Army. I would love to see the report that he sends to his superiors in Washington after all of the unnecessary carnage that has occurred under his watch. These are just some of the major flaws with the poor writing and execution in this movie. A big laugh happens when the British Marine has a few scenes wearing U.S. Army officer attire, complete with U.S. badges and medals on his lapel. If you want to watch a really ambitious super hero film, complete with character study and depth, watch Ang Lee's version. If you want to watch a CGI demo reel that's not really better than Ang Lee's version, have fun with this one.",1,6,11,29 November 2011
Knowing," Why the phrase 'sh** just happens' is incompatible with astrophysics
","If you isolate the extremely vague phrase of 'sh** just happens' without any context, yeah, maybe you can figure a way into making it relate to astrophysics. In order to do that, you'd have to do some research in order to understand astrophysics enough to find a connection. If you haven't done that, then this a question that comes out of a lack of knowledge of the subject. That means that you've reached a conclusion without understanding.This is exactly the major problem with this movie, and the context that this comment probably comes from when Cage's Astrophysicist character utters it. The writer has absolutely no knowledge of science, the scientific method, what scientists and professors actually do or anything remotely related to the subject. Unfortunately, he then decided to sit down and write a movie that incorporated and depended on key characters that were supposed to represent, not only the scientific community, but scientists who were educated in a very specific subject. Oops.It's obvious that this writer wrote this movie doing absolutely no research into the subject that he tries to use in the movie and makes major assumptions about it. This says three major problems with this writer.First, he's extremely lazy and sloppy, as he will just make up anything off the top of his head to get the story to reach the conclusion that he wants. He doesn't care if any of the characters or ideas are properly represented or consistent - just as long as he gets to his ridiculous ending.Secondly, he assumes that his audience his equally lazy and stupid, otherwise he would have realized that anyone that studied science, even minutely, would find the premise and the characters to be completely ridiculous.Now this last flaw leads to this writers third problem - he's dirt stupid. He is so incredibly stupid that he doesn't even understand that he doesn't understand certain subjects - to the point that he completes and releases a story and characters based on information that he doesn't understand at all. He just assumes that he knows enough to write about the subject, and that he doesn't see the monumental issues in his own screenplay. These problems would've been caught in a junior college writing class. There's no way that he even bothered to have anyone look at it before releasing it to a studio. He's just dumb.So yeah, in the context of story, 'sh** just happens' is a monumentally stupid thing to say, by a character that is poorly written in a sloppy movie that doesn't realize it's own stupidity.",1,3,6,2 May 2011
