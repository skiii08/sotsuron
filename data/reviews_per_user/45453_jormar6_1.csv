Changeling," Clint and Jolie at their best.
","Wow! What a movie. Clint Eastwood has demonstrated his cinematic prowess in this amazing retelling of a relatively unknown event in Los Angeles during the 1920's. Growing up in L.A. I had never heard of what happened in this sad but true story of the disappearance of one young boy and his mother's (Jolie) plight to find out the truth. Angelina Jolie who I have never thought much of as an actress has proved herself worthy of acclaim in this role. This is more than just a adaptation of historical events, this is a picture into police corruption and cover ups in a time when the checks and balances system hadn't yet permeated the Los Angeles police dept. I spent two days after watching this movie researching the actual events and found it to be a very accurate depiction of actual events. Great movie, great cast, great directing, a winner through and through.",10,2,3,5 July 2009
