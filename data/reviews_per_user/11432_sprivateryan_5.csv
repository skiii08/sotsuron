The Rock," Rock House Jail!
","The Rock is the best jerry bruckheimer action thriller ever made. The action never stops in this movie. And the thing that I love most about the movie is that with ever bullet that comes out of a gun in this movie, there is always the sweet sound of 'The Rock' theme playing. The score is very powerful and lives up to the movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and would recommend it to anyone who really loves action.(9 out 10 stars)",9,1,1,23 June 2000
Saving Private Ryan," This is the greatest war movie ever made!
","I can't express how much I love this movie!!! Everything about this movie is good, the acting, the action, the plot, everything! The part of this movie that I love the most is the drama. This movie is so powerful I swear every time I watch it, it gets better and better. This movie should have won best picture. I recommend it with great honor. (10 out of 10 stars!)",10,0,0,21 June 2000
Mission: Impossible II," This mission was accomplished
","I loved this movie! John Woo has become one of the greatest action movie director's in America. When I first found out that John Woo was directing a sequel to the first Mission Impossible, (which I hated by the way), I knew that he would blow out the first one from it's spot in the old box office. And I was right. John Woo keep making those good and stylish movies! (9 out of 10 stars)",9,1,2,21 June 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's first is a hit.
","Quentin Tarantino has become one of the greatest directors ever to say 'action!'. This movie is just so good. In my personal opinion Reservoir Dogs is the best out of Tarantino's movies. It just has a great plot from a well written script, great characters, even the guns are great. I really love this movie and am glad that Tarantino dropped his job as a video store clerk to go become a great director. Thanks, man for making this good movie!(8 out of 10)",8,0,1,23 June 2000
Heat," Two Words: 'The Best'
","H E A T is one of the greatest movies ever made. You put two excellent actors together to face off in a movie with well direction from a very good director, and you get this movie. I swear that the three hours go by so quick ever time you watch it. Quoting from my good friend, Jerry, 'This movie cannot be explained as one genre. It has everything in it. Action, drama, suspense, romance, comedy, you name it.' What he means really is that this movie is one of a kind. I do not think any movie today can compare to how great this one is. All the acting is terrific, especially Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Michael Mann took down this score that made it in my top 5.(10 out of 10 stars)",Null,0,0,23 June 2000
