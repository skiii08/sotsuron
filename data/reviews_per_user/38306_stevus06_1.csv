Mission: Impossible III," Actually turned out to be an awesome movie
","Honestly, you could say the worst about Tom Cruise and I wouldn't care because this movie rocked. For all of those people in the forums saying how bad a movie this was, and how the real mission impossible was waaaaay different, WHO CARESS!! You're paying like 8 bucks!! If you think 8 bucks is a lot and think it wasn't worth spending on a movie, YOU Shouldn't HAVE BEEN THERE NI THE FIRST PLACE! Anyway back to the movie. Was it just me or was this movie the only one to not contain any profanity, despite one or two at the beginning? Think about that one.Secondly, this movie had constant action, front to back. No crappy side stories, no 5 minute love scenes, no Tom Cruise jumping up on a couch etc etc. All around solid action movie, ass kicking, explosions, gunfights, car chases, AWESOME!!! 24 MOVIE YOU BETTER DO THIS!! 9 stars out of ten because he didn't drop the dude out of the plane.If you watched this movie and hated it and call yourself a Mission Impossible fan then thats sad because you're pretty boring and unoriginal yourself.",9,1,3,22 June 2006
