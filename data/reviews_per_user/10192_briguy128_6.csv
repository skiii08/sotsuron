The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash!
","And smash he does. Let me first off say that anyone expecting intelligence, a sophisticated plot, and well-developed characters should look elsewhere, because The Incredible Hulk has none of those things. However, those hoping to see some exciting action, a touch of romance, and a lot of the big green guy tearing sh** up will find this very enjoyable. This is a pure matin√©e popcorn flick, the kind that Ang Lee's 2003 movie should have been but wan't. And in that respect, it is great! In terms of a hero movie, The Incredible Hulk probably isn't as satisfying as, say, Iron Man or Batman Begins, but it's up there. I for one am relieved to have finally seen a faithful adaptation of the Hulk. Let's face it, he's not that complex of a hero. He gets mad, he throws a tantrum, he smashes things. Your inner little boy will be grinning. Enjoy.",7,4,7,18 June 2008
The Little Mermaid," One of the best
","Here we are, 20 years after its original release, and The Little Mermaid remains one of the studio's best works. This was, hands down, the best film to come out of the Disney studio in the 1980s and is definitely in the top ten of all time. The Little Mermaid works on almost every level: aesthetically pleasing, wonderful pacing, perfectly cast, wonderful score, and terrific musical numbers. The only minor complaint that I have is the inconsistency with Ariel. The studio had several animators contribute to her character, depending on the sequence within the story, and it shows. At certain points throughout the feature, such as her first encounter with Eric on the beach and their carriage ride through town, she looks, well, different; she has smaller eyes, frizzier hair, and sharper features. This is, however, more than forgivable, given the superbness of the rest of the production. This movie is awesome in virtually every aspect and still tugs at the heartstrings, even having seen it many, many times. Wonderful entertainment.",9,0,0,20 March 2009
The Fountain," A good idea but poorly executed
","My expectations were high for this film, yet it felt like only half of a movie. It was very artistic, to say the least, but that to me is not enough. Just when the story kicks in and we finally figure out what's really going on, it ends. The only thing that really kept me going was the awesome performance by Hugh Jackman who, in my opinion, is proving himself one of the finest actors of our generation. (He's becoming the new Jonny Depp---he makes even the most mediocre film watchable.) I have to give some credit to writer/director Aronofsky as there are some visually gripping and emotionally raw moments. Oh, and the musical score is descent. Unfortunately, none of this comes close to matching the frenzied, psychotic brilliance of Requiem for A Dream. Overall, this was a letdown.",4,0,4,8 June 2007
August Rush," Terrible
","August Rush was utter garbage disguised as a heartwarming musical fairytale. I've generally liked Freddie Highmore in previous films, however he was completely unconvincing here as a musical prodigy (did anyone else wonder how he could play guitar just by beating the strings and neck?)and did nothing except flash cheesy smiles throughout the film. Everything else from the stupid and predictable plot, to the acting, to the nauseating script, to Robin Williams impersonating Bono was awful. The editing will give you a complete headache and the music will get on your nerves. Seriously people, avoid this film. It is that bad.",1,7,18,18 March 2008
The Lion King," The Beginning of the End
","I am simply amazed at how much positive response this emotional hodgepodge has received since its release back in the summer of 1994. As a young teenager back then, I saw it opening weekend on the big screen and remember thinking that it was a very visually engrossing film. In terms of capturing realistic movements and sweeping scenery, the animation in THE LION KING had easily surpassed any of its animated predecessors, and for that I found the movie fantastic. As an adult now, I realize just how superficial my initial attitude toward the film was. If there's one thing that today's overabundance of CGI has taught me, it's that there's more to a film than just 'looking good'. You need story, compelling characters, an original and well-defined conflict, and, especially in the case of animation, an artistic hand with which to draw. There's no denying that many talented artists were at work on THE LION KING, unfortunately too much effort was put forth in animation achievements and too little in developing a solid story and a clever script. Like many other IMDb users, there's no denying that this film was adapted from Shakespeare's HAMLET, just as Disney's 1988 film OLIVER AND COMPANY was adapted from Dickens' OLIVER TWIST. I wonder why Disney did not acknowledge its blatant robbery of subject matter. This is unfortunately just a minor detail in my dislike for THE LION KING. This was, in my opinion, the first in a series of many films that signaled the deterioration of Disney's traditional hand drawn animation department. No doubt about it, they were in a definite slump in the 1980's: THE FOX AND THE HOUND, THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, THE BLACK CAULDRON (ugh!), but with a fresh new crew in their animation department and a galvanizing reinvention of the formula for animated musicals in THE LITTLE MERMAID, it seemed that Disney had gotten back on its feet. Alas, THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN were merely Disney's Indian summer, for with THE LION KING came a completely new generation of animated films. With THE LION KING and its followers, viewers were bombarded with a predictable stories, numerous pop culture references, an obnoxious slew of celebrity voices, dated 90's pop songs, campy humor, and heaping spoonfuls of sugary melodrama. Don't get me wrong, many of Disney's previous efforts had many of the same deficits and only a handful of them would I consider near-perfect, but the animated flicks of old never attempted to sell out their audiences in the way that THE LION KING did. Yet somehow all of these flaws are what made THE LION KING the most successful animated film in Disney history. Call me old school, but I do not think that Walt would have approved of this. Since THE LION KING's release and the replacement of traditional animation with CGI, animation I feel has lost its art. I dare you to re-watch LADY AND THE TRAMP, BAMBI, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, or anything made pre-1960 and compare it to such 90's fares as THE LION KING. You will notice that the films today no longer resemble moving paintings as they once did and as was the original intention of animation. Still, my opinion of THE LION KING, as well as the rubbish that followed (POCAHONTAS THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, HERCULES...okay, MULAN was not bad up until its pop-music ending..THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE???!!!) seems to be the minority. None of these later Disney flicks were works of art, they were just another form of advertisement---predictable story with the feel-good moral of an ending, comic relief sidekicks, a pop song rolling during the end credits, etc. Yes, they all have very admirable morals (what makes a true hero???...it is important to embrace diversity...who's the real monster here???)but (gasp!!!) that's unnecessary political propaganda. Disney wasn't always that wholesome (Does anyone remember the Siamese Cat song from LADY AND THE TRAMP or 'What made the Red Man Red' from PETER PAN?) and, even when they did take America's sensitivity into consideration, it never overwhelmed the entire project. Oh well, censorship is a completely different subject that needs not be addressed in this review. The point that I'm trying to make is that somewhere along the road animation was no longer considered art but simply cheap entertainment guaranteed to make money. And when I hear praise for films like THE LION KING for merely manipulating the general population with special effects, melodramatic plot twists, pop songs, and cheesy one-liners (not to mention lame attempts at comedy via ninja-fighting), I think back to when an animated film was not just a movie, but an idea, a seed, a creative project, an event, and and art form, and I am saddened.",3,12,30,1 May 2007
Happy Feet," ...Ugh
","No, this probably wasn't the worst film of 2006, but I'm quite sure that it claims the prize for 'worst animated film' of the year. Of course, I still haven't seen BARNYARD or THE ANT BULLY. Granted, if I can say that FLUSHED AWAY and CARS were the two best cartoon films to hit theaters this year, that's saying something about the diminishing quality of animation these days. But I digress.There's no point in summarizing HAPPY FEET, as I'm sure you already know what's it's about. What you probably don't know, as most of the big time film critics haven't mentioned, is that this film is pretty boring and bland. Make no mistake, director George Miller wants his audience to know that he is more an artist than a filmmaker, and the first 15 minutes of HAPPY FEET will draw you in with some beautiful scenes and intriguing musical sequences. Unfortunately, the quality of pic loses momentum when it becomes evident that no real plot is being established. This film is just an endless string of characters, song-and-dance numbers, chase scenes, etc. While the computer animation is above average, there is much left to be desired in that there is virtually no variation in color, just different degrees of blacks and whites.I'm not really sure who the target audience of this film is, but I can safely say that it is not little children, as there were some intense and frightening scenes involving a leopard seal and two killer whales. It's important to note that the point of said scenes remains unclear, as they were simply temporary conflicts with no real purpose to the 'story'. I'm also unsure what the message of this film was. There were blatant racial overtones as well as those concerning religion, conformity, and environmental conservation. Um, a little too much for a film about a tap-dancing penguin, don't you think? If you're looking for quality film-making, look elsewhere. If you're looking for mindless matin√©e entertainment, I also advise you to look elsewhere. However, if you're hoping to find an hour and forty minutes of visually and emotionally unstimulated and incoherent scenes involving lots of indistinguishable penguins, HAPPY FEET may be for you.",2,7,14,8 December 2006
