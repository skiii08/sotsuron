Resident Evil: Afterlife," A decent movie that ultimately falls flat
","Great Video Game based movies are hard to come by. There are those who fail instantly e.g. Street Fighter *cringe* , while there are also those who start well but ultimately fall flat e.g. Prince Of Persia. The Resident Evil Series is a curious case, as even though they aren't the perfect example of Good Video Game based movie, they have managed to do what many others fail to do. Be quite profitable.In Resident Evil Afterlife, Milla Jovovich returns as the powered up Alice (complete with clones), while Ali Larter returns as Claire Redfield with newcomer Wentworth Miller as brother Chris Redfield (pre massive bulk up of RE 5) as they face Resident Evil main protagonist Albert Wesker played by Shawn Roberts. Paul W.S. Anderson returns to helm the film.First to note is that despite the use of the Fusion Camera created by James Cameron and used in his film Avatar, the effects in Resident Evil Afterlife is not worth noting down . While it is far better than the 3D trash that is Clash Of The Titans, the effects does not change viewer experience.One of the main criticism in regards to the movie is the director himself. A self-proclaimed No.1 fan of major directors such as James Cameron and Ridley Scott, Anderson continually tries to imitate the styles of those directors. And it shows, Resident Evil Afterlife feels as if it is mix up between The Matrix with a pinch of Die Hard and The Terminator. He does not try to develop his own style and make RE unique as opposed to the other video game based movies. A perfect example of director putting his own style is Zac Snyder, a director who has this particular style that even as you watch his film, you instantly know it is directed from Zac Snyder. Even his use of slow-mo is unique as seen in 300.Anderson is also responsible for the, quite frankly, poor script, while some fans of the game might enjoy the many references to the game (Wesker's glowing eyes and the throwing of his sunglasses remind anyone of RE 5?) it is quite cringe worthy actually seeing it. The length of the film also makes it quite boring at times.Acting wise Milla Jovovich excels in her role as Alice, in contrast, Ali Larter and Wentworth Miller while decent, both fail to rise up. One of the major disappointments of the film is that it fails to go deeper into the relationship between the siblings Chris and Claire (one of the most interesting relationships in the games). As opposed to the games where their relationship is dealt deeply, the film differs, and it seems both Chris and Claire are siblings only because their last names are similar.Overall Resident Evil Afterlife will cater to the fans of the games, but for those who are looking for more will be disappointed. While not as awful as Resident Evil 2, it is a movie that isn't too spectacular and doesn't fulfill the potential that the series definitely has.",4,5,12,13 September 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A Good Start For A Film That Will End a Series
","I haven't felt a sadness like this since Star Wars Episode 3 and Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King came out, ending the much beloved Star Wars Franchise (movie-wise) and The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.With the first part of the last film of the Harry Potter Franchise, the end is indeed coming.In the Deathly Hallow Pt.1, Harry and his friends, leave the safety and comfort Of Hogwarts, to the dangers of the outside world, in order to destroy Horcruxes, items that contain the soul of the enemy Lord Voldermort.Visually, Director David Yates has been consistent (in his Harry Potter Movies) in his use of 'dark' tints, a trend first used in the Harry Potter films by Alfonso Cuaron, in order to 'signify' the change of tone from the childishness of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, to the darkness of Prisoner Of Azkaband. And a fair warning, this is not the same harry potter as HP 1. What differs, is Yate's uses of the hand held camera, or what I call the 'Jason-Bourne' camera. The result is some gritty scenes, that are quite enjoyable, especially when magic is casted.One Huge Difference Is the use of fantastic scenery, something that is a welcome change from the dull castle-like Hogwarts. One must congratulate JK Rowling for making Harry go out of Hogwarts in the books, the scenery is really breathtaking.Acting wise, the three main actors have done a commendable job, with Emma showcasing a side that is different from the usual seen in the past movies. The same can be said about Rupert Grint. I still have some problems with Daniel Radcliffe, while he is a decent actor, I do feel he lacks a good presence, and some lines do come out as awkward. This can also be due to his lack of experience.I do have some main gripes about the film.One of them, but this is probably due to the books, is the Huge Cast. With fantastic talent such as Helena Bonham Carter,Imelda Staunton, the always excellent Alan Rickman and the reliable Bill Nighy, they just don't get enough screen time, and when they do appear, it is usually for a few seconds. For example, Alan Rickman and Clemence Poesy only has a few minutes of screen time. This can also annoy some fans who have an affinity with some characters, i for one enjoy both Snape and Lupin, both are hardly in the movie.For Harry Potter Purists, some might recognise the cuts and modifications Yates has done in the movie. As a reader myself, the cuts of some scenes that I consider important gets really annoying (Whether scenes such as Snape's background and Dumbledoor's history are going to be shown in part 2 is left to be seen).Yates has also included some 'funny' moments, while some work, I feel some come out as awkward and just plain weird. Furthermore, the 'ending' of part 1, didn't come out well. While it makes many people painfully wait for next year, it does give a feeling that the movie is randomly cut there, the effect makes it feel 'complete' in a way.Overall Deathly Hallow part 1 is a good start for the last film of the harry potter film series. While it does have some annoyances, it does it's job of giving a sense of ending.",7,2,4,21 November 2010
