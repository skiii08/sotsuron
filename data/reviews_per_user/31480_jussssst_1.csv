Minority Report," NOT THAT GREAT AT ALL: Are «intentions» as worthy as «real actions» ?
","I don't think anybody came up with what I've written in the «Summary». Which is the gist of what «Minority Report» is about. Can one be judged by his intentions to commit a given crime, even if one does not actually commit such a crime ? Also, playing the «Time Machine» game would, in fact, be «useless» in the sense that TIME could then be run forward OR backward... In other words, all real actions could then be annulled and re-enacted... endlessly... again and again... Anyway... Am I one of the very few rare viewers who did NOT enjoy that film ? I hated the bluish all-invading tints (so very «COLD» and very unpleasant to look at!). Tom Cruise, whose profile is somewhat «birdlike», makes for a boyish, almost midget-like «hero» (notice his constant elevator shoes that hardly make up for his short 5 foot 7 stature). Although the special effects and the pictorial inventions are amazing (with obvious echoes of «A.I.»), it's just another action fare disguised as a futuristic, so called philosophical fable. As almost always with Spielberg's films (perhaps apart from «Schindler's List»), when I was viewing it, on the spur of the «action/moments», I got involved. But then, later when the dust fell down, so to speak, I realized that I had fallen for another spectacularly rather superficial tale (oh, yes!), with high-brow pretensions. Sorry folks, that's MY opinion. And I'm as entitled to it as you are to yours.",4,3,5,16 July 2007
