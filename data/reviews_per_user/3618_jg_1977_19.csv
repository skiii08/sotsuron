First Man," Visceral, Stunning, and Memorable
","First Man is an incredibly special film and an excellent viewing experience that I highly recommend, particularly if you can see it in IMAX. What's impressive about Damien Chazelle is that he has shown great aptitude at directing incredibly different types of movies. La La Land and First Man have markedly different tones and visuals, each to its own benefit, and it's a clear indication of Chazelle's capabilities. Unlike La La Land which was a portrayal of fulfilling dreams, First Man is a much more humble, grounded, and human story. It isn't about the triumph of successfully landing a man on the moon, it's a very personal story about the man who sacrificed a lot in his single-minded pursuit to make his daughter proud and serve his country. However, that isn't to say that they don't do justice for the story of the Apollo missions, they do, they just don't glamorize the missions and portray them as something they weren't. Chazelle shows us what the missions were surely like, overwhelming, heart-pounding, and harrowing. He uses sound design and gritty visuals in combination excellently to portray how easily the moon landing could have failed. The way he brings it to the screen is unbelievably visceral and completely thrilling, giving the audience a very unique experience compared to most other movies about space travel. In general, all of the technical aspects of this movie were terrific, especially the sound mixing/edit and cinematograpy. The moon landing sequence and following shots on the moon are absolutely gripping, and in IMAX, blew my mind. However First Man isn't just a well written, well directed, and technically stunning film, it's also expertly acted. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy both give it their all and add immense depth to each of their characters. Given that it could be a tight year at the Academy Awards, I hope that there's room for both Gosling and Foy in the best actor and best support actress categories, because they are certainly worthy of nomination. Over all, I strongly recommend seeing First Man on the biggest screen you can, it's an experience you won't forget!",8,0,1,17 October 2018
Hereditary," So much more than just horror
","Hereditary is hands down the most surprising, upsetting, and well-crafted movie I've seen this year. What makes this movie stand out is that it spends a lot more time than you'd expect setting the stage for a family drama to unfold before transitioning into a full on horror film. That makes you far more sympathetic to the characters and more invested in the final outcome than many other horror movies. Also, the storytelling in this movie needs to be applauded. The audience is never spoon fed answers about what is happening, but just given subtle clues one piece at a time, until the ending where you finally walk away with a complete picture. Also for people who are seeing this movie only for the horror element, it won't be what you are expecting but it also won't disappoint. The director exercised incredible restraint. When watching it you begin to think you sense a jump scare coming that any other movie would have, but instead, the scene fully plays out without one. What this does is build tension through the whole movie, making the ending that much more horrifying because the director finally lets loose. Lastly, I need to mention the acting in this film. Toni Colette and Alex Wolf in particular deliver powerhouse performances that elicit the full range of emotions. Hopefully once Oscar season rolls around, these two won't be forgotten, because their performances are truly worthy of nomination. Over all, if you are a horror fan, film enthusiast, or just want to see a good movie, Hereditary is the movie for you to see.",10,12,23,10 June 2018
A Star Is Born," A touching and entertaining film
","After seeing A Star Is Born, one thing is for certain, the names 'Lady Gaga' and 'Bradley Cooper' will be mentioned a few times at the 2019 Academy Awards. Although it's still early in the awards season, it seems quite likely that Cooper will snag a nomination for best director and best actor, both of which are well deserved. Whereas Lady Gaga is almost guaranteed to win for best original song and is a front runner for best actress. Those three categories, acting, directing, and original song, are where this movie really shines. The chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is undeniable and they both clearly pulled out all the stops, as every word they say and emotion they convey seems genuine. The directing however is what truly stood out to me, and considering this is Cooper's directorial debut it's all the more impressive. In particular, the concert scenes blew me away with how authentic and visceral they felt. As for the songs of the film, I would be absolutely shocked if one of them doesn't win an Oscar. They are not only moving and beautiful to listen to, but actually add layers to the storytelling and enhance Gaga and Cooper's performances. From what I've read, Gaga wrote and produced most of the songs, in addition to performing many of them in the film. All of these elements blend together masterfully to create an experience that is somehow both heartbreaking and feel-good, making it a true crowd-pleaser. However, the one place that I felt this film lacked was in the writing. Since this is a retelling of a classic tale, I wasn't expecting anything surprising in terms of the story beats, but I was a bit disappointed in some of the dialogue and especially the pacing. The first half of the movie takes place over the span of a few days, which does wonders for the character work of Cooper and Gaga, but then forces the rest of the story to be crammed into its second half. Although this is by no means a deal breaker for the movie, its pacing is noticeably off. Additionally, some of the dialogue seemed a bit clunky to me. Whether it was forcing in exposition, or just resorting to somewhat sappy lines, a lot of what I heard just hit the ear wrong. Despite those few gripes, I quite enjoyed this movie and will most certainly be listening to the soundtrack over the next few months. If you can, absolutely go see A Star Is Born!",8,4,8,12 October 2018
Us," A layered, crowd pleasing horror-thriller
","In Jordon Peele's Us, the writer/director gives one of the strongest follow-ups to a revered directorial debut in recent years. Although it will take at least one more viewing for me to fully solidify my thoughts on Us, it's safe to say that I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to getting to see it again. What stood out to me most after my first viewing is how talented a director Peele is; the man clearly knows how to make every frame pop and add layers to his intricately constructed world. Peele's use of reflections and color was the most impressive to me, although I'm sure more will become clear on subsequent viewings. In addition to Peele's talent behind the camera, the actors in front of it also bring their A-game. Not surprisingly Lupita N'yongo is doing tremendous work as both Adelaide and Red, but Winston Duke definitely stole the show as the quippy husband/father. In general, the entire cast is praiseworthy as they each are playing two characters, that move and talk completely differently from their counterpart. It speaks to how well-acted and cleverly-shot this movie is that at no point could I tell when it was the main actor on screen versus their body double. The only place where I can really take issue with this movie is with some elements of the screenplay. At points I felt like Peele was actually telling the audience too much, instead of letting them draw their own conclusions. Coming off of such a tightly-written screenplay with Get Out, the seams of the story in Us are a bit more noticeable, however, at the end of day, it's still a better written horror movie than most. Speaking of the moments of horror, from the beginning it's clear that Peele didn't want to make this movie be about the jump scares but rather about atmosphere and tension, and in my opinion I think he succeeded. Us isn't terrifying, but at no point did I feel like I was supposed to be feeling terror, just a building sense of unease and at times panic. In general, I strongly recommend seeing Us, especially in theaters, because this is a film meant to be seen with an audience. Jordan Peele has proved that Get Out was no fluke and he has met the incredibly high bar he set for himself.",9,2,4,30 March 2019
Ready Player One," Unfaithful adaptation, middle of the road Spielberg
","Ready Player One is movie that had an unfair amount of expectations riding on it. It's based on a beloved book and directed by one of the most celebrated living directors of all time. With that in mind, it's pretty understandable why most people were underwhelmed by it. Book fans were disappointed by the drastic departures it took from the original story. Spielberg fans felt like they were being pandered to with cheap nostalgial. That said, if you take away these lofty standards, it's a perfectly fine movie. Certainly nowhere near as impressive as some of Spielberg's other films, but I think it was his best work in the past 10 years. Visually, it's absolutely breathtaking with some of the best CGI you'll see. The characters are pretty one-dimensional but likeable nonetheless. The dialogue is mostly good, but there are a few lines that are either just clunkily inserted exposition or a loosely related popculture reference. In terms of story, it works perfectly fine but as I mentioned, it's significantly different from the book. However, almost all the changes I think were necessary to make it a more cinematically pleasing experience since half of the book is just descriptions of people playing videogames. If you're expecting a faithful adaptation of the book or the second coming of Spielberg, you'll most likely be disappointed, but if you can set that aside, it's an enjoyable film.",5,0,2,10 July 2018
BlacKkKlansman," And the Oscar goes to...
","BlacKkKlansman is an expertly made movie in every conceivable way. The acting, directing, writing, cinematography, editing, and music all mesh wonderfully to create one of my favorite movies of the year so far. I have been hearing about BlacKkKlansman all summer long as it came hot off the festival circuit, so my expectations were high, and boy did it live up to them. With the exception of a few on-the-nose lines, Spike Lee wrote and directed a movie that subtly and almost flawlessly drew stark comparisons with America today and the turmoil of the early 1970s. Detective Ron Stalworth is a torn man. Torn between helping to liberate and empower black Americans and uphold the law. How he manages to tow the line is by infiltrating and sabotaging the local KKK chapter. This movie is funny, poignant, and most of all horrifying. Like many movies that depict the race relations of the post-civil rights era, there are scenes and characters in this movie that will make your skin crawl and make you feel sick to your stomach. However, it's not without it's charm. Lee inserts just enough larger than life humor to keep you from becoming completely emotionally spent. The acting is also superb throughout, with every single major and minor character giving it their all. John David Washington was amazing as the lead, but Topher Grace and Adam Driver stole the show for me. I hope all three of these actors are in the conversation come Oscar season. Speaking of awards, I will be truly amazed if BlacKkKlansman doesn't just clean up next year at the Oscars. As I said, I thought every piece of this movie was well executed, but I in particular will be upset if it doesn't get nominations for directing, adapted screenplay, and of course best picture. This movie is not only wildly entertaining but also gravely important. I hope every person in America sees this movie because its message needs to be shared.",9,12,22,13 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," 'I can't stand the in-between parts'
","'I can't stand the in-between parts' (paraphrased quote) is at one point said by Freddie Mercury during this film while talking about the parts of his life between performances, which on a meta-level, was also my biggest problem with the movie. Although Bohemian Rhapsody is a well-acted movie with some amazingly staged performance sequences, the story that fills the remainder of the movie could be told better. Ironically, despite having notable director issues (Bryan Singer leaving the project a few weeks before shooting ended), I thought the directing was far from the biggest issue, and rather that the script was what brought the movie down. Anthony McCarten's screenplay seems to have flipped the age old saying 'show don't tell,' with much of the character development and important moments being described to the audience rather than shown. Considering that the general story hits quite a few familiar beats to other band/musician biopics, this lack of visual storytelling is a major detriment to the overall film. My other big issue with the story is that this movie seems like an odd mash-up of two movies. One, a dramatic and personal story about Freddie Mercury. The other an entertaining popcorn movie about how Queen came together and became what they are remembered for. In my opinion they should have chosen one of these avenues and explored it fully rather than trying to do both, as neither story arc gets the development it needs, and the final product is oddly disjointed. Despite these script issues, Bohemian Rhapsody does have some spectacular elements. Obviously the big one is Rami Malek's career-changing performance as Freddie Mercury. He not only nails the mannerisms and personality of Mercury, but also does a wonderful job at conveying the tortured soul hidden underneath the legendary performer. All of the praise that Malek has received is absolutely earned, as is his tentative Oscar nomination. Besides Malek at the center, the supporting cast does a great job as well, delivering either a dramatic performance (Gwilym Lee and Lucy Boynton in particular), or providing some needed levity and comic-relief. However, Bohemian Rhapsody isn't just well acted, from a technical-standpoint it also very well made, especially the concert scenes. The sound-mixing and camera work during the Live Aid scene is truly next level, and sets a new bar for showcasing musical performances in film. To sum up, Bohemian Rhapsody has all of the elements to be a great movie but just isn't able to balance the style and substance well enough for my taste. That being said, I think many people will thoroughly enjoy it, and any fan of Queen should see it for Malek's performance alone.",6,3,6,4 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," No, it's not over-hyped, it is that good.
","Wow. That's the only word that I was able to articulate after being blown away by Spider-Verse. Normally I write my reviews as soon after seeing the movie as possible, however this time, I needed to give myself a few days to make sure I wasn't just riding the high that the movie leaves you on, and that it actually was as well-made as I thought. A few days later and my thoughts haven't changed. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not only the best animated movie of the year, it's also the best superhero movie of the year (and this is coming from someone who loved both Black Panther and Infinity War), and simply one of the best movies of the year period (not to mention the best Spider Man movie of all time). This film succeeds in every conceivable way: it's got well-written, compelling characters that are brought to life by superlative acting; the visuals are stunning and create the most immersive theater experience of the year; the action is thrilling and never gets repetitive; the story manages to be both completely groundbreaking while also paying homage to the Spider Man story we know and love; and best of all, the comedy is absolutely spot on, every single joke lands without feeling cheap or getting old. As good as this movie is across the board, I suspect it all stemmed from an impressively written screenplay. Not surprisingly, Phil Lord (and an uncredited Chris Miller), truly understands what people enjoy and relate to in the Spider Man story and brings that to the screen beautifully. What's accessible about the character of Spider Man is that he (or she) is just a normal kid who gets these extraordinary powers and learns to become a superhero. As great a character as Iron Man is, it's pretty hard for a child to relate to the hard-drinking billionaire who happens to fight crime. Spider Man is relatable because he is a superhero every person can see themselves becoming in those circumstances. And that is the thesis of this film. Anyone can be Spider Man. The introduction of the Spider-Verse actually serves this message and enhances the story, which is what made the movie so enjoyable. At no point did the multi-verse concept feel like a device for selling toys (ahem... Porgs), but instead was a natural way to set up Miles Morales. There are only two things I could think of that could get criticized in Spider-Verse, the first is its inaccessibility to people who don't like Spider Man or superheroes, and the second is its visual style might not work for everyone. To address the first issue, I suspect there will be people who think this movie is only entertaining for people who already enjoy Spider Man properties, but I strongly disagree. Taking the Spider Man aspect out of this film, there's still a lot of great storytelling at work. Within this movie is a coming of age story about a black-hispanic kid trying to fit into his almost all-white high school, a story about a father trying to relate to his son, a story about a man who has given up on life who needs someone younger and more hopeful to show him the way, and a damn good science fiction story about a multi-verse. All of these narratives work without the superhero aspect, and I think make this film completely accessible to someone who has never seen a Spider Man movie before. The second issue about the visual style I understand a bit more, as initially the visuals didn't work for me. The style is shaky and imperfect and I felt like I was watching a 3-D movie without glasses. However, I realized they meant for the look to be imperfect and rough around the edges, just like worn out comic book come to life. I think part of the problem is that in recent years, with Pixar and Illumination movies, animation has gotten so refined and smooth, that is was at first off putting to see something break out of that mold. But after about 30 minutes, my eyes adjusted and I was able to get absorbed into the world they created. In summary, Spider-Verse is a mesmerizing movie that is firing on all cylinders and absolutely succeeds. It's funny, smart, heartfelt, with a message that makes me feel as hopeful and optimistic as I did when I was a kid seeing Toby Maguire become Spider Man for the first time. If you love Spider Man, you will 100% eat this movie up, and if you don't already love the wall-crawling hero, you will by the end of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Go see this movie!",10,9,18,17 December 2018
The Favourite," Best Lanthimos film to date
","As a big fan of Yorgos Lanthimos' previous two English-language films, The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), I was quite ready to dive back into another one of his unsettling and darkly comedic movies, and I'm happy to say, The Favourite (2018) did not disappoint. Although I'm guessing it will take a second and third viewing to be able to fully appreciate The Favourite, I think it's safe to say, that it is Lanthimos' best made film to date. From a purely technical standpoint, The Favourite outdoes the previously mentioned films thanks to its painstakingly detailed set and costume designs, unnerving score, clever editing, and stunning cinematography. However, what makes it the best of Lanthimos' filmography is the writing (thanks to screenwriters Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara), acting (specifically, the main trio of actresses), and Lanthimos' own bizarre directing. Although Lanthimos' credit to this film can't be understated, the screenplay, penned by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, is what sets it apart from The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Unlike Lanthimos' other films, The Favourite isn't nearly as avant-garde nor detached in its story telling. The audience is able to connect to the characters, who are all allowed depth and complexity, and each are given understandable arcs. It helps that this time around, Lanthimos really let his actors act, whereas with his other works, the characters deliver each line completely deadpan, heightening the detachment from reality. Speaking of the acting, this might be the strongest part of the entire film. Olivia Colman offers the performance of her career, making the Queen Anne tragic, hilarious, and endearing. Meanwhile, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz prove once more why they are both hard-hitting actresses, playing off of each other masterfully. As mentioned, it is Lanthimos unique directorial style, how he uses each element in combination, that makes The Favourite so special. In particular, Lanthimos' use of the camera and lighting is spectacular. The Favourite is a darkly comedic, at times unsettling, and smartly crafted film, worthy of being seen on the big screen. Lanthimos has raised the bar for his films, and I absolutely can't wait to see what he does next.",9,3,7,24 December 2018
It Follows," Good but could be better
","It Follows is one of the many examples of modern horror movies that serves as an allegory for a contempory social issue, and at that, it does quite a good job. Where it falls off for me is in the execution of some of the scares and character choices. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about this movie. I particularly was intruiged by the premise of a 'sexually transmitted demon' as well as how the demon can disguise itself. There are some amazing scenes of tension in which we see a person in the distance slowly approaching the main characters. Also the idea that the demon can disguise itself as anyone and be anywhere is truly terrifying if used in the proper setting such as a crowded area. However, the director/writer opted for the demon to be incredibly conspicuous for almost every scene where it would appear as a creepy old woman or demonic looking child. It seems like the director might have had pressure to make the movie more appealing to the mainstream audience so he had to water down his premise. I also took issue with some of the choices the characters make. We're told that the group of teens are very smart but then see them sit in an open field with their backs exposed to the demon. I personally feel like this was simply lazy writing to set up a scare. This makes it hard to root for the main character because at every turn, she does the least logical option often resulting in her getting nearly attacked by the demon. Overall, this movie is good, but I just think some elements of it could be done better. That being said, it's worth checking out for fans of the genre.",7,0,0,31 July 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," One hell of a first part
","Let me start by saying that I am an avid MCU fan and have seen all the previous entries, however I can acknowledge when the franchise goes wrong (the sequels to Iron Man, Thor, and Avengers comes to mind). Infinity War did an utterly incredible job of tying together 10 years of storytelling. For what this movie was meant to be, I don't think they could have changed a thing to make it any better (save a few lines that didn't land or jokes that ran a bit too long). The acting and dialogue is on par with the past few movies, with good performances all around, but some really stand out ones from Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, and of course Josh Brolin. The action is great, there's good close cut hand to hand scenes that the Russos are famous for and more impressive sprawling epic battle scenes as well. The CGI is mostly good, especially on Thanos and the alien planets, however a few of the children of Thanos did look like 4 year old video game characters to me. The biggest criticism I've heard of this movie is that it's inaccessible to non-MCU fans, which I think is perfectly valid. If you've only seen a scattered few of the movies, you could very likely get lost as they don't spend time re-introducing characters and previous plot lines. I will say however, that at this point, 19 movies in, you should probably have developed an opinion on the MCU by now. Those who thoroughly enjoy the stories and characters will be caught up and this movie will blow them away. For people who are more casual fans who just go for the action and jokes and aren't wrapped up in the overarching plots and character arcs, Infinity War can still deliver exactly what they want. Lastly, for people who just flat out dislike the franchise, this movie won't change their mind. It's more of what we've gotten in the previous 18 entries but on a more epic scale. As a hard-core fan, this movie had me wanting to jump out of my seat and cheer at some moments, and cry at others. Infinity War is truly the reward fans of the franchise are getting after 10 years. I will say however, that it is hard to rank it compared to the rest of the MCU. Since this movie ends on such a large cliff hanger that must be resolved in the follow up, it's very hard to look at it as a complete story. My guess is that people will lump Infinity War and Avengers 4 together as one large movie, much like people do with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2. If the follow up sticks the landing and completes this story in a compelling way, then this movie would probably land in my top 5 just above the first Avengers, but conversely it could get dragged down if the sequel doesn't hold up. I cannot wait to see how this story is wrapped up next year, and strongly encourage fans of the franchise to check this one out in theaters. If you haven't yet discovered the joys of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, certainly don't start with this one, but make sure you come back to it 18 movies later. It's worth the wait.",9,1,2,1 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Best Star Wars since ESB
","Let me start off by saying that I am one of the countless people for whom Star Wars was their childhood. ESB wins by a landslide as my favorite movie ever. After the most recent reboot, this movie was truly going to be make or break for me. If it took a page from TFA and just gave us a slightly more modern telling of ESB I would have lost faith in the franchise. I would have lost faith that they actually care about the fan base and want to make movies for us and not just to line their pockets. However, this movie truly struck a chord. Was it a perfect movie? Of course not. Did it do something incredibly brave and original that not only hasn't been done in Star Wars, but in cinema in general? Absolutely. This movie has everything, the epic space battles, incredibly choreographed fighting, quotable lines, and scenes that make you want to stand and cheer. Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan this movie will have something that appeals to you. And if you are a Star Wars fan then I think you're in for quite a treat. Now, to address the people giving this 1/10 for some inane reason. I keep hearing things like 'This was out of character for Luke' and 'It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie.' To address the first complaint, all I have to say is, it's called character development, look it up. To address the latter, I say be more open-minded. No this isn't a movie that fits perfectly into the confines of what the previous films have created. But that's a good thing. What Star Wars is at its core, is a risky movie that challenges the norms. 30 years ago when ANH came out, nothing like that had been done. It rewrote what it means to be a good film. Some years later, ESB challenged what we thought a sequel could be. And now, TLJ yet again takes Star Wars to a bold and interesting place. Because of that, it is the truest Star Wars we have gotten in almost thirty years and holds up to the originals. If you don't go see this movie, as a fan or non-fan alike, you are greatly missing out.",8,15,37,16 December 2017
The Descent," What a wasted concept...
","This movie had potential to be great. I thought the premise was very intruiging: a group of women get lost while spelunking and come to discover they're being hunted by humanoid monsters. The problem is the director/writer had no idea how to create tension so the most important aspect of this movie, the horror, is left up to jump scares, and not effective ones at that. Not surprisingly, the creatures don't even show up until the halfway point, because the creator clearly couldn't come up with more than 40 minutes of being hunted by monsters. As it is, it gets repetitive after 5 minutes. On top of that, it has the most unlikeable protagonist, Sarah, I've seen in quite awhile. Her character is subject to the worst of horror movie cliches, by making idiotic decisions no real person would make, all for the sake of setting up an obvious scare. What's even more suprising, is that the secondary character, Juno, was far more interesting, and was by far the stand out of the movie. If you want to see a good psychological thriller about a group of women exploring the unknown, go watch Annihilation. If you want to see a tense horror movie about blind creatures that hunt by sound, go see A Quiet Place. Either of those movies has far more to offer in terms of unsettling horror, well executed jump scares when logical, and superior characters with understandable motivations. Stay clear of this movie!",5,0,4,23 June 2018
The Witch," Another A24 hit
","A24 is fast becoming my go to studio for intruiging, and often under-rated horror movies, and The Witch fits the bill. This movie was really quite impressive in it's realism to the time it was set, so much so, you could honestly believe this story did happen. The characters were expertly portrayed, and all tragic but fascinating, so you actually are invested in what happens to them. The scares in this film are sparse but well-earned. Eggers spends most of this movie building tension so that the few scenes in which he wishes to terrify, he succeeds exceptionally. I went into this with high expectations and was not disappointed. The Witch is a dense, complex, and deeply unsettling movie, but because of that, it is truly brilliant.",8,1,3,9 August 2018
Joker," A mildly entertaining movie that fails as a character study and social commentary
","Right off the bat, Joaquin Phoenix was quite good in this movie. Other aspects like the cinematography and production design were also very well done. Because of those aspects, I'm giving it 5 stars and not fewer. Sadly, the script just did not live up to the standards the rest of the movie set. My issues are that the screenplay lacks consistency in its depiction of reality, shoehorns in a Thomas Wayne subplot that's included just to make it clear this is a Batman (adjacent) movie, distracts from its own story with on-the-nose references to better films, and worst of all, fails to live up to its aspirations of having a point. The Gotham city that is depicted is wildly uneven throughout this movie, which is a shame because the recreation of grungy 80s New York was very impressive. At times we are meant to believe that this movie could take place in our world, with our grounded sense of reality. At other times it feels like it belongs to Zach Snyder's vision of the DC universe. This mostly comes across due to the characters (or caricatures) that Arthur interacts with. Essentially every single supporting player in this film is completely devoid of any humanity such as motivation or logic, and simply exists as a plot device to hammer home the point that people treat Arthur badly. From the hooligans that rob him (for a sign??) to the cartoonishly villainous Thomas Wayne, Arthur is constantly beaten down by characters who feel like they came straight off a comic book page, into a movie that aims to be as grounded and realistic as it can be. Speaking of Thomas Wayne, the subplot that involves him in Arthur's story is essentially only included to let audiences know that Batman exists in this universe. Yippie. Other than that, it does nothing to further develop Arthur's character (someone should really teach Todd Phillips what character study means). Then there's the Scorsese of it all. Major plot elements, characterizations, and visuals from this movie all significantly borrow from early films by Scorsese like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy (two exceptionally better movies). It got to the point while watching this movie that these on-the-nose 'homages' pulled me out of the viewing experience and made me think about how much more I'd rather be watching a Scorsese film than this one. Finally, and most egregious of all, this story completely fails to connect its characters and plot to a larger theme or message. It pays lip-service to several possible messages, all of them remain completely unconnected however, leaving an incoherent mess as the only take away. Although this isn't necessarily a criticism of the movie, it is quite aggravating that any reasonable gripe you may have can be defended by some dude-bro by the fact that this film has an unreliable narrator, thus rendering anything that seems broadly drawn or confusing a result of being told an exaggerated story. A better film would have used this to its advantage by immersing the audience more fully into Arthur's subjective mindset, however, the filmmaking keeps the audience squarely in the position of objectively viewing this reality. I'll admit I was never bored while watching the movie, so by that metric I think it's fair to say it's entertaining. However, the more I think about it, the less I like it, which is a massive failing for a movie that strives to be pondered and debated. My guess is that the people rating it 9s and 10s were probably going to give it that high of marks regardless of what happened on screen so take their word with a grain of salt.",6,8,22,21 October 2019
Parasite," The masterpiece of cinema 2019 desperately needed
","There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own.",10,22,36,17 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A stunningly crafted Nazi farce with a simple, yet powerful message
","The only fair way to judge a movie is by how well it lives up to own its aspirations, and in the case of Jojo Rabbit, it is a stellar success. Writer/director Taika Waititi tells the coming of age story of 10-year-old German boy, Johannes (Jojo), who is being brought up in the Hitler Youth during the final months of the second world war. When Jojo learns that his mother is harboring a jewish girl in their attic, he must confront his ideals and face the truth that Nazis are nothing, if not absurd. The manner in which Waititi handles the absurdity of the Nazis, both with his writing and his portrayal of an imaginary Adolf Hitler, is pure comedic genius. His approach works because he creates humor in both surface-level and subtle layers. As a comedy, completely divorced from its subject matter, Jojo Rabbit would still be riotously funny thanks to the physical comedy and all-star line deliveries from every cast member. And with the subtext of taking away power from Nazi propaganda and ideals, reducing them to cartoonish manifestations of a boys imagination, this film succeeds to an even greater degree. Jojo Rabbit never aspires to tell the harrowing truth of the Holocaust or to completely dismantle the Nazi ideology because from the perspective of a young boy learning to love rather than hate, those beats would be out of place. The film accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is prove that we can all change into a better person, simply by doing what we can. Although the comedy and heart of this film are the main attraction, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that from a purely technical and narrative perspective, Jojo Rabbit is equally fantastic. The film is gorgeously shot and edited, with some of the best visual storytelling I've seen this year. Waititi has thoroughly cemented himself as a contemporary master, and I can't wait to see where he goes from here. Jojo Rabbit is hilarious, heart-warming, and easily one of the best cinematic experiences of the year.",9,8,26,25 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Don't listen to the bad reviews
","Why there are so many poor reviews I don't know. This movie is exactly what it was advertised to be and in no way was just a remake. Yes there were similarities between this movie and particularly Ep IV but these are all intentional nods and references not lazy reuses. The most obvious 'reuse' is the fact that the First Order has a new planet destroying weapon that the Resistance must destroy. But the writers even found a new way for them to do this besides just an X-Wing flying in and blowing it up. Also, Kylo Ren's mask and speaking isn't a lazy re-imagined version of Vader. He himself worships Vader and is obsessed with being like him. This movie did a brilliant job of taking new actors with a new story (this is Star Wars for the new generation after all) and combined them with the original actors and clever references to the original trilogy. The dialogue was perfect for this movie (and very much in JJ Abrams' style) with just enough witty banter and clever one liners to keep you amused amidst all the serious action. And finally that brings me to the action. It wasn't over done, it was believable, and was perfectly reminiscent of the original trilogy. What the prequels did a bad job of was throwing in a bunch of action because they could leading to several unnecessary, over the top fight scenes that left you rolling your eyes. This movie is wonderfully devoid of those elements. It is its own wonderful movie but is still definitely Star Wars. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, any younger future fans, fans of a good action and adventure movie, or just anyone who wants to get the bad taste of the prequels out of their mouth. See it! You won't be disappointed.",7,8,50,3 January 2016
Annihilation," Probably the best scifi-horror movie of the past 10 years
","As it stands at the halfway point of 2018, this film is probably my 3rd favorite release so far. I liked quite a bit about this movie, I'll go through all the big items, piece by piece. First, the characters are all done wonderfully, especially given tha it has an ensemble cast. All the main actresses get a moment to shine and a deeper dimension besides their outward description, Portman and Thompson in particular turn in stellar performances. Second, it masterfully crafts tension and horror. From the very beginning we are on the edge of our seat, and the unease only builds until the last frame of the movie. Also the horror elements, are truly terrifying, with proper build up and no reliance on jump scares. Lastly, the visuals are some of the best I can think of. Every frame is gorgeous and could be a poster on your wall. My biggest issue with this movie is the ending, as I suspect is the case with most people. Throughout the movie, it's walking the line between science fiction and horror, and then the last 20 minutes turn hard into the science fiction aspect in a very unexpected way. Not to say that the ending is bad, but I felt that it was far too abstract with not enough set up for it to be earned. I suspect that writer/director Alex Garland intended to make this ending shocking and confusing, but I think he took it a touch too far, resulting in a climax that feels like it belongs in a different movie. Despite my gripe with the ending, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, so much so that I recently rewatched it. Everything about this movie is executed so well that I suspect Garland will be remembered as one of the great modern, scifi directors. My last note is just a piece of advice for those who do watch it at home. Watch it on the biggest, highest definition screen you have, with a solid sound system. A big part of this movie is built on it's visuals and sound design and you won't get the same experience if you watch it on a low def TV or laptop.",8,1,6,10 July 2018
