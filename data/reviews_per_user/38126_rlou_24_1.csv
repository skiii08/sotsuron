Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Killing the vampires
","Not a bad film, nothing amazing, but worth a watch. However, has anyone else realised that the guy Abe meets who trains him that turns out to be a vampire himself that goes around killing vampires, well the part of the film that shows how he was turned into a vampire clearly shows that he is unable to kill another vampire, but he is a vampire hunter!!!! Has anyone else realised this? Or have i missed something? Apart from that the film is good, the fighting scenes are a lot better than expected. Especially the horse scene. I was really impressed by that scene. The graphics also seem to be very good, especially when he is killing the vampires.",Null,0,0,19 October 2012
