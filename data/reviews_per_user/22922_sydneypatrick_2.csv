The Ring," As good as the first, but just.
","As scary movies go, it's not bad in spite of taking a very creepytheme - death by videotape - and making it PG-13 material.  Whichmakes me want to rant on WHY this one made a PG-13 rating inspite of its thematic content and yet a light romantic comedy likeKissing Jessica Stein received an RÂ…. but I'll abstain.
Comparatively, this version is more engrossing than the Japaneseoriginal (1997) and although it does flesh the original script out abit, it still fails to live up to its creepy theme - that a supernaturalpresence is killing people by having them watch a videotapedpicture puzzle riddle.  The Japanese version depended too heavilyon the metaphysical and internal struggle of its heroine (and herclairvoyant ex-husband) and as a result it doesn't pack much of anemotional punch.  The American version brings more of that innerturmoil to the surface and we are able to follow along as she tripsand stumbles and figures her way through this nightmare.The production values are all good, particularly with re: to thevideotape itself and the collective imagery it holds.  It's a well-shotmovie, and the DOP deserves kudos for a job well done. 
The performances are all fine, and the story is full of possibility, butthe delivery is lacking and could have been much better.  I blamethe director, Gore Verbinski, who has failed to live up to hispotential before (The Mexican, Mouse Hunt).  In what otherprofession can a man make millions by being mediocre? 
Naomi Watts deserves better material than this, as does theunder-used Jane Alexander, who makes an appearance here asan island doctor who may or may not have a clue to what's goingon.  I think, in greater hands, this might have been an excellent filmgoing experience.  As it is, I can recommend it on a matinee if youreally want to spend the money, or on rental if you are smarterthan, and have a greater depth of patience than, the averagePG-13 consumer.",6,0,0,20 October 2002
Blow," Unsympathetic Hero gives lead to good film.
","Ted Demme directs this morality tale of a truly unsympathetic heroand Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz have never been better. Everything about this one is good and solid, if only the poorschmuck at the center of this story would have chosen to make anhonest living instead of trying to take the so-called 'easy' way out. I mean, really, how poorly are we supposed to feel for the guy whointroduced cocaine to the American masses?A bit of miscasting with Rachel Griffiths and Ray Liotta as JohnnyDepp's parents.  As talented as these two are, I didn't buy them ashis folks.That aside, it's a good movie worth watching more than once, asit's very layered with many characters that parlay the decade ofdecadence, including a turn by Paul (PeeWee Herman) Reubensas a hair dresser cum drug dealer.  Too bad for that, too, as it's areminder of his hidden talents that will forever be locked away forvarious felonioius violations (at least they should be).For fans of Johnny Depp, this is a must see, but it is PeneloopeCruz who is absolutely riveting in her portrayal of his consumingwife with an insatiable appetite for party fortunes.",8,0,1,30 December 2002
