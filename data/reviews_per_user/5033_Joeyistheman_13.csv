Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'i like you'
",WOW! Sacha baron Cohen really is a genius.a lot of comedy film makers are really going to have to work really really hard to make a film as funny as this it had me crying with laughter.Ali g in DA house was awful to watch and Bruno is just too vulgar but this is just right it is a little racist and it is very offensive in a lot of ways but will still have you talking about it for the next few weeks after seeing it.hopefully he will make more movies like this but no-one really knows i do think he crossed the line on a few jokes but I'm really surprised he is still alive seriously he very nearly gets killed in this movies give it a go you will see what i mean.,7,0,0,8 May 2011
Sucker Punch," 'sucker punch'd'
","After watching sucker punch,i can now say the i am very disappointed in Zack Snyder he 'was' a brilliant director with great potential but sucker punch drives his down the road to disappointment and failure,it could have been so much better but the storyline was not explained enough and it was also all over the place jumping back and forth,the action scenes are pitiful,that just jump out unexpectedly (but not in a good way) and are very far fetched,i know it is a action,fantasy movie but really 5 girls can take on an entire German army using only a couple of bullets and a sword.the title of the movie is catchy but i dose not make any sense if any of these girls sucker punched anyone they would break a nail.it's not epic,it's not mind blowing its just cheese on toast.1 star for Zack Snyder 2 stars for the blonde 3/10",Null,1,3,19 August 2011
Oldboy," Brilliant revenge drama.
",I never really liked Asian movies until i saw this one a few years ago but since then i have been interested in seeing all Asian movies that hit the market because they really do know how do make some good movies. the reason i never liked foreign movies was because of reading the subtitles but need not worry about this one 15 minuets into the movie and you wont even notice that you are still reading them. I have mentioned this movie to a few mates and they all say that they have never heard of it.it has become a known fact that this movie is not very well known...which is a shame because it is a brilliant revenge drama. some very interesting scenes in there too for example i have never seen an actor eat a live squid before.the storyline is amazing too. give this little Asian gem a chance you will not be disappointed.,10,1,4,19 May 2011
American Beauty," Pure beauty
","Let me start off by stating that this is my favourite movie of all time. the storyline follows lester burn ham a middle-aged man whose life has taken a downfall in the last few years and is fed up with the way his life is...and he decides to change it.Also can i state that the cover art of this movie makes it look almost like a chick-flick so (to the men) don't be put off by it because it is not a chick-flick.Kevin spacey gives an incredible performance as always,the power between Kevin spaceys and Annette bennings acting is truly on of the best I've ever seen,i also have to say that Sam mendes is a genius at directing this movie the use of making everything behind closed doors look so perfect is amazing....but it turns out its not so perfect at all.Alan ball also did a really good job at writing the script too.although this movie is not for everyone as a few people hate this movie,but someone always has something to complain about. I NEVER get tired of watching this movie and i don't think i ever will.10/10LOOK CLOSER!",10,1,2,12 May 2011
Face_Off," Mind-blowing
","Face/off is a mind-blowing,action packed,fast paced,masterpiece. the plot is truly amazing it is like nothing i have ever seen before. Nicolas cage and john travolta are two of the best actors to have picked for this movie,the movie is very original and violent (but in a good way) Nicolas cage plays a great maniac,i would have preferred to have seen the identity switch the other way around,but it works the way it is.this movie is an instant classic.it is directed by john woo which means the movie would be amazing even if the two worst actors in the world were picked for the role's of caster troy and Sean archer. don't miss this unforgettable action movie. 10/10",10,1,1,12 August 2011
The Exorcist," The mother of all horror movies.
","People ask the question 'is the exorcist the scariest movie of all time' and the answer is yes,it certainly is very,very scary. I have wanted to see this movie for a really long time but i was not brave enough to sit through it,my friends and family have warned me to never watch it,but i have a weakness for scary movie's,so i sat down to watch it,and i can finally say this is the scariest movie of all time. when it got to about 1hr 15 Min's i had to turn it off, one scene in particular (the crucifix scene) sent shivers running down my spine. I have watched approximately 2000 horror movies and this is by far the scariest.the lead actress (linda Blair) deserved an Oscar for her performance as she was so young at the time of the films release. APPROACH WITH EXTREME CAUTION. this movie is very,very SCARY.the scenes to watch out for-those who have seen the movie will know. 'the sow is mine scene' the crucifix scene the spider-walk sceneenjoy 10/10",10,2,4,25 May 2011
The Number 23," Jim carrey can act.
","Through Jim carrey's career we have seen him in numerous roles where he just act's like a complete idiot pulling the same ridiculous face and the same impressions(i do not class this a acting),however i do like Jim carrey's older movies but i was interested to give this a viewing as i was shock that it was not a comedy,it was a phsycological thriller and so i thought 'finnaly a serious role' for Jim carrey,anyway i found this movie very interesting and it kept me hooked to the storyline and kept me guessing right till the shocking ending,the performance that he give's is living proof that Jim carrey CAN act. Do not be put off of this movie by the IMDb rating 6.2/10 which is an outrage as anyone who doesen't see this movie is going too miss out. my rating 8/10 'The Truth Will Find You'",8,1,2,20 May 2011
The Mist," Stephen king does it again.
","The master of horror Stephen king has created the ultimate monster movie.this is one of his better movies as a few of them have the same story lines.this is far better than the recent monster movies we have seen in the past few years.hopefully Stephen will make more movies as good as this one and i hope there will be a sequel in the coming future.there is some great casting,brilliant acting and a superb ending that will leave you breathless and begging for more. this may be a horror/thriller movie but i will say that i did shed a tear or two at the shocking but impressive ending. my rating is 8/10. Well done Mr.king",8,1,3,15 April 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," 100 times better than inception
","I read many reviews on this movie before viewing it some were good, and some were not so good,most reviews were calling it 'the Bourne identity meets inception' well to me that is utter lies,the adjustment bureau has a completely different storyline to inception and is 100 times better anyway.the movie is put out to be a 'romantic action movie' that is wrong in so many different ways,the first half of the movie is romance and the second half is on the edge of your seat suspense,the balance of the action and romance is just right.the problem with inception was they were trying to impress viewers with the special effects so that viewers would not notice how rubbish the movie was,need not worry with the adjustment bureau the special effects are not just splashed around everywhere just for the sake of it. forget about inception and watch this one instead. 10/10 excellent",10,1,3,5 August 2011
Avatar," over-hyped!!!
",This movie 'avatar' is possibly the best selling movie of all time.the plot is brilliant and it is well written but it was a disappointment.i thought it was just TERRIBLE the CGI is amazing but it is just not for me i guess. lots of people were telling me to watch it and after months of holding it off i decided to give it a go.but i just don't understand why so many people like this......I also feel that the movie dragged on a bit too long 'james cameron' was brilliant in making the classic titanic which is much better but i feel he has lost his touch since then it is a sci-fi Adventure type movie so if you like those kind of movies then go for it but if not then stay away from 'Avatar'.if you are a fan of james cameron the get a look at 'sanctum',2,5,10,8 April 2011
The Green Mile," 'what happens on the mile stays on the mile'
",This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. do not be put off of watching this movie because of its run time(3 hours) because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting and such a huge success. tom hanks is the main character but i think that Micheal Clarke Duncan really does steal the spotlight away from him. Stephen kings novel (with the same title) is not as good as the movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if you're a fan of tom hanks or Stephen king.i have never watched a movie that has made me cry but i have to say i was very close to tears after the undeniable ending.the script is just outstanding and the acting is spot on.the storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before and i don't think anyone will ever try to copy it.if you're thinking about viewing this title and you haven't seen it already i suggest you get the tissues ready.,10,13,17,6 May 2011
Inception," A little too confusing
","i will start off by saying that I'm not a fan of DiCaprio's work,but that is not the reason why i didn't like this movie.the special effects are spot on but i just didn't like the idea of the script, the acting was almost lazy and forced,it seems to me that maybe DiCaprio is getting worse with age (much like brad Pitt).of course when i viewed this with a few mates they all loved it but i was left with a headache.the script was all over the place and it was a little too confusing and hard to keep track of. this was named as one of the best movies of 2010 but i saw way better animated movie that year. do yourself a favour and save your money and time.",1,7,13,11 May 2011
The Fighter," sensational
","'the fighter' is a sensational look at the true story of Micky ward and his brother Dicky eklund,mark whalberg plays Micky a troubled boxer with great potential,Christian bale plays Dicky eklund,Micky's brother and also boxing mentor.i had to see this movie due to the great reviews it had but was a little put off because it was a boxing drama,i hate boxing movies rocky was the most overrated movie ever made,needles to say the fighter is the best boxing movie ever in my opinion.i definitely think it should get movie of 2011 but we all know the kings speech(which was poor) will win.i have read a couple of reviews stating that the fighter is a carbon copy of rocky,those reviews are wrong don't listen to the reviews that hate this movie it just mans that they are rocky fan-boys. the fighter 10/10 rocky 1/10",Null,0,1,11 August 2011
