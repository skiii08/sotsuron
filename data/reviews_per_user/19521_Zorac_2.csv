The Blair Witch Project," Jaws made America fear the ocean... Blair Witch, the woods.
","Every once in a while a movie will come along that will make America re-assess the way it looks at parts of life they encounter on an every day basis. For example, in the aftermath of such genius as the original 'Psycho' (1960), America lay witness to an actual recorded drop in the amount of women who took showers instead of baths. After a movie like 'Jaws' people were forced to think twice before entering the seemingly peaceful ocean. And now after viewing the shockingly original and very independent 'Blair Witch Project' (it had a $75,000 budget)and after seeing its opening weekend figures I am positive that this movie will make the country if not the world afraid to enter the woods at night. The acting is so good that it borders on genuine and the idea is so original and successful because it shies away from the horror-genre cliches that would usually appear in a movie that takes place in a wooded setting. Not only is 'The Blair Witch Project' one of the best summer movies ever, it is also scary enough to change the way horror movies are made in the future. God bless independent film.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
Trainspotting," wow
","Well folks, if this isn't one of the best damn movies ever made, I don't know what is. See Trainspotting, if not for the unbelievable directing, than for the unbelievably real plot. The acting is great the dialogue is head on. You'd be crazy not to see it.",10,0,0,18 January 1999
