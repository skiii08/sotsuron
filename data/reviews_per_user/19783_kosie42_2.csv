The Equalizer," basically a reboot of a classic, with bad-ass attitude
","I Went to watch the movie tonight. Most of my expectations were met. From the trailer of the movie it was clear the movie was out to exploit the theme of Man on Fire with the same actor... Off course the masses must be attracted to go watch the movie to make money, and not rather entertain the audience??!!This is not a classic Equalizer as we remember, rather a reboot of the original TV Series, a more R-rated bad-ass theme which basically do not justice to the original character.However, the little interaction between Denzil & Chloe is definitely stand-out scenes, funnily with way toned down violence. The theme of redemption rather than revenge do help the film. As well as a little pathos and empathy between the the 2 main characters hardly hurt the film. The movie is brutal, some might say realistic, but the normal expected action with gory violence and some cleverness infused from the main character. Action, thriller fans will like the movie, which might rather have been called another title.A Bad-ass reboot of a classic, yeah, but not for the intellectual. It could have been refined more, with the same storyline but with much more intellect to the viewers. Go watch it if you'd like to leave your senses at the door.",5,3,7,7 October 2014
Drive," superb drama interspersed with violence and suspense
","This is definitely on of my best movies of 2011. Realistically, believable drawn characters a suspensive and inquisitive insight into the human condition and its consequence of decisions. The main character can live next door to you at any rate. The absolute example of solitude and rigid principles.Gosling positively portray the dilemma of balancing moral issues with the deprived surrounding of circumstances. Grotesque and powerful moments are created with excellent visualization of each scene. Carey Mulligan could be your neighbour as well. Superb acting by all create the tension needed. Although the violence are extreme at times, it does explain the explosive and complicated nature of human beings. The driving action scene remind one of the exhilarating car chase scenes in 'Bullet'. well done and would satisfy action buffs as well.Last but, least the excellent music score underscore and almost 'narrates' the scenes. the film does have a 70's feel with relevant issues of today.Extremely well directed. a fine job by all, thought provoking with great music score. Well done. go see it.",8,1,4,17 December 2011
