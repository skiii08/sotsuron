Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible III
","I have never been this hard on a movie but in my eyes it deserves this. I came into this movie with a very high expectation for I have liked the other two. This movie didn't for fill ANY AT ALL of the expectations I was looking for. This movie was absolute garbage for many reasons.Tom Cruise......I couldn't feel his acting at all. It was dreadful. During many of the scenes I felt none of the emotion he was trying to set, and when he tried to act it was horrible and I didn't know when he tried to show emotion cause it was so horrible. The only good actor was Philip Seymour Hoffman.The special effects made me laugh hysterically. The explosions were horrible, the gun scenes, and many other parts were horrible. I tried to let my mind turn off and let me just watch them to try and make them look real but I just couldn't do it. The special effects were so lousy, I could tell every time when it was fake.The plot, so original. Let's see, guy takes prisoner/hostage, asks for item or they die. Oh where have we seen this before.....Like every other movie maybe? Except in other movies they're asking for money. A five year old could have written this plot.Now if you have half a mind and think during the movie you see many weird, confusing things. First of all, how does Ethan know EXACTLY where to go in each building like he's been there 50 thousand times? Many of the other scenes made no sense and were stupid but I won't say cause it's partly spoilers.Well that's my view on the movie, and how I found NOTHING good about this movie and it does not deserve to be watched more then one time.",2,1,2,8 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates 2
","Action, laughs, interesting, and a cliff hanger ending....What else does a movie need? Dead Mans Chest is the only movie of the summer so far that has delivered a good blockbuster.The plot is good but if you think about it, not one main plot......If you think about the plot it seems like each day the movie was filmed they made a new plot....one thing happens, then another random thing that makes sense happens, and something else happens and yeah. The plot was still great just....quite different.The jokes and action was pretty good. You got a few pretty hard laughs out of the movie and it happens at really good times. Also the fight scenes or the action scenes are pretty good and well choreographed.The special effects and costumes are amazing. Making people look like the coral, or like fish was awesomely done. The craken was a little weird looking at times and a bit disappointing at times. But still making the people look the way they did was amazing.Overall I loved this movie, the movie of the summer unless something else comes up. I would really recommend seeing this movie.",10,3,6,3 August 2006
Nacho Libre," Nacho Libre
","Nacho Libre Jack Black......a guitarist, singer, rocking out for the School Of Rock, and many other parts. Now.....he is a man of god....who happens to become a wrestler.Now just the way Jack Black tries to be a Mexican is great. His little Mexican accent is hilarious. At times you can't really understand what he's saying, but his actions and his words are great. The other people were very funny too, especially cave men midgets The story is funny as itself too. A man of god wants to become a wrestler to help the orphans of his church. But he needs a tag team parter, so he finds this guy who looks like a twig (who is also hilarious) and they fight together. They have no clue how to wrestler, so they get beat pretty much every time. There is also some random fat kid....who some how has a machete....Overall, the movie is really hilarious, and you should really go see it.",9,12,21,25 June 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine
","Okay, this movie has been reviewed by many people....Most people have loved it...Why? Because it is an amazing movie. You wouldn't think so, the trailer didn't really make me think about seeing this movie, but peoples words brought it out and has made more and more people watch it and more and more enjoying it.First of all.....This move was not full of clich√©s. For example when a guy was standing by a pool you were thinking 'don't push him in' and guess what, he didn't push him in. There's other times but I'm just using that for an example.The plot is simple. A little girl came second in a beauty pageant but the first place girl got disqualified so she becomes first. With that she is allowed to enter another beauty pageant called 'Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pagent' but the the family doesn't have enough money to fly so they have to drive to where it is. So on the way they run into many conflicts and they're all hilarious and great.This movie was original as well. Most of the jokes or what happens is new and isn't recycled from other movies. The directors and writers for this movie should be proud that what they've done isn't done much these days. To make a great movie that everyone will enjoy and it'll be rare for someone not to like it.The characters are interesting and each play a valuable role in the movie. You have the crack addicted grandpa, the gay uncle, the mute kid, the happy, optimistic girl, the work-a-holic dad and the mom. Now they use each of these characteristics well into the movie to give out they best jokes and the best situations they can get out of it. Each of the characters had pretty much an equal role in the movie. The way they did it was amazing.The ending.....just wow. I can bet anyone who watches this movie will not expect the ending to come the way it did. Another good thing about this movie, the unpredictability. When you think something will happen the complete opposite will happen. Simply amazing.Overall this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I would definitely recommend you to see this movie even if you think it looks good or not or if someone has said something bad about this movie.",10,1,4,4 September 2006
Saw III," Saw III
","The third movie in the 'Saw' series. We knew it was going to be made and the hype would be high for the movie. I came into this movie with very high expectations seeing how it was rated 'R' but then got dropped down to 18a. Since the rating dropped so did my expectations seeming it to be not as good and gory as I first presumed it to be. But I still expected a lot from it.First of all the plot was pretty nice and interesting. The subplot onto this movie made it better and more thoughtful. The way it was directed was pretty interesting and well done. But I have to say the 'games/traps' were pretty lame. Like in comparison to the last two, these traps were bad, and I was really disappointed in them.Saw movies, supposed to be filled with gore. The first one held its word, the second one, kind of, the third one, not at all. I was extremely disappointed in the amount of gore or blood was in this movie. There really wasn't that much, I don't see how it could have deserved the 'R' rating where I live. There was a bit of blood but nothing that made me go 'wow this is awesome'.Saw 1 and 2 started off quickly and kept me entertained. Did this one do that? No, not at all. I got extremely bored in this movie, there were large chunks that were boring, nothing happened. The only good parts were the beginning and the end.In conclusion I was horribly disappointed in this movie, and if I go see it again I will only go to see the beginning and the end, which is the only reason why I gave this movie a 7.",7,0,1,28 October 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men 3
","Mutants, explosions, fighting, action.......You like that? Go see X-Men 3. The movie entertains for the 2 hours like it's supposed to, but don't think about remembering what happened in the movie after you walk out the doors.First of all....The special effects were awesome, the people who did that did a great job, you'd feel like it's a good movie because they just wow you. Hopefully more movies get good special effects like that.The acting was pretty good I guess.....It is semi-famous people acting. At certain times you felt the emotion they were trying to feel, and at other times they didn't, I guess everyone can't be a good actor. I loved the Juggernaught The directing is basically the only down side of this movie. You see, nothing really happened in this movie...It was just cool special effect scenes. I forgot 99% of what happened in the movie because of how it was directed. They threw in some funny jokes too which was good.Overall, this was a COOL movie, not a GOOD movie a COOL movie if that makes any sense.",7,0,1,25 June 2006
Children of Men," children of men
","My expectations for this movie were pretty high, and out of the night, it was probably the movie I was most looking forward to. Disappointingly it didn't deliver as much as I expected.First up, the plot was interesting, women are infertile so there haven't been any babies born in the past 18 years. But then there is a girl who somehow got pregnant, and they need to get her to the 'Human Project' to get her safe and have her baby. Her baby is due in a month as well. The predictability of the plot kind of disappointed me, but I guess they tried.The acting was, alright. Clive Owen does a great job in it, but I guess I'm just a big fan of his and he hasn't really let me down yet. The camera work was spectacular, the special effects and the setting was also very good. Also the soundtrack they used was also great.Time to time I got kind of bored, or thought what was going on was stupid and decided to question the movie. But I guess you can do that in any movie. It doesn't bother explaining the reason women are infertile but I guess it's a mystery to the people in the movie as well. Like another post on here said it makes you think a lot about the future, and possibly what might come up.Overall I don't know if this movie is worth the money, I wish I could tell you to wait or not, but seeing as how I don't pay to see movies, I can't really tell if it would be worth my money.",7,1,3,10 January 2007
World Trade Center," Don't Sleep; Don't Sleep; Almost did
","I was looking forward to this movie early in the summer, then I stared watching most of the movies that were expected to be good and I was let down so I stopped looking forward to this believing it was to be a let down, I was right. I really disliked this movie for many reasons.First of all, the casting was bad. I dislike who they chose to be police men, wives, firefighters; everyone. And the people who they chose were bad actors. Throughout the movie I couldn't feel any emotion from them, any pain, any happiness; nothing. Even Nicholas Cage was disappointing.But there is a lot more. There is no character development. No stories really to the people that are trapped or dieing. I didn't feel sorry for them or felt any emotion. You see a little bit of their family but you don't see how much they love them before hand then you see them suffering because they might not see them again. I felt like they didn't care that they wouldn't see their family again.I'm not a cop, or firefighter or anything like that but wouldn't they be more cautious walking around all that rubble. Or even in the building, why would they keep so many people inside the burning trade center; wouldn't they move them out of there? Maybe not; if you disagree with this point maybe I could this part wrong.It was overall boring as well. All it was is people talking; more people talking; more; more; more, nothing else besides talking. I was really bored after they got trapped because nothing happened; at all. Even when they were looking for them it wasn't interesting.The only reason I give this a 2 is because it looked cool at times, yes call me evil or what ever but it looked cool at times. But I would not recommend you seeing this. Instead go rent 'Ladder 49' it's a way better movie of someone trapped in rubble and it has a lot more affection, emotion, story and everything to it.",2,26,51,10 August 2006
The Descent," The Descent
",From the creators of Saw and Hostel bring a movie that is supposto push other movies over the edge. But is it actually....I guess but you could throw a lot more gore into a movie.Some girls go into a cave....and they run into weird cave creatures. It doesn't explain why they're in there but they randomly kill stuff. The plot is really...unexplained unless I missed that part.The gore is okay. Since it's in a cave it's really dark so you can't see it very well which is kind of disappointing. And it's not all that great....Blood squirts out everywhere but not really gory like.....Which wasn't really great but oh well.The acting was pretty bad throughout the whole movie. Maybe because I'm not used to British actors or something like that. But the movie really didn't show any emotion. Like when their friend died the other girls really didn't care.Overll I wouldn't recommend this movie because the first half is probably boring and the second half isn't all that great.,3,1,4,13 August 2006
Step Up," Step Up
","Some people say they're tired of dancing movies, but not me. If you ignore the fact that there's other dance movies you'll enjoy this one. I guess you can say some of the dance movies are the same but what does that have to do with enjoying the flow of the movie? The story is.....well I guess you can decide on that. A girl needs to have a dance routine to impress spokespeople for dance companies, so she needs to have a good routine to impress the people so she can get a job with one of them instead of going out to college. But her main dance partner hurts himself so who will take her spot? Some punk from another school who got caught vandalizing her school so he has community service at her school. So it ends up that he becomes her new partner and they fall in love but she has a boyfriend so there's conflicts.The acting in this movie was good and bad. First off all each of the cast acted well. They each pulled their own weight. But but them together and they fall apart. The main two people didn't have chemistry, and you didn't believe that a guy like that could get with a girl like that in that type of scenario.Now where the movie gets good. The dancing and music. First of all the soundtrack is amazing. I loved every song they had in this movie especially how they took 2 songs and mixed it to make it sound a lot better. Even though other movies have done this before I really enjoyed the music in this movie especially. Now about the dancing. The choreography is really great. The directing of all of it was amazing. You have to give the people who played the kids in this movie kudos for being able to do that. It's amazing what some people can do.Overall I loved this movie. Yes I am a guy who loved a dancing movie, just to show you how this movie can appeal to everyone. I would really recommend seeing this.",9,2,6,21 August 2006
Happy Feet," Happy Feet
","I recently got to watch this movie. I've been counting down to see it for about 80 days or so, I was extremely excited for it, so I came into the movie with high expectations. Did the movie reach my expectations? No. Almost? No not really.First of all I would like to say I loved the cuteness of this movie. The way the penguins went along with their jokes and looks was adorable. That is the part of the movie I loved and just because of it I will go see it a few more times. Also the animation was beautiful except for in a few spots I could tell they didn't give it their best to make it look as great as they could, but no ones perfect are they?But now what I didn't like about this movie. The plot was kind of bad. I'm assuming what the producer was trying to do is put as many big names into the movie to try and make us forget about the plot. But if you do pay attention to it, it's not the greatest, it's actually a disappointment.Next I don't know why but I didn't really like their choices in music. Like in the trailers I thought I would have loved it, I thought it would have been amazing but it also disappointed me. Some of the songs are kind of rusty and not performed as well as I was expecting.Overall this movie really didn't live up to my expectations for it, but there were some parts I really did enjoy about this movie so I will see it maybe....2 or 3 more times.",6,10,24,13 November 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Talladega Nights
","Will has made many movies that have made me laugh out loud, and he keeps bringing them to the screen; Talladega Nights is no exception. I loved this movie; one of the only movies of the year that has delivered its excpecation.Ricky Bobby (Will Farrell) is a race car driver who always comes in first because his best friend always helps him while giving up coming in first for Ricky but he does because he's his best friend. Until a french racer comes to race against him; and he is supposto be better.Will Farrell is hilarious in this movie. Just looking at some of his expressions made me laugh. But the way he says lines makes me burst out laughing. Then the way he has jokes set up, and the way he says those with his expressions makes me laugh so hard I cry. It's a great movie if your in a laughing mood.The way everything looks is awesome. The cars, people, race track, crowds, everything. Just watching this movie makes me want to go to a race just to have the experience of how awesome it is as it displays in this movie.Overll I loved this movie, it is one of the movies of the summer for me and you should really go see it, because I will a couple more times.",10,1,3,10 August 2006
