Iron Man 3," Never Been More Let Down and Disappointed by a Movie.
","This movie made me regret going through the effort of gathering my friends up (very hard thing to do!) to go watch at 9pm on a Tuesday. Worse still I instantly felt stupid endorsing this movie to anyone who spoke about it.THE SUITS: This movie Completely wipes away all suits power! The main suit he wears is a shoddy thing that seems to built of legos. A kid fulls its finger off? Car battery to charge it?! The suits are useless they where being ripped apart by super soldiers left right and centre even a truck destroys on with light cosmetic damage to itself. On a similar note don't make even the henchmen invincible and more powerful than Iron Man.THE PLOT TWIST: NO! No no no no was all I could think when Ben Kingsley went from a sophisticated mastermind, evil preacher of vengeance to Russel Brant in Bed time stories. Why have such a good actor at your fingertips but throw him away just so you can make the audiences go 'what?! I didn't see that coming' its like having batman confront bane for the first time in the sewers only to have him turn out to be a stupid lame stand up comedian.WAR MACHINE: Wasted! They introduce us to war machine in IM2 'great can't wait to see him in a full length movie' he does nothing! Flys around, and worst of all doesn't even really us that awesome cannon on his shoulder. The henchmen final puts him to good use and actually kills people which was some relief.Iron Patriot?! Isn't that Cpt.America's role?HUMOR: Stop it!!!! For the sake of a good movie can every serious scene NOT be marred by a cheap joke? Avengers had too much but this went too far. Toilet joke? Made me mad.KID SIDEKICK: NO! JUST NO! Many more but I'm limited to how much i can rant.",4,4,8,3 May 2013
