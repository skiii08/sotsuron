The King's Speech," Unique and inspiring
","I think that Tom Hooper's The King's Speech is unlike any other movie ever produced. Some people get bored with historical movies but it is impossible to get sick of this one. This flick is not the typical Hollywood film with the typical happy ending either. Instead this film takes you on a ride through time, exposing a British King's life. The movie begins with King George VI, played by Colin Firth, nervously awaiting the speaking platform for the closing speech of the Empire Exhibition in Wembly, England. He stands thee vulnerable, exposed, and embarrassed, as he stutters through the entire speech. I think that this role is one of Colin Firth's best. Right off the bat Colin draws you in. You automatically feel for his character. His stammer is so believable! Colin allows you to walk in the King's shoes, having the entire world listen to him stutter through every speech. I experienced a roller-coaster of emotions watching this film. In the beginning King George's arrogance and unwillingness to cooperate made me feel extremely frustrated. As he begins to trust himself and his new speech therapist, Mr. Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, it's impossible not to feel reassured as an audience member. Lionel works his magic by giving King George confidence and something he has never had, a genuine friend. Director Tom Hooper deserves a round of applause for the well rounded, historically accurate plot. He uncovers many sides to King George and describes the events, both public and private, that made him who he was. Hooper shows us the meaning of friendship, family, perseverance, trust and most importantly overcoming adversity. This movie is for all ages young and old. I think that the actors and makers of this film deserve every Oscar and Academy Award given to them. I give The King's Speech a standing ovation.",Null,0,1,22 September 2011
