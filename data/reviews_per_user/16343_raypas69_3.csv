Skyfall," What a 50th birthday gift for 007. Sean Connery was finally given his successor in maybe the best Bond movie ever!
","After the Pierce Brosnan era, it had become painfully clear 007 was in desperate need of a thorough renewal. 'Die Another Day' in my opinion was the absolute low point. Main reason was that the movie went completely over the top. Another reason was that after 40 years the character was still stuck in the 60's and never evolved in any way. He had become superficial and predictable which in the end made him pretty dull, a caricature actually. But then in 2006 there was Daniel Craig in 'Casino Royale' and what an entrance he made. The storyline went back to basic and James Bond became a man of flesh and blood. All of a sudden he became a character of great interest again. He absolutely still is 007 but now he has his flaws and weaknesses but above all the predictability in his character is gone. The necessary update from the 60's to the present has finally been made. The movie itself was fantastic and perfectly showed the enhanced 007 to the world. Sadly enough 'Quantum Of Solace' was not able to match 'CR' but still it was way better then most Bond movies in let's say the past 30-35 years. And now there is 'Skyfall' and I have to say Sam Mendes has not let me down. The movie exceeded every expectation I had, it is even better than 'CR'. To me in every aspect, from start to end, 'Skyfall' really hit the spot. In his 3 movies Craig has been able to dust of James Bond and he finally successfully guided 007 into the 21st century. Until 'Skyfall' Sean Connery has always been THE James Bond. His successors (Lazenby, Moore, Dalton & Brosnan) have shown to be no more than acceptable and ultimately almost forced James Bond down on his knees. Craig with his interpretation luckily brought him back to life and in such a successful way that Connery may have to share the no. 1 position with Craig. He made the realization of the new James Bond a fact but at the same time he also brought him back to the very first beginning. And that, at least to me, is the best 50th anniversary present I as a Bond fan could get ... I was given back James Bond!",10,2,17,3 November 2012
Hotel Mumbai," Hotel Mumbai left me speechless ....
","'Hotel Mumbai' is a definate must see for this has been one the most intense movies I've seen in the last few years and I've seen a lot. Of course I saw this on the news 11 years ago but after matching this movie, I realize how horrific and traumatizing this nightmare must have been. I was glad to see it was an Australian instead of US production because it's a straight in your face movie without the fake Stars and Stripes feel to it. No slick made up heroe to polish up the story for the audience but simply showing how it actually must have been. You could really feel the fear among the hotel staff and guests who were desperately trying to survive this horrible ordeal. The director managed to portray the hotel staff as normal, terrified people doing everything they could in order trying to save their guests without making them false heroes. On the other hand there is the outrage towards the terrorists who without any mercy and emotion are just randomly kiling innocent people. But at the same time also complete disbelieve on how these young men are completely brainwashed by the voice on the phone telling them it's for the Islamic cause and promising them paradise in heaven beside Allah. This picture also showed the inability with the Indian police how to handle this situation while this masacre took place. As we all know, it all came to an end but luckily for this movie, without the fake happy Hollywood ending we are used to.",9,11,28,31 May 2019
Spectre," With Spectre and Craig, the real 007 finally returns
","I saw Spectre tonight and I only need one word ... MAGNIFICENT!!! James Bond is back. After the disastrous Brosnan era which nearly meant the end of the franchise, the reanimation of James Bond of course began with Daniel Craig as the new 007 in Casino Royal. What an entrance he made. The sequel Quantum of Solace unfortunately was a bit of a letdown but still way better then Brosnan. With Skyfall the producers made a tremendous comeback and now with Spectre the return is complete, 007 at his very best. Finally again a male M, Q, Moneypenny, gadgets but not too, shaken not stirred, humour, Spectre (of course) and the all time super villain ... Ernst Stavro Blofeld. In retrospect, the previous 3 Bond movies have been a gradual build up to this climax. Spectre is really old school James Bond but at the same time with a very 21st century twist.The very strong opening begins with a few minutes long single shot scene in Mexico City. Through out the movie, at certain points, Spectre really breathed the old JB atmosphere from the Connery and Lazenby era. Especially the scenes at the Hoffler Clinic in the Alpes, on the train and at the Blofeld HQ inside the crater strongly reminded me of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love and You Only Live Twice. Also the title song scene with the specific references to Casino Royal, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall is something we already saw in OHMSS. I really have to compliment Sam Mendes on that. First with Skyfall and now with Spectre, he made 2 excellent Bond movies we had not seen in a few decades.And what about the different characters? Christopher Waltz plays a very strong Blofeld. A creepy, sadistic, megalomaniac madman. Very Blofeld worthy so to say. Dave Bautista is the good old bad muscles, a crossing between Robert Shaw (Major Grant in FRWL) and Jaws. Monica Bellucci and LÃ©a Sedoux are two gorgeous Bond women. The only little disappointment I had, if there was one, is the really small part that La Bellucci has in the movie. I expected her to have a bigger role. Ralph Fiennes portrays a very convincing M in his first appearance and Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are very satisfying as Moneypenny and Q.And for Daniel Craig's performance? That's quite simple. With these 4 Bond movies under his belt, he has definitely proved to be the one and only true successor of Sean Connery, still the best 007 ever. I really hope he's going to do a 5th Bond movie because I really can't think of any other actor (not Hugh Jackman, not Idris Elba, not Damian Lewis) who is able to play this part.",10,19,42,30 October 2015
