Alien 3," A pathetic movie, which I'd never seen all of
","Anyone who enjoyed the first 2 films, especially the 2nd film would be disappointed at this one. Set in a prison colony where no one has any guns, why would one make a movie like this? To those who don't want a violent movie, watch a drama... you don't make a storyline with ferocious creatures like that in a movie where no guns are present. The aliens proved to be kickass creatures in the first 2 films, and in this one, they should've been dispatched in the same manner as in the 2nd one.Simply killing off Newt & Hicks was a bad idea too. They fought hard in the 2nd film, and deserve better.I heard about the plot and only saw bits & pieces of this movie. I had no desire to see it at all, after I heard about the no guns. It just wasn't worth it to me.",1,217,230,25 December 2007
Mission: Impossible," Horrible plot. Destroys the original series...
","As a child growing up in the 70s and 80s, I enjoyed the original series immensely. The characters were very good, and the plot lines were totally enjoyable.This movie destroys the original series. Had it been a brand new story, then it would've been great. Jim Phelps is an iconic character in the original series who never would have gone bad, and betray his team. Watched this movie once, and never even considered watching the sequels. It angered me so much, that cannot stand it.Why did such an iconic program of the past have to be ruined by this movie?",1,4,6,1 January 2012
