The Incredible Hulk," The Hulk version that won't leave you turning green
","When rumours of a new Hulk film began to surface after the Ang lee version, reservations set in the hearts of many of movie goers, however, when it emerged this was to be a reboot, curiosity began to grow and after setting foot out of the cinema having heard the words “Hulk smash”, any reservations about this film had indeed been smashed.With the remnants of Ang Lee’s 2003 Hulk still prevalent in people’s minds, Louis Leterrier’s take of ‘The Incredible Hulk’ draws influence from the 80’s TV serious, with nostalgic music pieces and recreated scenes. Since the creation of the hulk from gamma ray exposure was commonly know, rather than invest heavily in to an origin story, write Zak Penn condenses it down to a neat little montage incorporated into the opening credit to allow for the story to take full steam from a spectacular opening shot of the slums of Brazil. In his new fugitive life, genius scientist Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton leads a solitary life seeking a cure and some control for seemingly incurable condition. All the while he is evading a US government search for him led by General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross and his new recruit Blonsky, a 39 year old unaccomplished soldier trying to make a name for himself wanting the power of Banner, which he inevitably gets to become Abomination.Taking influence from the Bourne films, ‘The Incredible Hulk’ opens with an edge of the seat chase through Rio leading to a brief opening glimpse of the Hulk and is an excellent setup to what continues as a well thought out film. When Hulk finally makes his full appearance on screen we can see that a much more generous input has gone into the CGI work. The actions sequences that follow will leave you in awe and the brute force, sumo style culminating fight will ultimately satisfy the child in you. Norton is excellent as Banner and able to bring a sense of desperation and inner torment to this role, but the film doesn’t really attempt to develop this or take the same risks to any level similar to what Ang Lee set out to do and we only see really see one side of Norton character. Liv Tyler as Elizabeth ‘Betty’ Ross, playing Banners empathetic love interest left a sweet feeling and gave an overall decent enough performance. Even with the obvious ‘bad guy’ stereotyping of Blonsky being Russian and British, the talents of Tim Roth still managed to come out of a one dimensional character.So, with Leterriers playing the right cards are there any faults? Well, asides some unnecessary cameos and limited character exploration, ‘The Incredible Hulk’ manages to hit all the right buttons – it is a comic book adaptation done well with themes that not only make it work on screen but allows your average view to get involved with the central character, if only slightly. With comic to films adaptations having no end in sight and the as we enter the new dawn of marvel films with darker themes and crossover universes ‘The Incredible Hulk’ manages to keep the bar raised high and is the best possible pit stop to the climax of the summer blockbuster...The Dark Knight.",7,3,5,17 June 2008
Batman Begins," The Dark Knight rises! Batman Begins is the best Batman film... Goodnight Joel Schumacher
","After eight years since Joel Schumacher buried the Batman franchise with 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman & Robin', anticipations for Nolan's arrival were high and I was not disappointed. Batman makes a welcome return to our screens with a much darker take that surpasses Burton's 1989 efforts. The film had a budget exceeding $140 million, with a cast line up including Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, Sir Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Rutger Hauer and was set up to be a explosive summer blockbuster, however 'Batman Begins' delivers what is an intelligent picture, with something that feels more like an independent film, keeping CGI to a minimum, thankfully. For me the strongest supporting role comes from Gary Oldman, who is excellent as Jim Gordon, one of the few good cops in Gotham and delivers some excellent lines. Casting Christian Bale as the lead role was perfect, who as usual delivers a fine performance and after seeing Bale bring to life the dynamics Bruce Wayne and Batman it is hard to vision anyone filling the suit as effortlessly and brilliantly 'Batman Begins' has managed to draw upon the original ideas of the comics, which will please the comic book fans out there, but has still managed to encapsulate those who have little knowledge of the comics or history. We are able to see the origins of Batman from a lost, angry and tortured Bruce Wayne, rising to become a city hero. The origin seems to be the focus of the film as Batman doesn't really appear until the first hour of the film, but it is well worth the wait! The film also shows the side of Bruce Wayne being a billionaire playboy, where we are able to recognise Bale bringing elements of his role as Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.The film is shot and directed well against the backdrop of a crime filled corrupt Gotham and we can see the influences of Frank Miller. The film also has a fitting soundtrack, although I did prefer Danny Elfman's score. However one big problem with this film is the fight scenes have not been done well as the editing is too fast, it is difficult to see what is happening and see the skill's that Batman has learnt which leaves a rather unsatisfied feeling. Also most the explosions, which may seem out of place, have probably been included to increase the appeal of the film to a wider audience.This film is not for everyone and cinema goers looking for a fast paced summer action blockbuster will be disappointed, possibly due to the false expectations delivered by a fast-cut misleading trailer. Nolan has resurrected Batman and brought to it intelligence, darkness and dignity and With Nolan continuing to direct and Bale as Batman the sequels are sure to have success, but be sure that when Robin is introduced this will see the end of Batman once more.",9,0,0,29 June 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," The worst film of the year
","I went to see this movie with high hopes and an open mind, as the previous X-Men films have remained to be one of my favourite comic-to-film conversions to date. Mainly because they took a comic series which was great to read and could have been disastrous on screen, but ended up being great films. However, with most of the production crew changed, it was instantly recognisable that there was a different feel and less intelligent driving force behind the third instalment of the X-Men series, in which there were too many things that were not handled well.The first fifteen minutes of the film did give me high hopes, as I saw a lot of things from the comic come to life on screen such as a The Morlocks and the training room scene (I'm trying not to dwell too much on the comics). However these hopes were soon crushed as soon I realised this film was nothing more than a series of action sequences put together around a really poor idea.Bryan Singer and Bret Ratner clearly had different visions for the X-Men series. Bryan Singer opted for the storyline based approach, providing a decent background for each character he involved and making everything move at a steady pace, where as Brett Ratner decided to go to town with the special effects crew, giving this film as much depth as a teaspoon and cramming it all in to about 100 minutes. What really annoyed me was how Brett Ratner was undoing all the work that Bryan Singer had done, mainly by killing of characters for no apparent reason, changing the personality of existing characters and putting in a lot of nonsense scenes in just so he could introduce some new character! It also seemed like Brett Ratner had no clue how to continue where Bryan Singer had left off in the second film with the Phoenix storyline and simply decided to make Jean Grey do an impression of Carrie throughout the film and ruin that story. I personally think it should have been left out entirely as it is too big a storyline to be a sub plot and instead should have had its own film dedicated to it.There are, however, a few good points to this film too. For example, Halle Berry played the part of Storm as a stronger character and had more screen time, which allowed her to become like the Storm from the comics and gave a good performance doing so. It was also nice to see Juggernaut, played by Vinnie Jones, on screen, although it's not much of a stretch for Vinnie Jones to play an angry thug.The best thing about this movie was Kelsey Grammar's whose performance of Beast was great and was definitely the highlight of the film for me.Overall this film had no lasting emotion or substance to it and the closing scenes emphasise that. After seeing this film it did make me appreciate how much of a good job Bryan Singer had done for the first two X-Men movies and filled me with a lot of hope and anticipation for Superman Returns.",1,0,1,11 June 2006
Gran Torino," Another great film from Eastwood
","'Gran Torino' takes its title from a vintage car belonging to Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) a racist war veteran with an indiscriminate hatred towards everyone, including his own spoilt family. An attempted theft of this car, coupled with an unintentional act of heroism helps forge a relationship with his Asian neighbours and his own redemption.It is clear that Eastwood is an excellent director, taking a script that in lesser hands could have been a trite affair and grafts a tale that is suspenseful and emotionally engaging telling a story about violence, vengeance and racial tensions in American culture that instantly gets your attention and holds it.While this is not Eastwood's strongest performance, it is one that is worthy for his final acting role, playing Kowalski in a way reminiscent of Dirty Harry and still maintaining a charismatic and powerful screen presence. A fine performance also comes from the unknown Ahney Her, who brings warmth in her on screen debut.'Gran Torino' is an excellent outing for Eastwood, paced well with tactful blend of humour and a simple narrative of morals; but to make this film go that extra mile one could only wish that the film was more subtle rather than making every message so overt to the viewer.",8,1,7,27 July 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Button is a Big disappointment
","You can tell it is Oscar season when films like 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' are released, a film telling the story of a man born old, who ages backwards in almost a reworking of 'Forrest Gump' (both films sharing the same screen writer). The films premise does not really get any further than that, nor does it present any real insight allowing Benjamin Button or the audience to see things differently, or indeed develop into any sort of character. Instead we see the story of a fairly regular man experiencing a somewhat regular life for the time: growing up, going to war, falling in love and dying, and with very little said about Benjamin's condition.While there may be people that say the focus of the film is the love story between Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett that is not the case as they never have any good chemistry on screen. Most of the appeal for Button comes not from the script or even the direction of David Fincher, but mainly the visuals of ageing effects. It is certainly not the performance of Pitt's career. From the director that gave us 'Fight Club', 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac' 'Benjamin Button' will come as a big disappointment.",4,4,8,27 July 2009
The Departed," A real gem and simply brilliant...but don't forget the original!
","Based on the Hong Kong masterpiece 'Infernal Affairs', Martin Scorsese delivers what is an instant classic with profundity and after a few misguided films (such as 'Bringing out the Dead') Scorsese is back on top form with 'The Departed'. From the opening frames of Jack Nicholson and the bone-crunching chords of 'The Rolling Stones', we can see Scoresese's talent and dexterity shines through at the highest level and you know this is a ride that will thrill you and keep you attentive until it fades to black.Set in present day Boston, with Irish gangsters dominating the state, 'The Departed' tells the tale of Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) undercover and assigned to infiltrate the mob run by crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). While Costigan gains Costello's trust more and more and enters into the murky crime-world, we see Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a rising Police officer through the ranks and a protégé of Costello, acting as an informant for the crime-syndicate. As we see each character getting deeper and deeper into their double life, it soon becomes apparent to the mob and the Police that a rat is in their midst, which places danger on Costigan and Sullivan's lives, who must race to expose the enemy's identity to save himself.'The Departed' has a multitude of depth to it and is able to deal with a myriad of themes such as loyalty, betrayal and relationships. We are also able to see Nietzsche philosophy of good and evil within each character as a prominent theme emerge. These are all evident throughout 'Infernal Affairs' too, however are presented slightly more subtly. 'The Departed' is not flawless and although these may be few, it is these that separate this from 'Infernal Affair', which was there first and with better results.William Monahan provides the script and with the tame and meandering 'Kingdom of Heaven' in his past now, Monahan screen writes the western take on the emotional 'Infernal Affairs' , without a dependency on its predecessor. Monahan does not restrict himself to what is in the original and is able to add a new hemisphere of further character and story development with an explosive and stinging dialogue, whether it be from Jack Nicholson's darkly wit or Mark Walberg's punchy, foul-mouth.There are buckets of gore to secure a quite just 18 certificate and it is not this that Scorsese uses to create high amounts of drama. It is well-directed scenes with little dialogue and it is these that produce a dynamic tension that is only comparable to that of Hitchcock.As far as the casting goes, it seems as though everyone brought their A game to the film. DiCaprio continues to show us no end to his ability as an actor as we see his character slowing descending to a breaking point. Matt Damon is also able to give a highly emotional and complex performance, while Nicholson is able to bring characteristics of his role as 'The Joker' and reach's unprecedented heights of evil with what is undoubtedly one of his finest performances. With an equally glamorous and star filled supporting cast we see talent and charisma ooze through from the likes of Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen. Vera Farmiga is a wonderful actress who brings a mix of sex-appeal and intelligence to her role. Although Walberg's performance is one of the finest and most memorable of the film, it almost feels as though he creates a slight obstacle between what should have been a more emotional and father-son type relationship between DiCaprio and Sheen's characters.Leaving those unnecessary questions behind such as 'Is it Scorsese's year at the Oscars?' and watching 'The Departed' with an open mind and heart, you will forget some of the minor flaws, shout at the screen as you are rooting for both DiCaprio and Damon and love every minute of the next best thing since Goodfellas!",8,0,1,13 October 2006
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Sweet Story in New York
","Dumped and broken hearted, Nick (Michael Cera) still holds a torch for his ex, until one eventful evening he meets Norah (Kat Dennings) and thus ensues a sleepless night of finding friends, music and love changing their lives. Think 'American Graffiti' think 'High Fidelity' put these in a film with a MySpace generation dialogue then you get 'Nick and Norah'.From the opening credits it will be relatively easy to see where this film is heading from the slow guitar music to Cera, painting his career in to a corner effortlessly playing the ever jittery, romantic man-child we've seen in 'Arrested Development' and 'Juno'. The film almost seems reliant on its soundtrack, which although sits well with the film, there is nothing quite as defining as 'High Fidelity' largely due to the drama unfolding in front of us not being able to lift it and a lack of the same sharp wit and dialogue.The above is not to say the film is bad as Cera is charming and works on screen as Nick opposite the unconventionally beautiful Dennings in a nice dynamic chemistry. It is also one of the few rom-com's that gets it right, managing to tell a sweet, well paced story over one night against the backdrop of Manhattan.",6,0,0,27 July 2009
The Wrestler," One of the best films of the year
","When 'Sin City' hit the cinemas back in 2005, Mickey Rourke's career was resurrected after an outstanding performance as Marv. Now, under the helm of acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky, Rourke returns in the poignant and brilliant 'The Wrestler'. In his glory days Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) was a headlining professional wrestler. Twenty years on, we find Randy wrestling in local communities to smaller crowds. After suffering a major heart attack and forced retirement, Randy decides to seek out his estranged daughter to forge a meaningful relationship, while at the same time the glamour of wrestling has offered him one more match from his glory days pulling him back in to the game.While there is no myth surrounding the pantomime of wrestling, Aronofsky has sculpted a story combining the broken life of a struggling soul and some of the harsh natures of the sport, to bring us a film about loneliness and second chances. It is clear that Rourke has bought elements of his own turbulent life to the role, where one can often get lost in his amazing performance. The directing and narrative of Aronofsky are flawless, as are the supporting roles, but 'The Wrestler', emotionally driven, unquestionably belongs to Mickey Rourke.",8,1,1,27 July 2009
Defiance," Another holocaust movie...
","The inspirational story of family, honour and vengeance is told through 'Defiance'. Set in Poland, 1941 amidst the invasion of the Nazi's, with Jew's being massacred by the thousands, Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell star as the Belski brothers who manage to take refuge in a surrounding Forrest where they begin a enduring struggle for survival. As word of their refuge spreads, others come to join them for freedom.Director Edward Zwick presents a riposte to the many holocaust films of Jews as long-suffering passive victims with a true story where they strong heroes. 'Defiance', however, gets caught between depicting facts and including Hollywood clichés, where unfortunately the latter dominates. There are strong performances all round, despite a script of largely proclamations, with Craig putting in a credible performance as the reluctant leader of the group, challenged by Schreiber, with his contrasting views of survival and ideas of revenge. Bell is also able to offer a decent supporting role, showing a positive transition from the naive youngest brother into a stronger adult. While the story of the Belski brother's is amazing, 'Defiance' offers an engaging, if somewhat overstretched, adaptation that does not leave the afterthought it set out to.",5,2,6,27 July 2009
Fantastic Four," Nothing Spectacular
","With other comic book films such as Spider-man, X-men and more recently Batman, bringing the comic to life and generating wide appeal and high amounts of entertainment, Fantastic four leaves a lot to be desired. Fantastic four tells the story of five individuals who go on a mission in outer space and after being caught in a storm develop different super-powers. Four of these use their powers to stop the Dr. Doom carrying out his plans and using his power for evil.The fantastic four does reach a young audience and will generate a lot of money, however it is not really that good a film. Although the film is aimed at the under 12's it does manage to neglect appealing to all other age groups through lack of substance and plot. Fantastic four has its problems, most of which lie with the direction of Tim Story. One thing about the direction I didn't like was the transitions throughout the film are not clear and have an effect on the flow of the film . Also it feels like Story has relied on the big budget CGI's to carry the film rather than making the actors he's got work with a messy script.The general essence of this film is the characters trying to establish themselves and develop as superheroes and little else is memorable about the plot. One thing I would have liked to have seen is more of a rivalry between the heroes and the villains to develop in this film as the other marvel comics films have been able to manage e.g. X-men, The Punisher, Spider-man. This, however, is possibly due to the short length of the film and having to cram other stuff in. Having said this fantastic four doesn't really have much else in terms of story except the lacklustre romance element with Mr Fantastic and The invisible girl.Julian McMahon brings a small element of darkness to the film, however, this is only a crumb of what is needed to give this film and the characters some depth and engross and adult audience. I don't think Julian McMahon had much of a chance to act in this film as he does in nip/tuck where he is able to bring some real emotion to the character and the show, this can probably be attributed to the fact in Fantastic Four he had some pretty awful lines to deliver, which ultimately reflect a poor and cheesy writing.",5,0,1,14 August 2005
