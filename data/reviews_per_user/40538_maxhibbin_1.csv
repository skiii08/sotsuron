Iron Man 3," Superhero movie without a superhero
","Pathetic. Good villain, I guess, however not the mandarin. Why even put his name in there? The superhero was missing... Weak, vulnerable, suits that don't work, anxiety attacks! A stupid voice-over? Nothing to match the villain with. Raiding the compound like a boy scout, the list goes on. Where was the Iron Man of the Avengers? Why didn't Jon Favreau direct? Shane Black wasn't able to capture anything which made the first two movies. A thorough disappointment all round.",2,4,8,3 May 2013
