Hereditary," Wait for it to come to tv.
","I am very easily scared by horror movies and it takes very little to have me squinting through my eyes at the screen, not with this one though!
I jumped once.
So much didn't flow and I just didn't find the suspense building which is what usually has me hiding my eyes. Lots of things weren't explained properly and the ending was 'err what?'.
Great acting though, as usual Toni Colette was fab. Just the god awful ridiculous story line, I mean really wtf were those things at the end?
I'm sure professional critics get paid on the sly to rate films. The amount of times I have seen a movie slated that was really good or vice versa astounds me.
I want a film that looks pretty good and has a half decent story line. That's all.",5,1,2,15 June 2018
This Is the End," This was Great
",I really enjoyed this much to my surprise.You definitely have to like the kind of humour Seth Rogen has to enjoy this movie. I would skip it if he isn't your cup of tea. I loved it and hubby was chuckling all the way through too.,8,1,2,18 July 2018
Bird Box," Dull as dishwater! And no I am not a Netflix snob, thanks!
","To the reviewers who liked it that are name calling, get over yourselves! We ALL like different things for different reasons and that does not warrant trying to belittle others that have a differing opinion to yours! So juvenile!I watched half an hour, started off promising and grabbed my attention, but then I just got bored, very quickly, it was all just so very predictable.Great cast and really good acting, shame about the story. I really couldn't bear to watch anymore than I did.",2,1,3,28 December 2018
