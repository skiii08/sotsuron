Requiem for a Dream," An earth shattering, gut wrenching masterwork
","I have just watched 'Requiem for a Dream' and it is unlike no other film I have ever seen.  It is so savage, so unmitigated in its horrific images, so twisted and intense that it simply appeared to me as earth shattering. Ellen Burstyn's performance is the highlight of her career, as her portrayal of Sara Goldfarb is nothing short of brilliant.  Through haunting visuals, combining the surrealistic dreamworld of the addict with the horrifying nightmare that lies between highs, Aronosofsky moves beyond the enigmatic pretenses of his first work PI, and into a bold new world.  Nothing anyone said prepared me for this movie, with its utterly honest and terrifying depiction of addiction, it is so much more intriguing than anything else I have ever seen on the subject (the closest would be 'Trainspotting' and that is distant).  A word of advice to the viewer, however.  If you do not have a strong stomach this movie is not necessarily for you.  The entire movie is dizzying and nauseating, not because of any specific visuals but because of its astounding intensity.",9,0,1,4 October 2003
Casablanca," The best of a golden age **** (out of ****)
","Casablanca is everything movies should be.  It's quick wit, fascinating performances and wonderful story is the very definition of a classic. Humphrey Bogart turns in the performance of his life, while Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid and Claude Raines are all perfect as supporting cast.  Easily, one of the best loved, most quoted, and still, most entertaining films ever made.  Here's looking at you, kid.",10,1,1,11 September 2003
Se7en," A dark, shocking work of near-masterpiece proportions
","I first saw this movie when I was eight, and, just to show how much my generation is desensitized, it didn't scare me.  Having seen it several times since, I now realize that this is in fact one of the most shocking films ever made.  Between 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', David Fincher has created two flawed masterpieces.  Se7en itself is brilliantly done, with a horrifying, remarkable twist ending, and Kevin Spacey as John Doe, a serial killer on par with Hannibal Lecter.  The only flaw with this movie is it's lack of deeper morals.  Sure, it shows the overall evils of today's world, but it feels as though it's missing something essential, a feeling of humanity.",9,0,0,15 March 2003
The Big Lebowski," The Big Lebowski
","In modern film, there are only a very few people who can be consistently counted on to bring out intriguing, odd movies.  Perhaps the two most prominent of these people are Joel and Ethan Coen, creators of such masterpieces of 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple'.  While most of their previous work has been critically acclaimed, it wasn't truly until 'Fargo' that the pair became more universally known.  'The Big Lebowski' is proof that the duo have past a rare test.  They have transferred their concept of quirky filmmaking to the mainstream, while retaining their biting sense of humor. This film is truly hysterical, and at times poignant.  Its a black comedy that is truly a delight to watch.  Jeff Bridges and John Goodman have fantastic chemistry and the dialogue shows the biting satirical, yet overt comedic prose that the Coen Brothers have mastered in previous masterpieces.",10,0,2,1 February 2003
Memento," One of the best thrillers of all time.
","I was one of very few mainstream viewers who saw Memento in the theatres. Later, when it was out on DVD, it became such a sleeper hit, spread by word of mouth, that practically everybody I knew had seen it. The words 'short-term memory' loss became a key gimick in film and television. The concept of a movie, flowing out of sequence, generally unused since Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, now came back with a vengeance, forming such films as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Memento truly deserves to be called one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The concept of a man who cannot make new memories trying to locate his wife's murderer is a brilliant, but the impetus used by putting it in reverse is shattering. We experience the world of Leonard Shelby, whose short-term memory was destroyed in the same incident that saw the murder and rape of his wife, as he searches for the murderer, the mysterious John G. Tattooed with key information, Leonard is the centre of a drama involving three people: himself, Natalie, and Teddy. The story begins at the end, with LEonard finding Teddy to in fact be the John G. he has been searching for, and murdering him. Thus, Leonard is the romantic hero out for revenge. But as the story unfolds, new faces are revealed. The notes which he lives his life by, written on the backs of photographs, have their genesis one after the other, characterizing who he trusts and who he doesn't. A mark on Teddy's photo, reading 'Do not believe his lies,' renders everything Teddy says, in Leonard's mind, false. Thus, for much of the film, we feel close to Leonard, sympathise with him, distrust Teddy, and see Natalie as the kind lover and helper. But as facts are revealed, these things begin to change. Natalie is revealed as a truly sinister character, using Leonard's condition to get rid of her enemies. Teddy's advice begins to sound practical, and true. Yet only in the final scene are we shown Leonard's real face: the bloodthirsty killer whose memory creates a vacuum into which all guilt and responsibility vanish, and who, never being able to fulfill his vengeance, and unable to heal by time, is driven by the soul purpose of destruction, by an enigma he created himself. In the final scene, we are left with a genuine feeling of unease. Why? Because we have attached ourselves to these characters as what they were revealed as at the beginning, we have sympathised with them, and never knowing where they came from, were content to assume by the present. But in the end, we find ourselves close to a psychotic, a murderer, a sociopath whose memory destroys all fulfillment and remorse, in other words, a mad man.",10,0,2,4 October 2005
The Godfather: Part II," The beautiful completion of a wondrous film arc **** (out of ****)
","The Godfather, Part II, The Two Towers and The Empire Strikes Back:  these are the only sequels to match the original.  What do thesee have in common? They are all continuations of a saga, rather than just additional stories. I do not distinguish necessarily between the greatness of the Godfather Parts I and II.  It is the same story, and both movies are ten times as good when viewed together in a 6 and a half hour marathon.  In Part II, an incredibly slow first hour concerning Michael's trying to find the people who want him killed, this returns to the compelling family drama that is truly the essence of the Godfather.  In the meantime, the story of young Vito, played by a young but still brilliant Robert De Niro, unfolds, intertwining his rise with the moral fall of Michael.  At the end, the arc is complete, and the final shot of MIchael sitting amongst the falling leaves, a man who has lost his family and his soul, a man totally alone, so unlike the innocent at the beginning of Part I, is the greatest end shot in history.",10,0,1,11 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkien's Brilliant Vision Realized Into A Perfect Film
","For the thousands of fans who thought it couldn't be done, to the skeptics and the critics who observed Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord Of The Rings into a trilogy would be the next Ishtar, a disaster of epic proportions, allay your fears.  The Lord Of The Rings:  The Fellowship Of The Ring is the most daring cinematic event to take place in years, and despite the fact it undeservedly lost the best picture oscar to A Beautiful Mind, it is, I strongly believe, a film for the ages.  NOt since Gone With THe Wind has an epic tale, critically acclaimed, been adapted into a film which is astounding in its own right.  The sets are marvelous, the characters portrayed to perfection (Most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf), and the mythology of Middle-Earth brought to vivid life, combining to make a film that is both spectacular in its grandeur and engaging in its characters.  This is a film I believe equal to Lawrence Of Arabia in its scope, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel THe Two Towers being released this Christmas.",10,5,5,26 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A cinematic milestone!
","Peter Jackson's The Lord Of THe Rings:  The Fellowship Of The Ring is, without a doubt, one of the most spectacular epics ever made!  Not since Gone With The Wind has such a beloved novel been adapted so successfully. This is truly a fantasy to rival all fantasies, bringing Tolkien's magical Middle-Earth to the screen while at the same time holding on the myth and the characters that made the novel a classic.  Almost everyone I know loved this movie, many of whom felt it was an improvement on the book.  Even adamant Tolkien fans are pleased with the results. When I first saw Lord Of The Rings, I had never read the book.  I was looking forward to it, but, knowing little about Middle Earth, it was purely objective anticipation.  I was hoping this would be the kind of of movie we sit and wait for, the next Star Wars, or Titanic, something which the media has not overhyped, that is as good as everyone expects.  This movie surpassed all those expectations.  I have seen it 5 times in the theatre to date, and at a running time of three hours, I am still not bored of it. Enthralled by the movie's recreation of Middle-Earth, I recently read the book, mainly as an epitaph to the movie.  While it was a definite classic, I feel the movie surpassed it in characterization.  All the creatures and characters of the book were made more human by the scripting.  Ian McKellen offers a brilliant portrayal of Gandalf, while Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood make stalwart heroes.  The orcs are positively hideous, the sets of Rivendell and Lothlorien are amazing, and the story has translated to the screen beautifully.  I honestly cannot wait for the Two Towers this christmas.  I feel that Peter Jackson has given us the sort of movie we hope for.  I believe very strongly that in due time this will become a classic, reminiscient of Star Wars, yet with superb writing and beautifully portrayed characters, it manages to stay away from the cheesy dialogue that plagues the Star Wars trilogy.  This is a cinematic milestone, and I feel it was shamelessly robbed at the Oscars, where, defying all convention, being the film with the most nominations (13, the second highest amount ever) did not garner the best picture oscar.  It is a brilliant film, to be seen and seen again.",10,1,1,28 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," the star wars representative of our generation
","Having never read Lord Of The Rings, I was doubtful, but as with all epics, hopeful for the movie.  I went to the theatre the day it was released, and since then have seen it 4 times.  It is, without at doubt, the star wars representative of our generation.  It is a cultural phenomenon and one of the greatest films of this or any year.",10,1,1,19 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Cinematic perfection **** (out of ****)
","'The Fellowship of the Ring', the first volume of Peter Jackson's epic Lord of the Rings Trilogy, is an almost flawless movie that manages to span three hours without one dull moment, a feat unmatched by even 'The Godfather'. The story is, of course, merely the first third in the greatest tale of good vs. evil ever written.  The first time I saw this, I realized with excitement that this is the first time I had ever seen a piece of cinematic legend taking shape.  Great characters, beautiful execution, fabulous adventure and wondrous storytelling are the key features in this magnificent epic.  The detail that went into this work I cannot even imagine, and the perfection that it becomes I cannot believe.  If you have not seen this, rent it immediately, and while you're at it, get The Two Towers too, it's just as good.",10,1,3,11 September 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," A Vast Improvement!
","This is better. Much better. Since the Matrix Reloaded never made any attempt at a conclusion (even a temporary conclusion such as those found in Kill Bill or Lord of the Rings), it ended in a slump. And that's exactly where this film starts off. In fact the first half hour is the weakest of the trilogy, as the Wachowski's try to work out what feels like a recycled part of the last film, the conclusion that never was. Here, we are forced to endure another horrific encounter with the Merovingian (though thankfully, not nearly as long), a lobby scene sequence that is pathetic after the action we have seen in the first two films, a useless subplot involving the Trainman, and Neo trapped in Mobil (Limbo) station. This is weak, very weak. But once the film gets past it, it takes on a new life. And the results are fantastic. The Wachowskis, having decided that more is better should be the motto of the second Matrix, take a daring, dangerous, and entirely original way with this one. After the first half hour, there is no Matrix scene until the conclusive battle between Neo and Smith. Thus there is none of the mind-bending, gravity-defying action, either. And none of the philosophic pontificating that marred the second film. This takes place almost entirely in the Real World, and, though a daring move, it is a successful one. The characters take on more life here. Indeed, one could even go so far as to say they do some acting. In this film, Neo and Trinity's relationship for the first time becomes something other than a plot gimmick, and there are actually moments of chemistry. Morpheus, though a side-seat driver for the entire film, gains much more humanity after his disillusionment (it also helps that there are not philosophy lectures for him to recite.) Many of the lesser characters are rendered in three-dimensions this time (the captain of the Hammer, Niobe, Link). As for the Oracle, the sudden cast change after the death of the first one for this film does not hurt it at all. In fact, this new Oracle is much more compelling than the original, and (partially because she has a much bigger role), is the one I now think of when I think of the Matrix. First prize still has to go to Hugo Weaving, who continues his transformation in the form of Smith to diabolical levels. He is exaggerated and overplayed, in a manner that is totally successful (one is reminded of Jack Nicholson). HIs twisted sense of humour is now in perfect balance with his cold, machine like evil. Also remarkable is the actor who portrays Bane, a human occupied by Smith. He renders Hugo Weaving's mannerisms so perfectly, one thinks it is Hugo Weaving in disguise (it might be, I haven't checked.) As for the action, it is amazing. The Battle for the Docks is something completely new, and absolutely terrifying. Indeed, (and as a huge Lord of the Rings fan, this is saying something), it is comparable in adrenaline-activity to the Battle of Pelennor Fields. 250,000 sentinels turn the battleground into a nightmare apocalyptic vision. As for Neo and Trinity, there quest to the Machine City is equally fascinating, showing the surface world we have only seen briefly as another nightmare. THere is even a moment of actual poetry in which, bursting above the clouds, Trinity becomes the first human in 100 years to see the sky. The Machine City itself is something like Dr. Seuss on acid, and the Deus Ex Machina is a rather scary version of the Head of Oz. As for the final apocalyptic fight between Neo and Smith, it is just that. The effects of the rain are magnificent as the two Titans clash far above the earth. And the actual conclusion to the story, something that I had no idea how the Wachowskis would bring about after the second one, is actually pretty surprising and rather clever. All this being said, there are still flaws. The battle between Smith and Neo is great until it crashes into the ground (literally), after which, the momentum is lost, and the final effect is rather awkward. There are still horrible lines, but thankfully, most of them are just one or two lines, instead of entire dialogues. The actual ending of the film leaves something to be desired, a sunset happy-go-lucky meeting that seems to come more from Harry Potter than the Matrix. But, flaws aside, this is a much better film than Reloaded, and though no where near the masterpiece of the original, is still a worthy successor.",8,0,0,3 February 2006
American Psycho," An extremely intelligent satirical examination of materialism *** (out of ****)
","In adapting Bret Easton Ellis' controversial though tedious novel, screenwriters Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have taken the meat and essence of the source story and turned it into a fast paced, energetic, and scathing film.  Christian Bale gives an outstanding performance as the avatar of '80's materialism, Patrick Bateman, a yuppie who is cold and completely indifferent to his environment, not to mention totally insane and homicidal.  American Psycho takes the viewer on a daring journey into the darkest reaches of the human mind, and although noticeably flawed, it comes out as a thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking study of man's dark desires.",8,0,1,27 December 2002
The Shining," The Shining is one of Kubrick's best
","The Shining is one of only a handful of Stephen King adaptations that is as successful as a film as as a book (others include, in my opinion, Carrie, Misery, the Shawshank Redemption, the Green Mile, Stand by Me, and Dolores Claiborne.) It is, however, vastly different from the book (Stephen King was highly disatisfied with it), and belongs more to Kubrick's genius than King's. Numerous story changes are made, and there are numerous additions. But the end result of both is the same: a terrifying masterpiece. Jack Nicholson gives his greatest villain performance (not including the Joker) as Jack Torrance, hamming up the role and playing it so far over the top that it is great fun to watch. The story concerns Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall, not a great choice for the role), and his son Danny, who serve as winter caretakers to the secluded Overlook Hotel in the Rockies. The hotel, of course, is haunted, and its aura of death and terror soon intoxicate Jack, driving him into a murderous, cabin-fever rage to kill his family. In his typical style, Kubrick takes his time, with long shots, scenes without dialogue, and visions of the horror that the hotel represents. I have always found Kubrick a sort of icy genius, and his films for the most part are coldly intellectual. The Shining is no exception. One feels detached from the characters, as much as they are detached from each other. This matters little however. If I had to choose one word to define the Shining, I would say disturbing. It is not a slasher flick, and gets its tension from the images and situations it presents instead of from characters. There are great images that have become classic in film history ('Here's Johhhhny!!!', 'All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy,', the two dead girls, room 237, the sea of blood in the elevators, Redrum, the fight on the stairs, the ghost ballroom, and the chase through the hedge maze). Ultimately, it is a horror masterpiece, which, though utterly different from the source material, is just as terrifying as King's classic book.",10,1,3,5 March 2006
American Beauty," Perhaps The Best Film Of The 90's **** (out of ****)
","American Beauty is the most complicated and advanced character study to deal with filial and romantic relationships gone awry since Mike Nichol's Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?.  Kevin Spacey gives one of the best performances in the history of cinema, as emotionally worn Lester Burnham, whose love of life is redeemed by a lust for his daughter's 17 year old friend.  Conrad Hall's beautiful cinematography and Alan Ball's darkly comedic and incredibly brilliant screenplay exaggerates to varying degrees all aspects of the modern American family, to create a startling film that is both a caricature and a portrait.  Sam Mendes direction is flawless, and strong support comes from Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper.",10,0,0,25 December 2002
Apocalypse Now," The Greatest Film About Vietnam... Until the horribly woozy third act.
","The first two thirds of this movie are, quite simply, the best depiction of the Vietnam War in film. We follow Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), journeying upriver into Cambodia to assassinate the insane Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), through the proverbial Heart of Darkness, into the deepest depths of the chaos that was Nam. However, as soon as we get to the destination, the film goes completely downhill. The final hour really has little, if anything, to do with the Vietnam War. Instead, we a treated to a stoned Marlon Brando mouthing poetry and musing on terror in the midst of a tribal commune in a demolished temple, with Dennis Hopper adding his equally stoned commentary. Thus, Apocalypse Now collapses in on itself. From the interviews I have seen with him, Francis Ford Coppola has always struck me as an egomaniac, and here it shows. The scenes in Vietnam are philosophically rich, beautiful, haunting, and expressive of the strangest war of this past century. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter attack, with a surfing-crazed Robert Duvall trying to catch a little R and R in the midst of a heated battle is still stunning and brilliant. All the characters on the boat with Willard are widely drawn, and their journey upriver into the depths of the jungle shows a vast range of the madness that plagued the war. In Cambodia, however, the artistic philosophy of the film moves so far away from the characters, that it feels like one is attending a University lecture, given, once again, by the stoned Marlon Brando. As the redux, its worth seeing, I think, but most of the scenes don't really add very much, and some (such as the FRench Plantation), feel completely out of place and really hinder the pacing of the film.",9,1,1,27 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A true masterpiece, despite what Tolkien purists may say
","Reading over some of the IMDb comments on this film, I am truly appalled by the number of people who rant and whine about the films deviations from the book.  Film and literature are two different mediums, not to be confused, and very rarely are they entirely compatible.  Tolkien's book, while brilliant, is not the 'perfect series' as I have heard it proclaimed, and cannot be expected, even by the most adamant of fans to be portrayed to utter perfection in the movie.  Jackson's film is an utter masterpiece, giving the audience what they want, entertainment, emotion and raw pure spectacle.  Almost all of the most brilliant films of all time are not entirely faithful to the book, including 'The Godfather', in which rather large sections were left out, 'Gone With The Wind', 'The Silence Of The Lambs', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'The Bridge On The River Kwai', 'Apocalypse Now', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 'Amadeus', 'Raging Bull' and 2001.  And yes, I have read all these books so don't doubt me when I say it.  Literary structure is different from the structure of movies.  And any good screenwriter will tell you more often than not it is necessary to take liberties with a book in order to create the aesthetic of a good movie.  So the ending was changed. It will be in the next one.  So Arwen's appearance was an invention of Jackson's.  It created a bridge in her character between the first and third films.  Okay, I can understand the argument about Gimli being made into comic relief, that annoyed me too, but it did not mar my impression of the film in any way.  In no way do the legitimate complaints of people annoy me, but when I hear such comments as 'Like Merry And Pippin would ever let Frodo go to the boats, he should have snuck to them through the shadowland like in the books', I get really bothered.  Menial arguments such as this are the product of disgruntled Tolkien purists, many of whom I feel would not be satisfied even if the book followed the writer's vision perfectly.  The smallest flaws are made into an ignominious nuisance by those who, even if those flaws were not there, would still complain about something else.  I myself have read 'The Lord Of The Rings' about 6 or 7 times, and I agree it is a great book.  Yet no book is so perfect that it should not be changed in any way.  And I apologize to any Tolkien fans I am offending, but speaking from the view point of a huge literary afficionado I must say that 'The Lord Of The Rings' is not the greatest book ever written, nor is Tolkien the greatest writer.  His mammoth fantasy epic is by no means the standard for literary style, nor for characterization or meaning.  I shake my head when I hear 'The Lord Of The Rings' referred to as the quintessential novel. Despite being the greatest masterpieceo of fantasy ever written, it still does not measure up to Joyce's 'Ulysses', Dostoyevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov', or Proust's 'Remembrance Of Things Past'.  I love Dostoyevsky, yet if a movie were made of 'The Brothers Karamazov', and 'The Grand Inquisitor', perhaps one of the most incredible sections in all literature were removed, I would not damn the director, and insult the film, for I realize the scene, though essential to the writer's purpose, is not essential to the story the film is trying to portray.  If I may parody a line from 'Inherit The Wind', The Lord Of The Rings is a great book, but it is not the only book, and its brilliance as a film may not match its brilliance as a book (though in my opinion it does) but it cannot be insulted merely because it deviates from its source.",10,2,3,24 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Film vs. Book: A Rationalization
","Looking over the IMDB comment board for 'The Lord Of The Rings:  The Two Towers', I see that in general, it is as beloved as the first one.  There is, however, a fairly large group of avid Tolkien fans who feel the removal of the ending to the book would have been unnecessary if Peter Jackson had simply cut out the Aragorn/Arwen scenes.  What I hope to offer here is a rationalization as to why Jackson did what he did, and the perfectly valid justification he had for doing it.  To begin with, despite many crossovers between medias of film and literature, the two rarely mix entirely. Literature is an expression of a writer's views and ideologies on the page, and film is a visual expression of the combined vision of several people. Many books are perfect fodder for adaptations, but few pieces of literature. Imagine someone trying to adapt Joyce's 'Ulysses' to the screen, or Proust's 'Remembrance Of Things Past'.  It simply could not be done.  In most works of great literature, Dostoyevsky, Joyce, Tolstoy, Flaubert etc., the artists express themselves through the writing as a style.  Tolkien, while perhaps not on par with the supreme literary brilliance of the aformentioned authors, is still the father of fantasy, and it is his book that will be remembered as the most popular and, outside of the scholarly world, influential book of the 20th century.  So how do you make it into a movie?  Up until a few years ago, no one believed it could be.  And then Peter Jackson released 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' last year, and everyone, even the most discerning Tolkien neophytes were satisfied.  With this year's installment, 'The Two Towers', Jackson has become more daring, and has taken several liberties with the story line, most notably, excluding the last 5 chapters.  Yet I want to specify something to all the Tolkien addicts who are most enraged by this blatant cut:  word-for-word adaptations rarely ever work.  In adapting a novel to the screen, something is invariably lost if the director does not have the wits to put the film in his vision rather than the author.  If the author wanted to make a film he would have instead of writing a book.  I believe, most strongly, in a dapting a book to the screen, one must take the general emotions the book generates, and do everything possible to bring them to the audience.  In Tolkien, these emotions are invariably a sense of joy and wonder, something he certainly instilled with the first volume.  Yet now, it has been a year, and many people (like me) have seen the fellowship so many times we can recite it line by line.  The wonder is no longer new, and the joy somewhat dimmed by our familiarty with the perils of Middle-earth.  In 'The Two Towers', Jackson takes our familiarty, and enhances upon it, bringing us deeper into the characters and the realm of Tolkien's universe.  It's not the same as the book, but it most certainly works.",10,0,0,17 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Peter Jackson has created another masterpiece that surpasses the awe-inspiring Fellowship
","I have just returned from seeing 'The Lord Of The Rings:  The Two Towers', and I am still breathless.  Now, first off let me state that I loved FotR. I saw it five times in the theatre, and believe it to be one of the greatest movies of all times.  For 364 days I have been anxiously awaiting the release of 'The Two Towers', with mixed excitement and apprehension.  I asked myself How could Peter Jackson ever surpass FotR.  Well, Two Towers does just that.  It is, without a doubt, the single most spectacular film I've ever seen.  The battle of Helm's Deep is the most detailed, astounding, and exhilarating fight ever put on film.  Braveheart, Gladiator, Star Wars, Ben-Hur, even The Mines of Moria in Fellowship, can't hold a candle to this. The story is spectacular (I myself chose not to read the first book until i'd seen the movie, and ditto with this one) and from the opening frames, I sat in awe.  I know most of the reviews say so, but I'll just reiterate: The CGI Gollum is one of the best visual effects i've ever seen.  Some of the scenes where we see Smeagol held captive by the dark, manipulative Gollum practically brought tears to my eyes.  I felt so much pity and mixed adoration/fear over this creature.  The criss-crossing storylines were well handled, with not to much time spent in one place, at any one time, and having seen the exhibit here in Toronto, I was thrilled to see the sets of Edoras, Helm's Deep and Isengard on the screen. I have money set aside to see this at least four more times.  One viewing, or two for that matter cannot do this triumph justice.  Peter Jackson is a genius, truly.  Every award this film wins, it deserves.  I was bitterly dissapointed when Fellowship lost to the well-acted, moving, yet highly flawed A Beautiful MInd, but this year I'm prepared for such a shun.  If you haven't seen this movie, get off the computer right now and buy your tickets.  If you liked Fellowship, this film will blow you away.  Fair warning though, if you haven't seen the first chapter, go out and rent it before seeing this movie, you'll be lost without it.  One of the greatest films ever made, and I can't wait another year to see The Return Of The KIng.  When the triloyg is finished, I'm sure it will be the greatest cinematic achievement of all time.",10,0,0,18 December 2002
Schindler's List," The most important movie of all time **** (out of ****)
","The holocaust is one of the most horrific pieces of history we have. Because it occurred so recently, and was on such a massive scale, it is important we understand it.  Schindler's List is Spielberg's finest hour, the greatest film ever made on the holocaust and the most important movie ever made.  Ever single person should be REQUIRED to see this movie.  It shows the depths that humanity can sink to, the horrors of our race, yet Schindler's List is about survival, about compassion, about the saving of souls, the saving of lives.  It is a remarkable film, and a key piece to world history.  The performances are perfect, the direction is superb, and the story is one of the greatest imaginable.",10,9,13,11 September 2003
Amadeus," A true masterpiece of music and madness **** (out of ****)
","Milos Forman's Amadeus is a truly magnificent picture.  A complicated character study, a dynamic blend of fact and fiction, and a dark, daring portrait of the madness that often accompanies genius.  F. Murray Abraham is positively brilliant as the bitter, envious Antonio Salieri, a mediocrity whose jealousy of the musical talent he believes god has bestowed upon Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), thereby forsaking him, leads him into a descent of pure hatred and murderous conspiracy.",10,3,5,25 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," a delightful resurrection of a lost genre
","Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge successfully resurrects the lost genre of musicals.  It blends 1890's setting with music by Elton John, Christina Aguilera etc.  And the result is stunning.  Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman have superb onscreen chemistry.  The scenes are beautifully shot, the surrealistic glimpse of Paris providing an amazing real basis for this tale of forbidden love.  Luhrman has been climbing his way up the musical ladder with Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet, and has succeeded admirably in this grand romantic epic.",8,1,2,19 March 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Reinvented Tarantino
","Kill Bill is nothing short of remarkable.  Nine years after Pulp Fiction, director Quentin Tarantino's fourth film is a wonderful narcotic. Personally, I think Tarantino, though great as a director, is limited in his writing ability.  I know there are many who would disagree, but all three of his films share a general form of dialogue, a sort of hip-70's retro talk that grows old by Jackie Brown.  But in Kill Bill, the dialogue is at a minimum and I couldn't be happier.  Here, Tarantino pays brilliant homage to the chop socky films of Sonny Chiba (here appearing as a master swordmaker) and the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone.  Uma Thurman is flawless in her role.  The fight scenes, in their sheer brutality and obvious choreography, beat the Matrix all to hell.  Limbs fly and fountains of blood follow.  A cool comic interlude allows Tarantino to voice his inner bloodloving child in a series of bloody encounters.  This film is Tarantino's most enjoyable work, and without the dull 70's dialogue, the experience is enriched by the raw force.  Cannot wait for Vol. 2.",Null,0,0,18 October 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Perhaps the single greatest stepping stone from past films into present
","Anyone who watches 2001:  A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick's truly mind-boggling masterpiece, will be driven to incredible frustration if they try to make any sense out of it.  The beauty and glory of this journey into space aswell as the interior of our own minds is still breathtaking today, but even now its true vision eludes us.  Almost everyone has his or her own theories on what the film means, but the fact is, no one really knows.  It is for this very reason that 2001 is a classic to rival all classics, and an important stepping stone from old films to new, where Kubrick takes us on a 2 1/2 hour trip from monkeys, to man, to computers, to monoliths and beyond the infinite.  I absolutely love this movie, and I still have no clue what it means.  In being vague but astoundingly visual in its reality, I think it appeals both to the visual mind, aswell as our subconscious selves.  For those of you who haven't seen it, when you do, DO NOT try to understand Kubrick's vision.  Just sit back for the movie ride of your life!",10,0,2,17 June 2002
A Clockwork Orange," My Favorite Movie Of All Time!
","Stanley Kubrick's dark, ultra-violent and morbidly witty masterpiece is a film that cannot be seen indifferently.  Those who view it fall distinctly into two seperate and opposed attitudes:  Those who think it is nauseatingly sick, and those who love it.  I fall into the latter category.  This is my all time favorite movie.  It is probably one of the most controversial films in history, and certainly Kubrick's most daring.  The entire length of the movie, adapted from Anthony Burgess' dark novel, is unrelentingly violent, horrifying and if you can laugh at those things, you'll love it.  THe story is as fascinating as the main character Alex, dealing with the concept of human choice in a delightfully sadistic way.  But the concept itself is not the only attraction, Alex himself creates a positively delightful love-hate relationship between himself and the viewer.  His napoleanic complex and fascination with his own sense of control is brilliantly portrayed by Malcolm MacDowell.  When released in 1971, this film received an X-Rating, and while it would be less controversial today, it still has enough violence, sex, nudity, rape and sadism to transcend almost all the films punched out by today's ultra-violent, MTV driven culture.  In conclusion, while not a film for everyone, A Clockwork ORange is an undisputed masterpiece with an everlasting appeal for those of use who can laugh at 'a bit of the ole' ultra-violence.'",10,1,2,25 June 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Amazing action, horrific writing
","The Matrix Reloaded has powerful pros and powerful cons. Its difficult to say which outweighs the other. The action is unbelievable, some of the best action sequences ever put on film. The story is decent, with a nice series of twists and complications. The dialogue (and for the most part the actors who are forced to speak it) are horrible. And ultimately, the movie is highly condescending. The philosophy of the first Matrix was imbued in the essence of the story. It was not only one of the best action films ever made (a totally revolutionary one, at that), but it was also intelligent and original. It got the viewers thinking, and had numerous great philosophic one liners (You think that's air you're breathing? There is no spoon.) Four years later, the Wachowski brothers have decided you're not smart enough to think for yourself, so they'll turn those one-liners into condescending lectures about determinism and free will, about the nature of the human and predestination, all of which sound like class notes taken from first year philosophy. Then, they'll make their characters deliver these pointless speeches in pointless scenes that pointlessly take up time. The conversation between the Merovingian and our heroes is absolutely unbearable, and unwatchable. Given the material, its not surprising that the acting in this film is below the standard of the first one. Keanu Reeves can't act, but he doesn't have to, so it doesn't really matter. Carrie Anne-Moss is decent, as are some of the new additions (Link, Niobe, Seraph). What is most disappointing here, however, is the degeneration of Morpheus. In the original Matrix, Laurence Fishburne gave us a kung-fu-fighting, gunslinging, building-jumping sage, a man of wisdom. In Reloaded, Morpheus is more robotic than the machines they're fighting. He is the one that has to deliver most of this philosophical garbage, and even though Fishburne is a great actor, I don't think anyone could make this sound like anything other than what it really is: the condescending claptrap of two ex-philosophy students, stroking their egos. In fact, the only time we get a glimpse of the old Morpheus is during his fight sequences. As for these, well, they're the movie's redemption. They fly past the first Matrix, and crush almost all other action sequences in recent memory. The Brawl sequence, in which Neo confronts the 100 Smiths (his duplication trick is the best addition to the story) will leave your heart pounding. One thing the Wachowski's have succeeded in is pushing the bar for action films again. The real highlight (worth watching the movie for in itself) is the Freeway Chase, a scene that is beyond any doubt the best chase in film history, with ghosts, agents, cars, motorcycles, trucks and battles on top of trucks, crashes, explosions, bullet-time shots, and Morpheus with a samurai sword: in Neo's words, 'Whoa.' Another great improvement is the development of Smith from a cold-blooded agent, to a power-hungry, duplicating opposite of Neo. Hugo Weaving is the only actor in the film that comes out ahead. Here, he plays a Smith who, so coldly evil and emotionless in the first film, is now devilishly evil with a sense of twisted humour, (The great thing about being me is there's so many me's; if you can't beat us, join us; me, me, me. Me too!). He overplays the part with a vigor that seems to be lacking in every other character in the film, and is one of the only people who doesn't seem like a machine.",7,0,1,2 February 2006
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful 'fiction' *** (out of ****)
","A Beautiful Mind is marketed as a story 'Based on events in the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr.'.  Nowadays, however, based on is a fairly loose term.  The sheer number of factual errors and liberties taken with the life of the schizophrenic mathematician are too many to count, so perhaps it is best to think of this film as a fiction.  That said, this otherwise mediocre movie is elevated to an extreme degree by Russell Crowe's brilliant performance. As John Nash, Crowe is nothing short of astounding.  He single handedly redeems the film, and raises it past the level of mediocrity.  In truth, this film won four academy awards it should not have (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress), and lost the one award for which it should have been a shoo-in (Best Actor).  Is there no justice?",8,0,1,27 December 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Russell Crowe's performance is nothing short of marvelous
","I must admit, I went into A Beautiful Mind not expecting much.  It had received lukewarm reviews and I, at the time, was not really in the mood for another feel good triumph of the human spirit movie.  But I came out most pleasantly suprised. For the past little while, I've had a love-hate relationship with this movie.  I liked it, and thought it a very mature film by Ron Howard, yet I feel it was a sycophantic attemtpt to draw attention at the academy awards, attention that I feel should have rightly gone to The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. Now, to say off the bat, Russell Crowe's performance is nothing short of marvelous.  I don't particularly care for him, but I can certainly respect his brilliant portrayal of the schizophrenic mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr.  While Howard glosses over the more displeasing character traits of Nash a la The Hurricane, traits which include alleged Anti-Semitism, it's not his movie.  Crowe owns the screen, and, being in virtually every scene, he elevates what could have been a tale of a man's struggle with a severe mental illness he can't deal with, and the people that stuck with him, into something that, while not approaching art, is heart-wrenching, with a predictable, but nonetheless welcomed happy ending.  I find it difficult to understand how this film earned Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, yet failed to garner one for the man who made the effort worthwhile.  Yet, Hollywood loves mental illness.  From Forrest Gump, to Rain Man, to Charly, films about heart over mind seem to never get old with the judges at the Oscars. I feel that this is as good a film as could have been made about this character, almost entirely due to Crowe, without becoming distant to the viewer.  Do we really want to know about Nash's Anti-Semitism?  Not really, no.  A Beautiful Mind will always appear to me a film that made a campaign at the academy awards, and robbed a far superior film of it's honor.  But it's definitely worth seeing.",8,0,1,26 May 2002
The Green Mile," It's not perfect, but powerful performances and a stirring story make this a supremely moving motion picture ***1/2 (out of ****)
","The first time I read Stephen King's The Green Mile, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  But it is only now, three years later, having just read it a second time, that I realize how brilliant a story it is.  This is perhaps King's best book, and oddly enough, its a departure from his genre.  Frank Darabont, who adapted King's novella Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption into one of the greatest movies ever made, has remained incredibly faithful to the book, and in a way, that's both a curse and a blessing.  The Green Mile does not duplicate the success that Darabont had with Shawshank, but we must remember that such a film as the latter only comes along once in a generation.  Still, this dark parable is incredibly well-realized, with most of the heart-wrenching emotion of the book still intact, thanks to exceptional performances given by all, especially MIchael Clarke Duncan, whose portrayal of the simple-minded miracle of nature John Coffey truly deserved an oscar (this was the ONLY film I have ever cried at the end of).",9,0,2,11 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Revenge of George Lucas
","The third time's the charm. In his final Star Wars film, George Lucas redeems himself completely for his failures in Episode I and II. Revenge of the Sith is a film worthy to stand alongside the original trilogy. It is, in fact, perhaps the best of all (though I still consider Empire STrikes Back for this position). This is the one fans have been waiting for: the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader; his turn to the Dark Side; his duel with Obi-Wan; and the overthrow of the Galactic Republic, and the destruction of the Jedi. This is by far the darkest Star Wars movie. All the juvenile caterings of the previous two prequels are gone, and the film might actually be the first Star Wars movie unsuitable for younger children. I think this is the story George Lucas has been wanting to tell all along. His previous two prequels, notable only for their level of mediocrity and digital windowdressing, are, in retrospect, nothing more than the motions needed to get to this point. It seems to me that George Lucas (the creative genius George Lucas, that is), must have been asleep for the previous two, using them as the means to an end. And what an end! To start off with, Episode III is probably the best written of any of the Star Wars films. It is also the best acted. Hayden Christiansen, whose performance in Episode II carried all the weight and charm of a wooden stick, is born anew in this film. Previously, it seemed impossible that this teen hearthrob could become the menacing Darth Vader. But, sporting longer hair and a badboy scar, Christiansen carries it off admirably. Also notable for her transformation is Natalie Portman. In the last film, their love affair was completely unbelievable, their chemistry zero, and their dialogue embarrassingly bad. This time round, it works. Portman gives an excellent portrayal of the tragic character Padme, forced to watch the man she loves transformed into a monster. Ewan MacGregor, the only actor who actually acted in the previous two films, once again takes the prize for best performance. His chemistry with Christiansen, already good in Episode II, is superb, giving real depth to the relationship. The most remarkable element of the film's writing may be the actual manner in which Skywalker is turned to the Dark Side, which is completely believable. There is a certain morbid satisfaction in seeing the bad guys win for once, too. Anakin's journey down the dark path is conditioned, on one hand by his love of Padme and his fear of losing her, and on the other by his distrust of the Jedi, and his anger towards them. The final factor is the seduction of the chancellor Palpatine, later to become the GAlactic Emperor, who uses Anakin's feelings of fear and anger to transform him into a Sith Lord. In Return of the Jedi, the Emperor Palpatine was a truly great villain, a true vision of evil. Twenty years later, Ian McDiarmid darns the cloak once again. To me, he is one of the greatest strongpoints of Episode III. Though he has been in the previous films as chancellor, and as the hidden Darth Sidious, it is here that he reveals himself as a force of pure evil, performing a brilliant coup-de-grace on the Jedi, seducing Anakin with an almost Hannibal Lecter-like power of psychology and language, and, for the first time, showing his real power as a Sith Lord in two memorable battles against Mace Windu and Yoda. The action in this film is top-notch, from the epic opening rescue mission, to the apocalyptic final duel. As special treats, we get a four lightsaber wielding Jedi droid, Wookiee warfare and the introduction of Chewbacca, and, for those fans who loved Yoda's lightsaber fight in Episode II, an epic duel between Yoda and the Emperor himself, featuring lightsabers, acrobatics, lightning and all. The special effects are not nearly as good as something as say, Lord of the Rings, but the movie's action sequences are too much fun to care. As the grand finale, we get the battle that all Star Wars fans have been waiting for: the Battle of the Heroes between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader over pits of lava. This final duel, which is intercut with the Darth Sidious vs. Yoda duel, is the best there has ever been. Legendary among Star Wars fans, it is truly something to behold. Finally, Episode III ends with the birth of Luke and Leia, the rebirth of a disfigured Anakin into the masked Darth Vader, the beginning of the construction of the Death Star, and the delivery of Luke to Tatooine, linking two trilogies together, and completing the Star Wars legacy, a legacy more alive in this film than it has been since the original trilogy, and proof of Lucas' genius as a filmmaker.",10,0,2,26 August 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Number two? Fine by me **** (out of ****)
","I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time.  That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out.  Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this.  Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance.  If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.",10,3,5,11 September 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," In time, this masterpiece may be considered the greatest movie ever made
","The Shawshank Redemption is not only the greatest film of the last decade, but in time, this may become, in the eyes of moviegoers, the best movie ever made.  The story of wrongfully accussed banker Andy Dufresne, and his friendship formed with con Ellis Boyd Redding in Shawshank Prison, has become as universally acclaimed and loved as any other in recent history. This is the 'Casablanca' of it's time.  A near-perfect movie that can be watched hundreds of times and never lose it's impact.  Perhaps its the way the movie handles the timeless theme of hope, and the trials one man has to endure to be attain the proverbial redemption of the title.  Maybe it is because this movie is truth, simple truth, about the triumph of good over evil, the triumph of reason over madness, the triumph of hope over everything.",10,0,0,11 January 2003
Amélie," Le mot juste ***1/2 (out of ****)
","With Amelie, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, a director best known in North America for the fourth film in the Alien Legacy, Alien Ressurection, truly comes into his own with this veritable masterwork of delightful characters, circumstances and of course, the beautiful Montmatre back drop.  Audrey Tautou is delightful as the shy, but astoundingly charming Amelie Poulain, a woman who changes the lives of those around her.  Some cynics or people with a particular distaste for French cinema will probably not like this, but otherwise this is a movie well worth your time.",10,0,2,25 December 2002
Final Destination," A good idea sucked dry by a predictable plot.
","When I first heard about Final Destination, I found the premise intriguing. Death stalking it's victims, unseen terror.  I actually saw it hoping that it would be an elevation above the teen horror flick genre.  Hope as I might, the burst into flames as quickly as the plane that sets up this cliche ridden, badly written, and horribly acted film.  Alex Browning is journeying with his classmates on a year end trip to Paris.  The movie opens admirably, despite several predictable moments (Alex's father saying 'Live it up, you've got the rest of your life ahead of you', when thunder suddenly booms in the background and ominous notes take over.  We are introduced to all the key characters at the airport, several creepy, morbid kids who would benefit from psychological counselling.  Anyway, as Alex boards the plane, he falls asleep and is struck by a extremely vivid (and frightening) vision of the plan exploding.  When he causes a ruckus, Alex and several other members of his class are forced off.  Upon takeoff, guess what happens. The plane explodes, leaving the seven survivors to mourn for the two-hundred and eighty killed.  Now the idiocy begins.  Toilet water chases people through their houses, knives fly, kitchens explode, small sheet metal becomes deadly, decapitating flying blades.  James Wong, who did several X-Files episodes, obviously hoped to capitalize on this original idea of seven people who have cheated death, and have angered the cosmic existance.  But he is a rookie, and, though their is no boogeyman, the deaths of several expendable students are completely cliched.  The acting is forced, Devon Sawa and Ali Larter prove incapable of evoking sympathy, and Tony Todd as the death-obsessed mortician, is almost painful to watch.  However, challenging the acting for the statuette of 'pointless endeavour' is the writing.  Idiotic sick jokes fall flat, mindless murders grow tedious, and embarassingly bad lines pervade this film.  The stupid psychobabble makes the story seem incredibly corny, while an abyssmal ending, attempting black comedy, mares any chance of redemption.  A good outline for movie, but nothing more.  Maybe in a few years a more qualified director will produce the premise more seriously.",3,2,3,17 February 2002
Ran," The Greatest Shakespearian Adaptation of All Time, and the Crown Jewel of Akira Kurosawa's Career
","Of all Shakespeare's plays, none excels King Lear. Whilst Hamlet is the true masterpiece of language and poetry, Lear has a true human story unlike anything else in the Bard's writings. And here is the only film adaptation to do this great work justice, a Japanese film by master director Akira Kurosawa. This is the pinnacle of Kurosawa's career. It is a work that directly captures the tragedy of Shakespeare, and is final proof that Kurosawa was unequaled when it came to blending Eastern and Western styles. The story of Lear is transmuted into the story of Lord Ichimonji, who foolishly draws his flattering sons near him, whilst banishing the only one to speak the truth. What ensues is the chaos (Ran) of war, as a clan that Ichimonji built out of blood and death erupts in a power struggle. Ichimonji is the perfect version of Lear, considered by most Shakespearian actors as the hardest and most noteworthy role to play. Here are preserved all the classic elements: the loyalty of the third son (Saburo/Cordelia) in the face of insurmountable treachery, the crazy old man (Ichimonji/Lear) and the wise fool that follows him. Other elements are added, such as the Lady Macbeth like Lady Kaede, whose hatred fuels the ravages of war, the gentle Lady Sue and her blind brother Tsurumaru, both victims of Ichimonji's former wrath. In this film, Kurosawa gives birth to the brilliant vision that is worthy of King Lear. Its imagery is unmatched, and certain scenes, such as the Siege of the First Castle, are remarkable for their savagery, poetry, and tragedy. The final Battle of the Four Armies is unsurpassed in film. For people familiar with the techniques of Sun-tzu, this offers a fascinating glimpse of his strategy in action, with much more depth and planning than the bloodfests in Braveheart or Gladiator. And though the Seven Samurai is still his greatest work, Ran stands as Kurosawa's most complete masterpiece, an epic, a tragedy, and a truly masterful film that shows the vicious circle of destruction that arises out of war and ambition.",10,4,10,15 February 2006
Gangs of New York," A Magnificent Failure
","Watching Gangs of New York is sort of like witnessing a beautiful ship sink under its own weight. The film is, in my opinion, ultimately a failure, but it is a spectacular failure. It feels incomplete, crude, almost a prototype of a masterpiece. Martin Scorsese continues to move away from his gritty roots toward the artistic and the epic, a field that he in which he has already proved himself with the beautiful masterpiece Kundun. Gangs of New York is a story of vengeance, set against the backdrop of the 1860s New YOrk, a city divided into tribes at war. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a surprisingly decent performance as the young Amsterdam Vallon, whose father, the 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson, in a great cameo), was killed in an epic battle between the IRish immigrants and the 'Natives' by William Cutting, 'Bill the Butcher.' DiCaprio proves that he can indeed act beyond the range of the Titanic sweetheart, and gives impetus for his superior role in The Aviator. The acting honours of this film, however, go to Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill. This is Lewis' best performance yet, and in this film he stands as a Titan amongst minnows, and creates a character so complex and fascinating that one cannot help but think this film is unworthy of him. Bill is a born killer, who uses his butcher knives and knowledge of anatomy to stike down his enemies in single blows. The film is pretty much divided into two acts: the first is brilliant, the second is a disaster. In the first, we have a story of vengeance and valour. Perhaps Bill's most fascinating quality is his similarity to the knights of old. He and his enemy, Priest Vallon, were both men of warrior character, two similar natures placed on opposites sides of the battlefield. The respect that Bill renders to the memory of Priest Vallon as the only great warrior he ever knew, a respect and amity free of hatred now that his foe is vanquished, forestalls Amsterdam's ideas of revenge. Amsterdam finds himself drawn to the man who killed his father, recognizing in him the same great character of his father. He ultimately is protected under the wings of the dragon, and is driven near madness by the affection which he feels coupled with hatred. The second act begins after Amsterdam reveals his real nature, and is set up against the Butcher. From here on, the film degenerates into a typical story of war. Though this is weak, its promise of an apocalyptic war between the two factions keeps the tension high. It is utterly inexcusable that Scorsese robs us of this final pleasure, substituting a violent riot that extinguishes all the momentum of the last two hours, and leaves the final fight between Amsterdam and the Butcher awkward and unsatisfying. Ultimately, this is a film worth seeing, and one cannot help but lament the failure of the masterpiece that could have been.",6,0,1,4 March 2006
