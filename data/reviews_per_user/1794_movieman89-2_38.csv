Angels & Demons," Kept me hooked to the screen
","I very much enjoyed the first movie. I heard very good things about the book on this one. I saw trailers for the film and thought 'that looks really cool'. I went to see it and really enjoyed it.The filming was excellent by Ron Howard, some really good landscape shots. The story was really and intense and very interesting. There a lot of twists and turn everywhere. All the acting performances were again very good.To be honest I thought it was better than Davinci Code. It is a lot more exciting, action packed and faster paced.If you enjoyed Davinci Code, I reckon you will really like this one",8,1,4,31 May 2009
Alien 3," The scariest one in the Quadrilogy
","In my opinion, this is my second best of the Alien films. The second is my favourite.I think they did a great job with this. Brilliant direction by David Fincher and good story. It also really does connect you with the characters, even though they are criminals, you still feel for them.This is a good follow on from the second. Some bits may be a bit slow, but when it gets to the alien scenes, the suspense kicks in. Again great cast and Weaver again does a great job of Ripley.I love the way it shows filming from the alien's eye when chasing the victims, great idea. I really like the lighting (brown and gold together)because it shows how dirty the whole of Fury 161 is. It also shows a lot of shadow which is good to create suspense.I think this is the most tense and scariest in the series because we see the alien run and attack so fast that you feel you have got no escape. We see for the first time, this one has four legs.Some people think this is the worst one, but I think its definitely worth watching.",8,2,53,23 November 2008
It," 10- 12 years worth the wait
","I still remember this day reading the book when I was 15 or 16. I simply could not put the book down. I felt and still feel that way with all of King's novels, I'm a huge fan. After finishing IT, I was desperate to watch the original film. When I watched it, I was very disappointed. For me, it didn't live up to the book whatsoever. Now, at the age of 27, I re watched parts of the original and it still has the same effect on me. I felt the acting was awful and the screenplay was poorly written and cheesy. IT is not a cheesy story.Last year, I heard that it was being remade into a two part feature film. Usually when I hear about a new remake to a classic my instant reaction is 'What? Why? Its awesome, it doesn't need remaking'. But with this remake, I thought 'Oh good, I hope this one is an improvement'. With IT being remade in two parts, I loved the idea because I felt that it would give writers a chance to keep as close to the book as possible. I've been keeping up to date with the news about it and the hype and to be honest I joined in the hype, I was so excited for it. I went to see it last night, and let me just say to begin with,if there was an opportunity to stand up and cheer at the end credits,I would of done that.I was instantly hooked to the film as soon as it started, the beginning scene is near enough identical to the book. The rest of the story kept extremely close to the book but there were a lot of new additions to it. The new additions were superb. When I was watching it I thought 'Ah that didn't happen like in the book, but wow this new part is awesome!!' For the scares, they were simply spine tingling. Every single scare was meaningful, none of them felt obnoxious, repetitive or unnecessary. Even the added CGI felt right and actually looked stunning.The characters kept very strong like they did in the book. You felt for every single one of them. Like King does, he makes you love the ones you're supposed to love and despise the ones you were supposed to hate. It had a huge Stand by Me feel which was fantastic. The actors of The Loosers Club were absolutely amazing. Especially Jaeden Lieberher and Sophia Lillis. I really hope they will keep their acting careers going.Now for Bill Skarsg√•rd as the evil, twisted Pennywise the Dancing Clown. He was astonishing. Every time he came on screen, I felt a shiver. He was exactly as I imagined the book. There was no cheesiness to him, there was just simply dread and terror. And for Nicholas Hamilton as the insane bully Henry Bowers, he was fantastic. He acted so well as an insane wild animal. He cohorts Belch and Chris were also great. I'm also so happy the character Patrick Hockstetter was put into the film, even though his screen time was quite short it was still good that he was put in.Like the book, the screenplay was written beautifully with perfect pace for the story and a lot of very funny lines included to lighten the mood at appropriate times. The only little complaint I would add is that I thought the character Mike Hanlon deserved a little bit more screen time but it didn't ruin the film for me.The cinematography, lighting and set design were stunning. The attention to detail in every part of the frame was excellent. And of course a big round of applause to Andy Muschietti for brilliant directing.This film has become one of my favourite Stephen King adaptations. I've waited for 10 or 12 years for a decent adaptation of IT and it was worth the wait. Absolutely incredible!! I'm so exited for the next chapter and I heard that Muschietti is directing it which is an amazing step forward.",10,9,20,9 September 2017
Iron Man 2," No offence to people who like the comic, but to me it was a disappointment
","I have seen the first Iron Man and rather enjoyed it. I did hear they made this one and saw the trailer. I must say, trailers are very deceiving.The story started off OK, but then we saw the main villain (Roark, who didn't have much dialogue through out the movie). We sort of knew why he was being the villain, but we didn't know anything else about him.The action scenes just ended way too quickly and the rest of the film seemed it was just about Stark acting like an arrogant prat, which I thought got very slow.The acting performances were pretty good, but Scarlett Johansen performance just kept saying to me 'look how beautiful I am'. But the rest of the cast did well.There is also this big commotion about the ACDC soundtrack released, I only counted 1 or 2 songs played in the film, that was it. They didn't even play Black Sabbath's Iron Man at all, which I thought was annoying because it's a great song.All in all, it was average and nowhere near as good as the first movie. I did hear people liked this because of the comic, so to the people who liked it, I'm sorry if being a bit too strong.",4,1,5,21 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Great but not as good as the others
","This is the least best in the Alien series.Got a pretty good story and good cast, but if you think about it, it goes over the top. It really should of ended at 3 because Ripley dies and you think 'ok thats that'.How can they clone Ripley after two hundred years, and bring back the alien she carried.Cool action and suspense, but shows too much of the aliens which didn't really feel tense. Definitely the goriest one in the series. In the others, you really don't see too much of the aliens which made great tension.Also making the alien half human, its pretty cool but still over the top. Nowhere near as good as the queen.Other than that, its worth watching but not as good as the others",4,2,3,23 November 2008
The Impossible," The most intense drama/disaster film I've ever seen on the big screen
","I remember hearing about the tsunami on the radio on Boxing Day and being shocked about it. Then seeing footage of it on the news, seeing all the terrible damage it caused on people's lives. Before this was released, I read about it in Empire that they were going to make a film about it. My first thoughts were that it was going to hard hitting film. I then saw trailers and felt I had to see it. I went to see it a few days after its official release. What a brilliant film it was.Character development was slightly shaky to begin with because the disaster happened very quickly. But then the rest of the development happens through out their survival. Through out I felt a strong connection with them as the film went on. Even the scenes where the family meet up a 2 or 3 days after the wave hit, I felt a lump down my throat (spoilers excuse me). Near the end when Naimo Watts had to go through surgery, I nearly wanted to shout out 'For gods sake, don't kill her off' The acting from all the cast was fantastic. But the actor that really caught me was Tom Holland, who was sensational. Why he's not nominated for an award, I don't know. I really liked how the director gathered extras who were real survivors from the real tsunami. I felt that they really put a lot of care into this film. Except, I found that the real family this film is based on are Spaniards, not English. I would like to find out why they changed this.The filming and the cinematography was spectacular. This director has done a brilliant job. Another part that caught me was the sound. Now that doesn't happen very often with me with film. When they wave hit, I actually thought I was in the wave with them. Usually, in disaster films, when the action happens, I think 'oh wow that looks amazing'. But since this tragedy actually happened, I thought 'Oh my god'. The sound editing was fantastic. Even through the scenes where characters are walking through the damages, it was deathly silent but you can hear someone, far away in the distance, screaming for help, which was really emotional.Through out most of the film, there is not an inch of cheesiness at all. Only except, at the end, where the main characters get on a plane first class and is going to have first class health care. But this I didn't think lasted too long because the father brings out the piece of paper with names of people that were asked to find by survivors. The same for the eldest son. Also the mother having her name, tattooed on her arm so that the hospital could find her when one of her family members wanted to find her. These are all remaining scars and this made the ending very realistic.Audience at the beginning were very loud and irritating. Someone told them to be quiet. Through the film, there was complete silence, which I rarely hear in cinemas these days.I really recommend this film, please go and see it. This should nominated for more awards. I do hope Naimo Watts wins for best actress in a leading role. This will remain the most intense drama/disaster film I ever seen on the big screen.",8,1,3,13 January 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Great British comedy/horror
","I have watched this film so many times and i still find it absolutely hilarious! It makes me laugh every time.The story was really good and the zombies were excellent and original.The comedy and the characters were fantastic, they did't go over top with cheesiness. I think it shows us typical British people would do in that type of situation.I also thought by watching it many times, you always notice something different every time.I think it really is a grate fun film to watch. Bits of it make you jump.But the rest of it made me laugh out loud and always does.",8,0,1,7 November 2008
127 Hours," Yet again, Danny Boyle hasn't failed
","As soon as I heard about this film and saw it was directed by Boyle, it immediately took my interest. I just recently went to see it and I thought it was excellent.The story is very intriguing, captivating and gritty. Not that much happens but it kept me connected all the way through and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. It especially kept me interested on learning more about the character, Aron.The acting was very good and believable. I have to say the best acting performance was the main character. It was also really good to see Clemence Posse something else from Harry Potter.The filming and editing were fantastic. I loved all the unique angles that were used. The editing I thought was very clever with the way some scenes, where things were happening, you get to see it in three different parts.I love Danny Boyle films, such as 28 Days Later, Shallow Grave, Trainspotting etc. And again, he has done brilliantly. Rock On dude! I really recommend this. Go see it while you still can.",9,0,2,11 January 2011
Terminator Salvation," Are you sure this is Terminator?
","My brother and I are huge Terminator fans. When I saw the trailer for this, I thought I have got to see it.My brother and I just went to the movies to see it last night. To be honest I was quite disappointed.It begins with bucket loads of action with no explanation of what's going on. This is rated 12A in the movies. I really don't think a young child is going understand the story of The Terminator franchise if they haven't seen the first 2 movies, which were awesome. The 3rd wasn't so good. Terminator is really aimed at the older audience.I was impressed with the opening titles, I thought they were very good.Christian Bale I thought did well as John Connor but the rest of the cast was average. The special effects a lot of the times went way over the top, I was thinking OK calm down with the effects.The story wasn't brilliant. With Marcus Wright, it is completely obvious that he is a machine because he signed a contract that has the word SKYNET on it. I can't believe that was a twistThe direction and filming was good, but I wish Cameran did it again. I think this one was more aimed at kids not actual Terminator fans.There were a few goods bits which were good, but they don't really last long. There were quite a lot of ridiculous stunts they you can not survive through, for example Connor is on a helicopter on top of choppy, stormy seas possibly one hundred feet up. He dives off in the sea to get to a sub which is underwater and then cuts to when he's in the sub. Seriously, why did they do that? Overall it was OK, but not really Terminator. It was more like an action that doesn't use any brain cells with the word Terminator in it. Termintor is an action film with an awesome story and uses a lot of brain cells.You can go and see by all means. But I would rather wait till the DVD is out to rent. I think a lot of Terminator fans would be more outraged than I was.",5,1,3,6 June 2009
Alien," Awesome start to sci-fi horror
","This film is a classic shivers down your spine horror.Not really the best in the series but shows a great start to how it all began. Great cast and fantastic suspense.Great direction by Ridley Scott and good cinematography. Great cast and good connectivity with the characters. You don't see much of the alien which makes it even better, because you know its there but you can't see it coming.The first time I saw the chest burst scene, it made may stomach turn, but it was cool and gross. Doesn't really have a lot of action but contains loads of tension. Definitely worth watching, I really liked it.",8,0,1,23 November 2008
28 Weeks Later," A pretty good sequel
","When first hearing about this being released, I was really excited about because I loved the first one. But when reading about the US army coming in, I thought 'oh dear'.But when watching it, I thought it was very good. Good follow up from the first one. Very good story and connection with the new characters. Characters weren't as good as the ones in the first but still good.Excellent cinematography and special effects.Still got really good scare scenes but a lot more graphic than the first.Disappointed ending because its another opening to another sequel. I really hope they make the next one about the cure to the virus.Still a very good film, very worth seeing.",7,1,1,17 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Now Thats Better
","I'm a huge Potter fan. Fan of the books and the films. The Half Blood Prince I was disappointed with because I think it didn't focus on the main point of the story, it just focused on a romantic comedy format (nothing wrong with romantic comedies, but thats not what Potter is all about). So I had low expectations for this film. This was the first Potter film I was quite worried about. I just came back from seeing the film with my family and I have to say Potter fans, you're in for something brilliant here.The acting was much better and it kept very well to the story. It is very much like the book so far. It may not be all in order, but it still tried to keep up with the story. It even finally brings in characters from the books that haven't been in the films yet, which is great.The action scenes were excellent, when the action kicks off, it definitely kicks off.The tension scenes are very gripping and the emotional scenes, you better get tissues.Overall this was excellent, so much better than the last film. Potter fans, enjoy. Can't wait for the second part for next year.",9,0,2,20 November 2010
The Shining," Jack Nicholson, Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King, what a team, what a film!
","If you want to watch a really mind-messing horror, this is for you. This is my number one favourite horror film. Jack Nicholson fitted the part of Jack Torrence extremely well. Atmosphere was extremely tense and raises the tension beautifully.This is also my number one horror novel. There are differences to the book and film, but I really liked the differences. For example, the two Grady girls and the ocean of blood from the elevator. It would have been cool if they added the animal hedges, which was from the book. I understand that they couldn't do it because they did't have the technology available at the time.I also thought the music fitted really well. It was strange and gives you an uncomfortable feeling. What a genius idea for Jack Nicholson to bring one of the most famous quotes of all time, which is 'here's Johnny'.One thing that I was disappointed about was Shelley Duvall, because her character in the book was tough, argumentative and cool. But in the film she came across as was pathetic and rather hysterical which got really annoying!Other than that, I think its an amazing film, I really recommend it. Jack, Stephen and Stanley really make a great team!",9,0,0,7 November 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Arnie's best ever!
","This one is one of my best action films ever. I loved the first one but the second was even better.Edward Furlong was just right for the character and has a great continium from the first.Excellent script, superb special effects and great action. First it begun with 'I'll be back' and now its 'Hasta La Vista Baby', how awesome is that.I watched it lots of times and Im still not tired of it. James Cameran and Arnie did it again.This is definitely for you if you are an action fan.Also if you are a Guns and Roses fan, 'You could be mine' is in it, just to let you know.",9,2,3,11 November 2008
Aliens," The best in the Quadrilogy
","This is definitely one of the best sequels. Definitely worth watching. You have just seen the horror in the first, Now you are going to see horror and action.Weaver delivers a great performance as Ripley again and also includes a great cast. Great special effects, action, suspense.Fantastic filming and editing.The aliens in this are awesome. Also this is the first time you get to see the big momma that runs the show, The Queen, which is excellent.The queen vs Ripley is the best fight scene in the film, always keeps you on the edge of your seat.This certainly is the best in the Alien Quadrilogy. Please watch it if you are a horror and action.I salute James Cameran for this film. Great job",9,1,4,23 November 2008
Saw III," Kind of lost it's touch
","After watching the first two films, I thought I have definitely got to watch this one. Afterwords I was quite disappointed.The story was pretty good, but with Jigsaw and Amanda, the rules have changed because he is not really a killer, he gives the victim the choice. But with this it feels like it's saying yeah he is a killer and is saying you have no choice, you die anyway.Good connection with the characters and pretty good acting.The gore scenes I think got way too much, even I felt I had to look away from the screen a few times.Disappointingly the traps were kind of ridiculous and over the top as the film goes. I kept thinking how could only two people make a trap bigger than a tank, you need loads of people for that.The twist was average and left loads of unanswered questions.Watch this by all means, but I really think it should of ended at Saw 2.",6,0,0,15 April 2009
The Conjuring 2," Wow!! Literally one of the best horror sequels I've seen!!
","Since I'm a huge fan of the first film, reading about it in Empire and seeing the trailers, I felt the need to see it. I saw it at my local cinema last night and my first word for it is 'Wow!!'The story was powerful with plenty of investment in the characters. It literally kept me hooked through out start to finish. The structure worked brilliantly for the scares and dramatic moments. There was plenty of focus on both. (Spoiler alert) I did notice that Wan has used an idea or two from Insidious, with Lorraine entering the void to communicate with the dead in her visions. But yet, it still worksAt some points, it literally made my spine shiver. The scares were very effective. Although (a spoiler coming, be warned) the image of The Crooked Man, I thought, looked a bit silly. But it doesn't ruin the film.The acting was fantastic, especially from Madison Wolfe who played Janet. I really hope her career progresses. And of course, the acting was brilliant from everyone else.Now for the cinematography and lighting, they were just amazing. They were an added bonus on making the film work even more. My favourite angle in particular was in the scene involving Ed, talking to the spirit of Bill Wilkins. The camera does not leave them and it focuses on Ed with the spirit in the background, which is blurred, with very little detail. I'de have to say, that was one of the best camera techniques I've seen on film.So overall, the film was absolutely incredible. James Wan, Carey and Chad Hayes, I give the devil/rock on horns to you guys. Horror fans, you're in for an incredible treat.",9,1,4,15 June 2016
Quantum of Solace," This is not James Bond
","I went to see this the other night and I have to say I was extremely disappointed.The editing was terrible. The fight scenes went so quick that you couldn't tell who was fighting who. The film went too quick for a story.There was no connectivity with the characters, no gadgets, well there was but with no explanation of the gadget.The theme song sounded like my cat going to the vets (screeching.If you are a James Bond fan, You would feel the same way I did when I saw it.",2,6,9,17 November 2008
Insidious," James Wann and Oren Peli make a great team
","I first of all saw the trailer of this at the movies when seeing another movie. The trailer definitely caught my attention. But then I saw it was by the makers of the first Saw and Paranormal Activity (which I'm a huge fan of both of those films) and thought this I definitely got to see.I went to see it and came out extremely impressed.The story was original and captivating. It has mix of Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity. I was nearly disappointed when the story mentioned about possession because it has been used so many times. But when I found it's more than that with the boy's ability, it immediately grabbed me.Very interesting use of lighting effects which made the scenes even more tense.The acting was great and very convincing and made it easier to connect well with the characters.The soundtrack really gave me the creeps. It even freaked me out on the opening titles. Even during when the scare scenes built up more and more, I even tried to find a way to break the silence by moving in my chair or even making a slight cough.Through out this film, you really had to look all over the settings when the scare scenes because you just notice things nearly at the last minute, like it did with Paranormal.The special effects were great. There wasn't much but it use appropriately when it was needed For horror fans like me, this is definitely for you. Trust me, you won't be wasting you're money.",8,3,7,12 May 2011
2012," Great fun, especially on the big screen
","I went to see this not long after it came out. I saw the trailer and thought it looked really good. Also I found out it's by Emmerich, so I thought I've got to see it. After seeing it thought it was plain good fun.The story is interesting and still keeps you connected. A bit of a slow start, but it does kick in soon.To be honest I thought it lacked character connectivity.There was a few scenes which I thought was very cheesy and a bit daft. They should of cut down the car jumping scenes. Also they shouldn't have put in the large plain taking off at the last minute scene.Overall, its good film for excellent special effects and action. I wouldn't say it was as good as The Day after Tomorrow but still a good watch if you like disaster movies.",8,0,0,27 November 2009
Evil Dead," Possibly the worst horror remake I've ever seen. I bow my head down in shame
","When I first read in Empire that The Evil Dead was going to be remade I thought 'Oh for god's sake, why bother remake an absolute classic?'. I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy. If you haven't seen them, I highly recommend you see them. I absolutely love them. I then heard that Raimi and Campbell were involved so I thought that was a bit of a step up.Saw the trailers and then was set in two minds, both saying yes and no. So my curiosity got the better of me and I saw it. I literally bowed my head down in shame and was outraged of how bad this was.The story of course is great cause of the original but how it was portrayed just laughable. OK, the beginning scene was OK and it had potential of being an average remake. It also had some character development which was nice to see at first and the acting actually wasn't bad. But then the disaster began.The script writing went down the drain of when we see how ridiculously stupid the characters were. Through out the situations where one of the characters was possessed and was going to attack, what did the survivors do? Cowered down like utter sissies and put their arms up to protect themselves. Surely you would try and run away or even attack back? Also, when the Mya was back to normal (somehow? who knows it was never explained) she was running away from a car that was about to fall on her, what does she do? she turns round to look, now surely you would keep running. This at the end just got ridiculously annoying. The worst was the fact that as the main character was about to burn the cabin down with his possessed sister in the basement, he stops and says he couldn't do it cause she was singing a lullaby that their mother used to sing to them. He opens up the basement and goes down to see her. Why?!. Also when he buries her alive, he then decides to dig out again and try and bring her back to life, using a heart resuscitator that he somehow created. How do these characters live while they are so stupid? I do not know. I just couldn't wait for them to die to be honest.There were also some very unnecessary visuals that was just thrown in just to make the film more visual. One was when through out the tree rape scene (which I thought was much more shocking in the original) there was a vision of the girl who was possessed at the beginning, throwing up blood. Also we see her again of when Mya was having a shower we see her again. Also we see of when we see another character washing her self, her reflection is of herself as a horrific demon. Seriously enough visuals, leave some of it to the imagination.The end, the beginning scene was never explained. Also when the cabin was in flames, the book of the dead somehow got out the cabin and ended up on the floor. What? At the end I just prayed for the movie to be finished as soon as possible.I cannot believe how bad this movie was. If I was Sam Raimi (who I'm a huge fan of) and looked at the script, I would of felt offended and asked what are you doing to my movie. I think Raimi and Campbell were just so desperate to get back to the times where the made the original cause they felt they had such a good time making it, by remaking it.Please do not bother with this awful waste of film reel. If you've seen the original, please stick with the original. If you've seen this and loved it, hey everyone's different, like it by all means.",2,35,69,30 April 2013
Clash of the Titans," Good entertainment other than that, not that good
","I just recently went to see this film with my family and girlfriend. It was right up my little brothers street and he loved it. But for the rest of us, lets say weren't as enthused as he was.The story was OK but it left quite a few unanswered questions, for example why was everyone against the gods.The special effects were pretty good, especially the Kraken.Sam Worthington, oh dear, he was pretty bad. All he did most of the times was pose, which just got annoying at the end. My girlfriend and I ended up making fun of him, she even called him the male version of Megan Fox, which I thought was a good point. The other performances were average.I did read a comment of this and it said don't expect much for this, I would have to say the same thing.Go and see by all means. This is basically good for just action",5,4,7,9 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," Makes your imagination darker and scarier than it actually is
","I kept on hearing mixed reviews on this movie and it always intrigued me. I went to see this with a friend and we left the movies breathless, but for me, breathless and very impressed.The story is very interesting and keeps you involved.You really get involved with the couple, you either get annoyed or you really want to save them.The acting is very good and believable. The only character that I really don't like is Meica because he acts like he doesn't care and acts hard and tough which I think gets really annoying at times.The scare scenes were fantastic, you even ending up dreading the next night. There are not a lot of special effects but the effects the film use are amazing. They are the sort of effects that makes you imagine in the darkest way.This is not a movie with loads of special effects that jump out you. You really have to look all around the setting witch is a great thing.For horror fans, you should definitely go and see it. But I would advise that you should leave watching this film for a long time after watching it for the first time, so that you don't remember it as much.",8,0,1,11 January 2010
The Dark Knight," Truly Awesome
","This is the Batman film. Absolutely fantastic. Chris Nolan knows what he is doing.I have to say there is nothing wrong with this. No cheesy moments, no terrible acting, all awesome.Christian Bale fits as Batman fantastic. Heath Ledger is amazing as the evil, slimy Joker. Jack Nicholson was good as being funny, jumpy and joyful. But this is how it should be done, showing the joker's true colours, slimy,evil and scary.Everything in this film shows how Batman really is.Chris, you did a great job. Cast, you did a great job. I salute you all.Batman fans, you got to see this",9,4,9,17 November 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi is Back!
","I read in Empire that Sam Raimi was making another horror film. I recently back then watched Evil Dead 1 and 2 and I thought 'I've got to see this'.I just went to see it. Wow he is definitely back. The story is good classic horror dealing with evil. The acting was good and connection with characters was very easy to follow.The filming and direction were really good, some really good slanted angles in a few scenes.The suspense and the scare scenes were excellent. They were really in your face and my insides were clutching and jumping. The sound was one of the best things, which makes you feel like you are there.If you are a hardcore horror fan, this is right up your street. I would recommend seeing The Evil Dead films first, so you can see how Raimi started with horror at the beginning.I am definitely going to the movies to see it again. I have a feeling you won't be disappointed",8,0,2,31 May 2009
Saw," Awesome horror film
","First time seeing this, I was hooked to the screen and was terrified.The story is extremely clever and the characters are really connective. This movie has got a few nasty gore scenes but not a lot which is a good thing because it doesn't need it.The traps are gross but cleverly done. If I was in that situation, I wouldn't know what to do.This is my number three favourite horror film. I highly recommend it. Its got great scares and makes you jump out your seat a few places.The twist is awesome, I won't ruin it but if you are a horror fan, this is definitely for you",9,0,1,15 April 2009
Sinister," Wow! This actually scared me!
","I first of all did see trailers and they looked very convincing. So I went to see it with a couple of friends last night. Let me just say, you're in for something awesome. I came out really excited and actually terrified.The story is original and very clever. Yes, we have the stereotype family move into a new home and things go wrong, but hey that's not really a bad thing. As the story goes on, you get more and more hooked to it. You find out something new each time. The tension is built beautifully. It has a very slow and uncomfortable pace. People may think it could be boring, but trust me, it isn't at all. Its not full of in your face jumps all the time, like many horror films today. The jumps happen and they stay with you to make your flesh crawl. As the twists come up, its even better. All questions are answered in a great way. The story also focuses on how obsessive the main character gets. You get a feeling that he is changing each time, which is another great thing. The acting was very good. Everybody did a great job. Ethan Hawke especially.There isn't much CGI in this film (yippee!) but when it is used, its used appropriately and subtly. What also really worked was the soundtrack. Its not stereotypically high pitched or, you know, you're usual music you use. The composer uses tunes and base notes to make it very uncomfortable in a strange way. I even shuffled in my seat a couple of times and it generally scared me. This really works for the film. Well done Christopher Young, you did great. I'm a huge horror fan and it can take a lot to actually scare me. But this one actually scared me, which I was not expecting for these days standards.Horror fans, I really recommend this for you. Please go and see it. You're money will be well spent.",8,2,4,13 October 2012
Les Mis√©rables," Absolutely incredible. The film of the year
","I first heard they were making this by my aunt. I remember that my younger brother and I stayed with her. Her and her partner took us out to London and took us to Greenwich University where her partner worked. They took us down cause this was being filmed there for a few scenes just outside in the courtyard. We even saw a few takes being done and what an amazing experience it was seeing this happen. My hopes of the future is to be in the movie business. This has been for my whole life.Months later I saw the trailer and there it captured me immediately. My family and I saw it a few days after its release. Our minds were all just blown away from how brilliant it was.The story was captivating and compelling. I never actually read the book, seen the stage show or any of the other movie adaptations. So this was all brand new to me.The acting was astonishing and the character development was fantastic. I love the fact that they actually sang on set, not added in post production. Everyone of the cast's singing voices were amazing. There was not one voice that I didn't like. Hugh Jackman was the star of the show, my family and I are so disappointing that he didn't win the best actor award in at The Academy Awards. He deserved it. But I am so happy that Anne Hathaway won the Supporting Actress award. Her acting was brilliant and when she sang, my mouth gaped open and had goosebumps all over me. Even Russel Crow surprised me of how well he sang as well. My family and I now own the soundtrack of the movie and have the Blu Ray copy pre ordered. The cinematography was fantastic. Tom Hooper has an eye for extremely creative shots. The direction and choreography was stunning.Honestly I can't point out anything bad about this movie. It was absolutely superb. I highly recommend you see this you won't be disappointed. Definitely recommend you families out there to watch it all together. You're in for an emotional and compelling experience.",10,2,3,30 April 2013
The Happening," The ultimate downfall of M Night Shyamalan
","Before watching this, I remembered people saying that this was poor. So I kept that in mind before watching it. I then watched this with friends on DVD and what a waste of time it was.The story had a very good start to it, but as the film went on, it just got ridicules and laughable. The virus spread through green life and the wind.There could have been a much better reason than that The filming and cinematography were great, I'll give you that.The characters were utterly pathetic. That was the most annoying element to the film. I cant believe Mark Whalberg took the role. Because during moments in the film when times were stressful, for example, when the characters were trying to get a car from someone. The person tried to drive away while Whalberg was trying to get him to take him and his family with him. Whalberg was trying to convince with most pathetic tone of voice and calmed expression. This would not happen in real life at all.Also, about the characters, when they find out how the virus spreads, where do they chose to stand? in a green field. Seriously, you must be joking.The acting was pretty bad. Maby its just because of their characters were atrocious.The only thing that gave me a bit of the shivers was the psychotic old woman living in the house by herself. I'm pretty sure that was used so many times in other movies.I'm quite glad there was little use of special effects to make the film affective but you can't get over how bad the film gets.I love M Night Shyamalan older films, The Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable. Hated The Village but Lady in the Water was pretty good though. Haven't seen Last Airbender yet though.This film really is his carer downfall, please don't bother wasting you're money on this. But I really recommend you his older films though.",2,0,1,29 June 2011
Die Hard," Bruce Willis rocks!
","This is one of the best action films I have ever seen. Story and plot is simple but awesome.Script is excellent, 'yipee ki yay motherfxxxer' what a genius quote. Willis was just right for the part for the old school hero cop, John Maclain, the type of cop in the that situation that makes it up as he goes along. Alan Rickman was awesome as the villain Hans Gruber, the type of villain that just doesn't care about anything except of what he is after.Non stop action and suspense and great lines, oh yeah now thats what Im talking about.If you want to watch a great action film with your mates, this is for you.",9,1,2,12 November 2008
The Green Mile," King and Darabont are Geniuses
","Im a huge fan of Stephen King, this is my second favourite adaptations. I usually read the novels before watching the films. I watched the film of this first. After I just had to read the novel, Stephen King, you have done a great job as usual.It was casted fantastically. Hanks was just right for the part of Paul Edgecomb. Michael Clark Duncan did an amazing part of John Coffy, ('like the drink, only not spelt the same'). He should have one an Oscar award. Everyone did great for their roles.Filmed and directed fantastically. Darabont couldn't do any better It is kept really close to the novel with no added scenes or added characters, which is a good thing.They did great with The Shawshank Redemption, but this is by far better.I recommend you read the book first before watching the film. They are definitely worth the read and watch.Well done Stephen and Frank",9,0,1,3 April 2009
The Conjuring," Wann is one of our saviours of modern horror
","I saw the trailer and read things about this and saw that it was done by James Wann, who I'm a large fan of and it was instantly on my watch list. I then went to see it and I have to say one word first of all...awesome!!.The plot was original and extremely effective. Yeah of course we seen family moves to new house and something goes wrong etc, but with the added bonus of the demonic witch, which again is very original and unique because I've never seen, in movies, a spirit who's a witch. It worked brilliantly. I also noticed the references of The Amityville Horror with the bad smells and the cold air which fit in really well with the story. You can tell Wann's a fan. I did notice that this wasn't a run of the mill jump scare movie. Yes it did have the odd jump moments but there were moments of when you're expected to jump and nothing happened which I love. Don't expect scare scenes all the time cause this is a slow burner, which I love and I reckon us horror fans, we need more of.The acting was great and character development worked very well. Again it's a slow burner so we get a lot of time to know everyone. Cinematography and camera-work were brilliant. Wann used very effective angles. Especially a scene involving one of the daughters looking under her bed, the camera completely flips over which I've never seen before.The scare scenes are very subtle by not showing any detail which I always love. There were times where you do see the witch but only for a split second. Why don't they use this effect in horror anymore. I wouldn't say its as scary as everyone says it is but there are times where it really gave me the creeps.Overall a great movie. James Wann has once again brought back original horror. But using a modern style. Horror fans this is one for you. Highly recommended. I actually cannot wait for the second chapter of Insidious. It actually looks like that it can work. Well its James Wann, what do we expect:D",8,0,2,20 August 2013
Scream," Great fun but not to be taken seriously
","I have heard a lot about this film before watching it. I heard it was scary and everything. I absolutely love horror films and books. I watched it, I didn't think it was scary at all but it kept me hooked to the screen.The story is good. A lot of the acting was awful and the script was pretty bad. But I still found it very entertaining and fun.The filming was good and the ending had a very good twist of finding out the killer.The mask was a cool icon and the voice on the phone was awesome. This is a good fun horror to watch with a bunch of your mates, to take the Micki and laugh at it. But taken seriously its rubbish.To be honest I think it's cool and bad at the same time. I still watch it to have a good laugh. There are lots of horrors that are so much better though.",8,0,2,30 June 2009
Prometheus," Over hyped and disappointing
","When I first heard that this was a prequel to the Alien saga (which I'm a big fan of), I did think at first 'OK, enough is enough with Alien, should of technically stopped at 3'. But then I found that was Ridley Scott doing it and that was step up for me. I saw many trailers. Still unsure about seeing it. Then I thought 'what the hey, I'll go and see it' Invited a few friends with me to see it last night. I came out the screen after very unsatisfied.The acting performances were great. Fassbender was very good. Noomi Rapace was really good and did a very convincing British accent, may have slipped a couple of times but that doesn't matter. Now the story, it ran in the same format as the first Alien film, OK, we've seen that format before, but lets just let it go and keep watching. It was nice to see new creatures other than the original ones. But let me ask, we know the 'engineers' created these creatures, but where is the explanation of the original ones? We also found that the engineers created humans, very unsure.Now the scene where Repace's character gives herself surgery in the surgery booth because there is a creature in her stomach, it was shocking but I thought it was ridiculous, how can you still be alive after giving yourself surgery without anaesthetic? I don't know.The ending of the film really frustrated me. In the first Alien film, we find that the engineer is in the ship, on his chair on the telescope, dead with ripped open rib cage. In this, after the ship crashes, he comes after Repace in her ship. There is a big continuity mistake between this and Alien. I'm sorry Ridley, but if you're trying to make a prequel, you've got it wrong.The CGI was probably the best thing about the movie. You can tell that Scott had a lot of fun with it.I'm sorry for all the spoilers and sounding rather grouchy. Overall, very disappointing. A prequel gone extremely wrong. Very over hyped, maybe it's because it has connection to Alien and It's Ridley, directing it. You might enjoy this if you haven't seen the quadrilogy but if you have, you can point the mistakes in this. It's good for entrainment, thats for sure. I did see that Ridley is planning a sequel. Well he better do better than this.",5,6,11,13 June 2012
Halloween," Boring
","During halloween night, I was really looking forward to seeing it and thinking it looked good, how wrong I was.Through out, I thought I was going to sleep. The story of Michel Myers was rushed with no information about him. Characters were annoying and didn't care for.I really don't know what people see in this, I really didn't like it.The ending was pathetic and stupid.They could of made the story a lot better. Yes, it did have a few tense moments, but were too rushed.Sorry Mr Carpenter, I didn't like it",7,2,7,14 December 2008
The Woman in Black," Horror needs more films like this. Welcome back Hammer
","I first heard of this by reading in Empire. I was was interested of how Dan Radcliffe could do in horror. I then saw many trailers and found out that it was done by Hammer studios. It was then, my excitement grew. Came out the cinema buzzing with excitement and happiness.The story was fantastic. I'm a huge fan of old, Gothic ghost stories. It kept me eyes on the screen all the time.The acting was great. Dan Radcliffe pulled the part off very well, but I think more dialogue is needed by him during scare scenes. The special effects were necessary. It didn't go over the top with CGI, which is a great thing. The scare scenes were amazing. Yes it was jumpy, but the creepy feeling stayed with me through out the film. It even made me nervous, which hasn't happened with horror in a while.I'm a large fan of horror and us horror fans need more films like this. There are times where we see a great modern horror, for example, 28 Days and Weeks Later, Drag Me To Hell, Insidious etc. But this doesn't happen all the time. All we get are horrors with over the top gore, no story, hateful characters and over the top CGI. Gore doesn't bother me but it has to have a reason and CGI, I don't mind, but it has to be necessary. I really wish that horror would go back to the good old days with great stories, lovable characters with enough tension that stays with you after the movie.I have become a large Hammer fan with the Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee Dracula films, Horror Express etc. Has Hammer returned with another great film, I think so!Seriously, horror fans, your in for an awesome movie.Please go and see it. I reckon you won't be disappointed. But I recommend you don't bring your children. How it got away with a 12 certificate is beyond me. Again, it even made me nervous and I'm 22. But other than that, your in for a good scare.",8,1,3,6 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Two words: Absolutely Superb
","Im 21 and have been a Potter fan since the age of 11. I love all the all the books and the films. I just came back from seeing this with my family and we were all blown away. The first part was fantastic. The trailers of this gave me high hopes and I knew I was in for a treat The acting was spectacular. Every single actor and actress did their absolute best. To me, they get better and better through the films.The filming was excellent, there are some variety of excellent shots.The story kept very well to the book from what I remember of the book. I was a bit nervous at first at parts with Snape's truth and the ending because I didn't think they were going to be added. But the great news is, they were. The emotional moments in the story were captured in the film brilliantly. I even heard my mum cry in the film and I'm sure there were more people crying. There were moments in the film where the audience applauded and cheered, for example, Ron and Hermione's kiss, Belatrix Lestrange's death etc. I even joined in on the applause.They even kept in the original soundtrack from the first movie at times which was great.The battle scenes were awesome. There were even times where the little child in me wanted to jump and cheer.When the film ended, all the cinema applauded and cheered and, again, I joined in. I really am going to miss Harry Potter. What a way to end the series.Potter fans, you have got to see it. Trust me, It will not be a waste of you're money.",10,0,2,15 July 2011
The Cabin in the Woods," Started off not bad and then...
","When I first heard about this and read the plot, I immediately thought about The Evil Dead (which I'm a huge fan of). So I said no about seeing this. Then I saw the very good reviews and heard friends of mine, saying it was good. I then watched the trailers and decided to give it go. When a friend and I left the movies, I said 'what was that?'The first half was the story is about friends staying at a cabin in the the woods and bad things happen. Yes, that has been done before (going back to The Evil Dead). But there was the plot about the company, which is new. This gave me some hope about the film being good.Then the second half came in, where you find out about all the information , twists and turns. This when it get's totally ridiculous. You find that this sought of thing is happening all over the world, involving horrific creatures, ghosts, demons etc. May I ask where did all these creatures come from? OK they may be man made, but I didn't hear any of the characters say that. I have to say, it was entertaining watching all the bad guys get killed by the creatures.Now the climax, this is where stupidity hit the peak. It is all for a ritual on feeding gods blood that are underground. If this doesn't happen, the world will be destroyed. You find that gods are bigger than Godzilla. What is going on with this. The writer of the film did an amazing job for The Avengers, but please don't let him do horror again. I reckon the child inside him went overboard and said while writing the script 'lets add this and lets add that'The acting was good enough but not really Oscar worthy. It was good to see Chris Hemsworth do something else.Seriously, I wouldn't bother with this at all. I would rather rent it on DVD.",4,5,12,13 May 2012
