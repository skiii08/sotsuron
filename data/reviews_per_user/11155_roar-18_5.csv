Walk the Line," Masterpiece!!
","I just saw this movie and i got to tell you, its one of the best movies ever made. This movie got the grip on you from the first frames to the end. Oh my, have i been impressed today :D I think this movie is superb wherever you like country music or not. I'm not a huge fan of country, i have heard a lot of songs but never bought a country CD or things like that. This movie isn't actually about country music. It's a story of a man, which had a very difficult growth and he somehow manages to slip into the record business and by a boom he's known all over the country. But success don't come cheap and he ends up in even more trouble, and this is told in a very sad way, i seriously got a tear out two in my eye corner.The love-story is so damn realistic it twists in your gut and it stroke me right through the heart as hard as it could. I really felt the pain in this movie. HUGE credits for the actors, producers and director. I cannot say how much i love this film.. One of the best ever made..Oh boy were i glad when it worked out in the end. :D Congratiolations.",10,1,2,3 August 2006
12 Angry Men," The Story is Amazing
","I saw the 1997 TV version of this movie in 1998 and i was thrilled by the way the story is told in this movie. I saw this version a few years later and were more thrilled by this one, as it is so extremely realistic in its way. The clue sits with the actors and the director who can make such a movie out of only a few film sets. Yes the whole movie is filmed in a single room with 12 men in it, and the tension rises for every minute, and for every minute something twists and turns.It's about 12 men who are about to vote for the chair on a man on trial. But one of them want to hear more about the case, can this man alone make all the others turn their statement from guilty to innocent ? This is one of the best movies ever made, and proves that the storyline is what make great movies. See this, and enjoy.",10,0,1,10 February 2006
Hostel," Creepy as hell
","I just watched this movie, after sitting here alone in the dark for the past hour or so i can honestly say that i had to take my eyes of the screen a few times. Some of the scenes are directly painful to watch, you will feel it hurt in every part of your body.but this is not like a meaningless horror movie, this movie has something else. Maybe it's in the dialogs and the story or maybe in the acting and the setting. I don't know really, maybe it's all of them.The actors do a great job, the music score is really horror, the story is a little weak, but it keeps it going, and the director is really a genius. I just love the way he plays with camera angles. And the cast in the movie, really says it all. What do a butcher look like ?. See the movie and you will agree. 'That is what a butcher looks like'. This is also the truth in the other roles.I loved the film, it is extremely horrifying but still very very entertaining. They brought horror to a new level with this one. And once again Quentin Tarrantino have involved himself in yet a genius flick.I give it 7 out of 10. The story was a little weak.",7,7,12,21 August 2006
Cars," Pixar = The kings of animation
","They made Toy Story, A bug's life, Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, The incredibles........ No need to say much more. Pixar don't loose the grip in this one, another fabulous animation flick with insane humor.I really wish i had their fantasy. These guys have so many hilarious ideas you keep on laughing veeery often through the whole movie. But OK, we have all seen this story before, trust me. But sometimes, what matters is how the story is told.And the animations is really something, it's eye candy. These guys know how to work their computers. And WOW how it was nice to hear Paul Newman's voice again, it really fits. Well, Owen Wilson also do a great job there. Actually every actor does a hilarious performance in this movie.I have to give this a 8. Well you know, the story. Seen it like 50 times, in 50 different movies that is. But hey. I loved the movie. GO SEE IT!",8,0,0,25 August 2006
Casino Royale," James Bond just got better
","I have just arrived from the cinema, and what i have experienced is.. WOW. For too long James Bond movies have been heading downhill, i will not go into details why i think so but this movie is a huge step UP.Daniel Craig is really someone who must have surprised a lot of people out there, with the campaigns that have been going on, the protests, all the talking about his height and hair color. Well after this film none of that matters, as Craig did a superb performance, he was a real pleasure to watch as Bond. And not just that, he have saved Bond.The movie has great acting, great directing, really moving and great dialogs and great music. It is maybe this years absolute best action film, no matter what people thinks of Blonds. ;)Bond is back, for a long time.",8,1,2,26 November 2006
