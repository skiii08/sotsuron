Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Timeless Classic and A Personal Favorite
","This has been my favorite movie of all time since I saw it as a young kid. It has something in it for everyone (action, romance, violence, wit, history, etc.). This is what cinema should always be: great performances, great story, great setting, and, most importantly, great fun to watch! I enjoy every second and every frame of this movie. All of the original Indiana Jones trilogy is classic for that matter. Harrison Ford went at the role with such character and charisma that he turned Indiana Jones into an absolutely iconic role that I have dreamed of playing for many years. An all time classic and still one of the most impressive movies ever made.",10,0,0,9 June 2016
