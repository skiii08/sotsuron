The New World," how could they make one of our great stories so boring?
","I have to say, as a history major I went into this moving with hope that it would do justice to the fact that history is interesting and that people should appreciate their past. I walked out thinking I should reconsider my major. This movie turned what could have been an epic into 10 minutes of dialog and 2 hours of watching people walk, just walk. The acting was superb, when they were actually given the chance to act and not just walk. With this cast and story I was hoping for so much, and it in no way delivered. While the cast, costumes, and scenery were all superb it meant nothing. There was no script to give it a backbone. I'm sorry to say that this movie was a 2 out of 10, it wasted my time on this earth that I will never get back.",2,10,19,20 January 2006
