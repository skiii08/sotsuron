Stop-Loss," Perhaps more suited to TV, but a good movie all the same!
","After watching 'Stop-Loss,' I noticed later in the day a commercial for it which indicated that this was produced by MTV films or something like that. I thought this was appropriate because while I watched 'Stop-Loss,' I couldn't help but notice that this film really would've worked better on the small screen.Ryan Phillippe plays the role of Brandon King, a young soldier who, after having served on over 150 missions in Iraq and seen the deaths of both the men under his command and civilians, is excited about the prospect of returning home after having done his duty for his country.While turning in his gear and filing his paperwork, he is informed that he is to be shipped back to Iraq: although he has done his time and served his country, his Commander in Chief has the explicit right to unilaterally extend his tour without his knowledge or authorization.Of course this isn't the only thing going on while the soldiers are back in the USA. Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds himself constantly in trouble as he battles alcohol addiction. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum), Brandon's best friend, returns to his girlfriend and assaults her while digging in a fox hole on their front lawn and arming himself with a handgun mere feet from a road where pedestrians and vehicles pass by.It is on this level that I believe 'Stop-Loss' ultimately fails. In the motion picture format, this story has to be constricted into 90 or 120 minutes, and as a result the focus is almost exclusively on Brandon. His outrage at having to report back to Iraq; his odyssey in traveling to meet a Senator who he thinks will help him get out; his coming into contact with many other Stop-Loss victims; his decision first to head for Canada, then Mexico, before he ultimately decides that he has to return to the military.In the duration of the story, Steve goes from unstable to willing re-enlisting, though there's no perspective on this. As Tommy's life disintegrates, Steve tries to guilt Brandon into returning. Tommy is ultimately discharged, and commits suicide: the tragedy is effective, however without really allowing us to witness the back story here of the other characters, there is an artificial melodrama feel to it! I also must admit that, after initially feeling sympathy for Steve's precarious mental stability, I began to really dislike him in this story. He hits his girlfriend and really never apologizes for it- he merely says he couldn't remember it. He over and over again judges and tries to guilt Brandon into abandoning what he feels is justice, and then when Brandon comes to Tommy's grave to pay his respects, Steve assaults him! Steve has re-enlisted because he wanted to be a sniper where he could hit his targets from further away and be in less danger- he does this and ultimately sacrifices his fianc√©e (he never discussed it with her), and still at the end has the nerve to, when Brandon seems to extend the olive branch, seem rather indifferent.I recommend the film rather strongly, but I feel like if it had been a TV movie, it would've really been something special!",8,2,7,29 March 2008
United 93," A Heartbreaking Recreation of 9/11
","When I went to see United 93, I simply could not get images of movies like 'The Delta Force' and so on out of my head. In the back of my mind, I was wholly afraid that this film would become a propaganda piece to illicit a neo-conservative surge of American patriotism that would leave a very disturbing after taste in my throat.By the end of the movie, several in the theater were crying. Many found themselves unable to move. I found myself unable to stop shaking at the conclusion of the film. All of the fears I had of the horror and heartbreak being overshadowed by racist depictions of terrorists and their insane causes were crushed under the weight of a film that really and truly does relive 9/11. It is with this understanding that I say this: make sure you are ready to relive it if you choose to see United 93, because the hopelessness and anxiety of that morning really does precipitate quite effectively in this film.So what is it about? Well, its about 9/11, and while it does chronicle the specific events of United 93 in a hypothetical way (no one can ever know everything that happened that day), it is much more about what happened in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania on that September 11th, 2001.It all starts with planning by a group of nervous, and predominately young, terrorists. They look just like everyone else, and convince other passengers for the most part that they are traveling alone on the plane. They bide their time and wait until their 'leader' gives the signal.Of course, while they are waiting, the horror unfolds largely amongst air traffic controllers who, trying to map out flight patterns and ensure the safety of the domestic air space, begin to notice many planes are no longer responsive, and are doing things that just don't seem to make any sense.Slowly but surely the course of events begins to play out, and one by one, planes are identified as being either hijacked, or suspected of hijack. Sometimes, not even the air traffic controllers know a plane has been hijacked until after it has already crashed (as in the first plane to hit the World Trade Centre- they believed it was American Airlines flight 11, however at the time that the first plane hit, AA11 also seems to disappear over NYC)- however with time, even NORAD begins to recognize the disturbing pattern and mobilize.'United 93' is not Hollywood in any way- in fact, it has a very realistic feel to it. For my part, I felt like it was 9/11 all over again, and I'm at a loss to describe it with anything but the word 'heartbreaking.' The passengers on United 93, at least in this movie, moved more for the preservation of their own lives than anything else- and I can't think of a better tribute to them than to acknowledge that. They knew their lives were not going to be spared; they made their move to first and foremost try and save their lives.Their bravery is not negated by an honest hypothesis of what happened on that September morning- rather in their determination not to be victims, they saved an Icon of American democracy, and their deed has attained a level of immortality that cannot be denied.I very strongly recommend this movie, but I must do so with a warning: you invest a lot emotionally in this story, and just make sure you're ready for it!",10,0,3,14 May 2006
Hostel," An Effective Journey into Depravity in the Tradition of Last House on the Left
","First of all, let me say I didn't want to see Hostel. In fact, if you read some of the discussion threads, I have been quite vicious on the movie: purely from the idea of what the movie is comprised of, asking questions like if the next avenue for horror will be to watch Police films and snuff films for our scares. Indeed, were it not for a nagging voice in my head accusing me of being a hypocrite for writing the movie off without so much as a viewing, I would never have gone to see this film.But I did, and I'm glad I did.The story you know of Hostel is this: a pair of American backpackers and an Icelandic backpacker are backpacking through Europe, looking for the next big orgy or sexcapade to keep them interested in their journey. In Amsterdam, the promise of the red light district is something they take up with glee until one night, when they return to their Hostel and are locked out. To their surprise, a friendly Russian allows them to crawl up the fire escape and party with him.He tells of a hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia, where the women are absolutely gorgeous, the sex is free and frequent, and he's quite certain that these two horny Americans and their hornier Icelandic friend can have the ultimate experience. At this point, I feel its important to interject a lesson: when you don't know someone, its best to smile and agree, but not take their advice.As soon as they can manage it, the trio is on the next thing smoking to Bratislava. On the way, they encounter an elderly traveler who confirms their hopes about Bratislava, but freaks out the nice lad Josh when he makes a somewhat minor homosexual advance. Of course, Josh's reaction will be one that he will wish he could take back, but he will not get the opportunity.In Bratislava, they are placed in a hostel room that is co-ed, and the two women in the room, both of whom are Russian, prove that their advice about Bratislava is correct. Things seem to be going good when our Americans Josh and Paxton bed their roommates.However in the morning, they are told that their Icelandic traveling companion Oli has checked out, and they come across a photo of him and a Japanese girl who was also staying in the Hostel, provided by her traveling companion. It all feels too strange for Josh, but Paxton tries to convince him to give in to all of his desires as they didn't really know Oli at all, and he could very well have left them.It turns out to be bad advice. They will soon find out that there is a torture/murder service available here that allows the highest bidder to live out his/her fantasies of torturing or killing another human being. Josh, Paxton, Oli, and all the others have been sold to be slaughtered for the highest bidder.To provide anymore detail about the movie would eliminate the tension that the movie works so hard to create, so I will not go any further to reveal what happens. I will however say this: Hostel does have an abundance of gory, disturbing, torturous scenes that sensitive viewers will definitely find over the top, and so I believe a more mature audience is an absolute must.The story in my opinion resembles 'The Last House on the Left' not only due to the torture elements, but also due to the conclusion, which I feel actually renders this film as a very good one. Unlike with the abominable 'Wolf Creek,' 'Hostel' does not hand over all of the power to the malicious, sadist, nor does it portray a preference for female suffering that gives it a very misogynistic feel. The victims in this movie do suffer, but something else comes out of them as well: a desperation, a defiance, compassion and a mean streak that balances out the movie to a very effective degree in my opinion.The bad guy sometimes CAN be a woman. The good guy sometimes DOES try to help out others. The good guy can be forever changed by his encounter enough to take bloody revenge on those who so cruelly and coldly murdered people for money.Eli Roth took the movie in a direction that I certainly didn't see coming- it was through moving in that direction that he places Hostel above movies like 'High Tension' and 'Wolf Creek.' For the first time, we have a quality movie to compare to 'Last House on the Left,' and I for one enjoyed the journey, even if at times it is hard to watch and listen to!",8,4,8,6 January 2006
Silent Hill," Looks Great, but Less Filling!!!
","'Silent Hill' reminds me an awful lot of 'Underworld,' but with much less fun, and much more blood and gore. Strange that, even when compared to a film which chronicles the BLOOD feud between Lycantropes and Vampires, this atmospheric shocker should still manage to saturate its audience in buckets of gore.The story, at its base, is about an adopted girl with a troubled past whose Mother decides, over her husband's objections, to take her back to Silent Hill, West Virginia. Along the way, her trip is interrupted by, amongst other things, her husbands phone calls, his decision to freeze her credit cards, and a police officer who is strangely tipped on to the idea that something isn't right when she sees the little girl ask her mother in an upset voice who drew the pictures that are in her sketch book.Rose decides to bolt it when she is stopped by the officer, and would have kept on going had it not been for what appeared to be another little girl who looked exactly the same who she thinks she may have pasted all over the road. Apparently in the spirit of helping your child, it may be necessary to sacrifice another.Once in Silent Hill Rose, her daughter Sharon, and the police officer all become stuck in what is allegedly another dimension, filled with giant and ravenous cockroaches, strange creatures of other shapes and abilities, and a group of old Silent Hill residents who apparently are trapped and damned in the dimension.Some critics have noted that, in spite of the very impressive visuals, Silent Hill does play out like a video game- and they are precisely right. Rose, the officer, and a myriad of others who occasionally tag along are led from room to room, as though they are collecting keys, clues or whatever one might collect when playing the Silent Hill video game- at one point, you half expect to see a couple of icons on the screen indicating how many lives each character has left before they die.Of course, all of it is a moot point. Silent Hill's trailer, which was played ad nausea in practically every movie I've seen for the past five months, happily doesn't give so much away in terms of the surprises of the characters that are about to come, however the shock factor tends to diminish when it becomes clearer that with each character and each killing the director is merely trying to push the envelope further.As for the ending, and the ultimate assignment of 'right' and 'wrong' which should accompany any self-redeeming horror film, it is so badly handled and so unclear to the viewer (save perhaps for those who have played the game and live for it) that one hardly knows if Rose and Sharon were lucky victims who escaped the horror, or a villainous pair who aided in the murder of the remaining citizens of Silent Hill. After all, they did take the word and opinion of the little girl who was behind all of these creatures. And yeah, she seemed nice enough when she was talking to Rose.Then again, she does seem to enjoy ripping apart person after person in the gory finale with barbed wire, and she hardly rewards Rose for her love for Sharon...if indeed you can consider Sharon anything but a ghost herself! So to sum it all up, if you see the movie, you'll see a lot of very disturbing and haunting images, and some rather unique characters- however limit your interest to just these areas. Looking for anything beyond these is a fruitless effort!",4,2,4,22 April 2006
28 Weeks Later," One Screwed up Sequel!
","When it comes to the horror genre, all the 21st century typically has is the rip off, the re-make or the sequel. The difference is as follows: the rip off is 'inspired' by the ideals in a film, but technically utilizes them in a 'different' way for the same effect; the re-make is pretty much self explanatory, and so too is the sequel.Guess what money making venture is at work here?Of course '28 Weeks Later' could've been good. Very good in fact...had it remained committed to the ideals of the original instead of inventing a new set of rules.The story is as follows: 1- Couple is happy they sent their son and daughter abroad. They are then attacked by the infected, leaving the husband. 2- Several weeks after the infection has receded, the US Army takes control of re-settling the country. The 15,000 who haven't been killed and/or infected are placed in a quarantined zone of London. Father is reunited with his son and daughter. 3- Son realizes he doesn't have a photo of his Mom- persuades his sister to go out with him back to their home to recover a photo. While there, they find Mom. 4- Mom is the only person in the country who didn't become infected, but is a carrier. She also has different colored eyes...as has her son. Mom is taken into quarantine. 5- Kids confront Dad. Dad uses his all access key card (yeah, in a military lock down, a civilian who isn't US military has an all access key card...didn't make sense to me either) to get to his wife...kisses her, becomes infected, and it starts all over again. 6- Kids survive...but the other's who were with them aren't so lucky. And the son/brother does turn out to be a carrier, but not effected by the virus- so he's the key to solving the infection!As for the flaws:1- A civilian with all access to every place? This is military quarantine...they are prepared to exterminate everyone. So they don't even bother keeping the person who is shown to be infected with the virus in a secured area with armed guards and surveillance? It doesn't make sense.2- Okay, I realize that its become very popular in this genre to have the audience guessing at what just happened: but enough is enough. C'mon...the shaking camera has to go. At several points in this film, when the infected were attacking, the camera work becomes so jittery that you can't even make out what is happening. One could suggest the director was trying to spare the audience from buckets of gore- of course that loses some of its effectiveness when exploding heads and infected vomiting blood all over a car windshield are brought into the mix. 3- This film missed the mark completely! The original contrasted the instinct driven rage driven infected with the sinister motives of the armed bullies who decide to succumb to another sort of madness. It did it in a way that was both unique and exciting. If this film wanted to make an interesting sequel, it should've employed the same sense of creativity! Maybe the issue for survivors of this kind of circumstance would be 'cabin fever.' Maybe its something different. Either way, this film just didn't work at all.",2,6,13,13 May 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," A Rare, Great Remake
","I have deleted my old posting to provide a new one, in part because of what feels like a very condescending lecture of moralistic people who seem to think that simply because a movie pushes the boundaries, it is unworthy of consideration. For the sake of would be viewers, I will return to this point at the end.The Hills Have Eyes is a faithful remake of the 1977 horror classic of the same name that was made on a shoe string by a young director who had found his voice but still wanted to test his boundaries. The original movie, like MANY films of the 1970's, explored and played upon the fears that were common to people: a family traveling through the Southwestern USA to their silver mine is stranded and ultimately played upon by a brutal clan of humans who, through exposure to nuclear fallout and isolation in a desolate region, have developed an unrelenting and terrifying habit of killing and eating those who happen along their path.The 1977 film was characterized by an original storyline, colorful and flamboyant family of villains, a God fearing and conservative family of vacationers, and an atmosphere of beauty and desolation that is both inspiring and terrifying. The remake incorporates many of these same qualities.In this remake, a family trip to San Diego to celebrate the Silver Anniversary of the Big Bob Carter and Ethel Carter are stranded when the short cut they are directed to is booby trapped by the mutant clan of cannibals who time has forgotten and society has abandoned.Along for the trip are the Carter's three children, Lynn, Brenda and Bobby, Lynn's husband Doug, and their baby Catherine. Ironically for the first time in a LONG TIME, I find that I've had no problems remembering the names of the characters- usually that tells me that I've seen a movie that has touched me in a certain way.And ladies and gentlemen, there is no avoiding the issue: the Hills Have Eyes is NOT a pleasant horror movie. The scene inside the trailer, in which Brenda is sexually assaulted, Lynn is sexually assaulted and murdered, and Ethel is murdered is brutal, no question about that! But really, what did people expect they were going to see? As the story line continues, once stranded, the family is subjected to a brutal and gruesome assault that robs three of them of their lives, leaves a fourth cripplingly traumatized, and sees the baby kidnapped. You see, Alexandre Aja has sent a very strong message here: in the dark places and remote stretches of the USA, not everyone follows the same rules that we, living in a civilized society, might think of as being paramount in the conduct of all.Of course for me, what I admire most about Aja's remake is the way the truth of the peril descends upon each member of the family in a different way, and how these truths, when weaved together, would have given the family plenty of warning. Big Bob finds the bag and the newspaper clippings; Lynn sees the mirror signals in the hills; Ethel hears the breathing on the radio; Bobby finds the dog Beauty dead; Doug finds the crater with discarded vehicles and possessions. Individually, these things are meaningless, however when they are interwoven together, the paint a very clear message of doom that, although Bobby comes to understand before the assault on the trailer, comes too late to prevent the carnage.There are subtle differences in the tone of the two movies, but for the most part, you are watching a very faithful remake of the original 1977 film- this is something that horror fans respect very much. Of course, the idea that horror fans should be held to a different standard because they don't delude themselves in the notion that the brutality should be a deterrent is ridiculous: simply note the differing reactions between a movie like this, or like 'Hostel,' and movies like the 'When a Stranger Calls' remake.Having said that however, the truth is that this film DOES improve upon the original in many ways. While I missed the spirit of family that was incorporated in the original through Papa Jup's position as Patriarch, this remake featured better acting, more interaction with Big Bob & Ethel's family, and a wider storyline. I did feel for the characters to a great deal.To come back to the scene in the trailer, I found it very difficult to watch; I also found it difficult to watch the scene outside the trailer, when Big Bob burns to death to distract the others from what is about to transpire inside the trailer. If it makes you feel better, leave the theater while it happens. It does surprise that those who would profess to being disgusted by the scene inside the trailer wouldn't find the scene outside the trailer as disturbing- as Big Bob burns to death.But to summarize, the film is unrelenting in its depiction of the savagery of people that can be effected by the circumstances in which they live or those in which they grow. The only question you have to ask yourself is: can you handle watching a movie like that or not? If you can't, then I'd suggest you consider the remake of 'When a Stranger Calls.' If you can, this movie is for you.In spite of all the cries that this film is sick and pointless, I still maintain quite pointedly that it is nowhere near as cold as the putrid film 'Wolf Creek.'",10,0,3,28 March 2006
Across the Universe," Where is the Essence of this Movie?
","When looking at movies, sometimes you have to be willing to suspend your normal conventions and accept something totally off the wall. It is no doubt this reaction that Julie Taymour is looking for with her film 'Across the Universe.' When watching the trailers, I got a feeling that this film was, at its essence, a film about the protest movement of the 70's, and the free spirits that fueled this movement. Well, having watched it, I have to say that I don't have that sense anymore. In fact, I'm not sure what, at its essence, this film is about.To rehash the plot as I saw it, a young Englishman named Jude ventures over to the USA in search of the father he never knew...the father who as a soldier left his mother with 'a bun in the oven,' and never saw her again. When he makes it to the USA, he finds out that his father is a janitor who has a wife and children. On this, one could feel for Jude.Then, through 'fate,' Jude meets a privileged jerk named Max who, having whacked a golf ball through the window of some other students, looks to hide so that he doesn't have to face the consequences of his actions. Privileged jerk is the ONLY thing that seems to sum up Max, though in spite of the obvious differences in their character, Jude and Max become friends.The reality is that this 'friendship' is only a smoke screen to bring Lucy into Jude's radar. You see, even though he has a girlfriend in England who he promises to write, once Lucy comes on the scene, Jude forgets all about his girlfriend, and decides to carve out a new life for himself in New York with Lucy.Max is drafted into the army, and tries to get out of serving by telling them he's a 'cross dressing homosexual with a spot' on his lung (put there by swallowing a cotton ball), however he is unsuccessful and this prompts Lucy (who lost her first boyfriend to the Vietnam war) to take up a protest cause. And Jude, who once told Lucy that he loved Max, becomes jealous of Lucy's relationship with protest leader Paco.Inject into all of this a litany of images, overexposed colors, colorful characters and the number of times one feels like this is all supposed to be a drug induced haze runs practically from the beginning right through to the end of the movie.'Across the Universe' is undoubtedly a musical, looking to work 60's and 70's music over and over into the action of the story. It is impossible not to make comparison's with the other musical released this year, 'Hairspray,' and yet the truth is that for all the 'ground breaking visuals' that Taymour concocts, the film is no where near as fun as 'Hairspray,' and no where near as effective. The dancing that made sense in 'Hairspray' doesn't make near as much sense here! So what does it have going for it? Well, lots of pretty, pretty people, and lots of colorful characters. Jude's first compliment to Lucy is that she has perfect teeth, however so does he. The funny thing is that he shouldn't have perfect teeth- he's neither rich enough to see a dentist on a regular basis, nor disciplined enough (i.e. he's a smoker) to make any sense of his appearance.Jude is also so judgmental of his father for abandoning his mother, however he does pretty much an even more selfish thing in abandoning his girlfriend to carve out some living in the USA, which he technically didn't have a right to do.After having sat through 'Across the Universe' for 90 minutes, I'd finally had enough and walked out. If what you're looking for in a film is the feel of an acid trip, then perhaps this is the film for you. If not, I'd recommend you try another film: 'Hairspray.'",4,4,12,20 September 2007
The Mist," Thank God for Visual Effects, eh?
","'The Mist' first and foremost finds itself in a rather peculiar position. You see, the novella by Stephen King has been suggested as having inspired the video game 'Silent Hill.' In turn the video game 'Silent Hill' lead to a movie by the same name. In turn, this adaptation of 'The Mist' seems to owe a lot of its inspiration to the movie version of the video game 'Silent Hill.' So, if you liked 'Silent Hill' the movie, its a good bet you'll like 'The Mist.' The story I think has been told before, but here goes: an artist and his wife and child manage to make it through a bad storm. In the aftermath of the damage to the home, the husband and son head into town, taking along the sometime friend sometime foe neighbor to pick up supplies.While in town, a mist (go figure, eh?) envelopes the store, and a man shouting about something in the mist lead the people inside to close up the doors and remain inside.As always happens in these movies, first it begins by grabbing one person (the stock boy as he's trying to go out to clear the generator so that it won't backup), and then it has its fill of the neighbor and his band of cynics who venture out to get help.While all of this is going on, a religious fundamentalist (played admirably by Marcia Gay Harden) recruits the majority inside the store to offer ritual sacrifice to appease the vengeful God that she claims to be representing as a vessel. A minority inside the store plan first to get some medicines from the pharmacy next door, and then finally they plan to leave before the flock turn on them.The visuals in 'The Mist' aren't really all that impressive- amongst the creatures inhabiting the mist are large winged insects with sharp stingers, large spiders with webs that burn through clothing and skin, a giant preying mantis like creature, winged creatures that look like a cross between a bat and a dinosaur, tentacles from a creature we never see, and so on. The reality to all of this however is that none of these creatures actually looks real.Now I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Certainly the way these creatures lay waste to the hapless inside the store is creepy enough, but perhaps if they looked more authentic, the movie might take on a more disturbing tone than it already does.I won't give away the ending, for all the commercials are a buzz about this ending you don't see coming. Having said that, I will say this about the ending: it is one of the most depressing I've seen in a very long time, and it would seem it is also illogical as it plays out.The movie has a more interesting human component than 'Silent Hill' did, but its visuals aren't as original (perhaps after the movie 'Silent Hill,' visuals such as these never will be as original or as authentic) and so its level of creepy allure fades pretty quickly. Its worth a look if you'd like to try your luck with these types of scares, but don't go in expecting the same quality of film as 'The Green Mile' or 'The Shawshank Redemption.' There's a reason why this film settles for Thomas Jane instead of Tom Hanks.",6,2,7,24 November 2007
Saw II," With the Success of the First, They Couldn't Spend a Little More?
","I find it ironic that 'Saw II' is rated 'R,' yet the demographic that was the most impressed and thus has dragged it up to its cumulative rating on the IMDb site is those under aged 18. Of course, for authentic fans of the horror genre, and for those who admired the powerful message so effectively delivered in the film 'Seven,' the original 'Saw' may have worked, but this beginning of yet another suffocating franchise in the bowels of horror film history is yet just another forgettable sequel.In this one, Donnie Wahlberg (yes, formerly of that New Kids on the Block rubbish- perhaps the most witty aspect of this story is that he is now cast as a father of a rebellious and bitter child) plays a detective who has captured the elusive Jigsaw architect (see below for elaboration on why I refer to him as this), but who is now set in another game to play- to save a whole group of victims. As the coming events play out, Donnie himself is the target of Jigsaw in a twist so ridiculous, you have to have been born with part of your brain missing to have missed it.As for the omnipotent Jigsaw Architect, who boasts that he's never killed anyone (which is a lie- just by sheerly leaving Adam (Leigh Whannel) in the original chained to a pipe and closing the door behind him, he has in effect murdered him. But lets buy into the little game-is anyone else as fed up as I am with this ridiculous fiasco? Once again we are treated to the fact that Jigsaw has inoperable cancer, and to his holier than thou proclamation 'those who don't value life don't deserve life.' And what makes him a fair judge of who is deserving and who is not? I know that someone will come along with some malarkey that legitimizes this story line, and from the way this one ended, the former druggie who is the only survivor of his diabolical planning (interesting that he's never killed anyone, but only ONE PERSON has ever survived his plans) in this one decides to assume the legacy. I guess the near brush with death didn't actually teach her any lessons worth learning- like don't try and kill others! But my biggest pet peeve with this movie is that the original managed to be the sleeper hit of 2004, making over $100 million, and doing it on a budget that shoe stringed on everything, including the driving effects. What does it have to show for it? The sequel incorporates the same cheap and cheesy effects, and actually limits itself in settings, and in actors. Not one actor in this film matches the caliber of Danny Glover in the original...and even though audiences will no doubt notice a few more familiar faces in this film, its only because there are more faces.A sad and pathetic effort on this one...not even worthy of your attention because it doesn't even have the originality of the first movie.",4,0,0,20 February 2006
Paranormal Activity," A Good Effort...but one not everyone can appreciate!
","I'm sorry, but no! This is not the scariest movie of all time, nor is it guaranteed to leave you experiencing nightmares...unless you are already predisposed to being very sensitive to these types of films.Long story short: a haunted woman and her boyfriend of 3 years, living the American dream, are being tormented by a presence which opens and closes their doors, leaves three toed foot prints around the house, and apparently has been burning an effigy for the wife in the attic.They consult a psychic who tells them that this isn't a ghost, but rather a demon, and it feeds of negativity. He recommends a demonologist, which of course leads to an increase in tension in the relationship because the stereotypical boyfriend doesn't like the idea of having someone else solve his pet project. This, in turn, leads to fighting, which in turn leads to more substantial paranormal activity, and so on.Before you know it, the girlfriend is showing all the signs of possession, which in turn culminates in a finale that is only mildly creepy for those who have seen the Spider walk scene from 'The Exorcist.' The performances in the film seem rather authentic, and so one has to admire the film maker: after all, it's not everyday that a film that cost just $15,000 can generate this kind of buzz.However for me, this film just wasn't effective or scary! Don't believe the hype...see it and judge for yourself!",5,6,12,19 October 2009
In Time," The Social Commentary is obvious...but the film still stands out well!
","It's interesting that this film is coming out now, as the 'Occupy' movement is raging in several cities around the world. It couldn't be more opportune for a film like this, which makes an obvious statement about the concentration of resources in the hands of a few, and the pain and complexity the creates in the lives of the many.Justin Timberlake is impressive as Will Salas, a 28 year old man who is chronically living day to day, literally, due to the fact that he was born in a slum, in a world where your life span is the only currency out there. Of course we are left with no doubt that although he feels the pressure acutely, he is still very generous to the people in his community.One night at a local bar, Will happens to meet Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a man who has lots of time, but is weary after having living for more than a century already. Will saves Henry from a gang of time hustlers known as 'Minute Men' by hiding out in a factory. It is there, after Will sleeps, that Henry empties his clock of all but 5 minutes, topping up Will's life span before leaving to secure a poetic end for himself.Will all this time on his clock, Will gives some to his drunkard friend, and intends to use much of the rest to treat his 50 year old Mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde), only to get to her too late to prevent her from 'timing out' for good. Devastated by her loss, Will decides to work to help others and shake up the system.Along the way, Will is pursued Timekeeper Leon (played effectively by Cillian Murphy) and by Fortis (supurbly played by the gorgeous Alex Pettyfer) and his Minute Men gang. While trying to evade both men and their factions, Will takes rich girl Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) hostage...which turns into a romance There are some scenes that are fun to watch...among the funnest for me was the showdown between Will and Fortis. Fortis and his men capture Will and Sylvia, and as he was holding a personal grudge, Fortis decides to fight Will, man to man, as they do it in that futuristic day. Of course little does Fortis know that Will learned how to fight from his Father...and before he knows it, his men are shot dead, and Fortis himself is 'timed out' (or in other words, killed) by Will. It is an excellent scene in a very good film! The film itself however works because the commentary is so relevant: Will sees the system for it's cruelty, but as he works to change it, he's unable to do it without the help of Sylvia. Timekeeper Leon was once in the ghetto like Will, and he seems to be a fair man, but he believes that the system is the best one available to THIS society at THIS time...so it's best to uphold it and accept it. Fortis is the scumbag criminal (albeit gorgeous) who plays dirty and cannibalizes his own community to get ahead...so he likes the system because it lets him do what he wants to do. Sylvia is the curious and insulated branch of affluence who knows the system is unfair, but is unsure of how to change it.Check out this film...it's certainly worth it!",9,39,68,28 October 2011
The Happening," There is a 17% chance you might find this movie good...
","...and about a 99% chance that you will hear this title when it comes to awarding the Golden Raspberry award, while an equal chance you won't hear it once during the Oscar telecast! To summarize this film as best I can, the environment strikes a blow towards the extermination of the human race. The trees, long suffering at the hands of humans, begin to seep toxins (and obviously, a breeze...how that happens I'm not sure!!!) which cause a reaction in humans.What kind of reaction? Well, it prompts a zombie like state in which the human victims seem unable to prevent themselves from killing themselves, however they do have the foresight and planning to plan out ways to kill themselves.And kill themselves they do: whether its jamming a hair pin into their throats, walking the plank on a construction sight, steering a riding lawn mower and then proceeding to lay under it, or feeding limbs to lions, the level of uncomfortable ways to die seem to be ratcheted up over and over again! There's nothing really unique in the idea of nature vs humanity, however the common sense in this film is lacking, and it is that which becomes incredibly annoying! For instance Julian (John Leguizamo) pulls a number seemingly out of his head to express the chances that Trenton, NJ, where his wife was headed, is safe from the toxins. Of course, the minute he separates from Elliot (Mark Wahlberg), we know its only a matter of time before he bites the big one! Another problem is that the film seems to turn upon itself in its own contradictions. For instance, this toxin which is theorized produced by the trees, grass and bushes creates a sudden sense of disorientation which prevents the infected from speaking or remembering what they were doing just before- however in the zombie like state, it doesn't prevent them from devising rather complex methods of ending their lives. So in essence, its not hallucinations that the toxin prompts, but rather it is mind control! Does that really make sense? I know that Hollywood is sounding the alarms about the planet in part because there doesn't seem to be the political will to tackle the problem, however enough is enough.As a side note, if you have lost someone to suicide, or are susceptible to suicidal ideation's/planning, or if you are horrified by the thought of suicide, this film really isn't for you. Having lost a family member to suicide, I found watching it problematic!",3,2,7,16 June 2008
Never Back Down," What's the big deal???
","Okay, I have to admit that before I went to see 'Never Back Down,' as I searched the myriad of opinions on this film, I was struck at the ranges this movie got. Some people loved it, others hated it. Then I began to notice...most of those who hated the film did so because they seem to believe the film ripped of 'Karate Kid.' Its easy to see that their position is certainly merited- after all, this film is about a young man who is more or less relocated against his will, and finds himself in a situation where someone who is tougher and more talented is putting a pounding on him. Of course as with any film about a 'young man,' throw in the obligatory hurdles and rewards- the pretty girl, the wise man, the single mother, the tragedy, and of course the finale in which he gets even.Yes, that's 'Karate Kid,' but its not unique or even original to 'Karate Kid.' And even if it had been, so what- 'Never Back Down' captures the teen angst angle that 'Karate Kid' captured almost 25 years ago. What this film has done is essentially recreated it so that a new generation of people can connect with the story- and the recreation includes replacing what was the 'exotic' art of Karate with MMA.Of course the quality of the two films are not identical. Djimon Hounsou is more than serviceable as the MMA master Jean Roqua- his apparent poverty and mastery of his art conceal his pain and his compassion for his new student, Jake Tyler.I think one point however has to be made: the insinuation of every kid in Orlando being apparently connected to a mansion and having lavish liquor fueled MMA brawling house parties gets pretty irritating after a while.But that aside, this story is what it is, and the best advice I can give people who are pondering paying to see this movie is this: if you cannot stomach watching a teen angst movie, or if 'The Karate Kid' is not a movie you could appreciate in spite of its obvious limitations, then you'd be better served passing up this film.",5,4,7,18 March 2008
Prometheus," Lots of pop, but too muddled to become another classic!
","I originally saw the teasers for 'Prometheus,' and to be honest I wasn't really looking forward to it.Then, after reading some of the reviews on other websites, and seeing the more recent trailers, I became more interested. And then, seeing the cast (Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace in particular), my interest was fully stoked, and I went into this expecting to see a classic.What I got...was modest entertainment, but a far cry from what I was expecting.The story, as it goes, is that two researchers near the close of the 23rd century find cave art from various, primitive civilizations, which seems to suggest that humanity may finally be able to find the 'engineers' who engineered...us.Fast forward a few minutes, and a full crew in cryostasis on board the trillion dollar ship called the 'Prometheus' arrives at a planet that seems to be very Earth like...but for the fact that it has no atmosphere that is capable of sustaining human life.The crew ironically enough without a short time of arriving on the planet discover topographical markings that seem to suggest that we may have found them. And upon further exploration, it is discovered that they have found them: humanoid creatures that apparently share our DNA completely...except that they seem to average 8 to 10 feet in height, and are considerably stronger than us.And for the most part, they are dead.Naturally the crew are scientists, so they recover the head of one of these beings, while the android David (played by Fassbender) embarks on his own secret, clandestine, malevolent mission...which includes engineering the demise of his master, and infecting another crew member with an alien organism.The alien organisms start to pick off the human crew members of the Prometheus, resulting in chasing and carnage and leaving a sole survivor who is effectively stranded on an alien world, without the hope of rescue, and the birth of a new species...which suggests that this film may have been intended to be the prequel to the 'Alien' saga.The film is effective at keeping you engaged, and providing some mild scares...but for the most part, as I watched it, I found myself completely underwhelmed. This is a new role for Noomi Rapace, and she's decent in the film, but she has more talent than gets showcased in this.The same goes for Michael Fassbender: coming off a year where he played a psychologist with an ethical dilemma ('A Dangerous Method'), a short lived but a suave, extremely sexy and ruthless assassin ('Haywire'), a tortured mutant with almost unmatchable powers who kills a madman and leads a rebellion ('X-Men: First Class') and a conflicted man struggling with a sex addiction ('Shame'), this seems like a real come down for him.This isn't a bad film...but I think it's been over-hyped, and if you buy the hype, you may not enjoy what you get to see.",7,0,1,9 June 2012
Halloween," Grand Daddy of the Slasher Genre- No One Did It Better
","What is a slasher film, and how does it function effectively? That would make a great topic of discussion for this film, John Carpenter's 'Halloween,' because the viewer should know that in watching this film, you are really watching the birth of a sub-genre- something that doesn't happen every day.True, prior to Halloween there were foray's into the depraved and violent. Films like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Black Christmas' also introduced us to the concept of the psychopath, and how he can function so effectively in a malevolent fashion prior to 'Halloween.' However 'Halloween' dons the role of father of the slasher sub-genre because it was Halloween, and not 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' 'Last House on the Left' or 'Black Christmas' that a myriad of filmmakers tried without success to duplicate.The genius of Halloween is the simplicity of its story, and the intensity of its madman. The story is about three girlfriends who, during a night of babysitting, are ruthlessly attacked and dispatched by a masked maniac who seems to be driven to his impulse to kill without provocation or logic.If people find modern movies like 'Hostel,' 'High Tension' or 'Wolf Creek' to be tense and frightening, how then will they react to this film. One of the girls, Annie, has but to turn around whilst she's on the phone and she will come face to face with the masked monster- yet she doesn't in time to see him.Linda does come face to face with the monster, but only when he's covered over with a sheet in a crude mocking imitation of her boyfriend, who the masked killer had dispatched earlier. In the course of the next few minutes, she too is dispatched in a cold and calculating way by the monster.The monster of course is Michael Myers, however I prefer the logic of calling him 'The Shape' because there is no emotion or urgency that surrounds him. He is like a zombie in his movements and expressions, yet violently efficient in his actions- so much so that we get the real sense of what it would feel like to be stalked, yet without the understanding of why the monster feels compelled to stalk.Ultimately in the final scene, the virtuous and shy Laurie (played by Jamie Lee Curtis in a truly all-American girl next door kind of performance) squares off with the Shape, sacrificing herself so that her charges (the children she is babysitting) can escape and call for help.Along the way, the movie is full of valid indictments about our vary lives which are still true right up to this day: the passive neighbors who refuse to help Laurie when she is pursued by the Shape; the expert who is ignored by the establishment that is committed to its procedures; the absolute need to scapegoat. Perhaps it is this relevance to our own lives that makes Halloween so terrifying.Either way, if you're one of the few who has not seen this film yet, might I recommend you give it a peak. You won't be sorry...unless you have an aversion to very scary films!",10,0,1,12 February 2006
Beowulf," Impressive in 3D, but why not use live action film?
","Beowulf has the distinction, at least in my memory, of being the sole Hollywood release that has been filmed entirely in 3D. Unfortunately it is also filmed in a form of animation that seems to exist between both the live action and animated elements of film making. Given the advancement of visual effects, why the film wouldn't take part in a live action element seems to be contradictory- live action film would undoubtedly require more sets and such, but the fact that the film is in 3D disputes the entire idea that the film making was lazy.In fairness, the film 'Beowulf' pretty accurately follows the myth of Beowulf. To clarify, a Danish kingdom is cursed by a sinister creature named 'Grendel.' The King of the Kingdom (Anthony Hopkins) is obviously the father of 'Grendel,' and the mother of Grendel is a 'water demon.' After a vicious attack on the new Hall, the building is securely locked up until Beowulf and his men come as heroes to slay the beast. Beowulf kills Grendel by ripping his arm off, which sends Grendel's mother into a rage. The morning after his success, Beowulf awakes in the hall to find that all but one of his men have been dispatched (presumably by Grendel's mother) and hung up in the ceiling.After this outrage, Beowulf travels to a nearby cave to slay Grendel's mother. Of course this doesn't happen- Grendel's mother seduces Beowulf into giving her another son, and in turn she has given him long lasting strength, a kingdom (he inherits it after Anthony Hopkins throws himself off a cliff), a Queen who he has longed after since arriving, and so on. The one limitation is that his good fortune will only last as long as a golden horn remains in the cave.Fast forward many years, with a much older Beowulf, who has a dilemma when the slave of a Priest finds the golden horn and brings it out to the kingdom. With the golden horn brought out, Beowulf's son (a dragon) arrives to unleash another hell onto the Kingdom.In the spirit of a happy ending, the dragon is slain, however in the spirit of a disjointed conclusion, Grendel/Dragon's mother arrives on the scene to try and seduce the new King of the Kingdom. This is where the film ends.The IMAX 3D is the only way to see this film, and it is definitely worth watching for this angle. However I don't recommend it in a regular theater- my rating with go from 7/10 to 5/10.",7,2,4,28 November 2007
Footloose," Not terrible, but not terribly good either!
","Lets keep this review short: if you go to see this reboot of Footloose, you may like it better if you're completely unfamiliar with the original. To be fair, the original film was a box office hit, but it was far from a hit with critics: having said all of this however, the remake is far weaker than the original.Kenny Wormald plays Ren, a young man who has just endured the loss of his Mother. This is different from the original, as Ren and his Mother travel to Bomont (Georgia?) following the death of his Father, if I'm not mistaken. In this reboot, there is a more misandristic tone: Ren's Father was a deadbeat, and his Mother was the one who died.Wormald has screen presence, but he had some huge shoes to fill...and I think this is a case where too much of the original was left in this remake. For instance, there is the scene in the original where Ren (as played by Kevin Bacon) is struggling with the impact of being accosted by his Uncle, harassed by the police, accused by the Principal of the school, teased by Ariel and bullied by Chuck...and he takes out his frustrations in a warehouse. In the original, you can kind of understand why Ren is so angry: he has no outlet for his frustrations, and they just explode.In this reboot, the warehouse scene is still present...almost in it's entirety...yet we never really understand why Ren needs to explode because he has a fairly supportive Aunt & Uncle, had only one run-in with the law (which the judge dismissed), and even the Principal of the school opts to cut him some slack instead of suspending or expelling him for being caught with drugs! That in a nut shell is what happens pretty regularly in this remake: it is largely faithful to the specifics of the original, but it just never feels right! Even the fight scene climax, which was so effective in the original, looks so sloppy and poorly choreographed in this remake.Wormald is likable...he's about the only reason I haven't given this film a sub-5 score. My advice however is this: if you loved the original, wait for this one to come to DVD, and watch it on that.",5,1,8,14 October 2011
Cloud Atlas," Quite possibly the most unique movie going experience of the last 20 years!!!
","Having never read the book that this film is an adaptation of, I entered 'Cloud Atlas' with no preconceptions of what it should be. I'd read critical reviews that hailed it as great, and others that called it boring.After having seen it, I was stunned: what an absolute gem of a motion picture!!! 'Cloud Atlas' tells six different stories in a completely non-linear way, so if you go to see this, be prepared: you need to pay attention, otherwise you will not enjoy this film. The stories are entwined together, with connecting individuals, histories and even objects that reappear again and again. I'll attempt to summarize all the stories here, but will not be able to list every connection...for that, you have to see the film.Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) is a young lawyer from San Francisco who is abroad, negotiating contracts for his Father in law (Hugo Weaving), when he witnesses a slave (David Gyasi) being whipped, and falls ill from a 'polynesian worm' infection. On the trip back to the USA, he is becoming sicker and sicker, despite receiving treatment from Dr. Henry Goose (Tom Hanks), a physician allegedly familiar with this particular type of malady.Ewing's journals, are later published and partially read by Robert Frobisher (Ben Whislaw), a gifted young musician and grifter who was apparently disowned by his family because he is a homosexual. Hoping to achieve fame and fortune, Robert offers his gifts to renowned composer Vyvyan Arys (Jim Broadbent), while writing faithfully of his hopes and dreams to his dear love, Rufus Sixsmith (James D'Arcy). When Vyvyan asserts his claims to Robert's work by leveraging the mistakes Robert has made in his life, Robert becomes as desperate as Adam had been, and tragically ends his life after finishing his 'Cloud Atlas sextet.' Some 40 years later, an elderly Rufus Sixsmith finds himself trapped in an elevator with Luisa Rey (Halle Berry), a reporter who longs to follow in the footsteps of her Father. Sixsmith attempts to provide Luisa with a report that is suggesting that industry insiders are planning a nuclear disaster, but before he can hand over the report to her, he is assassinated. Luisa realizes that this is the biggest story of her life, but one that could very well get her killed.Some 35 years later, editor Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) has barely had an opportunity to read a manuscript about the adventures of Luisa Rey when he is assailed by the brothers of Dermot Hoggins (Tom Hanks), a writer he represented whose book is now much more successful because he threw a critic off the roof at a party. Turning to his brother Denny (Hugh Grant) for help, he finds himself locked away in a nursing home at the mercy of the vindictive Nurse Noakes (Hugo Weaving), plotting his escape.Over 100 years later, the story of Timothy Cavendish's escape from the nursing home is, for a time, the sole image of the world that fabricant Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) carries with her. Having watched a fellow fabricant die a horrible death after attempting to escape, she finds herself freed by 'pure blood' Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess), who shows her what awaits the fabricants after they fulfil their contracts and are supposed to be free. Hae-Joo believes that Sonmi will change the world for the better.And finally, in a future time, after the fall of civilization, a group of valley people try to live their lives according to the lessons handed down by their God, Sonmi-451. Zachry (Tom Hanks) is haunted by the demon Old Georgie (Hugo Weaving), watching his brother in law and nephew murdered by the violent Kona people. When his niece nearly dies, he enlists the help of other world woman Meronym (Halle Berry) to save her, and agrees to take her to the devil's mountain so that she can fulfil her mission.There is a lot more to this movie than what I've revealed, and although some critics claimed the film's components were pretty thin...I never felt that way at all.Yes, some elements needed more elaboration...particularly how Sonmi-451 went from vacant fabricant to a more evolved being...but I just can't hold that against this film. You're not going to see another film like this in a very long time, so my suggestion would be to get out there and see this one while you can. It's easily the best film I've seen this year, and one of the best I've seen in a very long time!",10,8,16,31 October 2012
