Marie Antoinette," Boo to Ms. Coppola
","This movie is good for background noise and thats about it. Like most people I agree costumes and scenery are beautiful. However, scenes are drawn out and boring, also Coppola did a TERRIBLE adaptation of Antonia Fraser's book. I have never been a fan of Coppola's work and don't think I will be after this. Marie Antoinette's character was poorly constructed. People should know that she was NOT raised to be Queen of France originally her sister was supposed to be Queen but instead was married off to the King of Naples. Antoinette and her sisters had schooling but only that they would be proper in dancing, riding, and other such things. They were not raised to be responsible for the people they would one day rule over. Marie Antoinette in particular was not ... her mother had no interest in her until her other sisters were married off! Coppola had many other things that bothered me including the ending, Marie Antoinette never getting older, and the fact that she had THREE living children NOT two. (She had two sons and one daughter) Bravo Kirstin Dunst and Jason Schwartzman! All though they had a terrible director they did what they could!!!",3,1,6,25 February 2007
