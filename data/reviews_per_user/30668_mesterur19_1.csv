Come and See," Russian propaganda movie
","This is the the most high-concept russian propaganda movie I have ever seen, ehat full with made for the effect scenes. It should be mentioned this movie made in the soviet era, so nobody expect real picture from the soviet or german soldiers! To tell the truth, there ar some true events in it, for example when they burn down the whole village: under the russian withdrawal, Stalin gave the order to burn all the villages down and because they do not want the soviet to hate their whole army, they dressed german uniforms. I can believe this really happened like the film shows.
I do not deny the germans made terrible things in the USSR, but the soviet soldiers did at least terrible or more terrible things, not just the germans but with the nations of the USSR.
Until a movie only shows that one side did horrible things only, it is only an agitation movie!",1,2,13,11 April 2020
