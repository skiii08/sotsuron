Blade Runner 2049," One of the best sequels. Ever.
","OMG what a movie. It's such an awesome sequel and an incredible film. It doesn't diminish the original at all. Nothing gets retcon'd, no mystique is lost. Could they have made a better Blade Runner sequel. No.
So it's a great Blade Runner movie, but is it a great movie? One of the best IMHO. Some will say it's slow and boring, but clearly it's not the movie for them then. Every frame on screen is beautiful and crafted with the utmost care. The music and audio is top notch and matches the movie perfectly. And the performances? Gosling is subdued but that's how his character is. And Ford... OMG one of your best sir. Well done.
Just straight up ignore any review that gives it less than 7/10 - clearly they know nothing about what makes a good movie.
Maybe like me you'll consider it a masterpiece, maybe you'll say 'Yeah, was okay I guess' and give it a 7/10.",10,2,6,29 December 2017
