Scarface," Scarface review
","Scarface (1983) is a classic gangster flick full of suspense, money, and of course guns. Al Pacino plays Tony Montana, a hotheaded Cuban immigrant that climbs the drug business along with his friend Manny. Unlike other gangster films, Tony isn't supported by his family and has no in to the drug industry. The 1983 film is a remake of a past version made in 1932. The 1983 version directed by Brian De Palma is of course more extreme because of the upgrade in special effects and uses more dedicated method actors. Compared to other famous gangster films like The Godfather trilogy (1972-1990), Scarface (1983) is definitely darker and gorier. The movie has all the aspects to fit in the gangster/crime genre. There's the mafia, money, power, the boss and underdog, the damsel in distress, greed, guns, blood, and drugs. De Palma creates suspense with shots like the close up front shots of Tony and the chaotic ringing noise in the background letting us know that he's about to snap and something's about to happen. The lighting in the movie is mostly natural light that's used symbolically (day=innocent night=deception).For example, when it's bright and 'daytime' in a scene everything is normal. Then when the lighting appears to be used to show that its 'night time' that's when all the gangster acts take place. During the final scene, which is also Tony's death scene, we see Tony front on as he is shouting at the top of the staircase. Then as he is shot in the back and killed, the angle switches to us looking down at his body as he falls into the pool. This is very symbolic of his change in power, from low too high to rock bottom. Another staircase angle shot is when Tony comes over to Manny's looking for Gina, only to find her in a robe at the top of the stairs looking down at him and smiling. Being used to a more traditional Italian gangster movie Scarface (1983) was surprising and a little hard to take from the content and blood. Overall it was a classic film with a good story-line, full of some amazing timeless actors/actresses. It's defiantly a movie that leaves you feeling uneasy, without a 'happy ending', and I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in gangster/crime or action flicks. I give it a 7/10.",7,0,3,28 April 2016
Annie Hall," . . . 'Because we NEED the eggs.'
","The 1977 romantic comedy, directed by Woody Allen, will make you laugh and cry at the same time. The film is shot in a way that you feel as though you're there as an onlooker watching Alvy (Woody Allen) and Annie's (Diane Keaton) relationship unfold. The film is from Alvy's (Allen) perspective and we hear and see his own commentary to the camera, breaking the 'fourth wall' during the movie. The story starts with Alvy (Allen) telling us how he can't get over his last girlfriend, Annie Hall (Keaton). We then see their relationship play out, from the first time they meet, to their first break up, to them getting back together, to their last break up. Although the movie doesn't have that standard 'happy ending' where both characters end up back together, I still felt happy knowing that they could stay friends and that not all was lost. The movie is very realistic of modern and past relationship culture. Which leads us to some themes in the plot; love vs lust, city vs country, New York vs LA, woman vs man, and the theme of second chances and mistakes. The film shows the difference between the sexes, but also between the geographic characteristics of a Jewish man from New York and a woman from the Midwest. We see how different living and standards are from the east coast to the west (NY to LA). The film shows us that relationships aren't perfect and neither are people, but that there is always something good in that other person. Allen gives us comic relief throughout the film, and ends with a montage of all the good memories Annie (Keaton) and Alvy (Allen) had shared together. I really enjoyed this film and would defiantly recommend it to anyone into romance or comedy or both. It's a feel good movie that you'll remember for a long time. Rating 9/10",9,0,0,28 April 2016
