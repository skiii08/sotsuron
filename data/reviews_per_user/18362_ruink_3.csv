The Incredible Hulk," A Comic-To-Screen Masterpiece...
","As I had stated in the title of this review this is truly a comic-to-screen masterpiece. I am a religious Incredible Hulk comic reader and fan and it takes a lot for me to be impressed by anything adapted from the Marvel universe. And I am happy to say that this film is nearly perfect on all accounts staying quite faithful to the comics and the classic Bill Bixby live action TV show.The story is pure brilliance and in my opinion was written in such a way that could only work for an Incredible Hulk film to be acceptable and enjoyable to the masses. You may hate me for this but I really don't want to go into great detail about the story because I really don't want to spoil anything pertaining the story because I really want you to be as thrilled and surprised by the story as I was when I first experienced this masterpiece. I promise YOU WILL buy into the story and be absorbed with the characters and will feel a passionate connection with the main love story involving Betty and Bruce. I mean how can you not?LOL.Tee-Hee. Okay joking aside with the whole giggle thing, YOU WILL LOVE THE STORY! PERIOD.In a nutshell this is just a great comic book film for the masses consisting of everything you would want in a general film not just comic book films. Everything works in the film. The special effects, acting, writing, music, and directing. I really love this film and have not met a person who doesn't. Forgive me for not going into a great detailed review but I really don't want to spoil anything or really say anything because this is a great movie going experience that shouldn't be spoiled in the least bit. If you haven't guessed by now I strongly suggest you should see the film.",6,2,3,3 March 2010
Kick-Ass," A Legendary Cinematic Experience.
","Kick-Ass is one the best cinematic experiences I will never forget. Period... Now onto the review!The story of Kick-Ass is quite simple yet extremely original that makes for a fantastic movie going experience. The film takes the concept of a Bruce Wayne, or a Tony Stark esquire concept and projects it in a literal form. It asks the question: what would happen if an average Joe...or teenager in this case would pose as a masked vigilante and decide to fight crime? The main character in this film, High School comic book geek Dave, played by the wonderful Aaron Johnson, decides to put this question to the test and decides to pose as Kick-Ass. His motive for this task as I said before is to answer the inevitable question and decides to stand up to crime when other people don't. When taking on the responsibility of Kick-Ass he finally gets a chance to fight crime against three hoodlums. When fighting them a crowd is gathered around a fight filming Kick Ass with their camera phones, Youtube Gear what have you. This video of Kick Ass fighting crime causes a Youtube sensation and gains much popularity. Little dos Kick Ass know though, that he has just entered a realm of other masked vigilantes. These other crime fighters are Big Daddy played in prime form by Mr. Nick Cage. And Big Daddy's daughter Hit Girl, which is a surreal performance by the new young comer Chloe Moretz. These two vigilantes have a mission themselves to stop a local Drug Lord in town played by Mark Strong(whom by the way is the main villain) who Bigg Daddy has personal beef with. Something i wont spoil. Oh and how could I forget the hilarious Red Mist played by the charming Mclov'n himself, Chris Mintz Plasse. All these characters and stories tie in a very clever manner that is blast to sit through.So what do you get with Kick-Ass? A movie that in my opinion is one of the only movies I have ever seen to coming close to perfection. Call my boasting propaganda but I seriously have no complaints here. This film has essentially everything that makes a film enjoyable; great directing, great writing, great acting, and memorable characters. Sure the story has no real deep intellectual moral behind it aside from telling to stand for others when others don't, but it's how this story is told about a few characters whom we come to love and care about. We care about their actions and we feel connected to them. Vaughn has somehow grounded this film in reality yet takes us on a journey larger than life. And succeeds in doing so. So in summary what is Kick-Ass? It is simply put the best super-hero movie ever made if not one of the best movies ever made in general. Period.",9,7,15,15 July 2010
Despicable Me," 'Despicable Me' juxtapose to 'Toy Story 3'
","'Despicable Me' is centered around main character Gru voiced by a foreign sounding Steve Carell. Gru's main intention or only intention in life shall I say is to become the world's most renowned super-villain. His plan to achieve this status? Pull off the most insane heist known to man of course, steal the moon. But being the slouch Gru is, Gru must defeat his arch enemy Vector voiced by an underwhelming Jason Segal. Seeking help for his heist, Gru decides that adopting three orphan girls will be the missing ingredient to his heist. Will Gru pursue his evil plan, or will he eventually have a change of heart for the three little orphan girls?Of course being an animated film, characters need a voice to give them soul, right? Of course they do, let's not be silly! Steve Carell voicing the lead character Gru is probably the only thing this film has going for it. His accent is so goofy that you just buy it and roll with it. His delivery as always is spot on, making even the weakest of jokes seem funny. So in summary Steve Carell does exceptional work here. I wish I could compliment the rest of the cast here which is a disappointment considering the film has such an expansive cast of comedians. As I said earlier, Jason Segal as Gru's enemy Vector is extremely underwhelming. His voice is both annoying and conventional almost seeming like a knock off of Mandark on 'Dexter's Laboratory'. Also the fact that majority of the potty jokes were handed to Segal doesn't help either. Danny Mcbride voices Gru's neighbor, a character that has no impact whatsoever to the major story line. Such talent should have not been wasted on such a minor position. 'Get Him to the Greek's' Russell Brand probably does the most tolerable work next to Steve Carrell as Dr. Nefario, Gru's right hand man. But even this performance isn't a standout.Perhaps what made the voice acting disappointing to me were the lines the actors had to read. Majority of the dialogue here resorts to toilet humor. It would have been okay if only some 5% of the jokes stooped down to this just to please the kids but when a whole movie's gags are based around this it becomes incomprehensibly annoying. Doing this really creates a barrier for likable character development. Sure the film is a cartoon, thus creating a world and characters larger than life but with clever writing even a rock can become a character in which you connect with.So maybe I was a bit spoiled with the animated masterpiece 'Toy Story 3' that came out last month but seeing 'Despicable Me' helped me realize something. It helped me realize why Pixar's movies work so well and other animated movies fall short of their glory. It's because above all else, story comes first. Not the voice talent, not the jokes, not the slapstick, but the main ingredient that makes any film in general enjoyable: the story. Pixar makes sure that everything is serviced to the story and not by it's minor counterparts. Contrary to 'Despicable Me', it relies on it's gags and it's star talent. This is something if any film in general relies on it fails. May lessons be learned.",6,2,8,15 July 2010
