Requiem for a Dream," Can anyone answer this question?
","Firstly i love the film, much better than the other drug movies like trainspotting, spun , blow and scarface, but some bits i don't get with requiem. Like the shooting in the car. Apart from Tyrone who are the other dudes. (aNGEL?) Whos the white driver. Whats with the white driver shooting the muted bloke. Basically whats that scene gotta do with the rest of the film? ALso does anyone know why the film is called Requiem for a dream. OK the dream bit is obvious, but requiem?, don't know.oh ad what the hell is that gameshow all about. is that a real show. whats with the word juice. I'm not getting it. what actually happened to her application. why was it never sent back. was she too messed up to realise.",9,0,1,28 December 2005
