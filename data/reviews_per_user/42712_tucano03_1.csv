The Incredible Hulk," Incredible.... 'N'uff Said!'
","Finally, a film that measures up to the great character the Hulk is! Various cameo appearances. Lots of details for fans to get excited. Acceptable adaptations of the story and the best looking effects I could have imagined. Edward Norton was a great choice to play as Bruce B. - the main character - which is a really rare thing in comic's super hero movies. Edward is capable of showing the depth the character has, even if the scrip simplifies Banner's choices a little. Unlike the first movie, this one nailed it. While I don't know what happened to the first 'Hulk' that, in spite of the great actors is really what i consider one of the worse movies I've ever seen, followed closely by Batman and Robin, 'The Incredible Hulk' measures up to it's name... Incredible! Simply a must have. One of the best comics super-hero movies there is, if not the best!",10,2,6,14 June 2008
