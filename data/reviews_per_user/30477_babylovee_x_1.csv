National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Worth It.
","I honestly don't write these things but I thought I had to write one since a lot of people are saying this movie didn't 'live up' to the first one or it wasn't as fun or WHATEVER. Personally, I liked this movie. I thought it was entertaining, it was worth my 10 bucks and it was well-made. It was pretty similar to the 1st one but you got to give the producers a hand. Not anybody can make up ideas like the 'President's Book of Secrets' and the clues were interestingly - especially in the first one. I got to say that I did like the 1st one a lot better but NT2 was enjoyable. This movie does teach you a lot about history. And not in the boring way, either. They just state a historical fact and you sort of remember it after, from there on. Plus, I simply love Nic Cage! I think he's a great actor and he made this movie work, as well as the other characters. Jon Voight was a good choice for the father and I'm glad they kept most of the characters from NT1. So, if your planning on watching this movie, I assure you, it'll be worth it. There might be a few flaws here and there but you watch a movie to get entertained, don't you? Nd this certainly was an entertaining movie.",8,0,2,26 December 2007
