Catch Me If You Can," On my top ten of 2002
","*****Warning******SPOILERS AHEAD******WARNING****SPOILERSSpielberg does a fine job crafting this smart and true tale from the opening title scene, even throughout the spotty ending (I wish I could have seen the rest of the cut...even if it took 3 hours....I'm sure they'll be some Special Edition DVD out in the future).  DiCaprio's character was well done, although at times I thought a bit young for the role he was portraying. Walken was genuine, truly deserving of the Academy nod.  Hanks was believable as Hanratty, but not really a change up for him in terms of roles.  The scene at Miami International signifies both the high water point and downfall of this, although I found some of the finale in the FBI interesting I'd like to know what happened when he escaped and was caught in Europe.  Guess I'll have to read the book for that...",8,1,2,18 February 2003
Amadeus," One of the top ten of the last 20 years
","*****Warning****Spoilers AHEAD**********WARNING*************Milos Forman's does not make many movies, and when he does, he does so in unique and stylish fashion.  This film is certainly unique, and I'd say at times divine, at times very human, and connects with the very fiber that unites all of us.  First, our failed quest for greatness has rarely been seen as vividly as through the eyes of Solieri, who was recognized by his government as the finest musician of his time, but knew in his heart that his talent was only miniscule to that of the great Mozart.  F. Murray Abraham does an extraordinary job with this, and so does Tom Hulce portraying Mozart's flambouyant persona.  The music is top notch, as to be expected, especially the haunting finale where Hulce is singing the notes to his work as Solieri is writing.  Note -- I'm commenting from the Director's cut DVD which is rated R.  I understand the PG rated version is short of the scene where she strips.  I kind of like that scene in the movie...I think it shows her will and makes her disappointment at the end understandable.  I did find this cut a little long...I haven't watched the original...maybe that one is perfect...but this is about as close as you get.",9,2,4,18 February 2003
