The Ring," A good movie if you're willing to turn your brain off.
","***Spoilers: If you have not seen the movie, you shouldn't be reading this*** Overall, 'The Ring' was a fantastic movie, mainly because out of the limited number of horror movies I have seen in my life, this one actually managed to scare me. All the creepy little details are perfectly done, and it also has some great shock moments (the scene with Rachel's body in the closet made me jump about a foot). The tape itself is very mysterious and disturbing, and is, in my opinion, the best part of the movie.However, there were several things that were rather dumb, and the more I thought about them after I watched it, the more I didn't like it. It's the kind of movie that you can't analyze too much, or you'll ruin it for yourself. For one thing, the entire premise of combining supernatural mysticism with VHS technology is a bit goofy. But what really turned me off about this one was the kid, Aiden.Aiden drove me crazy. I'm supposed to feel scared for him, and yet he spends the entire movie looking like he's about to wet his pants. He's a shaking, bug-eyed, dippy little nerd. All kids in horror flicks are like this, too (The Sixth Sense, The Shining, Invaders From Mars, etc.), and I'm sick of it. I want to see a horror where the kid stands up for himself like a man. Maybe then I'd care about whether the ghost gets him or not. Nervous outcasts like Aiden just annoy me. If I had a kid like him, I'd LET the ghost get him. After all, if he's not gutsy enough to protect himself from a stupid ghost like Samara, he probably wasn't going to last long anyway.This brings me to my second point: Samara the ghost was indeed stupid. Yes, everything was creepy and suspenseful, until we find out the exact method she uses to kill her victims, namely, crawling out of the TV and... looking at them. What the heck!? How hard can it be to defeat her?? All you have to do is unplug your TV. If you're not swift enough to do that, then just run away! She can't catch you, because she happens to be the slowest-moving ghost of all time.This is why I got so mad at that guy Noah at the end. All he had to do was LEAVE THE DAMN ROOM, but this proved to be too hard a task for him. Samara's inching toward him with these teeny-tiny baby steps, and this guy decides to start falling over and crashing into things like one of the Three Stooges. What a moron. If he's so uncoordinated that he can't walk ten feet without tripping all over himself, then he probably wouldn't have lived long anyway, either.Well, if you can handle the unintended silliness of the plot and characters, and focus on the well-done atmosphere and details, then you will enjoy this movie. Just don't think about it too hard.",8,2,4,13 December 2004
The Girl Next Door," Idiotic movie for idiots
","I have to admit, when I finished watching this, I was not entirely sure if I had seen a good or a bad movie. I thought maybe the incoherent, surreal, nonsensical lack of a story was intentional, that maybe this was multilayered and deep and I missed the symbolism or something. I thought about it for a good, long, hard 10 seconds, then decided that no, it was just trash. I mean, sometimes it can take hard work to make a movie this weird, but I'm pretty sure this was by accident.Let me put it to you this way: if you were amused by the phrase 'long, hard 10 seconds' in the above paragraph, you will think this movie is a classic. Actually, no, you probably won't. You will be disappointed because there is no nudity. That's right: a movie about porn stars and the porn industry, and that condones porn as a good thing, has NO NUDITY. What the hell kind of message is THAT sending? I'm not even going to bother explaining the plot, because there is none. There's about a thousand different climaxes (haha, I said climaxes), and the movie contradicts its own attitude toward porn even more times than that. If you can make sense out of this mess, consider yourself a genius (or an idiot. I'm not sure).Other users have mentioned the movie's depiction of Asians is 'borderline racist.' I think the word they're looking for is 'downright,' not borderline. Here's a true story: when I was 12, I started taking a tally on how many American comedies attempt to get laughs out of minorities swearing in goofy accents. Including this movie, that number has now surpassed 5 trillion (and the only time it has ever been funny was in 'Office Space'). Anyway, if you think an Asian kid wearing huge glasses and talking like Elmer Fudd is high comedy, this is the movie for you. If, however, you are not a racist dumbass, you'll want to avoid 'The Girl Next Door,' and stick to something a little more watchable, like 'Manos: Hands of Fate.'",1,6,15,28 December 2005
Spider-Man 2," Enjoyable but stupid.
","***Caution: Spoilers All Over the Place*** So Doctor Otto Octavius is going to demonstrate real live fusion to a small audience. To do this, he needs to attach himself to a set of strong, flexible, and artificially intelligent mechanical arms.These arms have nothing to do with the actual fusion, but he still needs them because they... you know... move around, and help him somehow or other.Unfortunately, the experiment gets out of control and he fuses the arms to his spine, causing them to (somehow or other) take over his brain. These arms feel bad about the failed fusion experiment, and they want to try again. They want to have a really, really BIG fusion experiment. God only knows WHY four mechanical arms should be so passionate about fusion, but they are.And that's how most of this movie is. Like the arms, it's pretty sweet to watch, but it's also extremely dumb, and you just have to forget about that in order to enjoy the movie. This is pretty hard, though, because there are a LOT of dumb things to forget about, such as Spiderman losing his powers because of self-doubt (huh?), approximately 70 people seeing him without his mask on and promising to keep it a secret (yup), etc. I personally had a hard time with all this dumbness, but of course it's a blockbuster superhero movie, so I should probably just shut up and enjoy it. It does have some great stuff in it: I loved the action sequences, as well as the good drama and acting (I disagree that Kirsten Dunst is a bad actress)... but I still walked out of the theater thinking, MAN that was dumb.6/10 stars.",Null,0,0,6 July 2004
Elf," Pretty darn good!
","This movie was really very funny. The beginning scenes, with Will Ferrell living in the North Pole with other elves, was a bit corny, and I was wondering where exactly this movie was going. Fortunately, it went in exactly the right direction, and it had some fantastic comedic moments. Ferrell is hilarious as a hyper, super-polite elf who has no idea how to act in the human world. He is fascinated by glowing elevator buttons, terrified by an escalator, amazed at the size of human toilets, and basically awed by everything that normal people take for granted. The supporting characters are good too (especially Bob Newhart, who delivers all the goofy narration with a deadpan straight face), but Ferrell steals the show. He is a riot. I truly believe this movie could become a classic Christmas film. I could not help but like it, even though it was a little on the hokey side. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a fast, funny movie that anyone can enjoy. I give 'ELF' 8 out 10 stars. Now, go see it.",8,0,1,9 November 2003
The Shining," A major disappointment.
","This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.What we have here, however, is a documentary on the most dysfunctional family in the world. Isn't this supposed to be about a loving husband and father who goes insane? Jack Nicholson is brilliant at portraying total insanity, but there's no gradual shift into at all. He looks like he's about to snap from scene one. His wife is a whimpering, nervous wreck who does not seem to trust him at any point throughout the movie. And the kid, Danny, is just a weird little nut. Who can identify with these people?Another major problem is that there is no clear storyline here. The whole first half of the movie is about the kid's psychic abilities, and then it does a total switch and focuses on Jack Nicholson being crazy. What was the point of spending all that time on Danny? It seems like it is foreshadowing something, but it never amounts to anything. I guess Danny is the first one to see ghosts in the house, but that is not a big enough plot point to spend the entire first half of the movie on.Other than some incredibly creepy music and sets, there is nothing really scary in this movie. It is fun to see Jack Nicholson ham it up, of course, but there is no scariness involved when you spend the entire movie waiting listlessly for him to pick up an ax, rather than being shocked when he goes from lovable to psychotic. Instead, he goes from obviously-wanting-to-release-a-ton-of-built-up-aggression to psychotic, which is extremely inferior.6/10 stars, and that is being generous.",6,33,59,12 September 2004
The Exorcist," Wow... what a bad movie.
","Having looked over the other user comments, I see there are some definite patterns in how people react to this movie. Religious people think it is horrifying, agnostic people think it is creepy, and atheist people think it is hilarious. But I really can't figure out the people who say it's scary because of its 'subtlety.' How on earth is vomiting, head twisting, levitation, and masturbation subtle? This movie is intended to shock and offend, not scare. I mean, a 'subtle' possession movie would have the demon murmuring in a low, unearthly voice, not shrieking like the Incredible Hulk. Everything is just too over-the-top.There are parts that are pretty sick and twisted, but nothing really scary. It didn't take me long to figure out that this is nothing but shock schlock. I didn't find it as funny as some people do (although the pea soup vomit was rather amusing), but I did find it disappointing, insulting, and irritating.4/10 stars.",4,27,57,31 October 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Pretty campy.
","***Spoilers Ahead, Watch Where You Step***I did not particularly want to see this movie, but I went with my friend, who was born with a tragic genetic defect that makes him like stuff like this. However, our opinions on this movie were pretty much the same: it's actually quite entertaining at first (you gotta love those awesome steel weapons the Predators use), but the last third of the movie gets unbelievably goofy. I mean, the last thing you expect in a monster movie is for the lead human character to befriend the monster. But she does, and at that point it almost turns into a buddy movie. In fact, the human is almost tougher than the actual Predator! She was outrunning him there at the end! What's that about!?Another nitpick I have with this movie is that it's taking place in Antarctica--aka THE ARCTIC--and everyone is dressed like it's late August in Duluth. The ending of the movie finds the heroine standing there alone in the middle of the tundra without a coat or hat. Did anyone consider that after her adrenaline rush goes away, she'll probably freeze to death? Oh well. Movies like this don't tend to make a lot of sense, so why bother complaining about logic. I'll give it 5/10 stars just for those cool weapons.",5,0,0,27 August 2004
Meet the Fockers," Should have been good
","This should have been a spectacular movie. Think about it: you have Hoffman and De Niro, who were practically gods at one time, playing a washed-up hippie and a washed-up warmonger, coming together for their children's wedding, like a self-referential, super satirical version of 'You Can't Take it With You.' That's what it should have been. Instead, it's a complete mess. I don't even know how to describe this movie. It goes on for what seems like five hours, during which a bunch of stuff happens, and none of it is funny. Ben Stiller stands around giving that stupid pucker-faced wrinkly-eyebrowed expression he uses in every damn one of his movies, and whines. Blythe Danner wanders around saying her only line--'Oh, Jack'--over and over again. Teri Polo stands in the background without doing anything. A baby swears and points at breasts. A dog humps things. A foreskin falls in a fondue pot. On and on and on. I hate this movie. I can't figure out if Hoffman and De Niro were trying to get recognized again, if they just wanted a few extra bucks, or if they're just plain going senile. Whatever the case, it's a sad waste of talent, and a sad movie. 0/10 stars.",1,1,1,13 November 2005
The Incredibles," Good, but not Pixar's best.
","It was funny, it was clever, it was exciting, the animation was truly Incredible, but I still don't think this stacks up well to Pixar's other offerings. While all their films are impressive, I think Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc. set the bar (mainly because they can hold their own next to any live action film, which you can't say for a lot of animated stuff). I was expecting 'The Incredibles' to match the perfection of those two, but it fell short. It is pretty predictable and unoriginal. Plus, although it has a fun, light-weight atmosphere to it, it wasn't quite as funny as I expected. In fact, it had some rather dry moments (the mother's long speech to her daughter reminded me of the smarmy life lesson at the end of every 'Full House' episode). I'm not really complaining, however. I had a blast watching it. The animation is their best yet (during the island sequences, if you took out the cartoon characters and just focused on the backgrounds, you would think you were looking at a real setting). The cast is great, too--both the characters themselves, and the voices behind them (Craig T. Nelson happens to be one of my favorite actors, and it's good to finally see him in a high-budget big screen flick again). All in all, it is another impressive movie from a VERY impressive company... but it still hasn't matched their own standard.8/10 stars.",Null,0,1,14 November 2004
Men in Black," Smart, funny spoof that is impossible not to like!
","'Men in Black' and 'Galaxy Quest' are in my mind the best sci-fi comedies ever made, because they are both hilarious parodies of two different cultures. Whereas the latter spoofed obsessed fans who take sci-fi entertainment WAY too seriously, this one spoofs the paranoid, tin-foil-hat brand of conspiracy theorists. It has funny characters, witty lines, and does not at all take itself seriously.There are a lot of small details that can take multiple viewings to catch. One thing I found funnier the second time I watched it is the scene where Will Smith has just been severely lectured by his boss in the interrogation room when Tommy Lee Jones enters, asks a few questions, and tells Smith to come with him. Smith: 'I can't, there's still a lot of paperwork to fill out.' Jones: 'No, the paperwork is all taken care of.' Smith's boss (walking by): 'Hey, nice work, Edwards!' This is one of many quick, funny scenes that you only really get if you're paying attention.All the actors do a good job, too. I thought Rip Torn was the funniest character, and Edgar the bug was hilariously gross. Linda Fiorentino was one of the coolest female characters ever. She put Ripley to shame. Every time I watch this, I want to marry her.Overall, it's a great comedy that is clever and fun all the way through. 8/10 stars.",8,98,116,11 December 2004
The Graduate," Dated, weak.
","Very funny movie that, underneath the humor, has nothing important to say. Stuff like this and 'Harold and Maude' was probably very meaningful to depressed upper class hippies, but today it's just plain irritating. The parts about uncertain futures and love conquering all are still relevant; nothing else is. I suppose, for example, Dustin Hoffman's act of pursuing Elaine out of spite after ONE lousy date was defiant and cool in the 60's, but today it just seems... strange, to put it mildly. And while Hoffman is great at looking nervous and confused, his character has no real personality. I don't hate this movie: the first forty minutes are a blast, and the ending is a delight. But the majority of it is just empty and irrelevant today. Maybe it's important for defining the period, but if I'm going to watch a movie, I'd like to get something out of it.",5,5,13,30 October 2005
There's Something About Mary," Boring and stupid
","This movie is horrible. People lie and say they like it because of its supposed 'shock' value, but the truth is, gross-out humor is nothing new, and it has been done MUCH better than this (just watch any episode of 'South Park'). The only funny scene is the one in the police station, but by then I was too tired and bored to laugh. A couple other scenes have good comic potential, such as the dog on speed, but they are wasted and fall flat.Even with the horrible script, which has no tangible plot and can't figure out who the main character is and doesn't bother to develop characters at all, it COULD have been funny with the right actors (this is what saved 'Dumb and Dumber'). Unfortunately, everyone here is bland and listless. I guess I'll make an exception for Lee Evans, who really is a talented comedian and does his best with an unfunny character. But Stiller and Dillon don't even seem to be trying that hard. Diaz doesn't even have personality; she's nothing more than a plot device. Except there is no plot. So I don't know what she is. Just a device, I guess.I can't believe I spent money to rent this. Fortunately I also had the good sense to rent 'The Big Lebowski' along with it, so my evening wasn't completely ruined. Still, I could have saved myself two hours of pain and boredom.",4,1,2,5 September 2005
Saw," Not the best, but certainly not the worst.
","I never intended to see this, but when it came on TV at 12:30 am, I decided what the heck. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's a campy B-movie, with a lot of unintentionally funny stuff (it seemed like Whannell and Elwes were having a contest to see who could be the worst actor of the century), but it is creative enough to make you forget all that. The idea of these people being put in situations where they have no choice but to kill themselves is very imaginative, as is the killer's motivation (making them grateful to be alive). And I usually can see twists coming from miles away, but the horrifying ending took me completely by surprise. If you can get past the cheesiness, and just admire the script's creativity, it is an entertaining thriller that sticks with you long after you've watched it.",7,1,2,7 March 2005
National Treasure," Enjoyable hour and a half.
","OK, when the main character's name is Benjamin Franklin Gates, you know this is not a movie to be taken too seriously. And yes, this one has obviously gotten a LOT of inspiration from 'The Davinci Code' (as well as just about every treasure hunt/heist movie ever made), but it still is fun and enjoyable on its own. In fact, I thought this was a great movie--it's interesting, exciting, and suspenseful from start to finish. It also had some pretty funny lines, and to top it off, Diane Kruger is one amazingly beautiful woman!Just a few things bugged me. For instance, I can't imagine the Declaration of Independence can be tossed around like that. When Nick Cage started rolling it up like a cheap poster, I wanted to shout at the screen, 'CAREFUL, you idiot!' I really don't know how durable the thing is, but still. Plus, the grease and oil from all those people touching it with their bare hands can't be too good.Also, how come, right when they need to drop lemon juice on it to read the invisible map, Jon Voight's character just happens to have about a dozen lemons on hand? This REALLY bugged me. No sane person would have that many lemons in their house. Barring some kind of lemon fetish, I would guess the average person goes through about two a year.Small details aside though, this is a very enjoyable flick that is worth seeing in theaters. You won't be disappointed.8/10 stars.",Null,1,1,27 November 2004
Die Hard," Altogether perfect... my favorite movie
","For my 100th review on IMDb.com, I have decided to go with my all-time favorite movie, 'Die Hard.' It is, in my mind, the greatest action movie ever made, and also one of the best movies ever made, period. Its only purpose is to entertain, and entertain it does, without a single dull moment from start to finish. It flies along at a lightning pace, the pyrotechnics and stunts are amazing, and the entire cast shines. McTiernan takes full advantage of the setting, and there is a genuine feeling of claustrophobia and heart-pounding suspense when McClane is sneaking around in the vents and elevator shafts.Direction aside, even the script itself is cleverly written, with a lot of humor thrown in, and interesting, well-thought-out plot twists (such as McClane taking off his shoes in the beginning, only to seriously regret it later on). It was also a stroke of genius on the screenwriter's part to have it take place during Christmas, ensuring that it would become a perennial classic.It has been criticized, of course, for being full of clichés, but the fact is, no other action movie has handled those clichés as well as this one. It set the standard for action movies, and since then very few have even come close. 'Die Hard' is a nonstop thrill, and all in all the most wildly entertaining movie I have ever seen. 10/10 stars.",10,4,5,12 April 2005
Army of Darkness," Am I the only one in the world who didn't like this movie?
","First, let me say I knew EXACTLY what I was getting into when I rented this. I love Bruce Campbell, and I love camp, and the idea of Bruce Campbell taking on campy skeletons while spouting off campy one-liners was too great to pass up. And it certainly has its moments: the free-falling car in the beginning is classic, and Bruce is too cool for school kicking demon butt with his sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw, while being an arrogant jerk to the villagers he's helping.Yes, those parts are all good. But there's FAR TOO LITTLE of them. Half of the movie is just some screwed up Saturday morning cartoon! I was hoping to see Ash being a badass and killing monsters the whole time, but instead I had to sit through this slapstick humor that seems to be aimed at 5-year-olds. Honestly, for all you die-hard fans of this movie, is it THAT entertaining to see Bruce fighting with 4-inch-tall versions of himself? Is it THAT entertaining to see him being attacked by a flying book? There was too much goofy and childish stuff going on, and I sure didn't expect that from a movie about a guy with a chainsaw for a hand. It has a few redeeming qualities, but I was mostly disappointed.",7,2,5,2 April 2005
Die Hard with a Vengeance," They should have quit while they were ahead
","Some people seem to have the idea that 'Die Hard 3' is the best in the series. Some clarification is needed here, because it's actually the worst. It starts out on the right note with an interesting premise (mysterious stranger toying with John for unknown reasons), but at the halfway point, right about the time we actually see the villain, it gets so sloppy it's almost as if they're improvising the plot as they go. I'm too tired to go through all the things wrong with it, but suffice it to say the villain seems to have more people working for him than the entire New York City police department.The main downfall of this one is that McTiernan got confused and thought he was making a 'Lethal Weapon' movie. Someone really should have mentioned to him that he was supposed to be making 'Die Hard,' but too late he pulled in Sam L. Jackson as a store owner with absolutely no reason or motivation of any kind to be helping McClane. He's just there to yell a lot and cause racial tension. The awesome lone-wolf formula from the first two movies becomes the overused, irritating buddy-cop formula (only Jackson's not a cop, just some random black guy). Jackson is a great actor, but his character has no real place in this movie.Add some sub-par acting and an ending so abrupt it's almost like the screenwriter just gave up, and the result is a total wash. I'm not saying it's terrible--it has its moments--but it's nowhere near as good as the first one. I understand they're making a fourth one. I don't have high hopes for it. They should have quit while they were ahead.",5,4,10,7 September 2005
The Terminal," An excellent movie, that gets kind of weird after awhile.
","Some people are complaining that 'The Terminal' was terrible because it didn't make an ounce of sense. It's true, the whole concept of 'logic' has been done away with in this movie, but I don't think the basic idea to begin with is crap... the actual story that it's based on is almost more unrealistic than the movie (Marhan Nasseri was given the chance to leave the Charles de Gaulle airport several times, but he didn't want to).So, it starts out fine... Tom Hanks is a scared tourist lost in a huge airport, and he can't leave. It was fun to watch him learning how to live in the airport on his own, kind of like a modern Robinson Crusoe.At some point, though, the movie starts going in another direction, with Hanks befriending the staff, and becoming some sort of cult hero in the airport. This is the point when the movie goes completely bonkers, because things happen that have no rational explanation. In fact, the whole reason Hanks came to America to begin with turns out to be a little shaky. The whole last third of the movie was like a dream.But even with the psychotic storyline, all the actors give great performances, and that is what makes this an excellent movie. It is all about the characters; they hold the movie up from start to finish.I thought it was very entertaining. 7/10 stars.",Null,1,1,21 June 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," The Grand Guignol meets the Keystone Kops.
","(EDIT: I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote this review. Just ignore it. I'll update it someday. This is a fantastic movie. My comments about the police force still stand, though.)I think I will cover the things I liked about this film first, since it is a very short list:--Jodie Foster's performance. She is very believable and deserved her Oscar. --Ted Levine's performance. He is undoubtedly one of the sickest, most twisted villains to ever appear on screen, and, in my opinion, a lot more scary than Hannibal.--The scene where Foster is being stalked by Buffalo Bill in his house. Now THAT was scary. It is a classic suspense scene.Now, the things I did NOT like:--Anthony Hopkins' performance. Too grandiose and over-the-top; not anywhere near realistic. Everyone talks about what a fantastic performance he gives, but I think if you NOTICE what great acting someone is doing, then they're probably overacting. Plus, his character comes across as being actually likable... a guy you'd like to sit and chat with. He is not scary, just mildly interesting. He apparently has superpowers, too, since he manages to pull off the most unrealistic jailbreak of all time. I don't know how he found the time to even THINK of a scheme like that, much less actually do it. He outwits the entire police force, which brings me to my next point...--The total incompetence of the FBI. I'm not sure whether this was intentional or not, but it was ridiculous and borders on parody. The fact that a rookie like Foster is assigned to the case is unrealistic enough, but then she manages to crack the case All By Herself when she discovers a key piece of information: Buffalo Bill knew his victims. NO WAY!! My God, the girl is a genius! No other investigator with years of experience under their belt could figure this out, but Foster the rookie had a brainstorm and outdid them all. The local police are even worse. They are shown as a bunch of inept morons. During the jailbreak sequence, if it wasn't for all the human mutilation and whatnot, you'd think you were watching an episode of 'Reno 911.' And finally...--The movie is sick. Sick, sick, sick. Little sympathy is shown for the victims, and it feels like the movie is not showing these bizarre killings as a portrait of serial killers (otherwise they might have included actual motivations for Bill and Hannibal), but just for the sake of being disgusting. It's shock theater, plain and simple. I said I liked Ted Levine's performance, but his scenes were still unpleasant to watch. I doubt most people exited the theater thinking, 'Well, that was a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a psychopath,' but more likely, 'WOW! Hannibal chewed a guy's face off! COOL!' Really, what's the point? All the scenes with Hannibal feel more like a movie script than anything that could happen in real life. A realistic portrayal of a cannibalistic psycho would have been scary, but the majority of this movie, save for a few great scenes, is just corny and gross.",8,1,4,3 January 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Has some cool ideas, but doesn't really amount to anything.
","The best part about this movie is the whole idea that sleep can kill you in a horrible and gory fashion. Once that is established, Craven does an excellent job of making normally comforting settings such as a soft bed or a warm bubble bath seem menacing. Never before has falling asleep seemed so scary, and it gets better and better as Nancy tries to come up with a solution before she goes crazy from lack of sleep, while surviving on coffee and caffeine pills. It has a very interesting suspense to it. There is also the nicely done part where they try to apply cold hard science to Nancy's problem ('Something's wrong, the numbers are never this high!'). Very cool.Those are the good parts. The bad parts are the lame acting (excluding Johnny Depp) and the laziness of the script. It really, really hurts this movie that so little attention is paid to the parents. They are barely even IN the movie, even though the entire premise revolves around them! The backstory about these seemingly nice parents, in a quiet suburban town, viciously killing a man (child murderer or not), and keeping it a big town secret, is a neat idea that is just briefly mentioned like an afterthought ('Oh, by the way honey, all of us parents burned a man to death when you were a kid. Now go to bed, OK?'). The implication is that Freddie is getting revenge on the people who killed him by murdering their innocent children, but it's not explained or developed at all. Why is he coming back NOW, for instance? Why not earlier? And why in the world do Nancy's parents completely ignore her? If you murdered a guy years ago, and then your kid, who knows nothing about it, provides an exact description of him in her dreams, wouldn't you think there was something a bit odd going on? It would have been much cooler if they had realized Freddie was killing their kids, and there's nothing they could do about it.I also hate the ending to this movie. Why do horror movies always have to have such bizarro endings? The climactic battle at the end is awesome, but then it takes such a weird turn--(and I'm not even including the nutty twist here, I'm talking about the father NOT CARING that his wife just got sucked into a bed by a demon!)--that it totally runs out of steam and turns into a horrible, nonsensical train wreck. Roll credits.If the movie focused more on the parents, and had a decent ending, it would have been a true classic. Instead, it is a mediocre slasher flick with a few interesting elements, which is a real shame.",7,12,17,17 February 2005
Aladdin," Not that good, actually...
","I don't consider this a Disney 'classic.' I consider it the exact point where Disney started going downhill, and they have yet to come back up (with the exception of 'The Lion King,' which was great). It is worth noting for the early computer animation, and the excellent voice work by Robin Williams, Gilbert Gottfried, Frank Welker, and Jonathan Freeman, but on the whole, this is nothing but a big Saturday morning cartoon. For one thing, the 2-D artwork is absolute crap. The characters look like they're off of cereal boxes, and even the backgrounds are shoddy. The animation is technically very good, but good animation isn't all that impressive if the characters are crudely drawn to begin with. Compare this to stuff like, say, 'Pinocchio' to see the huge difference in effort and talent on the artists' part.For another thing, the songs in this one are horrible. Sure, the tunes are catchy, but has anyone taken time to listen to those LYRICS? 'Arabian nights/ Like Arabian days/ More often than not/ Are hotter than hot/ In a lot of good ways.' Wow, incredible. And how about this moving line: 'Would they see a poor boy? No siree. They'd find out there's so much more to me.' Seriously... 'no siree'!? I can't believe people get paid to write junk like that.Add the fact that Aladdin and Jasmine, our main characters, are bland and unlikeable, and you have a really bad movie. I remember loving this movie when I saw it in theaters as a kid, but there was a time when Disney movies didn't lose their charm after you turned 13. With the start of movies like 'Aladdin,' that time is long gone.",5,5,21,25 March 2005
Sin City," There are better ways to spend your evening
","First of all, I have never read any of Frank Miller's stuff, but I knew exactly what I was going in for when I bought the ticket. I knew it was going to be gory and sadistic. My problem wasn't even with the violence (not that I liked it; if you are honestly ENTERTAINED by seeing a guy getting his limbs sawn off and eaten by a dog, you have problems, my friend). And for the record, there were parts I liked. Mickey Rourke's character was awesome beyond words, and each of the three main stories had its moments (the dominatrix women of Old Town, the Bruce Willis hanging scene, etc.). But for some reason, I just couldn't enjoy it. It felt like there was something missing. In fact, the whole thing seemed mediocre.I guess the missing ingredient, now that I think about it, was Camp with a capital C. This type of relentless gore is usually done either to make you laugh or to make you throw up, but here it is apparently done to impress, and that just doesn't work. Seeing a guy's head still being alive after getting decapitated is very silly in a 'Re-Animator' sort of way, but here it is done with a weird solemnity that I guess is supposed to shock or get a 'wow, cool' reaction out of the audience. They should have played up the silliness factor (or just gone all out and turned it into full-blown exploitation, in which case I wouldn't have gone). There were touches of campiness, cheesiness, and silliness (especially in the badass narration), but NOT ENOUGH for a movie like this. It's just a lot of gritty violence that gets VERY repetitive after awhile (along with the visuals--yes, they're cool, but the blotches of color were making my head spin).It's not over-the-top enough to be exploitation, it's not campy enough to be 'Evil Dead 2,' it's not self-parodying enough to be 'Commando,' and it's not even fun enough to be 'Kill Bill.' In the end, it doesn't go far enough in any direction to really be much of anything. It's really just two hours of sadism.And finally, let me say the one thing that was on my mind the entire time: if Basin City is such a hellhole, how come it never occurs to the characters to just hop in a car and LEAVE? Why not go live in Iowa or someplace? If they're too stupid to leave the damn city, maybe they deserve the swords in the eyeballs.",Null,3,4,7 April 2005
Evil Dead II," Best movie in the history of the universe.
","I wasn't able to get into the Evil Dead trilogy at first because I watched them all out of order. I was put off by the over the top juvenile humor in Army of Darkness, but I now realize it was just an extension of what Sam Raimi was perfecting here. This is an awesome black comedy featuring some of the sickest slapstick I've ever seen in a movie, and loads of dry humor (example: horrible demonic noises start coming from behind a bedroom door. Girl points to door and says, 'It's in there').The first half is basically a one-man comedy show starring the amazingly talented Bruce Campbell, who makes an idiot redneck into one of the most memorable movie heroes ever. In fact, when other people finally reach the cabin, it slows the whole thing down. That's my only complaint: the movie is too long. It would have worked better as a short. For example, they could have done without the tiresome sequence of the girl running into the woods and the others coming after her (and no shock factor like in the first movie's version). I'm not watching this to see a damn search party, for heaven's sake, I'm watching it to see Bruce Campbell fighting off possessed body parts with a chainsaw and saying things like, 'You're going down!' If your idea of a good movie is black humor combined with old-fashioned slapstick, this is the movie for you. It's a shame Sam Raimi abandoned stuff like this to make trendy crap. I'd rather watch insanity like 'Evil Dead 2' than the Spiderman movies any day. 8/10.",8,1,2,9 November 2005
