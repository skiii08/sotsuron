The Rock," All noise, no brains : typical 90's movie
","This might in the future look like a typical 90's movie,throwing everything out of the window that doesn't make it ashow. Alcatraz turns into some warehouse so full of noise thatyou feel like Godzilla is locked out in the bathroom (and mightgive Indiana Jones his truck-riding due), Cage is moreover-the-top than ever, the editing 'MTV-style' (some says, butthey should know better) is so fast that you can't get a fullgrasp of the action, the cinematography is unrealistic, theConnery character knows everything but the latest winningLottery ticket And the music is there where you must laugh, orbe moved, as if it was written on panels. Amongst the meanies,you have the distinction betwenn the 'good' army type, withmorals - in cas somebody thought it might be anti-militarist -and 'bad' bounty hunters. This is not stupid as in 'BrokenArrow', but since John Woo showed the whole world that you cando action with a brain, this overblown quality doesn't reallygel, even if the whole deal is highly watchable. One might thingBay is refining his art : 'Bad Boys' was unsufferable as ittried to fit in all the spark of a TV show, this one has morebudget than brains and 'Armaggedon' was definitely as stupid andunbelievable, but much more fun and entertainment. Do we reallybelieve Bay when he says he'd like to try some  'intimist'cinema, without explosions ? Somehow, your Phaithful Phroggydoubts it. Anyway, what will people think of all this in tenyears, when cinema will have evolved ? Good question. And whatwill Ba",Null,2,3,5 September 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Back to the roots
","Since there was no 'hype'in France and I don't listen to critics anyway, I saw this movie with no preconceptions other than the trailer. By the way, it must be the cheaper-made movie in recent history ! Instead of being innovative, it gave me the feeling of going back to the roots of horror with stories, not by Lovecraft, but Algernon Blackwood ('The Wendigo') or Arthur Machen, who could convey this sense of unseen terror and dangerous landscapes. The idea seemed reminescent of the 'dogma' movies and a series of mock-documentaries made by the French/German TV channel Arte, all showing false documentaries about abnormal events presented as the real thing - but giving the trick in the end to question the viewer's gullibility. (But the filmmakers of BWP can't have seen it, of course.) And the movie ? I thought the end was a bit of a let-down, but as a suspense story, it was quite gripping. Why all the hype ? Maybe because low-budget ground-breaking horror is an established tradition since NOTLD and there was nothing else around ?(Like 'Henry', very overrated in my opinion.) Why did  the media jumped on it ? Maybe the devil made them do it, or i",7,1,1,28 July 1999
Notting Hill," Britain versus the US ?
","As Mr Stuart Brown summed it up - though I don't know him -maybe you have to be a British expatriate to love this one. I'mnot, but Notting Hill is one of my favourite place in London. Infact, the best parts of this movie includes Hugh 'Hmmmmmm-hawwwwww- Grant's family + roommate and seems to belong to another movie - an english one. The rest is aHollywoodian love story, where characters fall in love forunfathomable reason and keeps on acting unfathomably stupidbefore the 'Happily-ever-after' ending. No doubt, the secondarycharcaters are great, but no one can believe in Robertts/Grantcharacters and actions. The most beautiful scene in the movie,the one to decipher again and again, shows a passing of seasonsthrough Notting Hill in one (apparent) sequence. Which shows thedirector deserves better than this material. Actually I liked'Message in a bottle' better : as a romantic comedy, it wascontrived too, but featured atmosphere and believable characters: both things 'Notti",2,0,4,8 December 1999
Green Street Hooligans," Well done, but ambiguous
","Okay, I liked this movie. Very much. Maybe as a fan of everything (well, most) things British. It even went ways I would not have foreseen : there IS one death in the end, but not the one I had foreseen, and not in the way I had predicted. Also, though highly indifferent to anything soccer so I can't tell if it's true, I liked how they showed that those hooligans are in fact functional, hold jobs, but are addicted to violence and the men bonding that results. BUT (Possible spoilers) The ending left me wondering, as it seems to be gloryfying petty, ugly violence as a way of life. Do you really learn anything from hanging with a crowd of drunken louts fighting for the most stupid reason, if they need one ? Then going into 'Rumble Fish' territory with an ex-member who comes back for more ? I understand the director  who did an excellent job  is a woman and an ex-fighter. As an ex-martial arts practicionner myself who hates violence (those who tried martial arts will understand that it's not contradictory), I'd think she'd know better. And the revenge angle in the last minutes felt more like a Hollywood convention. Yes, he did not beat the crap out of the other guy, but went out with aforementioned drunken louts' hymn, for Pete's sake ! Don't know. It's a good movie, with powerful performances and a few contrievance, but I guess I liked 'The football factory' better. It showed how those louts don't even need football as an excuse, crass violence is all those hooligans losers need",Null,0,0,15 August 2008
Cube," Sartre meets 'Prison' !?
","Right now, 'Cube' is being released in France with an unbelievable success for a movie with no 'name actors' and no hype, expect the numerous prices it got at the (formerly deconsidered by critics and audiences alike) Gerardmer film festival. It probably proves that the audiences are expecting something else than stupid Hollywood blockbusters fare. This one is very much a play on Sarte's 'Huis clos' ('L'enfer, c'est les autres' - 'Hell is the other people') infused with thriller and sometimes basic horror overtones. The scenario seems to have been written by a philosopher and a mathematician, and the ending seems to enter religious parable territory ('Happy are the feeble-minded'). I thought the pretty thin premise would wear thin after an exciting first half-hour, but the movie never lets go, helped by a very strong cast. Sometimes, there are artificial or too obvious ways to highten the tension (Like killing first the prisoner who seems the most likely to survive and a sudden incursion in Friday the 13th territory, etc) but this is understandable for a first effort and gives some naive, passionate flavor to the proceedings, compared to computer-generated Hollywoodian scenarios. Besides, this proves you don't have to make a billion-sized blockbuster choke-full of special effects to build up a good movie.",10,7,11,8 May 1999
