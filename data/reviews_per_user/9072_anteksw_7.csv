Black Swan," Overdone Melodrama
","This is a film I've been meaning to watch for years, so naturally I built up some pretty high expectations over time. I went into 'Black Swan' expecting nothing but greatness I mean, how could I not? Almost everything about it sounds great: an intriguing female protagonist, a plot centred around the themes of pressure and sanity, set within an intimidating theatrical environment, and on top of that, starring Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel. There is so much potential in all of this for a masterful art house tour de force, but unfortunately only a small portion of that potential is actually utilised.'Black Swan', although rich in clever symbolism and captivating performances, feels like a complete and utter mess in terms of tone and style. In regards to genre, this film is classified as a 'thriller/drama'... but it feels like a 'melodrama' more than anything, and surprisingly, not due to the performances, but due to its obnoxiously bizarre editing choices. There are countless scenes throughout the film which would have worked so much better if they weren't presented in such an over-the-top manner; scenes that feature raw emotion and truly praise-worthy work from the incredibly talented Natalie Portman - which unfortunately can't be fully appreciated due to the distracting soundtrack being constantly used out of place, as well as abrupt cuts which only seem to be there in an attempt to make the given scene feel more 'energetic'. It really is frustrating, as all the 'energy' that is required is fully provided by the actors themselves; the technical additions just feel forced and eventually become irritating. Almost all of the editing and tonal choices are constructed so poorly and even worse, they just felt so damn unnecessary.The tone even shifts into the territory of 'horror', and I don't mean cleverly constructed tension or even some of that Lynchian mastery, what I mean is terrible jump 'scares' that fail to fulfil their basic purpose - I'm talking about the type of jump scares you'd expect in the lowest tier of juvenile 'horror' films. Jump scares, despite sounding cheap, can be done well - David Lynch certainly proved this in his films but that's definitely not what we receive here, what we receive here is some obnoxious editing that feels like it was slapped together by an edgy teenager because of how corny it feels. This is just one of the few aspects that felt awkwardly out of place, it's as if one of the purposes of this film is to try and distract you from the truly wonderful performances provided by the entire cast, which is truly unfortunate, especially concerning Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel - these two in particular were perfectly cast and kept me glued to the screen throughout the entire run-time of the film, despite its annoying distractions. The acting and the script are the only aspects that made me give this film an 'above average' rating, they are also the only aspects which made this film worth watching, just about everything else brings it down and ultimately makes it a frustrating viewing experience.In conclusion, 'Black Swan' just feels like wasted potential - it feels like a masterpiece trapped within a mediocre execution. Despite my harsh words, it is a film I would recommend watching at least once for the performances alone; Natalie Portman gives one of the best performances of her career and truly captivates from start to finish. There's even some clever symbolism based on the themes implemented throughout, but just like with the acting, it's difficult to appreciate with all the distracting nonsense thrown on top of it. I'm giving 'Black Swan' a mild 6,4/10 - there is definitely a great film within, so it really is quite a shame that it had to be executed this way.",6,13,18,6 November 2016
Spotlight," A Riveting & Important Piece of Cinema
","With 'The Hateful Eight' being my favourite film of 2015, it's pretty obvious that I enjoy dialogue-driven movies which showcase true talent... and thankfully, 'Spotlight' is one of those movies. This film arrived at a perfect time - with the internet slowly killing off print media and people forgetting about the significance of investigative journalism, Tom McCarthy reminds us that real news can have a massive impact in the corrupted world we live in. Watching 'Spotlight' at the cinema restored my faith in the current state of the film industry - alongside all the reboots and mindless action flicks, important works of art are still being created and distributed across the world, and I am truly glad I had the chance to support this film.'Spotlight' tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, but it also explores the painful trauma of those unfortunate victims and the sheer determination of some amazing journalists to get those voices heard and make things right. It's one of those riveting stories that keep you on the edge of your seat simply through a great script and stellar performances; Mark Ruffalo amazed me in particular with his energetic and captivating performance, and even two lesser-known actors (Michael Cyril Creighton and Jimmy LeBlanc) portraying two of the victims managed to impress me quite a lot in their short yet emotionally powerful roles. In short, the casting for this film was perfect - each actor gave their best and worked off the expertly written script wonderfully.On the technical side of things, the film doesn't exactly 'impress', the camera work isn't anything special - simple shots with simple compositions creating and showing what's necessary, and that's okay. The film doesn't need to be visually impressive, it needs to be coherent and represent the story in an appropriate manner... which is what it achieves. If I had to pick out a negative aspect, it would have to be the soundtrack - it's somewhat typical, simplistic and it enters the film way too often, generally making some of the transitions feel either awkward or forced. But that's it, that's the only flaw I could think of in this otherwise magnificent piece of cinema. 'Spotlight' is not just an impressive achievement, it's an important film that needs to be seen by everyone, which is why I'm giving it a solid 9,2/10.",9,4,8,2 February 2016
The Revenant," A Visual Marvel
","It has been over a month since I saw this film at the cinema... and I'm certainly glad I had the chance to experience it on the big screen. The visuals are so strikingly captivating that they stayed with me to this day - I wouldn't have a problem with saying that this is some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in film, especially if you take the natural lighting into consideration. If you're anything like me and you appreciate innovative camera work, you'll be amazed with the shots they managed to capture in 'The Revenant'. But besides being a visual marvel, does the film succeed in being a compelling tale like Iñárritu's previous works?Well, yes, it does... to an extent. We follow Hugh Glass on a harrowing journey as he fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead, and what we get is essentially a simple revenge story. This is one of those films that absolutely excels in some parts, yet barely delivers in others. After the amazing opening sequence and the terrifying bear attack which was just simply masterful, the film felt like it slowed down... and although I wasn't taken out of the story at any point, I definitely felt that there were some pacing issues. It's not by any means a 'boring' film - as it crafts tension extremely well and feels consistent with it throughout, but with the addition of slightly pretentious dream sequences and a reliance on style over substance (or in this case, beautiful imagery over narrative) the film unfortunately starts to drag a little.In regards to DiCaprio's performance, it was great as usual, but was it Oscar-worthy? This was a role that clearly relied on physicality rather than emotion - which is what I felt the character was lacking where it seemed necessary. If this performance wins Leo an Oscar it'll feel like it happened purely because the Academy believes it owes him one. Besides, Oscars don't define good acting, as many great actors have never won an Oscar... but I digress. Tom Hardy pulled off a decent job as usual, Domhnall Gleeson was absolutely fantastic despite his limited amount of screen time, and I was pleasantly surprised by Will Poulter's also small but memorable performance. All in all, I can't really complain about the performances, and despite a lack of emotion on DiCaprio's part, his energy and drive still kept me at the edge of my seat.If I were to rate this film based purely on its visuals and cinematography, I would give it a perfect 10 out of 10. However, due to its flawed pacing and other minor negatives (such as out of sync dialogue) I cannot give 'The Revenant' a perfect score. Iñárritu decided to showcase physical brutality instead of emotional brutality he incorporated in his previous films such as 'Biutiful' or 'Birdman' - which I found to be more effective and far more emotionally powerful. That being said, 'The Revenant' is still an incredible achievement in filmmaking and provides one hell of a compelling journey. It is a simultaneously mesmerising and suspenseful piece of cinema that not only showcases breathtaking cinematography alongside a beautiful soundtrack, but also displays the dedication of one of the best directors working today.",9,3,5,22 February 2016
Foxcatcher," An Exceptionally Haunting Character Study
","Over three weeks have passed since I viewed this film at the cinema, and to this day it has been continuously on my mind.'Foxcatcher' was one of my most anticipated films of 2014; primarily being hooked by the plot synopsis as well as the cast and director involved. The trailers further heightened both my excitement and expectations, surprisingly I wasn't feeling sceptical about actors mostly involved in comedy portraying characters in a serious film like this. In fact, I was pleased to see Carell taking on such a challenging role, and hopefully expanding his versatility as an actor in terms of portraying another antagonist of sorts since 'The Way Way Back'.Thankfully, this film utterly exceeded my expectations, despite being dissimilar to what the trailer indicated. I was expecting a decent drama with swift pacing and strong performances, instead, I was swept up in a realistic character study which felt strangely atmospheric due to its overriding gritty tone. One of the reasons why the film stuck in my mind as much as it did, was due to the way it 'felt' and left me feeling afterwards; it was as if I simply 'observed' three people's lives. This was achieved by the slow pacing, long takes showcasing REAL emotion and the minimal use of a soundtrack allowing me to effectively experience and take in the chemistry between the characters.The performances did not disappoint either, they were phenomenal and according to me achieved exactly what was required in order for the plot to feel enticing. Firstly, I believe Steve Carell knocked it out of the park; his performance genuinely felt creepy and haunting, merely his presence and figure expression in a given scene evoked a sense of ceaseless dread. Both Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum equally delivered, their performances felt truly genuine; displaying intensity both mentally and physically in a flawless manner. I personally believe all three performances were equally worthy of an Oscar, both Ruffalo and Carell certainly deserved their nominations.To conclude, the wait for this film was definitely worthwhile. Although some people may find the slow pacing and gritty tone distasteful, I found that it helped the film and character development maintain engaging throughout. In addition to this, the film looked excellent, the cinematography was alluring and effectively further helped to set the tone. I'm giving this film a strong 9,7 as it provides an exceptionally haunting and enticing character study, and thus essentially achieves everything it strives for as a compelling biopic.",10,5,10,3 February 2015
Room," A Heart-Warming Story
","I didn't really have any big expectations when going into 'Room' - I initially thought it looked like one of those Oscar bait titles that tries way too hard to be emotionally powerful and becomes an overdone melodrama. However, after seeing a few scenes and realising that it's directed by Lenny Abrahamson (previously having directed the quirky masterpiece known as 'Frank') it intrigued me, and started to look like a lot more than just typical Oscar bait... and thankfully, it was. This is one of those beautiful films that manages to capture the strength of love and the importance of family, as well as reminding us that the less we have, the more we appreciate.'Room' tells the story of a devoted mother's relationship with her five-year-old son, Jack, who has been living in an enclosed 'room' ever since he was born. This is essentially the boy's whole world for the first five years of his life, which immediately establishes the mother as a strong and loving character with the determination to bring up her son properly, providing him with happiness and creativity despite their harsh living conditions. Abrahamson often incorporates tight framing and close-up shots here in order to signify how restricted these characters are in a physical sense, yet how open they are emotionally - making for some genuinely heartfelt interactions. This is where the film succeeds, seeing a realistic relationship between a loving mother and her young son is truly heart-warming, especially if you take their limited surroundings into consideration. Even when the tone switches and tension is built up, realism is still maintained, the characters feel just as engaging, and the overall atmosphere is handled pretty well throughout.Unfortunately, despite how well these interactions work, the focus always leans towards the character of Jack and his perspective of the world, with segments featuring narration from the little boy himself as he adjusts and learns about the real world for the first time. This basically provides us with the typical portrayal of children in films like this - innocent, naive and somewhat cute... and although there isn't anything wrong with the execution of this, it's nowhere near as captivating as the actual relationship between the mother and the son. After a while, the film starts to slightly lose focus in general, by including some drama which felt somewhat forced and unnecessary. However, these are just minor flaws in the grand scheme of things.In terms of cinematography, the film seems to switch between Dogme 95 style filming (handheld/steadicam) and standard static shots, which feels quite inconsistent in terms of style, but works pretty well regarding the atmosphere being conveyed. When it comes to acting, everyone pulled off a magnificent job; Brie Larson winning an Oscar for this role was well-deserved, and although I'm not really a fan of child actors (they can either be great or just really cringe-worthy), I thought Jacob Tremblay was pretty fantastic in his role. All in all, this is a heart-warming story with some phenomenal performances and beautiful sequences that will undoubtedly tug at your heartstrings, which is why I'm giving this film a very strong 8,4/10.",8,1,4,6 March 2016
Frank," Simply Wonderful
","I wasn't quite sure what to expect when going into 'Frank', I remember initially anticipating this film... and suddenly, somewhere along the line, I became sceptical as it started appearing like a pretentious comedy centred around hipsters. However, 'Frank' thankfully turned out to exceed my expectations far more than I would have ever anticipated. I honestly feel a sense of guilt for ever doubting this film, it just proves how a book should never be judged by its cover, or in this case, how a film should not be prejudged due to poor marketing.First and foremost, the writing in this film is undeniably good; predictability is never an issue as the narrative takes turns left and right constantly. Each character is developed to an appropriate extent; there is never a sense of dwelling on the exploration of these individuals or their respective issues. Instead, everything is simply presented as it is without much context, and personally had me questioning certain characters' motives or actions throughout the film. However, the perfect ending ties everything together, it feels strangely rewarding and certainly proves how well this film is written and directed, as well as of course, acted.Michael Fassbender, in my opinion, gives an Oscar-worthy performance. I realise this may be a bold statement, but Fassbender delivers everything there is to deliver for an elaborate character such as Frank. Contrary to people's judgement regarding Fassbender's performance relying on physicality due to sporting the giant fake head for almost the entire film; I believe his performance brings far more to the film including terrific voice acting, whilst showcasing familiar traits associated with people such as Frank in an appropriate manner. Domhnall Gleeson and Maggie Gyllenhaal both deliver very good performances, and despite not seeing any other work featuring Gleeson prior to watching this film; I was absolutely enticed in his journey as the supposed protagonist known as Jon. His character is likewise developed to an appropriate extent, being both relatable and simultaneously distasteful at times, and thus all the more realistic and therefore captivating.The only criticism I can think of is the fact that this film is predominantly marketed as a simple quirky comedy, and just like with films such as 'Sideways' (which is one of my favourite films of all time), it is primarily a drama featuring comedic attributes every so often. 'Frank' does however maintain an overriding sense of quirkiness which thankfully doesn't distract from the plot or the characters, and at times helps the film to maintain on a more light-hearted level; the quirky tone it provides simply makes the film even more entertaining and enjoyable. To conclude, 'Frank' is definitely one-of-a-kind, it is a simply wonderful experience and legitimately makes me upset that it is such an underrated film; it definitely deserves more recognition!",10,0,3,11 February 2015
Moon," Truly Astonishing in ALL Aspects
","I was intrigued to watch this film for a while, predominantly due to the fact that one of my favourite (and undoubtedly underrated) actors, Sam Rockwell, stars in it. Furthermore, the film is directed by Duncan Jones; who has previously impressed me with 'Source Code' and has since left me wanting to explore more of his work. Essentially, I went into this film with high expectations, and oh boy, were they exceeded.'Moon' takes place on the moon, surprisingly, and explores the isolated character of Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell) nearing the end of his three-year stint on the moon, whilst working alongside his friendly computer GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). I'm not going to give away any more details of the plot, as with all films, it's best to go in blind or with as little information as possible in order to simply 'experience' the story unfold. This film most definitely deserves that approach, it captures isolation and human emotion on a genuinely profound level, and Rockwell's riveting performance is undoubtedly an Oscar-worthy one. Even Spacey's voice acting as GERTY is strangely satisfying to me; evoking this calming yet intriguing tone throughout the film which additionally helped to stabilise the drama, combined with Sam Rockwell's truly magnificent acting preventing this film from falling into a feeble melodrama.Everything works perfectly here: the cleverly written script, the visually pleasing set design and even the slightly slow pacing which I didn't see as a flaw whatsoever. The pacing was perfect in this film; it made it feel all the more real and thus enticing, along with a captivating soundtrack to create an utterly fascinating atmosphere throughout. This film is without a doubt, truly astonishing in all aspects, and certainly exceeded my already high expectations. Duncan Jones' direction and Sam Rockwell's amazing performance (he absolutely deserves all of the praise) combined with a compelling plot result in a masterpiece of a film that doesn't shy away from exploring human emotion and struggles on a deeper level, whilst delving into two of the trickiest genres to pull off. I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good cinema, not just the fans of Sci-Fi.",10,1,4,20 December 2014
