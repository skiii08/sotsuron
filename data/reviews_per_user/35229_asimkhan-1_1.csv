Hereditary," 7.3 rating is tragic and Horror
","How is this movie rated 7.3? This deserves to be in top 250.This was the most horrific movie I have ever watched and trust me, I have seen all, including the super scary Japanese ones as well. I kept on delaying watching this movie due to the low rating.This is not just horror but pure art. The scenes where the coffin is lowered into the grave and the camera moves like you are going into the grave, when the sister dies and peter just could not look at the back seat was true horror as well as real. I felt I am peter and I did something terribly wrong, I would have done exactly the same thing as he did, did not look at the backseat, I am glad he didn't but like peter i kept on thinking maybe the sister is alive, by any chance, maybe if I don't look and reach home , maybe there is an off chance that she is alive. I knew she is dead but like peter I could not come to terms with it, I did not wanted to face the truth. Ari Aster you are a genius and giving this movie 7.3 on IMDB is an horrific as the movie.",10,4,8,15 September 2019
