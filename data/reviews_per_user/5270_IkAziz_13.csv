","A story set in 60s Richard kuklinski a protective family man,at same time he is a ruthless and psychopathic contract killer..Actual this movie is about a biopic of hitman who kills more than 250 peoples in his lifetime.literally Michael Shannon carries the whole movie on his shoulder...Film is very well paced from the beginning,the character development of Richard kulinski is well established in many interesting ways...Few scenes are little Disturbing for viewers but The icemen a wroth watching film....",7,0,10,7 August 2019
Blade Runner 2049," A Fine Sequel From Dennis...
","A Set in future,agent k a blade runner in mission to track down a former replicant hunter Film begins with agent k hunting down a replicant a very short fight scene,then boredom starts with a romance stuffs between agent k n holographic girlfriend..Again film moves forward in interesting path investigating a skeleton of dead replicant,were actual plot of this movie itself start after first 35mins,again agent k is tasked to find his former to slove the mystery...2nd half of the movie was bit interesting to watch that to coz Harrison ford,ryan gosling performance is plain soulless,even hard to say..Ridley Scott's original blade runner was a cult classic hit,coz for film's interesting concept,Harrison ford performance is top notch,visuals are absolutely brilliant,slow paced but it keeps spectators towards the edge of the seat till the end..2049 really lacks that vision and soul,Dennis tried his best to create modern version of it and respect to him...",7,0,7,7 August 2019

Deepwater Horizon," Best disaster Drama of this Decade...
","Deepwater horizon (2016)
Probably one of the best disaster drama in last 10 year which itself based on true event n please refer Google once before u watch this movie..mike Williams ( mark wahlberg) is just a normal family guy works in huge oil rig site (based on real life character)
Most of the film take place offshore gaint drilling rig,First half is bit slow even opening scenes are not much to do with a actual movie they just shown for character introduction...Actual movie starts after 45mins most of first half scenes are about technical side stuffs of how oil rig process works n its something like documentary but worth watching...second half almost racy n edge of the seat experience till the climax scene,fire explosion scenes are really a visual treat
CGI is one of the most perfect part of this movie n also amazing Background score too...A good entertaining movie with the message...",7,0,0,6 August 2019
Dark City," A Scifi Masterpiece...
","Plot:john a mid age man with a no memories about his past and also trapped in a strange nightmarish city
First half Movie Opens as ordinary suspense story,like hero discovering about his past and identity but
after 30 mins it's completely full of terrific twists and turns, villains are absolutely a best part of this movie,plz don't expect High octane stunts or CGI in this flick coz its SciFi...But Entire film is Visually stylish and looks good as realistically
I don't want to spoil more about this movie here,Dark city is a One more hidden gem in Hollywood..A highly recommended and must watch movie for those who addicted to a complicated and mind bending type of films...",7,2,2,6 August 2019
It Follows," Overrated horror film Of the decade...
","A young girl is chased by mysterious supernatural entities no spoilers Movie starts out with a cliffhanger scene then some wired intimate scenes, later 30mins with twist the actual story start,few scenes in 2nd half are really scary and tense,especially background score.I come through lots of ending/opening scene theories about this movie n i have read few ones too then only i came to know that I almost stupidly wasted my time by seeing those theories..actually director of this movie fools the viewers to believe this film as extraordinary cult horror thriller..i openly says this is one of the most overrated horror movie i ever seen, even oculus deserve much Better rating than this movie The main reason why I hate this movie is really there is no explanation or Even a hint about a supernatural demon 'it' chasing peoples for a stupid reason...A worth watching for one time..",7,0,1,6 August 2019
Drive," Refn's Finest Film ever....
","Since i finished watching all Nicholas Winding refn movies so far he directed,I felt Refn is most underrated Filmmaker of this era...Drive is first movie I watched Winding Refn movie i watched and first ryan Gosling movie too,I say Refn is master in creating unique Characters and drive is just example for that...In movie Ryan's character is so pretty hard to predict,he is so calm and cool as mechanic,stunt artist by daytime,on other hand he was so mysterious and rough to handle...Visually are simply gorgeous and stunning,some Gore & Violence moments were pretty decent/Realistic not much over the top...Drive is a Great suspense thriller with Fine level of Romance and action...",7,1,1,7 August 2019
The Lion King," A joyful Nostalgia Ride...
","Watched one of the anticipated film of the year.since a week I'm bit worried about critical reception this movie is getting.but I say filmmaker jon favreau yet to direct bad movieLast Disney remake 'Aladdin ' is a mixed bag for me it has some Worthy moments as well some flaws too,But here the lion king really Captured both Style and substance very well.Most importantly voice cast deserves some praise and hanz zimmer as well.mostly nostalgia fans trashing that film has no soul,fail to re imagine original version..Just forget animated film for a moment and watch this one with fresh mind.it will surely worth your time and money...",7,0,1,24 July 2019

which based on real events First half is as usual just setting up the film tone..main characters and their mission In Second Half there are so many thrilling n intense scenes it keeps viewer to hooked till end Josh brolin performance is one the highlight of this film..inbetween so many melodramatic moments makes bit boring..
