Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Love it
","I have been a Star Wars fan for my entire life. I think they are the greatest movies ever. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I expected The Phantom Menace to have great story, action, directing, and special FX like the original. And guess what....it did. The first of the Star Wars prequels lives up to the hype and fits in very well with the original trilogy. Unlike some people who are not TRUE Star Wars fans, I loved this movie and cannot wait for the next two. Keep up the great work Mr. Lucas. :-)",Null,0,0,11 May 2001
Scary Movie 2," Fabulous
","Scary Movie 2 is really funny. If you liked the first than you will like this one as well. For those who who think movies should be artsy fartsy and contain some kind of message about the human experience....don't watch. But if you have a sense of humor than you should definately watch this. The Ana Farris is a hotty. Yes, I said hotty. The jokes are as funny and dirty as ever. The Wayans are the real kings of comedy.",Null,0,1,4 July 2001
Titanic," Enough already
","Stop talking about how great this movie is. It had a nice story, good acting, and good special effects. This is the most overrated movie in the history of film. People have forgotten the classics like Godfather, Gone With the Wind, and Star Wars. The story isn't that great because I knew exactly how it would end. The acting was the same as most movies and the special effects were pretty simple compared to most big budget movies that have been released in the past ten years. ** out of ****. Long live Star Wars!!!!",Null,2,3,3 July 2001
