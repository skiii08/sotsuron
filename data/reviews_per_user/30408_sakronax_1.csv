The King's Speech," A story about a prince with a stammering issue that has to conquer it so that he can become a king.
","The King's Speech'I am in awe after seeing this beautiful film, it had risen drastically above all of my expectations, which to say the least were very low. As a person who is not in favour of historical biography-like films, I consider this genre rather boring – this film had proved me wrong. Written by David Seidler and directed by Tom Hooper, The King's Speech' is a surprisingly interesting and humorous story of the King George (played by of the United Kingdom. The story takes place in England, in the Buckingham palace where Prince Albert, played by Colin Firth, who is soon to be King George VI, his wife and their two daughters are resided. Albert's father, King George V has high hopes for his elder son, David to take on the throne after he has died. Albert, or Bertie how his family calls him, is very content with that decision as he has a severe stammering problem, which can be clearly seen when his father asks him to speak in front of a larger audience. Bertie's wife, Queen Elizabeth is looking for a speech therapist that could help Bertie conquer his stammering issue, unfortunately, most of the therapist's Bertie has attended treated him as if he was mentally challenged. Finally, Bertie finds Lionel, a speech therapist who sees the person that Bertie really is, an intelligent young man and decides to help him regain his confidence during which he treats him as an equal. David gives up his throne to marry a divorced woman and Bertie is forced to become the king – his speech therapy then becomes extremely important as he has no choice other than to prepare himself to become a king.I enjoyed this movie immensely for two particular reasons, one: it was very relatable as I myself, used to suffer from a stammering problem and two – it had change my point of view about historical dramas. Until today, I have thought of this genre as the most boring of them all, because let's face it, some of these movies are actually pretty boring unless you are particularly interested in the subject that the film is about. However, while I was not interested in this topic before I watched the movie, it turned out to be much more interesting and enjoyable than I would have thought – along with historical facts the director managed to make this movie humorous. For example, in the scene when Lionel asks Bertie to let out his confidence by saying rude words, it was really silly and funny to think about a royal figure shouting inappropriate words in a therapist's office, but it made sense. Psychologically, it is proved that shouting and saying rude words helps to let out stress and that was what Albert had to do. Linked to what I have said before, I think that this story's moral is to make us aware that even King's and Queen's may have had anxiety problems and if only a person sets his or her mind on improving their speech or curing' their anxiety, it will subside and they will slowly gain confidence good enough for a king. I would recommend this movie to lovers of historical based films, comedies and dramas. I understand why the rating of the movie is higher than PG, but other than the scene with curse words, there is nothing in this movie that could be considered as inappropriate for a younger audience.",10,0,0,1 February 2016
