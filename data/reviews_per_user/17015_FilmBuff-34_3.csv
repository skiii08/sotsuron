The Blair Witch Project," Really creepy
","Blair Witch is a film that should be viewed by every person, or at least every person who doesn't have a weak stomach. The Blair Witch Project will most likely knaw at the back of your mind all day. If you see it in the morning, it will completely terrify you for the rest of the day. If you see it at night, you'll be afraid to leave the theater. A whole lot of people no longer go camping thanks to this film. Blair Witch will really give you the creeps, not just the 'loud noise out of nowhere' rule, it will get you thinking. It will stay with you for a long time, you will never look at the woods the same way. I highly recommend this film for any people who believe in any supernatural articles, and for any guy who takes a date to this, she will be clinging to you for dear life.",10,1,3,2 August 1999
Spice World," I love this movie
","I'm not a huge Spice Girl fan but i really liked this. I am a male, so this might look odd that I was watching Spice World, well at first when it came to video I wouldn't let it in the house, Then it came on HBO and I watched it and loved it. For men, watch it at least twice, once to stare, then to listen. Girls you can watch it for the music and the comedy, just watch it though.",10,1,2,20 July 1999
Goodfellas," Possibly the best movie ever
","'Goodfellas' is possibly the best movie ever created in the history of film. It gives an exact account of life in the mob, how it works, what to do with the rats. It truly is a hallmark of our times, with the workings of Bobby DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liota, this is a treasure. 'Goodfellas' has the best song for the credits, and when Tommy gets made they play the piano exit to Layla by Clapton, the greatest song of all time. All I can say is that this movie should be in everyone's library of videos.",10,0,1,5 May 1999
