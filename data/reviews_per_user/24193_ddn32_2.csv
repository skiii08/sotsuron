The Benchwarmers," Utter Crap
","I know Adam Sandler has become a very rich man by aiming low. However,this is worse than a punch to the balls, which I am sure Mr. Sandler and the amazing number of people who actually liked this movie would find rather amusing.The humour is so weak. It is a 'nerd's revenge' movie that is so far fetched that your brain must take a two hour vacation. First of all, what 40 year old would play competitively against a bunch of 12 year olds? Secondly, there is no way that the dweeby character David Spade plays is going to interest that hot 25 year old Pizza Hut chick unless she has a loser fetish. Thirdly, they have to get moralistic in an attempt to make this more than a fart and nerd joke movie. Also, with so many ex-Saturday Night Live performers, you don't even have to watch it to know it will suck.Avoid at all costs, unless movies aimed at immature 12 year olds appeal to you.",1,3,5,1 December 2007
Da 5 Bloods," Mediocre at best
","This movie tried too hard. The idea for the story is compelling, but the dialogue is so forced and unnatural. It smacks of a 70's episode of Barnaby Jones or Mannix.",4,3,4,27 June 2020
