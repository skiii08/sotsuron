The Rock," Best Action Movie of the Year
","This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Very original idea, great actors (Ed Harris rocks!), fun and convincing. Plus the best movie soundtrack I personally have ever heard.",Null,1,1,24 March 1999
Apollo 13," My all-time favorite!
","This movie just plain rocks! I really got into manned spaceflight and aviation because of it. Brilliantly enacted (Ed Harris definitely should have been awarded an Oscar!), gripping and exciting. Plus you learn a lot about the entire Apollo era. It does not hurt that it features 4 of my favorite actors (Harris, Sinise, Bacon, Paxton) either. Although I have seen it a zillion times, the final splashdown makes my eyes water every time. Definitely a must-see and a must-own!",10,1,2,24 March 1999
