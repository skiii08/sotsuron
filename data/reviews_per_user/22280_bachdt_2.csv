The New World," An Art film, not for the general movie audience
","I don't get out to movies very often, maybe 3-4 times a year. So I was really ticked off that I ended up having to sit through this dreg of Cinematography.Movies like this should ONLY BE SHOWN AT THE ART FLICK venues! That way normal viewers like me won't be subjected to this kind of thing. I don't dislike Art movies, I just don't want to be fooled into going to one. I thought this was going to be another 'Pirates of the Caribbean' Same time frame, eh? Its not though. Just a nature film with an occasional shot of humans now and then.After the first day of the movie (er, hour sorry) I started thinking, 'Why didn't we go to Kong?? Monkey vs Dinosaur!' Yeah thats my kind of movie. It has action and even a plot you can follow. But alas I was sucked into 'New World' and 3 hours of my life is gone that I can never get back. On the other hand, if I'm ever told that I only have a week to live, I'll rent this movie and watch it over and over. Will it cure me?? No, but at least it will seem as if years are going by and I'll be happy to die when it comes.I guess you can say I didn't particularly like this film.",1,2,9,29 January 2006
Valkyrie," What do they want? The folks who gave this 1 star?
","I'm a voracious reader of history and list WWII as among my favorite grounds for research. This movie is hopefully one of the most persuasive mediums to those who know nothing about the great event. A great number of Germans knew that Hitler was a disaster for the empire. These people (no make that patriots) took an enormous risk to rid Germany of Hitler and the story needs to be told. So why the bickering over some time-lines? The scenery, uniforms, technology were faithfully exact and the sheer audacity of the whole plot was rendered in a true and believable manner. What do the 1 stars want? A stifled PBS document with a suitably dull narrator? I give Cruise and his cast a loud cheer to bring this moment of valor of the Germans to the large screen. I hope more like this come out but with the 1 star naysayers I doubt if we will see a big budget movie come out any time soon. I hope they are proud of themselves.",9,1,2,4 July 2009
