Angels & Demons," Message delivered, so why worry about the effects?
","If the Joker form the Dark Knight see Angels and Demons, he may pat on his hips saying, 'why so serious?' Actually all the commentors were complaining about the cast, the stiffy portrait of several center characters and the incomplete story that is cut from the novel...But my point is, the movie got its message perfectly delivered, so why so serious?First off, the movie is quite a sightseeing trip, reflecting last year's In Bruges. Vatican is absolutely a must-go on all the tourists' list! That is what I told myself after this entertaining viewing. Despite the fact that the movie was portraying Catholics in a negative way in a absolutely negative context, the movie was still allowed to be shot in Vatican. How ironic! Anyway, I quite enjoyed the effects they put in this one, much more than I did in the first one. Davinci Code was almost entirely handicapped compared to Angels and Demons, in terms of technical sophistication, cinematographic, plot development and most importantly, pacing. In fact, the pacing alone is worth seeing for those who like thrillers. Robert Langdon played by Tom Hanks and the religious fanatic Ewan Mcgregor were fun, or at least funny. However, under its sophisticated skin, Angels and Demons failed to be a better mystery thriller. The more obvious reason being the plot development. Wait, did I say it's better than 1st one, sure. But it's still weak. The ultimate bad guy in the movie could be figured out almost instantly in the branding iron scene with Mcgregor, not to mention his personal show thereafter. The movie is too dark to be Indianna Jones while too professional in religious history to be National Treasure, yet it didn't have much to offer a really unique style. That's why it ended the same pale way like its predecessor. The less obvious reason is different. To make a clarification, I am not a Catholic, but a believer in Jesus. So this movie for me, should be offering some really interesting(or meaningful) perspective to offset its apparent lack in goodwill. Unfortunately, I didn't find much. Simply stating, the movie sells its plot and message in a outright way that is considered outrageous by many, and that's weighted too much to bore all the audiences(presumably all non-Catholics). The problem is it's as superficial as it's based on the writer's historical knowledge(fantasy?), which is something you can't sell twice so easily. The climax reminded me of L.A. Confidential, however with all the flat roles and outright anti-Catholic propaganda, it got tired and tasteless.The worst thing about such a novel-adapted movie is that all the retarded assumptions look more retarded live, as if Catholics is the only religion the world knows, and the election of a new pope is hotter than US presidential trial, which gives Vatican a Hollowan. It's just too clich√©d to appreciate. 'Can you really give me something more detailed and solid so maybe I can scientifically prove this religious group's hyper-critic nature?That might be fun... ' The joker raised his right hand......The teacher didn't pick him. Sadly, the Joker had to make a list of messages the movie sells by himself. So: 1, Catholics(or all Christians) have a defending nature that protects all the dirty little secrets here and there, which is unforgivable for people who claim to be holy. 2, Since a pope unmanned all the scriptures some hundreds years ago for the sake of mind purity, this religion's teaching should be inhuman at all. 3, If you are a charity group as well as a bank, you are naturally a hypocrite. 4, The highest ranks of Catholics are a mess, since they can't overcome their superstitious/exaggerating nature that is dwelled in their faith and directly produced their hypocrisies and murders and all the worse-than-ordinary sins. Ah, please remember they did this one in special favor to the writer and director of 'Angels and Demons' the movie. See you next time.OK, if anyone tells you he hates/loves this movie by its messages, do notfight him. Just say you respect any given religion or philosophy, and the problem should be solved. Good luck!",6,0,1,1 August 2009
Vertigo," Another proof that Academy Award is a bad joke.
","Vertigo is a better Hitchcock movie if not the best. It's indeed not perfect. The bottom line is a very rigid ending, a (possible)miscasting for a major female character and nothing else. If the Oscar overlooked Hitchcock again solely for such reasons, I would say it's a bad joke.Technically stunning, this is the first words came to many critics. Visual effects should not be just defined as those special CG effects, but also the effects a movie's visual presentation on audiences. Vertigo is a case that such visual qualities affect you deeply. You must follow a woman, follow her wherever she goes, follow her beyond your logics and emotional boundary. Such a psychological process has been successfully presented using camera. Thanks to Stewart's emotional broken performance and Kim Novak's haunting existence, such a feeling is still as stunning and fascinating as 50 years ago.Contrast to my review, many critics listed Vertigo's ending as one of the best endings provided in Movie history. Tragedy and loss repeated itself and one must face his/her own deeds when it comes to judgment. That is my interpretation. However, it's also very obviously rigid. The entire movie has a strong undertone of tragedy, which renders Stewart's character into a sympathized object for many. If the protagonist would finally brought everything to justice and waited for Judy Button's release from jail, it would be perfectly logical, natural and positive. It seemed like they very intentionally made it a tragedy to the very last minute, which may be unnecessary. After all, it's a matter of taste.Except for that, Vertigo should have won best picture in Oscar, and many other awards. Sadly it didn't. But again, we see movies for good movies, not for Oscar.If Vertigo would teach us anything at all, that is 'do not trust beautiful women especially those who like you'. Magneto must be a Vertigo fan anyway. Ha ha!",9,3,7,3 August 2009
Changeling," This movie gave me stomachaches because it's so intriguing and gripping.
","In short, this well-directed, masterfully acted film will stay on the IMDb top 250 for a long time. It seemed the audiences tend to skip it due to the heavy tone and the heavy-handed 'true story'. However, it really deserved more than one viewing. The good: 1, Angelina Jolie. I can only say: she's totally true in every scene. Losing tens of pounds, she gave herself a nervous/desperate appearance right after the movie begins. It's not like she acted everyone off the screen, on the contrast, she's always weak, fearful and is everything a single mother would be. I like this character because she's an example of strength rising from love and hope, rather than hatred and anger. If you have stomach problem, I strongly suggest you take some anti-acid before viewing this, since Jolie's put in many tortures, mentally and physically. Anyway, I learned how strong a person can be in his/her mind.2, The story. It's not like Thelma and Louise, which preached feminism to an extreme. It's the journal of heartbroken person, a legend about enduring life's darkest periods. Such dark periods, regardless of the magnitude, can happen to anyone. In the movie, different types of crimes and misdeeds were exposed and explored, again gripping your stomach and challenging your heart. The mother, being weak and helpless, wanted to kept a good relation with the police/public/media, therefore reluctantly posed for a title photo which later turned out to be a nightmare. I mean, such kind of crap can happen everyday to any of us. Near the end, when the other captured boy was finally found after 6 years, he was questioned as why he didn't return and report the psychopath killer. His answer was also very shocking, stating that he was afraid that the public would blame his escape and cowardice. Such are victims. It's so realistic and mind-provoking that we're living in a miserable society, where a lot of things are waiting to be set straight.The bad: 1, It doesn't end a typical happy ending. 2, LAPD may still find this story horrifying and humiliating. 3, today we have a lot more social problems than 1928......I mean, the movie leaved me too many things to think about. I honestly recommend it to all of you. 9/10",9,2,3,22 June 2009
Frost_Nixon," Subtlety and character study are not for everyone.
","Well, if you try to compare Frost/Nixon with other semi-documentary movies like JFK, you will totally lose the point here. This is a movie where performances mattered,camera works matter and pace mattered. But none of them is enough to summarize the unique quality provided by this movie.It started slow with interviews with most of the leading actors in their characters. It gave you a realistic feeling from then. Then, it goes directly to the two title roles and their lives and interactions, and finally lead to maybe the most sublime conversation ever illustrated in a movie. A lot of audiences may have already known the contents and the results of such a conversation, but they, like me, were still totally stuck by the dramatic personality of Nixon and the presentation. Therefore, you can safely go to the theater and sit down to enjoy, even though you thought the story has nothing new to offer.The performances were nothing like you'd expect them to be. Frank Langella well deserved his Oscar nomination, while in my opinion, Michael Sheen also deserved to be nominated.But, sadly enough, all the people I recommended this movie to, tend to fall asleep watching it. Maybe subtlety and character study are really not for everyone.Excellent drama with excellent characters and messages. IQ required.",10,1,2,9 August 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Average.
","Compare to Ang lee's Hulk, this one is not aggressive nor ambitious at all. But it's an OK movie.Prior to viewing, I didn't read any of the comments therefore I have completely no stereotype about the movie at all. But I do have my expectations like others. Here they are: 1, Edward Norton, Liv Tailer, Tim Roth, William Hurt and even Robert Donney's performance. We got all these celebrities or should I say, award-winners. I wanted them to be explosive, which means more than average.2, Since Tony Stark also give a cameo appearance in the movie, I also expect it to be solidly written like Iron Man. So I was really thirsty for some Sci-fi twists.3, Ang Lee's Hulk is commented to be 'awful', so at least the audiences are give rights to compare them.So let's see the result. Quite interesting for me, I don't think this movie beats Ang Lee's 'awful' one. For some obvious reasons that, 1, Edward Norton is not a mile far better than Eric Banner. Instead, he turned out to be also average, nothing like the movies he was in before. There are very few memorable moments about him alone. What about the romance? Well, Liv Tyler is sexy in her own type, but neither a female scientist type nor a hot babe type. The real problem is that she has absolutely no electricity with Norton. The scenes they are together are always distanced, both characters avoiding each other like strangers. Plus the only funny scene the director arrange for them is not funny due to Tyler's performance, which is the New York taxi scene... Other actors are also average, not in their most comfortable type of characters. I was keep guessing which part will Tony Stark(Robert Donney Jr) play, but to my disappointment he just stayed on stage for 15 seconds.2, The movie is very stably paced, with each fight bigger than the former one. And all the characters made their senses in their actions during the storytelling. Tim Roth became obsessed with power alone and, General Hurt was proved to be wrong very clearly to the end. And Hulk just hide himself for a clearer reason than Ang Lee's version. But the problem comes. The movie leaves very few to be shot in a comical style, not even all the fight scenes. Ang Lee's version tried to produce an abusive visual style with an abusive Hulk, who's ultra-violent and the fans or non-fans can completely dip themselves in this style, enjoying. But Incredible Hulk tried to be average, producing nothing to blow the audiences away. In a less abusive manner, much of the story is straight-forward and easy to understand but also loses its dynamite.3, So now you have my conclusion: Incredible Hulk has a clearer storyline but not as violent as Hulk.7/10.",7,2,7,15 June 2008
Casablanca," really enjoyable, but could be better IMO
","As a 1980's generation movie fan, I haven't got my sense of 'classic' until I see this one. The whole story is very touching, and all the cast have given shining performances to the audience. When you see Rick's frown, you will be able to tell how much pain he suffered and concealed in the deep heart while you don't know whether he will return to the 'bright side' or not. All the other actors also done quite well. They may amuse you in a serious way or in a comic way--that is to be discovered by yourself. As time goes by, the song AS Time Goes By has occupied a part of American culture or even a part of the whole world's culture. I have heard it in a couple of advertisements or in the beginning of a TV programme. That was before watching the film. However, it is always like a warm stream running out of my heart each time I hear the song, after I saw it. Everybody has something within, which is extremely unique, precious and beautiful. No matter how many years have past, we can still remember it as something shining. That is the emotion held by Rick and other two main characters in the 'crazy world' of WW2, as individuals, as human.Most people defined it as 'perfact', while I think it could be better if the ending is not so dramatic and comfort and 'with everyone satisfied'. Rick has chosen to fight again for the bright side, maybe for the last time. So he deserved the very punishment that Nazis would give. So Rick could have turned away after the plane's taking off, leaving his fate to audience to guess.If the movie had gone in this way, I could have been even more satisfied because I am quite realistic. However, it is actually made during the war and people need more hope as Rick needed, as time needed. I am also not supposed to question the origin arrangement......My rating is 9/10",9,0,2,15 June 2006
Kung Fu Panda," Not only Good but also Makes me think.
","Kungfu Panda is marketed mainly as a children's movie with very childish style of cartoon-making and Jack Black. But it turned out to be eccentric and wonderful, a good story to bring your family to. If the box office becomes a flop(which is already impossible), it should be attributed to the marketing only.As the tag line says, 'Prepare for awesomeness.' Even after so many positive comments, I still have no idea what the movie will come out like. One reason I couldn't figure out what the movie will be about is the super-simple title. Will it be just another Forbidden Kingdom? Or another Mulan? Or will it even turns out to be another Bulletproof Monk, which is among the disgraces to the Chinese culture? Sorry about this but I've seen too many movies portraying Chinese culture too superficial, which assumes Chinese philosophy established on either Buddhism(usually fake Buddhism) or some ridiculous superstition. So first of all, I am glad to say Kung fu Panda is the first Hollywood-made Chinese movie ever to make me feel proud for my ancestors' culture. If I haven't guessed it wrong, the writers really took some time digesting Chinese philosophies like the relationship between 'Beings' and 'none-beings', and other basic Chinese ideas about life and faith. No matter how old you are, the movie will make think for some time. It discussed some deep topics about human desire, confidence and destiny. After seeing it, I sincerely think that human desire can be used for good, for our bodies are like super-advanced machines and if you manage it in the right way, it won't be harder than controlling machines. Ancient Chinese assimilated so many nutrition from nature that they have a vision to achieve a balance between everything, that is also a reminding to me as a Chinese, which makes me proud.The visual style of the movie completely beat my expectations. Everything is animated in a Chinese paper art style and the color red is so widely used as the main theme color. It touched me deeply because it reminded me of the glorious days of Chinese cartoons. It's like a combination of Matrix and traditional kung fu movies.For many obvious reasons, it has the potential to win the Oscar. I am looking forward to some better cartoons this year. But at the same time I want Kongfu Panda to be the best animated feature of the year.9/10 Almost excellent.",9,15,19,16 June 2008
Fight Club," Had to be ignored by Oscar, but was never forgotten by youngsters.
","When I saw a movie like Fight Club, it came to me that maybe the society and its critics, consensus and medias are too superficial. And, maybe it's the underground things that ruled.Don't call me crazy, cause that's the situation Fight Club met in the 10 years of its releasing. A lot of people blamed the Oscar for ignoring it, but I don't think that's necessary. Because, that's the way this movie worked. It's transmitting negative, anti-social and extreme ideologies to people, so by any means you shouldn't give it an Oscar. That's how the whole society and movie industry keep their agreement. But, don't worry. Fight Club found its own way to our minds. The movie is a trousers-striper who striped the trousers of the consumerism society and everyone who enjoyed themselves in it silently. So, if you feel offended by Fight Club, congratulations! It meant you are in the mainstream and doesn't need a change. If, more fortunately, you are encouraged and enlightened by Fight Club, congratulations again. It means you are exactly the targeted audiences of this crazy movie, and you 've just found your therapy group. It looked like there are hardly a middle-way, if you talk it in front of the public, that you have to either disapprove it or approve it. That's why I liked it.Nowadays people laugh at you if you try to reason with them by biblical teachings. So maybe sometimes they need something more 'explosive' and 'dynamic' to challenge their life-time values. Shake it baby! Shake your head or your heart! Anyway this movie delivered, and could be taught for good.Mr. Fincher, you should give more stuff like this. Don't worry about the critics and the terrorists. They will be entertained as well.",10,2,6,8 August 2009
Memento," Are you an ethical person?
","And that's one of the core messages the movie delivered to its audiences. With many twists and thoughts set up in a untraditional manner, Memento is essentially very poignant, depressing and can even be horrifying.The post-modern style of narrating is really fascinating, if not a bit over-the-top. However, any skepticism about this movie's style being over material is wiped out after the first viewing, if you really get it in the first viewing(which also proves you are cleverer than average). To say that the story in this movie flows backwards is a bit inaccurate because the story is an exploration of the origins of every chapter's confusion and conflicts. Have you ever tried to solve a puzzle because you experienced some terrible trauma? If yes, then Memento could be a very personal experience for you as you relate more and more to the main protagonist. Suppose we are given the tools of Leonard, should we be more competent in making the investigation? Or, are we asking ourselves what's justice and what it takes to be an ethical person? Thinking deep into these questions really made this movie a horror one.Each time a new character pops up in the screen, you would be puzzled by his/her reason to be present, in later segment of the movie you would know what a big crude lie he/she made for Leonard. You see? It's not up to us to decide we are ethical or not given this scenario. You could start like Teddy who wanted to help to end Leonard's misery by helping him and end like Teddy who's tired of Leonard's revenge game and begin to take advantage of that. You could also start like Natalie who's good at manipulating people's emotions, and then found a guy like Leonard a most valuable asset. The problem is anyone who encountered Leonard's condition will automatically become part of his dysfunction. The problem is, no one deserves to live with his condition, yet no one likes to share his burden and take care of his problem. That could be very morally challenging, especially if you had any family/friend who's not so normal.Proverbs 4:23, 'Above all else, guard your heart; for it is the wellspring of life.' Memento explores this script backwards, in which situations Leonard twisted himself again and again in pursuit of vengeance. Many people considered the movie a great plot hole because if Leonard really can't remember anything after the assault, how come he remembered he has the condition and the cops wouldn't help investigating the case? In the end, however, this is answered by Teddy that Leonard just remembered those he wanted to remember, which proves Leonard himself might just be a fraud, who's 'physically capable of making new memories' but would rather choose to lie to himself. You may pity with him because like an autistic person he is suffering. But, it's Leonard who caged himself in the middle of the misery, and wouldn't let himself go. The horrifying message is that there is already no truth for Leonard because everything he thinks that matters would be forgotten in next minute, yet the only truth left for the audience is that with submarine motivations everyone lies just like Leonard and Teddy. However, thanks to the Bible which tells us people CAN choose to lie or to tell the truth(even mentally-challenged person like Leonard). Notably, Memento doesn't follow popular philosophies and wasn't so ignorant about that fact.9/10, very impressive and compelling, needed instructions for young audiences.",9,0,2,30 January 2010
Inglourious Basterds," It's not for everyone, but it's QT in his finest hour.
","This might be, by any means, my favorite QT movie so far. Maybe that's because I have also made quite some progress by myself, but I still like to give Inglorious Basterds two thumbs up.It's QT in his purest form, and in his finest hour. Before the movie's release, medias had quite some good time chatting about Brad Pitt's involvement and the controversy the movie aroused up. All these are good signs for those investors, since Inglorious Basterds have triumphed in the box office already. However, Brad Pitt is not the point of the movie. His performance is manageable but not top-notch, yet he's still funny in almost every scene. On the other hand, the supporting cast are the real stars. Christoph Waltz as the sophisticated, sadistic schemer Col. Hans Landa is not to be missed. Unlike a lot of Nazis portrait, he's a mixture between a stereotypical Nazi and a smart farce. Actually, that can also be the summary of the entire film. The one who faced him off was Melane Laurent, whose performance was very impressive in terms of dimensions and details. In some shots, she looked extremely like Tobey Maguire(no kidding). And, I have to mention Diane Kruger, who have never been so brilliant in front of the camera. QT really has some talents to squeeze the potential out of those actors and actress.......The movie did not try to break through in terms of cinematographic or the camera movements, which means they are good as usual like all the other QT movies. Still, some scenes are ingenious. The final scene was mostly technically-persuasive. In some way, this is also the most stationary movie QT made, since the 90% the conversation was in foreign language and there were not so many casual sequences like in Death Proof or Reservoir Dogs.Concerning Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds can be considered as its sequel, but more expensive, a lot bloodier and even more over-the-top. Like RD, IB is not for everyone. It's not a good movie to take your kids to. It's also definitely not the best family movie if you consider to take you 80-year-old grandma to. But it's so over-the-top on the dramatic side and comedy side as well. If you don't totally hate it, the efforts put into the screenplay will show you how to turn the greatest war fought in human history into a satire. The lies and tricks set in the beginning of the movie as well as in every chapter's beginning will automatically catch you. Later it naturally catches you off-guard. You may care for all the characters in the movie and even sob for their fates, but you just can't help laughing out at the idiotic status of every climax. The whole thing reached a new peak in the final chapter of the movie, which told some truths about the humanity.....If I expose any bit of the story, it will not make such a surprise for you. Let's describe it this way, you saw the first 3 minutes and assumed it would be very serious, but later you found the underlying mockeries in it. The intentional jokes are obvious to catch and are all funny. But when you walk out of the cinema and recalled the way Hitler acted, and think about the whole idea again, you will laugh your butts off.Liked it very much, one of the most satisfying movies of the year. I bet 3 Oscars on it. 10/10. QT is becoming more an more careful and bold at the same time. Bravo!",10,8,21,27 August 2009
Iron Man 2," I am almost satisfied.
","For the record, I gave Iron Man 1 a solid 8.4, for all the calibers and brilliance it delivered. Now with Iron Man 2 I gave it 7.3. Here are my reasons.1, The comedy still plays out pretty good with Downey's performance well utilized. Though some of the jokes were not as genuine as the original. Jon Favreau's approach of mixing sci-fi action with comedy still works, that's maybe the best news for fans and non-fans alike. Fortunately, they didn't follow Transformers 2's formula 'bigger the better' or we will see some serious disasters. We still have these jaws-dropping dynamic action sequences which are well controlled and edited. The F1 track one was definitely one of the best crafted sci-fi fighting scenes, almost with a nostalgic feeling attached to it(light saber becomes light whip?)The climax is as big as one can imagine, but there comes the shortcomings. The first Iron Man was so charming to me mainly because as the movie processes, audiences were sucked into Tony's mind of tech geek and crazy stuffs. The scenes with Tony testing all the parts of his design were pricelessly detailed and looked genuine, like you can touch this technology and really invite it into your kitchen someday. But Iron Man 2 was too busy telling a more complex story, giving up all the opportunities exploring more facets of a crazy inventor. So on so forth.2, Terrence Howard was a better Rhodes, delivering charms by himself or charmed the audiences by being the buddy/nanny for Tony. Don Cheadle feels so serious that he never gave this charming awkwardness as heartfelt as Howard. Beginning with him, I perceived several problems with the supporting characters. Having Scarlett Johnson kicking human asses is a smart move, but she doesn't feel entirely immersed with the Iron Man atmosphere (especially when she fought with security guards while Tony fights robots). The villains, however, are weak. Hammer is supposed to be a genuine idiot, with too much ego and too little brain to be in the pentagon. His ideas are never fit into the Iron Man technology, that's what the movie has successfully illustrated with the climax. With that in mind, one can expect any goofy acts from him. Sadly, he spent too much time on the screen and made him almost like pretending to be an idiot(not mainly due to Sam Rockwell's performance). On the opposite, audiences may find Mickey Rourke much more delicious to watch. He's a total bad-ass with an attitude. Beneath that, he's also a heartless technology maniac(typical villain from Russia). Except the 124 minutes of running time had mostly underused him, portraying him to be someone largely inferior to every aspects of Iron Man(overly obsessed with whip-type of weapons,keep making the same mistake,etc.) Somehow I was expecting him to be the key of saving Tony, but I was wrong because the makers can't wait to get Nick Fury back on screen, and made the story logically plausible but not structurally remarkable.My friend, who also loves movies, remarked that he didn't want to see Iron Man 2 because it's 'too predictable as they bring some bad-ass robot toe-to-toe with Tony Stark and Tony wins'. I told him that's not the point of any popcorn movies or superhero movies, but I guess he's not totally wrong with this one. Nevertheless, Iron Man 2 still boasts with masterful polishing and will most probably be nominated best special effects by Oscar. Enjoy your party with Tony Stark!",7,3,6,10 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Honestly done, with all elements promoted, however not flawless
","Wow the 3rd on the all-time worldwide box-office? You must be joking me! With such thoughts I went to see this big-budget, monster-cast, rumors-filling and long film.My first impression is that I am forced into the plot comparing to the first one, in which I could develop a sense of the sail ship era and the real life of the pirates. It seems the director has his own confidence in making this one only to the fans to make money(and he succeeded, in such an abundant way). Now it is the consequence of Mr. Will Turner and his bride's actions in the end of the first film, very realistic.On the other hand, Jack has also escaped again in his cool and stylish way. But Jack's part meeting up with Old Turner is not so smooth. Such kind of strange feeling of the lines and the story-telling keeps coming up in the next two hours. For example the joke of cannibals chasing the dog, to me, is a little like a TV commercial. So does the chest-robbing scene. The characters and their behaviors are not driven by the story but simply driven by the need to amuse the audience with new tricks(like the big wheel fighting).However, if you are doubting about my rating of this film, you are probably wrong. Let me speak it in this way: all those action-comedy actors like Charlie Chaplin, Jackie Chan and Gene Kelly would be awed by it. Dead Man's Chest is a conclusion and new avant-garde of its genre. It absorbed all the potentials in the Chaplin movies and Jackie Chan movies, and deserves the respect of other movie makers. The whole effect of the film has came out to be as viewable as LoTR. All the small pieces and beautiful scenes will prove your praise as to not only relax but also enlighten your eyes. It is honestly done.The performances are also awesome. Orlando Bloom has for the first time amused me with his emotional act. Will Turner turned out to be a man standing on his own feet rather than some sort of lady-killer. I don't need to mention Johnny Depp but he did it again with all the means I can imagine and with so many means that I can't imagine. I have to admit he is a genius. So far, almost all the elements have been promoted. what did I miss? Oh, yes. The jokes. Some jokes really got me, like in the beginning when Will landed on the cannibal island, a parrot said to him, 'don't eat me.' And Will replied misunderstandingly, 'I'm not gonna eat you.' This is a smart one that you may be smart enough to prophet the following scene, yet I laughed for a while. Visual effects? I bet $1 on its Academy Award of Best Visual Effects 2007, for I already felt like to have a bite on Dick Jones' face(it must tastes good:) Overall, if you already read so much of my review, you can forget about my spoiler in the beginning. Happy new year 2007!",9,3,6,29 December 2006
12 Angry Men," 1957 is a miracle year.
","Despite all the other great events and movies I may not know, since I was born in the 80's, I was awed by the two greatest productions of this year. The bridge on the river Kwai and 12 Angry Men. Both of them has enough power to blow you out of your mind and possibly your seat, but hopefully not your window :) This production is of course not a very big one, not involving any CGI or action sequences. But, it just proved again a movie should essentially be justified by its story, not the visual effects, unless you can make all the visual effects a part of the movie, which will not be discussed here. 12 Angry Men is, to my surprise, not really a 'court' movie, but instead, a jury room movie. 99% of the story was told in the same room, showing 12 men talking with each other in probably the real time. When I realized this, I was fearing the next 90 minutes could be a boring torture. But I was sooooo wrong.The interactions of all the characters are simply awesome. Henry Fonda is not less and not more than what he intends to be--a good guy. Thruogh the 90 minutes all he was doing was to bring justice and truth back to the eyes of jury, I was surprised by how advanced the director's cinematographic and editing were. The atmosphere of the jury room got more and more intense and it seemed the truth and righteousness was being enforced by some unseen hands. people may become stubborn, some of the jury even was so negligent that they never really cared about the death and life of the accused. But, this is still not the concentration of the movie. The movie, is a 1 and a half hours miracle about fate being changed, not about stubborn people's mind being changed.Simply brilliant. And truly meaningful. The movie inspires people in many ways, including being a good man, which is most wanted in this century, I mean the 21st century.10/10.",10,0,0,11 April 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Sadly, it spent too much time being run-of-the-mill.
","I tend to feel Prince of Persia the movie owed me a watchable story, after paying 140 Baht(more than average in Thai cinemas) and two unremarkable hours in the digital cinema. I also tend to doubt the possibility this movie will ever speak to you with any messages, should them be fairy tale messages or serious politic messages. That being said, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is quite a disappointment from a bunch of names I admired.The Parkour sequences were fun to watch, so was the siege sequence, but if you have watched the trailer, you've seen them all. It's never really captivating. You got eye candies, just like you've got Dastan and Princess Tamina, but you've also got terrible performances and disturbing character background illustration. That part that talked about Tamina's coronation as the Sand prophet was so hilariously bad that I almost laughed out. What was more hilarious was her character's development after the flashback, that Tamina transformed magically from a cursing,sarcastic-talking person into a religiously holified person......I guess the movie's intrinsically bad because of the script, that they tried to please all the demographic groups so they had to forgo all the valid, culture-identifying messages. The CGI landscapes of ancient Persia spent many millions, yet never succeeded in giving you anything material. The story had Dastan started in the slum, and granted him a heart of gold that cemented sibling love as the only thing that's closest to a 'soul' in this hollow story. Unfortunately, the most emotional role who also provided the best fighting sequence is not our prince, but some 'knife thrower'.I gave the movie 6/10 out of the respect for Ben Kinsley having very dark eyeliner, and the final act that somehow managed to save this movie. What I like to talk more about is the potential it wasted in this great context. With human dreams to go back in time to fix mistakes, sands as the symbol of infinite bleakness/lifelessness, exotic locations with exotic tales, POP the movie could have told you a story, favorably in a fable style, just like the original games. Yet it misused the knife of time, made the prince an underachiever in almost every remarkable aspects in the original game, and tell you craps like 'some souls are bound beyond time'. Time-traveling in a fantasy context was great, at least in Groundhog Day, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and the Sands of Time games.For the record, The Two Thrones gave you great opportunities to recognize and reflex on your own dark sides, and suggested you to choose the way of repent rather than the way of chasing shadows. Are mainstream audiences really so secular that they can't even stand fables with a bit biblical touch? Or are they only being awed enough to respect some environmentalism because Avatar had awesome visuals? I doubt it, and I strongly believe someone can make a much-better POP movie that is really epic.",6,16,31,14 June 2010
Oldboy," Superior exploration about sins in a surreal context.
","First off, the entire movie won't happen in reality, as it was invented in the Japanese manga form and adapted into this hyped movie, probably the most hyped Korean movie ever. Those good qualities were already mentioned too many times by other reviews so I'd save mine in terms of technology, film-noir approach and creativity in action scenes. Those were all very much the sample of movie making. However, the real gem of this movie lies elsewhere. The movie is seemingly the protagonist's revenge story, who was imprisoned for 15 years and was framed for murdering his own wife when he was in the prison. Experiencing illusions, desperation, suicides and many obstacles, Dae-su was finally released from the stinking private prison. Just like destiny, he came to a sushi shop where a mysterious girl developed an affection for him. Later, the girl took the fainted dae-su home and treated him.With the girl's help, Dae-su began his road of revenge in searching for the enemy. The problem was, Dae-su's early life was full of bloody debts, so where to start?The story, executed in a way full of details and colors, which reflect the many characters' mind and memory, their desperation and loneliness. It doesn't deal with social problem directly. In fact, the social context in this movie is entirely emittable, which had very little to do with the story. Only in the beginning of the plot we see Dae-su in the police station pissing off every police officers. Later in the movie, no matter how many people Dae-su defeated, or how many died in the carnage, no law was forced on the responsibilities. Even Dae-su's imprisonment was not directly related to some social problem, but related to purely refined 'Sin' described in the movie. The movie is seemingly trying to rationalize or legalize Dae-su's bloody personal war against the one archenemies, but implying again and again that Dae-su was keep missing things that matter. In many places, Dae-su had the choice to escape with his newly-found lover, who's maybe 28 years his junior, but his mind was so obsessed with revenge. After he found out about the truth of his imprisonment and all the revenging plan, the morality came out only as an ultimate punishment which turned the situation upside down. Dae-su's exploration of sins didn't end with the fact that his new 'lover' is actually his reconciled daughter after all the 15 years. Lately, without the archenemies, Dae-su asked the hypnotist to modify his memory so he wouldn't know about his daughter and his misdeeds. However, he couldn't forget anything yet he had to accept the daughter who already took him as a lover. So we can summarize the flow chart of the sin in the movie.Sin 1 is Woo-jin's sex with his own sister. The 2nd sin committed that is significant is Dae-su's rumor about Woo-jin and his sister messing with each other. Later, this sin grew stronger when everyone talks about it. It finally triggered woo-jin's sister committing suicide because the rumors gave her a fake-pregnant symptom. Woo jin committed the 3rd sin by letting sister fall off the cliff. Revenge 1 is a direct reaction to sin 2, which imprisoned Dae-su and killed his wife; but when Dae-su came out of prison, he immediately revenge(revenge 2) and in which process, committed sin 4 which is having sex with his own daughter. But since he has to finish revenge 2, revenge 1 and 2 reconciled him and Woo-jin, giving him the truth about his daughter, which completed Revenge 1, which in return made Revenge 2 meaningless. Woo-jin finally committed suicide(sin 4) which is the direct effort of sin 3. Although Dae-su survived, he didn't have hope to be forgiven(or forgiving himself) and tried to forget the past(sin 4) but failed. Therefore, he had to live along with sin 4 and let the daughter bear sin 4 as well, surviving the cruel world......So, it's quite clear that the original sinner and the final sinner were both Dae-su, punished by his sins until his death. Nowadays, very few movies have such concentration and explosion in each scene to awe the audiences, yet completely ignoring the social context and the legal system. The Old Boy did this and told a top-notch revenge story that is as dramatic and Sweeny Todd, yet stylish enough like Devil May Cry. It definitely gave me some lessons in making movies.",8,1,3,1 August 2009
Black Book," Bold, fast and delivering, with one of my favorite female lead.
","Basically what's gonna blow you away in the Dutch production 'Black Book' is its individual narration presenting one near-perfect performance by the Dutch actress, Carice Von Houten. Regarding Jews in the 2nd world war, it's neither The Pianist nor Shindler's List. Instead, it's quite a mixture of the two movies, and fortunately a mixture of the good elements from the two.Ellis was being hidden by a Dutch family in their farmhouse. However, after the house had been bombed, she had to escape to Belgium with the help of a Dutch resistant member. They were exposed and all her family were killed in the slaughter. Being the only one luckily enough to escape the carnage, Ellis had a chance to join the resistance and spy on the Germans.In the process she only discovered the truth of her family's tragedy.......The story is not very complicated, but you will be entirely impressed by the way they tell the story. The whole presentation centers the lead character, Ellis. The audiences will enjoy the exploration of many topics in a chaos world and time. There is romance between the female spy and the German officer she spied on; there is also social comments regarding the morality of people in the war. But they are all presented in the first-person view so they were all correctly stressed, decorated and executed. There are countless nude scenes throughout the movie, but they never stand against the plot or jeopardize the integrity of the movie. On the contrast, all the nudity, torture and these elements are smart compliments to the story because they were all stitched by one of my favorite female lead in all movies, Ellis.Ellis was quick, smart and always had the potential to escape the worst situations. She's also passionate and sympathetic. But the main feature of her is her uniquely strong personality. Heroine is not precise here because she didn't really do something heroic. However, she was always shining in every single scene. The audiences will find it mostly easy to root for her because she's so likable. Carice Von Houten completely sink into her character, or she herself is really such a bold and enthusiastic person as Ellis. In my opinion she deserved an Oscar.Generally, you will remember this movie.9/10",9,4,9,20 February 2009
Alexander," They should have made it a cartoon
","Oliver Stone? An epic movie of the greatest king Alexander? Come on! I really really admire you, Oliver. I admire the movies you made in the 1980s. I love JFK so much that I really can't believe this 'epic' you made.How much did they spend to make this big movie with such an expensive cast including Angelina Julie, Hopkins and Val Kilmer? Maybe this is the only reason for some people to see this one, I believe. But did they worth it? Hmmm... Maybe. If you like watching some Brad Pitt style performance by Colin the boy, you will like it somehow. But the problem is there are really too many colors which are so abused in the movie. Everything seems unrealistic, maybe the director spent too much in telling some trivia like the source of 'monkey'. But if you can't feel any distance between India and Babylon, how could you be satisfied with the discovery of monkey? I'm wondering if those gore scene about elephants should be cut due to the animal-protecting law.I'm also wondering if all the so-forced porno scenes could really amuse the audience.After all, they should have made it a cartoon with so many colors and so unrealistic battle scenes involved. And if so, it would have been awesome.",6,0,0,30 July 2006
Terminator Salvation," It deserved better reviews, although it's too much like Equilibrium.
","Saw it in Bangkok last Sunday. The first impression: the negative reviews don't do this film justice.Before seeing it, I was expecting nothing but a series of relentless, silly action. But the actions itself came out to be much more than that. Compared to the other two big budget actioners(Wolverine and Star Trek), the special effects in the movie are more genuine and never compromised the film's credibility. All the stunts and terminators' mechanics are well combined and polished NEATLESSLY by CGI. All the action sequences are well placed and nearly perfectly choreographed. They may be intentionally compared with the old Terminator films on the aspect of originality. But let's say it's 21st century and Terminator should learn to fit the audiences on certain new standards.Terminator Salvation is quite a surprise from a director famous for bad movies like Charlie's Angels. Again TS is not compromising at all. It succeeded in bringing John Connor to life as THE war hero. The first two movies took great advantage of the formula of sending a cyborg to past to eliminate John Connor. The audiences can blend the fear for the post-apocalypse future and the cyborg crisis in a modern time in their mind. However the formula didn't work the 3rd time as the time-line of the movie marched forward and audiences found it difficult to follow all those time traveling paradox stuff(especially in the TV series). In previous entries, the adult John Connor was simply a plot tool who wields USA national flag and takes for granted human's victory. This, however, becomes a major hinder of new entries in the series. It seemed to the audiences that John Connor would never grow up into that anticipated savior in bone and flesh. The screenwriter had definitely done their homework on deciding Connor's role in this movie. They finally figured a way out for the series--tuning him down. This is really very wise because it gave Connor more space to develop and brought the details around him to a level of credibility. Yet, the wiser thing is that Connor is not the core character. This may give you a minor let down because you'd expect something out of Christian Bale. However, he merely gave something similar to Batman plus a little more dry speech, dry shouting, helpless sense. Not his fault anyway. The movie's core character is Marcus the Terminator, who thinks he's a human. Sam Worthington presents Marcus with heart and worth a nod.The only drawback of the film is the plot is a little too much like Equilibrium, which ironically also stars Christian Bale. The whole idea of the resistance wanted to end the war once and for all plus Skynet's conspiracy of using Marcus as an unconscious spy is totally recognizable. Even the twist get unfolded in the same way as Equilibrium, by showing you a changing CGI face on a big screen. Still, this is a forgivable flaw and the movie is well directed to the conclusion.8/10 A must-see in the summer.",8,4,7,2 June 2009
L.A. Confidential," An abandoned cinema gem sung by many, kicked away by Titanic.
","1998 should be a memorable year not only because of the 11 Oscars sweep by the monstrous Titanic, but also because of an abandoned cinema gem that comes out and went away like a gentlemen. That is L.A.Confidential.The parallel storytelling used in this movie were never so fresh and intelligent. If you notice, the 3 cops were all portrayed out of an order, in separate scenes of reconciled scenes. This perfectionist technical undertone gave this movie a perfect presentation of a good novel in every aspect. To note, the camera moves fluently and was so rich in detail that you'd need 10 or more viewings to fetch everything intended. The mystery, although entirely implied and unfolded until the very last moments, was mounted up in a most entertaining way that the director actually achieved a balance between popular entertainment and subtle/intelligent arts. All in all, the presentation itself is a miracle and worth a viewing.Unlike most crime saga, L.A.Confidential assumed the role of a watchdog, a whistle-blower and an entertainer just like the 3 roles Crowe, Spacey and Pearce had in the story. While I recommended the Dark Knight only to those 20 years and older, I recommend this to 15 years and older because it will give them some very good lessons as a person who's about to enter the society. In other words, if interpreted properly, it can be really educating. Rarely could a detective story reflect the racial problem, corruption problem and the unhappy side of a golden age so detailed and realistically. Everything has a smell of 1950's thanks to the superb art decoration.The characters, are all memorable that I could even recite their lines scene by scene. Sargeant Bud White was all women-beaters' nightmare, but he's also a cheap asset who do the muscle job and didn't ask questions--a watchdog. Sargeant Jack Vincennes was an entertainer who enjoyed his little affiliation with Hollywood and utilized every opportunity filling his own self-filled respect and honor.Sargeant Ed Exley the whistle-blower/politician had no muscle or affiliation therefore must work his own way up to the attention of his Captain, the sophisticated Dudley Smith. For each of the 3 main cops, they've got their definitive little details, expressions and moments. Their early stories were all wrapped up in an exaggerated tone told by Sid Huggins' Hush-Hush magazine, realizing their run-of-the-mill status. Later in the movie, their interactions became some of the greatest moments in the movie history. The undertone dropped to a downright reality and dynamics, giving all the threads more fun too see. Well, I still want to talk about human nature portrayed, just that would consume all your time. So enjoy it by your self.It's been 12 years since its release and it's still ranking high in Top 64 on top 250. Another 12 years will only make it even more shiny. It's not a cult classic, but it's the greatest detective movie with a lot to think about. If anyone wants to appreciate techniques and performance, one should head for French Connection or Chinatown. If one wants to appreciate techniques, performances, musics, beauties and an up-beating story which delivers a practical/positive message using the darkest context, go for L.A.Confidential. Hush-hush! P.S. the scene with Lynn Bracken and Ed Exley was surveyed and represented in many English-learning programs, despite all the flexible usage of profanities.",10,5,9,1 August 2009
Yes Man," A lot of likable characters plus a thoughtful story.
","A lot of likable characters plus a thoughtful story. Apparently the movie is everything I didn't expect. It appeared to be a little too stereotypical when I saw the trailer. The protagonist got a dead-end life, and a chance of change just came in the form of a mental seminar. It sounds a lit too alike those 'don't believe the cheap American dream' style of story. So I was expecting the 'spiritual teacher' to turn out a cult hierarch who drives people into his whatever-magnitude conspiracy. And Jim Carrey's gonna do something to stop him. How stereotypical I was.The story, implied by the plot outline on this site, was a self-exploration story which is relevant to us, everyone who's in a dead-end status quo on this planet. But it offered more, it's written with heart and the performances deserved many praises. The story managed to pull the brake at perfect timings before it's gone totally crazy for several times. Finally it turned out to be both hilarious and inspiring. It got the message delivered that those straight-minded people really deserved more care, understanding and guidance. Yet it's not really selling any tin-can theory on the big screen. The final moments are very well done. It could be one of the best comedic ending I've ever seen.Carrey's comfortable in the title role, though I am not sure if he was totally comfortable with everything he was asked to do during filming. Zooey did a her part and stole the show every single time she's on screen, not only for her hot appearance, but also for her comedian talents. Anyway audiences could be mislead by the trailer and skip it, but the movie's better than its trailer, and that's a rare thing in the industry today.Well, there are some awkward moments, and all of them are related to an elder woman who tried to seduce Jim everyday. When I watched it, I shook my head and thought that's the only thing overdone. the makers managed to set the tones right and got the movie a PG-13 rating, but IMO that single scene could get the movie an R. Anyway the whole movie's too mature for a 13-years-old.8 stars, if they delete or alter the scene I mentioned I'd give it 9.",8,3,4,20 June 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Father-absent series: Pan's Labyrinth
","When the good doctor asked him why he was so sure his unborn baby was a boy, he simply said 'Don't mess with me.' He deliberately instructed the doctor to save the baby if the childbirth goes into trouble. He regularly gains strength and faith from a cracked watch left by his father, who broke the watch to acknowledge the child his time of death. Upon defeated, his final wish is the same of his father's, but was answered by 'He(the baby boy) won't even know your name' and a bullet in the face. It was a demise the audiences felt he deserved much earlier because he's a perfect Nazi, spreading inhuman evil with his dreading presence. He likes to sense with you, but prefers more striking demonstrations which advertise his insane ego. Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen evil fathers, but you haven't seen something so implying as a father, even he's practically only a stepfather.This review intends to explore how the 'absence of father' can affect stories, human minds and essentially, our souls. Please also refer to other reviews in 'Father-absent series'.If the ways of our fathers were wrong, do we have a way to know it and for some chances to defy it? I tend to doubt that. C.S.Lewis said in his book The Problem of Pain that humans as we are today are not quite the same species the creator made in the first place because somehow we chose to fall from original grace. Dealing with terms of spiritual world, true definition of purity and innocence and co-existence of heaven's way and human's way, Pan's labyrinth is quite a special movie. When this movie was spreading to Asia back in 2007, the public was shocked by the sheer aesthetic value as well as a very poignant, equally brutal and fairy feeling attached to this unique experience. However, the critics, professors and young graduates alike also fell into a debate as what on earth was the director Del Toro wanted to tell us. I respect all the theories that can make their own senses, which I have no intention to dive into today. What I feel compelled to find out is the movie's implications on a higher level.Despite the movie's offer of high production values especially those great nature views, the visuals are all wrapped by a haunting loneliness, helplessness and confusion. Ofelia's father died in the bombing, her mother was forced to marry a monster for surviving. The only real father she got was in the children's book. Despite all the goodwill from this fantasy-inspired, heavenly-crowned God-like father, his runner/servant-angel was a 'Pan', who talks in riddles and assign Ofelia with dangerous missions to return to heaven's heritage. Even the most warm-hearted woman around couldn't get a grasp of what's really happening to Ofelia, not to mention those self-crowned, tyrannical men. It's never this clear a message, 'there are no men anymore in this world but male monsters in men's shape'. Translated into my real world, am I really so different from Captain Vidal? For the record, I don't kill people like having breakfast, and I don't torture people like enjoying butter on a toast. No, I've killed no one with my hands, but I've killed in my mind. Why? Because I am a male human. I loved to allow my anger to rape my sadness, awkwardness and goodwill to apologize and rebuild relationships. It's been years for me, decades for my father, thousands of years for talented Oriental men looking for a perfect flag to devote our blood to and worship our egos in. More importantly, I, like Captain Vidal himself, enjoyed the temporary alliance of my ancestors' honor and my own pride, thus also the power and justification to reign over weaker, more obedient groups. That's the lawful way to grow your pride and ego, and to carry on one's family line especially in traditional Oriental families. Ironically, as a Christian now, I still feel the need to grow in this way sometimes, and often felt beaten by womanizers and smarter people who I tend to look down upon. Luckily, now I know it's a dead road, a highway to the hell.Captain Vidal's army was triumphed over by brave guerrillas, but his way of killing wasn't. Of the worldly terms, Ofelia doesn't have to save his baby brother from anyone because no one intends to kill him. Of worldly terms, Ofelia died a foolish death, a death so fatefully descends upon her just like the male monster Vidal always have wanted. Pan's final task for Ofelia was far less difficult in physical terms, but intrinsically more difficult for a species that already betrayed its creator. I tend to believe it's not Ofelia's love for her little brother that bought her a ticket to heaven. I believe it's Ofelia's decision to let the heavenly father's way to carry on her rather than the world's way, as illustrated by all the explosions in the backdrop.In the end, one side is the haunting escalation of violence. The survivors only have the chance to sob upon the dead, after all the bullets hit their destinations, after all the people killed the ones they wanted to kill. On the other side, Ofelia reclaimed princess and reunion with her family. It's only a movie of course, so I don't see the necessity to go into debates as 'which side is essentially the reality'.But for real,is there a heaven? do we believers reunion in heaven? I think it's a question better asked when one's got experience, wealth, health, reasons, intelligence all striped down to zero. It's a question better asked when one has a Bible in his hand which one can turn to Gospel of John chapter 14 verse 2 to 3. It's also a question better asked when one's willing to let our heavenly father's spirit, his way and truth running inside one's soul.",9,1,9,15 June 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Great modern musical, visually stunning and musically satisfying
","Before I went to see this movie, I was thinking how it would come out to be. A positive portray of some psychopath killer? Or a promotion of some bloody antihero and vengeance? It worried me because my church fellows would hate to see this one for such reasons.But it came out to be very different. Yes, it's dark and make you scratch your head quite a lot. So many disturbing murderous scenes would simply make your kids cry all the way home,therefore don't take children to this movie, and don't see this movie yourself if you are mentally immature. That means, the movie is talking about paradox in revenge and danger of retaining hate ever after a tragedy, instead of promoting the idea of killing by a razor. On some level, it even looked like American History X to me. I'd like to give Tim Burton a big hand for his work of balance in the movie. Despite so twisted the characters are, so twisted the presentation and the lyrics are, it doesn't make you sick after all if you always focus on the songs. It stimulated me to buy the DVD of this one just for the musics.9/10 for all the performances of the wonderful cast and for musics.",9,0,1,3 February 2008
Shutter Island," Don't be freaked out by this movie, yet.
","Spoiler alert first. This review is only intended for those who finished watching Shutter Island.First off, if you were freaked out by this movie, congratulations! You just became a new guinea pig after a few millions people who just saw it. My suggestion is, think again. Don't just resort to questioning your own sanity like some serious viewers. That's because the masterful Martin Scorsese pulled out a masterful magic trick in narrating, and fooled you into a psycho's shoes. The settings, atmosphere,performances, character studies are all fascinating, yet mind-provoking. The final twist will have no less effects than great psychological thrillers like Fight Club, Psycho, etc. That's also why I gave it a bow and a 9/10 on IMDb.Though the movie definitely gave us a lot of details suggesting the final revelation moments, we as audiences did saw those intentionally-made hallucinations as if they are real. Also, the whole atmosphere and the fact that the ways doctors treating mental patients are not perfect also helped building up paranoia. The main character, as we get to know him and his mental scars, are also put into these series of procedures which inspire paranoia as well. Like Hitchcock's masterpieces, this movie has a great assumption that insanity is a dwelling element in our society, which we can't weave away. This revelation may help us examining the philosophies behind this movie.Like Batman Begins, the movie's theme is also very religious, 'to save or to destroy?' Such is the clashing point of the psychological doctors in the movie. It's just like an argument between an angel and a demon, yet if you watch closely enough, you will also notice that the 'demon' side in the movie,the doctors holding that brain-paralyzing surgery is the best resort are surely cold-hearted, without much of a goodwill, not to mention any kind of love toward the patient.However, the 'angel' side of the doctors are also not so good as we have come to assume. Ben Kinsley's character is essentially playing God in controlling and affecting the test subject's mind, yet the conditioning and controlling procedures in this so-called Role-playing game are marred by either lack of goodwill from the other side, or the very procedure which can torment the subject and generate some more paranoia out of him. So this story is basically a sad-sad beginning continued with a sad-sad ending, which has already been decided by the writer's pessimistic logics.I am definitely not criticizing the movie's authentication on a story level. In fact, the movie very honestly revealed one truth to us, that you only get to choose to be saved or to be destroyed in a limited time, and you won't be given another chance forever. That's because if you always ruin the chance of being redeemed, the whole life becomes a repeated torture, which is not so different from hell. Shutter Island definitely achieved in questioning the human's weak spot and make us scream inside or outside. Yet, the story lacked some very important factors, which I have been wondering since I noticed that none of the main characters revealed to have any religious belief and assumed atheists. Scorsese had been, according to my memory, mocking at or ignoring Christianity since his early movies. In this socially-concerned movie, he again showed this tendency. Simply put, simply believing in people's mind can choose to face the facts and turn to the good helpers, while factoring out God's saving grace, is a silly belief which beats itself. That's the very dilemma and failure Ben Kinsley's character met. Also, Playing God in this dreadfully set 'Role-playing-game' also beats itself because you can't even be almighty enough to control all the chess pieces, like the movie had shown.That being said, I very much like to see everyone who's frightened by the movie to relax and have a good dream. That's it.",9,3,7,26 May 2010
Gone Baby Gone," Simple story will blow you away
","The first view of the movie is for sure not enough, you will have to see it again if you want every point of your argument to be powerful and reasonable.Well, this is my short review of Gone Baby Gone, which is one of the most powerful movie of the year 2007, if you compare it to the hugely overdone Atonement. Gone baby gone simply has a meaningful message. You will sense the strong moral concerns all over the movie. In the beginning, people come to blame the drug-addicted and prostitute mom of the child. In the middle, people come to be haunted by the death of the child, just like the characters did. By the end, it is very possible for you to be involved into another argument with your friends who saw the movie with you.Although you can argue that this movie is over-dramatic and pure imagination, but I'd say it hit the points. Everyone has some haunting experiences that will lead him/her to some answer himself/herself don't want to see. And it just remind me that we should not hide from them anyway.For your children to be educated,and you.9/10",9,0,0,29 February 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Awesome movie with every minute thrilling, and forget about the camera
","First of all, let's just forget about the camera problems that a lot of people mentioned. It is not a big deal at all IMO. The fact is, the movie is directed and shot in its own style through which Greengrass wants to show a cruel and cold, fast-paced thrilling spy-world. For example, the most-criticized shots from behind Damon's shoulder is very intelligent, showing how dirty and miserable Jason Bourne's world is and how dangerous the information Bourne viewed are . I mean, it is deliberately made but not without a point. All the shaking camera scenes are affordable and wouldn't make you puke, unless you've had too much milk in the morning.I was not a very big fan of Bourne and Damon before. However this movie really made me one. The storytelling is simply clear and dramatic. Only a few filmmakers can make a no-surprising story looks so good on the big screen. The story begins with Damon being chased by Russian policemen, which is just following the climax of Bourne Supremacy, and maybe a little bit confusing at first, but will give you a surprise near the end. In the movie, Jason attempts to save a reporter, a spy-trainer and then an old friend, Nikki. However the harder he tries, the more professional killers are sent after him. Therefore the movie is filled with more actions and chasing scenes than the sum of the last two Bourne films. It will definitely be the most satisfying film by the fans of the genre.The other thing need to mention is the atmosphere of the movie. As a thriller, the story and the actions just pull up the sense of thrilling to the roof of the theater, where everybody was just stuck and astonished by the movie. Sometimes a little bit dark-humor dialogs are not bad at all. After you watch Bourne being chased for whole 15 minutes, you will find the very human side of the super spy. Seemingly he is an unstoppable killing machine. However if you pay attention to the whole trilogy, you will find Bourne's changing as an unhappy agent who is tired of killing, seeking for a narrower but right way to deal with people even those who will kill him without a second's hesitation. In Identity, he killed almost everyone who is sent to hunt him. In supremacy, he let go of the killer of his loved one, after finding him bleeding in a crashed car. In Ultimatum, you will be amused by the effect of this trend. The camera intentionally focuses on Bourne's face from time to time, showing his nervous, assertive, tough yet desperate, sad expressions. Meeting his victims' family means torture to him. The families simply presume him to be some sort of monster from another world, fearing him in every movement. However the sorrow deep inside Bourne helps compromising between them as weak humans more than enraged people with vendettas. This theme is emphasized in the second movie and becomes even more important in Ultimatum.There are so much to say about it. But I have to stop before speaking too much to spoil your appetite. In short, welcome back Bourne.10 out of 10 (to remember, this is the first 10 I gave in 3 months,and I've voted 644 titles on IMDb already)",10,1,2,15 August 2007
Watchmen," Very original presentation of an ambitious but inconsistent story.
","Suppose you see a rarely good comic-based movie like Watchmen, would you directly wish it make it to the top 250? I did, but I only give it an 8 for its inconsistency.I am not professional and it didn't take a professor in cinema to appreciate the efforts they put in this movie. The film's nostalgic style were flowing everywhere and saturated the heroes' stories and memories as well. The first 1hr 30 minutes in the extended version was so unforgivably good that everyone in the Watchmen team were as much explored and the story went on to make sense. Fighting sequences reflected the style they did in 300, which blends Matrix in a comics context, where the slums/country musics/Beatles all catch you and shock you. Cameras always assure you of the subtlety behind those funny suits, which gave me a totally different feeling than the trailer, which I mush criticize on. The public of course are willing to see another comic hero movie with all those funny suits. That must have been the publisher's idea. However, Watchmen is not about fist-fighting, it's about history changing people. So if the trailer could be a bit more nostalgic and dramatically-implying, the movie would make a lot more money. It's too dark but I am sure you can handle that after The Dark Knight.What I meant by inconsistency, is not as severe as those movies like Punisher the war-zone or so. The problem is the forced-up climax and conclusion. It's a little forced for all the audiences to see the real motives of Ozimandias and to accept his holocaust treatment that supposedly solved the conflicts between Soviet Union and USA. The message 'who will watch the watchmen' was beautifully delivered with the experience of all the superheroes portrayed, but fell short of realistic touch, which was like a gem in the first half. To show the difference between Rorschach and Night-owl, the director intentionally killed Rorschach using Dr. Manhattan. This is to show how the powerful people bend the worldly rules, which even worked for a semi-god like Dr. Manhattan. Still this could be very rigid that Dr. Manhattan's motives would seem manipulated. Yet, Ozymandias was too confident in making all the moves and all the watchmen in the final scene became like retarded-men who didn't think twice. Rorschach's journal should be a good lead for a sequel but the scale, the spectacular and the phenomenon will need much more efforts...... Again, Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II wasn't explored enough and the audiences didn't feel much of her feeling knowing the Comedian was her father or so, which makes the ending even more ridiculous.Well, the director was talented, some scenes, specially those tragic moments were most memorable. However, the inconsistency should really be fixed by more patience.Anyway, I liked it. 8/10",8,0,2,1 August 2009
Cast Away," Culture Shock Series: Cast Away.
","There was an earthquake in Sino 1978, when the government decided to open the gate of the country and allow the free trade and economics. That marks the first wave of material renaissance in Far East. That's something you can easily check from any history books nowadays, but what you probably won't find in the books is the sentimental values of people at that time. When Sino people had their very first color TV, first Teddy bear, first turbo washing machine, they attached their feelings to them, only to find out there are far better quality of products out there waiting for them. Into the 1990s, they are all confused because there's no clearer boundary between good communism and bad capitalism. Former garbage and treasures now exchanged ID cards. Now in 2010s, despite one's denial of his/her lost status, we are all castaways.The image Cast Away portrayed with Tom Hanks is quite simple, an everyday man was the sole survivor on a coral island, and the only friend he got was volleyball. People take an interest in seeing this movie for questioning our take-for-granted identity of human being, etc. However, the true controversy off the screen comes from the ever-clever product placement in it, that the storyline actually is one huge super commercial for Fed Ex, Wilson sports, and some other brands. Whoever wrote the script must be a genius. Yet, we as conscious, commercial-spoiled human beings are questioning something beyond Chuck Noland's humanity issues. That is, is there ever a point of rooting your sentimental values on mass-produced products? How about actually hug the values provided by your everyday Coke commercials and such? I am afraid no one will go to bed with a Wilson volleyball even after seeing Cast Away, but I am quite sure there are people who get frustrated when they find out half their life was devoted to something equally lifeless as Wilson.My first guess is the value system everyone possesses in this world. Taking mine for example, my system told me the most valuable existence in my life was those time with my family, especially when I was only a child who's not ashamed asking for a hug every minutes. But, that's the answer I got when I was older and things can't be same ever again. When I was 18 years old, I had my favorite computer, Nintendo game console and my admission letter from a University. My value system told me at that time the most valuable in my life was again something from the past, the moment I celebrated my manhood with best friends, the family and hometown I am about to say goodbye to, etc. There can be many explanations to this stupidity. For me, it would be immaturity because I was a teenager at the time. However, the moment my father saw me off the way to the university at the train station, he also felt his life was pumped out into a vacuum after parting with me. For months and years this vacuum was choking him so harsh...... Another explanation would be an uneven value system. That we do not have multiple types of wealth that can balance out if one goes wrong. I graduated from finance major, so I personally like this explanation as it sounds slightly more scientific and economic. However, the dilemma presented to me again was like this: as an atheist, I accept 'we are here and now only' values. But again, any reasonable, self-respected realists would end up in a paradox, that any wealth in the long run is perishable so there's no need to raise a family(remember you may end up like Chuck Noland that your wife accepted your death when you are just missing), there's no need either to plan for your living, etc. Then in a month or two, the wreckage of your consciousness and health would be warning that you are walking drunk and sleeping in death.But you won't be that ignorant. Like Chuck Noland you will finally learn to pick yourself up and find something to behold. Luckier than Noland, besides volleyball we've got football, the world cup, Beckham's tattoo, NBA, and what we IMDb guys like the most, movies. You can even make a ranking list to value them like I did. I listed God as No.1, and that's predetermined because otherwise my pastor's going to have a serious conversation with me. Then, it didn't take very long for me to find out whatever was at No.2 in my authenticated value system tends to overthrow the God. Matthew 13:44: 'The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.' It finally appeared to me that a value system I made that had God on the highest ranking doesn't work. Instead, a value system put into me by God would be beyond my reasoning. It asked me to put behind everything and accept him and him only. As a sinner, I have run away from this answer several times.The enormous ocean washed up Chuck Noland. His passion, his 5 years of life, his family and every other thing possibly he owned in his value system. What proved to be waterproof in his heart was pain and loneliness. What would bring him salvation? I don't know because this is only a movie, a world conceived in people's mind, which may or may not have the concept of salvation at all. But I know his pain and loneliness can't be more real than ours. And, it doesn't seem like a value system dilemma to me anymore. It seems more like a dilemma of soul. On one side, it's the brooding and evolving sin, still escalating in the time-line, while on the other side is Holy Spirit's unchanged whispering prayers for us, echoing in the eternity.",8,3,4,16 June 2010
North by Northwest," Fine espionage comedy, simple ideas and good making
","If you turn on your TV and see this one, don't switch. Remind yourself that this is made in 1959, almost half a century ago. Then when you are watching Gary Grant running away from the plane, don't forget to close your mouth. You will probably say 'wow!' There is so much to say about the movie. In the very beginning we see two old man--the 60-year-old director Hitchcock and the 58-year-old Gary Grant. But neither of them seemed dumb as Roger Moore in A View To A Kill. You will not sense the danger until Gary was forced to drink, and you will probably even develop a feeling of 'silly' in the movie. But the plot was so brilliant that it will keep you concentrating to the end of the film.The encounter with Eve was not bad, but not better than the former Hitchcock movies either. Fortunately the script didn't corrupted on the beauty. The part that the plane chases Gary was unforgettable. So does the Rushmore climb.There aren't many special effects to support the fun of optical. However watching Gary Grant in the very brilliant editing and conversations is really full of fun.The movie is not flawless. But believe me this one deserves the 8.6 in the position of top 26.",8,0,1,4 September 2006
Wanted," Gradually waking up from an erotic action dream.
","'Wanted' is a decent-made action movie, with a mystery waiting to be unfolded by the audiences, which will essentially lead the movie to be reflective.Due to my bad habit of making comparisons between a movie and its trailer, I'd like to say it gave me mixed feeling. First of all, my expectation is too high, when I wanted it to be like a top-notch John Woo slow-motion flick. 'Wanted' came out like that, but the director is not John Woo after all. Here are the goods and bads about it.The good: 1, a solid story. Excelled my expectation, Wanted has something to say. It is a great father-son relationship story. At first it arouse up the audiences into the mood of brainless killers, then subsequently cool them down to let them think. The writers are very smart not to ruin the storyline in the gunfires but to develop it into something else. 'I want actions to be driven by story, not story driven by actions.'Said John Woo some years ago. Wanted is a good example of that.2, While brains are kept being blown out, the movie kept a balance between a black comedy and a mystery thriller. There is no forced romance, even though Angelina Jolie gave many erotic appearances. Concerning Angelina, she has to be mentioned as she gave a good performance, even with very few lines. The rest of the cast is also good. Morgan Freeman deserved a nod absolutely.3, The actions. The first third of the movie has enough potential to be another Matrix. But that's also what let me down consequently.The bad: The second part of the movie is half-narrative, half-action-packed, but the third part finally slowed down. After the breathtaking train scene, the mystery is solved and everyone is waiting for some explosive final shoot-out. But the actions after that are no match for the former parts of the movie. What a pity! It could have been better than Equilibrium, it could have been better than so many action classics if it has a better climax. Maybe it's meant to be anti-climax...About the message of the movie, I'd like to say it's an ironic encouragement to everyone who is not satisfied with the environment. 'Choose your destiny' could be something deceitful, and being a good child of the society could be the luckiest thing for you and me.7/10 Had some laugh with friends in theater. Enjoyed it.",7,5,14,27 June 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Father-absent series: Terminator 2.
","The moment T-800 took John Connor with one arm and bosom-ed him against his leather jacket, I knew it's cozy, safe to be in there. Why? Because my dad used to put me in his bosom and ride me home on his bicycle. If all the CGI and camera work made Terminator 2 way ahead of its time, then it was the stubborn terminator who refused to die again and again made this movie nearly timeless.This review along with other reviews in the 'Father-absent series', intends to explore how the absence of fathers affects people's mind and spirits, in and out of movies.Terminator 2 is the kind of movie that reminds you why you love to see movies. As an enthusiastic fan of the series I bought DVD-9 deluxe set the moment it's released. After maybe 3-4 viewings it again bothered me as what did I own when I say I have this DVD. Do I own the 120 million dollars of budget making T-1000 alive on the screen? No. Do I own the finest hour of Arnold's career? Nope. Maybe even Arnold didn't really enjoy being Terminator after all. What I owned might be the chance to enjoy being chased by crazy cyborgs then being saved by a father-like T-800. It was timeless to me because it was cemented in my childhood memory. 30 years later, when some teenagers buy it in some ultra-definition format, they may not be entirely impressed by the SFX, but they'd be very impressed by their grandfathers' definition of a 'father figure', or someone with impenetrable chest and belly muscles, a willingness of iron to protect his family, and an unconditional oath of alloy to stick with you.In this sense, Terminator movies are not only mindless Science fictions, but also a crazy prophecy about our status quo. The prophecy states that we as mankind already failed decades before our destined nuclear holocaust, because in our hands something superior was born. The terminator as the movie portrays, have all the desirable male qualities: versatile, strong, disciplined, and favorably indestructible, blah blah blah. This also reflects how the modern society, how the 'here and now' philosophy teaches us about man. We are put into jobs to provide accuracy, efficiency in our performances. We are put into families to be an effective money-making machine. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against Capitalism. Ever since my primary school, my arts teacher used to call me 'examination machine' because he was angry to see my excellence in doing examinations but dull mind in painting. But for some reason, I believed man stands for something unique, something to do with the greater good, something only man can stands for. It seems John Connor's puberty was also a lost journey to find out about man.The savior in the movie John Connor never met his birth-father, he was raised up by a overburdened, apocalyptic-fanatic mother who's given him everything except a father. Though the later stories about him were all about an ongoing struggle as a savior he may never come to be, Terminator 2's story might just be the most important part of John's life. What he lacked in flesh, the terminator made him up in machine, a perfect substitute of father. Even better, in Sarah Connor his mother's eyes, this 'father' is better than any father he can have because 'he will stick with John in any circumstances'. Sadly, with his magic 'neurological CPU' and 'progressive learning', the terminator finally learned about human's feelings and love, and in his noble action to self-destruct, he completed his dedication to greater good, thus completed his way of martyr.I don't know about you guys, but I don't have 'Neurological CPU' and 'progressive learning function'. That being said, my logic would never catch up with the Terminator's logic, so I can't find the answer about the greater good by calculating. Guess as a dumb student who was a 'examination machine', I can only believe such a thing as 'greater good' existed. Unlike Mr. Connor who found out about the greater good on a terminator, I find it on Jesus Christ. Also unlike many people's presumption, Christianity had very similar notions with the terminator story. The one that stood out was man's failure to carry on the greater good. The Bible told us mankind has failed their relationship with the Lord God, therefore even this species is going on to exist on the surface of the earth, every one of them can't escape the final destination of death. In other words, they failed before their actual 'judgment day' just like in the Terminator movies. The difference between the point of the Bible and Terminator movie is just the question why humans failed. If you are particularly curious, please find yourself a copy of Bible to read deeper about it.John Connor in his 20s, need the harassment of terminators in all genders and all models to remind him of the urgency of apocalypse. Without crazy machines tailing us, what do we need to remind us such urgency? Are natural disasters enough? How about pollutions? Along with our own personal pains, health issues, emotional traumas, political insecurities, these pains of human can very well be our gift from the one who created us, 'a flag of truth in the fortress of sins' as a great man once said. It's a time to reflex.",10,4,5,19 June 2010
Salt," Salt: Let's pretend.
","Let's play an interesting game. First, let's pretend we are Americans, and now we need a politically right evaluation on Evelyn Salt. Hands down our final evaluation showed that she's highly emotional, sensitive therefore even she's a female Jason Bourne minus the amnesia, she still stands for the basic ingredients of humanity, that all she did in the entire movie was for her husband, which provided the very soul of the Salt character. Without this love for her husband, Salt wouldn't have gone rogue on her Russian superiors. Therefore, the American values again prevailed, saved itself from within, that everyone deserve to preserve human loves. This is something that would never become a part of the calculation of Russian red baddies.Let's pretend again, that we are Russian red baddies. Now we need a politically right evaluation on Evelyn Salt, or comrade Chenkov. Name: Agent Chenkov, alias Evelyn Salt. Identity: Russian super spy(or Super Russian Spy). Status: Defected. Reason of defection: decades of corruption from evil Western Capitalism and so-called humanism. Although our top cognitive trainer and personality-modification specialist had brainwashed her 100 times during her childhood, we can still only control the time of her activation. Our opponents, the top USA brain-washing specialists had inserted a fail-safe program into her, a husband. Therefore, whenever we activate her, the evil USA had ensured she 100% goes rogue upon activation because of the death of husband. Evaluation Conclusion: more authenticated brainwash mechanism needed. Ho ho ho! Had fun reading my evaluations? So did I. Now comes a more interesting question for die-hard secularists:which evaluation do you like to believe? That's because, if we choose to believe the Russian's, just like a lot of post-modernists believed that humans, on earth, are only puppets of ideological projections and biochemical reactions, we would have to accept the logical conclusion that Russian baddies are just quantitatively inferior to USA, and someday they are gonna come up with this more authenticated brainwash mechanism which no Americans can hide from. That comes to my point, that my USA side of evaluation, though pervasive in illustration, provided some truth on some level.In Timothy Keller's 'The Reason For God', the author had come up with this intriguing argument as a response to the staggering individualism that 'is there anyone in the world right now doing things you believe they should stop doing no matter what they personally believe about the correctness of their behavior?' All those, who until the last minute, believed everyone has the right to decide what's right and wrong for himself/herself, has to say, 'yes'. In return, Mr. Keller would ask them to reflect on if there's some common moral reality that is there not decided by any individuals but by the divine holiness. In my opinion, Salt is a very similar case in which the secularists, post-modernists, liberals can have a good opportunity to think about the very basis for their paradigms. After all, there are too many assumptions for the whistle-blowers to push things in the right direction. That they essentially believe in the American values is just one of these assumptions.Maybe we can pretend again, that we are actually Russian goodies. Then the evaluation conclusion would be: we admit we have made mistakes, terrible mistakes that stretched human natures too far in violence, cold-bloodiness, etc. Maybe humans have ultimate good ways to follow, ways that are more important than defeating another nation. Maybe even someone as robotic as Salt can still be returned to who she's supposed to be, in God's eyes.",8,0,2,9 August 2010
Ratatouille," Life-changing Ratatouille.
","The truth about reviewing your favorite movie is it's never easy. After all these years, Ratatouille happened to be my favorite USA-made cartoon. Or, should I say it's destined to be? OK, let's be fair first. Ratatouille is not a movie you'd like to go into with your rat-hating grandma, especially when you still want to save some goodwill for her.But again, this is a movie I need to recommend to everyone except those who never had any struggles in lives. What precedes the technical terms, atheistic values is its natural reflection on many aspects of my real-life experiences. OK, I am in my mid-20s, having finished university but not in the line of work I love, just like Remy. However, I was also extraordinary like Gusteau, and just like him I wasn't approved by everyone and had a difficult time struggling with it(luckily for me it wasn't a heart attack). Still, I like to review movies which also sums Anton Ego's profession, though unlike me he likes to make harsh comments every time. I don't know how many of you IMDb guys are just like me out there on earth, but it's surely unlikely that you can relate to all the main characters in a movie. Oh, I still forgot to tell you, that the movie is about making delicious cuisines, which is a hobby I have developed after watching Ratatouille.Yeah, and that's how Ratatouille made to my No.1 animated movie of all time. It's so personally inspiring, yet it balanced individualism and collectivism in its brilliant plot. According to Brad Bird the writer/director, this movie is what he wanted to make for a long time but had to drop it because it may be considered too offensive. My experience showed that there could be some kind of sexual preference/bias to this film, that all the male audiences I know loved it instantly including my 55-year-old father but half the female audiences felt reluctant to finish watching it. My mum had to do some serious thinking to appreciate its value after the first viewing which she bite her fingernails through. That being said, Ratatouille does have some crude humors and implications if not interpreted right would offend certain group of people. But, isn't that exactly like the modern globalizing world we're living in? Values, ideologies, customs all struggle to find their places in a newly shuffled world. Young people are often caught up in the middle; some of them carry a talent so dangerous yet so fascinating, like Remy. Some of them only want to stay out of trouble, like Linguni. The way they have to survive together combining a mouse's wizardry and a human's appearance is instantly pervasive, bizarre and unrealistic, yet in my opinion it's a very realistic metaphor to the unfair, hypocritical and above all imperfect human realities.The movie is very dark at times, especially when Remy was led by his father to visit the mousetrap vendor machine. Meanwhile, it's very poignant and tear-jerking especially in the end. Backed up by his entire family of rats, Remy made a dish most unexpected by the egotistic food critic Anton Ego. With the very first bite, Ego's pen dropped on the floor, his eyes widened and entire person freeze in awe. The camera moved into Ego's eye as he brought up the early memory in which mom cooked him the same dish--Ratatouille for him after he injured himself riding a child's bicycle. As he jumped back to reality, he didn't bother to pick up the pen, and finished the dish all the way up like a child. The long lost joy revived on his wrinkled face. Ego asked for the cook to express his deep appreciation, but Linguni refused his praises. Colette and Liguini then told Ego he had to wait for all the guests to leave for seeing the real cook. Ego waited until Liguini presented him Remy in a cook's hat. After Remy showed him all the hard evidences of cooking his favorite dish, Ego left Gusteau's restaurant to write his dish review. Overvoiced by Ego reading his review, Remy stood in the back-alley of the restaurant, gazing at the happy Liguini couple who called him to join them on the way home. He waved them off, and turned to find his father calling him to join the rats family's way home. Loving Linguni and family at the same time, Remy waved his father off, and stood in the middle of the street savoring the triumph as well as enjoying the independence. 'This is a long night to remember', thought him to himself in a special bitter-sweetness. Little did he know, this bitter-sweetness is also shared by his father, who finally learned to accept his son's difference, as he sleeps in the moonlight. In his review, Ego reflected on his harshness and tendency to entertain the world rather than giving them true talent and truly delicious food. He told the public that the chief cook of Gusteau restaurant is unbelievably low-born but is the best cook in Paris. In his self-reflecting review, Ego redeemed himself. In the next day, Gusteau Restaurant was closed down for hygiene problems, and Ego lost his job as the high-profile food critic because he gave Gusteau positive comments. He then invested in a small restaurant which in no time attracted thousands of guests. Then the movie ended with Remy, Linguni and Gusteau being partners and closed friends.have I ever had, or will I ever have another touching moment like what I just described to you in a movie? I hope I will. The notion of adventuring with your own unique taste in Ratatouille directly resulted in me becoming a amateur cook, who enjoyed friends' expressions as they bite my works like tigers. 'You should open your own restaurant.' They sometimes tell me so. 'No', I replied, 'I don't want the bureaus finding a rat in my hat, besides, I'd rather cook for family.'",10,0,1,9 June 2010
Quantum of Solace," Don't bother if you think you got a Bourne Ultimatum rip-off.
","Saw it in Bangkok tonight.What's the point with a Bond movie? After all these good 40 years, does it not deserve some change at least? I guess the critics over this film will go ultimately two-ways. At the good end, people like me will say it's pretty good stand on its own, with smart editing and enough actions. But people who enjoy the old-school Bond movies more will find QOS intimidating, as if it's a rip-off of Bourne franchise.I've quite decided to give the movie a solid 8/10 after 10 minutes into the movie, and the rest of it just kept me interested. So why not? The leading female Olga Kurylenko did a good job as Bond girl, who for the first time doesn't have any romance with Bond. I give credits to that. Plus, Daniel Craig looks cold and strong as usual, with all the stunts well carried out. I also give points to that.I mean, come on. Mark Forster at least knows how to make an action movie. He knows to cut actions into dramatic presentation paralleled. He gives a respect to Godfather and other good movies. So what makes the critics so harsh? What really could have destroyed the film, is the fact that after Casino Royal, people's expectation are so much higher. All you need to do to enjoy Quantam of Solace is to relax and take it for what it is. It's not hard to do.",8,3,6,6 November 2008
District 9," Highly conceptual but also very derivative. The phenomenal narrative style compensated it all.
","Highly conceptual but also very derivative. The phenomenal narrative style compensated it all.District 9 must be one of the most innovative movie of the year, but I'd say it looked very familiar to those who had ever played a Half-life game or Doom game. The story is actually based on Frantz Kafka's La metamorfosis the novel, in which a depressed blue collar woke up to find himself transformed into a huge bug one morning, and eventually alienated by all his families and died in desperate. District 9 fetched the character of Gregorio Samsa the main protagonist from La metamorfosis and one can easily relate the character in this movie to the novel. The whole feeling, the anti-corporation theme and the apocalyptic atmosphere are all admirable in the movie. Yet this movie was shot in South Africa the place for racial issues, adding more dramatic dynamics to the storyline. In the beginning of the movie, several social workers and related personals were interviewed like a real documentary, and everyone commented on the event in his/her view. One can also easily forget that this is a sci-fi movie and consider them commenting on real racial problems. All of these are very impressive and made the first act of the movie. And later...Bang! District 9 changed its subtitle from La metamorfosis to Half-life. The infected main protagonist was considered most valuable yet most dangerous by the evil capitalists. He finally broke away from capture and took the aliens side. With alien genes, he was able to handle alien weapons from Rail Gun, BFG, Lightening Gun from Doom(Quake) to Gravity Gun and energy pulse rifle from Half-life. Most fantastically he played Iron Man for 10 minutes in the climax and blew a lot of humans into jam and juice.Well, this is a movie one can go to purely for its visual effects. Given its $30 million budget, it's really very impressive and more effective than Cloverfield. The shaky camera and the relatively realistic visual presentation will grab your eyeballs for 100 minutes, and make you impulsive to tell others to see it now! However, if you reflect on it you'd probably find a lot problems like underdeveloped technical details and insufficient explanations on both the alien side and human side. Maybe that will leave more space to its sequel, hopefully. The alien weaponry were all created as a homage to popular video games and lack a totally fresh feeling. But we can live with that. You won't want to see it on DVD. Ratherly, you would want to see it in full HD.Anyway it's still a great movie and a good reason to go to cinema. 8/10.",8,2,5,12 September 2009
2012," Video game sequences plus lame climax.
","Well, when it comes to director Roland Emmerich, his works Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow are both respectable movies with a genius touch. But for 2012, I don't know......If you are awed by the special effects in the trailer, well, you will be allowed to see the full version of those spectacular scenes with 'the whole world turns into sh*t', but be warned that you already got the cream of the movie from the trailer. So very sadly this is another spectacle that was topped by its trailer.And please be warned that these sequences are not so thrilling simply because they are like 'on-rail' sequences in a action game, that the main protagonist's vehicles are indestructible and always tend to go through some narrow places that lead the ladies on board to scream. But if you never see these in a movie before, it's worth a watch.On the humanity side, this movie is simply inferior to The Day After Tomorrow, and the story a little bit took itself too seriously that even Independence Day had some rich developments compared to it. Never mind......Though, after seeing all those holocaust in a movie, you'd thank God we're still alive and not insane, does it mean the movie is effective in some way? 6.5/10 C+ for visual effects.",6,1,7,12 November 2009
I Am Legend," A great horrifying and depressing journey of a man's faith in his kind
","Firstly I'd like to mention the trailer of I Am Legend, as it could be the best trailer of the year for following reasons: 1, intriguing and attractive;2, potential theme and expandable action sequences; 3, a misleading effect as if the movie is more about surviving than horror!! And that's a flaw. The movie's horror element is so overdone that 1, the audiences are always depressed and expecting to be tortured by more escalating darkness.2,whenever Will Smith express his feeling by screaming, it looks like a parody because the audiences can finally breath for a moment and some of us even laugh at him in relaxation. The movie should never be rated PG-13.Well, that's enough for complains. I Am Legend is very innovative in its visual style that all the details in the scenes implies Apocalypse. It has obviously more CGI than Children of Men and overall it's well done, for both the ruins of New York and Zombies(or human-shaped monsters, etc.). Honestly I never expect some CG zombie to be so scary. Will Smith did a good job, he successfully delivers a man twisted by fate and by loneliness. He is the core of the whole movie. Therefore the movie is a journey about the his role. He used to be a person of family, but after the disaster he became godless, holding a belief of both right and wrong ideas about his kind. Insisting to treat the zombies by his blood for 3 years, he found out this belief is too far to reach and too valuable to abandon. Therefore the movie intentionally showed his suffering in long shots, which is a torture to both Will and the audiences until the female survivor appeared. Her arrival, also has multiple effects on Will's character. On the good side restores his faith in searching for others, on the other hand spoils his 'Ground Zero'--attempts to cure zombies. After a final battle, Will got a chance to redeemed his faith......Well, if you think you can think about such themes after the 1st viewing, I recommend this one to you. However if you are:1, heart-conditioned;2, under 18; 3, easily depressed; 4, afraid of darkness I strongly suggest you don't see it.",8,4,10,13 December 2007
Kick-Ass," A thoughtful exploration on superhero phenomenons.
","Despite the fact that the movie borrows heavily from titles like Kill Bill, Little Miss Sunshine and other black comedies, it's still a masterpiece on its own. The fact is, no other titles had been so frank, at least not in recent time.I didn't read the comic book of Kick-Ass, but judging by the quality and story structure of Wanted, I'd say Kick-Ass got the similar spirit of being offensive and downright entertaining at the same time. Note that offensive means not afraid of being dirty. The opening sequences totally told that having Dave quoting 'my only superpower is being invisible to girls'. Later scenes just has the dynamic to surpass your imagination time and time again. Yes, I am entertained.Below the vulgar surface of the presentation, Kick-Ass is actually more socially concerned than you think(no pun intended). From the beginning, the nature of so-said 'superhero' is put to examination from all aspects. In some eyes, a superhero is only a wacko in a horrible suit, incapable of growing up. To some, superheroes are basic ingredients of a sustainable life, and note that this applies to both poor and rich kids(or pedestrian kids and gangster kids). To the coolly-dressed-guy who-leaped-off-a-skyscraper-and-crashed-into-a-car, superhero is a leased ID to do something stunning. To the people with vendetta against certain others, superhero is also an acceptable way to sugarcoat vengeance, meaning man-slaughtering. All these facts would round up a commonly-known fact, that superheroes don't exist in real world. Yet, the story didn't end here, because the superhero phenomenon is real anyway. And then we have the 2nd and 3rd act dwelling on this.Kick-Ass the hero has become widely loved by Americans in the movie, basically because he did something that barely successful but nonetheless heroic. Only for that certain second, Kick-Ass the hero existed. But, his status quo had to be inflated to the level of an idol, a superhero anyway. That's just indifferent from true figures like Ghandi, Teresa the nun, etc. They are not so super in any way, yet the public continues to search for a perfect hero that they can idolize. For Americans, for better or worse, they are tangled with superheroes. Only death can separate them from superheroes, I guess. The Kick-Ass film is smart that it's aware of this fact and satirize on the right notes.Though, the performances are very remarkable. This may very well be Nicolas Cage's best role in years, and Chloe Moretz who played Hit-girl is also very impressive. Their characters in the movie are downright vigilantes who mirror Dave's superhero dream, yet they are also the most emotional and lovable characters. Mark Strong continues to play funny villains and he's getting better and better.To those who hate satires, I'd say the bottom-line of Kick-Ass is a well-polished 20-million-dollar-budget 'superhero' movie which delivers equal fun and brilliance.9/10. Waiting for the verdict from Oscars.",9,6,15,17 May 2010
Unknown," Why did I figured out the plot of the movie at the very beginning......
","You know, if you are a big fan of espionage thrillers, don't watch this movie. That's because you will get the entire story figured out about 5 minutes into it.I watched this film for the sake of Liam Nesson, who was ever impressive as tough guys with a tough voice. This is especially true in movies like Taken. When I first had my eyes on Unknown's poster, I had the feeling of Dejavu. But, since everything resembles Taken, that's not entirely a bad thing, right? Then I went into it expecting some bad-ass actions and a solid story. At the Berlin airport, when Liam Nesson's 'wife' mockingly said the line 'giving the speech, seriously?' I got the whole plot worked out. It's kinda sad to see how much your mindset is as clich√©d as Hollywood wants you to be.Then the entire movie played out as I expected. It almost seemed like the writer jumped out near the end saying, 'aha! You must haven't figured out some minor twists even if you worked out the main twist.' And I said like, 'That's exactly the kind of little twists I was expecting, and do you have any more tricks up your sleeve?' Man, Liam Nesson in Taken was so cool, but in this one he's just like a little girl imitating Jason Bourne. If they could only smooth up some ridiculous romance and unconvincing character development, the movie would be more watchable. It must be a luxury compared to the budget of the film......Although, Unknown was so devastatingly clich√©d that it might inspire so many great parodies. Wait for those genius on the web to do so.5/10.",5,1,3,5 June 2011
Gran Torino," This movie puts a lot of families to shame.
","Usually I know Clint Eastwood only for the roles like Dirty Harry or 'blonde' in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. His most recent performances, starting with Unforgiven, along with Million Dollar Baby gave audiences a feeling of over-seasoning with old-age. As the audiences becoming old, they also got more and more involved in the characters played by Eastwood. In Gran Torino he perfects this tone of performance and delivered an Oscar-worthy performance. Just the last 20 minutes are worthy the Academy Award, in my opinion.Well, I think this film is made on behalf of all the elder people, but made for their children to watch. The whole movie is seemingly race-biased but ultimately has an undertone of putting a lot of white families to shame. In China we have a saying that 'a distant relative is less reachable than a good neighbor.' which describes the situation in this movie. Walt's family is estranged and can't really relate themselves to him, while the Hmong family has a lot of respect for elders(witnessed by Walt). Despite all the discrimination of Walt on Hmong's life style, he found them easier to get along with and warmer to make friends with. Mr. Eastwood definitely has a negative comment on the American society in this movie, delivered by the grandchildren of Walt's.The end is the punch of the movie, it hit your stomach and make you think a lot about what's worth in a life. To prevent me from spoiling the movie, I will also not reveal any further story in the movie. But if you want to watch a movie made with a heart, this is one.",9,4,10,27 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," A different and fresh take on American dream.
","Thanks to Law Abiding Citizen, which has nothing to do with this movie except one line 'someone has to do some pretty nasty things so we can live in our American dream', I came to understand what's the movie is about. Of course, it's not the greatest war movie ever made, and it's definitely not your heroic take on wars. I mean, even movies like Saving Private Ryan and Flag of Our Fathers nailed the icons of heroes into characters' heads when the main objective is to cleanse the dirty war of its dirty heroism. But The Hurt Locker, man, is almost 100% anti-hero.Everyone who's a role model in this movie has been blown up, from Guy Pearce's character to the Christian Camargo's Col. John Cambridge. The one who survived and screwed around them like a ghost and a jerk was our protagonist, SFC William James. Don't make me wrong, he's a good guy. He started out successful in every mission to get rid of bombs and OEDs, and he's a good shot and strategist too. But, he's also a regular trespasser, a nut-case who does sports in war to win a 'reckless' from fellow soldiers, and a failed father figure to his family or any families. There was a very compelling thread in the middle of the movie where James pulled out a personal investigate into the little boy's murder. And it's like a turning point which lead the whole Iraq war into James' personal story. Every time he tried to make a good pursuit in the middle of combat, he messed up the whole thing into a bloody irony. Every friend he made was claimed by death or hatred, or both. When colleagues called him a madman and hostiles considered him a monster, there's really very little human left in him except the adrenaline rush war brought.So, what's so different about this movie, is it not another Platoon mixed with post-modern concepts like 'Gulf syndrome'? No. Like I said, it's a very personal take on a war that's still going on. Clyde Shelton in Law Abiding Citizen is a good mirror to William James because they had everything in common except the former's family were slaughtered while the later's were disconnected. And as common sense tells, the later happens all the time, which gives The Hurt Locker a realistic edge that no recent similar productions can match. You see, American dream doesn't always die in the hands of thugs, breaking into a thousand pieces in tragic slow motion. That's just a stereotype people adopted in their minds from Hollywood. American dreams can walk away on its on feet, echoing in the hollowness of modern lifestyle(if you consider war and war games a lifestyle), making you wonder what the heck had happened. For the record, William James really should be given the honor of a war hero because he saved hundreds of lives by disabling OEDs. But the real hero in him had long been killed, the body disposed in nowhere. He's definitely one of the deepest roles in movies. And if the real figure who provided the character basis for him is still fighting on the front-line, I'd pray for his return safe, sound and redeemed, amen.",9,30,46,24 January 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Warning: this is not a fan-boy's review.
","Have to say, New Moon the most anticipated romance tale of the year, is decently made. So allow me, a non-fan of the series to make this comment.First off, I know people hated it for what it is. The whole idea is like a coming-of-age story of several abnormal kids. I know it's a homage to Shakespeare; and I definitely noticed the similarity with Underworld series it began to show. But I also have to say that sometimes people hate it because they assume it's stupid, and despised the puppy love illustrated in such a fantasy scenario. But, it's the film-making that grabbed my attention.Throughout, New Moon demonstrates with superb pacing, sophisticated art design that overflowing with the whole story, and smooth special visual effects that well fit in. For a standard Hollywood production it should be like this, but allow me to say it adds points to the whole experience. It's not a movie you'd expect an awful lot of actions in it, but believe me you will see plenty of compelling actions that keep you entertained if not delighted. Some scenes are like TV-commercials, but allow me to say they are a lot more beautiful and more genuine than those outrageous built-in advertisements in '2012' or so.The other aspect I'd like to give a nod, is the professional attitude of the whole production. The story is about a bunch of teenagers, but the movie never fell amateurish or video-game-like. The actors all fit into their roles naturally, and again allow me to say there was not anything in performances amateurish or in-genuine enough to distract me from the story. Of course the movie is not Oscar-level, but it successfully captured the youngsters' ignorance, arrogance and all kinds of struggles between immaturity and responsibility. Shouldn't we be a bit more open to teenagers? I am not saying this movie is perfect in doing politics right, but it's not bad for a family ride that can make chances for some family talk.So, 7/10 is a fair score given the movie is not Oscar stuff, but admit it that so many people just gave it a 1 even before they see it.",7,57,122,19 November 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A different movie from Fincher.
","This is indeed, a very different screen experience, as many of us had been through a big popcorn year. Actually, this film deserved positive reviews. That's how good it is. First class director, first-class actors plus the beautiful cinematographic and music. Some movies are meant to be appreciated, and this is indeed one of those few.I'd like to share some thoughts I got from watching the film. For example, later stages of life can be hard, either being an old man or a baby, and it's always lucky to have someone with love around you. I don't watch this film to persuade people into its logic and fantasy. I hope that one can simply appreciate life more after watching this, just like me. Some other thoughts also came to my mind after watching it, that some beauty can't be derived from life, but can only be buried with love. That might be why Benjamin escaped his own parental responsibility. He just knew he'd have to die in a way nobody could take. He didn't even reach for Daisy's help when he's becoming incapable. There are more inspirations from a single viewing of the film. I can't imagine what I can get with more viewings.Talking about performance. I think Cate Blanchett just delivered again. Her change through the whole movie was so nature, comparing to Brad Bitt. She just didn't waste any single second on the screen. Seeing her dancing as well as seeing her cry at Benjamin were totally satisfying. On the other side, Brad Bitt's performance was more alike a statue, an eye candy for the audiences. This is not saying that Brad didn't deliver, but he was constantly covered by Blanchett.David Fincher had been directing dark films all these years, many of which being my favorite. He apparently took a big step into the poetic filming, rather than making darker films. This might be a good sign for all of us. In the film, we saw human forgiving another human, a person reading another person's life, and so much more...9/10 It's straight-forwardly heartbreaking towards the end, but still a masterpiece.",9,0,2,10 January 2009
World Trade Center," Taken into account that this is basically real memory of two participants, it is GREAT.
","For nearly a year the movie has kept its rating on IMDb of nearly 7.1, but it later dropped to 6.4, which in my opinion makes little sense. Is it Academy Award stuff? No. Is it a real-time documentary? Not exactly. It is, in my opinion, the life-and-death diary of two police officers on the probably darkest day of their lives. It is more than a documentary.The story went into its plot quite realistically, without much dramatic presentations and playing. From the angle of those brave officers, we see shining souls, and gladly we can see it for what it is, not some Hollywood stereotype stuff. People may find out the truth by viewing the movie that, Nicolas Cage's team hardly saved a person from the towers before they were trapped under the ruins. So, you may ask, what's the point of all these sacrifice? The director was smart enough not to force any ideas about this problem into audiences' mind, he'd rather tell you the true experiences, not only the desire to survive but also fear, rage, love and memory. Their actions didn't save any one out of the WTC, but they deserve the search of people. They didn't win back the buildings, but they won giving their families, their friends and all the US people hope. It took maybe 1000 people to work on the ruins above them to save 2 people, were the 1000 people worth? They gave their answer by cheering on the survivors.This is a great story for people who need faith in love and God. And I think everyone just need these two, so I recommend this movie to EVERYONE.",8,1,3,11 April 2008
The Dark Knight," Even darker than Batman Begins, though the Joker didn't die.
","Christopher Nolan's approach for Batman again worked. Judging by my observation in a Bangkok cinema on July 17, it will drain at least 150,000,000 both in US and worldwide. This is one of the main movies, if not THE main movie, of the year. But it's not your typical commercial comic hero for many reasons.1, Back in 2005, Batman begins was criticized to be too dark, as a Batman movie. If you still give points to those comments, you will definitely find the Dark Knight even darker, maybe as twice dark as Begins. In the movie, there are virtually no sex, no explicit gore and even no swearing. But there are two main traditional villains, both twisted and horrifying as much as any A-Class horror movie villain. There are main characters died in most miserable circumstances, which made the audiences depressed. There is also a darker conclusion for Batman's fate, and none of the above was presented in a moderate way. 2, Come along the dark messages, is our dear Joker. We know the Joker didn't die; Heath Ledger died instead. There is still a rumor around saying that, it's the Joker, who dragged Ledger into a world of madness and didn't release him from the character, killed Ledger. The rumor can't be justified, but the Joker does jump out of the screen. He threatens everyone on and off the screen in a unusual manner, giving you a chill which makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like a Disney joker. This is a very daring performance indeed, but dangerous, for the parents may find their children approve the Joker for his logic and his value which work better in the 'real world'. It seems this Batman movie doesn't belong to Batman, but to the Joker, who essentially pushed the whole story forward and destroyed more than just human lives, but also their beliefs in Batman. 3, Batman doesn't own this movie. He is merely a narrator, a firefighter who desperately saves human lives from evil, while witnessing tragedies happening around. Once he want to be proactive, he drags himself into more trouble. Consequently, friends have gone one by another.If we see any development on Batman's character, that should be his loneliness.So, audiences may find Dark Knight a bit more difficult to swallow than Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Hellboy 2 and Hancock. Among all the blockbusters so far, it assumes more thinking and higher IQ from the audiences... Honestly speaking, I can't recommend this to everyone, especially NOT to children.I will recommend it to those who: 1, require a smart script and intelligent quotes. 2, willing to see creative action sequences and less CGIs. 3, not allergic to extreme violence and anarchism. 4, accept the realistic(sometimes pessimistic) messages from a superhero movie. 5, at least 20 years old.Feel free to listen to some lighthearted musics after you see Dark Knight, if you need something to get rid of the mood.9/10 Almost excellent.",10,6,15,17 July 2008
Taken," This movie made me hate French, but it's made by French.
","Just wondering how the movie will affect the travelers who planned a vacation to French. If Paris is really that corrupted, I'd say thanks to the production team for warning me from traveling to Paris. LOL! Well, apart from being an excellent action thriller, Taken is a serious movie took the topic of Kidnapping-prostitution business in one of the most civilized country,Frence. The makers definitely took the position of a international prosecutor who punishes everyone in this industry. The story is about an ex-CIA agent(Liam Neeson) who was estranged from his family and got divorced years ago. Had to allow his 17-year-old daughter to travel around Europe with no guardians, he eventually found his daughter kidnapped by an international prostitution organization. Traced the steps of his daughter, he had to risk everything he had, and probably everything French people had, to save her. This is not a new kind of story. What amuses me is the undertone of the movie, which is loudly blow-ed-out self-righteousness and revenge against the corruption of a nation. Yes, that's right, a NATION. Every class and everyone is involved in the crimes committed in this movie. From the slum small-times to the ones behind the desk, from illegal immigrants to the billionaires, the movie is an outrageous accuse to the ignorant system of Paris. With such social commentary, Taken is suddenly differentiated from its homogeneous movies. Maybe that's also why it's rated 8.0/10 on IMDb.My rating:9/10 Recommend to: everyone who thinks he's a good person.",9,1,4,7 February 2009
Avatar," Dances with Na'vis, plus $211million, minus the depth.
","If anyone tells you before seeing Avatar that they were expecting a well written epic, would you think he's retarded? Probably. Our little planet waits for this sci-fi spectacle for one reason--spectacular visual effects in 3D.I just saw it in 3D in a Bangkok cinema, and I got what I had expected before. So, it's worth the price for anyone paid to see it(As you can see I gave it an 8/10). The phenomenon created by the actual viewing is almost beyond the words. Walking onto Pandora, both the audiences and Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) were awed by a very believable alien world. This is no 'Final Fantasy', and this is definitely not a Pixar movie, it's James Cameron's visual ambition realized with 230 million dollars. As we see the complete alien ecosystem on Pandora, the lively details of every character and creature on the screen, one can't help being dragged into the world created by Cameron's team. Many scenes felt so heartfelt and thoughtful that you almost want to be a naturalist yourself. But, one can also start to build up another dimension of expectation as the incredible first act is enough to promote a well-developed mythology.You might be asking why did I wrote such a negative title. Yes, you got the idea. After my expectation was inflated, the 2nd and last act only led to one dimension of story, which was already well told in $19million-budgeted Dances with Wolves. This isn't really bad, but a minor disappointment because this outrageous similarity can take the audiences back to their reasons and minds. While watching the 2nd act which involves some tragic situations, I couldn't help but noticing the Na'vis were actually native Americans in blue skins. The 3rd act only made me notice the lack of depth in the 'civilization clash' theme.Still, this is not saying Avatar is not a good movie. On the contrast, this review means to help you stocking less on the story side and totally immerse into the movie's visuals and logics. Concerning logics, I am already decided not to call Avatar a Sci-fi because it's more alike Star Wars. But be warned this is not Star Wars because the scale of the movie ate everything else, including performances. Though, Stephen Lang's Colonel Miles was a strong candidate for this generation's Darth Vader. Enjoy being a Na'vi!",8,80,153,17 December 2009
Up," 'There is no value without sentimental value.' And that's the Pixar value.
","Saw it in Bangkok in 3D, found it overwhelmingly touching for a cartoon. If the movie can keep you concentrate on its sentimental side for the whole 2-hours ride, it surely can make you think it's the best animated film ever made(as currently at Top 18 of IMDb Top 250). The film doesn't falls short in technical aspects. The characters, objects and everything are animated in a way that they're not bound by the physics rules. The scenes are not so different from a combination of The Incredibles and Cars, but they are assembled professionally and made their own credibility. You can prematurely conclude that a movie casting an old fart as the main character may not be vividly colorful, but that definitely is wrong. You will find the color of good old days' memory, color of freshness and color of life in Up, and you don't have to try to get it.The story, basically the same formula implemented by Pixar, has indeed succeed again. After Wall-E and Up, we can safely say that, there are not any common senses that Pixar dare not break. So don't argue about how many balloons can bringing up a house, or how was the house floating so steady without proper operation, or how did another old fart get the technology of a dog voice box after locking himself in mountains half a century. Just sit and take it for what it is and enjoy. Family ingredient is the true star of Up, which took me to tears twice in the first 20 minutes. If ever you get a stubborn but loving family member, you will cry too. And after all, it's the sentimental value that saved its climax and ending from being a run-of-the-mill fun.However, there is always a however. Since Pixar made Wall-E, Up will not escape from being compared to Wall-E. The screenplay of Wall-E totally blew me away from beginning to the end, but Up's energy is halfway leaking like the balloons on the house. The fist act, so touchingly executed, totally promised too much for the rest of Up to bear. After Charles became a menace, the movie became predictable at all. You can tell the bird tried to escape but failed, the old man has to struggle between his house(a symbol of all the sentimental value summed up) and the righteousness(saving the bird), you can also tell what choice he's gonna make and how he's gonna overcome his own issue. It's also obviously rigid that the writer tried to combine old Carl's emotion breaking through and the rescue mission. At last, it's sad for me to find it predictable because it's like suddenly waking up from a beautiful, touching dream.But, this doesn't prevent the whole cinema from laughing through the movie and appreciate the efforts makers put in it. This is still, a great film in every aspect.You definitely need to bring your family to it. The children will learn, the elders will sigh and sob, and all of them will enjoy. Sometimes it has a darker and heavier undertone than Wall-E, but the final result is still as up-beating as a balloon.8.5/10 A fierce competitor in Oscar, but may be beaten this time.",8,1,2,14 June 2009
From Hell," Romantic Detective VS. Conspiracy Cult?
","From Hell is one of the more famous movie about Jack the Ripper, the series murderer who gutted several prostitutes in London, and left disturbing messages. The reason that his story is highly fascinating, is because this is an unsolved case, and until today, Jack the Ripper is still at large, if you can say so.The movie boasted technical achievements on several levels. The extremely gritty and bleak portrait of London slums is more than an eye candy, if you can say so. That is to say the art decoration of From Hell is literally from baroque era and Balzac. Compared to more recent productions like Sweeny Todd, who also aimed the camera on the slums and dirty gritty side of British glory, From Hell is really more disturbing and depressing to watch because of the social scope and context it examined.It's horrifying because it has a more realistic tone and accuracy on certain levels. When you see the prostitutes being constricted by a rope in a row in a church sleeping, while waiting for their nightfall to work and be killed, you really can't help but feel bad.All the special make-up effects just added more edge to its poignancy and trivial features. Coincidentally and ironically, this movie also stars the brilliant Johnny Depp in the leading role. I can only imagine inspector Abberline chasing down Sweeny Todd in a bloodier scenario. Cheers! However, From Hell's view on a series killer at large is also very stereotypical and intentionally romantic. The way they examine each character and each motivation is full of post-modern skepticism except for the leading role played by Depp. Jack the Ripper is not only a high-ranking royal officer, but essentially a leading conspirator in a cult that controlled England for centuries. If only the decisive historical evidence for this theory can be found, the whole world will shake. Every character who has even a bit of connection to the villains group would ended up a co-conspirator or someone with extremely ugly motivations(even the queen didn't escape this). Perceived by inspector Abberline who is the closest thing to a hero in this movie, everything and every attempt to solve the case is pointless, not only because the case would be covered up consequently but also because the result of his efforts will have nothing to do with him. When he died in the opium house at the end, the movie nailed nothing but the desolation of humanism and faith into our mindset, which is already bleak and hopeless enough. So, allow me to call the movie a elongated depiction of destruction of human souls.Modern skepticism about Christianity is often based on people's perception that churches(or the church if you are catholic) is that this religious group is only one of the many 'players' in the society who strive for survival, identity and consensus. Yes, no denying that ever since there was a church, there was a corruption in the church, not to mention later eras only brought more power and corruption to it. We really can't ask a person to prove his/her faith is untouched like virgin Mary, but we may still need to have a more balanced perception and thinking of the reality in order to see the original messages in this faith. From Hell provided us with a 'bigger picture' which is based on many speculations and if considered seriously, insults on certain historic figures. Yet, it holds a 'hero of the humanity' in the core of its story and spirit, giving people more reasons to adore themselves and the heroism they have each day in fighting their bosses or lifting up an elder citizen from snow. It is only a matter of time until people come to realize that the capital From Hell to 'cushion' their morality standpoint is a broken one and leads to deeper darkness.Not to mention those nature-born pessimists. Anyway, giving a movie a more romantic undertone doesn't make it worthy your time and emotion. Thanks for reading.",7,1,1,20 February 2010
Castle in the Sky," As you wish, I would explain about the pirates' affection with Sheeta.
","Casting Sheeta as the main character is definitely what made this movie unique after so many years, since Sheeta is a natural charmer. But since many of the users here are asking about the relationship of Sheeta and the pirates, I'd have to explain my understanding.Firstly, a little girl at age 13 is both a sign of purity/innocence and liveliness, so all the characters, despite gender, age or any other demographic characters, would treat her with courtesy. The only exception is the self-imposed king of castle of sky Muska. He is the materialized human mental as greed and ambition, with the pursuit in civilization and unlimited destruction of nature and human/naturally/manufactured lives. He is, naturally, despised by all the good guys in the movie.Compared to him are the goofy/foul/lovely pirates who had a strong mom who always control them and maintained their simple mental and lives. Even though they are death-wish burglars who defy the law, they didn't commit much of the crimes of species-annihilation and mass-murdering own comrades, which were committed by Muska. So, in some certain senses, pirates were only materialized naughty boys who's physically pushing 40 but mentally only 13-15 years old. The appearance and companion of Sheeta, was not only their enlightenment of puppy love, but also a strong reflection to their mom's undefeated personality. The funny thing is they never even dare challenging Pazu and Sheeta's friendship(lovers' relationship?) and close contacts, they salivate for such a relationship but also realized that Pazu's mentally mature and taking heavy responsibilities, which they can't have....So in some senses, they are mummy's good boys.In Japanese culture, men are too much burdened, with responsibility, honor and all kinds of stuff which finally killed him before his old age(like karachi) or destroyed his personality(making him a alcoholic). Hayao Miyazaki created these fearless and trouble-less pirates to reflect on such social status and promote his own value system for men, which was even developed in later projects, all portraying strong women's influences on men.Castle in the sky is a fairy tale about two kids' fellowship which lasted even longer than their civilization. It's also a subtle fable about the direction of all civilizations. The first 5 minutes of the movie were absolutely tear-jerking, with all sorts of sci-fi sky-ships floating and landing and escorting in an ancient wall-paint style. It's marked with 1980's animation technical limit, but it's still so moving and touching after the 1st viewing. Every time the flying stone shines and Sheeta flies, the whole animation were saturated with a kind of beauty and poetry that is not easily described by words. Not to mention the breathtaking final scenes where the structure of the entire castle in the sky fell apart. If you ever look closely, the bricks fell one by one, no kidding.Sheeta and Pazu were, in my and my parents' opinion, too young to have such a relationship. But on earth, what's the wrong with this relationship? They were only kids, more specifically, orphans. But they were both brave, dedicated and much more responsible than most adults in the story. Their love for each other fixed their immaturity by giving them the absolute basis for fighting for each other. So in this way, Castle in the sky is also one of the best love story ever written.Had to mention the robots in the movie. These robots are not emphasized by their robotic movements, rather, they are portrayed as lives with robot mechanics. So their fates were also cared about by all the kids and adults audiences alike.Castle in the Sky is still underachieved on this site and it will receive more attention and higher rating as time goes by. If you haven't seen it, go purchase it on DVD because it's definitely worth buying.",10,2,3,1 August 2009
The Untouchables," The reason why Public Enemies shouldn't be made.
","Clearly, because this movie existed, Public Enemies should never have been made. With very believable depiction, legendary film-making and performances, The Untouchables gave you the best crime epic about 1930s.One of the best efforts pulled off by the movie, as mentioned, lies within its believability. The depictions of either Ness or Capone could have been totally cartoonish or on the other extreme, being like robots. However, Kevin Costner and Robert De Niro were so good in their characters that Johnny Depp and Christian Bale should have taken notes. Ness was never an 'action hero' or someone really so 'untouchable' in the movie. On the contrast, he is weak, regularly depressed and could fail at all. As the core character of the story, he is legendary not only in his achievement in taking down Capone, but also in his character's development from a dedicated white knight to a somewhat bad-ass crime fighter. Costner's performance totally made Ness more convincing and emotional, charged by Brian De Palma's best casting ever. The movie is convincing also because it's multi-dimensional, that a 20-year-old and a 40-year-old will both enjoy but got different things from it. The storyline flowed so naturally and realistically that as an audience one felt the pain, the fear and the price of fighting crime and criminals. Yes, this is a movie where the heroes can get hurt, killed, but still they pulled off a legendary fight with the most vicious criminal. Unlike Public Enemies' self-indulgent storyline, The Untouchables is a lesson about character study in a streamlined story-telling. The reason Sean Connery deserved his Oscar is also justified here.The visuals, along with other aspects of the movie, are nearly perfected by director De Palma. The gunfights may not be so stylish and kinetic as in recent films like Public Enemies, but definitely had their edge. Essentially, the movie never put too much weight on actions, yet the actions stood out to entertain. Sometimes, old school is good school.If you notice, The Untouchables already had everything that Public Enemies wanted to talk about, and in a better way and shorter time. It's full of mesmerizing camera works and likable characters, yet stayed true to the nature of reality, no doubt it's only getting better and better after all these years.",10,0,0,31 October 2009
Zombieland," horror? Not really. Funny? Definitely.
","Summarized in one sentence, Zombieland is a Dawn of the Dead theme park in Disneyland, if there can be one. Everything in a zombie movie before appear in this movie as a farce, and don't even expect it to be horrifying other than some bloody scenes.The fact that Zombieland is good lies within its correct and precise marketing, that it's for those who love a fun, funny movie which doesn't disappoint. It's solid in technical perspectives, performances(Abigail Breslin is brilliant) and every scene flows with senses of humor. From beginning to the end, it never stops homaging to famous movies and scenes, yet it's not as serious and morally-concerned like Shaun of the Dead. By the way I strongly suggest you don't compare these two movies because they have totally different emphasis.I won't talk about any single scene in the movie to spoil the fun, just expect to laugh a lot in the theater.8/10. Satisfying.",8,2,4,11 November 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Enjoy the fireworks, 'cause if you take it as a film you can't save it from falling apart.
","Well, I am not gonna persuade you out of this, 'cause you'd see it anyway. I'd like to contribute this review to director Mr. Michael Bay, who may or may not have had authority to the final cut. Dear Mr. Bay, if you are reading this, I hope you may finally give us a better revised version. Sincerely.Firstly, let's review some great qualities provided in the first Transformers. 1, organically entertaining script doesn't fall short of intelligence. The whole story flows smooth as a dream, with lots of lighthearted parts. We had time to develop emotions for Bumblebee and appreciate Optimus Prime and his nobility. Yet the movie had a clear and good message. 2, You know it's made-believe but you still can't believe they brought transformers alive in such details. It became our second nature to gaze and gasp in the whole 140 minutes. One time a robot, and that's the eye candy. 3, The movie never felt too lame to appreciate. Mr. Bay managed to put Jon Voight, Shia Laboef and John Turturro in the same shot, yet everyone still could hold true to their roles and make senses. In short, they don't pretend to be dumb. 4, A lot of chasing sequences definitely added dynamics to the movie, yet it's never confusing, meaning you know who's fighting whom.Every action sequence is long, consistent enough to enjoy.Now let's see Revenge of the Fallen. 1, the first act worked. Congratulations.Autobots recruited some new members with goofy personalities, good. They help the world getting rid of decepticons, right.Sam's growing up and begin to have problems,wait. The family gigs still had a touch of its precedent. I had absolutely no problems with cheap jokes, but they feel sometimes long, distracting and overdone. The real problem is the lame undertone of its script. When all the fun on the screen get tired, audiences may wake up to find the 'Sam going to university' story not a good exploration into the 'growing pains' sub-plot.Wait, you are saying there is no such sub-plot? OK, play it your way Mr. Bay. Still, there's better ways to push the story forward to a conclusion that, Sam must rise and shine and save the earth with his punk charm again. I'd like to see Sam got bullied very often and still couldn't walk out of his halo as a big hero, which becomes a big barrier to his maturity. Maybe nowadays kids just can't even appreciate anything bittersweet, not to mention some real LOSS of the protagonist(s). If that's true, I sympathize with you, Mr.Bay.2, 2nd act. Well, a lot of problems.Sam's college assassination is good;Prime's sacrifice is good. We saw some signals of apocalypse when decepticons arrived and Prime got killed. But the camera just can't drop from Sam and his sidekicks,spending too much time in making it a comedy. Since so much has been invested to create robots, why did you use them to slow down the movie instead of speed it up. In short, terrible pace and inconsistent plot development marred this act. After they arrived in Egypt, I was hoping the climax has some salvage value. My suggestion will be: Bumblebee need more time on the screen for the story to make sense, since many things are left for explanation.3, the climax. Well simply the climax itself can make a full-length feature, if edited correctly. There are totally 3 plot lines involving all the robots in creation, but none of them had enough time to awe the audiences. We spent too much time listening to jokes and screams when we wanted to see autobots. The idea that US army defend Prime's remains with autobots is cool, but later we saw everything in a flash and couldn't tell who's fighting whom. If all the good guys and bad guys just get blown up so easily like dolls, who cares about them? In the precedent, Bumblebee tried to defend humans by holding up a truck but got his feet blown. That's something solid, which is needed here. This time it's Sam got blown and died for a few minutes until the spirits of Primes decided he's a good leader. That's OK, but it further dragged the movie into a cheap farce. 'Everyone has to be happy' seems to be the goal of producers. But if those guys always got revived so easily and jump and kick in seconds, they are no longer flesh and bones. My take on this scene is slightly different: Sam got revived by the dust of 'Matrix' but gained a little side effects--synchronizing his mind with the autobot he revives(that's to justify his authority). Therefore he could fight side by side with Prime, making the final battle more intriguing and emotional-involving. Although Prime got reconstructed and empowered, he's still losing in fighting Megatron and the Fallen. Although Sam could barely move after his injury, he acknowledged Prime of the weakness of the Fallen. Those surviving autobots also summed up a little more resistance to help Prime, showing their integrity and solidarity as good guys. After an epic battle, Prime finally defeated the Fallen. Later, Sam's injury needed more time to recover in the hospital, therefore his friends congratulated him for saving the world again and assured him that his growing pain can be overcome with friends and love. The astrology professor came for a visit too after he knows Sam's heroic deeds, and proposed to give him a special section in the hospital as gratitude. However, Sam declined. Later that night, Mikaella asked Sam about the names of the stars(or the fate of the universe), when they are on the balcony of Sam's ward. Mikaella was startled about Sam's profound knowledge in astrology. Sam explained it's Optimus Prime who taught him in their mind connection, and the camera showed Prime on the other side of the earth summoning more autobots. Then the credits rolls.Well, just my idea. 5/10 means F for failed.",5,6,15,28 June 2009
Man on Fire," Liked the way they shot it, but sighed on the phony parts.
","Basically, the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two Scotts(Ridley and Tony). Let's make it straight, the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner/thriller ever made.When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thrillers you can expect. Washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie. One would easily be related to his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road. It's a success that they created a super-dark Mexico city with a lot of shits happening. One would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in Man On Fire. I don't know what would the Mexicans think when they watch this......Well, let's face it again. It's among the best of the Death Wish genre, but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence. It's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let Denzel Washington play the 'missing sheep' type of tragic hero. In the end, they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary. I was checking on IMDb if the movie was based on real events for that...... So that's for your consideration if you also finds the movie's theme is a little bit phony.At the end, I hope one would not take this movie for real.8/10 for art direction/editing/cinematographic/Denzel Washington.",8,0,0,30 September 2009
American Gangster," This is to respond to those spoilers about Washinton's Lucas.
","Does it deserve a 10? Definitely! Before I talk more about the performances and the views the director wanted to show us, I'd like to talk about the cinematographic of American Gangster. The movie's multiple layers rely heavily on the visual differences of each characters' environment. For Frank Lucas, the shots are steady and make him look decent. While for Crowe the shots are always walking and moving. Even in the final confrontation, it just kept Lucas on the stairs of the church but Crowe looking upwardly to him. Despite the many critics about the movie being too far from the reality, it deserves an Oscar nomination just for the visual style.Well, many people are talking about Washintion's Lucas is too decent-looking and better educated than he really is in reality. However in my perception, Washintion just deserve another Oscar nomination for this role because of following reasons. 1, Yes, he looks decent in the movie, but remember he just looks so in most times. The movie is so brilliant that Lucas alter between a decent gentleman and a street-gangster time to time, indicating the truth that he was mentored by another gangster on the street. And all his gentle movements and vanilla scent are just sugar and cream on a gun. 2, his interactions with his siblings and relatives are just realistic that, after all, Frank Lucas and his family came from street, not a university. Washinton's performance honestly expressed the confusion of Lucas as he would never realize the reason his business failed, until he was morally blamed by the good cop.And, I'd like to mention the ending. It totally went out of my expectation. I was expecting Lucas to shoot himself just like other tragic drug-dealers. But I was wrong. The conclusion of the movie is very very socially responsible. The decision Crowe's role made as indicated by the subtitles is inspiring.Excellent.",10,0,2,6 February 2008
The Reader," The Reader is not loud, but has its moments
","The entire movie is complex, multi-dimensional and needs time to digest. It's about the consequences of an affair and the underlying sin/guilt of the affair and the past. 33-year-old Hanna Schmitz had an affair with a 15-year-old boy Michael Berg. 10 years after the end of this summer affair, Hanna was trialled for mass-murdering 300 Jews in the concentration camp. Berg witnessed the whole trial, but was ultimately reluctant to meet Hanna personally. The court sentenced Hanna to be imprisoned for the rest of her life, after Hanna confessed her responsibility as a camp guard of sending women to their deaths. When Hanna was in the jail, Berg couldn't let her go in his memory and kept mailing special presents to her......At the very conclusion of the movie, the audiences were able to see the immorality/guilt/sins of Hanna comes partially from her illiteracy. But in the trial, in the very law process which decided the fate of her, it's the consequences of the guilt that mattered. Throughout the movie, Hanna always looked confused and conflicted. In the affair with the 'kid', aka young Michael, she infected Michael with such confusion and conflict. Lately, in the year 1988, when Michael had returned the tin of money Hanna preserved for the Jew victim who accused her, this flow of confusion had come to a conclusion. The movie can be divided into 2 perspectives, the guilt's and the victim's. Hanna was reviewed by Michael in both perspectives so he had the most mixed and conflicting feeling for Hanna. In some sense, Hanna, the immoral senior woman who seduced Michael into an affair with her, had destroyed Michael's marriage and integrity of family before he had both. So Michael, a victim to her, blamed her for dumping him. On the other side, he sympathized with her in the trial because the trial nonetheless aroused people's hatred against Hanna, who was actually illiterate and shouldn't have been sentenced so harshly. In Hanna's perspective, she took an interest in Michael maybe because Michael was considered an reincarnation of the victims in the camp. She made Michael do the same thing she asked the prisoners to do--to read books for her. Their connection, the reading of the books, had become the only connections again, when Michael began to record the reading of the books he used to read to her. It's actually not hard to understand her suicide in the end, since she doesn't have much to live for, and she couldn't face Michael again. There are of course more than one explanations to all of these, when you consider the movie't not trying to tell a flat story but rather a 3-dimensional one.The movie had a lot of sentimental moments, and tried to discuss the topic about what's the proper criteria of guilt. Should people be prosecuted for real? Does the legalistic system rise people's rage and hatred rather than comforting the victims? It probably took the position that used to belong to The Dark Knight in the best picture Oscar nominations. We can tell this movie is somehow made directly for winning Oscar, so why not give it a chance?",7,2,3,21 February 2009
Shooter," Balanced and traditional, with some brilliant ideas
","Based on novel just like the Bourne trilogy, Shooter deserves a nod for its own stylish sniping scenes and some brilliant ideas in a simple and direct action movie.Recommended to action fans.I don't have to say much about the actions, for you can see by yourself. Actually if I didn't see Bourne Ultimatum before viewing Shooter, I would give Shooter a higher rating. However, through the very traditional car-chasing scene and ultra-typical hero-framing conspiracy,you can sense that, the director Fuqua must be a very modest person. The entire film is shot in a quite balanced way, and you can almost find nothing short in each part. The movie starts with main character Bob Lee, a second-to-none sniper who was once abandoned, now recruited to help stopping a president assassination. However he is framed.If you already knew the end just 20 minutes after the beginning, what is that to expect then? That's what the director wants to show us. You can predict that all the bad guys will get what they deserve, since the movie is so typical in the genre. However as the story went on, some twists really got me, for example, that the archbishop was shot instead of the president in the plot. And a few audiences with sharp eyes may notice it in the first place, but the majority will only find it out along with our hero. The characters are believable. Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee seems a good soldier, yet not unstoppable like Jason Bourne but vulnerable and has his own weakness. In fact this movie is very reviewable for its brilliant lines and a very creepy(yet satisfying) Danny Glover only.There are some moments I found out meaningless or stupid. For example the angry widow played by Kate Mera unnecessarily shot the bad guy to death, was overdone. Another one is the end. The evil senator and evil colonel sit together laughing about their successful plot in a remote house, ignoring the fact that their greatest threat Bob Lee is still alive and active and is most likely to kill them in such an environment. I mean, since they are both politically sophisticated, how could they have left Bob Lee alive despite that he already gave in once(destroy the evidence to the senator)? Apart from that, the movie is shot in detail and again, worth a nod.8/10.",8,0,2,4 September 2007
Inception," Inception: 'bigger the ego, more striving for clarity.'
","Created out of a great filmmaker's ego, Inception gives us this message, 'bigger the ego, more striving for clarity.' I believe, in time, such events are happening: 1, you pay 7 dollars for this movie; 2, you finished seeing it, and you are giving thanks for this mind-messing roller-coaster. 3, though you know it's meant to mess with your mind, you consider Inception highly remarkable. You walked around, recommending it to friends, and already filed your vote for best movie 2010......4, you go on the IMDb, launching yourself into the debating as whether the tin top stopped or not in the end.Such is the win-win proposal proposed by Inception: you pay the money, you feel happy to lose your sense of reality, and you praise it on its way to Oscar. I'd only wish there is a similar proposal proposed by my own daily life. But oops, aren't there enough such proposals in practice? Alcohols, drugs, pornography all give you a very similar proposal to escape the reality. Yet, they are not considered high art, unlike Inception. In fact, the dilemma I face when thinking about this wonderful movie I just saw is that, should I ask for clarity in this story? Because, if I do, I would fall into the debating trap set by the creators of the movie, that I will have to take sides of beliefs to clarify whether there is an absolute reality or everything was just a bubble in Mr. Cobb's mind. But if I don't, how can I find any coherence in this story, or, how am I going to tell my kids about this movie when they reach the age of questioning adults? Nolan's a genius. His movies, from Momento to The Dark Knight, all feature some questions with no absolute answers. Yet, all his movies can be enjoyable in a gritty way. Inception is no different. The multi-layered dream sequences are simply breathtaking, with only the snow mountain scene a bit less captivating. Anyway, it's a much more fluent, enjoyable ride than The Dark Knight (at least in the first viewing). I need to confess I like it, and will support it in the Oscar season. Yet, I like to discuss a bit deeper about the clarity question I brought up.Despite the fact that we are all familiar with Nolan's style, that he likes ambiguity of messages and questions with no absolute answers, one can expect the discussion board here on IMDb has already been filled with blatant debating over the reality/dream problem left by the closing scene in the movie. Relax, I have no intention to throw myself into it, nor do I want to analyze the practicability of raiding another person's dream. One really can't fully enjoy this film if he doesn't forgo the desire of absolute clarity. Actually, some 2600 years ago, King Solomon already said something similar in Ecclesiastes 7:16, that 'Do not be over-righteous, neither be over-wise‚Äîwhy destroy yourself?.....The man who fears God will avoid all extremes.' Some questions contain traps in themselves, thus cannot be answered absolutely, like 'Do you have any solid evidence to say all that happened in Inception took place in Mr. Cobb's dream?' Therefore, bigger the ego, more the struggle for clarity, thus more pain. Actually one doesn't need a context as complex as Inception to get the idea.Concerning complexity, here's a simple comparison between the process of performing an 'inception' and a confession. See, in order to perform an inception, one need to lure the target's consciousness into his sub-consciousness, hiring the best architect to build the scenario while fighting all the target's defending instincts dressing up as 007 goons. Sometimes the whole thing can mess up, and the inception performer even needs to use his own 'limbo' to extract the target's consciousness, risking everything he has. Oh, I still forgot to mention the deliberate way they get pulled out of dreams layer after layer¬Ö¬Ö Sadly, in the movie, their mission objective of this inception is obviously evil, therefore making the whole process as impersonal as possible is also vital. I can't help thinking if I have the technology of inception when I want to confess to my love interest, should I perform an inception on her or just go and tell her that 'I love you'? One would be illogical if he chooses the former (what's the point of making a confession impersonal). Such is the simplicity of doing the right things. Another example is asking for Jesus' help. In illustrating the simplicity of receiving God's grace, Jesus told the listeners, '¬ÖAsk and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.'(Luke 11:9-10) Except when we already know what we are asking is intrinsically wrong, or when we presume God is a bargaining doctor who talks in riddles for a higher fee, we would always enjoy his goodness and grace in praying.The world is often a hostile place, like Mr. Cobb's dream, you never know when the pedestrians would elevate from staring at you to stabbing you. Even worse, there are too many traps and too many wrong questions to ask. Nowadays, technology advancement keeps erasing our definition of right things and wrong things to do, while keeps stressing on doing things right. Inception is really a good movie that reminds to do the right things rather than doing things right.",9,1,5,29 July 2010
Defiance," Comparing this to Shindler's List doesn't do it justice.
","In fact, this may be the most impressive work from director Edward Zwick. The usual Zwick movies tend to play the big scale and go over-dramatic here and there. Movies like The Last Samuri, Blood Diamond and Legends of the Fall all suffer because they are sometimes a bit overdone and sounded phony. Don't get me wrong; he is really a good director in his favorite genre--warfare. Glory is still the best US civil war movie to date with glorious performances. In my opinion, Defiance comes very close in terms of performances. However, what made it stood out is its honesty.Honestly, this movie doesn't portray big-time heroes like Tom Cruise's Nathan Algren or dramatic moments that wrench your guts like in Legends of the Fall. There's no Brad Pitt goes Rambo or Diccaprio goes Commandos. Neither are there lifting long shots with main characters crying on their killed loved ones. Everything was shot in a more tranquilized, restrained style, although not rendering the whole movie in ultra-realism, still delivered a totally different WW2 movie that's worth a nod. There are virtually no very obvious dramatic turns in this character/plot-driven storyline. All characters have their ego or responsibilities and these things don't change as cheap miracles like other movies. Most impressive achievement is that the director managed to keep the audiences on the edge of their conscience and compassion for 2 hours and still entertained, bringing in positive messages. It's a good movie that tells us the greatest events/moments were usually off the screen, and a group of desperate, weak, sick and lost people can work out their miracle out of the darkest war. The last moments were very inspiring with the true mini-biographies of main characters.Defiance is almost not biased or overdone, which gave it another quality, which allowed you to view this movie in many perspectives. The scene in which the angry Jews beat the German prisoner to death is a good example of character-development and real history reflection. You can definitely interpret it in many different ways.Like the other Zwick movies, Defiance was made with great artistic values. Camera works fantastically in the jungle. The changing seasons and the wild defined the movie's desperate undertone. Not to mention the haunting music that is nominated for Oscar. I really like seeing a good director like Zwick taking notes from other great filmmakers and surpasses himself. Way to go, Mr. Edward!.Defiance is a great movie, and for all great movies' sake, don't try to compare it with Shindler's List or Pianist. It's good enough on its own. And, I still don't understand why people formed an expectation that it's trying to make an artistic breakthrough like Shindler. After all, this is just about some very ordinary Jews trying to survive.8.4/10",8,2,5,4 August 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Quite an interesting re-imagination of a classic novel.
","Before seeing Sherlock Holmes, I was warned by a senior friend that Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes went intolerably far from its source material. As a self-respected Holmes fan, I gave up seeing in theater. Luckily enough, I picked it up in HD format several months later, and it gave me a lot positive surprises.That being said, I've seen quite a few Holmes movies before this blockbuster, and I wasn't too impressed by those poor adaptations just yet. None of them had a Holmes that lived up to the caliber of original novel's spirit. Still, I wasn't expecting a radical re-imagination of that meditatively brilliant role at all; I don't feel the desire to see him on the screen. Maybe that's because all these years the world has had too many super detectives jumping-examining-analyzing on and off the screen. Most recent greatest detective stories all stocked their firepower in the characters instead of the mystery(L.A.Confidential). Will this particular movie which had a bizarre feeling of Iron Man in 19th century (the trailer) do any different? To my surprise, Sherlock Holmes feels very fresh, comical, surreal, yet if there can ever be any performances that really is that inspiring, mind-bending as the title character, it would be Robert Downey Jr. Knowing that it's a Guy Ritchie production, I expected the same magnitude of mischief, mayhem and crude humor like Rock'n Rolla, Snatch, and Lock Stock. But thankfully the final product's efficiency in relating audiences' minds to their loved roles is far better than one can expect, as long as one's not a religious fanatic who believed in everything in Holmes books. So long as you care to know, the story opens with Holmes apprehending a shadowy serial killer whose high profile in the society shocked London, who later turned out to possess the capability to rise from grave, wield black magics and wreck havocs around London and terrorize the public. Holmes had limited time to figure out the opponent's master plan, which also involved far more people than one's imagination......I guess you can't find a single case in Holmes books that either exactly matches this movie plot or feels totally different. That means the movie's a very brilliant adaptation that gains the strength from both the source material's roots and the screenwriter's originality. It's a story that keeps your brain processing the data just like Holmes himself while also convince you to sit back and enjoy the ride with your popcorn. With no presumption for the plot, fans can find many Eastern eggs and accept the director's goodwill in them. For example, all the scientific devices in the movie had their originality from the books, but the fast pacing hinders you from remembering their exact location in the novels. In terms of characters, although I am not too thrilled to see Holmes having such an obvious soft spot for Irene, all the characters play their parts in the story pretty smooth. Moriaty's involvement in the plot is too obvious to entertain the fans, but luckily the makers were aware of it. I was puzzled by the fact that Downey got a golden globe for the title role before I see this one. Now I've seen it, I can tell you the bottom-line is that no one had been so convincing as well as entertaining in this role. It's worth seeing for that if you don't have another reason.While supremely sophisticated in Science knowledge and detective technique, Holmes was never so interested in ideology and politics. The makers are insightful enough to get this right in the adaptation, which leaves some key messages to be openly interpreted. After all, it's a story about the whole London in panic for black magics and Satanic villains who claim to be Satanic. It's a Holmes point-of-view to visually reveal the clash between spiritual assumptions and experimental science in the transition of 19th and 20th centuries, and the movie definitely takes Holmes side to criticize or mock universally at religions and spiritual beliefs. In this sense, it's acceptable to see churches having a mental breakdown in the storyline. It's also a remind to me that it's not reality, but Holmes, down to his fictional bone and love-it-or-hate-it roots and ideological notions. After all, Christianity is never really about anything indestructible human can possess or wield, but rather about right way to live your destructible life.

WALL¬∑E," Wall E is one of the kind cartoon movie.
","To date, this is the most unique movie produced by Pixar so far. Unlike the more hyped Brad Bird's two movies(Incredibles and Rattatoule), this one really delivers a new classic. I think it's a one-of-the-kind cartoon because: 1, it's so hilarious fun to watch the most impossible event happening on the big screen: robots' romance, which naturally leads to the conclusion that Wall E has a really good script, a script that is so freely written that it ignores all the common senses and scientific notions. It's virtually a futuristic comedy version of Romeo and Juliet, presenting the forbidden love between robots(supposedly forbidden). Prepare to have some revolution in your mind if you are going to see this one because this is the most romantic sci-fi so far.2, concerning the script, you can argue there are plot holes: for example, if Eva's mission to the earth is to search for any life form on the earth rather than destroy them, why would she have such a mass-destructive weapon, which detonates so many times when she sees something moving around? Secondly, if she was searching for any form of life, why would she ignore the cockroach? Furthermore, Eva's spaceship, which traveled through several galaxy systems to reach the colony ship, didn't perform a super-space jump, which means it was traveling very fast. But Wall-E was able to hang on it all through the process, how did it happen? Well, I still want to argue...But stop! Nobody would spoil the fun when watching this movie because they are all caught up in the lovely characters and obsessed with this greatest inhuman love ever presented. This is how Pixar writes a screenplay, we should all bow and learn from them.3, The technical perspective: easily flawless. The abandoned earth is so beautifully decorated that you would believe it's real, which reminds me of I Am Legend. The physics, mechanics of robots are all convincing enough, and have been a carnival for eyes. Wow, there are so many great things to say about the movie, really can't say them one by one. But believe me, if Wall-E doesn't get Best Animated feature for Oscar and best screenplay nomination, kick my butt!",10,0,2,14 August 2008
The Blind Side," Reminds me of lyrics of Amazing Grace.
","The Blind Side has been marketed as an Encouragement movie in Asia, and many Oriental audiences clearly have this message received that the movie is praising USA for having the best education system that inspired equality, humanity, etc..While in my opinion, this movie very much reminded me of the lyrics of Amazing Grace, that 'through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come'. Just like the beginning of the movie, this story is not about encouragement of success, but about the predicaments. Compared to his friends in the same block, Michael Oher is a rare case that he didn't bounce into others' surviving logics of violence and pride, though he's totally homeless and hopeless. Yet, I can't imagine if I were him when the Tuohy family accepted him into the house, how hard would I work and behave to win their approval. Very luckily, Michael Oher wasn't me. Out of some stubbornness of holding true to his own feelings, his heart leads him to choose otherwise again and again, thus unfolded this story beautifully.Note that the Tuohy family wasn't the first family to shelter Oher. The P.E. teacher's beautiful reasoning got him into the school in the first place, and the warm-hearted Big Tony also gave him a place to stay. But, as the movie showed us, you can love but you can't enforce it. Both the decision of the school and the decision of Big Tony were pushed decisions. It can all end up 'let somebody else be Christian about him'. In 2 Corinthians 9:7, it says 'each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.' Guess it applies here. Our actions, especially those in the name of charity, usually starts as a delightful little touch of love and mercy, and dies in the name of responsibility. Oher wrote a sad essay 'White Walls', indicating that the stakeholders around him all did their parts pretty hard though their 'hard' and 'best' is not enough. Yet, God didn't knock on each of their foreheads saying 'you are not treating Oher well enough!' Instead, God inspired a family that actually can do better and really have a vision for a life with Michael Oher. With 3 sentences, Leigh Anne Tuohy invited this unknown and possibly dangerous factor into their house. These 3 sentences are, 'Why are you going to the gym?' 'Do you have any place to stay?''Don't you dare lie to me!' They don't even sound kind enough as invitation, yet they are out of a woman's love, so personally, so honest and powerful.And that started this marathon test for this woman's love. The first time, it was because the 10000$ coach has been ruined by Oher's massive body. But, Leigh Anne just said, 'Do you want to stay here?' The second time, it was gossips from Leigh Anne's reference group, who are at least as rich as her. They questioned her generosity was out of some 'white guilty thing' and pointing out Collins (the daughter of Leigh Anne) might become a sex victim of the massive Michael Oher. Mrs. Tuohy only said 'shame on you' to those gossipers, but she didn't hesitate to ask about her daughter's feeling either. The third time was the car accident which Michael was mainly responsible. Again the pressure was on Leigh Anne as the public doubted her love for this boy, but she bravely ignored the public and comforted her boy. The fourth time√Ç‚Ä¶... It never ended, and it never will. That makes me envy the USA system and USA culture, but oops, if their system and culture are so perfect that love grows out of ground just by itself, why do Michael and Leigh Anne have to overcome so many prejudices and bitterness? I think, questioned to the end, system can't love, and despite many schools made biblical quotes their motto, system surely can't do anything in Jesus name. If a system can admit Oher into the school out of Christian duty, then this system can also dismiss Oher from the school logically, fairly, systematically in Jesus name. And anyone not completely ignorant would see the fact that nothing would be achieved in this way.We are creatures living in a machine, but I believe we are not machines. 'Don't you dare lie to me' again was heard near the end of the movie. In the name of fair and righteousness the system questioned all that Tuohys had done for Michael. This is a reasonable doubt that the Tuohys loved Michael so much only because they are boosters of their university. It's the toughest test for Leigh Anne so far, and for the first time in the movie she couldn't find a way to instantly cope with it. She feared that Michael can run away and never come back. Finally, it's Leigh Anne's leap of faith to tell Michael that 'it's your decision, you life', that again allowed their love to triumph over doubts. See? The system has to stay neutral to be fair and functional. And, if the system has to assume we humans are also only machines, I guess it's our duty to prove otherwise. That would require a continuous dedication and courage to come through many dangers, toils and snares. And the only way to do that as I have come to know is to believe. I surely hope that my fellow audiences don't only draw their conclusions of this movie on Dale Carnegie's books and theories, but also listen to Amazing Grace, that 'It is grace that brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home.'",9,0,2,30 August 2010
Despicable Me," Beauty and Beast series: Despicable Me.
","Well, recently I've seen two films that could sum up the basic Beauty and Beast plot. One of them is Universal studio's Despicable me, casting a lot of fancy names among the charming voices. The other one is called Suspect X, which was made in 2008. We can really have some insights into the difference between the Easterners and Westerners comparing these two movies. So here is my Beauty and Beast series.Despicable Me has, in many ways, reminded me of the early Shirley Temple movies in 1930s. Though, you'd be surprised that even me, an oriental, have seen most of Temple's classics like 'Littlest Rebel''The little Colonel'. It's always the same formula--adults have been unhappy until they meet the magnificent Temple. Actually, the true magic comes from it was the process of transformation, that beasts can transform back to humans with love and lightheartedness. The Oriental movies, on the contrast, often feature this process in the other direction, that humans essentially become something else. Suspect X is one of the examples, and please feel free to refer to my review for that title.My criticism for Despicable Me is only of the slightest, that the characters in this movie apparently have a blood tie with Tom and Jerry. Anyone in the movie, heroes or villains, practically cannot die even if they get smashed by moon. Also, stealing the moon is a somewhat romanticized act, a villainous master plan that's actually considered cute and silly. Therefore, it doesn't really sum up real criminals and their behaviors.But, isn't that where this film shined? Isn't that a perfect way to illustrate to both adults and children that there's no point to be a champion in negative ways? The only other thing as silly as Gru's moon-stealing plan, was the bed book preserved so dearly by the 3 orphans. I can't agree more with Gru that it's story-less. Yet, the most heartfelt scene in the entire movie was exactly when Gru reluctantly reads it to put the trio to sleep. While he was performing the 3 little kittens' roles with his fingers, he actually discovered his own transformation, a transformation from the gritty, twisted Darth-Vader-wanna-be to 3 little orphans' real father. Love happens, even if love can only be expressed in the stupidest way. Isn't that exactly like how the God communicated with us? We are bound in time and space, and it seems our way of stupidity cannot be stopped, like all the killings, wars, etc. Our proud wisdom, utmost, is to make poems of the killings, wars, sex, so on so forth. Yet, our creator found a way to communicate his love to us. Suppose Gru still couldn't help thinking the book's stupid, he can never receive the message from this beautiful relationship. The tricky thing is, it's not the 3 little orphans who needed this message of love and inspiration, it's Gru who needed it the most. It took him some time to struggle, and then he finally accepted it. In the Bible, Jesus told us that if we don't return to children's form, we can't enter his kingdom of heaven. That reminded me not every villain is as lucky as Gru, so how should I know I possess a complete soul to love, or more importantly, how should I know I have love?On his road to world-class villain, Gru made many mistakes to prevent him from being a real villain. Yet, he has done some wrong deeds if you count in his motivations. He mistreated people all around, attempted to feed the orphans like dogs, etc. Still, there seemed to be some kind of guardian angel on his shoulder who drags him from doing actual harms every time. It's a comedic nod that such a person as Gru is nice inside, just like the Beast in Beauty and Beast, that no matter how hard he tries; the real badness is just too bad for him. Plus for Gru, he practically slipped into the father role quite successfully in all the evil attempts. So, if we find out later that a mistake was actually a necessary one on our way to the right path, does it still count as a mistake? According to the Bible, we as sinners at our best can only be honest enough to admit our mistakes just like Gru's home-made bed book. Yet in God's hands, love can cover sins. Gru was taught to seek forgiveness and redemption, and the orphans were taught to forgive and accept. The salvation, the love is just completed in their relationship. I guess all the mistakes still count as mistakes, yet the girls chose to let go of their father's mistakes. It's beautiful.Theoretically, we should be more physically capable to love as we grow up, but why do we feel more chills instead of warmth from love? When I was little, I listened to Beauty and Beast and believed. As I have grown up, I became more inclined to accept that 'all people are of social products, and there's no intrinsic goodness in humans' (Popular idea since Kant and Marx). However, this idea, subtly comes from Gru's '3 little kittens' book, tells me that as we grow up our capability to be loved had drastically reduced. Gru needed a stupid bed book to return to child's form to be loved, and I needed another book considered stupid by many to return to child's form to be loved. That's the Bible.",8,1,2,2 August 2010
Mary and Max," Oh my precious......
","Mary and Max features two different pen-pals suffered different dysfunctions from different continents some 30 years ago, but if the idea already made you yarn, let's be honest, you should see a doctor.Just after the first viewing, I have already updated my top 5 animation movies with Mary And Max among them. The reason, it's a perfect illustration of the thousands of layers of life, keeping a high profile of those imperfections by symbolizing them but allowing the love among humans to flow to the last, warming the audiences indifferently. (Well, as long as you don't bash a film because of some improper contents for children.) Don't be freaked out by the weird art design. Actually, those sensitive ones should have already felt the underlying irony in those sad, agonized faces filling out the movie. From the carves on a mailbox to every adult alike in Mary and Max's world, 'beauty' is but a word describing extinction. Mary's face, figure and everything alike had a deep feeling of asymmetric and depression while Max lives in a tottered balance so fragile but also so ironic, portraying a sick man in a sick world. Through their different but same pains they knew each other. And the whole experience is such an unbelievable flow of black comedy that blew Fight Club and Little Miss Sunshine away.I have to be honest, that this movie is not intended for kids and really shouldn't be promoted to anyone under 15. Yes, there are controversial contents. And if again you hated it purely because of that, I have to express my sympathy for you as you are exactly like Max or any other paranoid people. (Poor Max......) Finally, I would wish Up and this movie to contend Oscar in different years since I loved both of them. But for this year I have to express my reverence to Mary and Max, a multi-layered, honest, inspiring, hilarious, light-hearted dark comedy.10/10. Just give it an Oscar...please.",10,3,10,1 December 2009
X-Men: First Class," A great production with some rough corners.
","Before I went into cinema for X-Men:First Class, a few media reviews really had cranked up my expectations. So, let's be honest, and say that this movie was so close to meet my expectations. The filmmakers did a fantastic job knitting up everything in the first act, made it very character-driven. Nothing in the first 40 minutes makes you feel half-cooked because neither Charles' nerd personality nor Eric's washed-up revenger aura ever feels old. The whole movie basically feeds you with a great sense of retrospective spy movie. The same approach was at its peak in another superhero marvel--The Incredibles. It works fantastic if you factor in the fact that X-men:First Class is not a cartoon. There are action sequences set throughout the movie deliberately minimizing the use of CGI, which added significant believability to the film. The 2nd act, which to my surprise, didn't really slow down for character-building. The movie is fantastic in bringing actions and characters to a balance, which worked just like the first two X-men films. I was ready to be bombarded by the massive amount of CGI in the climax of the film, which if not for the restraining, smart usage of special effects during the first half, would not be so obviously artificial. That issue, along with my hectic expectations for the drama between Charles and Eric did make the climax of the film a bit, uh, unsatisfying. I was really thinking about if they can wrap up everything until Charles said half-mockingly, 'I'd soon be bald.'The new Mystique, played by beautiful Jennifer Lawrence, was at the heart of the whole drama side of this action film. Mystique's character building was maybe the best compared to the main guys, Charles and Eric. Mystique's struggles of identity crisis, despite its cartooned roots in X-Men universe, is heartfelt. It's especially true to those living in a multi-ethnic environment. Mystique was so outstanding that both Charles and Eric had left something to be desired, in my opinion. Charles and Eric on the other hand, felt like they were already in their full-blown form. It's kind of hard not to factor in my own interpretations and assumptions when I tried to appreciate their development. At last, the movie is complemented with a great score. 8/10. Way to go, X-Men. If you like to hear about my interpretation about Charles, please feel free to read on.So, here's my interpretation about Charles's development in First Class. Charles was born in the upper class of his world, which formed his view of the world and mindset in a mainstream way. His mind-reading abilities allowed him to walk in the rains of social life without getting wet, which formed his illusion of being the mighty leader/father figure of mutants. If not for Magneto, he'd probably never feel the pain of belittled, incompetent, and incomplete. His disability to walk, along with the loss of his sister, aka Mystique, humbled him and sent him on the way to be closer to the a father figure/authentic peacemaker. Alas for Charles, no matter how many times he had read Mystique's mind, there were actually more delicate matters than he could fathom that was going on in her. Don't we, the self-respected intellectuals often do the same with our families? We sometimes feel like what's truly important is only arm's length away, yet in our frustration we turn to pervert or twist it. If that's the case for you, then may God help us as he helped Professor X.",8,3,7,3 June 2011
Iron Man," Judged by the trailer, it's silly. Judged by the first viewing, it's good.
","Well, about 10 months ago I first saw the trailer of Iron Man, in which Robert Donney Jr. plays a very clich√©d and silly 'iron man', which reminds me of the 1960's Japanese cartoon series 'Atom Boy', especially when Iron Man flies by jetting from the feet. In a moment, I was telling myself, 'This is gonna be another piece of CGI rubbish.' But, I was totally wrong. on May 2nd I walked into the theater in Chinese Mainland, waiting for a 2-hour letdown(Which I spent to gather some former classmates). The movie begins with Robert Donney being blown away by his own bomb, and then kidnapped by some terrorist. Then we saw a long flashback about Tony Stark(Donney)'s life style. Donney has been famous for giving noisy and 'rap' performances in many charming characters. This time he definitely did it again. While the audiences are being convinced by the conversion from a play boy to a super hero, which is tuned down by the makers, the movie just kept teasing everyone's eyeballs with exciting actions and a sense of 'Donney' humor. The 'escaping from terrorists base' scene was considered to be a really big stereotype in my mind, but it worked out very intense and interesting.Jeff Bridges and Patrow share the same amount of supporting roles. However, it is definitely Bridges to win the applause. Even though Patrow didn't blow me away, still she does no harm to the movie. Very smart screenplay and editing,worth a node of Academy's technical Awards.8.4/10 better than Spiderman 3.",8,1,2,3 May 2008
Toy Story 3," Identity Crisis: Toy Story 3.
","What if somebody come up and tell you, 'hey, I need to tell you that all your life up to today is just a series of unhealthy obsessions'? For me, that might just be the case, which gave me a perfect reason to see Toy Story 3, a masterpiece of identity crisis.In Toy Story, Buzz Light-year needed to cope with the fact that he was made to pretend to be a space ranger to entertain kids, though he personally believed he's really a space ranger. In Toy Story 2, Woody and his new friends needed to decide whether to stay with Andy though they fully realized what would happen when Andy's done with them. Toy Story 3 has a strong premise that this day actually came. It's even worse that Andy's mom pushed Andy to make a tough final decision about his beloved toys. Andy struggled, and decides to take only Woody to the university as a monument for all his toys and childhood times. He packed the rest of toys in a bag and decided to put them aside in the attic, yet the reality took another road right into the most menacing adventure the toys ever faced. Not knowing which toy will meet his/her demise in this last episode in a trilogy, we laughed, and we sobbed through the movie. And will they make it home? I will let you to find out in theater if you haven't seen the movie yet. Spoilers alert.Granted that Pixar has this magic to make a bunch of CGI plastics talk and act so lively that, we feel they are more alive than our daily lives. Granted also is the suspension of disbelief, when you can actually hug and play with these characters in human sizes in Disneyland. It should be cool to shake hands with Woody, telling him 'you are one of the sheriffs I admired'. Disney has made these dreams come true over the years when kids cried upon the send-off of their beloved cartoon hero/heroine. However, after Toy Story 3, you should be clam that your kids learn to accept what was coming so peacefully. That's how intrinsically satisfying Toy Story 3 was. I don't have kids yet, but I pretty much grew up with this series (Toy Story was released when I was 9). Believe me that I am grateful to see such a grand, deep send-off, so heartfelt.Though experienced movie-goers probably can recognize Losto as the villain within the first looks, I still think about his causes. I want to know how he actually felt. I'd like to know if put into his shoes would I do any better? See, Losto was abandoned so casually by the family he was in, that after quite a heck of journey through the wildness he only found out he's 'replaced' by an identical bear. Suppose toys really have hearts and feelings, this agonizing pain would be unbearable. Though I doubt the same situation would ever happen to me (which was described in 'The Sixth Day'), I definitely can see the trend that the definition of a 'good man' is rapidly collapsing into good worker, good husband, etc. And even the definition of a 'good worker' is collapsing into efficiency, accuracy, etc. In 10 years, the measure of a 'good man' will never be the same again. The point is, mass-manufacturing of desirable skills and traits had seen their successes, yet something important about human is lost in translation. The toys, in any era, are disposable. Today with mass-production, toys are naturally considered highly substitutable. Toys' lives only last until that particular owner is done with them. If that's the way this world works, then toys are only pitiful shadows of another flawed species, us.In my opinion, that's why we'd better believe we have souls rather than just a series of complex chemical reactions in brains (according to Watson and Crick). Otherwise, we are just more complicated toys with better mechanics, which function until the day of breaking. And, that's the way Lotso looks at his kind. What Lotso has inside him instead of a 'soul', as I see, is an angry 'ghost', or something different, unspeakable to Woody and his friends. That's probably why the joker toy described Lotso as a 'monster'. In fact, by believing he and his kind is nothing more than mechanic trash, one like Lotso can really become so. C.S. Lewis once said in his book 'The Problem of Pain' that souls exist in relationships, like we only get a grasp of an animal's soul when we are its human masters. For toys, you'd believe toys have souls because they have a heartfelt relationship with Andy. For us however, everyone needs a relationship with his or her creator, who made sure in the beginning of this world, that we are not disposable mechanics, but living humans in the image of him.In the end, yes, we may face our demises in many ways, be it in furnace or in soil, on sickbeds or streets. Yes, we may not find every sentimental value, every romantic relationship everlasting. But beyond all the present ugliness and darkness there is a purpose made for us. A great man once said, 'To truly love a person is to look on him/her in the way God has ever wanted.' Beyond Andy's needs of toys, beyond Molly's needs of toys, beyond Lotso's hierarchy of toys, beyond Stinky Pete's version of hygiene eternal life¬Öin a gallery, and even beyond mom's eagerness to see her boy growing up, Andy made this deliver once and for all, thus delivered our beloved toys out of their seemingly destined ways of getting loved and dumped again. They won't last forever, but they won't lose faith in each other again. We won't live forever either, but are we ready to look on ourselves in God's way? You know, right now, he is smiling at you from somewhere.",10,1,1,16 August 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Brought me back to the golden age of Tom and Jerry.
","I had a struggle as to give it a 7 or 8 'cause I gave Up an 8. So how to justify the difference or the distance they had was quite hard to decide. I finally gave it an equal 8.Frankly, Ice Age 3 is a good movie that doesn't really need a review. People went to see it expecting what exactly it will come out. Yet it's free of foul language, inappropriate information that other blockbusters may have. And they got exactly what they want and came back smiling with the whole family. End of story? Not exactly. The cartoon context is so unique in that you can invent your whole environment and creatures to ensure the technical eligibility, while throwing in your real-life friends for fun and for differentiation. For those HD quality fanatics, they would buy the Blu-ray with no doubt, while for most families they just want to laugh and laugh again with an ironical feeling. This kind of subtlety and awareness are not scarce in recent animations, but fits into the context of Ice Age 3 perfectly. Just like Tom & Jerry, the characters may really fight/kill their butts off, yet they still know it's a cartoon. So when a teenager sees the interactions between Scrat and Scrate, he laughs his teeth off every time. But when a middle-aged couple see the scenes, they laugh at first but had a mixed feeling later.The best thing about this movie is that it knows what it is, and surely it doesn't want to compete with Up in terms of sentimental value and life philosophy. In some way, it's even more honest and pure. However it succeeded with a much simpler formula but offered equal fun and maturity. So why not giving it a chance? P.S. Scrat and Scrate made a cinema gem with their Tom and Jerry charm.",8,1,3,1 August 2009
Beowulf," Great attempt to eliminate boundary between animation and real-person movie, although didn't surpass God of War.
","This is a great attempt to eliminate boundary between animation and real-person movie. Note that the movie's budget is 70,000,000 dollars which is way lower compared to early movies like 'Final Fantasy'(2001). However, 'Final Fantasy'(2001) is a failure for a movie, especially one everyone was expecting to deliver some real material. Beowulf is highlighted as it's violent and gory, as alluring as the beauties animated.Earlierly, the definition of 3D cartoon movies was almost a copyright of Disney(Pixar). The characters are all comically simple, and their movements are all cartooned jerks convincing in the imagined world of the makers(remember the movements of humans in Incredibles and Rattatoulie). All the others withing this genre also avoid to be realistic. Instead, the emphasis would be jokes which is predominantly a theme for American-style CGI cartoons. Now in Beowulf, all the humans are in normal size and figures, winding the swords and axes humanly instead of comically. To realize the natural interactions of hundreds of different roles isn't a piece of cake for any studio, not even anyone in Pixar. And, don't you think it's a great idea to make something for grown-ups only to change the concept of 3D cartoon? Feel the lights and shadows on Beowulf and Angelina Jolie's skins.Plus, Beowulf is not simply some video-game alike slaughtering fast-food movie, although a lot of people expected it to be(I was one of them). Note that more than half of the movie was about the dramatical main role Beowulf's conversation with other people(or demons), therefore the hardship to overcome in making could be the detailed, sometimes implied expressions and feelings of the characters. Every movement of faces can be considered as a single piece of art, not to mention the tragic fates combined with North Europe's severe climate. If you concentrate on humanity drama of Beowulf, you won't be disappointed for sure.But, Beowulf is not perfect. although I sincerely appreciate the effort Robert Zemeckis took to make this superb reality-approximating animation, I have to point out the weakness lies within the PACE. If you've ever played the PS2 game 'God of War', you would surely be expecting Beowulf for some non-stop fighting sequences shot in the harsh, bloody myth style seasoned with cool lines. Don't worry the movie surely contains all these elements, but they fell apart. All these elements are not combined efficiently enough to make your blood boil. Every time, the battle finished too fast after our hero enters his full-loaded fighting status. If the director could put all 3 sequences of fighting together and edit them to be like in 'God of War', we will surely be awed by it. Stated in general, Beowulf is not equipped with enough exciting moments.Simply there are no twists in the movie, the theme is simple and 90% of the story can be predicted. But if you are interested in seeing the best real-human-size animated drama so far, you should go to cinema now.",8,3,10,16 November 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," A magical blend of fairy tale and family drama.
","If you are to invent a story about a fox family surviving all the crude farmers in the world, would you also invent a nursery rhyme for it? Of course you will. But the awesomeness in this simple story comes from many other things.The weird, slightly exaggerating human portraits plus the fairy tale set-ups and everything already gave this story an exotic touch. Having George Clooney and Meryl Streep dubbing the Fox couple certainly dumped more grown-up ingredients into it. After so many years of Wallace and Gromit or Coraline, you might just become picky about production values of clay animations. Try to sit through the first minute realizing it's not as polished as other technically-excellent animations, and it will reward you a lot more. Seeing the twitching movements and little mannerisms of Mr. Fox in classic songs is really one-of-a-kind enjoyment. simply put, you don't really need much brain to enjoy it, but you certainly need more sensibility to fetch everything intended.One thing good about fairy tale is you don't really need to explain why the protagonists are robbers, and why do they kill chickens, and stuff like that. Down to its core, it's still a very heart-warming family drama. For the record, if you don't want your little boy to adapt a crime career like Mr. Fox, you'd better sit through this fantastic movie with him because it's gonna render some great sweet family talk!Go to see it! 9/10 for heartwarming fun!",9,0,1,17 January 2010
The Social Network," What this generation has come to be?
","When you picture a villain in your mind, I guess the most convenient way is to think up a hideous face, and put the many undesirable qualities in your opinion behind that face, so he would speak the same awful languages you've come to be familiar with. I wouldn't be surprised if the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in this movie was come up in this fashion.With 95/100 on Metacritic, 3 Oscars and so much hype, The Social Network can be called a monumental success in Hollywood. David Fintcher may have again proved that he is not only a storytelling master, but also a mastermind of medias, as evidenced by the convoluted nature of the Social Network project, and the explosive media coverages after-wards. I believe this movie will be discussed, analyzed and staying in its controversial status for the next decade. I, for one, am totally compelled to find out about the real Zuckerberg. However, such interests only garnered me more curiosity in digging deeper about him. After all, the aftertaste of watching a big screen villainous main protagonist is strong, especially if such a figure feels like your unfriendly neighbor who is in possession of similar, uh, admirable qualities.Liked I said, I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the real-life Zuckerberg is quite friendly, and easy to get along with. However, the real issue here, is how I should live with the fact that, as a fellow geek/nerd, would what Zuckerberg wants to say be similar to what I want to say? Having been following the discussion board here, I cannot help but notice that people are generally offended and raging out against Mr. Z portrayed in this movie, pulling no punches in calling him 'douche-bag' 'self-absorbed' and so on. Some also said he's probably autistic and even aspergers. Moreover, some went on to say that being autistic doesn't justify what Mr.Z has done in the movie, which I totally agree. But still, under all these fancy terms, these extravagant wrappings, what would Zuckerberg feel? Is he really comfortable with being a modern day Butch Cassidy, aka a role model for renegades and rebels? Thus I remembered a time where all people felt compelled to justify themselves to their subjects. The rich wished to justify his wealth either by appearances of hard-working or good heritage; the religious would wish to justify themselves by their deeds, as holy as possible; while rebels generally overlooked, or lived in the limbo created by other people's justifications. If Mr. Z was a 1st-century Jew (actually he's a 21st-century Jew), he would most likely end up as someone like the prodigal son in the Bible's 'Prodigal Son Parable', instead of the billionaire he is now. The sheer difference of these two outcomes drives me to ask, if Mr. Z in the movie, a rebel and a billionaire, felt the need to justify himself? Or more personally to us commoners, would he feel totally free and more-evoluted if he reaches a point of completely no need to justify himself, when he's crowned with all these paramount achievements? To my disappointment, when I saw his business card, which said, 'I am Mark Zuckerberg, Bixxx', I knew instantly he was still compelled to justify himself and his legacy, just like the old-fashioned religions. This business card is essentially saying, 'I am the Lord of this business, and this is my Ten Commendaments for you, which is actually only One-commandments, that I AM Mark Z, and you're my Bixxx.' Why is that? Aside from raising more brows and attract more medias, wouldn't 2 Billion dollars have made him feel safe already, that he needs stunts like this? That's when I realized that, the sheer irony for people like Sean Parker and Mr.Z in the movie, is that they went so far in denying their religious nature, and the fact that by saying something like 'This is our generation, our rules', they're essentially creating new religions, for both themselves and the others . The prodigal son in the Bible, despite his rebelliousness and reckless, childish behaviors to destroy himself, saw no point in gratifying his own namesake, or writing down his own legacy and epics. However, we modern people are so into raging against the old values and creating our own, that when something backfires at us to make us feel there are after all something wrong with the whole idea, we are only left in a position to regret (or like Mr.Z did in the movie, expressing his contempt to the judge and jury).The movie ended with the friendship between the two lead roles presumably broken forever, while the lawyer got some insight into Zuckerberg's deeply troubled self, which he seldomly leak to his 500 million Facebook friends. Once a friend of mine told me that, justification is for reconciliation, at least that's what happened in the Prodigal Son parable that the Father reconciled beautifully with his prodigal son. The Bible told me that whether you're an authentic A-hole or just someone who tries very hard to be one, you're welcome to accept Jesus' love, and be reconciled with him. I truly wish Mr. Z and Saverin can be reconciled in a graceful fashion, too.",8,0,0,21 May 2012
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Beyond critics and box office.
","These days I tried to re-watch the first Indy trilogy, and found the first one--Raiders of the Lost Ark most technically advancing even though it's made in 1981. It had won multiple Oscars and was even nominated for the Best Picture, showing how much impact it had on the whole industry or even the whole world. Among the 3 movies, Indianna Jones and the Last Crusades is unfortunately, the most dated.The fact it is dated is not hard to see. Look at the CGIs and you will notice they are so obvious that, even Temple of Doom was a better case of effects-driven movie. ROLA pretty much invented this genre, and brought the CG into a new decade; TOD advanced the actions especially the tunnel roller-coaster scenes; Last Crusade had also got so many memorable action scenes relying mostly on stunt-men and CGI, but the former is always covering the latter. Anyway, the final result is not optimal.However, Last Crusade is still the best among its brothers. Its recognition as a plot/characters-driven story is so often ignored based on the fact that it's an Indy movie. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is priceless in every scene, especially when they interact with the female Nazi. For audiences above 30, it's even better to see their dysfunctional relationship being fixed during the search of the holy grail. Even they delete most of the action sequences, the movie would still be a very good dramedy about father-son relationship.Beyond all these values, Last Crusade inherited the New Age blood from the creators that main characters are portrayed as Renaisance Men who dwelled in reason and science. This was more obvious in the first two movies, but like a miracle, Last Crusade introduced Henry Jones into the franchise, who brought back the voice of the old-school believers. Many disputes between him and Indy were initiated upon their different beliefs. But with the experience of Holy Grail, they were able to accept each other, and delivered an important message that faith in the divine power would live longer than immortality. No wonder I heard a lot western audiences see it as a 'holy' movie. Anyway, Last Crusade will impress with some core values of Christiannity, yet it's not a gospel movie.In short, Last Crusade is a minor disappointment in technology, but a superb character story and help delivered a good message. It will last longer than all the others in its genre.",10,0,0,3 August 2009
The Proposal," Better than I thought, Sandra Bullock made it sweet and honest.
","With a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy plot, 'the only male stripper in Alaska', some crude jokes involving a granny, The Proposal wasn't on my watch-list in the beginning. After some terrible experience of Made of Honor or this kind of rubbish, I totally refused to see this movie.However, when the chance actually come I saw it, and thought all the clich√©s are still right there, but in a forgivable way. With some good, layered performances and some honest and sweet scenes near the end, the movie is actually watchable, and with some good messages.There were some reasons that I totally despised the idea behind the movie. A female manager in her 40s propose to a subordinate in his 20s to realize a fraud wedding? That would be disgusting. Not to mention Andrew(Ryan Reynolds) is principally what we call a big kid, that he had dysfunctional relationship with his father and could more relate to powerful females. In the movie, the justification that Andrew really loved Margaret is in their 3-year employment relationship Andrew already allowed Margaret to grow on him. Knowing all the ugly sides in the life, Andrew would be the best candidate for Margaret's husband. Right there, I got the message the movie wanted to send, that a family should be forgiving enough for the family member no matter how much they deviated from the traditions. Sometimes the point is not to accept the choice your family members made, but to accept the fact that they have the freedom to make their own choices. I, like Andrew's father, still have 1000 reasons to disagree with Andrew's marriage, but I got the message. Unfortunately these messages have to be watched very closely and heartedly to be found. That is quite a challenge if you hold the movie as a clich√© to the very end.All that was realized by Sandra Bullock's performance that in some sense worth an Oscar nomination. Her transition from the cold, mean manager to the broken soul exposed to Andrew's family was very convincing, especially in the last 15 minutes. Also, she was able to totally cover Ryan Reynolds' pale performance. Thanks to the detailed character study, the movie surpassed my expectation.7/10.",7,6,9,19 October 2009
Princess Mononoke," Behold, the Princess Mononoke.
","If this can't be called the peak of anime art, I would like to say, 'Well, that's ridiculous.' By all means, Mayao Miyazaki gave the world a movie that's worth 100 viewings. And the achievement in the movie history already proved that. Check the IMDb plot keyword 'Epic', and you will know Princess Mononoke is not the best animation movie, but also one of the best saga created in modern technology. The story involves a warrior, Ashi-taka, who had to leave his remote village for the the middle Japan, after he killed the enraged Mountain Pig and was cursed by it. Experiencing all the pains from the curse, he can't help being involved into the triangle conflict between the forest, the cannon-manufacturing city and the samurai......The movie had its own mythology, in which the forest was protected by the ancient beasts who are now called 'gods' by other beings. The conflict between human being and the nature was a total war in every aspect. In the development, humans tried to destroy the habitant of the animals so they could derive all the necessary resources. The animals lead by their gods also tried their best to guard the frontier of the forest, killing as much human as they could. Does this sound familiar to you? I guess so because that's the very situation happening a thousand years ago and still happening now. The only difference is the nature only strikes at human in a larger scale in reality. So the movie is somehow unrealistic? No. Wait until the end to conclude. The whole script was so well thought out that every element, every single shot was legendary. You will remember the intense struggle to come to terms between Human and nature in both a symbolic way and a literature way. You will remember the holocaust created by human deeds. And, you will remember the visual style. Differentiated from all the other Miyazaki productions, Mononoke has an cutting-edge look that contains many bloody and gory scenes, decorated with the latest technology at its time. Though the technology it used didn't redefine the whole industry, it overwhelmed the whole movie industry, claiming the coming of an age that animation movies can carry great value like a real-set movie, and deserve more credits. Not after 6 years,an Academy Award for the best animated feature was delivered to Hayao Miyazaki, for his most famous production 'Spirited Away'. I believe without Miyazaki's effort, without the case of Princess Mononoke, we would never have such an award. 10/10. I still gave more credits to it than Wall-E.",10,0,1,20 February 2009
Valkyrie," A good examination on a bad management case.
","Valkyrie is good in casting, scale, tension building, technical and historical details and a lot of other things. But, what caught my thought, which the movie intended to, was its perspectives.There were a lot of 'hit on Hitler' movies I saw in the past, all of which seemed to present purely in the heroic view of the main protagonist, and provided audiences with more sentimental bases for those brave men. Those movies were great hero movies, but wasn't as reflective as Valkyrie.Valkyrie is a thriller told in many perspectives, none of which were melodramatic or overdone. The good thing about this presentation is that, we can evaluate the whole event as a management case. Using the basic management model taught in universities, we see there are a lot of holes in planning, organizing, leading and controlling of the operation. Basically, they needed to be more diligent to execute a plan as big as this. Tom Cruise gave a solid performance as the core manager Stauffenberg, who was a good soldier with a heart, but a bad assassin with too straight a mind. All the people involved in this high treason suffered from something similar. You just have to sigh for them that they could have gotten so many things more realistic. For instance, assassination on Hitler had to be double-checked, but wasn't. In order for the higher ranking officers and some certain army functions(telegraph centers) to take sides with them, they should at least have done more political works...... No need to mention the organization that kept falling apart.I personally refused to accept the idea that it's some kind of providence that kept Hitler from being assassinated for 15 times. Maybe it's the movie Valkyrie that gave me some new ideas. Suddenly, it came to me that Stauffenberg and his staff was noble enough to be remembered in history, but not dirty or tactful enough to overthrow the Nazi government. It's 70 years later now. Are we seeing the big pictures so we won't make the mistake? I wonder.",7,1,1,8 August 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Culture shock series: Law Abiding citizen.
","Before I go into the review, allow me to give you some facts about this movie on the other side of the earth. Firstly, it was among the highest ranking movies on popular Sino movie site Xunlei, with an incredible 9.8/10. Secondly, most Sino viewers actually think Clyde Shelton stands for goodness in this movie. Some of them even thought that he's the noblest martyr of his kind. Thirdly, the favorite scene considered by them and me was this one. The female judge was having an emergency meeting with lawyers Nick Rice and Jonas. When she got a phone call on her cell phone, the lawyers were startled by the fact that she's violating the law about no cell phones in the courthouse. She commented casually that the point of being a judge is she can do pretty much whatever she wants. The moment she picked up the call and put the phone to her ear, the phone exploded, and the tiny bomb blew her head open, killing her. Instantly, I burst into applause because it's too satisfying to see an injustice justice being punished by someone in the prison.Does this kind of judge exist in practice? I am afraid most of you would say, 'Definitely'. OK, do good judges exist then? Honestly, I am not sure. I don't have any hard evidence about any judges' compass, be them pointing north-north, or north-northwest. But, after I saw Clyde Shelton's story, I guess bad judges do exist, so do madmen like Shelton. My question now becomes, do badness and madness have bounds on the screen, or do I enjoy this madness and on screen bad deeds each time they go a bit crazier? My answer is a reluctant yes, thus I admitted my sins watching movies. The point is I now know there's a need, a call deep from my soul that it's better to stop enjoying such a movie experience. The moment Clyde Shelton claimed he's a 'Law Abiding Citizen', this term along with its original meaning in the USA constitution corrupted, since anyone who has seen this movie would unconsciously avoid using 'law abiding citizen' by expressing his respected citizenship. Of course, there are exceptions, especially we Sino people who have come to believe there was no ultimate good in the first place, and everything including the law is all relative depending on which social class you're in. While the Americans may be able to tell there are good judges and there are still goodness in the juristic system, we Sino people can't. That's because we Sino people don't believe so even before we see the movie.Even the American audiences can have some thrills watching it, actually. I've read on IMDb that a lot of people do think US jurisdiction system is faintly ill, which provided the hard facts as the justification of Shelton's rage. If one's rage can be justified, rationalized, then the next thing in line you need to nod to will be madness. Shelton wanted to see good in law, but actually he stocked more in revenge. His life was tore apart, yet he didn't know anything to seek beyond the law. If such a dramatic, tragic development of character is an art house rule, then Law Abiding Citizen the movie should be called a testimony for Split personality. I don't have a story in my life which is sadder than Shelton's, but if there's a chance I could talk to him, I'd say law cannot enforce itself. And, it's not a great discovery made by me or Columbus. It's just written in an old, ignored book, the Bible.Actually, I don't plan to persuade any Shelton to abandon his revenge and self-induced justice, neither does the Bible. See, laws are for humans to know their sins, not for them to capture any goodness. In fact, there's nothing humans can wield to capture the goodness. The law, the education, the marriage can all be inspiring goodness if one's soul still have some brightness. On the contrast, the law, the education and the marriage can also be ongoing disasters if one has decided to eliminate that remaining brightness in his soul. OK, the fact about humans is that the brightness in souls are always dying, so the only way to be redeemed from that direction is to repent and turn to Jesus Christ, who in the Bible, provided he has come not to abolish the law, on the contrast, he has come to fulfill the law with his love and spirit.Movies like Law Abiding Citizen didn't happen in the real world, but oops, that's only a half-truth. Mayhem on the screen was pushed to their most degraded, horrifying way, which more or less leaves a mark on audiences' souls. In the first place, it didn't happen physically, but then those who think they have immunity as a reasonable adult would find they will need to see something crazier to be satisfied next time. The not-so-convincing ending ensured the movie to be politically right, but still, comparing to the point the movie made with its disturbing illustration, such a political rightness is only a lie. You would think the Bible asked too much from you by calling you to reflect and repent, but compared to Law Abiding Citizen which urged you to question laws, moralities and goodness to the end, the Bible's much more forgiving.",8,2,5,24 October 2009
Up in the Air," The real tragedy?
","And yes. Up in the Air is one of the finest crafted motion picture of year 2009. If you have any interest in it, go check out Clooney, his big-time young apprentice and Vera Farmiga in this movie.No matter how much you try to take it as a comedy, it's essentially very sad in the undertone. And, after you know better and better how to write a proper satire, you'd know there's something fishy about Farmiga's character the moment you see her naked back. So, Up in the Air is not about revolutionary story structure, instead it's a good look at our daily miseries as we are more comfortable in calling them 'daily lives'.Clooney's character Ryan Bingham reminds me of his performances in Coen brothers' comedies as well as in more serious dramas like Michael Clayton. It's a magically charming character with very deep sense of exhaustion and sadness restrained, but with robotic professional attitude embedded. This mixed feeling of reality and its funny side is even deepened when his young apprentice/competitor Natalie(with a surprising performance from young actress Anna Kendrick) interacts with him. 'The man who's ready to make a connection' the tag-line will be realized as an ultimate irony once you finished the movie. That's because everyone Clooney met and made friends with in the movie eventually would be 'send off' by him(willingly or unwillingly). He makes emotional connections with people only because he's part of a mechanic that cuts undesirable ties when companies decided to do some laying off.If we try to double the irony and sadness in Juno and Thank You for Smoking, we would finally get something like Up in the Air. Except this one gives you more chills when you walk out of the theater. 'Do I deserve to be treated like a machine, a used one?' You may ask. Well, that's the question I often ask myself, but if you, like me, always have treat yourself as a dedicated working machine, then the answer is undoubtedly yes. The movie showed different mindsets of people dealing with families, goals in the life, etc......One scene that caught me was when Clooney attached the 'gnome pictures' he shot for his little sister to the USA map. That's when he realized there's something more valuable in the life he missed. While Ryan Bingham the 10-million-miles loyal flight passenger haven't got an option but had to fly on, I prayed for myself to have an option not to be like him. God bless America.",9,1,3,21 January 2010
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Definitely one of my favorite comedies.
","Wow, after 8 long years I finally have the chance to see the much hyped O Brother, Where are thou? . In my opinion this movie definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for the best picture. People may have different idea about the movie, especially those who are not familiar with American culture. But I liked it a lot, regardless of some jokes that I didn't get.It is said that the movie is loosely based on the epic poem 'Odyssey' by Homer, which I didn't believe in the first place. But after some moment, the movie become more and more convincing and disturbingly ironic. It really took me some time to realize that it's a political satire rather than some cheap comedy.The story begins with 3 prisoners escaped from a grave-digging field, and tried to escape to one's cousin's home. Later on, more and more irony happened like snowball running off the mountain. For 10 dollars they sang a DIY folk song along with a blue singer who supposedly sold his soul to the 'Devil' or whatever. And they hoorayed at the 10 dollars they made, knowing little about their future in the music career....The story, which has so much to tell, virtually involved so many recognizable historical moments in US. From the great depression to the KKK. In the eyes of the 3 prisoners, all the people around are crazy as hell, just like the messages they try to communicate in the epic poems.Besides, George Clooney again played a likable character.9/10",9,0,0,4 August 2008
