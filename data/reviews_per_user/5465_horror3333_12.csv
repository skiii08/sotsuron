Ghost," Humorous, intelligent, and overall moving.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS When I first heard of the movie Ghost, I really wasn't interested, mainly because I was about 7 or 8. May 2003, when I was 13, I saw this movie. I thought that it was one of the smartest, funniest, and touching movie I had ever seen. Patrick Swayze will always be recognized for his part as Sam, probably second behind Johnny from Dirty Dancing. He is one of those guys who tries to act all macho, but he is obviously sensitive and down to earth. His girlfriend is Molly, played by Demi Moore in an equally memorable performance. The most memorable performance, though, is that of Oda Mae Brown, played by Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg won a very deserving Oscar for Supporting Actress, as well as the same award at the Golden Globes. She is the psychic fraud who is able to communicate with Swayze, whose ghost refuses to move on to the next life. When he finds out that Molly is in great danger, him and Oda Mae team up to save her life, leading to an eye watering ending. For those of you who love this movie, 'Ditto!' 8/10",8,4,6,22 March 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Lots of Gore, Few Scares
","Dawn of the Dead. I thought it was gonna be much much better than it actually was. I loved the movie from the very beginning, but towards the middle it was ridiculously gory and there were hardly any scares. It was also quite boring at times, but it did have its great parts. SPOILER ALERT In the beggining when the little girl walks into the room and a huge chunk of skin on her face is missing, exposing blood and muscles, I got scared. Then she takes a huge chunk out of Ana's husband's neck. Blood spurts everywhere, and Ana throws the girl out of the room and locks the door. As the girl, whose name is Vivian actually, tries to bust in, Ana tries to save her husband. He dies as she calls 911, but soon comes back to life and tries to kill her. When she escapes, it's chaos outside; houses are burning, helicopters are flying above, and the dead have come back attacking people. That's all I will say. If you haven't seen it, maybe you should. It was just O.K. I give it a 7 out ot 10.",7,0,2,29 March 2004
Beauty and the Beast," The best Disney movie EVER
","This movie has been my favorite Disney movie since I was three years old. It is filled with humor, magic, suspense, and heart. It tells the story of a teenaged girl named Belle, whose father Maurice has been captured by a hideous beast, who is actually a selfish prince with a spell put on him. She makes a deal with the beast: The beast releases her father and takes her instead. She eventually warms his cold heart, and the two fall in love. But, a selfish man named Gaston, who has been in love with Belle, doesn't approve, and his plans almost prevail in an excellent climax. The title song 'Beauty and the Beast' performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson is classic. I would highly recommend this movie, even to adults, because it is sure to touch all who see it. 10/10.",10,5,5,17 February 2004
Spice World," The best movie EVER!...when I was seven years old.
","I was seven when 'Spice World' came out in 1997. I saw it in the theaters and thought that it was the best movie ever. I went out and got the soundtrack (which was also their second album) and listened to it non-stop. Then I bought the movie when it came out on video, and never stopped watching it. Looking back on it, I really can't believe that I liked this movie. I mean I don't think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's just really stupid. I remember when I was OBSSESSED with everything Spice: the music, the gum, the lollipops, the books, the movie, the posters, and yes, even the dolls. I think I still may have some of the dolls, and I'm sure they'll be worth lots of money (I know my Ginger Spice will be). Anyway, back to the movie. Practically everyone I knew went to go see the movie, and all of us like it. I think that most people hate it now because they are afraid to admit that they liked the Spice  Girls, or that they still do. I am not a fan anymore, but I have to listen to their music every now and then for memory's sake. I still even watch the stupid movie every now and then, also. It's all because of the good memories. 7/10.",Null,0,1,23 July 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," 'The Day After Tomorrow' can be summarized in one word: INTENSE
","(SPOILERS) This movie was very intense. When all of the weather changes start to happen, I actually started shaking. It was about global warming and a series of weather changes that eventually lead to the next Ice Age. I have to admit that I was also a little scared. The acting overall was great, but the special effects are what makes this film stand out. All of the weather changes looked so incredibly real that it was like actually looking at the real thing. There are some things that the movie could do without, like the girl's injury and especially the wolves. I liked how the movie went back and forth with scenarios of all the important characters and what is happening with the weather. Overall a great and intense film! 9 stars out of 10!",9,1,1,31 May 2004
American Pie," Hysterical sex comedy with lots of heart and soul...very rare.
","Unlike the film Porky's , American Pie is a sex comedy not only about sex, but also about true love. Most sex comedies deal with funny sexual encounters, but really have no meaning. This movie has funny sexual encounters, but all for the right reasons. There is true heart behind this movie, and that is hard to find in sex comedies. 9/10",9,0,1,6 February 2004
"I, Robot"," Trust me, it's better than it looks. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","I saw the trailer for I, Robot a few weeks ago and thought that it looked stupid. The special effects are what made me agree to see it with my father, and I have to say that I was very surprised. Within the first ten minutes or so, I was completely grabbed and wanted to see what was going to happen. As I predicted, the special effects were excellent, and the action scenes were well done, although I think they stole some ideas from The Matrix and other movies like that. Will Smith's character and James Cromwell's character are the most developed ones in the movie, but the acting was still good. Will Smith was always one of my favorite celebs, another thing that made me agree to see it. The film did have some ridiculous and corny parts, particularly when Will Smith's grandma wins the lottery. The ladies all seemed to love Smith's shirtless scenes, especially when he's in the shower and we see his full body. If you're a fan of action movies, I think you will like it. Even if you're not you still might like it. It was much better than it looked. 8/10.",Null,0,0,27 July 2004
Dirty Dancing," A definite classic, but not all the time
","Dirty Dancing is one of those films where you have to watch it if you're really REALLY in the mood to. It's a really good movie, but for some reason, it is not watchable all the time. I'm more into Flashdance and the Breakin' films. But, hey, that's just me. I give it and 8/10 rating.",9,0,1,2 February 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Not only a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece, a cinema masterpiece.
","(SPOILERS) A Clockwork Orange. One of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films, and certainly one of cinema's greatest films. It is the story of a pretty disturbed young man named Alex DeLarge, who enjoys ultraviolence, sex, gang rape...and Ludwig Van Beethoven. He spends most of his time hanging out with his cronies, who are all disturbed themselves. Each night they decide to have some fun, so they will either resort to a violent beating, rape (As Alex puts it, 'The Ole' In-Out, In-Out'), or both. They hang out at a bar, where spiked milk comes out of the nipples of naked female statues. One night, while Alex and his friends are wreaking havoc, Alex murders an old woman, and is sent to prison. Doctors decide to test a new formula on him, one which will cure him of his horrid habits. They inject him with a syrum, tie him to a chair with a straightjacket, prop his eyelids open with a clamping device, and expose him to horribly violent and sexual films. All of a sudden, he starts to feel a little queasy. His eyes are forced open, so he can't close them. The screen is too big for him to look away, so he has no choice but to watch these graphic films and get sick. Now that violence and sex nauseate Alex, he is released from prison...but when he attempts to kill himself, the government is blamed for what they did to him, and in the end, he is completely cured; violence and sex are again part of his life. This is definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, but there is something about it that draws you into it and makes you want to watch it. This movie is wonderful, but not for people who are easily offended. 8/10.",8,0,1,29 July 2004
Scream," Redefined the Horror/Thriller Genre
","Ok, when this movie came out I was six, and horror movies scared me. When I was eight, I loved horror movies. I really wasn't interested in seeing Scream, since it was new, and probably sucked. When we went to Wal-Mart (don't say anything!), I saw a copy and thought I might give it a shot. When It started, I was in the basement, which I used to think was the spookiest part of the house. My father was watching it with me, since we both love horror movies, and he hadn't seen it either.  SPOILER ALERT: TURN BACK NOW IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!!! Ok. It starts with the title Scream, and a woman's voice can be heard desperately screaming, probably for her life. A hand picks up the phone, and we realize that it is Drew Barrymore. At first she doesn't think much of it, since they get into a conversation about their favorite scary movies (he he he). He asks her if she has a boyfriend, and she replies no. Liar. Anyway, he asks for her name, and says that he wants to know who he's looking at. That is when she realizes that she is in trouble, and we as the audience wonder how she'll get out of it. Drew Barrymore is a major star, she can't get killed off! Wrong. It was very much like Hitchcock and Psycho, killing off Janet Leigh early in the movie. Well, a killing spree takes foot, and our hero, Sidney (Neve Campbell), is the main prey. When the killer (he he he) is revealed, the answer is mind blowing. The sequels were actually worth watching, and I want to get the box set. This genre defining film is an absolute MUST for any horror fan.  10/10.  PS: What are your favorite scary movies? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!",9,0,0,17 March 2004
Carrie," The best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.
","I wanted to see this movie when I was 10 (in 2000), but I wasn't allowed because of the nudity. Probably two years later I was allowed to watch it, and I thought that it was great. Sissy Spacek did a wonderful job as Carrie White, the typical tormented teenager...with mysterious powers she is just getting used to. Talk about puberty problems! Anyway, Piper Laurie just plain freaked me out. Her portrayal of Miss White, Carrie's mom, send chills down my spine. She was just so strange. I had read the book, and knew about the prom scene. I couldn't wait to see that part, and when it came on, I was like 'wow'. It was done brilliantly. The soundtrack to the movie was very wonderful (I just won a copy of the CD on eBay). I thought that it was actually better than 'The Shining'. 9/10",9,0,0,25 June 2004
Dodgeball," Hilarious, yet Ben Stiller wasn't the funniest thing.
","I just saw Dodgeball yesterday, and I thought it was great. All the acting was great, and there were plenty of great laughs. The thing that kind of surprised me, though, was that Ben Stiller wasn't the funniest thing; he wasn't even in the movie as much as I thought he would be. He was still great though. He also has buffed up much. The movie is about a man named Peter LeFleur (Vince Vaughn) who owns Average Joe's Gym. White Goodman (Ben Stiller) owns Globo Gym, a more popular gym right next door to Average Joe's. Stiller threatens to close Average Joe's, unless Peter can come up with $50,000 in 30 days. Peter decides to give up on trying, until one of the members of his gym suggests that they compete in the annual Dodgeball Competition, with a cash prize of, you guessed it, $50,000. A pretty laywer (Christine Taylor) decides to join their team, mainly because she hates White Goodman. Will Pete's team win, or will Globo Gym destroy them? Go see this hilarious movie and find out!  9/10.",9,0,0,4 July 2004
