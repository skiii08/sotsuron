Black Swan," Director's duo versus Natalie's trinity
","The first 30 minutes of the film is really well intended and constructed - a dark side of the beautiful reality. Following the camera work, elements poured into the shots I have been expecting very twisted plot, terrific acting and directing. Natalie Portman's role gets warm up quickly and is already in full shape in the characters build-up. It should have been a great movie.The trinity of Natalie Portman, Nina and Black Swan is a very interesting part and I'm not sure if this is the original idea of the director; if not, then he should thank Natalie Portman for being so intricate in herself and the character mix-up. She works very hard in that playing Nina as a great ballerina, just as hard as Nina trying to catch Black Swan spirit with her own White Swan blood. Pushing herself to the corner or the limit, Nina really gets no better way out to understand what Black Swan is actually about, though Thomas Leroy is using his 'cheap' way to seducing her thinking this would make her let go what she's possessing. Natalie Portman is comparatively under a much more difficult state of mind than Nina as she has to figure out how to transform herself into a perfect Nina who in turn is eager to find another ego in herself helping her to be in the role of Black Swan. The difficulties Natalie Portman faces is the plot actually doesn't provide enough build-up and space for her to understand such a complicated state and so she has to rely much on her own imagination about the role where the movie or the screen play hasn't provided yet. To be fair, Natalie Portman has saved the movie.It seems the director purposely trying to underline sex as the key point about Nina's let go. The way Thomas is speaking about Nina's deficiency in the play (the White Swan is perfect but the Black Swan isn't there) matches the director's underestimation of the character's intricacy, both are so simple in thinking and don't bother to give more thought into what Nina should be. If Thomas has let Nina work on her own how to find the Black Swan spirit, the director has left Natalie Portman alone in the movie struggling around the trinity relationship of herself, Nina & Black Swan. This sounds interesting enough though, as the duo of the director and Thomas versus the trinity of Natalie Portman, Nina and Black Swan succeeds in giving the movie a newer perspective which the audiences wouldn't have given much thought into it. Has it been an original idea of the director? I don't know but the movie really provides such an angle for me to look into it at least.The movie begins in a very artistic way but it lasts not more than 30 minutes. It could have become a really 'Dark' movie but it seems the director doesn't want it be that, so in the last 20 minutes he has turned the movie into a typical thriller. I particularly don't like the way Nina finishes off herself. She should have been really into Black Swan and ends up together with it. Now she's no more than a schizophrenic patient. It should have been more than that.",Null,1,2,10 March 2011
