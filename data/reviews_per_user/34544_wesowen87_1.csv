Scarface," definition of gangster movie
","I have seen this movie at least once a year, starting over 10 years ago for the first time. I'm a die-hard Scarface fan. This movie has held up through the years, and now at a quarter-century in age, it is considered a classic among gangster movies. Al Pacino plays a Cuban immigrant who comes to Miami with nothing, and becomes a drug lord, a king of an empire built on brick after brick of cocaine. Scarface was my idol as a teenager, like many troubled kids from bad cities. There are many popular phrases from this movie that are often quoted, and seem unforgettable to me. 'The world is yours' stuck out to me, and is seen repeatedly throughout the film. I don't see how this movie doesn't have 10.0 stars, it was flawless if you're into gangster flicks.",10,0,1,20 July 2008
