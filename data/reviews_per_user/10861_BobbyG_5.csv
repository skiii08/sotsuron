The Hangover," This is NOT a Good Movie!
","I heard from two people I know 'The Hangover' was an incredibly funny movie so when my girlfriend suggested we see it, I said OK. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I laughed, at most, 5-6 times. There were some truly offensive and very unfunny parts the crowded theater found hilarious. You have to be concerned about our society when this passes for entertainment. I'm sorry, but liberal use of the 'F' word does not make a scene humorous. I rate it a 5 because it is one of the many lame and average attempts at humor Hollywood has released over the years. The fact that it currently ranks at #130 of all time over the likes of Animal House and Something About Mary is truly puzzling.",5,7,15,15 June 2009
Fight Club," Point Could Have Been Made More Gently
","This is an interesting and unusual film with great acting, directing and production values.  Unfortunately, the film grows tiresome after the first few thrashings.  The message is a good one, but the delivery is a mess.  The sad thing is that lots of testosterone laced young ones will probably get the wrong idea and take the more brutal and sociopathic parts seriously and even model this behavior to some degree.  Can't the idea of rebelling against social brainwashing be made less violently?  There must be a gentler way to show that all we need is shelter, clothing and food...everything else is just filler and working twice as long as you have to to clutter up your life is madness...making a national past time of watching oversized men run into each other in a futile attempt to bring a ball across a line on a field is sheer lunacy.  A film that gets people to think is a great thing.  But there must be a better way to do that than this one does it.",8,0,1,8 October 2000
The Thing," Great Film Thrills
","I've seen this film about 3 times since I first viewed it at a drive-in back in 1982.  Although I don't find The Thing to be as scary as many who have provided their reviews here, the film is an excellent sci-fi thriller.  If you want scary, rent the original Psycho by Hitchcock. 
Carpenter made his masterpiece with this movie.  All the other films he has done have disappointed me on some level, but not this one.  The Thing has just the right amount of humour mixed with intensity that I prefer and enjoy.  Carpenter's other films usually have a campy quality that is hard to sit through.  The Thing has a few holes in the idea that could have been clarified a little more.  **Possible Spoilers** For instance, when the Thing imitates a human does the person's memory and personality become altered or obliterated.  None of the characters ever brought this up which kind of boggled my mind.  Also the proliferation of dynamite and flame throwers at the camp was a bit much.  It looks like they were geared up for some kind of alien invasion (maybe Saddam of the South).  All in all though, this is a great film which I give a rating of 10 to because of the great direction, music and special effects.",10,0,1,28 August 2002
The Revenant," Great Moving Film
","Reading several of the negative reviews of this great film made my blood boil. How dare you say this there is no character development? This is not a mini-series! There are time constraints and developing character generally takes more than three hours. God, you people can be awful, spoiled ingrates. This film brought me to tears during several scenes.Getting that off my chest, I will now provide my opinion of this incredible production; which was completed in less than one year. The Revenant is long at over 2 1/2 hours. And yes, it is a bit too long. Actually it is not, for those not marred by the instant gratification evidenced in modern society (you poor souls!). The cinematography and plot are so exceptional you won't notice the unusually long length.The initial scene involving the battle with the Indians is stunning in its chaos and unpredictability. The viewer doesn't know who will live and die and by what means. The battle lines are obscured to a degree not seen in may films I've viewed.The rest of the film is a long slog through nature in its extreme challenges and is moving. You may question the motivations and decisions of the subjects, but these are all conjecture by the director based on his interpretation of the true story.I will watch this film again with the closed capture enabled because I only understood about 80% of what was said. It will be worthwhile in my opinion because, in its essence, this film depicts the good and evil, along with the greed and selflessness, in every man.",9,1,3,15 February 2016
Don't Breathe," Don't Breath is a Conundrum
","Don't Breath starts out well with three morally challenged characters attempting to make their way through the world by burglarizing others homes. They decide to rob a blind war veteran (excellent character actor Stephen Lang) of his settlement from the wrongful death of his only daughter. It's not a bad movie, but at some point you wonder who to root for because the blind veteran (Lang) is concealing a despicable secret in his basement. The thrills are well filmed and fairly predictable. The scariest character in the film is Lang's rottweiler. Lang's blind character must have had sinus issues because he would walk next to unseen burglars and not smell them which I found unrealistic. Supposedly the other senses are heightened when one is missing. Maybe I'm off-base with this criticism. Sometimes I can't smell things due to allergies.I was hoping for more scares, but maybe I'm jaded from seeing so many horror movies over the years (I'm past middle age). If I had seen this in high school it would probably have been a totally different experience.The of ending of Don't Breath leaves room for a sequel, although maybe it would be hard for a blind man to track down a woman who robbed him.",6,3,7,29 August 2016
