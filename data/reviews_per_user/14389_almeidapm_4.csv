Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham kicks ass
","What a crazy twist to the history of Abraham Lincoln. While complete fantasy the movie has a very compelling story telling ability and loads of action at every turn.It gives you a possible different look at the civil war and why it really happened, while taking to a Vampire war for survival and Abraham's quest to clean the world of Vampires.Good cast, engaging storytelling and loads of action. Not an Oscar winning movie, but a great entertaining one.Exciting movie and tons of action, what more can you ask for from a vampire slaying movie?",7,2,4,14 October 2012
Coriolanus," Well Done
","Coriolanus is a 2011 British film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Coriolanus. The play is based on the life of the legendary Roman leader Caius Marcius Coriolanus.This is the directorial debut of Ralph Fiennes.This movie is a modern era adaptation of the old Rome, senate and its soldiers.Fiennes used modern day setting, of a city/country called Rome at war with a neighboring enemy. While the dialogue matches the 1608 Shakespeare novel, the settings are modern.This is without a doubt a great way to tell an ancient story in a modern setting while still keeping the original dialogue. It was refreshing to see such a movie, since it really made you appreciate the timeless aspect of the story and its characters without concerning yourself with set designs or wardrobes.This view of the play put all stock on the dialogue, characters and the story that was being told, instead of the bells and whistles that go with making a movie like this.Well made, well directed, and a great performance by Fiennes.",7,0,2,14 October 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Super Movie for a great Super Hero
","By far the best Spider Man movie ever made. This was what every other Spider Man was missing, great actors, gripping story and tons of action. The new Spider Man captures the true essence of the comic book, and delivers a story that could be taken from a comic book itself.Going forward i can't see another actor being used in the role of Spider Man, Andrew Garfield is the embodiment of Spider Man, and he deliver a super hero performance.If you are a fan of the comic book, or of action super hero movies, this one is a must see.Great Movie.",8,27,40,27 October 2012
Saints and Soldiers," Interesting movie
","his movie is based on real life events, which to me always makes for a better movie. It is a movie set in WWII but it isn't a war movie per say.It is a story of 5 man, and how they struggle behind enemy lines to survive and bring important information to the Allied forces. Guilt, anger and hate will change into understanding and faith, by not only their actions but the actions of the soldiers who they are fighting against.A well done movie with an interesting story, worth watching if you are a war movie fan.",6,0,2,20 October 2012
