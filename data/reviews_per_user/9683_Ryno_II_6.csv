The Rock," One of the best actions films ever!!!
","-MEDIOCRE SPOILERS-
The Rock is a true classic because it is so well written for a modern action movie.  The characters, the plot and the battles are all at the best they could be.  I did have a small problem with the ending.  The film's writers made up a 'truth' to a real-life historical conspiracy but the truth is never fully revealed in the movie.   The hero(Sean Connery) and the villain(Ed Harris) are told about very deeply.  The story reveals tragic events of there pasts that made them into very interesting characters.  The story itself is a lot better than the average 'kill the terrorists, save the hostages' scenario.  The movie has a lot of surprising turns, such as the villain turning good and saving innocent people from being killed by his own men, and then his own men kill him because of that.  The action sequences are fairly well planed and executed such as one of the most exciting car chases I've ever seen ripping through San Francisco, followed by an explosive assault on Alcatraz island.  The majority of audiences will probably agree that this was the best action movie of 1996. I rate this movie ****/****.",10,2,3,12 April 2004
Unbreakable," Possibly the best thriller I've seen!
","This is a story that is emotional, dramatic and somewhat mind blowing.  It's rare where the viewer would feel inside the minds of the characters as much as in this movie.  M. Night Shyamylan proves to be a very worthy writer once again after his huge success with 'The Sixth Sense'. However I found Unbreakable to be much more entertaining.  It's not as far fetched as the 'The Sixth Sense' and all the sides of the story seem to fit more and make more sense.  'The Sixth Sense' was a large moneymaker but I can't quite figure why Unbreakable didn't do near as well.  Perhaps nobody wanted a very similar type of such an unusual movie with the same actor.
I recently just saw a director's cut of 'Unbreakable' but I wouldn't recommend it.  There are scenes in it that add to the story but they also make it far fetched and too coincidental.  I'm glad these scenes were deleted, otherwise it would've been to over the top.",10,0,1,4 May 2004
Unbreakable," An excellent and twistful story
","A movie about Redemption and Justice.  Bruce Willis is the soul survivor of a deadly train wreck and Samuel L. Jackson plays the lifelong ill man who mentors him into becoming a super hero, believing in his theory of what fate has in store for him.  I loved this movie.  There is nothing I would change about it.  The writer M. Night Shamylan wrote it completly to my taste. I believed that it could have been more exciting in little action and suspense that it had, but otherwise I felt that this is the perfect movie.",10,0,1,22 April 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," The best of the trilogy.
","WARNING!  POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS!I've read reviews from critics and heard comments from friends about this Matrix film being the least pleasing of the three.  After thinking it over it became my personal favorite.  It does not have as much of a thinking plot as the other two besides the ending, however, I thought that it was the most emotional and dramatic story of the three and simply the most exciting.  I prefer an emotional story over a thinking one. This one kept my mind going the whole time.  I felt that the other two kind've dragged in few scenes. In this one the fight sequences between the humans and the agents were more realistic.  The previous film's fights were far fetched and pretty fake looking.  The special effects of zion and the sentinels were most undoubtedly the best!  After thinking it over, I give the two prequels both 8/10, and I give Revolutions 9/10.  I have high standards when it comes to movies and I found this masterpiece to be incredibly satisfying.",Null,0,0,25 March 2004
Die Hard," A very overrated action film.
","This movie is on this sites top 250 but I can't figure out why so many people like it. The problem simply is that John McClane makes one stupid decision after another.SPOILERS AHEADThe scene where Tony is looking for John and is obviously going to kill him with that submachine of his is the best example.John sneaks up behind Tony and presses his semi-auto against his head, then pistol whips and then fight him with his bare hands, instead of forcing him to relinquish the gun first. Tony then tries to shoot John. Any averagely smart cop would have shot Tony.Another example is the scene where John was trying to signal the cop, Al by breaking the window with the chair. A gunman comes into the room, but John is ready for him. With his pistol raised he tells the gunman to put his gun down. John has no back up or assistance to take restrain the guy so attempting to force the guy to surrender wouldn't be wise. Another gunman enters the room just after that, and because John chose not to shoot the first one who entered, that makes things a lot more challenging.And the third is, in the scene where John meets Hans, face to face for the first time. Hans is unarmed, and John has a gun pointed at him. They both hear the elevator arrive at the floor they're on, which of course means more henchmen are coming. For some reason John doesn't shoot Hans as the elevator doors begin to open. He shoots at the henchmen just as they are coming out out of elevator and runs. The mistake there was leaving Hans alive. I know the filmmakers wouldn't want the hero killing of the main villain early, but couldn't the writers come up with a scenario in which the hero couldn't kill the villain early? Couldn't they write a script that makes sense of the characters? The lieutenant who kept arguing with Al, never followed logic either. There was no reason why he would have any doubt that there are terrorist in the building. If he is that dumb then why is he that high promoted?",4,30,83,15 February 2005
Blade Runner," I think it's very overrated.
","The movie is heavy on images and special effects, and Ridley Scott really knows how to create a Sci-Fi universe, but there ins't much of a story or substance. Therefore, one similar type of movie I'd like to compare this to is The Crow.The Crow, which I thought was a pretty good movie, also is heavy on visuals and action and nothing else. However, The Crow was all wall to wall with action scenarios. It's filmmakers knew they were making a film without much story and just an idea. Where as the filmmakers of Blade Runner gave this movie a lot of meaningless dialogue and other little things which should have been plot points but weren't really.There are two solutions the writers could have done. One is two rethink the entire movie and come up with a lot more plot and fill in the long empty gaps that the movie already has in between the action scenes. The next is if they couldn't think of much plot for there idea, just give the story a lot more continuous action or something stylish happening, like in The Crow. That's what kept The Crow going, and in that audiences don't look for anything else.",5,6,15,15 June 2005
