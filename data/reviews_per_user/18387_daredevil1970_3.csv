The Avengers," DC Comics Rule??? UHM!
","I am a DC Comics Fanatic; however, after watching 'THE AVENGERS' movie, I am seriously considering switching sides. I got to experience this movie in Matamoros, Mexico. It is oddly strange that the movie opened a week early in different parts of the world. It should have opened first in the USA before anywhere else. To top it off, I only paid around $6.50 to experience the movie in 3D and inside an IMAX Theater. Here in the US tickets will cost around $12.25 in a regular theater.'The Avengers' exceeded all my expectations of any 'Superheroes' movie. It is a movie full of action from beginning to end. This movie is very close to the animated movie 'THE AVENGERS', but with a very pleasant twist since the acting and the filming was believable. It is hard for me to choose who my favorite actor was. All of them did an incredible job performing their part. I do have to mention that even though the 'HULK' was computer animated (CGI), it was a breath of 'fresh air' to see him in this movie. He was funny at times and also very real looking.",9,13,26,28 April 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," Surprices???
","Ever since I started watching the 'X-men' on television, I became very fascinated on their story line and what the X-men represent.The first two movies introduced all the characters and their lives & troubles. For some reason, I feel movie makers did not concentrate on the characters in depth. This movie is very fast passed. The movie has too many story lines to follow and does not concentrate on one character.To be quite honest, I was a disappointed on the story line. I was expecting a better story line. I did not appreciate the way they got rid of some characters. Yes, the movie does possess a lot of advantages in special effects, but lacks the compassion that created the X-men.",8,0,0,2 June 2006
X2: X-Men United," Incredible
","If the first movie was good, this is definitelly ten times better.  In this movie, there is little time wasted in introducing the characters.  In the contrary, as soon as the movie starts it is full of action and aventure.  On top of all the action, there are quite a few of surprices.  Over all, it is awesome.....",8,0,0,1 May 2003
