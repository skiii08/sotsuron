Insidious: Chapter 2," epic suspense and thriller
","This movie is really a very nice. Though it was a low budget movie there was a great sense of thriller and suspense in the movie. there were about 3 mysteries which combined into one good story. The acting was awesome and one could easily get scared by seeing the movie. Insidious chapter 2 is the perfect name given to this sequel. It directly starts from the exact point from where the 1st movie actually ended. My friends came over to watch this movie at my house and they got seriously scared. There was a bit of confusion while seeing the movie but as the end came near everything became clear and everyone was satisfied. If some one really wants to get scared, I recommend them this movie. But they must also see the first installment or the movie does not even makes sense. After seeing the first part 'insidious' i was scared and happy and i also waited for the 2nd installment. After I watched the 2nd installment i felt that it was one of the best horror sequels ever watched. I also realised that this movie was far better than the insidious. If you have seen insidious and really want to get scared in the theatres then i highly recommend u this movie!!!",8,0,0,14 December 2013
