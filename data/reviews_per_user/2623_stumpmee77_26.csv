Marie Antoinette," Coppola's History Epic Crappola.
","How about SOME historical accuracy, dearie? If this film had been limited to those portions possessing Marie Antoinette's character & events in her life, the repetitive sequences reduce to 2 occurrences, its time length would be 45 minutes max. At the length and the material Coppola bestows, it would be tragic showing this to students saying it provides a better understanding of the French Revolution. Heck no it doesn't! What was she & the scriptwriters of this rubbish thinking??? Sofia's warping history is inexcusable as all she had to do was access the Internet or open a book about her subject for longer than a second.The largest chunk of historical accuracy takes place prior to her meeting her husband. Beyond thatOther than those time-gulping levees, more significant events in her life & aspects of her character crops up here & there, more often than not their durations so fleeting, this French Revolution aficionado was outraged. Just ONE scene she's mocking older peopleDauphine & Queen, she antagonized Versallies' old guard with this behavior. A brief scene she attends a masked ball. Instead after the soon grating levee, I'm treated to overly long sequences of gambling, shopping, gulping down pastries--& where did Coppola learn Marie Antoinette ate that much food & Poligiac (sp) snorted coke? Perhaps the coke snorter was Lamballe; really couldn't distinguish one from the other. All this divinely packaged fluff Sofia throws in is at the expense of the feather-brained, tragic queen's true story. Having primary filming done at the real Versallies does not an authentic Marie Antoinette film make. The Dauphine vs. Du Barry portion arrives suddenly & in the wrong portion of her time-lineIt's one of Marie Antoinette's first slip-ups after marrying Louis. Lambelle & Poligac (sp) are cameos. There's a scene lasting two minute tops mentioning those pamphlets running down her reputation--The fluff over those scandal stirring hand-outs that were a major contributor in pulling down the monarchy. There's 2 long scenes of Louis discussing the American Revolution with advisers but its never emphasized the cost the Monarchy paid for offering aid to the Americans. 4 me, this 2006 version's worst deviation IS Louis XVICould NOT get past the manner Coppola packages him. Throughout the film there's no powdered wig, remains tanned & relatively club med trimWhat in the name of God??? There's not the slightest effort taken to align his appearance with 18th century paintings or coins. The bulky actor playing Fersen or the one playing her brother given make up to appear youthful would make slightly better choices.Kirsten Dunst in the title role is goodbut enjoying her acting is sidelined by the gross historical inaccuracies and even grosser soundtrack. Only modern song I liked is 'I Love Candy.' Modern Marie Antoinette's soundtrack puts me in mind of a Knight's Tale. BTW, Knight's Tale appeals to me now as that's obviously a satire.Compared 1938's Shearer vehicle, 2006's tackling the Diamond necklace affair is horrendously minuscule. The earlier film's changing of Rohan from a priest reflects how priests were held in higher regard in the 1930sbut it's also the major change the earlier movie makes in detailing that turning point in Marie Antoinette' fortunes. New film, hm, recall 3 short scenes but don't recall the lines uttered by anyone in their being lackluster. From what is publicly known of her relations with Fersen, Marie Antoinette 2006's treatment was nothing less than jaw-dropping improbable. She would not risk everything sleeping with the man as debates would arise over the legitimacy of her children. A great mother, Marie Antoinette would not endure seeing her children harmed.The approaching revolution, like the Du Barry incident, is treated with little substance. The disgruntled peasants at last show up to storm Versallies. Where were the poor heretofore in this junk? But for all the inaccurate Louis, the protracted levee, the lavishness trappings is that incomplete,silly ending! Okay Sofia, you don't want to go into Marie's sufferings but... There should have been an epilogue prior to the credits detailing what happened to her. And some one tell me why else Sofia stopped the movie where she did other than running over movie's budget due to paying rent to film in Versailles, clothes, cake",1,30,46,8 September 2008
Citizen Kane," Unmatched
","This is my favorite film. Biblical flicks are in a category all its own.It's screenplay uses elements from every movie genre except sci-fi as its reaching beyond imagination. But in terms of imagery it takes a little bit of everything. The beginning plays as an early Hollywood horror story; darkness, fog; the later Hitchcock film Psycho brings to mind Kane's castle 'Xandu' it's featureless house, other than its dark shape, looming in the moonlight. Don't touch it's cinematography; it'd be akin to making Gone With the Wind black and white.The ending left me a pleasant mishmash of emotions. It's a deliciously fragmented piece the outer manifestation of the story telling, Susan's obsession with puzzles and the gradual corruption of Kane's personality is pieced together by those he came in contact with. Neither are finished--but that's the the aspect of this masterpiece that sets it apart; Welles keeps his characters unperceptive of what made him tick. In his divulging the film's nagging question, Welles concludes its ending opposite of the style he had employed throughout--successfully drawing the 'Rosebud' mystery away from the compilation of putting together by the characters then waving the answer in front his face--It's impact upon me was a jumble, none of it 'lame': bowled over how the answer had indeed been provided albeit fleeting much earlier. It's a touch of sadness; for the reporter's quest remaining unsolved and those in contact with Kane never understood him. He was an enigma.Between creepy beginning and mind-blowing ending, poignant, touches of comedy, those in Kane's life (especially promoting his 'singing' second wife) and the title character's slide; from champion of the people to absorption of his infallibility.Concerned over repeating myself and not describing it to the digress I want without spoiling it, I'm closing it by recommending While watching it (and please watch it; it'd be worth one's while) Keep those reminiscing about Kane as separate puzzle pieces while watching.",10,7,9,20 June 2009
Alien: Resurrection," Have 1, 2, 3--I'll never get Alien 4
","3 is very depressing but it was fairly well written and realistic. Poor Ripley had to contend with the usual evil alien in and out belly and alongside that the possibility a prisoner could rape or kill her. What held my attention--How was Ripley going to get out. Well, she got out her predicament--Not in the way I would wish but it made sense.Nothing in Alien part 4 makes sense. I've seen it only once and that was more than enough. Events taking place 100 plus years later doesn't explain how they successfully merged two vastly different species, one that is especially lethal to the other, without some method; one is never provided mentioned how this was done. The internal confusion that usually crops up when a cloned character is in a plot isn't hashed out not one second--and if one movie needed it to happen was this one. Other than the basketball scene Ripley space reptile is completely unwatchable, not one shred of her human side and I was incessantly confused whose side she's on--found nothing positive about her nor those characters surrounding her. There's plenty to nauseate, though, the octopus derived mutations, the tedium of slow or still imagery and the swathed in bubble wrap Jabba the Hutt calling itself a 'baby'.",1,3,6,3 May 2009
Troy," Haaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaa!
","The Trojan Horse looked like it was put together by matchsticks and spit--And no one in Troy could see there were people moving in there? Look straight at the horse and you can see it.Paris--Sorry not my choice. If they wanted to get someone from LOTR they should've got the guy who played Aragon; it would've been more convincing. I found I liked Helen, I've always envisioned her to be either super vain or a super wuss. She was done from a new angle scared and full of foresight over what her husband was going to do and practical minded (well except for loving wussy Paris).Making a name. Are lots of kids around today named Achilles? I've known a couple of Hectors.Oh Hector. For my money, he was to the one to watch and sympathize. Most the time 'Achilles' was on screen I focused on one thing: that perpetually pouting mouth. He pouts in nearly every scene--look. His best scene is the part where he and Briseis do the wild thing--(it was also predictable, the whole events surrounding them build up towards that)--Looked pretty real to me!",Null,0,2,27 February 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," This movie was too feel good.
","I went to this film when it first came out thinking it was going to be 'The Day After' regarding the subject of Global warming and all it wound up being was a too cutesy-poo disaster flick. This should have had a lot grimmer ending. ID4's 'ahhh, the danger's pretty much is over and all's well that ends well' ending was more plausible considering the circumstances in that particular film. The way the TDAT's movie makers depicted it, Earth was going to go through wild changes including the LONG TERM ice age due to the results of global warming--We aren't provided with long term, this thing lasts seemingly for a matter of days and did not spread beyond America and the Britain--the ending was whacked as the peril was abandoned completely when were led to believe over and over these people would have to endure this final meteorological cataclysm (sp)--Couldn't the writers imply the cessation was a brief respite, that the ice age would resume sooner than later instead of what we got, all sunshine bliss and happy faces? If I had had my way, it would have ended with another storm on the radar.",4,0,2,26 May 2005
Cloverfield," I'll wait until it's slapped on the Sci-Fi channel or rent DVD
","Saw the trailer all 4 times (TF2007), was intrigued but also a tad dizzy & sick to the stomach. Just ended watching film clips on a certain website where all sorts video stuff can be uploaded to. Was hedging going @ the theater impulse; hideous monster giving me nightmares &/or it'd be too gory. The trailer was delightfully intense; thought would lean towards gross. Had a dandy premise, too. I gave it the score I did was the approach to THE MONSTER in plot line.Now won't be viewing this in it's entirety in a theater as I'll be afraid I'll faint immediately standing up. It's biggest most implacable gripe I've got w/ Cloverfield; camera is continuously moving: slow, fast spinning, swaying boat all that and more-somebody make this stop!! Can any 'citizen' snap still shots from their digi-cams? Given the naturally ensuing chaos, does Cloverfield's core group fall while running, hold the camera steady? Read reviewers mentioning BWP in describing it; 2 my mind 'Beast of Bray Road' viewed that malarkey recently on the Sci-Fi Channel. I repeat what I said there, why can't focus be off these Ford Agency models for just 5 minutes? There ARE people in the Big Apple who never set foot in a health spa, above or underneath 20 something. ID4 had more variety in terms of human characters. The human character spoilers for this, girl/boy severed relationship, regrets it and gotta save the ex-beloved couple action crap seen in many a Sci-Fi'original' flick. Instead of refugees from from a magazine, why not from the viewpoint of little ones, parents, monster's arrival interrupts the a get together of kids? How about putting it in a city OTHER than Mahanttan--how 'bout actually in a cloverfield, or the creature looking like a walking cloverfield for pity sakes? I've begun liking Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds'.Will close by speaking only in terms of the monster's (Not that of his spider/crab buddies--only reason I wanna rent 'Clover' on video.) rampage; less scary than Zok, the laser ray dragon, of the 1967-69 Herculoids TV series. Half an hr., Zok would've laid Manhattan waste. Now square-off between those two WOULD be interesting, also predictable, come think of it, I see who'd win a Cloverfield mile:Zok.",4,11,22,21 January 2008
Gettysburg," I didn't mind the length.
","Its length not for everyone hence I recommend watching it in increments as opposed to me who can watch it in its entirety, hardly tearing myself away from it, in one afternoon. Events inside those three days would be poorly depicted if they did less an hour for each one. The length of this film is for a reason.The reasons I love 'Gettysburg' includes but nowhere limited to: 1) It goes by the days and is very authentic in terms of detail of encampments and technology of the opposing sides. Many cast members' make-up is so good as to make that actor unrecognizable. The best example in terms of the actor made unrecognizable by makeup is Tom Berrenger as Longstreet. Martin Sheen I can still recognize despite his add-ons to make him look like R.E. Lee but he more than makes up in his portrayal of that pivotal general. I don't know if I'll ever be able to accept another actor as General Lee but Martin Sheen; he's that riveting.2) Its action flows with the day to day pulse of a soldier's life; both eventful and not. To describe it I'll paraphrase a quote from portion of the Ken Burns documentary of same Civil War (forget the particular episode): 'There were times of great tedium between moments of extreme terror.' No 2 scenes captures the 'terror' better in 'Gettysburg' than Chamberlain's army's defending their section on Day 2 and Pickett's Charge.3) As opposed to other historical films there's very little Hollywood distorting of history. As far as I see, except for J.L.Chamberlain's character,none of the rest of the major roles receives no major Hollywood rewrite. The real J. L. Chamberlain was fighting mostly for the union preservation, not for the slaves freedom but as the writers needed someone to bring the slavery was wrong angle so they picked his character. While the change to Chamberlain is inaccurate, I can see why it was done. Indeed I became interest in Chamberlain's life because of Ken Burns' Civil War documentary and this film.4) The Hancock/Armistead sad, ironic subplot is poignantly underplayed and in terms of the situation is historically accurate.5) I think it includes plenty of refreshingly funny moments to alleviate any possible heavy-handedness: Tom Chamberlain's chat with the confederate POVs; The Chamberlain Brothers' interacting in the film's first hour; the government guy from Virginia talking to the British visitor about State's Rights. I give the highest comedy commendations to Pickett in every scene before his charge, General Trimble talking to Lee about another officer the former felt was incomptent. I don't know why to this day but Sam Elliot's 1st 5 minutes as Bufford just cracks me up; it just does.Finally I would be remiss if I didn't mention this film's excellent movie score as one of the best I've seen in any war film.",9,1,1,4 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Calling Mr. Rogers...and making rasberrries!
","1)Can you say it's a stinker?2)Can you say CG's will never replace acting, there was real acting from real actors in 4, 5, 6 why was it not put in here? 3)Can you say this barfarino love story and could have been lopped out this film--AND it wouldn't have been missed? What little film carrying there was done by Ewan McGregor(sp), Samuel L. Jackson AND YODA'S 5 MINUTE SWORD BATTLE? 4) Can you say big wig Lucas ought to re-edit it and put it out again with the deleted scenes added back in, including the ones with Bail Organa? I can say I made one of the biggest mistakes of spending a Movie afternoon in my life when I chose this movie over Scooby-Doo 1!I can say Jar-Jar Binks' acting in TPM was more convincing in both films than the love story menacing this one.I can say I think the only clear reason why someone was trying to kill Padme was that was the means for Anakin to come back in her life so he could develop the hots for her navel!

Fargo," Great Story--Yaah
","It's Hawaii 5-0 meets a blizzard and women's lib! I absolutely love Marge and Norm--their relationship is the excellent counterpoint to the Lundegaard family and a lot of American movies of the last 2 decades. America needs more films depicting couples such as the former.It's one of the few dark comedy movies I really like in that it doesn't make a mockery of the the fact of what happens to its victims but goes to other angles for the laughs--mostly the reactions of the ones discovering the bodies, the occasionally high-strung 'funny looking guy' criminal helping Jerry, the accents and the food. It's MHO that one who doesn't have an appetite before turning on this movie regain it within the first 45 minutes and especially after the scene of Marge in the restaurant.What wasn't funny was Grimsrud--indeed I found him to be one of the scariest characters in recent movie history.Who was absolutely adorable was police-person Marge, smart sweet and 'connecting' all things together.",9,0,1,13 March 2007
Pitch Black," Have seen other films with the same scenario, so what sets this film apart:
","Not in order The crash landing...I see where Star Wars Ep.3 garnered inspiration from. The blood thirsty creatures. Cleverly displayed dark and fleeting; there's 3 scenes I saw them in detail. I still debate which species is worse the 1979 Alien or these guys...still can't decide. Anywhoo I love their deceptively sweet whale-esquire sounds and how relentless and by and large unstoppable.The Characters: My favorites (in order) Fry, Jack, the leader of the New Mecca pilgrims then Riddick. My one trouble with the film and I had this with Chronicles of Riddick--Most the time I don't understand what Diesel is saying first hearing his lines; I have to listen at least three times. But that's just me--He's the funniest one in the film. Except for 2 of them (both a bit overly depended on controlled substances), I was sad when they were offed.Now number 1 The whole eclipse sequence and the rise of the beast. Wow! Especially the eclipse--I've keep going back on it beginning to end.",9,3,4,27 May 2009
Doctor Zhivago," Great on the senses!
","Blue skies, yellow daffodils, lovely sets and clothes--AND OMAR SHARIF IN HIS HOTTY HEYDAY! Loved him better in 'Lawrence of Arabia' but this story is a close second. His acting rocks, especially the part where the cossacks are 'keeping order' and the camera only stays on his face grimacing and angry and later when he almost nukes against the authorities trying to shoo him off. I submit he didn't really like the brutalities of Tsarist Russia anymore than he did the intrusiveness of the communist.However, on the down side of the character and of the story itself is the hero having pregnant wife one place and lover somewhere else. The heck! But without that he wouldn't be a human being and he does get torn up about it so I guess that adds character complexity and humanity. On the other hand, while Rod Steiger is good as the villainous Komarovsky (sp), he comes off as the devil incarnate--is there a good side in this man? He even let Zhivago and Lara's daughter be lost!I'd be remiss to omit that the Soundtrack (not just 'Lara's theme') is my second favorite of all time.",9,3,4,10 January 2005
The Shining," Niiice Kubrick!
","The Exorcist never scared me the way this film still does. Exorcist has the lower lighting and creepy sounds littering the soundtrack from the get go. Save for the ominous opening music the Shining starts out with bright colors and open spaces then gradually closes in like the ghosts tormenting the Overlook and particularly its newest caretaker.This earlier adaption has noise and shadows and brings home again and again the sense of peril of isolation--The hedge and after that the mountains then the snow. There's the one scene where Danny escapes out the window and I'm holding my breath; if the kid were to sink in it he'd be dead in in an instant.There's a heap of of others too. Nicholson suddenly kissing the ghost (corpse?) and the briefest of shots of old hag form rising out the water. The twins girls at their hall of death and the blood coming around the corner. Danny's silent scream as Halloran is murdered before his psychic eyes.That probably 30 second shot of Jack Torrence dead in the snow is in my opinion the most banal but terrifying moments in horror movie history. I've watched this version of the Shining many times having owned the film and I still wind up shying away from this image.Sight, sound, a group of actors who could pull me in to the mounting terror going on and how desperate times are and one has to do to survive (Shelly Duvally & Danny Lloyd). In that Kubrick far and away exceeding the later version. In less than three hours he made me very, very scared.",9,0,2,13 February 2005
Independence Day," Those ships and a Black Man saves the world!
","Whoooo--and it helped they had one of my fave actors to watch anytime--Brent Spiner! This film rocks from start to finish, doesn't lag, scares in some spots, saddens in others. It has the feel not so much as a sci-fic film as as a disaster flick from the early to mid seventies so I suspended many of the improbablilities (like some nuke fallout ruining the landscape)--Who cares. I walked away from this feeling good! This film made me a Will Smith fan--in the Sci fi genre he's third behind the above mentioned Spiner, behind Spiner is Bill Pullman (also became a fan of his watching this film). I've never watched 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air', didn't care for Will Smith's singing. This film made me sit up and take notice of him.His Character popping the Alien: Welcome to Earth!

Gone with the Wind," Sanitizing GWTW's content for filming a GOOD choice.
","Between the release of 'Birth of A Nation' and 'GWTW--the Film' 25 years had passed. After 'GWTW--the Film', 26 more years would pass before the Civil Rights Movement rose to prominence in the U.S.Just why do I bring this up, you the reader asks? 'Birth of a Nation' started the Hollywood Civil Rights Movement (and yes it still has a long way to go) as it sparked outrage in the civil rights groups of 1914. Selznick's removing overall content in terms of blacks from the movie's screenplay was a deliberate act. I have little doubt had he let it stand, no small controversy would've flared in parts of the U.S. It had to be exorcised & the same approach would have to be administered if a remake were produced in the future.I read the book three times, some passages multiple times. None of the passages I re-read involved Mitchell's descriptions, viewpoints regarding white planter-class southerners & blacks. Talk about wanting to barf--Benevolent, humane approach to Southern slave-owners interacting with their 'negroes' conveyed as regular thing, the unbalanced depiction of brutality meted on the white south in as opposed to sanitizing of slavery. Regarding race relations, the aspect Mitchell's book pointed out without bias that the Yankees were no better than the South in their viewpoint of blacks as children. Although the n word appears sporadically, GWTW the book is the most racist book I've ever read and I took it out my library.Regarless of the Hollywood depicting the books racist aspects at a higher degree or not, still hope I'm not alive to see a remake.GWTW it's a good film both technically & the script rewrites makes lots of sense. The beautiful Technicolor, and the even more beautiful 'Tara's theme' rises my grading it to 5.The abridgments in the script rises my score to a 7 for the sensible changes. Scarlett's character is the biggest example, yes, even more than the blacks. Other than her adhering to promises once she gives them and that unshakable determination, Scarlett's book persona isn't likable: finds children generally annoying for a majority of the story, irrational (Ashley), and of course, her selfishness. Women, lots of them moms, coming to watch Gable would have had a problem seeing the real kid contemptuous Scarlett on screen. Another good example of efforts of removing racist elements, no mention of the KKK's 'righteous cause'--indeed no mention to the Klan by name at all.There's a lot of excellent moments, scary moments, and above all that great cast. I think it's safe to say this movies' remake is in the far future as no major actress today could match Vivian Leigh's Scarlet. None of them. There are a small list for Melanie Hamilton. I just don't want to look at another person to play Rhett--Clark Gable is hot! Hattie McDaniel IS Mammy. The one flaw I can see in the cast major and minor character is Ashley. I'm talking physically here. Leslie Howard is too old. Leslie Howard knew he was too old but Selznick gave him an incentive and so he played Ashley. He did well with the role in terms of accuracy but looked at most twice Ashley's age (I always thought the novel's Ashley was in his mid twenties at most). Watch it for the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, try ignoring the traces racism of here and there. If one still detests this movie's bigotry to African-Americans, a word of advice: Read the book, especially the post reconstruction parts.",7,2,6,11 March 2008

Patton," Own this classic war biopic; deliberately avoiding detailing it
","The war action itself the film puts at a lower premium while it plays up the organization of tactics and speeches and human conflict inside and of course outside the warring parties. In the realm this film shines. What could've been maxi snooze--it's talking by and large over battles is instead both gritty and funny. It contains of lot of standard war film characters and ups the quality of even those having less screen time than its stars. I've yet to find a war film funny while retaining the rather somber theme.This all can be attributed to the pleasantly off-beat screenplay and of that big course that is George C. Scott's complex, more than occasionally hysterically funny performance as the title character. I feel one deposit his Patton in a different backdrop and improve an if the event is a mediocre piece and improve its overall quality. May the Hollywood community never get in its head to remake of this film.",9,2,2,4 October 2008
Transformers," Way, way better than the 1986 film!!!!
","I don't even remember most of that piece of drek after my favorite character brought the scrapheap! This is super memorable: I'm going to ask for this video if it's out by Christmas.First of all I'm going to talk about Prime in this film. Defintantly the good: George Clooney (one of the choices for his voice)? I don't think so! Reason number 1 I wanted to see this film is being a fan gal smitten by Prime's original voice since 84. Thank you Mr. Bay; I was considering boycotting it if they had picked anyone else. Cullen conveys such charm and conviction. Like a few people have said the first moment he meets Sam was one of this movie's most moving scenes. Had to hold back tears. Now the bad: Could live with the new truck design, flames and all but why, why, why the designers have to give him such a butt ugly mouth? I was hoping that Megatron would pummel it and he would've had to hide behind the face mask permanently. Bumblebee the good: Loved his noble character, the cryptic way he was revealed in the first portion and was totally was enthralled by his devotion to Sam and Mikela, too in a lesser degree. The bad: beautiful as a Camaro--Butt ugly face when he transformed. Yuck! And thank you, Mr. Bay for improving that speech thing near the end, I found his 'problem' highly annoying in some places as I couldn't hear him clearly.The remaining Autobots did have more development than I anticipated while the Decepticons save Megatron and the sneaky, vicious Frenzy have no development other than being destructive. I couldn't discern which of them attacked the base. And Starscream just needed to get way more treacherous with Megatron (the later is a monster incarnate in this film); even the one scene where they did interact with each other for me was not enough. In fact it was the thing that irked me the most about this film which makes me give it a 9. Put that in the sequel please, Mr. Bay if you read this, I am begging you.I found Sam Mikela thing flat-out annoying in its predictably but it was made up by the writers making it integral to the plot and the true chemistry and acting of these principals. And I found Mikela's character way more interesting than providing cheesecake to the males in the audience.Now last but not least the action--all of it was off the chart but my absolute faves was Prime and (sorry I can't recall the Decipticon's name) fighting on the highway and of course the too brief battle of Prime and Megatron where I heard one of my favorite OP catchphrases: 'It's just you and me, Megatron.' Mr. Bay could you please bring on the sequel early, expand on all the Decepticons, not have Prime or too many Autobots buying the scrapheap and keep the voice of Prime you've got.",9,1,3,4 July 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not impressed, folks, not impressed!
","Too many add-ons to the Wonka background and distortions of the Wonka character. Yep, the 1971 version of Willy Wonka was the book's Wonka. Just like in the book, nothing was known about the great candy man's background other than his being betrayed by his fellow candy makers and his finding the oompa loompas. Where, why did Burton cook up these pace slowing flashbacks with the warped daddy, drawn out decision making of Charlie and that ludicrous ending? Why did Burton once again put Depp as the star? Not only I'm getting tired of seeing this happening but there doesn't look like there was any credence to them as professionals for doing so. I can think of at least three other stars who could have made the character come off funny with the lines given--Not Depp it just doesn't work. It's the worse case of miscasting I've seen this year.As others have said neither does the acting of the parents of these other kids work. There's no hysteria when these bratty children are harmed. The change in what happened to Veruca is not fit for sensitive children and seeing them at the end--well besides the garbage looking fake to me, it didn't appear they had learned from the ordeal. I learned something; not to recommend this claptrap to anyone.The only reason to see this film is the boy who plays 'way too saintly' Charlie.",2,0,1,24 October 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," The movie's monkeys were scratching their heads for ticks and fleas while I was scratching my head saying:
","WHAT? Huh? What? Dawn of Man Crap--I don't come from monkeys who were men in suits by the way--Look how one touches the monolith--it's a dead giveaway. Approximinately twenty minutes of meaningless chimp crap which includes see monkey learn about killing something and ooh ooh freaked out simian excitement over black slab. One of the awesome moments in the early part of this film is the switch over to the future and then we're back in snooze-ville. Ship taxi-es in, music--Sit upright during this portion folks otherwise you'll be put to sleep. Thanks to the chimps and the ships and the murmured babble about another slab--ooh a breath of a plot at last--With all this bogging down the pacing, It's well into an hour before the film reaches the best, and sad to say, shortest segment. Bowman, Poole and HAL, who after Star Trek the Next Generation's Mr. Data's got to be the sexiest voice of anyone pretending to be a mechanized being in the history of movies. HAL's also the most heinous of them all and due to his actions the film's most chilling moments take place. Then and only then Kubrick whips up the pace while and injects horror film imagery and incidents via creepy HAL.'Beyond the infinite' is the right title for the last segment. It's a real--belief suspender. I figured this out after watching this film a second time (I was a teen the first and did not past the rotating space station before giving up) There's only one way to get through the probe into the slab--Imagine you're getting into a car for a leisurely HALF HOUR(or so it felt to me; actually I think the running time is about 7 minutes) drive. Then after Bowman parks, dumping me into--Huh what's with sanitized hotel room? What's with the big Cute baby. Movie over. What was all that about? Visually a knockout, the plot, a tick picked out and tossed away by a chimp. I see some of the elements from Kubrick's later (and IMO) greater work, 'The Shining'--vast scenery and atmospheric lighting and effective use of classical music but that's all 2001 is. It just exists and does nothingzzzzzzz....",4,2,10,14 February 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Im-mo-bi-li-are-reeee!
","I heard the word over and over and over until I got sick. Kept wanting to scream in the theater: 'So what the heck is Immobiliare???' The film never explains coherently it's use in G3's storyline. It's just thrown out there like everything else and other than the common factor of a falling body at a given sub-plot's climax, nothing fits. And no exception, all corpses fallings are outrageously funny–especially... erhm, was that the Pope? There was one cleric bearing a strong resemblance to John Paul I–Hey does it matter it was the Pope? The fall was a hoot. I should be repelled by the callousness these people were killed but all I can do was laugh–this never happened when I watched 1st 2 Godfather Movies, Goodfellas, Bugsy. Except for the most moving scene in the film, Michael talking about his guilt over whacking Fredo with a priest–what do priests have to do with what's going on? Also stomach turning...It wasn't so much Sofia's amateurish acting but her smile. Every time seeing it why was I reminded of someone struggling keeping a big piece of snot in the nose? Distracting as was the Immobiliare cow moo. But what shocked me most of all was Connie–Was she on drugs or booze or wanted have a relationship with only surviving brother Mike she didn't put two and two together about what happened to Fredo? She sure knew who was responsible for 1st hubby Carlo's getting whacked. Where was G1 and G2's character who was shrewish but smart when it came to being a woman in a mafia family. When she yapped about Fredo being drowned that started my down slide thinking this film muddled tripe. The incest subplot was icky but it and Michael remembering his first wife and guilt-ridden over Fredo half way made sense. The passing of mantle to Sonny's son was just not developed, the Zaza friction thing had one scene-one that was worth watching and like the Sonny's son story sloppily written. The whole thing was poorly done, disjointed and jumpy. New York, Sicily, Vatican--Immobiliare! Rate it 3 for the funny falling corpses.",3,1,2,27 February 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Pornformers--Disgust meets MY eye, hits my brain, goes to my stomach...
","The twins bothered me little to none; have older twin sisters--Nowif they had been named Sideswipe & Sunstreaker I'd been big time irate. Black & female, I found TF1 more racist of the two; Glen Whitman's 1st 3 scenes were groan inducing, the scene of his & Maggie's taken into custody was horribly blatant. Later Whitman delivered the goods (Unlike Sam's super annoying idiot college roomie). Was hoping Glen Whitman and Maggie Madsen would return in TF2.Having seen ROTF, wouldn't be surprised learning Rachel Taylor walked away once apprised what script required her to do. As Alice pushed Sam on bed considered walking out but 'I'd miss Prime'. Happily I stayed; classiest character in 2.5 hrs of over top sexploitation profanity and ignorance. Enduring Prime's TF1 'Sorry, my bad' or Skids and Mudflap's antics; guess who wins. For love of Prime, only that, I'll rate it a 2--one for each 20 minutes he's on screen. Advised my one married sister (by the way, she married a twin) this wasn't fit for her 10 year old to see and she agreed. I'd even go out on a limb saying Transie girls suffering low esteem in terms of appearance steered even further away. No other way I can interpret it; Bay's forgot female fans a little more than the young boys target market.Where's respect for women? Hot or dumb boats, no middle ground called smart--including Alice; could've tried knocked Mikaela out when she burst in on her with Sam. Was Alice panty peekaboo necessary? It's obvious Mommy Witwicky doesn't recognize joint plant on package even though she has a young adult son. Not one of those hot co-eds wore loose below waist clothing to the knee or weigh over 130. Mikaela's wardrobe is poster girl for absurd, worst of all her standing white slacks and no bra...in the desert, in an Islamic community...riiiight. Shows how little homework was employed throwing this together and/or no woman on staff pointing out women would more likely wear coveralls working in a garage. Why I didn't I spot only one buff guy entire film and no shirtless guy, buff or stick? (Nauseating) thong butt cheeks failed distracting me from what I really wanted! Why did I leave 1st & 2nd times deciding only hot guy was ten ton Autobot leader? Was doing ear candy double dipping; needed to as I didn't get it from my ultimate Decepticon brand ear candy. Biggest letdown regarding v/a's Bay hires ford Agency girls yet doesn't bother renting a synthesizer for Soundwave! Dunno why but do know Mikaela wants Sam to say he loves her. And she urges him to do it in various ways again and again and again--Wait a sec, didn't by his TF1 actions showed he cared for her? What happened to Mikaela? Before the infamous Wheelie humpty she's flirting with it and it's Sam who pokes it off! How does Mikaela going through 3 sexy suits in space of under ten minutes contribute to Decepticons wreaking havoc, develop The Fallen into a more menacing creature--I'll spoil it for you she's not pivotal in either situation. Script wise she was given more to in TF1; this she's hot fest, ahem, why is she in this? Most annoying change is her clinging to Sam--crying out loud have her take the Matrix to Optimus! Having pointed this out, a slightly deeper question: why couldn't Mikaela already be in college on an engineering scholarship? Why couldn't both of them be members of Nest? Yes besides more screen time for Lennox & Epps--oh wait forgot, less situations permitting Mikaela dressing to sexy excess.",2,3,13,12 July 2009
War of the Worlds," And this is the man who made 'Schindler's List'?????
","The same man made this badly edited, cutesy poo goo at the end piece of trash! There's a lot about it I like: the set up of our main characters and the portion of the invasion until after they flee the boat. After that reality in the film's events do a major splitsville. Okay sonny goes off but why was it necessary to show the tedium of wacko guy, then two Farriers with wacko guy v. alien probe and the aliens themselves! They reminded me of a trio of three legged Chihuahuas over-sized via CGI--I'm still get a chuckle recalling my looking at them. Not scary, Spielberg, and certainly not as they were described in Welles' book. Then after another equally long feel good lunacy (oh we did one in thing) the viewer is jumped to the end raced to apparently a worse planet of unreality: unmarked house, no smudge on the elderly parents and oh lookit here's sonny boy not even in a stretcher or a arm in a sling. Gosh. And where was my favorite line 'Nothing can touch them' that was in two trailers?Spielberg shame on you!",3,4,6,16 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I'd hug George Lucas tight if I could!!!!!
","IMO After ep# 4 this is the best Star Wars movie I've ever seen. It strikes the perfect balance: action, more coherent politics, gorgeous scenery and Padme's preggo wardrobe. Another observation on Padme fashion: every hairstyle Portman wears in this I was thinking: 'Niiicee, wish I had enough hair to wear that'; 'How did they do it'? She looks way better in the 'iconic' Leia Organa double bun hairstyle.With its many dark parts & what's left of Vader post climatic Kenobi duel, ROTS isn't a light-hearted take the youngsters without worry for sensitive child film. It's ending is bittersweet reasons others I'm sure have wrote about. Saber duels better than 1st 2--I especially note the Yoda v. Emperor fight--Literally & figuratively, it hacks episode #2's Dooku v. Yoda to bits.Not boring annoying characters in this one--Well Grrrrr Binks appears 2x to my recollection but its in passing. The mechanized Sith Lord could have been irking with his coughing he does but he's also creepy mean in every scene he's in. The special effects are awesome but I found myself paying more attention to the gradual downward spiral of Anakin. Hayden Christinsen is one of the biggest assets to this film. The action elements his role called for attributed to that. He still looks awkward in the couple action scenes though--but even that's not at the ep#2 level *me cringing let me out of here* Dump the other 2 prequels--this is the must see as it has all the relevant elements in the future events.",7,1,3,5 January 2009
Inception," Reminds me of the 1st Twilight Zone series in a very good way.
","I hope if this fails getting an Academy Awards nomination it wins the Saturn Award for best picture. It's pleasantly confusing and the 'dream team' acts adult level and professional. There's too many sci-fi films were researcher heroes supposed to be colleagues working together but I can't believe it for the lack of discipline. Thank God there's no love interest side story that takes attention from the rest of the goings one. It instead adds deeper sense of tragedy.I was sucked into this world and 20 minutes in I didn't know where the dreams began or the whole thing was a dream. It reminded me of the twilight zone that the dream technology was refined into an art.I loved Leonardo Di Capro in this, torn by guilt, but staunch on getting the job and why he wants to succeed.",9,2,7,10 August 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Bat-thug v. Man of Sour--Are you kidding me?
","Maybe I should start reading comics again. When did Batman--I saw this film a little over two months ago and still have yet to get over the caped crusader handling a gun to kill people and branding criminals. I can't decide which I was taken aback with most. When did he stop being a detective? Some one tell me where other than finding the picture of Wonder Woman that his investigative actions weren't driven by his wanting to killing or maim someone. Lois Lane was doing the detection things Batman should've been doing. Instead I get Bat-thug!!!!And O-M-G Superman is even worse--With his powers he could have saved people dying in the congress hearing scene. Hearing and/or X-ray vision and super-speed found the bomb and carried it away as quick as one could snap their fingers. But wait, was Lois in the room during the hearing? I don't remember seeing him fly away with her in his arms. I saw it too many times. I do remember every time she was in jeopardy he stopped anything in his tracks to rescue her. Hello, uh, other people in the world. There's only two scenes where he helps someone who's not close to him and only one of those two were touching. This Superman other than his looks didn't like him at all--Too boring, brooding, less than caring for strangers, and worst of all doesn't take the time to try to make others see his reasons he did the things he did. The hearing which he comes no speech about the destruction in the first film and the battle in Africa that happens earlier. Superman's speech in 'Quest for Peace' for me now is his 2nd best the first being the one he makes at the end of Superman II.Watch this super dark, super confusing, humorless piece of crap on those devices where the viewing can be speed it up. Get to all the itsy-bitsy parts with Wonder Woman. She was the ONLY super heroine that engaged my interest. I sat upright in my chair thanking God I didn't walk out (and I so wanted to 3 times) when I saw her using her lasso. Thing I think that made her stand out was that action-wise she was transported to the big screen with little to no tampering with her character or fighting style. Can't wait to see her film.In closing, I will state I won't mention the other characters as I want to spare you the reader from long, long tirade regarding Alex Luthor Joker Poser, forgettable Flash, forgettable Cyborg and biker gang man stereotype lookalike that was Aquaman.",1,8,17,25 June 2016
Goodfellas," This is more realistic than the Godfather
","What crime lord is going to have a wedding so out in the open that the press of cops could show up? No putting Godfather 1& 2 down (Now #3 is a whole other story) but based on documentaries I've seen Goodfellas better captures the feel of the Mafia world. From Paul Sorvino's Don on down the group introduced to us plays down their money. Godfather's characters just don't. Sorcesse (sp) does not attempt to an effort to glamorize these characters or make their image appealing. What kept me glued was second the moral descent of Karen; it was like watching a close friend or relative ignoring warnings and making big and bigger mistakes to keep the poison relationship going. And main reason, there's Joe Pesci; I was happy to find out he won an Oscar. Funniest Creepiest movie gangster in any movie I've seen.",9,0,0,2 March 2009
