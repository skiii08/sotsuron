The Blair Witch Project," Worst horror movie I have ever seen.
","I was very disappointed by this movie.  I was really looking forward to seeing it because of everything I had heard, but this was a real dud.  I was prepared for a low quality picture because of the relatively small expense, but this film was poorly shot even by those standards.  It was hard to distinguish details for key elements of the movie.  The ending was unintelligible.The acting was terrible.  I couldn't wait until Heather Donahue stopped screaming, which she did through the whole movie.At least the old Hammer horror films were funny while they were bad.  This one is not even worth watching.  Don't waste your time.",1,2,4,15 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The worst movie of the series!!!!
","Do not bother to see this movie!!!  It is definitely the worst one of the series.  The script is terrible and the acting is very bad as well.  The worst part of this movie is the love scenes involving Anakin & Amidala.  The dialog is laughably bad.  There is no chemistry between anyone.  They even tried to do some banter between Anakin & Amidala similar to Han Solo & Princess Leia, but it did not work at all.  Every character's speech is so formal.  It takes all the fun out of the film.  The special effects are alright, but it seems like Lucas is just trying to make each alien look more weird than the last.  He is making these worse instead of better.  Another terrible part is the fight scene between Yoda & Count Dooku.  The site of the little alien flipping around Christopher Lee made it look like a Tom & Jerry cartoon.
I know the movie is making tons of money, so Hollywood will consider it a success, but we can only hope that enough people will complain and maybe George Lucas will improve the quality for Episode 3.  If not, I will wait until it comes on cable.",1,0,1,13 June 2002
