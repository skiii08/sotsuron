The Ring," Loved this!! *SPOILERS*
","I've seen this movie twice, yet I know that there are things that I have missed throughout the whole movie. This no doubt was one of the scariest I've ever seen. Sure, teen horror flicks give you a jump or two, but this one made me traumatized from the TV and closet for quite some time. (Dumb, haha I  know...but still. Did YOU not unplug your TV or leave your closet open for a week? no? ok...)The Second time around, I tried studying the Video more closely and caught a few more things than I did the first. But there's one thing I'm confused about. You know how in real life, Rachel would see something from the video? I don't think she saw the severed finger thing. That, I got confused at. but Samara still scared the crap outta me when she attacked Noah at the end. ahh..*chills* anyhow, I hope everyone liked the movie. I loved it.it will definitely go down as one of my favorites, and major props to those who choreographed the storyboard and for the manuscript itself. bravo! :-D",Null,0,0,26 November 2002
