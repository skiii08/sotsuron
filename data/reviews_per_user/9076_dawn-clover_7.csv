Black Swan," Disappointing
","After reading several reviews, watching the trailers and watching the IMDb rate go up like a flash, I was ready for some Mystery / Thriller action! Even if it involved ballet (nothing against it, just not my cup of tea).The thing is, this movie has nothing of mystery in it, and just a teeny bit of thriller. It was disappointing to say the least - especially since I'm a huge fan of 'The Fountain', 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream' from Darren Aronofsky. Instead of a psychological mystery thriller that gets under your skin until the very end, we get a drama disguised as a psychological mystery thriller until the hugely disappointing ending, which is capable of destroying almost the whole experience. Yes, I know the movie is categorized as a drama as well, but it was heavily promoted as a Mystery Thriller. The movie starts like any Mystery Thriller would - slow build up, weird stuff happens, viewer is left wondering what is going on, but unfortunately it ends almost ignoring all these cryptic scenes that make you think through the first two acts of the movie. What's left in the end is... almost what you have in the beginning, just a bit prettier.In the visual department it was stunning to look at. The visual effects are top notch and the photography as well. The music fitted like a glove, it almost felt like we were watching an actual ballet act instead of the movie (and yes, I don't enjoy ballet, but props must be given here). The actors also did an excellent job, Natalie Portman (Nina) portrayed her character brilliantly, and we could always see what she was feeling inside without her having to speak. Mila Kunis (Lily) was also a wonder to watch act, she did the complete opposite of Nina (as supposed) excellently.Overall, it's a well acted, edited and scored movie that falls incredibly short in a department I was not expecting to be disappointed at (this coming from Darren Aronofsky and all): the plot.I guess I got too hyped? Either way, I feel it was a mediocre film because it failed in one of the most important aspects of cinema.4 out of 10.",5,1,3,23 April 2011
Silent Hill," I'm still shaking...
","I cannot believe what my eyes just saw. I am so shocked with this movie. Being a fan from the game since the first one was released for the PS1 i have to say this became instantly my favorite movie right after Pyramid Head made his first appearance, and believe me, it was a huge appearance.You may have noticed i am a big fan of the character, though he didn't appear a lot in the movie, he was awesome.Well, about the movie now, as i said i am still shaking and i still have the chills when thinking about the movie, my mouth is opened and my face probably has a 'shocked' expression, has that is the feeling i sense right now, i'm shocked.This is definitely the best movie i've ever seen from beginning to the end. The monsters were really well chosen (and the new ones, they're just totally CREEPY, the Gray Child totally freaked me out, i was shaking from hair to toes, and believe me i'm not frightened so easily; i must have been the only person on the theater watching 'The Exorcist' who did not feel scared almost at all, well, some suspense maybe).I'm taking ages to write this comment, and why? Because i can't see no proper words to describe this, i'm trembling all over and all i can think is about the scene where Alessa finally has her revenge. That was the freakiest thing i've ever seen.About the ending of the movie, since this has become quite the talks here on the forums: i think we WILL have a sequel, i mean, did you notice the way Sharon looked at Dahlia, and the way she looked when they arrived... 'home'? I too think the ending gives us a lot to think about, i have quite a weird theory: what if Rose and Sharon, and Cybil died in the car crash? Yes, in the beginning. And I say this, because of the ending, or that happened or they were still trapped in the other dimension, and if it's the 'dark one who opens and closes the door to Silent Hill' why didn't 'the dark one' (a.k.a. Alessa) let Rose and Sharon go back? These doubts are killing me, i want more, i want MUCH MORE! I have to congratulate Christophe Gans, he's made my favorite game become also my favorite movie, i freaking love you (not in the way many of you are thinking lol) and we want more! Give us a sequel! This is the best movie ever. That is all.",10,2,5,23 April 2006
Shutter Island," Absolutely amazing roller-coaster ride
","When I went o see 'Shutter Island', all I knew about the movie was the obvious: it was about an island and DiCaprio acted in it. The Portuguese translation of the title, hugely misleading ('Ilha do Medo' = 'Island of Fear') made me believe this was going to be just another horror flick.Boy, was I glad I was wrong!'Shutter Island' is filled with symbolisms and hidden meanings in almost 100% of the scenes composing the movie. So much interpretation can be drawn from this movie. Unlike many other movies out there, it feels complete. It feels perfect, there's nothing missing. Following Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) through his visit to Shutter Island will make you feel like you're there, going through the same things he is all throughout the numerous twists and turns the movie takes.The soundtrack to this movie is just superb, fitting the movie like a glove and driving it through different feelings and ambiances. Visually this movie is just beautiful, the contrasts used are just a wonder to look at, I couldn't take my eyes away for a second.The acting was incredibly top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio makes an outstanding job (which he got us used to). Mark Ruffalo (Chuck) and Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) are amazing as well, bringing his characters into life making them feel like they are real. Even if a bit overshadowed by DiCaprio. The rest of the cast is top notch as well, I have not a single complaint.If you want to drown yourself into an amazing psychological mystery thriller experience, you must watch this movie now. Incredible.Flawless 10 out of 10.",10,0,2,23 April 2011
The Butterfly Effect," What a ride!
","'The Butterfly Effect' evokes a weird, lasting feeling of shock when the credits roll. It's a powerful and complete movie that will mess with your head in all the right ways.The character development here is superb, having the viewer take a trip through the most important moments in the life of the main characters (even in their childhood) while maintaining these scenes crucial to the main plot. Which is the greatest aspect of this movie by far.The licensed music fits perfectly in the movie (I also found out quite some bands / songs I enjoy through this movie!) and the original compositions are just amazing. The visual effects are top notch, without ever feeling like too much or too little, it's just right, just how it should be. Photography is a wonder to look at, showing amazingly well when a scene is in the present or the past, without distracting too much from the whole experience.Acting is also superb in here, with every actor delivering their characters like they should - even the younger ones! Impressed!This movie is for you if you enjoy a haunting and bone-chilling mystery thriller that will mess with your head and keep you glued to the screen until the very end. A classic, for me.Flawless 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,24 April 2011
Kick-Ass," This movie is Kick-Ass!
","I've never been a huge fan of super hero movies. I've enjoyed Spider-Man (the first two), and one or two Superman movies, but I've never been too much into them.'Kick-Ass' is not your usual super hero movie. Actually, the main character can't even be called a real super hero. A hero? Sure! But there's nothing super about him, it's not like he can climb walls, fly or has inhuman strength. He's pretty good at getting the crap beaten out of him though! But kicking some ass as well!The plot is fun to follow, and the actors give some very good interpretations. The action is awesome, especially scenes involving Hit Girl - seriously, a young girl kicking so much ass and spreading so much blood, this probably had some people very ticked off... which I see as a good thing!Photography is pretty good, the color palette of the movie is colorful and often gritty, giving it a rough comic book style look. Which, of course, fits the movie like a glove. The music is great! Some epic, climatic moments that accompany the scenes flawlessly and leave them even more engaging!Overall, if you're a fan of action / comedy movies and/or super hero movies, you must watch this movie.8 out of 10.",8,1,5,1 May 2011
The Fountain," Absolutely Mindblowing
","'The Fountain' is a movie like no other. A powerful spiritual and organic voyage into the unknown abstract. This is, by far, one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen in my life.The movie tells its story very subtly, perhaps in the vein of Kubrick, but a powerful tale about love and death non-the-less. I won't speak more of the plot in fear of spoiling anything, but it is amazing.The cast did an outstanding job, especially the main actors, bringing these characters into life, making us feel them, believe in them and go through the feelings with them. The love between Tommy and Izzi is palpable. Tommy's sadness is so unnerving and upsetting, it makes the whole trip that much touching.Visually, the movie is absolutely perfect. Mind blowing eye candy visual effects. A fantastical vision that contrasts itself with the theme that surrounds the movie. So pretty yet so sad. So simple, yet so powerful. Photography is top notch as well, very dark and morbid at times, portraying the scenes perfectly.The music is hauntingly beautiful. After watching the movie I felt obligated to buy the soundtrack. Clint Mansell, together with the Kronos Quartet and Mogwai, created one of the most stunning and beautiful soundtracks I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. As powerful as the movie, touching, just absolutely beautiful.I can't really fit this movie into any genre... If you're in for a very visual, touching and powerful drama / sci-fi movie you have got to give this a try!The way the last few minutes of the movie made me feel, summarize the movie very well: Goosebumps.Flawless 10 out 10.",10,2,4,28 April 2011
The Simpsons Movie," Hilarious
","When talking about 'The Simpsons' you know there will be people running to 2 different sides. Some of them loved the show, now hate it and some of them love the show, period. And there are of course, those who never enjoyed it.I've always enjoyed 'The Simpsons'. Granted I've enjoyed the first few seasons a lot more (even though it seems to be going back to its roots now), but still enjoy the new material. The movie could be considered a mix between old and new Simpsons, and for me, the only place it fails is at not giving the side characters more screen time.Other than that, the movie is hilarious from start to finish, even if some of the jokes are sketchy at best, most of them succeed at at least making you smile, and others at making you laugh of loud. The plot is very crazy and nonsensical, but hey, it's a cartoon, as long as it is entertaining - which it is - it works!The animation is top notch, very fluid, with some 3D elements thrown in (thankfully not too many). The voice actors did an excellent job, as usual. Music is good, but didn't stand out too much, it did it's job (except 'Spider Pig', which is awesome!). Of course, there's Green Day in it, but I don't enjoy them (not my cup of tea to be honest).It's a great fun, hilarious and very entertaining movie that should be watched by people who enjoy the Simpsons. Especially the 'newer' seasons, I can see people who don't like the new seasons hating this movie.9 out of 10.",9,2,3,1 May 2011
