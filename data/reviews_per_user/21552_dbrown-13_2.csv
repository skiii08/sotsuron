Requiem for a Dream," Much, much more than just another 'drug movie'
","Some of the mainstream reviews I had read about this movie prior to watching it didn't describe this movie favourably. Many of the criticisms were that this was just another 'drug movie', just another tale of hopelessness and despair. Some said that the story of addiction told here was 'unrealistic', some even suggested that this movie and it's approach were glorifying drug use.After watching this I wondered if these reviewers had just watched the same film I had?? This has to be the most harrowing, unsettling, and yet utterly compelling film dealing with the issue of drug use, and the effects it has on those involved I have ever seen. This is, and I state for the record, in no way glorifying, sensationalising, or condoning drug use in any way.It tells of the plight of 4 individuals, their respective descent into drug dependency, the effects this has on their relationships with each other, and the eventual lengths they will go to feed their addiction. On the contrary to the reviews I had read earlier, it occurs to me the depiction here is perhaps a little too 'realistic' for recreational viewing. Though this movie is certainly not 'easy going' it is a rewarding experience in the end.The film benefits from first rate performances (particularly Ellen Burstyn - an acting tour de force), superb cinematography and solid directing. The jump cuts and fast editing work really well here too, setting a suitable tone for the movie, conveying the character's disjointed and erratic perceptions of reality to the viewer effectively. Lastly the haunting musical score composed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is as striking as it is original, complementing the mood of the movie perfectly.There is always a danger when making a movie dealing with issues such as these that the end result may appear contrived or over-sentimental, that the overall message become muddled; conflicting. This isn't the case with 'Reqiuem for a Dream', thanks to faultless execution in all aspects this movie is nothing short of excellent - 10/10.",10,6,11,20 March 2007
The Illusionist," I liked this movie, and yet I didn't
","Odd, but I did have mixed feelings after I watched this movie!Technically the movie is perfection! The set-pieces and costumes are excellent. The lighting is used very effectively and the usage of older camera techniques such as the camera eye fade really do set the scene superbly. You almost believe you are watching 19th century Vienna, it's that good!The acting too is excellent. I have always been a fan of Edward Norton, his performance as Eienheim the Illusionist here is very enigmatic and engaging. I have heard gripes about his accent but I could't see a problem. Rufus Sewell and Paul Giamati are also outstanding in their supporting roles. Sewell's Crown Prince exudes menace and authority in the right proportions while Giamati's police inspector struggles to balance his respect and admiration for Eisenheim (which he conveys flawlessly) with his allegiance to the Crown Prince and his wishes.**Spoilers ahead**The problem with this movie is the plot, mainly in terms of the final 'twist'. In essence a 'twist' only really works when you don't see it coming, sadly this is not the case here. The movie gave away far too many hints too early to make the twist effective, particularly early dialogue between Eisenheim and Sophie. I won't go into specifics, suffice to say that I almost didn't expect the twist coming because that seemed too obvious. So I suppose you could say the twist worked as a double bluff!Another problem I had with this movie were the illusions or 'tricks' Eisenheim performed. Throughout the film we are treated to several examples of these, and with few exceptions the illusions are so wondrous that had you seen someone perform these for real they would appear truly 'magical'. So, of course, in the end when the film attempts to explain the 'Orange Tree' illusion as purely mechanical fakery, this just doesn't seem feasible, it looks too real, too perfect! The same goes for all of Eisenheim's illusions, it is simply not believable that they were performed to the standards we saw with the technology available in the late 19th century.So, in summary, overall I enjoyed the movie because it was executed so well, but the key plot points could have done with a little more thought to make them effective. 6/10",6,0,2,20 March 2007
