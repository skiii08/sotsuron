The Avengers," A film of Pure excellence
","Before the film had even came out in cinema's, I knew I would like it, but when I saw it. Even I was just intrigued and astounded at literally how good this film actually was. From the beginning of the movie, you are pulled straight into the story and the action and it continuous throughout the movie. The comedy sections pull in really well, as they are not constant and most of the time you do not expect the comedy to occur.Each character within the movie brings something to the entire thing, I felt for each character, pulled into their whole situation. I can easily say that this is probably the best or one of the best movies I have ever seen throughout my entire life. The action was perfect, the dialogue was compelling and original, to be honest all in all the movie was just extraordinary.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great story, action, comedy and the occasional drama.Definitely a movie to see, you will be amazed at just how good this movie is, I know I sure was.",10,2,6,29 April 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Loved it from Beginning to End
","From the moment this movie started, I was completely engrossed and knew I was going to love the film. When it finished I was just amazed at how much I liked it, so the next day I watched it again.I recommend this film to anyone who is fond of Fantasy movies, as this film is just amazing.Some people do say that the film is too long, but if you give it a chance, then maybe you will enjoy it.I have watched this film with one of my mates and he was rude enough to ask me to turn it off half way through, he informed me then that it just isn't his type of film.In the fantasy genre this film is completely and utterly the greatest fantasy movie to watch.",10,0,0,22 March 2012
