Iron Man 3," Tiresome Iron Men VS Hot Matchstick Men
","This is the silliest and most pathetic Iron Man film. Tony has been primped to the max yet fails to entertain. I think there was more time spent on his hair than his acting. The surreal plot pins 'iron' men against matchstick men and women, all in a predictable story line that makes one yawn even at the 'exciting' parts. There are few good guys to cheer for, the VP is corrupted, the President is a corporate lackey, the ex girl friend waffles between good and evil like she was deciding what pair of shoes to buy. The kid who befriends The Mechanic is so contrived that he is hardly memorable, but just so that you do recall the vague lad, the child is rewarded with gadgets and gizmo's in his dilapidated barn/garage. The film in its entirety is pathetic - I rate it a good waste of a few hours. VD = Very Disappointing",2,1,3,7 February 2014
The Matrix Reloaded," Eye popping, yet boring.
","The Matrix suffers the fate of the middle child in a family of three, a trilogy.  Not the first flash of genius and certainly not the last word, this middle child hopes to get by on its slick looks and rough and tumble ways.  Only references to Myth and Religion must sustain the loyal zealot of the Matrix saga. It is not enough.",5,0,0,25 May 2003
