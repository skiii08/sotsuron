The Expendables 2," its dumb clich√© and fun to watch
",its filled with every b movie action scene known to man. everyone talk with deep burly macho voice using one-liners. people have nitro as blood because they explode when shot. the plot is lousy and full of more holes then the billions of dead enemies in this movie.the animation effects is horrible.but its fun.it has self-distance and its nice to be able to shut down the brain and just watch.i recommend it and hopefully it has burned out b action movie plots/characters for all eternity so hard you will never have to go trough it ever again in this life.,7,6,14,21 August 2012
