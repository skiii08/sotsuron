The Ring," A fine move, plenty scary, but...
","*** Spoilers ***This was a good movie, it was very suspenseful, and scary, but the whole story doesn't tie together very well. They never explained, or even hinted how the video tape can kill people, who is calling on the phone (Don't they have caller ID?) and plenty of other little tidbits are left unfinished. This does not ruin the movie, it's still fun to watch, but it does keep it from being a REALLY good movie. There's lots of fun to be had watching it, take the spotty story with a grain of salt, and it's fine. 7/10",7,1,2,12 July 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun!
","I was a little confused at first. What was this I was seeing on the screen? Could it be... why.. yes, I think it is... YES, Actual Creativity on a cinema screen. How did the Hollywood execs ever allow this to happen? Especially during the 'Summer of Sequels'? Actual new ideas, creative plot, unpredictability, and NOT FULL OF OVERBLOWN SPECIAL EFFECTS just because they are available.Johnny Depp was fantastic, and this is from a guy who never liked his acting (until last night anyway). Orlando Bloom was servicable, Geoffry Rush was great as usual. The writing and direction was top-notch.I still can't believe it, someone at Disney had an original idea. What could be next? Can Fox be far behind? 9/10",9,0,1,12 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Worthy of being called a Star Wars movie
","This was a drastic improvement over 'The Phantom Meanace'. This movie is definitely worthy of its namesake. In fact, it even made 'Phantom Meanace' more tolerable (although perhaps still no more watchable), because it explained why we needed some of the seemingly meaningless information (and characters) from that film. It was very interesting to see some of the story lines begin to be tied together.The acting and dialog is not bad. Especially not as bad as some people here are saying. The dialog was simple, so as not to lose the younger viewers, but not bad. Let's remember, 'I wanted to go into Tashi station to pick up some power converters' isn't exactly scintillating dialog either. But it serves its purpose. There are some awkward moments, but if you can forgive them, you'll have a blast.The basic fact here is that this is a good story, and all the bad reviews in the world can't spoil it. This was the case when 'A New Hope' was originally released in 1977, just as it is now. The story is supported by stunning visuals, fun characters, spectacular sound, and some enjoyable campy moments. It won't win any Best Actor or Best Picture awards, but I have to think it's a box-office threat to even 'Titanic'.Go see it, you'll have a great time. (9/10)",9,0,0,23 May 2002
Black Hawk Down," Yeesh, does everyone have to detail their politics here?
","I've been reading some of the comments here, and what they seem to be overlooking is that this is a fantastic movie, and a true story. Personally, I don't have to agree with the politics of a movie to enjoy it.Some people point out that there were thousands of Somalis killed in this incident, but they were portrayed as 'evil'. Not one person has pointed out that the Somalis in question were supporting a warlord who was stealing food from starving people. They'd rather just spew the hackneyed, common anti-American drivel that all other countries spew, until they need assistance, that is.Either way, I don't think the point of the movie was to comment politically on the incident, but rather to tell a story, and communicate the horror of what happened. I thought it did this brilliantly. The characters were a little under-developed, but otherwise, this is a top-rate flick. 8.5/10",Null,0,0,14 February 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Tries REALLY Hard (Spoilers)
","This movie tries SOOO hard to live up to the original. The Wachowski brothers must have spent long hours coming up with fight scenes, digital effects, and interesting story twists. Unfortunately, they didn't put so much time into the script.The film is dazzling to the eye. At any given time, there's so much goung on, it's impossible to comprehend everything that you are seeing. The detail is amazing. The fight scenes are coreographed magnificently, and there is enough adrenaline for three movies. However, this is accompanied by some of the most painful dialog in recent memory. The dialog makes Attack of the Clones look like Pulp Fiction.There's also a certain matter-of-factness to the movie that just doesn't fit. Neo's thought process seems to be 'Ok, now it's time to fight the Asian guy... Now I will fight the evil agent, hold on, I can fly, now I'll fight the french guy's bodyguards, wait, let's fly again, Now I'll rescue Morpheus... etc.' There's no flow, just a bunch of disconnected scenes.I've heard people who didn't like the acting. I don't think that's fair. With this script, there's really no time for acting, that would get in the way of the action. The only times the movie slows down, it is time for the characters to all try to sound wise. All the mamby-pamby babbling about fate really will get on your nerves. There are a few interesting twists near the end, but it's a long way to get there.The Wachowskis also tried very hard to get the R rating. There's nothing inherently R in the story, so they threw in a few boobs and a few curses to get the R they wanted. If your 14 year old can handle seeing a flash of bare breasts and hearing curses (they probably do in school every day anyhow), there's no reason to shield them from the movie.The first Matrix was fresh, clean, smart, and inventive. The new one is none of these, it's just eye candy. Turn your brain off and open your eyes for two hours, and you'll have a great time. Don't expect anything intelligent, however. 6.5/10",6,0,0,23 May 2003
