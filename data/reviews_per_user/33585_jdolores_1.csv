Scarface," An epic gangster saga
","This film basks in its' own wonderous excess.  The excess varies from four letter words to violence to clothing to money.  Al Pacino crafts one of the greatest performances of his career as the hedonistic Tony Montana.  The supporting cast is filled with a wealth of brilliant performances headlined by Michelle Pfieffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.  If you are looking for top of the line writing by Oliver Stone and brilliant direction from Brian DePalma, then Scarface (1983) is the perfect choice.  Without delving into the plot, the rise and fall of a criminal mastermind has never been portrayed so energetically and passionately.  As one watches, one can see and feel the collective joy of the creators at work.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
