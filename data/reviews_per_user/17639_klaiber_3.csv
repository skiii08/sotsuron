Antz," Impressive animation, pleasantly intelligent
","PDI did a stunning job on the animation here --- I was particularly amazed at the ants' expressive faces and the wonderful underground settings.  What pleased me most, though, was the very funny and intelligent script; not the usual dumbed-down Disneyesque drivel so often found in G-rated animations. May there be more of its kind!",9,0,0,4 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," flashy, but empty shell
","Call me a sucker, but I loved the original Star Wars movies, in spite of some of their obvious hokiness.  In this installment, special effects have made a stunning leap forward since the first movie, but -- and I know this is hard to believe -- the age of the target audience and the quality of the script have taken an equal step back.'The Phantom Menace' seems squarely aimed at the video-game playing 8-year and under crowd -- can you spot the scenes that will be made into games? (And that appear to only be there for that very purpose?)  Literally every scene with young Anakin in it was painful to watch, so clumsy was the writing -- even the actors (actors?) seemed embarrassed at times.  Did the marketing department insist that a young boy be included as a marketable hero, for the merchandise customers to identify with?What's there to like?  The light saber fights, and the special effects; all extremely well done.  If some of the other scenes (alluded to above) had ended up on the cutting-room floor, the movie wouldn't have been any more devoid of plot and in fact, I'd have enjoyed it a lot more overall.In summary: I loved the glitz, but not near enough to make up for the embarrassingly bad, toy-marketing-driven script.  A good friend called the movie 'The Phantom Plotline'.  Well said.  The merchandise is real enough, though.",2,1,2,25 May 1999
American Beauty," Dull male fantasy
","I was hoping for a nicely disturbing story with some really interesting oddball characters in it.  Instead, the story's just a male midlife-crisis fantasy ('my only problem is my annoying wife'), and the characters are cliched caricatures who only manage to irritate the viewer.  (Maybe the simplistic male theme and perspective explain the one-dimensional female protagonists?)  The movie tries to hide its thin plot and dull characters behind the cheap expedient of disconnectedly breaking a few 'taboos' here and there -- masturbation, nudity, voyeurism, drugs and paedophilia, in no particular order.  So what!  Shocking?  Titillating?  No: simply boring.  I cannot fathom why critics would detect originality in this loser of a movie. In fact, I think it's an interesting social commentary that apparently many viewers find profundity in this movie, and identify with its dull, dull, dull characters.  Now THAT is scary and disturbing...",1,11,28,4 November 1999
