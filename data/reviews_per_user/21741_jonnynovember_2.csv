10 Cloverfield Lane," A Pretentious Contrived nonsense of a film !
","There are a lot of glowing reviews of this film ! I cannot understand why... The film is well made yes & also great performances. The story however is little more than a contrived tenuous nonsense ...... Designed to peek out intrigue- is it, isn't it,,,, did he didn't he ! the simple element to overcoming all this nonsense occurs in the final scene ! Which I was wondering through the entire film why is this not happening !? excuse my vagary but i don't want to add a spoiler ! ... watch this film if you are a weak minded idiot and enjoy .. otherwise don't waste your time ... apparently imdv needs me to write more lines.. OK.. once again this film is Pretentious contrived nonsense ..",4,0,1,20 December 2016
Incendies," Utterly Dismal & totally Ridiculous !!
","Having just watched this abomination of a film I felt it my duty to write a review from a Perspective of Sanity !! This Film presents itself initially with Poise grace and soul ... However the twists & turns of the convoluted plot, which appear to promise a truly great finale' Deliver a body Blow of disappointment !!! Sucked in by the emotional trauma of the protagonist, which appear initially Plausible, the credibility of the entire production is neutralised by the most idiotic and ridiculous 'Twist' at the end as we are finally privy to scripted plot. The Long Lost son, Turned Torturer, Rapes His Mother, (not knowing Who she really is) whilst she is imprisoned (& is the father of her twins !). Only to then turn up half way around the world 20 years later, standing right in front of her at a swimming pool with the one Piece of evidence that would show her his true identity; A tattoo on the Heel of his right foot, placed there at Birth .. Seriously !! What the Hell where you thinking !!! I feel Utterly Insulted !!",1,28,69,11 May 2013
