The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A must see!
","I thought the movie was excellent! I'm not just saying that because i'm a girl and i'm crazy over the saga, i really did enjoy the movie from start to finish. I think if you haven't read the books and you go to watch the movies then you are really missing out. You need to understand the love and connections between each character to really enjoy the film, i thought the acting was much better and the overall atmosphere of the film improved greatly.One thing i would say to the males (since that's who the majority of the votes give 1/10) is that Twilight is like a teenage girls fantasy, just like you have superhero's like batman and iron man. Girls generally have a fantasy of romance rather than action and i think twilight is one of the few films out there for teenage girls which really delivers that. Also I've got to disagree with those who say that the movie was stretched out far more than necessary. Twilight fans WANT every scene from the book in the movie and although everything wasn't in, i think the film catered to its fans superbly. If they rushed through the scenes then that would be catering to the people who don't really like twilight not the fans.I would say the movie definitely did the first half of the book justice and most of the important scenes that twihards love are in there (although i did want to see the rivalry between Jacob and Rosalie). Overall an excellent film and i highly recommend everyone that likes twilight to go and see it, and everyone who doesn't or are in two minds about twilight, go read the books then watch it and you'll understand how great it really is!",10,6,20,18 November 2011
