Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The most visually spectacular film I have ever seen.
","This isn't the perfect STAR WARS film.  However, it is a fine film.  The cast isn't given much to do in terms of character or dialogue, and most of the movie's plot is used to forshadow the next two chapters.  Simply put: its fun to watch.  That should be the passing grade for any movie.",7,0,0,7 September 1999
Minority Report," So many plot holes, so little time.
","MINORITY REPORT is an achievement of directorial brilliance.  Speilberg's vision gives this movie a special quality that makes it very enjoyable to watch.  Like many science fiction films, the environment is its own character (when done right the environment in films are supporting characters, when done wrong they are the main character).  The first two acts of the film move along marvelously, with suspense, intelligence, and energy. Unfortunately the third act is an incoherent mess, filled with cliches and illogical pretenses.  I wouldn't want to give away all the third act plot twists, but I'm not sure I could type them all in a way that would make sense...not that they made any sense in the movie.  The very nature of this movie invites paradox and contradictions, since it is about people who can see the future and all.  Unlike a film like MEMENTO, however, the inconsistencies in the plot cannot be rationalized.  The best description of this movie is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (the movie) meets TIMECOP.  Not a bad formula for an action movie fan, except the film is being advertised as a stunning masterpiece of modern science fiction.  Perhaps all those critics meant the book that the movie's based on?",6,0,0,28 June 2002
Batman Returns," My favorite of the franchise.
","This wasn't a great movie.  In general, Tim Burton's films are style over substance, but man what style!  The good about this movie is the Batman/Catwoman relationship.  It was far more interesting than the romantic dynamic of the previous film, although still not what I'd consider a classic love story.  Christopher Walken is fabulous, as always.  Danny DeVito does a good job playing the character of the Penguin as written, but I did not enjoy this story's version of that character.  The bad about this movie is that it spends more time focusing on the villains than on the title character.  This seems to imply that the producer's of the film don't believe that Batman can carry a movie on his own.  Nonsense!  After all, in my opinion Batman is one of the four greatest comic characters ever created (the others being Superman, Spider-Man, and Wolverine from X-Men).  This movie is also seriously too dark, violent, and sexual for kids.  It was rated 'PG-13', but I'm sure was really close to an 'R'.",7,0,0,13 January 2001
L.A. Confidential," The finest cast ever assembled for one film.
","The strength of a movie like 'L.A. Confidential' lies in its characters.  I really enjoyed this movie because the actors in this film were able to create totally believable, complex, and interesting characters.  Every actor in this film deserved some sort of award for their performance (many of the main actors have received an Academy Award at some point in their career. Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Russell Crowe, and Kim Basinger...the film is a who's who of Oscar winners). 'L.A. Confidential' is based on the book of the same name, and simplifies the book's plot considerably for the movie.  This, however, does not water it down at all since it is still a very riveting and exciting story. The movie has tons of great moments and exciting scenes that will leave any viewer on the edge of his or her seat.  No fan of crime dramas or suspense thrillers should go without seeing this one!",8,0,1,15 April 2001
X-Men," A 96 minute tour of 37 years of comics.
","Bryan Singer has certainly succeeded in making a comic book movie that captures the flavor of the beloved Uncanny X-Men.  All of the actors capture the personalities of their comic book counter-parts (with the exception of Mystique, who in the comics was the second leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants).  The story line does not follow to an overly predictable conclusion.  A special treat was cameos by X-Men standards like Kitty Pryde and Bobby Drake.  This is a very good movie, but it does suffer from one flaw.  Its way too short.  Certainly I would hope that more time could have been spent developing Prof. Xavier, Storm, and Cyclops, without taking away from the obvious stars of the film, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman is AWESOME), Rogue, and Magneto.  And, for a comic book movie, it was a little light on the action. It is well written, and Wolverine is the natural choice to be the center of the film.  Overall, a good film.  Certainly worth the time of any fan of comics, action movies, or science fiction.",7,0,0,15 July 2000
Blade II," Action packed good time.
","Blade II is an excellent film if you are only seeing it for its action sequences.  There are many, they are big, and they are loud.  Wesley Snipes is again great as Blade, who seems a little more human this time out.  He seems more vulnerable this time around thanks in part to Blade's student/mentor relationship with Kris Kristopherson's Whistler. 
Blade also has a new partner, 'Scud', who provides comic relief and helps move the plot along when it needs it.  Blade is also teamed with a team of vampire commandos.  The commandos were awesome for the screentime they were given, and I really wish that they'd been developed more.  Ron Pearlman really stands out as the vampire with the biggest grudge against Blade. Snipes and Pearlman play well against each other in this movie.One drag on the movie, unfortunately, is Leonor Varela, playing the beautiful daughter of the vampires' supreme leader (one can assume he took over after the vampire council was destroyed in the first film).  She and Blade become a little too attached to each other a little too quickly. Varela's acting ability doesn't add anything to the part.  She only sounds believable when delivering the all-important exposition that furthers the plot.Another problem is that the plot isn't particularly clever beyond its premise.  Beyond the idea that Blade would have to team up with vampires to kill even more merciless super-vampires, the movie pretty much writes itself.  None of the double crosses that litter the film come as a surprise, and you might find yourself wondering how Blade got himself into several of the dumb situations he finds himself in.Beyond those flaws, however, you are still left with an incredible non-stop action extravaganza.  Blades deadly skills have seemed to increased since his previous film, as have his arsenal of anti-vampire gadgets.  The props and design departments for Blade II certainly did an amazing job.  Also, thanks to computer effects, Blade moves faster and is more agile than ever before.Blade II is a very well done action film.  Although it does have a few flaws, those flaws DO NOT take away from the non-stop, fast-paced action of this movie.  Not as good as the Matrix, but one hell of a good time.",7,0,1,3 April 2002
Malcolm X," This movie should be seen by every man, woman, and child in America.
","A fascinating life is given a closer work in this brilliant work by Spike Lee.  I cannot give Mr. Lee all the credit though, since Denzel Washington's performance is so incredible.  This greatest credit, though, must go to the source material from which this movie came.  Malcolm X's life was really what made this movie about his life so special.",8,2,7,8 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas has made a Star Wars film for adults...
","Star Wars Episode I was made for kids.  I firmly believe children will hate Episode II.  It is the anti-Phantom Menace, and not a kids' movie at all. It isn't action-heavy.  It has a lot of plot and dialogue, foreshadowing, and mystery to it...and romance (I fear more than a lot of people can stand).  ATTACK OF THE CLONES is quite a film.  From a technical standpoint it is superb (although I'm sure I prefer a puppet-Yoda to a CGI-Yoda).  It does have a few magnificent action scenes.  Its not what you'd call a 'fun' movie, though.  The original 1977 STAR WARS ('Episode 4') film was fun, as was RETURN OF THE JEDI and THE PHANTOM MENACE.  ATTACK OF THE CLONES fits in better with EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and is a very dark film.  (How this movie didn't get a PG-13 is a mystery up there with the Kennedy Assassination and Jack the Ripper.)  It has doses of humor, action, and fun, but those elements are overshadowed by the suspense and mystery of it.  If you go into the film with that mindset, you'll enjoy yourself and be quite pleased with ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  If you're expecting another Episode 4, you'll be disappointed.",7,0,0,16 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Man-oh-man, this is a good one!
","For me, 'The Godfather, Part II' is the kind of movie that I would drive 30 miles to see at a run-down theater in a questionable part of town.  I absolutely believe this is one of the best movies ever made.  Maybe someday I'll see it on DVD (if it's ever released), but for now I've only watched the video.  I could not stop watching this movie the first time, and every time I start to watch part of it, I have to watch it to the very end.The story is both a prequel and a continuation of 'The Godfather.'  We see a young Vito Corleone's rise to power.  We also see his son Michael's consolidation of that power at the cost of his soul.  Robert DeNiro gives a stellar performance as Vito, and almost entirely in Italian!  His scenes are so rivetting, I really didn't care that I couldn't understand a word.In any other movie, Michael Corleone would be the villian.  As the main character, we don't have the luxury of seeing him as the 'bad-guy who must be stopped.'  Al Pacino portrays him with a Machivellian brilliance that kept me glued in front of the TV.This film's only flaw is that sometimes you don't want to switch from Vito to Michael because you're so wrapped up in what's going on.  However, any movie that gets you that interested in the characters definitely deserves a good recommendation!  I love this movie.",10,0,0,13 September 2000
American Psycho," The mind of the mindless...
","This movie had potential, except the main character is a total waste of time.  Malcolm McDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' was only about one thousand times more interesting.  Perhaps if he was obsessed with Beethoven, instead of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis...? (This next sentence may or may not be a spoiler.)  And, let's face facts here, the main character is a very, very stupid, boring, and pathetic man, who just happens to have violent fantasies and sleep around.  Most of the violence in the movie was off-camera, so I can't say it was really too graphic.  This is a really hard movie to pin down, because you know it is a satire, but there's no humor.  Compared to movies like 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Fight Club,' this movie fails miserably.",4,2,6,9 December 2000
American Beauty," Powerfully real.
","'American Beauty ' is not a movie.  It's a film.  It is literature in picture form. It is a documentation of a point in the progression of our society.  This film is a perfect snapshot of dysfunctional suburbia in the year 1999. (I will admit, Lester black-mailing his boss is not the most realistic thing that's ever happened in a film, but it fits the story if you understand why he's doing it.)  It is a modernization of Marxist-style alienation.  It is anti-materialism.  It is anti-conformity.  It's not a movie based on historical lies like 'Gone With the Wind.'  It's not a movie based on feeling good, like 'Forrest Gump.'   It's not a movie based on pseudo-mythology, like 'Star Wars.'  (All of those were excellent films, but ultra-unrealistic.) 'American Beauty' is based on the dark side of your own friends and neighbors.  The characters in it are not good people.  They don't 'save the day' in the end.  They live trapped in a prison of their own making.  They spend most of the time making each other miserable.  To say that 'American Beauty' is depressing misses the point.  The film works because it is emotionally powerful.  The only moral is that life is short, and to be grateful that you're alive.",9,0,0,29 August 2000
The Patriot," Mel Gibson saves another bad movie.
","If anyone but Mel Gibson made this movie, it might have been universally hailed as a needlessly violent, predictable epic.  Nothing about the story should surprise anyone.  Fortunately, Gibson and his co-stars make this lame bloodbath of a movie watchable.  The strength of this movie is its characters.  They seem grounded in their times, but we can still relate to them.  But this film does suffer from a cookie-cutter story that could have been written by a high school sophomore studying the American Revolution in his or her history class.  Nothing particularly interesting happens except a lot of killing.  I mean a LOT of killing.  As for the point of the movie...I couldn't see one.  Unless your a Gibson fan, don't waste your time.  Go see GLADIATOR again.",5,0,1,20 July 2000
54," I liked Mike Meyers.
","Ryan Phillipe plus Selma Hayek...did this movie stand a chance?  AND Neve Campbell?  It must be really easy to get a job as a casting director anymore. This movie is partially based on a true story.  THAT part of the movie was good.  Mike Meyers is clearly a good actor.  (You gotta admit, the guy who brought Wayne Campbell AND Austin Powers to life must have something going for him, even if you didn't like those movies.)  The whole 'downfall of Studio 54' would have been a good movie by itself, but THEY JUST HAD TO add the other idiot characters. Despite Meyers' talent, this movie is a pale shadow of 'The Last Days of Disco' and 'Boogie Nights' (the other entries in what I call the 'Death of the 70's' genre...if there are other movies in this category, please let me know).",5,0,1,5 January 2001
Pearl Harbor," Bad Script, Great Action
","The script for Pearl Harbor is bad.  Really bad.  The characters' dialogue barely comes close to believable, speaking mostly in cliche and soundbites. The plot is full of every war movie plot device you've probably seen before (since this movie is about a subject that has been covered many times before, that's almost excusable).  The only characters worth caring about were the lame secondary ones, and the love story is totally worthless. But, as an action movie, 'Pearl Harbor' delivers breathtaking sequences that will keep your eyes glued to the screen.  The attack on Pearl Harbor itself was quite exciting.  Michael Bay's break-neck directing style works better on these scenes than on the rest of the film. Overall, 'Pearl Harbor' wasn't a total waste of time (although it could've stood to be an hour shorter).  It was no 'Tora Tora Tora,' but not too bad a movie.",5,0,0,24 June 2001
Black Hawk Down," I watched the whole thing.
","I watched the whole thing.  Never once did I dissect the camera work.  Never once did I count the number of bullets hitting Somalians and compare them to the number of bullets hitting Americans.  I sat in my chair for the entire length of the film...and couldn't take my eyes off of it.  BLACK HAWK DOWN was not about characters.  It was not about the entirety of what happened the entire time the U.S. occupied the country.  This movie was about one incident from that conflict.  This movie told that story very well.  Ridley Scott does an excellent job orchestrating how the story is told, and has made a great film.",8,0,0,27 January 2002
Titanic," The highest grossing film ever deserves every penny.
","This is the movie with EVERYTHING.  If you have not seen this movie, you're missing out on a unique experience.  What I liked best about this movie is that every time I watch it I feel like I'm there with the characters, and that those characters are real people (some actually were). This movie does have one flaw.  There are points in the movie where the dialogue becomes rather corny.  However, this can also work to the film's advantage to make you believe that it is taking place in a more naive time.",8,0,2,7 September 1999
Bring It On," Funny eye candy.
","'Bring It On' is the kind of movie where you walk into the theater knowing about everything that's going to happen.  It is a very unoriginal film.  I still managed to turn off my brain and enjoy it for the following reasons: (1) Kirsten Dunst is a good actress, and she's also very cute. (Unfortunately, she keeps finding herself in movies that don't show off the full range of her talents.  This is one of them.) (2) Eliza Dushku is also good in this, although she's basically playing the same character she always plays. (3) It's funny!  There's some really amusing moments and dialogue in this movie.  Which is a plus, since (as many of the people who've reviewed this film seem to have forgotten) IT'S A COMEDY. (There's some PG-13-worthy jokes, but nothing too bad.) (4) Good choreography.  I liked watching the dance numbers. (5) Eye candy...'nuff said. Sure this movie has all the common elements, such as the goofy romance, the moral lesson, the stereotypical characters, but it still works.  Both the opening scene and the credit cookies (a combination of dancing and outtakes) are particularly hilarious. (Although, I will agree any comparison to 'Rocky' is a mistake.)",6,0,0,25 August 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," You're insane if you don't like this movie.
","Two words: Flawless masterpiece.  While not the greatest movie ever made, it should certainly rank extremely high.  Unless you're completely repulsed by the idea of a prison film, or if you're too immature to appreciate good drama, you're going to absolutely love, love, love this film.  This film was largely overlooked at the time because of the mega-popular 'Forrest Gump' (an extremely excellent film in its own right), but it holds up because of a timeless quality that very few films possess (I know the film's only 7 years old, but I think that's long enough).  If you're uncomfortable with some of the more graphic themes of the movie, it's still worth a look (certain cable networks regularly show an edited for TV version of the movie).  This is a must see for anyone who calls themselves a film-buff.",10,0,0,16 May 2001
Blow," Two words: 'Goodfellas 2'
","Imagine the classic gangster film 'Goodfellas,' except without the colorful characters or memorable dialogue.  Then replace all the robbery and drug dealing with just drug dealing and you're left with 'Blow.'  Same premise, same style, and it even has Ray Liota.  I've always said, if you're going to rip off a movie, rip off a good one. Johnny Depp is good actor, and his portrayal of  George Jung has warmth, depth, and sincerity.  Unfortunately, he's forced to carry the movie since no one else is given that much material to work with.  Most of the other characters never quite seem like real people. This movie's saving grace is Jung's relationship with his daughter.  He wants to go straight for her, but all he knows is drug dealing.  Eventually his 'profession' costs him even her.  It also does a good job recreating the feel of the time periods it visits, although the non-stop soundtrack of older songs does get tiresome. 'Blow' isn't a bad movie, but it lacks a lot of elements that would have made it a film on the same level as other crime dramas of recent years.",6,3,4,21 April 2001
Blade Runner," Slow-paced and Dull, BLADE RUNNER Is All Looks
","I trying hard to understand why Ridley Scott's 1982 'classic' BLADE RUNNER has such a lofty reputation.  True, the special effects were outstanding for 1982.  Okay, I'll admit it, the effects were even good by today's standards. Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast give good performances.  There were quite a few things to like.  Unfortunately this movie suffers because it basically has 45 minutes of plot stretched out into two hours.  There are LONG gaps between dialogue.  Quite a bit of screen time is given just looking at the scenery (which, while impressive, gets tiresome after you've seen the same thing 3 or 4 times).  The grim future depicted in this film has served as a visual inspiration to many science fiction movies released in the last 20 years (The Fifth Element, A.I., and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones come to mind), but that alone is not enough reason to declare the film a classic.",5,2,6,1 June 2002
The Truman Show," A great parody of TV and voyeurism.
","I was originally reluctant to watch this film  since I thought the trailer/advertisements gave away too much.  When I did eventually see it, I was very impressed by what wasn't in the commercials.  This film has a lot of quiet charm, due not only to Jim Carrey's performance, but also to the subtle, serene way the story flows to it's conclusion.  'The Truman Show' isn't a big sprawling epic, with big characters and big events, but a simple movie about a man who is slowly discovering his life is a lie.  There's no real suspense, since the audience already knows the truth.  But, this is not a suspense movie, it is a satire of reality.  Given the popularity of TV shows like 'Survivor' and 'The Real World,' 'The Truman Show' speaks volumes about the American obsession with voyeurism.  This is the best parody of television since 'Network.'",9,0,0,12 September 2000
Gladiator," The movie is way over-rated!
","Several excellent action sequences and a strong performance by Russell Crowe can not make up for a movie that's too long.  The excitement of the film is front loaded, and all the interesting points of the film are exhausted by the middle of the film.  A lot of time is wasted with countless redundant scenes establishing and re-establishing that (1) the new emperor is a spoiled insecure rodent, and (2) 'gee, things would sure be swell if Rome was a Republic again!'  The emperor's conspiring sister is played poorly by Connie Nielson, who couldn't act her way out of a high school play.  Joaquin Phoenix spends most of his time trying to pull off being demented but comes across just looking bitter. This movie is worth the money if you're looking for exciting fight scenes, but plan on making lots of trips to the concession stand during the dialogue scenes.  You can afford to miss them and still be able to figure out every single thing that's going on. *SPOILER WARNING* This film is total fiction, of course.  However, even in fiction there's a limit to believability.  For example, I hope the producers don't actually expect us to believe that after 25 years the emperor of Rome changes his mind about the morality of having an empire the day before he dies, or that the Roman Republic could have been restored in the second century by a single man!",6,0,0,6 May 2000
Contact," One of the greatest science fiction films EVER.
","This film's excellence is due to one thing: it effectively uses a its premise to explore a question of human nature.  Sure it has a great cast, dazzling effects, and a good story, but what this film really has going for it is its exploration of truth.  CONTACT successfully uses the film medium to explore questions of faith, religion, and science.I have heard this movie heavily criticized for its ending, but I would care to point out that the movie would not work symbolicly without the main character's journey ending the way it does.",9,0,1,7 September 1999
