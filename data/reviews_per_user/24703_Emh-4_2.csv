The Rock," Best action movie ever
","This movie is the best action movie I have ever seen, or probably will see. It's got great music, made by Hans Zimmer, Harry-Gregson Williams and Nick Glennie-Smith. This is THE action-score in my book! Great performances, good writing, character development, humor, and one of the best car chases ever. Great cinematography, great editing, great sound, the list goes on! Buy the Criterion Edition-DVD of this movie NOW! 10/10",10,3,3,28 May 2002
Toy Story 2," GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!
","Toy Story 2 is one of the best movies i have ever seen. It's really fun have lot's of references to other movies like Jurassic Park, a Star Wars spoof ('-I am your father! -Noo!!!'), and a whole bunch of other ones. But even if they took all the spoofs out of the movies, it still would be a really funny movie! The animation's great, and the opening scene is one of the best opening scenes in a movie ever! The characters are great, Buzz Lightyear is as cool as you would expect out of an really cool actiontoy (I'm going to get one as soon as i get the chance to), another great character is the hysteric toy dinosaur that complains about that he can't play TV-games properly because his arms are so short! Simply said this is a great movie!!!!Tip. Look for the blooper shots in the credits, they're really funny!",10,0,1,4 March 2000
