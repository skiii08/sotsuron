The Finest Hours," Excellent Film Full of Drama & Suspense
","A heroic film full of drama and suspense, had me on the edge of my chair the entire time. It's a story portraying an amazing rescue by a branch of the military, often overlooked, the Coast Guard. The film draws the viewer into the story from the very onset. I watched it twice, because I was so tense the first time, I thought I may have missed something. Each actor portrayed his character exceptionally and distinctly from the others. It was a good mix of personalities. The movie was overall outstanding, had realistic staging, special effects and cinematography. It gave me a new respect for our Coast Guard, not realizing the important part they play in protecting and rescuing Americans and that they do put themselves in harms way.",9,1,4,18 June 2016
Concussion," Great Story That Needed To Be Told
","It was simply refreshing to see the real life drama of a person who came to America to pursue the American Dream and did not compromise his principles, in spite of adversity and severe persecution. Hopefully, young people will watch this movie and aspire to the same kind of character. The star studded cast did an excellent job in portraying different characters in the cover up of one of the well guarded secrets of professional football. Will Smith, portraying Dr. Omalu, an immigrant to America with a zillion college degrees draws the audience into his search for truth and the steadfast desire to make it known. Even if you don't love football or even watch it, you will love this true to life movie. Great acting + great script + great direction = A Great Movie & you can still enjoy it. You may even know someone that has played football and can come to appreciate how difficult a sport it can be, by watching this movie. We do. My brother-in-law played for the 49ers and as we watched, we knew exactly what all the fuss what about.",8,1,3,18 June 2016
Trouble with the Curve," One Of My All Time Favorites
","Great story, characters, and star studded cast. Without giving anything away it's an awesome Baseball movie. The storyline is an aged, scout whose eyesight is failing. His 'estranged' daughter (who is up for a promotion in her law firm) realizes he can't make a car trip alone to follow a potential candidate (a super hitter) for his baseball club.",9,0,0,19 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," This Movie Was A Major Disappointment
",Multiple storylines come together at the end. I'm surprised that Brad Pitt would do a film such as this. It is C-rated at best.,3,6,12,7 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Expected So Much More
","Because of the cast we expected so much more of this movie. Actually, the cast played their parts well and it was an interesting storyline, but there were major deficiencies. The script and direction made the movie difficult to follow. It was choppy and didn't move smoothly. It wasn't until we were more than halfway through the movie that I realized the story was based on life events that took place in the 60's (which I was a college student). I don't recommend this movie.",3,4,13,7 August 2019
La La Land," A Modern Day Musical
","There are many musicals that fall into my 'Favorites' category and this is definitely one of them. For a Director to take two actors that have no singing or dancing experience, however a dynamic chemistry with each other, made it work. The opening scene immediately draws the audience in with a snappy, amazing musical number on an LA freeway! This number was worth the Theater tickets! As the storyline develops in the lives of these two people, both struggling artists in different industries we are pulling for them both to find success and an enduring relationship. If you haven't seen this yet, (what are you waiting for?) go and enjoy; you will laugh and cry (which definitely makes up a good movie. Right? We've seen it at least five times and will probably again (we grew up on Musicals).",9,6,7,20 March 2018
Titanic," Titanic- An Epic Movie
","Titanic falls in the Epic Category along with movies such as 'Gone With the Wind', 'Pearl Harbor', and 'BEN Hur, to name a few. Period costumes, set design, believable characters incorporated to share a story of what could have happened on that fateful night. We just wanted to watch it again since it had been awhile.",10,2,4,3 February 2019
There Will Be Blood," Worst Movie I've Ever Seen
","The Movie rating was very high and that's why we turned it on. But as we watched, I kept thinking, 'There must be a point to this movie.' It's extremely violent, crude, sickening and wasted an entire four hours of my time. I'm warning the viewer, Don't waste yours! I've never given this kind of review before. If I could, I would give it a 0!",1,0,5,4 June 2020
The Nice Guys," I Can't Believe These Actors Made This Movie!!!!
","It's not even stupid humor. It's just plain STUPID, unimaginative, a horrible script. Couldn't even get half way through it.",2,1,6,4 May 2020
