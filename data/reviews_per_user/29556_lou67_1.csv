The Ring," If you disagree with me start up a message board
","OK so here are my comments, what was was so damn scary about this movie? I thought the scariest part for me was that I paid 7 dollars to see it and not only did I see it once but twice(second time on a date) well OK it starts out really good, great scary account of the girl being found in the closet but then it's like hours of people wandering around like Michael Jackson looking for a small child, I mean c'mon it's so hard to find a movie thats really scary these days, Sixth Sense had some of it, Blair Witch definately did the job, but the greats in my opinion follow the same principal mess with your audiances' collective head, throw in a creepy make uped person once in awhile and you go gold, but this it was like c'mon, so far we had the video was creepy, the closet scene and the end was kinda creepy but I was so bored with impatience I blurted to my friend, 'if some woman came outta my tv I'd be like, 'hey you get in the kitchen and make me some pie' I mean great concept guys, I'm really looking forward to Ringu but next time give us some midway chills, not just oh I have a nose bleed and fly came out of the TV and now I'm pulling things out of my throat, I want to be scared now bored.",Null,2,5,14 July 2003
