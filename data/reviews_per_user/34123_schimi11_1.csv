Sucker Punch," Struggling to become The BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!
","I,m not sure who and why rated this masterpiece so bad, I guess it's just that you either love it or hate it...but the movie has everything and is for everyone. You just have to let yourself go in it and enjoy. Well, half naked and attractive girls kicking ass, dance, strip; fantastic music, flawlessly directed fight scenes, drama, sadness, true nature of man who is just evil and one good girl is giving all to beat it. With every viewing you get something new, cause it's hard to understand it fully. But that's the beauty of it, the story behind of another story, dream within a dream and it's all wrapped up in a box which is made to entertain and teach you something. That's what movies are for, and that's why I love it!!",10,25,46,25 March 2013
