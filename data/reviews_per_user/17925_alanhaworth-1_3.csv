United 93," Moving beyond all expectations
","Tonight as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival I attended a screening of 'United 93'. I was moved by this film in a way no other film has ever moved me. Having had only a scant knowledge of the events surrounding the fourth hijacked plane on that fateful September 11th, the film portrayed so graphically the horrors faced by those poor souls who died on this flight, that I felt almost as if I was there with them - right the way to the tragic end. I do not recall ever leaving a cinema and observing so many other theatre goers who were wiping away tears, and looking as stunned and emotionally 'wrung out' as I felt myself tonight. To see theatre ushers comforting one another as they sobbed (male and female) openly, and partners locked in supportive embrace while also crying unashamably in public, is a sight I have never encountered following the screening of a film. The impact was so great I am still reeling an hour later, my thoughts, a mixture of sadness and sorrow. For me the 'alarm bells' are ringing, and the question I have been asking myself for the past hour is this .... If organised religion means acts such as this can be justified, then isn't it time to rid ourselves of such institutions, and to seek faith on a personal and private level? No god could sanction such acts against humanity. I defy anyone with an ounce of compassion not to be effected in some way by 'United 93'.",10,3,6,28 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Depp's Captain Jack is back
","A miserable winter's day in Melbourne Australia has just received the 'rays' required to warm the cockles of this city's heart! Johnny Depp has arrived to deliver another dose of pure entertainment in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. The story is strong, the visuals are great, the rest of the cast is as strong as in the original ... but above all else, there's one major reason for this film and its predecessor's success ... JOHNNY DEPP. If Depp is not thoroughly enjoying every single moment of playing this character, then he is the greatest actor of all-time. His antics, from the swishing of his pirate hips, to the mischievous glint in his eye, all make the film a joy to behold. For those in need of a really good laugh, and a voyage full of fantasy and fun, then set sail now for a ride on the Black Pearl - you will not regret it.",9,1,4,6 July 2006
The Da Vinci Code," A 98% faithful-to-the-book film adaptation
","As one who thoroughly enjoyed Dan Brown's novel, I was both excited and hesitant, as I entered the cinema, on my first of three viewings. How often do the screen versions of books disappoint? Far too often. But Ron Howard is a credible guy (who wouldn't trust Ritchie Cunningham?), so hopefully he will have seen the need to leave the story 'as is'. Remarkably Howard has almost pulled off the exact replication of the book on the screen in this masterpiece. Time prevented some of the detail (which begs the question ... Do those who have not read the book, follow the plot easily, if at all?). The tampering with the book's ending has added some (unnecessary, I believe) 'Hollywood Corn' to the events in Scotland, but we can overlook this when considering the 'whole package'. In its entirety the film literally 'blew me away'. How many times had I almost convinced myself prior to seeing the film, that Tom Hanks is not how I imagine Robert Langdon? How soon after the film begun did I realise Tom Hanks is perfect as Langdon (hope he signs on for 'Angels and Demons')? Sir Ian is everything Teebing should be, and deserves the Supporting Actor Award for this performance. The production has a majestic quality about it. Every scene a work of pure cinematic art. Howard will also hopefully return to direct 'Angel and Demons' - he can be trusted! If you are open-minded, and enjoy a thought provoking plot, then this is a 'must see'. If you are troubled by challenges to religious doctrine and beliefs, then perhaps this is a film you avoid.",9,1,2,29 June 2006
