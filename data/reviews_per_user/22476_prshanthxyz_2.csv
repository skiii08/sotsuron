Blade Runner 2049," Good attempt, but nothing unique
","It's wrong to say this sequel was unnecessary but, the only reason it succeeded at the BOX office is because: The first was a good movie but many years back (and many people have only watched/appreciate the new movie).
Dragging Harisson Ford back as an old man wasn't very creative, although, it does add to the impact of the movie.Please don't do another sequel; not even 100 years later.
And, its a bad depiction of 2049- Thank god there were no aliens.",9,0,5,9 January 2018
To Kill a Mockingbird," Peculiar but worthy even in 2018
","The movie is one among few that capture people in their routine at a time in America that people now hardly recollect. The way it captures racism and white supremacy, people standing up for equality, the notion of the white American and most of this through the eyes of a young curious girl is unique indeed. However the film at various points lacks clarity. This maybe an indication of the equipment those days. I haven't seen a remastered edition.",8,1,2,13 August 2018
