The Ring," Good but not perfect
",It's a good tension but after the scenes you are realizing that it was in vain. Good scenario but it's unnecessary to think that I will be in a hurry to die after 7 days :)Good cast but perfect with NAOMI WATTS...At the end the scenario is summing up well but copying the tapes is a bit strange. Make-up is so good but I could not understand why the victims were like the zombies. It was made to give a horror mood to the onlookers. I think planning more interesting and creative deaths was impossible.To sum up the movie deserves to be seen by millions of people but can be much better.,8,0,0,6 October 2004
Saw," Nobody can guess!!!!
","I heard about this film by my friends. They told me that it is the most successful horror film they have ever seen for year but I was not so hopeful. I was not hopeful because I have never seen the actors in a horror film before. Now I agree with my friends. It is the best in the horrors and it is the best scenario. Actors are not popular but they were perfect. Especially the scene which the doctor was cutting his own leg was very very realistic. I was surprised with his acting and the make up (white face)I am very pretentious that even if someone watched all the horror film, cannot guess the end of the SAW.",10,1,2,8 March 2005
