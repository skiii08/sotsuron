The Blair Witch Project," if you only go to see hyped movies and watch MTV, you are a follower and will not like this movie.
","When I first heard of this movie (before any hype) I was really looking forward to seeing it.  When a movie has a 30K budget you can't afford cute little WB/FOX actresses, a wimpy 90's rock soundtrack, or computer generated special effects.  And do you know what you need to compensate for that? CREATIVITY!!!!  What a concept. The use of 8mm footage merely enhances the mood of this movie. If you consider Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer a horror movie, and you don't know the difference between being startled and the feeling of genuine fear/terror, you don't even deserve to watch this movie.  If you look forward to audience wisecracks and laughing during a 'horror' movie, you don't know what a horror movie is.  However, if you have even a shred of intelligence and are a willing participant, this movie will strip you down to some very primal emotions that are not experienced very often these days.  Try to go to this movie alone, and with as little audience as possible.  This is not a social movie.  There will be no laughs when the director wants terror.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
