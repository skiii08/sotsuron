Alien 3," A great movie, despite what people say...
","I'm a huge fan of the Alien series as a whole. I have the nine-DVD box set, along with Alien vs Predator, and the special editions of both Predator films. The first time I saw Alien 3, I was a kid, and I thought it was the worst of the three films (this was before there was a fourth film). There was virtually no real action and a lot of boring talk. Over the years my taste in movies has become more sophisticated, and with it I watched as a beautifully crafted masterpiece emerged from Alien 3. Watching it now, it has a well-written story with complex characters who exhibit true personality. Albeit, if you are looking for a super shoot-out with the alien baddies, this film is not for you. The story telling in this film is more of an dramatic art form than a typical action/horror flick. Alien was a good film for everyone, and kids are bound to pick Aliens or Alien Resurrection as their favorite, but it takes an adult's intellect to truly appreciate the complex story that is Alien 3.",10,2,9,25 October 2006
