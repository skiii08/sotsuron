Casablanca," Casablanca
","Humphrey Bogart plays an amazing character as Rick Blaine in this film. He is a mysterious business man who 's character you fall in love with. This movie had a great exotic feel to it. All the different countries of the world came together in Casablanca. The actors really portrayed each culture very well with they're accents and costumes. The rest of the costumes for the movie were well done also. I loved how Humphrey Bogart was always looking as classy as possible with his suits and bow-tie. The music was very cool in this film as well, especially the character Sam who played for Rick in the saloon. He was really talented. The middle eastern singers and musicians in the bar also helped to give the movie this exotic feeling that worked really well.",8,0,1,14 October 2014
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","This film is a Cinematic masterpiece and is told like a beautiful dramatic poem. This is the feel we get from the narrating of the main character played by Robert De Niro. This movie is shot so elegant and dramatically right from the opening scene. We start out in this brilliant long cut that gives us a first person drive through New York City in a taxi. The blurry rainy streets of the city at night were portrayed so well in these scenes.The Music gives this movie a real old style new york feel as well, with the class orchestral music constantly breaking up the scenes. Even the opening credits had such great lighting and special effects. The way this film give us a look through the mind of our main character and makes the viewer feel a part of the film is its greatest accomplishment. There are so many beautifully dramatic long takes as we zone out with the main character and the camera wanders along with his eyes giving us the feel of seeing exactly what our protagonist sees and feels.",8,0,1,7 December 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath
",The Grapes of Wrath really had a great message to get across to America. This movie is full of political and social meaning. Its a very emotion packed film taking place during the depression in the 1930's. THis movie is till very much relevant to this day in its economic message to a struggling country. This film touches your heart and you truly feel for the poor farmers. This movie had great cultural significance but is not aesthetically pleasing. The acting and dialog are shaky and do not keep you interested. I would find myself straying off because some of the rants seemed irrelevant. The whole film has a gloomy feel to it.,3,5,12,15 October 2014
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","I thought this film was very pleasing to the eyes and had a great message that can some what relate to everyones love life. At some point in our lives we have all been Alvy Singerand i think thats why this movie is so appreciated by many. However Woody Allen is way to much of a personality actor for me. While his humor certainly has its moments and can get me to laugh pretty hard, it becomes old and stagnant throughout this film. Woody Allen is strongly opinionated and he makes it clear by force feeding his thoughts about society to you countless times in his films. It almost feels like getting stuck at a stand up act that you didn't sign up to go see. Another thing that held this film back was purely the amount of times he steps out of character and acknowledges that this is a film. I think thats a clever method in film making and can be hilarious, however this technique was beat to death in this film.",5,0,1,7 December 2014
The Graduate," The Graduate
","This film surprised me in so many ways. This movie was so beautifully shot with its crisp colored scenes and amazing widescreen format. There was so many creative personal perspective shots where we are taken in to the mind of Benjamin Braddock , played by the brilliant Dustin Hoffman. His performance was what made this film , something somewhat necessary you would hope out of your main character. His performance was so awkwardly hilarious , her truly captured the persona of the post college young buck with hesitation to perfection. Right along side him Anne Bancrofft, Mrs. Robinson, was sensational as well. I think this film was comedically ahead of it time and set the tone for plenty of our greatest modern comedies such as American Pie(1999) and such films in that genre.",8,0,0,4 December 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain
","This movie is a colorful up beat type of musical. This film is full of classic tunes that they will have stuck in your head for the rest of the week. However some songs and dance sequences can drag on and seem a bit dramatic.Speaking of dragging out I feel that is all the ending was , a big drawn out symphony of dance and song that didn't seem to fit or really feel necessary. The title song is popularized in a more recent film a Clock Work Orange(1971), and having seen that film first i think gave me the wrong preconceived feeling about the song maybe causing me to enjoy it less in this film. However this film definitely leaves your foot tapping and has its own type of hilarity in its dance routines.",6,0,0,4 December 2014
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction
","This is hands down one of the most interesting films you will ever watch. It earns an easy spot on almost all top movie lists. There is never a dull moment in a Tarantino film and this movie comes through with a crazy amount of plot twist as he has done in so many other great films. This movie will filled with power packed cast that all really delivered. This film is witty,gory, and yet still can warm your heart at times. This movie has so many memorable quotes mainly due tot the superb acting job by the always great Samuel L. Jackson. The action is off the charts and this film is full of Tarantino's typical gory and dramatic cinematic effects. Tarantino is truly one of the masters of expressing realistic violence on film. This movie is a bit confusing the first time through but after you grasp whats going on and how this story is being haphazardly told to you it is one of the most thrilling cinematic experiences. This mish-moshed story telling is common for a Tarantino. It would not even be fair to label this movie in a genre because this movie does so much. It takes you on a ride through every emotion and movie genre you can imagine. A true masterpiece.",9,0,1,7 December 2014
Psycho," Psycho
","This is a wonderfully made horror classic that laid the ground work for the slasher movies of our time, which have become so common. This film is filled with creepy in-harmonic sounds that we have becomes so used to in horror and suspenseful films. The build up in the suspenseful scenes really have feeling uncomfortable. Hitchcock knows how to get his viewers on the edge of their seat and we see that in full effect in this masterpiece. This film is one of the greatest written story lines and has such a fantastic dialog. This is an art that has been completely lost in our modern genre of 'horror'. Character's seem to have no depth and the killing takes priority over the plot in our more recent slasher type films. Psycho has done so much for the genre of horror. Horror movies need to step up their game because this film set a crazy high standard in 1960 that may not have been toped.",9,2,3,8 December 2014
