Requiem for a Dream," Important message,weak movie
","'May contain a spoiler'The message of the film is that addiction is bad and can lead to your destruction and it doesn't matter if you are addicted to prescription drugs or to illegal ones. This is an important message and the way to the destruction is conveyed in a very impressive way. You first get a glimpse at the 'good side' of the heroes addiction and afterwards you watch them on their way to hell. But the characters remain one dimensional and at the end of the film you don't know more than you knew about them in the beginning of the film and the fact that they are basically pursuing their dream is not enough to explain their motivations and actions. Ellen Burstyn carry the film on her shoulders and do her best with what she got in the first place,which is not much.An important message is been carried by a weak film.",7,4,8,4 February 2001
United 93," Faithful
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*This is a reconstruction of the events, which happened on 9/11 focusing on what happened on Untied Airlines 93 flight. The film enjoy the fact that director & writer Paul Greengrass has decided to approach this film in a style that is combined of documentary and feature film. This approach is support with the fact he has used some of the real people playing themselves in the film. This lend the film some of its strongest point. One can only imagine how difficult it was for these people to re-live the events of 9/11. Anther point of strength is the use of unfamiliar faces to play the passengers and crew of United 93. This decision has kept the story in focus and you are not distract by the actors. The story is faithful to the facts(as much as possible) and there is no trying in making it end differently than it has been, while in the course of the film you wish it has been different(in real, not in the film). The film give you a punch in the stomach and leave you breathless and do this effectively in only 91 minutes.In one line: A film to see.",9,2,4,22 July 2006
Meet the Parents," Nothing bad to say
","I enjoyed the film very much,and I didn't noticed how fast the time flew because of my enjoyment.I laughed,a lot.The performances are good especially Stiller and De Niro(who's approach to comedy is as serious as one can expect from him). The only thing I didn't like is the happy ending but that's what you get in a romantic comedy.Go and see what happen when a comedy is good and make you laugh as a comedy should",8,0,0,10 January 2001
Unbreakable," Uneven
","'This review may contain a spoiler'First a complaint to the marketing peoples at 'Disney'. Presenting the film as a sequel to 'The Sixth Sense' is a big mistake because everyone expect something like that film and when they don't get that they become disappointed with the product.Now that I said that to the film, which I enjoyed very much. I liked the slow pace of the film. I liked the fact That M. Night Shyamalan took its time to tell the story and I found myself relating to the story very much and here is the second problem of the film. If you want to enjoy it you have to accept and believe in some of the things it tells you. i.e: that the world is a place where good and evil fight each other,all the time,that everyone needs hope in a world that have little hope to offer,in order to keep on living. If you can accept what the film says you will enjoy it more,if not than you will not like the film at all. I had also problem with one of the scenes and I'm talking about the scene where Joseph Dunn (Spencer Treat Clark) try to shoot his father David (Bruce Willis). The scene was ridiculous and everyone involved were acting over the top which was not in tune with the rest of the film. Bruce Willis & Samuel L. Jackson were excellent and the interaction with one another was superb.I recommend this film though it's not a perfect one, and again ignore the fact that it's been marketed as a sequel.This is a completely different film.April 2007:The review above has been written 6 or 7 years ago.I have just watched the film again and I can not believe I have liked it.This is a very pretentious film.A much a do about nothing.Characters who talk and act in clichÃ©s.A script full of holes and a film which is shot in the wrong angles. The kid is simply irritating.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Just show you that some films do not stand well the signs of time.",1,15,32,29 January 2001
Memento," Original,interesting,intriguing
","'May contain a spoiler'Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) can't hold any new memory ever since his wife was rape and murdered before his own eyes and he is seeking revenge in order 'to get his life back'. The story is nothing new, however the way the story is told is so refreshing that the story doesn't matter any more. Instead of telling the story from a the start, the director Christopher Nolan decided to tell the story backwards and through the eyes of Leonard Shelby. In that way he manage to get our attention because we see the story as Shelby see it and as Shelby, we don't have a clue to what happened before and we have to watch the film close in order to get all the details, and yet by the end I was left with the feeling that I missed something and questioned my own memory and was doubting whether I understood the film and really saw everything.So here is a film who deals with the subject of memory and truth and eventually make the audience doubt his own memory and what he perceive as the truth. The whole film is like a puzzle and the end doesn't give you the satisfaction of solving it.On the contrary. By the end you get another version to the events which seems as possible as what we saw before.Technically speaking this is simply a superb film. If I understand correctly Nolan has shoot the movie the way it is been told(ie: backwards) which means that someone had to follow every detail so it will be accurate. I don't think I have seen any mistakes in the details. But technicality is not the only thing that stand out in this movie. The acting is brilliant. Guy Pearce shows that LA Confidential was not a one time achievement and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy is in good form and give the right balance to Pearce's character. I also liked the way San-Francisco is portrayed here,not as a big city with a lot of people but rather like a city in the middle of nowhere.I highly recommend this film to anyone who find himself bored from films which carry so much cliché and want to see something original. In this film they will find originality which at the same time keep us interested in what's going on.Simply go and see.",10,0,1,22 April 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Long,boring and chaotic.
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*When a sequel is coming for a successful film you can be sure that on one thing. The makers of the film will do their best to milk out the success of the original. This film is no different. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and film distributor Walt Disney, have done that to the maximum. On it's way to the financial success of this film they managed to take any freshness from the first film and left us with one boring, long and chaotic film. Everything that was working to the advantage of the 1st film has become a disadvantage of this sequel. The characters are as shallow as the sea level after the high tide(and when you see they are credits for 4 writers for characters, one can wonder what were they paid for). The jokes are not working. The action sequences are too long and make the film longer than it actually is. Its 150 minutes playing time seems like eternity. You want the film to end but had to endure more and more of this nonsense. The script is full of holes and can be summarised in one sentence(as 2 of the characters do, somewhere in the film). The script and therefore the film has no logic and serve only as a point to promote the Disney's attraction its based upon. The film doesn't even try to explain why some of the things happened it basically says: That is how it is, live with it. You want logic, look somewhere else. The open ending(and not only ending-some plot-lines remain unresolved) suggest that this film is a long exposition for the 3rd installment of this franchise(logic when you know that part 2 en 3 were filmed simultaneously).In 2 sentences: A waist of time and money. Ignore this film and you will be rewarded.",1,9,14,22 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," disappointing
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I have read the book far too long ago to make any comment if this one a good adaptation or not. I do remember that the book was full of magic and at time I have read the book several times. I can only say that I didn't like the film as I was missing the magic. Something was missing and I found myself cold and detached when watching this film and it came as a surprise because the trailer was quite promising(a proof that one should watch trailers very cautiously).The technical aspect of the film is also not perfect. In some of the scenes you can see that it has been filmed with blue screen(and for a film which relay on special effects, that is a big miss). Some of the performances are not apt for the task. Especially William Moseley & Anna Popplewell ( respectively: Peter & Susan Pevensie). Their acting is dead wooden and do not bring the characters to live. If any thing save the film from a total disaster it is the performances of Skandar Keynes(Edmund Pevensie) & Georgie Henley(Lucy Pevensie). Their characters are well played and are convincing. The best performance comes from Tilda Swinton(White Which), who give a new meaning for the say: 'you are as cold as ice'. When ever she is on screen the chill and icy tone made me feel freezing(and in need of a cup of warm chocolate).I am sure children will love the film. Adults who have fond memories from the book may be much more disappointed. Shame we have to endure another 6 adaptation of these books.",4,1,3,31 January 2006
Madagascar," The trailer was more than enough(again)
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*The trailer was tempting but the film itself was disappointing. All the good jokes were in the trailer and if you have seen it, you should know you have seen more than enough. The same happened with Shark Tale and it is very alarming that this happens 2nd time in a row to Dream Works SKG.The film run fast, no doubt and is very short, which is a very big plus. However most of the jokes do not work and there are very few hilarious moments. The theme of friendship above all is taken directly from a Disney film and should have stayed there. I am quite tired of the messages that are inserted in such films. We have seen it, heard it and had enough of it.The only thing that have worked for me in the film(and therefore raised its score to 4 out of 10) is the use of the soundtrack. If you know where the music come from you will appreciate the usage of it here. Beside that it is a waste of money. Wait for the DVD it will cost you less.",4,0,2,9 July 2005
Billy Elliot," A feel good movie
","I liked this movie. It made me laugh and eventually made me cry a little. It deals with everything from how we deal with the death of a close one to how we let him go. It also deals with achieving our ambitions against the backdrop of an hostile environment. In short it deals with everything we go through in our lives and do it good. Jamie Bell is excellent as the hero and so is everyone else, though I found Julie Walters a little bit irritating. The story itself shift well between Billy Elliot and the backdrop story of the miners strikes in England in 1984. The rhythm of the film is good and it is helped by the music of that period.One last thing. Is the film a gay one or not? The makers of the film left it deliberately vague. There are some hints that Billy is gay and there are some hints which contradict this assumption. It definitely in the eye of the beholder and any interpretation can be correct. The reason that many see Billy as gay is because he is an outsider and has to deal with an hostile surroundings,a feeling many gay peoples can identify with. Whether he is gay or not, is not important to the fact that this is a movie that make you feel good.Go see the movie,you will not regret.",8,0,0,12 March 2001
The Others," A good ghost story
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*How do you describe a film enough to keep everyone interested and without telling to many details that will reveal too much and destroy it for others? Strange question to start a review with and yet and essential one when beginning to talk about this film.All I will say is  that the film is about Grace(Nicole Kidman) who lives with her 2 children, Anne(Alkina Mann) and Nicholas(James Bentley), in a remote house on Jeresy Island in the time after WWII. Her children are suffering from a rare disease that make exposure to light dangerous to them. One day Anne and later also Grace seem to hear strange voices and believe that the house is haunted and...You want to know what happened from now on, go and see the film. Telling you what happens now will deprive you from one of the film which will be remembered from 2001/2002. Because this a film to see and remember. It is good because at the end it make you think about a lot of things. Relations between parents and children. Trust and believe between those 2 parts of the family. Acceptance of things in your life. In a more philosophic level it says something about our perspective and the way we see things. How we take everything for granted while we shouldn't.Kidman is excellent(2nd time this year with a strong part) and seem to be improving every time I watch her. The children and the rest of the cast are also good and complete the strong ensemble which help the movie. The direction is good and is helped by the lighting of the set and the score.All in all go and see the film. The twist somewhere in the film will make you and everyone else in the cinema jump. Recommended by all means.",8,4,5,18 January 2002
Brokeback Mountain," A must see film
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILER* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*There is very little to say about a film that generate so much reaction. There is little to add to previous positive reactions. I agree with them all. This is a movie that touch you and stay in your mind long after you have seen it. The acting is superb and while Heath Ledger(Enis Del Mare) is excellent, he could not have done it with out all the actors around him and especially Jake Gyllenhaal(Jack Twist). The cinematography is beautiful and serve the film exceptionally. The music is simple but sneak to your heart like the film itself. I think this is one of the rare occasions where a film have managed to describe the word LOVE or the feeling of LOVE without being schmaltz or predictable or even to use the words I love you(the line: 'I wish I knew how to quit you' is a classic quote-say to someone you love him with out uttering the word love) . One action can say more than a thousands words. Word can deceive you, actions do not.After saying the above I can only add some point or react to other comments and give my own point of view.For me the film starts slowly and I had difficulty getting into the story. Another difficulty for me, has been the fact that the film begins in what I can only describe as cliché way. But the clichés disappeared(as if director And Lee is saying: look beyond the clichés and see the people beyond the clichés) and by the end of the film I was caught with the characters and with the story. They and film itself have griped me in the heart and in the throat and didn't let go. There is no conciliation at the end nor there is a happy ending which can bring relief to the pain I have felt in me when the film end. Even the tears which were going down my cheek were tears of pain, not tears of comfort. The tears of comfort came several days later(but this is another story).Some people claim that the gay element of the story should be ignored and that people should only see this as a film with the universal theme of love. I simply don't agree with this notion. I don't believe that the film would have the same impact if the characters were a man and a woman. A man & a woman don't have to fear for their life when they are in love with each other, as Enis point out to Jake twice in the film. The feeling that Enis express in one point that he think that everyone know about him is a common feeling for gay men in the closet. In short, stop pretending it's not a GAY love story. It is, and there is no way to look around this point.The film treat the audience in the most respect. This is intelligence film making in its best. Director Ang Lee prefer mostly to hint about things than say them out open in the air. 3 examples come to my mind(although I am sure I can find some more). See how Lee show the passage of time. He does not use titles but use cloths, changes in appearance, music. Another point is how he show us how the encounter with Jake is more significant to Enis than he wish to admit. The 1st scene which come to mind is the one right after Enis & Jake come down from Brokeback Mountain and after parting Enis break into tears. This is an heart breaking scene. It show you with no words that Enis know that he had something special which he had never known before and may never know after. And he wants it so much. The 2nd scene is the sex scene with Alma. At a certain moment he turn her over and take her from behind.Without words you can understand that he wants to recapture the intimacy he had with Jake and for him this will be the only way he can get intimate or relive the experience.I can go on and on talking about this film. I don't think I have enough space to say all I want to say. I will summarize by saying that this is a film that has became an instant classic and will be quoted and analysed in future to come. As with classic films, it will be parodied(I have seen already 2 on the internet and there are more to come).It is a film that will affect anyone who watch him. You can not stay indifferent to this film. Audience in general will be moved by the film. Gay audience will appreciate the respect the film shows to his characters. For the first time in many year Gay men are not treated as freaks or as buffoons but as people who need to overcome obstacles in the course of finding love and be loved.In short. Go and see the film. It worth every penny or Dollar(or any other currency you use) you will pay for it.",10,26,30,20 February 2006
X-Men," Visually stunning and very enjoyable
","'This review nay contain spoilers'. From the first moment you watch the movie you get caught in it, visually. It catch your eyes and never let you go. I was very happy with the approach the film has, which reminded me of the one 'Batman'(1&2) had, which means that although the film is based on a comics book it's not necessarily has to be silly and aimed for children.This is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie but it's not flawless.A lot of things are simply left unexplained. For example: why and how the 'bad mutants' joined Magnet and not Prof. X? or the fact that Mistuiqe manage to pose as one of the boys in Prof.X school and no one seems to notice there are 2 of them, and I can point out some more things like this. However I admit that maybe it's better to leave it as it is, because if you ignore these things you cab enjoy the film more.I also think that while the good Mutants are more 2 dimension the bad ones remain in one dimension. One last thing. A sequel is unavoidable, let's just hope that Fox will retain the same approach as in this film and will not try to cash on it and by that destroy it as WB has done with the 'Batman' films(3&4). Go see this movie it probably the best summer blockbuster you'll ever see this year",9,0,0,18 November 2000
Match Point," Woody Allen's best film in years
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILER* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*This film see Woody Allen return to form. After years of filming the same film over and over(and with less and less success), Allen moves to London (as a result of difficulties in finding the financing for his films). In the way he through away any character who resemble him. Through away the jokes(which were becoming tiresome and repetitive) and give us a film which interesting and say something about the society we live in.It should be said that Allen has already made a film with a similar story-line(see Crimes and Misdemeanors) but where the former take the subject from a Jewish point of view(as a result of Allen presence in the film,). This film here take is from a less religious point of view. Allen says that nothing is important in life except if you have luck. The film is a simply a way to put his point forward and to convince us. From a moral point of view I would be satisfied if Chris Wilton(a very good Jonathan Rhys Meyers) would have been punished for his deeds, but as a movie who has a point to say I can live with the way Allen solve the whole things. The fact is that Chris leave with the burden of his deeds and no matter how he try to justified them, he still has this burden on his shoulders.The bottom line is that this is a very good film. Highly recommended thanks to a tight script, very good acting(more or less from everyone involved) and a directing which serve the script well.",8,0,0,20 February 2006
Snatch," Boring,not funny
","I'm going to say it right away,I didn't like the film at all.The film is nothing more than a bunch of cliches which try to be funny but ends up as shallow as possible. I like to laugh however I didn't laugh once in this pretentious film with its camera angles which hide a thin plot and a bad acting from every one involve.The film is nothing more than a bunch of actors who have all kind of what suppose to be 'funny' accents. If it meant to be a parody than its not a successful one. Beware of this film it's a waste of time not to mention a waste of money.",1,22,72,20 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A better effort
","*May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers*When Episode 1 saw the light of day it was greeted, by fans and non fans a like, with a huge disappointment and rightly so. The film was full with annoying characters and clichès that make the film almost unwatchable. The fact that it revolved around a small boy didn't make easier. The boy was so annoying you wish he would be gone for ever.It has to be said that this Episode is by far much better than its predecessor. The mix of action and characters development work good and George Lucas managed to set things in motion which will be played in Episode 3. However the film suffer from some problem which prevent the film from being excellent:1. The film is, at least, 20 minute longer. The film would have benefited from a shorter version.2. The romance between Senator Amidala(A good performance from Natalie Portman) and Anakin Skywalker(A solid performance from Hayden Christensen) does not work well. It is full of clichès and is heavily handled. It doesn't have a feeling of a true romance. 3. We all know the Anakin Skywalker is the future Darth Vader but I have trouble in believing that this young man will become the all mighty character from Episodes 4-6. Something is wrong in the way the character is built and portrayed.4. George Lucas insist of writing and directing. It has to be said that he is not good in both jobs. The fact that he doesn't have any distance from the material harm the film even more. He should think of giving these jobs to someone else. Past experience should have taught him that the best installment of 1st series was written and directed by other peoples than Lucas.5. Special effects- There are plenty of them here and as it happened so much lately the story serve them instead the other way around, which is a shame.Again it is a much better film the first one. Fans do not need any recommendation to see the film. The non fans can and will go. They will enjoy it no doubt.",8,0,1,10 July 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Cute.
",*May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers*The idea of the film is nothing short of brilliant. The monsters of our childhood do exist. Only they exist because they need to collect the screams of the children so Monsters' city will have enough electricity supply. And technically it is flawless. Pixar has come long way from its first computer animated film. It succeed each time to go a step further and this is no exception. However the technical achievement get lost in a story which is as thin as ice and also suffer from the fact that Disney had to put its usual inserted messages(this time: friends are forever and laugher is stronger than scream). Dream Works' Shrek has proven that an animated film can be wild and sarcastic. Monsters Inc. stays however on the safe side and as always with Disney very politically correct. And that is a shame because what could have been a wild film turn out to be only a cute one. Yes I enjoyed it and laughed from it but I wish it was less politically correct(The ending leave no question in your mind that we are heading for a sequel). Pixar should think of breaking away from Disney. It will only do them good and give them the opportunity to do what they really want.P.S. Do not miss what is shown before Monsters Inc. A short film named 'For the Birds'. Simply hilarious. It proves that with the right thing Pixar can do even better.,8,0,1,6 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great & fantastic
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*   *MAY CONTAIN SOPILERS*
The arguments against and for adaptation of book are always the same. It starts with the question what kind of adaptation is the best for the book? A loosely based on a the book or a faithful one. There are enough examples of success and failure for both approaches and the arguments about it would always be here. 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' will be used as a good example for those who are in favor of a middle ground between both approaches. It is not a 100% faithful adaptation but it is not a loosely based one. The film is a very good example that even a popular book, as this one, can be translated to the big screen without loosing any of its strength in the way and not forgetting that this a film a not a book.Peter Jackson(director and co-screen writer) has managed to keep me interested all through the film 3 hours run. He knew that there is no way he could put the whole book(and each part of the 3 books is a huge one)into the screen so he decided to be faithful to the main core of the story. He got rid of characters and plot lines that seems to him unnecessary and told the story with passion that gave the film an extra bonus. The result is a great film which looks fantastic(and you could see how good it look when the trailer came out). I admit to have a vague memory of the book. I have read it long time ago, but during the film I found my self remembering the book more and more. The film actually refreshed my memory. By the end of the book I knew that I have to and want to read the book one more. For me that alone is a sign for a good film. A one that make me curious about the original material.Jackson could not have done it without a cast that can bring the characters to life. In most case he had success in his choice of actors. Elijah Wood(Frodo Baggins) and Ian McKellen(Gandalf the Gray) are leading the excellent cast(I do have some reservation for Liv Tyler's presence, but her part is so short and at this point unnoticeable). The combination of known an unknown,English and Americans actors work well. New Zeeland looks terrific and serve as a very useful background. The decision to film there gave us a fresh and unknown landscape, one that looks like Middle Earth that we imagined. Howard Shore's score is nothing short of  brilliant. At time quite and at time operatic(always when needed) and  give the film the right atmosphere.I liked the film, very much. I was very sad when it ended because I knew I have to wait another year for part 2. The film is the best of 2001. And it deserve any recognition it get. Even people who have not read the book will enjoy it. It has everything a good film have: good script, excellent score and vision, very good acting and it have passion. All the above should convince you by now. Go and watch it.",9,0,0,19 January 2002
Cast Away," go see the film because of Tom Hanks
","'May contain a spoiler'The Robinson Crusoe's story is as old as I can remember and this movie is a sort of take-off on that old story, and it's quite a good take-off. Basically the film is divided to 3 parts,before the crash,the island and after the island. This structure help convey the transformation Hanks' character has gone through the film, however it is the film weakest point. The middle part is the best one in the film and the longest,the 2 other parts are simply not in the emotional scale of that part.I am not a huge fun of Tom Hanks. Sometimes he tend to be very annoying but sometime with the right script and director he gives a good performance(see 'Saving Private Ryan'). This is the case here.His performance is superb and his 3rd Oscar is almost certain to land in his hands.He carries the film on his shoulders and do best with what he has been given in the first place,which is not much.If you are a Tom Hanks fun you have already seen the film. If not go see it,Hanks deserve every praise he gets.",8,0,0,14 February 2001
Apocalypse Now," Impressive & powerful after all these years
","*May Contain Spoilers*  *May Contain Spoilers*This year see the re-release of one of all time classic, Apocalypse Now. The film Francis Ford Coppola directed in 1979 and has received the Palm D'Or in Cannes the same year. The film which is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novel:Heart of Darkness, has been digitally re-mastered, had an extra 50 minutes added to it and at length of 195 minutes is worth every minute and every effort to see it. With some striking images and a story which takes it time to fold the movie remains as powerful as it was 22 years ago.Some of the movie's power lies in the fact that Coppola wasn't afraid to show what he think about the war in Vietnam. You can guess that he was not in favor of it and he also show the effect it had on the simple  soldiers that have to fight in an impossible situation. The story follows Cap. Willard (Martin Sheen) in his mission to find a execute one Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who according to the army's chiefs has gone astray, building his own army and not following orders any more. While the story centered on this premise, one should take note to the character of Lance B. Johnson (Sam Bottoms) because he seems to represent America. Lance is America, America is Lance. His image of the clean all American boy in the beginning of the film, is the image of America when it got involved in the war. His image at the end of the film is how America ended this war, spirit broken, confused and wounded.As for the extra 50 minutes there are 2 important extra sequences each one serve for another purpose. Of the 2, the one which involve Willard's encounter with the French is one of importance because it gives the historical context to the war which was missing from the original version. It also show that The American seems to make the same mistakes(USA has created the Vietcong and now fighting it) all over again.Since it first release, I have watched this film more than once and every time I have found a new angle to look at it a new thing I haven't notice before. And yet though I think that it is film everyone should see, and more than once will be better, I do not think that this is a film with no flaws. The whole last part, which takes place in Col. Kurtz' camp remains a little un-clear. At the end of the movie I didn't feel that I know about Kurtz more than I knew about him in the beginning of the film, nor did I have more knowledge to his motives and action. The ending is open to interpretation and my guess about it is as good anyone else guess.Nevertheless, this is a must see movie. Relevant today as it was 22 years ago. The combination of all the elements (excellent photography by Vittorio Storaro) makes a film which is still disturbing and powerful after all these years.",9,0,0,23 November 2001
Spider-Man," Plenty to enjoy from
","*May contain spoiler* *May contain spoilers*There are a lot of examples from the past for a successful adaptation of comic books(Batman 1 & 2, Superman 1 and The X-Man). There are also examples for very bad adaptations(Batman 3 & 4 and Superman 2,3 &4). I am quite happy to say that Spider-Man belong to the better side of adaptation. The script is good and give basis to the characters and for future installment. The idea to make an analogy between Parker's growing power and him becoming an adult work well and is handled intelligently. The pace is good and fast and there is some humor that works well. Tobey MaGuire's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is spot on. He has that something that make us believing what is going om with him. Kirsten Dunst is good though her character is less complex and remain a little bit flat. Willem Dafoe, to my taste, is lacking the menace that his character demands. But that is my taste and in general he does a good job.I did have 2 problems with the film:1. The effects of Spider-Man  flying through the streets has been done completely by computer and it shows. The computer has problem of imitating a natural human movement and you see it in any move that Spider-Man does.2. The script,though good, has holes in it. An example for that can be seen in M.J. declaration of love to Peter Parker towards the end of the film. It comes from nowhere. Suddenly, out of nowhere, she declares her love to him. There are several examples for that and that is a shame.It is good, entertaining and relatively short(only 2 hours run)which is a blessing. Go see it. It worth every Euro/Dollar you will spend on it.",8,0,0,10 July 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Entertaining
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Take one successful director(Steven Soderbergh) and several big names(George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and etc.). Take a film from the 60's and make a remake with the above list and what you got is this film.  It can sometime go wrong and the result will be a disaster, but Ocean's Eleven is an example that it can sometime have a good ending. Because this is a film that have so much style and is very polished you can forget that the premise is as old as movie making. The premise of the perfect robbery. And yet under that old premise, lies a subtext which is as enjoyable as the main one. The subtext deal with making a movie and the relation between fiction and reality. While these are not the main subjects of the film there are there, in the air, in what people says and the whole execution of the robbery.The cast(old and new) is good and they are on spot with the characters. They seems to enjoyed their parts very much(Julia Roberts' presence was not essential and her role could have been done by someone else). Soderbergh is in full control and delivered a work which seems effortless. Like making a film(and a robbery) could not be easier than this. I enjoyed this film very much and everyone who like to be enjoyed and entertained should go and see the film.",8,0,0,29 January 2002
Cars," Moving,funny
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Pixar tend to set the standards for the animation films. Every film is exceeding your expectations and show you what can be gained with what can be described as perfectionism. The Incerdibles was a mile stone in animation. I was asking myself where and how further they can go. As usual, with Pixar, they show that they can go further with technology. The sets look as real as possible. You get the feel you are on Route 66 and its unique landscape. I had a problem getting use to the talking cars. This subject is a deviation from a traditional Pixar movie. While other Pixar movies have been focused on a world which run in parallel to our world, a world we don't even know it exist, this movie create a world which is an allegory to our world. Pixar wanted to say something about our society and invent a world which doesn't exist for that reason(pay attentions: there are no humans in this world. Each car represent a type of person that exist in reality). When you get used to this idea, you can fairly enjoy the film. Which is funny, moving, say something about us and make it no secret that he prefer the way we lived in the past than the way we live now.The end of the film, when the credit run, is a pleasure. It shows that Pixar can laugh on itself and its success. And wait till all the credits end, than there is another surprise.In one word: recommended.",8,0,0,22 July 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wonderful!!!
","This is a kind of movie I wish I could see every time I go to a movie. A movie that you love and you don't have to find reasons why. You devote yourself completely to the movie and when it ends you simply want more of it.The basis for the film is a love story(actually 2 love stories),which run simultaneously in the film,but the way the story is been told, is simply superb. Ang Lee takes his time and tells the story slowly. He pulls us in to the story and make us care for every thing that happens in the film. In his way from A to B he is not afraid to show long scenes that serve the movie well, or some fight scenes which defies the laws of gravity and yet remain true to the nature of the film.The film is beautifully shot and well acted,and it's a shame that none of the actors involved has got any Oscar nomination.Let's hope the Academy will give this film the recognition it deserve.The film is a rare thing.It leaves you breathless and the word wonderful (repeated more than once) is a word that describe it well and yet not enough to explain why. To understand, you must see this film.",10,0,0,21 February 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Disappointing,because it had a huge potential
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Musicals. This kind of films have disappeared almost completely in the last 30 years of so.They were very popular in the 50's & 60's but from the 70's onward it is hard to find a good adaptation of a stage musical on the silver screen. The place is too short to explain why, but it has to do with the fact that musicals are a very unrealistic medium which didn't go well with the realistic themes that ruled the movie industry from the 70's.
I like musicals, some of my all time favorite films are musicals. So one can only imagine how delighted I was when I heard that Baz Luhrman was making a musical. For me he is the one director that can revive the musicals and bring it to a modern audience. However I have a mix feeling about the end result and it has to do with some of the decisions Luhrman took when he made the film. Some of his decisions are both to the advantage and to the disadvantage of the film.It should be said at this point that this is not a regular musical but a one that correspond with others musical and other forms of music. So the decision to build Paris and film everything on a set in Australia and not in actual Paris is a direct continuance to what use to be done in the old days. Some of the great musicals of the past were completely filmed in one of Hollywood's studio were all the set was build(beside in real Paris the end scene, the one with the gun, could never have happened). Also the prime decision to set the story among people and places who actually existed(i.e:Toulouse Lautrec, The Moulin Rouge and Monmartre)  was a good one, however this decision also back fire because Lautrec and his Bohemians were prominent in Paris of the 1899 but from the movie you can not understand how important their ideas were and anyone who doesn't know what they were talking about would have the impression that they were simply a caricature, which is how they are been portrayed in this film.Luhrman use modern songs instead of a completely new material. That for itself isn't bad. That may bring young audience, however again a one which turn against the film. Instead of using one song for each scene,Luhrman decided to build a layer of songs for most of the scenes. That way the film becomes a quiz: 'Which song is this? and which one is that?'. By using only a sentence from each song Luhrman manage to alienate the young audience who come expecting for his beloved tunes only to find out that he was cheated.(In the screening I was present,the young audience was slowly leaving because he lost interest).In several scenes there is only one song, and those scenes are the one that show what could have happened if that was the case all through the film(I am referring to the scenes where you can hear: Roxane,The Show Must Go On and to some extent also the ones where Like A Virgin,Your Song  and the Can Can are performed. They are the best scenes in the film and I can only wish that the whole film was like those scenes).Every scene is so packed with colors and movement that in a certain moment my eyes got so tired and I couldn't, any longer, pay attention to what happened on the screen.Shame , because there is so much going on and is composed in a way that meant to attract the eyes but the effect is quite the opposite.The acting is good in general, though as I said before the characters are merely caricatures and the actors are doing well with what they have, which is not much. Nicole Kidman is excellent as Satine and she sing well but not on the high notes. Ewan McGregor have a nice voice  but a little one dimensional and flat. Unfortunately Kidman put him under her shadow which result with a week character in compare to her Satine.Whether you go to this film or not it is your decision. You may like it or not. Just be prepared for what comes. I still hope that Luhrman will make another musical and that it would be better than this one.",6,0,1,22 October 2001
Mulholland Drive," Who is Rita? Who cares...
","*May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers*David Lynch has always had an eye for the strange and the bizarre. Most of his films are full with eccentric characters and have enough clues to fill some extra films. So the real question is whether or not you can relate to his characters. If the answer is yes(like in : The Straight Story or The Elephant Man), than you will like the film. If not(like in: Blue Velvet or Wild at Heart) than you are in troubles.This film, which is hard to describe exactly about what it is without revealing too much of the plot, begins with a car accident which leads to a loss of memory by a woman, which later we will know as Rita(Laura Harring). She is helped by an aspired actress called Betty(Namoi Watts). From now on it's free ride in the world of David Lynch. As usual it is full of characters that come and disappear never to be seen again. As always it is full with clues that suppose to help you solve the mystery. That is if you pay attention closely. However nothing can help you if the 2 main characters are simply boring and not interesting enough for you to care. And that for me was the low point of the film. I couldn't stand the main characters. I couldn't care less who is Rita or what is she hiding from and I couldn't stand the irritating Betty. So for me the film was lost at the moment I realized that I don't like the main characters. From here it was easy to see that the film(originally a pilot for a series, which was rejected by ABC and was extended to film)is nothing but re-telling of old things which Lynch himself has done better before(see Twin Peaks) and therefore boring.It is interesting to see that a film as boring as this one, has produced so many interpretations, that in itself suppose to help people understand the film better. Some of these interpretations are better and more interesting than the film itself. So here is another one: The first part of the film is a dream. In a dream you take things from reality and place them in another order. In some cases you make your life in the dream a better place than your real life. In the 2nd part of the film we get to know the 'real' story. And the relation between reality and dream can provide for another film. But Lynch is not interested in that. He just want to play with his characters and with the audience. He seems to have succeeded. Most of the audience like the film very much. I didn't. As far as I am concerned it was a waste of time and money. There were 2 points that stood above the film: The beautiful music(as always) from Angelo Badalamenti and the cinematography. But that's not enough to hold a film for 145 minute.In short avoid. Unless you are a fan of David Lynch. If you are, you will find here plenty of what you like.",3,0,3,25 March 2002
The Mummy Returns," Entertaining enough to ignore other aspects of the film
","Sequels,you can't do anything about it. You know it will come back when a movie gross over 100 hundred million dollars(more close to 200m). The question remains would it be a good sequel or a bad one? The answer depends of what you expect from a film or,for that matter, a sequel. If you expect that the sequel will give you some characters development,will be more sophisticated and will have some reasonable not to mention a convincing plot, than look somewhere else , because you will not find these things in this film. It basically do 'The Mummy' all over with not much changes to it. The characters remain the same, though the addition of Evie's past was a nice touch,though very much convenient. The plot the remains the same, and everything goes as predictable as a sequel can be. Not a shred of surprise or originality here. You can see what comes miles ahead.The effects were good though in some cases they looked like computer generated ones (which means they look phony and not convincing enough, which shouldn't happen in a film that relies heavily on effects).Nevertheless the film is fun to watch and entertaining enough to ignore all other aspects. The film enjoy a fast phase which is its great asset and help passed it 2 hours running quite quickly. It is not a must film. It will take 2 hours from your day leaving you with the feeling the you have received value for your money. What kind of value is another question.",7,0,0,21 May 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," An OK film, nothing more.
","*SPOILERS*  *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*The makers of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone encountered 3 obstacles when adapting the book to the big screen.1. A very popular book. An adaptation should satisfied the many people who read the book.2. A very control writer. J.K. Rowling knew exactly how she wanted the film to look like and was not going to let anyone destroy her work.3. The book is a set-up. The basic setting and main characters are described in details and will not be described any more. Other were briefly mentioned and will be dealt later.With these 3 obstacles in mind, can anyone be surprise that everyone involved in the project have chosen an faithful adaptation for the book. And while this approach has solved the first 2 obstacles . It only solved half of the 3rd one. Things that were dealt in the book were ignored in the film and would have to be dealt in later films. With a limit time of running for a film I can not see how they are going to do this.(but this is more a problem for the makers and not for me). But even the most faithful adaptation is bound to have changes. Changes are inevitable and here there are no exception. There are changes and I found three of these changes to suggest that the book has not been carefully read or that Rowling's control was not always at best.1. The scene in the zoo - At this stage in his life Harry Potter is not aware that he is a wizard. The way the scene is written and directed seem to suggest the opposite. It makes Harry's reaction late a little illogic.2. The riddles on the way to the stone - There are many riddles, each represent a teacher. Some of them disappeared on the way to the big screen. But there are three which are important. The 1st involve the flying keys. This one represent Harry's strength in being a Seeker in Quidditch. The 2nd involve a live chess game. This one represent Ron Weasley's strength in that game. He is the best player. The 3rd involve potions. This one represent Hermione Granger's strength in logic and show how sharp her mind is. The whole way to the stone also show that our 3 hero's have to work together in order to solve everything. Alone they can not make it. For some reason Hermione's riddle has disappeared from the film and to add insult to injury Professor Dumbledore mention her riddle at the end of the year feast. Confusing to say the least. If you have read the book, you will know what he is talking about. If not you can only guest.3. Harry's confrontation with Voldemort - Harry's reaction to Professor Quirrell come from instincts. The film turns him into a murderer and with no consequences. Not the message I'd like children to see.I was missing 2 other aspects of the book. Harry's life at The Dursleys doesn't look as bad as it was described in the book and I didn't get the sense of a school which in the book is very much part of the book.Chris Columbus is an adequate director. He doesn't have the ability or the vision to give the material an extra bonus. He directed the film according to the book , no extras. In his decision to be faithful to the book he ignored the fact that the book  and the film are 2 different mediums and that there is a place for changes that will reflect that fact. John Williams' music is good and serve the film well. The cast, with no exception is good, but some of them could be use more. I am very glad that all actors were English and that it was filmed in England. It kept the spirit of the book intact. There were 2 scenes that were better than the rest of the film The Quidditch game(too short and not enough) and the live  chess gane towards the end of the film. If only the rest of the film was like that we might have a better film.This is not a bad film nor is it an excellent one. It rank as an OK film. I do think that people who have never read the book will enjoy from it more than people who have read the book. And after the film they will run to read the book, which is good. It is shame though. The book had the potential for a good movie but the result is less than expected.",7,0,1,15 January 2002
Ice Age," Nice ,nothing more
","*May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers*In the age of Shrek(the movie) & Pixar(the studio), this is a much more traditional animation film. It put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together(not to mentioned, try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father). They begin as enemies and end as best friend. If this sound like a Disney film, it is(only made through 20th Century Fox). The trailer to the movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set. The problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but  the film is mostly aimed at children. The parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min. their children's attention is focused on something else than them. The backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film. Children will love this film, adults will only like it.",7,0,0,25 June 2002
Shrek," Hilarious
","Animation is getting advanced every time a new animated film is been produced. With Shrek you can see it and appreciate it to the full. There was always a problem that the human characters were not so believable. This film prove that with computer animation they are about to solve this aspect of animated films.Not just the animation but everything in this film is superb. A story that in the world of animation, make sense, move fast,combined with well build characters, which are supported by superb voices who make every character unique(especially Eddie Murphy who is better here than he is in his own films). To the mix you should add some black and politically incorrect humor, some jocks which are aimed at Dream Works' main rival,Disney, and some scenes which show that today films are more close to an animation films than anyone has ever thought it would. The result is Shrek. I found my self laughing constantly. It was simply hilarious. The jocks work in all levels. Some of them are simple others are sophisticated enough. Children and adults will enjoy this film  for different reasons.All in all I highly recommend this film. I had only one objection. I didn't like the forced message which was inserted in the film. In a such politically incorrect film the message looked forced. That's the reason why I gave the film a 9 out of 10. I could live without the message. Otherwise it is a perfect movie.",9,0,0,23 July 2001

The more the film progress the more predictable it became and I , for once, couldn't stand it. Mel Gibson looks lost in the part and the expression on his face seems to say: what the hell am I doing in this film(well at least I got good money for it). The other actors say their texts but do not seem to make any sense of it.In short, avoid. Spent your money on something better.",1,2,3,9 September 2002
Amélie," Weird but nice
","The world of Amelie Poulain(very good Audrey Tanton, who captured the essence of her character) is weird. She see herself as someone who help people. Sometime she helps someone to find love, fulfill a dream or just help to solve a mystery which involve photo's and if needed she take revenge on someone who is too cruel to someone els. And all the time she is also looking for love for herself. If it sounds weird to you wait until you see the film because the film is presented through the eyes of Amelie and if you liked her you would like the film. If, however you did not like her, you would find the film very irritating. And that is the strong point of the film and also its weakest point. Director Jeunet liked Amelie very much. He sympathize with her and embrace her point of view fully. That is not a bad thing because in doing so he make us identify with her and with her action. I liked the film but there are viewers who will find the film too annoying precisely because there is no distance between them and the main character. There is no judgment at all on what she does, there is no moral judgment of right or wrong. Her actions are accepted with no questions. There is another point that for me was a big plus. I like the way Jeunet present Paris in the film. Paris is very much a part of the film. It seems that the film could not have taken place in another city. At the end of the film I wanted to go straight to Paris.Yes it is a weird film and yet I have found myself enjoying it. It is nicely done, Paris looks great and you do go out from the film with a smile on your face. What more can we ask from a film?",8,0,1,29 January 2002
Munich," Good but not flawless
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILER* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*This a good film but it has flaws. It has a fast rhythm(which makes its 164 minutes pass quite quickly) and yet if it would have been about 20 minutes shorter, it would have been even more effective. Some of characters are introduced and never showed up later(take for example the character of Mike Harari). The acting is good but not even. Some actors are shining above the others while some actors are merely there because the script required their presence.Some people complain that the film is far from the true. The film has never intended to be a representation of the true but rather an interpretation for the events and as such it use the subject to say something that is as relevant today as it was relevant for the time it is dealing with. The obvious of what the film want to say is that violence leads to more violence. The less obvious is that in some point the hunter becomes the hunted, that there is always someone who will profit(making money) from all the violence, that there is a moral & personal price to pay when you kill people(even if you think that in the beginning it is for a just cause).Go and see the film.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Funny but pointless
","I'll say right away.I like the Coen brothers. I find them to be truly originals. They try to show that there are more to films than cliches and in every film they show that what concern the technicality they are superb and this is no difference. Technically speaking they are superb. However it seems that in this film they some how neglected the story. The basis for the story is Homer's Odyssey but you won't miss anything if you have never read it because it's the characters from the Odyssey that the film is full with and nothing more.Further more the films is full with characters who come in to the film and disappear after a few minutes only to re-appear in a later stage,with no explanations to their motives or a better insight to their characters,which were one dimension. I also had  a feeling that the whole story was formed as a meaning to serve for the music numbers and that made the film a little bit pointless though I like music and musicals I found it here to be ill serving the movie.But in a strange way I rather enjoyed the film, and I wasn't bored from it and in order to enjoy this film you have to be a real fan of the Coen brothers.",8,0,1,15 January 2001
