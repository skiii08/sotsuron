The Monuments Men," A unique story, but a disappointing film.
","George Clooney's 'The Monuments Men' is the story of a unique platoon in World War II that was assigned to save stolen artwork that the Nazis had stolen. It has a strong cast with Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, and Bob Balaban. Clooney even wrote the script with Grant Heslov. There was a lot going for this film, but I walked out disappointed.It's a very rushed movie. You zoom through facts and what these men were doing. It captures the important moments, but doesn't string them together well. We lose character development in exchange for facts that we could easily read. I felt like Clooney went more for the jokes at times. The cast has good chemistry, but I feel like there was missing bits of information and character development. The actors are all good in it. The performance that stood out to me was Bill Murray. He always does a good job of blending humor with deep emotions. I enjoyed Clooney's style for the film. It feels like a 1940s patriotic war film in color. Alexandre Desplat's score complements this style. It works for the story, but it doesn't strike much depth about patriotism. It's a film made for the love of classic artwork and the importance of preserving the art that has defined humans. You feel that importance at times, but it becomes muddled in a rushed story that aims for jokes more often than needed.Clooney means well with 'The Monuments Men,' but it's a flawed film that probably needed more time in order for it to be completely told. It's not necessarily a bad film, but it is disappointing.",6,0,0,23 July 2014
Begin Again," For the music lovers.
","3 1/2 out of 4 stars.John Carney is back with a new musical. His 2006 film 'Once' is one of my favorite films of all time and I was interested to see where Carney would go next. Watching the trailers for 'Begin Again' didn't give me much hope for it, but just enough for me to go out and see it. I enjoyed it much more than I expected though.'Begin Again' is very similar to 'Once,' except Carney has a bigger budget and famous movie stars. It deals with Dan and Greta (Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, respectively) who after being cheated on by their former boyfriend/girlfriend meet up and record some songs together. Ruffalo is great as the down on his luck, charming, but often drunk, music producer Dan. Knightley also has a solid performance. Adam Levine does a good job of being a jerk and James Corden is hilarious as Greta's busking friend Steve. The films has themes of love, fatherhood, and the way we use music in our lives.'Begin Again' is for all the music lovers out there who enjoy creating music. The movie is filled with characters whose religion is music. Look at Dan's car and how he has a music cable hung up on the mirror next to a cross. There's a great moment when Dan listens to Greta perform for the first time. What is just a voice and guitar slowly grows into something much bigger and beautiful. The soundtrack is more poppy compared to the folk songs in 'Once,' but they are nice to listen to.This film is the movie you kind of have to be in the mood for to really enjoy. It can be predictable and sappy at times, but it does it well. If you accept it for what it is, you'll enjoy it. 'Begin Again' is a musical treat this summer that will leave you wanting to listen to more music and maybe even creating some of your own.",8,64,87,3 July 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America gets the film he deserves.
","4 out of 4 stars.Anthony and Joe Russo give Captain America the film he deserves with their 2014 film 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.' This is a comic book blockbuster that has heart, wit, and a political message. It's a smart film that doesn't get caught up in visual effects and explosions. It has something to say while entertaining us with the things we expect from a Marvel film.'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' finds Steve Rogers/Captain America (played by Chris Evans) in modern Washington, D.C. and navigating through the politics of his new world. The good guys and bad guys are not as clear anymore and he has to face a new threat in the mysterious Winter Soldier. This film has impressive action scenes, solid performances, and a well written script that balances humor, character, and story. It's a political thriller that makes us look at big brother government, drone technology, and the line between freedom and fear. You could watch this film at the surface level and enjoy it or you can look at these political messages and enjoy it just as much. That's what I like about this film. It doesn't want to dumb down the audience. It wants to make them think and have fun at the same time. Personally, I think 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is the best of the phase 2 Avengers films. It might be too soon to say that with 'Guardians of the Galaxy' coming out in August, but I was disappointed by 'Iron Man 3' and 'Thor: The Dark World.' 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' builds on 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'The Avengers' very well. You don't have to see these films to enjoy it, but it gives more context for the characters and where they have been. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a really good film that gives everyone a fun time and something to think about it.",10,0,1,2 July 2014
The Lego Movie," A great movie for those who grew up with Legos.
","4 out of 4 stars.When I first saw the previews for this movie, I was skeptical. My brother and I loved Legos growing up, but a stop-motion animated feature with Legos both intrigued me and made me worry. However, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's 'The Lego Movie' is a smart, quick, witty, and self-reflexive animated film that lives up to all the fun anyone can have with Legos. The story is about about Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego builder, who finds the 'Special' and is chased by Lord Business (Will Ferrel) throughout the Lego realms. Emmet gets help from the master builders, which include Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), and many more. What's great about 'The Lego Movie' is that it knows what it is, accepts it, but has a lot of fun with it. Whether its Popsicle wielding Legos or the dreaded glue, 'The Lego Movie' sets up a quirky universe that is smart and creative. It brings together superheroes, science-fiction characters, wizards, astronauts, presidents, and basketball players and let's them all have a fun say in the story.It looks at the way we use Legos. There are the instruction crazed Lego builders and the builders who make up whatever they want. Personally, I was the rule following builder and my brother was the master builder. 'The Lego Movie' captures the best of both and makes you remember the magic of building Legos. The film is an ode to creativity and building dreams.You can also look at this film in philosophical ways. It's about identity and modern society. It may seem ridiculous to look at an animated film like that, but you can with this film. It balances these ideas with great fun and imagination.'The Lego Movie' is a colorful, original, and hilarious film that opens your imagination. It's well- written, has a great cast, and beautiful animation. Kids can laugh at the slap-stick humor and adults can catch all the witty dialogue and film references. I think it's one of the best animated films of this year and one of my favorite films so far this year.",10,0,2,6 July 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," One of the best X-Men movies
","If you include the Wolverine films, there have been 6 X-Men movies. Bryan Singer's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is the seventh film of this franchise and it is one of the best. It has everything you want in an X-Men movie, from cool new mutants and actions scenes to the blending of both the original X-Men cast and the 'X-Men: First Class' cast. It may be a little crowded with all these character, but Singer does a good job of balancing them. 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' focuses on Wolverine who is sent back to the 1970s after humans and mutants have almost become extinct by Sentinels. In the 1970s, Wolverine has to reunite a young Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) in order to stop the Sentinels from being created. With a strong cast and action packed and witty script, Singer gives us a blockbuster ride that is just as fun as it is emotionally engaging. I grew up with the X-Men series so it was weird, but awesome, seeing all these characters I grew up with again and combining the great 'X- Men: First Class' cast with them. There's a hilarious new mutant called Quicksilver (Evan Peters). He has a really good scene where he is running in a room to the song 'Time In A Bottle' by Jim Croce.'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is a great addition to the X-Men series. I know people will debate the time travel aspects of the story and how it stands with the comics. As a film-goer, though, I had a lot of fun watching this film and think it is one of the better sequels and comic book movies out right now. I don't think you'd be wasting your money seeing this film.",8,1,3,23 July 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," 'The world is not a wish-granting factory.'
","3 1/2 out of 4 stars.John Green's novel 'The Fault In Our Stars' has been a big hit for the past couple years. It tells the story of two teenagers with cancer who fall in love. It was only a matter of time until it was turned into a movie and fans of the book will not be disappointed by the film.Josh Boone's 2014 adaption of 'The Fault In Our Stars' stays true to the novel thanks to its writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (who also wrote '500 Days of Summer' and 'The Spectacular Now'). There were one or two changes from the book and some things had to be eliminated. If the film had an extra half-hour or hour, it would be exactly like the book. I have read the book and the things they had to take out make sense. Boone's adaptation works very well thanks to its strong cast. Shailiene Woodley is great as Hazel and she has great chemistry with Ansel Elgort (who plays Augustus). Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, and Willem Dafoe are also well cast. Although it can be sappy at times, the cast makes the line works and we can care about these characters.The film does have its faults, though. The editing is awkward at times and I thought the exposition seemed just a little rushed. The music is good for the most part, but there are awkward moments where the music doesn't work ('Boom Clap' by Charli XCX being the strangest). However, there are moments where the music fits perfectly, like Ray LaMontagne's 'Without Words' and M83's 'Wait.''The Fault In Our Stars' is effectively brought to the big screen. Fans of the book and people who haven't read it should enjoy it. It may not be a movie for everybody, but it's a solid adaptation.",7,0,1,2 July 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," 'This is Berk. Life here is amazing.'
","4 out of 4 stars.Animated sequels can be a dangerous thing. I've seen plenty of animated sequels that just do what the first did, but bigger and louder. It's a shame when this happens, especially when the first one was good. However, Dean DuBlois' 'How To Train Your Dragon 2' actually expands on the universe it built and does it beautifully. The story follows Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and the dragon Toothless as they continue to explore the lands surrounding Berk and the dragons that live around them. Most of the cast from the first one has returned with Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou, and Kit Harrington joining in. All of them do a great job and bring life to these characters.This film is visually stunning. It's one of the most beautiful three dimensional animated films I've seen. John Powell's sweeping score complements the scenery and the grand scope of the film. There is more action in this film, but it doesn't overwhelm the story or characters. Everything feels balanced and progresses naturally. It doesn't just redo what it did in the first one. DeBlois explores new territories and gives these characters a story they deserve.'How To Train Your Dragon 2' is great fun for all ages and does what a sequel should do. It's a beautiful looking film that is well written and has a great cast. It's one of the best animated films of the year and is just a really good film.",10,4,9,6 July 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Anderson At His Best
","Wes Anderson's 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a great film and one of my favorite Anderson films. He has come a long way from 'Bottle Rocket' and has perfected his style. The story is about hotel concierge Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) and lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) as they navigate their way through a murder mystery and a growing war in Europe in the 1930s. It's an epic tale that is fast paced, witty, and bitter sweet. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is simply a great story where everything is just what it needs to be. Ralph Fiennes is hilarious as Gustave H. Many of the actors in this film have been in other Anderson films, but Fiennes fits right in and dishes out laughs. Anderson has fun playing around with frames. Whatever time period the film moves to, the framing complements the time period it is in. When we are in the 1930s, the framing is thin and tall like the films of the that time. As time progress, the framing gets wider. It's clever and and meaningful, just like the rest of the film.The film looks great thanks to all the focus on the small details of the sets. Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is always balanced and complements the wit of the story. Alexandre Desplat's playful music adds laughs and captures Anderson's blend of humor and drama very well. It is a very colorful film (both figurative and literally) and has the dollhouse composition Anderson fans have come to know. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' has everything you want from an Anderson film. Whether it is Billy Murray and Jason Scwartzman or characters with passions or long tracking shots or childish adults and children beyond their or funny original artwork, it's all there. Anderson has perfected his craft and this film shows it. This is one of my favorite films of the year and I hope it isn't forgotten about when awards season comes. It's a funny and meaningful story with characters that you get attached to. Anderson takes you to other worlds and engages you with tales and characters that aren't afraid to be original. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a movie that I think everyone can enjoy and I'm glad it is getting recognized.",10,5,9,23 July 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A sequel that doesn't live up to the first one.
","2 1/2 out of 4 stars.Marc Webb's 2014 film 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is your average Blockbuster film that doesn't build very well on its first film. I was excited for this film after watching Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man.' I thought Andrew Garfield did a really good job playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man and bringing much more emotion to the role. However, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' just makes things bigger and hopes that it will be better.I will admit, the visual effects are cool and seeing shots from Spider-Man's perspective are impressive, but it doesn't hold up for a film that's almost 2 1/2 hours. The storyline for the film is also weak. We're told things before we really need to know them (like in the opening scene) and there are too many villains (just like Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 3). There is Paul Giamatti's Rhino (who doesn't get much screen time), Jamie Foxx's Electro (who gets the cheesiest lines), and Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (who could've been a much more effective villain if he was given more screen time). All these villains become more one-dimensional. If they just picked one, I think the film would've been better and the villain could feel much more real. Luckily, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (playing Gwen Stacy) have great chemistry and bring life to a film filled with too many visual effects. Sally Field is also effective as Aunt May. The film has interesting themes of life, death, pain, and what it means to be a hero, but none of them feel complete by the end. Peter Parker deals with these heavy themes, but it's not reflected in his Spider-Man identity. If I didn't like the first film as much as I did, I probably would've given this movie a lower rating. There are more Spider-Man films to come and I hope that the filmmakers can learn from the mistakes in this film to give Spider-Man a film he deserves.",5,0,3,2 July 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," A surprising treat that I'm happy to say works.
","I remember watching the trailers for James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and scratching my head in confusion. A science fiction comedy set in the comic book world of Marvel's Avengers? It didn't add up to me along with the 1960s-70s soundtrack. However, all of these different things add up to make one of the best summer blockbusters of the year.With a script co-written by Nicole Perlman, Gunn introduces us to a new part of the Marvel's Avengers universe with Chris Pratt leading the group as Peter Quill, who likes to call himself Star Lord. Pratt is great as Quill. He's able to do everything in this role, from the action scenes to dramatic moments to dancing on a strange planet. Pratt is joined with a green Zoe Saldana as the assassin Gamora, the very literal and muscular Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), the ferocious and hilarious raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the simple tree creature Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Although they are visual effects, Cooper and Diesel are great as the scene stealing duo. They always come in at the right moment and have the right thing thing to say or do. All these characters have some loss that defines them. Gunn does a great job of combining that pain with laughter and making these characters feel real. Perlman and Gunn's script is quirky and action packed. They follow a comic book movie formula, but always add a little twist to complement the strange and fun characters we follow. It's nice to see a big budget movie like this play around with itself. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' feels like Edgar Wright's 'Shaun of the Dead.' It's great for its genre, but also adds great, witty humor to it.Tyler Bates does a good job with the score, but its the 60s and 70s songs that you'll remember. The songs work so well and help give the film its edge. It seems odd at first, but they fit right in. Ben Davis' cinematography is epic and colorful. He gets to work with many colors with the backdrop of space behind him. The visual effects are also top notch. It's a very good looking film.You don't necessarily have to watch the other Marvel's Avengers film in order to understand this one. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a very new part to this universe. The films that would help a little are both the Thor films and Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers.' There are little things that hint at these films.Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a fun film that delivers both laughs and blockbuster action. It can be wacky and strange at times, but it's a really good film that keeps you engaged. Everything that I thought would go wrong for this film actually worked. It's a nice surprise for the end of this summer that is worth treating yourself to.",10,3,6,9 August 2014
Jersey Boys," 'Everybody remembers it how they need to.'
","3 out of 4 stars.I was really excited for this movie. I saw the play in Chicago about 5 years ago and loved it. Clint Eastwood is one of my favorite directors and I thought 'Jersey Boys' would be one of my favorite films of this year, but I was disappointed by Eastwood's adaptation of the hit Broadway play. Maybe I set my expectations too high. It's hard not to compare it to the play.The acting is top notch (particularly John Lloyd Young, who won a Tony for the play), the sets are authentic, and the music is great. However, I felt Eastwood decided to add more talking moments and put the music to the side. The music becomes more background noise and not the driving force of the film. The film becomes more of a standard music biopic than the musical on Broadway. I understand why they made some of the choices and some of them work very well, but I would have liked to have seen more musical moments.A lot of time is placed on the exposition and I thought it kind of slowed the film down. The actors break the fourth wall throughout the film, but I don't think Eastwood's style worked as well with it. Films that break the fourth wall and talk directly to the camera (like Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' or Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas) have a particular energy that drives the film. Eastwood, though, has a slower and more patient style and I'm not sure if breaking the fourth wall always went well with the film. The actors are good enough to make it work though.The movie is at its best when the music comes to the forefront. Eastwood does a good job of showing the fun the band has creating music and the audiences' reaction to the music. It shows the power of their music. One of my favorite moments is when the band plays 'Cry for Me' for the first time. It's music being created so naturally and shows why Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons are great. Other great song moments include 'My Eyes Adored You' and the tear jerking rendition of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You.'Eastwood's 'Jersey Boys' has its faults, but the sheer power of the music and the acting makes it a treat worth seeing.",7,27,34,22 June 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," A nice surprise.
","3 out of 4 stars.I didn't think this film would work. I had seen the previews many times and had no urge to see it. Tom Cruise has had several disappointing action films, like his 2013 film 'Oblivion.' However, critics started giving 'Edge of Tomorrow' good reviews and I gave it a chance. I'm surprised to say that I liked it.Doug Liman's 2014 film 'Edge of Tomorrow' is an action-packed summer blockbuster that is actually smart and funny. The film is about an American officer (played by Tom Cruise) who is forced to fight in a an alien battle in France, but he hijacks the alien's power so that every time he dies, he wakes up the day before the battle with the memory of how he died. He can build on these memories and figure out what to do.Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, and Bill Paxton give solid performances and the story has its twist and turns that keep you engaged. The dialogue is very blockbustery. You've heard some of these lines before, some of them probably by Tom Cruise in other movies. I thought the movie was consistent for the most part, but the ending is a little corny. If I didn't walk into the film so skeptical, I may have liked it a little more. 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a nice surprise that is actually worth seeing. It's a fun, action-filled ride that will keep you engaged.",7,1,3,2 July 2014
Godzilla," Godzilla looks great, but the films has its faults.
","I don't know a lot about the Godzilla films. I've only watched the disappointing Roland Emmerich 1998 film and only small bits of the old ones. I watched the trailer for Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' and became very interested in this adaptation. From the trailer, it looked visually stunning and intense. I have to say, though, I was a let down by this film.The story is mostly about Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his encounters with Godzilla. They conveniently meet from Japan to Hawaii to California as Godzilla tries to find and destroy two new monsters who were released (the trailer made no mention of these two creatures). There is another storyline with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who gives us background information about the new Godzilla.Godzilla looks great in this film. He is huge and looks very realistic. Every time he comes on the screen it's really good. However, Edwards makes this film like Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws' so we don't get to see Godzilla as much. The film decides to follow the humans more and tries to be a character drama. I don't think this worked out though. I felt like the characters were thinly scripted. We've seen these kind of characters before. The performances aren't bad, but I never felt emotionally engaged with any of them. The cast is great with Oscar winner Juliette Binoche and Oscar nominees Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. It even has Bryan Cranston who seems to have won everything except an Oscar, but I just didn't feel connected to them. I didn't really care for them.The story is forced and has a few plot holes. Many people just happen to be in the right place at the right time. It can be kind of repetitive. Seamus McGarvey's cinematography really saves this film. It looks great and really captures the grand scale of Godzilla. He makes great use of blacks and reds throughout the film. Edward's 'Godzilla' is a blockbuster reboot that looks great, but has a weak story. The film is at its best when Godzilla holds the screen. It'll wow you.",6,1,2,23 July 2014
