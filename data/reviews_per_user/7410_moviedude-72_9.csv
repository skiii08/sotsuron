The Blair Witch Project," A petrifying nightmare...
","PLOT: In October of 1994, three film students travel to Maryland to make a film about a local urban legend coined as the Blair Witch, equipped with a camera, tents and very little communication with the outside world. After days in the Maryland woods, things begin to appear outside their tent (i.e. stones and sticks) and strange noises occur during the cold nights. Eventually, they disappear, and a year later their footage is found, pieced together it becomes....The Blair Witch Project.During the scariest of The Blair Witch Project moments we see nothing at all; the screen is pitch black. What we hear are the panicked voices of the film crew while outside their tent things go bump in the night. The combination of the distant noises and the raw fear in the voices will throw a chill into anyone's blood. The success of the film is not of blood, gore, nor is it special effects, but of the suggestion that something evil and supernatural occupies the dark shadows in the Maryland woods, and we can easily be terrified of them without ever having to see them. By using hand-held cameras and invigorating impromptu, there is a feeling of real life that accompanies these people on their journey, something sinister.The directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are genuine and talented. And its even more perfect that they had a tight budget, because the poor camera work makes it all seem like a documentary, like its all real. (no wonder people are still asking questions like 'is this real?') The cast does a credible job, more or less playing themselves. Heather Donahue is a strong and determine character, and gives the film's most powerful performance (particularly in the film's most intense scene towards the end, which will stick in your mind). However, there's little noticeable difference between Josh and Mike. Both actors manage to make their characters seem like real people...but they are real people we never know anything about.Overall, the central question of any horror film is: Is the movie scary? With The Blair Witch Project, the answer is undoubtedly, yes! It's certainly a welcome departure from the modern horror film, which have all too often replaced terror with mere gore (not realizing that disgust makes a pitiful substitute for fear). The Blair Witch Project is atmospheric, creepy and very unsettling. It may start off slow (particularly for modern audiences who are use to non stop gore), but the movie becomes more unsettling the longer it goes on, and builds up to one terrifying, devastatingly effective climax.9.3/10 See It If You Liked: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980)",7,1,2,11 August 2006
Requiem for a Dream," The power of this film astounds me; a must see!
","Requiem for a Dream is a very difficult film to describe, simply because it evokes some many emotions, which says a lot about the power the film has. The power can affect the viewer in different ways, and you really need to be willing to put yourself through what is undeniably a profoundly disturbing experience - as a lot of this film is quite graphic. However, since I'm always ready for a new cinema experience, I saw this film, and when it finished, it left me speechless, I was amazed at what I'd witnessed, and glad in the same way.The director, Darren Aronofsky (of 'Pi', 1998), clearly knows the effects of certain addictions, and explores three peoples lives (that are in some way connected) from New York City, who have addictions of their own, and how these addictions cause the their simultaneous downfall. Most of them where blessed with a fairly good future in life, however this was completely destroyed after they began to rely on certain drugs to get along. These people are Harry (played by Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are a couple of small-time drug users who get an idea to become dealers themselves. Marion (played by Oscar-winner Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend, who gradually gets hooked on their product. Sara Goldfarb (played by Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's mother who receives a call telling her she's won a contest and will appear on a popular television game show. She becomes obsessed with losing weight to fit into an old red dress and becomes hooked on diet pills, after several other diets she experiments with fail. These four fall so far so gruesomely into misfortune, basically ruining their lives...and how this happens is shown so very explicitly, yet it has a purpose, it isn't in any way trying to be pretentious or over the top, and it effectively displays the effects their addictions have had on them.One of the many things that makes Requiem for a Dream great is its and extremely original visual style, ranging from those amazing signature looks, from rapid-fire montage editing to dizzying shots with the camera strapped to the actor's chest, to show the viewer what the actor may have been seeing during that certain scene. Another film that does a bona-fide job of holding the film up is the dazzling, emotionally powerful performances, especially from Burstyn, who received a richly deserved (!) Oscar-nomination for her performance, in fact, it may be her best performance, along with The Exorcist (1973) and The Straight Story (1999). Hers is the most touching character, the one who takes the highest fall, and the supporting performances from Leto, Connelly and Wayans, who all  I believed  merited Oscar nominations for their own great performances. I could honestly go on and on about what makes Requiem great, and powerful, but I really don't need to, I felt the whole movie was amazing.All up, I will said Requiem for a Dream is an amazing experience, it had a profound impact on me (but it is all worth it), and I'm sure it will on you, if you see it, which I recommend you do some time soon! Definitely suitable for the most ardent fan of drama.9.8/10 See It if You Liked: Kids (1995), Basketball Diaires (1993), Girl Interrupted (1999).-Luke Rowe",10,15,24,19 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Good, but nothing above that.
","The story begins in Wyoming in 1963, when Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are 19 years old and get a job tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain. Ennis is a boy of so few words he can barely open his mouth to release them; he learned to be guarded and fearful long before he knew what he feared. Jack, who has done some rodeo riding, is a little more outgoing, and likes to have fun. After some days have passed on the mountain and some whiskey has been drunk, they suddenly and almost violently have sex. After the day fades away Ennis tells Jack 'This is a one-shot thing we got going on here,'Ennis says the next day. Jack agrees. But it's far from that. After summer, they part. A while after their boss Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) tells Jack he doesn't want him to return next summer. Many years pass and Jack and Ennis get married to different people, not seeing each other a while after Jack sends a postcard to Ennis saying he'll be in town (Wyoming). They begin a routine were they pretend to go fishing on mountainside and secretly they act out their secret passion. One day, Ennis's wife Alma (Michaelle Williams), suspects there is more than a friendship between the two. After they both learn that they have an intimate relasionship, which is ruined after a tragedy that will engulf their long, secret relasionship.The movie is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx. I'm not familirar with it, but since this film was so acclaimed, I though I should just see it, and I did. I didn't particularly enjoy it all over, it was an average film. The performances where outstanding, but I really failed to see what everyone else saw in this film. The scenery is outstanding, along with the performances, that's another good thing, in the world beyond Jack and Ennis' relationship, love and tenderness are rarely found. That's a flaw in this finely crafted film, though it does serve to emphasize the unparalleled importance Jack and Ennis' relationship has in their lives. My only advice is to watch some of Ang Lee's better films, such as The Ice Storm. Now, that is far superior work. To me Brokeback did not live up to the immense hype. Sorry, but I just did not like it that much.6/10",6,18,23,27 February 2006
The Shining," A legendary horror film, from a legendary director
","'The Shining' is one of the finest horror films ever made, and one of Stanley Kubrick's most amazing achievements (however there was many more). It was the only horror movie Kubrick ever made, which may be positive on our part; because he was always motivated by a style that seldom had seen reproduction from other filmmakers, this allows one to look at the product from a neutral perspective, canceling out all standard comparisons to other horror movies, especially those that were also tailored from Stephen King novels (although King himself thinks Kubrick's adaptation of his novel was butchery, for some reason?). To say that the picture is one of a kind is accurate, but one in a million feels even more appropriate. It is in that small handful of the scariest horror movies ever made, and it distances itself from the typical 'slasher' genre, which is now very tiring, because no remake in made in the 2000s can beat out the original 1970s/1980s version.Another equally amazing thing is, after all this time, is how well Kubrick used his actors, music and visuals to underscore the themes of the story itself. The technical details are prototypes in themselves, helping the story build massive tension; the long hallway shots, the eerie musical score, the use of words written backwards, the implication of a blizzard, and the tall, wide staircases establish a sense of uncertainty for both the audience and the individuals in the movie. Each of the characteristics are also evidence of the haunting craftsmanshipthe photography of the hotel, for instance, creates a portrait of breathtaking beauty long before the breakdown of the characters' lucidity chars our attraction to it.The performances are just brilliant, but with the exception of Shelly Duvaull, while her performance as a caring mother is good, her mousy screams get very overacted, and tedious after a while. But Jack Nicholson was AMAZING in this film, his performance was strong, believable and terrifying. It is easily his best performance to date!Overall, everything in The Shinning works brilliantly. Full of brilliant psychological scares and flawless imagery.10/10",10,15,25,15 October 2006
American Beauty," Beautifully crafted, near-perfect film
","The film chronicals Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis, decides to turn his hectic life around after developing an infatuation for his daughter's Lolita-like attractive friend.No film has created a bigger advance stir than American Beauty, and, for once, the product lives up to its buzz. The film is a dynamite comedy-drama and along with 'Eyes Wide Shut', 'Girl, Interrupted', 'Election' and 'Boys Don't Cry', the best films of 1999. It's so daring and original that it would've been impossible to predict how it would do commercially back in 1999. On the surface, it's such an uncompromisingly bleak look at the hollowness of the American Dream and suburbia that audiences may just turn off to it and masse. But it's also hilarious, directed with a breathtaking flair (Sam Mendes who directed last years Jarhead) and fuelled by a career-defining performance from Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning. It also rises above its darkness to make an affirmation of life that's so exquisite it's hard to resist.On the surface, American Beauty is a brilliantly acted and inventive satire, with an amazingly perfect supporting cast that includes Thora Birch and Mena Suvuri. One of thing I found strange about the film was it's similarity to Ang Lee's bitter and amazingly brilliant 'The Ice Storm' (released two years earlier), despite the former being a more realistic tke on American life; none the less American Beauty was still a flat-out masterwork (with a few flaws), I highly recommend it.9.8/10 See It If You Liked: The Ice Storm, Happiness, The Virgin Suicides and Blue Velvet",9,1,2,11 July 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Another knockout film from Tarentino!
","PLOT OUTLINE: 'The Bride', who was once the deadliest assassin of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, until the day she decided to leave the business, assume a new identity, and get married. But it was on the day of her marriage that her old 'friends' - O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Budd (Michael Madsen), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and her boss, Bill, decided to crash the wedding, killing everyone there...and putting a gun to the Bride's head, however she did not die. She is just in a coma, and is about to wake up, and travel to Tokyo, Japan and begin her revenge on the five people apart of the team that The Bride herself was once apart of. Kill Bill: Vol 1 is about a young woman bent on revenge. But it's also about the screen return of Quentin Tarentino, the most outrageous American filmmakers working today, and one of my favorites. 'Working today' may be a stretch because 'Bill' is his first film in over five years, since 1997's Jackie Brown. And it certainly looks like Q.T. has been hard at work, filling every scene of 'Bill' with meticulous detail and over-directing in his manic style. The writer/director again shows a lack of cinematic originality, while maintaining his genius for action-packed, 1970s Japanese style violence and entertainment.Kill Bill is a lot of fun. Hardly a dull moment goes by. But that underlines the obvious fact that the film is all surface, full of gun-fights, boffo martial arts sequences, and with virtually nothing to think about. It's the proverbial assault on the senses, as you're given a queasy stomach to get you going before Tarentino graduates to repulsion through sight, sound, smell and even taste.The performance by Uma Thurman is fierce, she is a beautiful, and an extremely talented actress. Lucy Liu and the rest of the supporting cast also give in sharp performances.Overall, Kill Bill Vol: 1 is easily one of my favorite films of 2003, and its also responsible for making me a devoted Tarentino fan (no I hadn't seen Pulp Fiction before this!). The film is a grind house of sharp dialouge, set design and over the top gore which is done so magically, and put together perfectly. A true classic.10/10See It If You Like: Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Fight Club-Luke Rowe",8,0,2,13 August 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," A refreshing, beautiful work of art
","2001: A Space Odyssey is a meditative quest, an inspirational sci-fi film that defies its genre in scope and attitude; it is a film of tremendous visual impact and innovation. It was done before Star Wars and at a time when sci-fi films were mostly low-budget productions. It one of Kubrick's finest films, and it is a refreshing break from the typical science fiction films you see today, this one has so much depth and there is a message, it isn't just about explosions or implosions.The film, ultimately, is about the need mankind has to transcend its limited thinking and move into dimensions that are greater than its narrow aims. It is not a pessimistic film as some have suggested, neither is it an optimistic film; it is a film based on self-discovery and intellect and contemplation. It is one of the great original works of cinema, maybe even the best; it is a film that is not even a bit dated as I took my VHS copy from 2001 out of my movie collection and viewed it once again in a few weeks ago; still to be awed by the spectacle, the accuracy of its scientific statements, and its mystery.When you view this film for the first time, it is perplexing, and will have you ruptured, it is quite hard to interpretate what it's actually trying to tell you. However it is open to interpretation, there have been many answers and questions, perhaps more questions than answers. It is mainly about man, and who we continue to kill to protect our territory so we can survive. The question is, will our evolution into the Star Child (seen at the end of the film) change anything or will mans nature remain the same? See how it raises more questions than it answers.2001 has had an amazing impact on Hollywood and pop culture and has spawned countless rip off and spoof versions over the years. Because it will always stand as the greatest of all sci-fi movies, and perhaps the one that holds the best plot...even if it will take you forever to work out what it's actually about it.My only complaint what so ever was the pacing, the film can become considerably slow at times, however that is understandable because Kubrick was trying to depict an accurate journey in space, and understandably couldn't be rounded of too quickly....and sometimes it's nice to just watch the beautiful cinematography unfold in front o your eyes and let it dazzle you.Overall, 2001 is brilliantly conceived work, and is a visually, breathtaking work of art, it is certainly one of Kubrick's greatest. It may contain flaws, but hey, what film doesn't? It will retain its status as a artistic masterpiece for god knows how long.9/10",10,1,3,25 September 2006
Pulp Fiction," Complex and confronting, but still a masterpiece
","In the minds of most people, Pulp Fiction is a collection of recycled movie scenes, punctuated by extreme violence, 70's music, and pop culture references. That's supposedly all it takes to make a Quentin Tarantino movie. Yet, how many movies have there been since which have copied this 'formula' that are as fresh, energetic, alive and exciting? None. Pulp Fiction remains the best movie of the 1994, and perhaps the decade.Director and co-writer Quentin Tarantino is courteous enough to credit the viewer with some intelligence. As in his previous 'Reservoir Dogs', he and writer Roger Avary create a web of events and characters that ultimately all play parts of a larger story, they connect. This time the tale is far more sprawling and complex, but it also rewards and satisfies.Every actor in Pulp Fiction gives a career-topping performance in every role (has Bruce Willis ever been better? Uma Thurman, she was great in Kill Bill though). Travolta especially shines, back in top form after years of bad movies. His smooth, underconfident junkie Vincent Vega is our link to all three stories. He 'plays' a different character depending on who he's on screen with. He talks jivey when on screen with Jules, cool when with Mia Wallace, and tough in his brief scene with Butch. He doesn't have the confidence to be himself at any time. It's a great performance. When Vincent and Jules begin the movie by hassling the three young cons, they 'get into character' before entering the room. Jackson is mesmerizing as Jules, fearsome and religious. Frank Whaley, Steve Buscemi, Peter Green, and Christopher Walken also appear in bit parts.Overall, not for the squeamish and light hearted, but not to be written off or underestimated, this is riveting and discomforting storytelling. It can be a difficult, rattling experience, but this reviewer has found its rewards to vastly outweigh its weaknesses, Pulp Fiction is a landmark film and the director has created a wonderfully, rich, diverse satire of violence and campy black humor...combined with a awesome soundtrack.See It If You Liked: Natural Born Killers, Go, Reservoir Dogs10/10-Luke Rowe",10,1,2,11 August 2006
Scream," A highly entreating and intelligent teenage slasher
","PLOT: A psychopathic serial killer is stalking a group of teenagers in a quite and peaceful American town, just like in the movies, first threatening them with scary phone calls.John Carpenter's 1978 classic 'Halloween' is responsible for Scream, and before you watch Scream you're probably going to wonder whether this is another one of those unoriginal Halloween knock-offs with over the top gore. Well, I must let you know that it is far from that. Scream is a 1990s style teenage slasher movie with just enough tongue-in-cheek understanding of its own silliness to make it gruesomely fun without being insulting or boring and full of nonsense. It's a hip, stylish and expertly filmed, original slasher.Directed by Wes Craven, king of teenage horror (e.g. A Nightmare on Elm Street) has delivered a winner. He has managed to make a movie that is both genuine scary movie and arch parody of scary movies. It's the film's very self-awareness that makes it different from all the rest. Instead of following the time-honored horror rules that it so carefully details, it leads them - the virgin is immune from death, we are told, but what if she gives it up? Well, you can guess the rest. Craven also owes a great deal to Kevin Williamson's first-rate script, a witty and smart piece of horror comedy that makes him worthy of the career he gained after this.The performances are some of the best I've witnessed in a horror film, Neve Campbell (how come we don't see more of this girl?) manages to pull off a tormented, innocent teenager with a lot on her plate. The rest of the cast brings up some memorable performances, especially Rose McGowan who plays Tatum, my favourite character. Among the rest of the cast is Friends actress Courtney Cox, Matthew Lillard, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and how could I forget Drew Barrymore, electrifying cute Scream queen (sadly she dies about 10 minuets into the film).Overall, Scream is a great entertaining movie. However, you must keep in mind that it isn't meant to be taken seriously, as there is nothing too universal or groundbreaking in the film. Despite that, on its own merit it's a classic slasher film. And you can see the films legacy in its dozen of boring imitators (Urban Legend, Valentine and I Know What You Did Last Summer).9.5/10 See It If You Liked: I Know What You Did Last Summer, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Urban Legend.",9,2,3,31 August 2006
