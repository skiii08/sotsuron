Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Really, Really Funny
","This film is funny. Flat out gross and offensive humor entirely. If you are offended by things easily, you will probably not like this film. I, also was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of Borat last night and I left laughing AND feeling like I needed a shower. Permit me to quote one of my friends (that also saw the film) in that, 'That was the best piece of smut I've ever seen,' in order to illustrate a better sense of what the movie is like.Borat never fails to be completely out of place in the film and never afraid to speak his mind. Gross. Entertaining. Hilarious.I don't want to give anything away, but if you like to laugh at Borat and the wonderful people he meets along his journey, get pumped for some funny stuff.",Null,5,12,22 September 2006
