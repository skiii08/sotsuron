The Rock," Great Action Flick
","O.M.G.!!! (oh my god). The first time i saw The Rock, my best friend rented it, and brought it over. I thought it wasn't really going to be that good, because i was never really interested in stories about Alcatraz... boy was i lookin dumb!!!! The Rock is about the best, next to Face/Off, action film i have ever seen, in my life. On a four star scale of stars, of 1 to 4, i give this Great Action Flick: * * * * *!!!",Null,1,1,11 January 1999
Fight Club," Damn!
","Spoiler...When i first saw Fight Club, my friend had to explain it to me. I didnt see how Someone could imagine someone was there, or imagin watching himself as someone else, without knowing. I also didn't understand why he couldnt just concentrait real hard and Tyler would just go away. Once he explained it to me, I re-watched it and it is now one of my Favorite flicks. i give it 100 stars out of 10.",Null,0,1,7 April 2001
Face_Off," This movie kicks butt!
","I love Face/Off. I'll admit I thought it was going to suck, because Nicholas Cage was making Con Air at the same time, but it ended up that Con Air was the worse of the two. I just want to say that Face/ Off is the best action movie I've ever seen",Null,0,0,28 February 1999
