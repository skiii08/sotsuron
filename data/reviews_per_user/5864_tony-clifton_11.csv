Requiem for a Dream," A Brilliant Accomplishment
","This film artfully portrays the dreams and aspirations of 4 interconnected characters in a very revealing visual way not done before.  I highly recommend it for those who like to think long and hard about a movie long after the credits roll.The only problem I had with the film was the drug-use visualization, I thought it was clever the first few times, but the scene was repeated so many times it became a bore.  One should always know when to quit.",Null,0,1,20 June 2003
Dark City," Perfect Sci Fi movie
","This is the perfect sci fi movie.  Amazingly imaginative and thought-provoking premise and plot and artfully executed.  I love the 30s feel.  To enjoy the movie, you should be prepared to think and appreciate what the director/writer was trying to achieve - sure it's dark but that's the point isn't it?",10,0,3,10 June 2003
Pi," Oh My Gosh this movie is BORING
","This is the first film in my history that I rented and have stopped watching, in fact I stopped watching after only 20 minutes.  This film plays like a documentary and for crying out loud, a documentary about Mathematics is NOT interesting!  And I studied Engineering Math!A film ought to be at least one of several things, it should either be entertaining or of a documentary about a topic of interest.  For me this film was neither.  And I found the over-exposed B&W cinematography to be very unwatchable to boot.Bleh - a terrible film!",1,9,17,20 June 2003
Saw II," See Saw 2 (but see Saw too before you see Saw 2)
","This Halloween see Saw 2 but see Saw before you see Saw 2 to understand what you saw. Not see-saw, but see Saw before you see Saw 2. If you saw Saw too, you must see Saw 2 to see the conclusion of what you saw. If you already saw Saw 2, then go see Saw too to make sense of Saw 2. So when you're out next to see a movie, see Saw 2 Â– not see-saw 2 but see Saw 2, but not before you see Saw.What I saw in Saw 2 was different to when I saw Saw. Although we see Jigsaw who we see in Saw too return to Saw 2, what we see is a psychotic sequel superior to Saw and scarier too. If you loved seeing Saw, you would love to see the Saw sequel: Saw 2",10,0,4,3 November 2005
This Is Spinal Tap," The funniest movie ever made!!!
","Absolutely hilarious. You must see this movie. The lines are great, the situations are funny. Totally enjoyable. Nothing more to say!! 10/10.There were so many great scenes, it's hard to mention a top one, but some of my favourites include the Stonehenge concert, and the concert where one of them gets stuck in the capsule. Everything was done so realistically it's like War of the Worlds with a rock band. Rob Reiner and the Cast are geniuses. It wouldn't have worked without perfect acting, and thankfully everyone's acting was spot on and utterly believable.I love this movie!",10,0,3,16 January 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Not Enjoyable at All
","It disturbs me that a lot of these 10/10 reviews rave on about the 'ultraviolence' and sex.  Now I do not have a problem with art - I have no problem with realistic portrayal either - but to extol the art of a film because it is violent or has sexual content, debases the people who do so into carnal savages.Is it so wrong that in the 21st Century, with all the misery and destruction, that we learn to elevate our culture and society to have some self-respect and compassion?  Evidently when someone gleefully watches 'A Clockwork Orange' delving delightfully in its violence, that being a better person isn't a virtue worth striving for for that person.On to the movie review: Malcolm McDowell plays one of the most hateable characters I've ever watched - and one can only naturally congratulate Malcolm for his acting talent.  However, the rest of the film is only average.  Perhaps in the 70s it may have been brilliant for the cinematography but I find the themes very basic.  There's certainly nothing extraordinary about this film at all.  Stories like '1984' or 'Metropolis' would be considered brilliant in conception and vision, but 'A Clockwork Orange' has nary a thought that would cause one to pause more than a second of afterthought.  The concept of removing one's free will to do evil was very poorly conveyed and it never once caused me to ponder it.I just get this feeling that there is really nothing great about this film at all, and so all these animalistic fans of violence-for-the-sake-of-violence make up all these so-called qualities for this film just to pad their reviews so it's not so obvious how so lacking in substance this film really is.  A film like 'Brazil' for instance, covers the themes of 'A Clockwork Orange' so brilliantly that one thinks about how it relates to society.  'A Clockwork Orange' does nothing to relate to the real world since it poorly relates anything except for some brute violence.  Whoopie-doo.In fact the only thing that makes fans of this film rave on about this film is the violence and the fact that it was banned.  Yawn.  Let's move on shall we?  4/10",4,5,13,20 June 2003
Castle in the Sky," My Favourite Animated film ever
","This story is so magical from beginning to end.  First, it's based on a 'Final Fantasy' type world where everything is steam powered including outlandish machinery like flying 'battleships' and marries it with beautiful Switzerland-like rolling hills and green meadows.  Secondly it involves a charming innocent romantic story involving two kids involved in an adventure way beyond their wildest dreams.  Third - when you combine that with the unforgettable music of Joe Hisaishi you've simply got the most magical animated film ever made.Go see it!",10,1,1,10 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Deus Ex Macchina
","Deus Ex Macchina - or 'God in the machine', a term used by the Greeks to describe an overly contrived script.This movie, along with its pathetic first movie is a great big joke.  The fact that so many people cannot see how bad the story line is, is testament to how low standards of story-telling have fallen.How pathetic it was for HP to suddenly and conveniently win the battle at the end of the first movie by touching someone's face - and the lame-o explanation given is 'it was a mother's love' - WHAT?As if the weak 'Independence Day' type ending of the first movie was not bad enough, the second one ends even worse - a stupid bird flies in at the last minute to destroy the big bad snake!  WHAT?  Independence Day - 'Secret Weapon' all over again!Also - what a total ripoff Dobby was to Gollum.  For crying out loud, I think it was too much of a coincidence that a giant spider is in the second book of The Lord of the Rings - and surprise surprise, a giant spider in the second book of HP.  Gollum betrays his master, Dobby betrays his.  Both are similar looking, wearing tattered clothing - or for pete's sake.Oh how the standards have fallen.1/10 - and the 1 is for the special effects.",1,14,30,28 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Superb! But what's with all the '1' ratings?
","After I voted, I saw with amazement a number of people who voted '1'. What's up with that?  I reserve '1' for a really bad movie like 'Hard Target' - acclaimed movies with tremendous epic value like any of the Lord of the Rings movies do not deserve a '1'.  If you don't like the genre - then that's not the fault of the film.  Neither is it the fault of the film if you don't like the battles.  Movies should be judged based on what the director was trying to achieve, and in that respect - how does Return of the King deserve a '1'??The only reason I can think of, is some people are losers who have nothing better to do, or can't stand Return of the King out-ranking 'The Godfather' or some other corny reason.  Grow up kiddies!Anyway - back to the movie.  I thought the movie was breathtaking!  It certainly is an apt finale to a wonderful trilogy.  Unlike others - I didn't find the film dragged on too long, and the length was respectful to the essence of Tolkien's story.*minor spoiler*The only thing I was wondering is: why didn't Frodo just ride on one of those Eagles straight into Mordor from the beginning in the first place? Then it occurred to me: the Eagle would stand out flying into Mordor, and would have set off too many alarms.  Also, it appeared when the eye looks at you, you become paralyzed - so I guess the Eagles would have been affected by that.*end spoiler*Anyway - the wait has not ended for me.  The 'real' trilogy is the extended DVD set and until the extended Return of the King comes out, the journey has not really ended yet for me.  Boo hoo.(man did I wait 2 whole years before I saw the end??  I bet none of you thought you could have waited that long!!)",10,0,0,19 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Stop comparing the trilogy to Star Wars - the idea is LUDICROUS!
","1) the Lord of the Rings was written in the 1950s 2) George Lucas is a huge fan of Tolkien 3) George Lucas likes the Lord of the Rings so much, he made a clone movie (good pun right?) called 'Willow' - remember? 4) a lot of the themes and plot elements of the Star Wars trilogy are in fact BASED on the the Lord of the Rings: a) old teacher 'dies' in first movie but doesn't really b) second installment ends in a cliff-hanger (the original 'Two Towers' novel ends in a big cliff-hanger') c) last installment surrounds the 'Return' of something - I mean COME ON - Return of the Jedi:Return of the King!!!So to compare the two series is ridiculous, especially by some who think Star Wars is actually better!  To think that is to insult Tolkien and his influence he had over George Lucas.By the way The Return of the King rocks!  I will give a more detailed review later.",10,0,1,19 December 2003
Life," People didn't like it because the creature didn't seem realistic
","I've been reading reviews of this movie and it seemed many people didn't like it because they thought this carbon/water based creature was unrealistic. Nothing can survive the vacuum of space, extreme cold and extreme heat, no water and food for years, etc... but there IS an organism that can do that. It's called a 'tardigrade' - this little creature can survive lethal amounts of radiation, 1 degree above absolute zero temperature, it can turn its body into glass to survive extreme dehydration, it can survive the vacuum of space and the pressure of many hundreds of meters underwater and survive above boiling temperature.Coincidentally, shortly after learning about this fascinating creature I came across the movie 'Life', and that's probably why I love it so much. What would happen if a hostile alien with the durability of a tardigrade and a lethality of a xenomorph decided to hunt us down? I was thrilled at the prospect! Although some will fault some of the poor choices of the characters, I found them on par with the choices of 'Alien:Covenant' characters, but I wasn't going to fault the movie because the premise intrigued me so much. I for one, found it an exciting and thrilling movie!!",9,191,273,14 August 2017
