Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Is everyone a lemming?! This film is pretty dreadful!
","I saw Vol. 1 the other night and was absolutely dazzled! It's not because I like action -- in fact, I rather don't -- it's that Vol. 1 is masterful, creative film-making, with almost impossible attention to detail (both visual and aural) and an anfractuous script that is perfectly crafted. I just saw Vol. 2, however, and I came on this site to see what people had to say...and I'm SHOCKED by you all! I can only guess that people responded to seeing character development in Vol. 2 --as ridiculous as it is (tell me, where oh where is there ANY real depth, ANY earned feeling?) -- that was withheld (intentionally, as it was unnecessary to what Vol. 1 is) in its predecessor. What is that at the end: 'All is right in the jungle / The cub is with her mother' or something like that...Are you kidding me?! Are you people sheep?! Did this touch your heart or something? I'd think that Q's had a big joke on anyone if it weren't that it would be much too much trouble to go through. The whole training thing was nothing more than a redux of that kind of thing in martial-arts movies -- not an homage, not something new, just a redux. In fact, this is the whole movie: redux. Truth serum?! A hidden snake?! All that exposition?! And as far as the action, why bother, if you're gonna step down so far from Vol. 1?! QT ran out of steam. I know he wasn't TRYING to make Vol. 2 like Vol. 1...but he should have. Or maybe not. It seems the masses -- after all, the same people who somehow call themselves film fans while watching the Oscars year after year even though they give Kevin Costener Best Director for 'Dances With Wolves' over Martin Scorsese for 'Goodfellas' -- can't tell the difference.

Reservoir Dogs," I'm afraid Tarentino will never equal this fab work
","Okay, okay:  the gunplay and the poses are from Woo, the climax has been downright lifted from 'City on Fire'; but this film has enough that's original -- and improves upon most of that which is lifts -- to make it stand on its own.  A lot of wonderful dialog here (the opening alone is enough), great casting and characters -- and what about making a caper film which has no caper?!  Lovely.  But there is one moment which TRULY is brilliant:  a fictional story (told by Tim Roth's character) which is developed and devolved until the storyteller stands in the middle of his story telling it to its characters as the camera spins 'round and 'round. One of the most-inspired moments in the history of filmmaking.",8,0,1,24 May 1999
