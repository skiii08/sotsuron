Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An introduction to the greatest fairy tale in cinema history
","I went to see this film on the first night that it came out (travelling half way across the country to do so!) and I felt thoroughly entertained when I went to see it and came out wanting more from the rest of the prequel instalments. I was very happy with the performances in the movie particularly Ian McDiarmid and my only gripe is the under utilisation of Terence Stamp as Supreme Chancellor (remember General Zod in Superman II?).George Lucas has given an excellent base for the rest of the trilogy with this film providing the foundation for the tragedy, which will unfold in the galaxy and the love of Padme and Anakin. I watch the original trilogy regularly and it is very much my belief that the first audience George Lucas has aimed at are children with each of the films being a 'U' certificate.  Many of us who have grown up with the Star Wars franchise as part of popular culture are now mature adults.  Those of us who were young when this film was released are now more cynical about the world and about cinema.  We've moved on from the late seventies when the first film was released to universal acclaim and unfortunately it is difficult to see how anyone could produce a film with the overall appeal of Star Wars in the new millennium. This is a sad thought but I believe George Lucas will build on the platform of this movie with Episodes II & III.",Null,0,1,11 October 2001
Memento," A unique conundrum of a movie
",A simply brilliant construction on celluloid.  This film hasn't a plot or a narrative to speak of in the traditional sense.  It speaks to it's audience through the confusion of the central character and we slowly unravel the facts of his existence in a world where he trusts no-one.  The mystery of the film makes it a little reminiscent of 'The Usual Suspects' where Kevin Spacey beguiles us with his narration but the truth is this film is a one-off in a genre of it's own.,8,0,1,16 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Greatest Saga of Science Fiction back with a bang!!!
","All elements of this film build on the foundation of the first film.  I felt also when watching this that the new trilogy is gathering pace towards it's climax.  The cast is improved from the first film with Christopher Lee giving a glorious performance as the machiavellian Count Dooku.  It's great to have a classic English actor playing a central role in a Star Wars film again.  I have to say that in the lead up to the film I wasn't convinced but well done to Hayden Christensen for pulling it off.  He has given the role of Anakin Skywalker the requisite brilliance, impetuousness and petulance that will ultimately lead him to the Dark Side of the Force.  Padme is again played almost as a 'mini-Leia' by the gifted Natalie Portman (we await her performance in the last instalment of the trilogy).  The relationship between Anakin and Padme is dealt with tenderly and with clarity over their difficulties.  For very different reasons they struggle to deal with their feelings for one another.  By the end of the film the light sabre battle has to be seen to be believed and if that is all your interested in then you will not feel short changed.  All in all a magnificent follow up to the low-key Phantom Menace and I await the time when I can watch all six films back to back at my local cinema!",9,0,0,16 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Simply the greatest
","I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this film in awe rewinding the vcr to catch scenes again.  It is one of the few films ever to have made an indelible mark on popular culture with it's script even being referenced in the tv mafia drama 'The Sopranos'. Al Pacino's performance is unbelievable emanating the coldness of death that is alluded to in the novel.  Pacino is able to build upon the script to make Michael Corleone one of the greatest characters ever seen on celluloid.  His performance alone is worth watching by itself.  Michael's ascent to the top of the mafia in America and his descent in his family is the essence of this film.  Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall are excellent with John Cazale giving notice of his immense talent which was tragically never fully realised due to his premature death through illness.  The script is itself magnificent particularly where Michael and Fredo are together in the family home, Hyman Roth's (Lee Strasberg) speech on 'who gave the order' and Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) apparent first use of 'make him an offer he can't refuse'.  The script helps to make this film the natural completion of the 'Godfather' saga.  The third film is an irrelevance in the company of two of the greatest film's ever made as it is only average.  There may never be a better film made or story written as 'The Godfather Part II'.",10,0,0,29 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good, but not that good
",This was a good movie experience nothing more and nothing less.The story is well told and reflects well on the Tolkien fantasies (of which I am a fan). The performances here are nothing to speak of and there is little of a collective nature about the cast despite 'The Fellowship'.  The special effects are superb and the landscapes are stunning (in fact altogether the best thing about the film). The story though is not as effective as the action sequences and barely gets under the skin of the book.  I am looking forward to more of Peter Jackson's magnificent scenery and special effects in the following episodes.,8,0,0,27 January 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," A good film on a difficult topic
","Few films bother with this topic and its no surprise given the lack of opportunity to develop standard Hollywood formula. Angelina Jolie steals the show here but the supporting cast is very solid. Despite her awards for this movie, I believe Angelina Jolie will develop into the foremost actress of her generation over the next few years.",Null,1,1,14 October 2001
