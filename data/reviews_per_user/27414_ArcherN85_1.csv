Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch and Censoring
","After waiting months to see this movie, Sucker Punched opened today in theaters and I finally got to see this film. While the previews can be a little misleading to what this film is about or where the story takes place, but that's it's purpose. Sucker Punch delivered an incredible Plot Twist that I was not expecting and the movie was Visually EPIC and engaging! Try to see this film in IMAX just to further enjoy the journey. Even though this film was not what I was expecting and the ending caught me a little off guard and I did enjoy the film. Sucker Punch is definitely worth seeing in theaters at least once! However Hollywood is really pushing that PG-13 Rating with Sucker Punch which should have never been censored in the first place and remained Rated R! I would not recommend anyone under the age of 16 to see this film because even though they do not show the 'sex scenes' and they muffle the cursing and somethings don't get shown completely, I'd like to think that teenagers are not that stupid and they'll understand whats going on. Sucker Punch should have been Rated R and not cut out all the good stuff and a vital scene that helps the ending make more sense. Hopefully when Sucker Punch comes out on DVD and Blu-Ray it will have the uncensored version!",9,6,14,25 March 2011
