Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Best movie of all time
","I consider Kill Bill 1 and 2 one movie and this movie is the best movie of all time hands down.  Tarantino is simply brilliant with every aspect of this movie.  I feel I owe him more money watching these films, the regular admission price is not enough to charge for a piece of art like this. The whole movie was perfectly cast and the storyline was orchestrated with surgeon like precision. When she was in the coffin how many of you thought 'How is she going to get out of this?' then they cut perfectly to her training and it all made sense. When she finally got to Bill you almost have this feeling they may actually get back together. I've seen thousands of movies in my life and this is at the top of my list, until the tarantino movie comes out. Please Quentin, make movies more often, i need your movies!!!!",10,1,2,17 April 2004
