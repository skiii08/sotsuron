","This movie was absolutely fantastic! I haven't laughed OUT LOUD at a movie in a long time. Oh, sorry, not a comedy? Oops. The improbability of the plot is made even more pitiful by my realization half-way through the movie that a) most 'red-blooded' Americans would think this a true morality play and b) numerous reviewers would rave rave rave about 'finding the lost classic Western' blah blah blah. Had the pleasure of seeing this one with a bunch of surgeon-friends who guffawed most at the point-blank abdominal gun shot wound. 'Oh wait, he's going to pull the bullet out and put it in a metal cup so we hear that clinking noise, and, oh yes, that will make it all better! Wait, wait....YES!! Ah ha ha ha!!!!'",2,6,12,19 January 2008
