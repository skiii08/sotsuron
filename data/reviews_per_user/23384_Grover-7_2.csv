The Blair Witch Project," Very Disappointing
","I was extremely excited, and nervous, to see this movie.  All the mystery and hype about The Blair Witch Project had cast a spell on me.  I couldn't wait to see it.  Then I did.  With each passing minute I kept waiting to feel scared, but it never happened.  I liked the idea of the actors filming the movie, and the dialogue was fresh as it was unscripted.  I was even one of the people who actually thought this stuff happened and that some of the footage was actually from the missing students.  Even with that mentality, I was not frightened.  I was using my imagination at full throttle, and the movie just left me empty.  I guess the ending was good for one reason: it was consistent with the rest of the movie.  I kept saying to myself, 'Something good is going to happen now.....' right up to the ending. After seeing the ending, nothing good happened.  I give it an 10/10 for marketing, 6/10 for the concept, but only 2/10 for the film itself.  One last thing...I read a Hollywood review saying that this movie is the scariest since The Exorcist...there is no way that statement is true.",3,0,2,11 August 1999
Forrest Gump," How could you not love this movie!
",This movie is simply wonderful!  Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance in this American history on video.  All supporting actors are well-cast. I'm disappointed that it's not ranked higher in the Top 250.,10,0,2,12 August 1999
