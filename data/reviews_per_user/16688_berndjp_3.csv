Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," 'Lame' sums everything up about this movie
","For the not so demanding movie goer this might be just enough to be entertained, for anyone slightly more choosy this film is rather lame to say the least. Most elements are foreseeable, while poorly acted and story-wise unnecessary in parts. This movie is Hollywood by the numbers, an overly long fast food production without real content and an offense to the previously established characters and franchise. If you are watching this to see another part of the franchise, this might work for you. If you're watching this, expecting a good pirate movie with twists and turns and witty dialogues, you will be disappointed.",1,0,1,30 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I can't look past the plot holes
","As a movie enthusiast, i welcome a fresh take on established stories, another director's vision, toying with themes and so on. But what i would expect in return is a captivating story, which is intellectually challenging or philosophically interesting, not just eye candy. If the latter is enough for you, you might be able to forgive deviations from the SW universe, overlook the huge plot holes and the lack of character development. Unfortunately, I can't and I should have followed my impulse to leave the theatre as this wasn't worth my time and it shouldn't anybody else's. Bottom line: this is the worst SW movie so far and anything but promising for Disney's future with this franchise.",1,9,11,30 April 2018
Platoon," Transformations
","This movie might leave the viewer unsatisfied. No heroes, no happy end, no winning, even the humorous scenes are disturbing. Instead, this movie shows the main character's, a man of privilege, education and conscience, transformation by war and military service. War, an extraordinary circumstance, can bring out the best or worst in men, transform them according to their disposition and also change the warring nations en suite. All this and more is incorporated here, underlined by a marvelous score, convincingly acted in almost every role, scarring to watch, thought provoking and honest. On the downside, there are some minor continuity errors, lack in realism and typical Oliver Stone-esque transcendental scenes, though non of these infringe on any of the premises of this film unless you are a stickler for every last detail. This is deservedly amongst the best films about the U.S. Vietnam war ever made.",9,1,2,30 April 2018
