Ali," Go ahead waste your time.
","This movie oh what's the word I'm looking for, oh yeah...sucked. It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Honestly I can't think of a worse movie. It contained all gimmicks that make movies terrible-music that takes the place of story continuation, love scenes that couldn't even tug at the heart of someone recently struck by Cupid's arrow, a story line that wants to be a plot when it grows up, worst of all it was about three hours long. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the acting, but you could assimilate the best actors in the world and cast them in a 'Barney the Dinosaur Movie,' and what would you get? Well, my guess is it would receive more Oscar nominations than 'Ali.' Sorry Will-but I would rather watch every episode of 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire,' than five minutes of Ali. Well maybe the credits.",1,9,18,29 December 2001
