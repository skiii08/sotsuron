Mission: Impossible III," MI1 meets MI2.
","Some spectacular stunts, a villain with a laconic cool and a great comic relief in Simon Pegg. Not too intelligent but not insultingly mindless either.Some franchises get worse as they go on. Others get better. Rarely do they get worse, then pick themselves up by the scruff of the neck and combine the best parts of its predecessors to create a great installment. MI3 is a rare occurrence.Not as smart or character driven as MI1. Not as stupid or spectacular as MI2. It's a good compromise between the two.MI3 is an improvement on MI2, keeping the blockbuster status but making it smarter and more...well, realistic. In a totally impossible sense.",7,0,0,20 June 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Finally! My generations Indiana Jones.
","Yes, yes, yes! A gorgeous swashbuckling rouge, pirates, monsters, a damsel not so much in distress and a monkey. How could anyone resist it? One of the most entertaining films i've ever watched. It's smart, funny, engaging, exciting and it's fun! One of the rare films where you are actually taken on adventure.You admire and love Jack, you feel sympathy for the villains. You want to be a part of this world. It somehow manages to touch the child looking for adventure in everyone. A film you can watch again and again and again...Capt. Jack Sparrow takes a podium on the eternal hall of fame for heroes and his adventures I imagine will endure as long as Indy's.Bring me that horizon!",9,3,7,20 June 2006
Alien vs. Predator," A hell of a lot better than I expected.
","I refused to watch this when it came out. I thought it was a terrible, terrible idea, 'The Scorpion King' of the Alien franchise. I was wrong.I've never seen the Predator films but I love Alien, Aliens, don't mind Alien 3 and detest Alien Resurrection.Back is the feminist theme, a keystone of the franchise that disappeared in Resurrection. The Predators are cool, as are the Aliens vs. Predator fights. It looks cool - the design, the fx, the weapons, the aliens, the predators, the sets.It's a fairly cool film. More in line with Aliens than any of the other Alien films. Only one real creepy moment, the rest is hack and slash action but certainly a worthy addition to the Alien franchise, their best attempt since Aliens. Not too intelligent but not plain out dumb, its enjoyable and easy to watch.",7,4,23,20 June 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Should have waited for Brian Singer...
","Imagine it like this. You leave your home in the hands of a friend while you're away on holiday. You come back, the kitchen has burnt down, the pets are dead and what used to be upstairs is now a makeshift Gazebo in your front lawn.Ratner did not have the investment of Singer or the fans in this film and he did not treat it with the respect it deserved.He dropped an immensely well acted and favoured character from the series.He took Joss Whedon's premise and did it himself, never a good start - Alien Resurrection anyone? The plot is mangled and nonsensical.He then took liberties and leaps with the characters he had no right to. So drastic that it is now almost impossible for anyone to reassemble the pre-X3 franchise in any sensible way.He didn't understand the relationships between the characters and didn't try to. These are not the characters that we left in X2. The effects are cool, there are some neat moments but there is none of the emotional resonance or connection with the characters the other films had. He sacrificed what could have been great for the sake of a poorly done 'shock' moment and some cool effects that will age quickly.Watch, if only to see and learn why sometimes it is best to wait for a genius than hire a stand in.",6,1,2,7 November 2006
