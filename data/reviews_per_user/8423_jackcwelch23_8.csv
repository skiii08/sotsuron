It," A relentlessly creepy and unsettling ride.
","While it could have used more subtlety in the scare moments, the movie delivers surprising and effectively bizarre set pieces to keep you engaged. The likable and endearing losers group make the film worth watching again long after the fright has worn off. It manages to go from terrifying to hilarious, with Richie smashing it as the comedian of the group. It also touches on deeper themes of the bonds of friendship, the traumas that take our innocence away and the courage we need to face our fears. You won't only be scared, you'll be moved and inspired. Though your opinions on clowns might take a hit.",9,9,17,17 September 2017
Green Room," A straightforward, technically brilliant and intense violent showdown
","Jeremy Saulnier kicks it up 10 gears from his minimalist revenge film Blue Ruin to offer a confidently paced, well written and strongly acted piece of stylised violence. Anton Yelchin is excellent in his unfortunate swan song, with Imogen poots playing the shotgun wielding heroine who joins him in facing off against ruthless neo Nazis. Patrick Stewart is just plain creepy as Darcy, while Macon Blair also does a great job as Gabe the henchman. I have watched this film about 6 times with different friends and family as I find it endlessly watchable, as it is gorgeously shot, with a great soundtrack, gut busting violence and a real bad ass vibe, while like his previous works doesn't glorify revenge or conflict and shows that it really is humanity's dumbest solution to our problems. Violence is messy, unpredictable and despairing, much like our characters unfortunate situation. And some of my favourite movies cinematography wise have been shot with ARRI's so those guys know how to make beautiful images. Jeremy Saulnier well done you made a visceral and entertaining piece of work, the best revenge movie I have seen.",9,3,7,31 August 2017
Dead Poets Society," Sporadically inspiring but flawed and lacks true depth
","This movie has a lot of things going for it. Beautifully filmed in a picturesque location, with excellent performances by Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard. Having not seen this for years, however, some irritating flaws have made themselves known I never noticed before, such as how little Ethan Hawke is actually in it, and how underdeveloped his character is. More time seems to be given to Josh Charles seemingly pointless subplot involving him pursuing a pretty girl. Considering neither have anything interesting to say to each each other except cookie cutter love dialogue, it sort of undermined the more grandiose attempts that Robin Williams was trying to get at. Sure love makes life worth living, but portraying a love story that bland and shallow doesn't really inspire. Would have been better to have some more interactions between Todd and Keating in place of that so their relationship would be given time to grow, we learn more about them, making the conclusion hit as hard as it should. It also would have been nice for the actual meetings themselves to have more of a point and dissect and examine the poems they speak rather than getting them out of the way so they can dance and sing the night away. The intentions and the themes are good, plus the great score and the atmosphere are why this gets a 7, but in a perfect world it would have been a 10 if not for it's frustrating stumbles in the character and plot department.",7,1,1,30 August 2017
Predator," An exhilarating action movie that has stood the test of time
","Still retains the impact it had when it came out in 1987. Also does the service of reminding us how rubbish the sequels are in comparison. With it's expertly filmed action scenes, excellent score by Alan Silvestri and the iconic and high tech look of the title character, this is still a sci-fi action classic. Needs to be watched on a big screen with great speakers.",8,2,3,30 August 2017
Notting Hill," A Rom com that works because it's actually romantic and runny
","The simplicity and the earnestness make up for the occasional finger in mouth moments. Richard Curtis just likes it light, but the film stands up above other love movies because it has genuine heart rather than manufactured sap. You just feel the difference while watching. Gets high marks for making Anna Scott an indecisive and confused person trying her best rather than a perfect manic pixie dream girl. This is also Hugh Grant's best performance, while many would rather say about a boy I think he just gets every beat and moment right here, we just like him from the get go because he's just some bloke who wants love, with obstacles both big and small getting in the way. It manages to make us care about these two, which was the only goal it really needed to accomplish. It also supplies us with really likable and witty supporting characters who make the film even funnier than it needs to be, although Notting Hill isn't as whimsical a neighbourhood as portrayed here it's a charming name so why not set it there? Escapism what this movie gives us, and i was more than happy to spend 2 hours with Will and Anna.",8,0,0,30 August 2017
The Disaster Artist," A funny, sincere and heartfelt story of chasing your dreams.
","Having been lucky enough to get tickets to the Australian premiere of The Disaster Artist with Greg Sestero himself in attendance, I was excited and eager to watch this amazing story. A comprehensive look at the making of what might be the most perplexing piece of cinema ever. I was not disappointed. James Franco is so spot on in his portrayal of Tommy's quirks and character its actually surreal. His first scene having him enter an acting class with the confidence of a rockstar but the talent of a fingerless piano player. Almost all of his endearingly strange lines had the audience laughing their heads off. I tip my hat to him and hopefully the Oscars come calling. He deserves to be nominated. That presents a problem as well. He makes Tommy too likeable. While he was humanised to a certain extent and some solid insight was given into his motivations and feelings, it has to be acknowledged the real Tommy was far more obnoxious, manipulative and plain nasty. It was hard to present an accurate portrait of him as James Franco focuses more on his quirks and his charm and his tyrannical side was a bit glossed over. Nonetheless I gave him a pass and still loved watching him. And hey, you can't say Tommy isn't sincere. Other changes were made to the story and some plot points fictionalised, but that's the case in nearly every adaptation so that was to be expected. It did capture the spirit of the story and was never boring or slow paced, though it wouldn't have hurt to be a little longer either. Dave Franco does an excellent job as Greg, playing him a little more naive and optimistic than his real life counterpart (the real Greg knew he was not making a good movie, while this Greg seems a little more deluded.) but like the real Greg was so likeable and warm you just wanted him to succeed. The film's supporting characters are perfectly cast as well, with Seth Rogen playing a straight man role as Sandy the stunned script supervisor along with several comedians and famous actors popping up left right and centre. The making of the movie is the most enjoyable part and is seriously funny. One of the biggest laughs in the cinema was Josh Hutcherson's first appearance as the room's most peculiar character, Denny, goofy haircut and shirt intact. It was also great to see that Ari Graynor and Jacki Weaver, playing Juliette Danielle's Lisa and Carolyn Minnott's Claudette from the movie respectively, are portrayed as strong willed and thick skinned people who nobly put up with some of the worst working conditions for an actor imaginable. No water or air conditioning combined with gratuitous belly button sex would have probably broken others but they soldiered on.Overall it's a hilarious and genuinely moving account of an insane true story. It softens the darker edges a bit too much and I would have loved it to have included some even crazier parts of the book that didn't make the cut but what we're left with is still an excellent and enjoyable movie.

Final Destination," Effectively scary and unnerving
","I remember seeing this film for the first time when I was 6 years old. I saw it at our holiday house in Byron Bay and only 3 movies have ever terrified me as much as this one did (Jeepers Creepers and A Nightmare On Elm Street) but the idea of this movie is still so great whenever I think about it. Instead of a blade wielding psycho we have death itself as our villain. And hey, it can take any of us out whenever it wants. It cannot be stopped. Unlike the Terminator, some plastic explosive will not do the trick. If you're chosen, your time is up mate. I couldn't sleep for about 3 weeks after watching it. I still don't know how i can get on a plane without having a nervous breakdown. I also look on this movie fondly as it gave me a serious adrenaline rush of fear. It is more thought provoking than people give it credit too. We are only here on borrowed time after all. The big man in the sky will send the reaper to come calling for us someday. Maybe we should just be grateful we didn't end up on this particular death list, as I would like to die with my body parts intact at the very least. Another great thing about it is Devon Sawa's performance, believable and sympathetic. He brings credibility to a role that could have been cardboard. It is a great shame that his career never took off after this, but he can at least smile knowing he gave a memorable performance in at least one movie. It's still no masterpiece and it has an unsatisfying ending, and of course all the sequels sucked, but it will always send that shiver down my spine in the most satisfying way whenever I watch it.

Life," Beautiful looking but no different then the movies it copies
","Apart from its admittedly interesting and unexpected ending, there is little here you haven't seen before. A movie attempting to recapture the same thrills and chills that we have already been given in movies such as Alien, Predator and The Thing has a lot of work to do. It needs to hit as hard and have as much visceral and gut impact but sadly, this does not reach that bar. Gets into the nasty things jumping on people part too quickly, with great actors playing uninteresting characters, though Jake Gyllenhaal is mildly intriguing but not explored enough. The high production value and great score also makes it so much more disappointing that it doesn't strike the memorable chord. It's 2 thirds of a good movie, with the missing third being the pacing and genuine suspense. Thankfully isn't the queasy shaky cam of Daniel Espinosa's last movie Safe House, this goes the traditional route hold the camera in place and cut cut cut. Too bad I couldn't cut to the good parts in the theatre, there was a lot of dead space in between them.",6,2,4,29 August 2017
