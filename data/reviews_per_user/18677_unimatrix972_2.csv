Blade Runner 2049," Go watch the first movie before seeing this
","Sadly, I did not follow that guideline, and since it was like 20 years since I've seen the first one, this movie ended up being a narrative with many holes and unclear concepts. So it can't really stand on its own.In spite being more drama than action-packed, and having a pretty good story, some scenes just didn't add up. The characters' actions seemed to be random and significantly more complicated, instead of doing something more plausible.But, the major impact on my score was the sound and music. While I do remember the pleasant melodies of Vangelis in the first one, here the music was mostly irritating. I don't know if it was the IMAX effect or originally it was written there, but some music pieces were probably performed by a quartet of Tripods from Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds.Same goes to the sound of engines and vehicles, too loud, and used too often instead of making it outstanding and peak of a special scene.I'll now watch the first and then see the 2nd when it is out on DVD or something. If I feel that the score was unjust, I'll change it. Except for the music and sound, that's credit where credit is due.",4,16,36,5 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A pretty bad movie
","Maybe I had too many expectations, I dunno. Maybe I thought that after giving us the Dark Knight trilogy which in overall was good, and after Man of Steel which I really liked, that the combination of both could result in something satisfactory.On the plus side, Ben Affleck did a very good Bruce Wayne, I kept seeing in him my favorite Bruce Wayne from the 90s Cartoon Series. I would also award this movie with an extra 1 point on the scenes shown in the first 10 min - you don't often see this in a superhero movie, and that was well-crafted.The rest of it was disappointing. Whoever cut the scenes created gaps which made little sense even with suspension of disbelief. I remember gazing at the armrest to put my cola down, and when I looked back I couldn't figure how what I saw now is connected to what I see now. For a moment, I thought 'did I just fall asleep and missed like 10 min?'The characters were bad without the capacity of even simple logic. Interactions that could have been epic had the most lame dialogs. Information was 'free for all' and you were often left with the notion of 'how did he/she/it know?'Seriously DC, go over to Marvel and learn how to create an epic movie to build up the excitement of multiple superheroes.",6,2,5,26 March 2016
