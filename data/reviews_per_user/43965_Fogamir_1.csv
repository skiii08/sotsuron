Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If this had been the first Star Wars film, there wouldn't have been any sequels.
","Episode 1 is entirely too dependent upon knowledge from the book series, which most people have not read. In addition, a movie should be able to stand on it's own, regardless of prequels or sequels. The Empire Strikes Back came the closest to Episode 1 in dependency upon other movies, but still stood on its own. As one of those who waited anxiously for the 'most anticipated movie in the history of movies' I was severely disappointed. I only hope Y2K is as big a flop.",5,0,1,24 May 1999
