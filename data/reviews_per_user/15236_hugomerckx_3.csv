Captain Phillips," One of Hanks' best performances yet, great movie.
","I watched this movie because Tom Hanks was in it, so it already had to be at least okay. Oh boy. This movie went beyond all my expectations. Truly one of the best, most exciting and thrilling movies I have ever seen in my life.When I read the description, I thought the movie was going to be pretty slow paced and I thought it was going to have an exciting and suspenseful ending, but nothing more.
This movie took of on minute 10 or so, from there until the ending... non-stop suspenseful, thrilling, well acted and directed scenes with a great cast. To think that some of Somalis had never done a movie before... unbelievable. Imagine: it's your first ever part in a movie, it already stars Tom Hanks, in my opinion one of the greatest actors of all time, and you have to be intimidating and scaring him all movie long.
There wasn't a single moment in this movie where I got bored.Also, let me just talk about that ending scene. So Spoilers from here.
The moment they shoot everyone in the boat, and Captain Phillips is hanging there blindfolded, and you hear nothing but the Captain, who doesn't know what happened... I thought: 'okay, wow, so that was the most intense part piece of movie I have seen in a long time'. Then they get him of the boat and take him to safety... The doctors start to examine him, and try to talk to him... Boy, the moment he breaks... I got tears in my eyes. And that doesn't happen to often. The way Tom Hanks acted made it look so real, so gripping. He should have won an oscar for that scene alone.So that's my review. A thrilling, gripping, exciting, well acted masterpiece. Truly something else this.",10,0,0,2 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It was really good
","People will give this film bad reviews without even watching it. It is just popular to hate on star wars films now.
I personally loved it.
It is fast paced, thrilling and exciting form beginning till end. This movie will put a big fat smile on your face if you love the franchise.My advice, go watch it, then make up your mind and write a review. Don't just give it 1 star without watching it, that doesn't help anyone.",9,44,118,19 December 2019
Joker," Astonishing
","Where to start...I had high expectations for this one, it was even better than I anticipated.
When I first heard they were going to make an origin story for the Joker, I was sceptical. But boy, did they deliver. This film is instantly in my top 5 favorite films, it might be my very favorite, close with Shawshank Redemption.Joaquin Phoenix is truly wonderful, and he really deserves an oscar for this one.
My prediction is, it wins the oscars for Best actor, Best directing, Best adapted screenplay, and will be nominated for Cinematography and for Best score.If you are even a little interested in watching this film, do it. You will not regret it.This film will go down as a classic.Well done to everyone who worked on it.",10,2,4,4 October 2019
