The Sound of Music," A Classic Masterpiece
","The Sound of Music is one of the best movies of all time.  Great music, great performances, spectacular scenery (The scenery is reason enough to watch this movie). They don't make them like this anymore. Highly recommended for the whole family.",9,1,7,30 November 2002
Batman Returns," Worse Than I Remembered
","I bought this movie on DVD recently and this is the first time I have viewed it since originally seeing it in the theater.  All I can say is it is much worse than I remembered.  Once again as in the original Batman movie, the villains are the star and not Batman.  We get no new character development of Batman, no look into his motivations, psyche or past.  The character of the Penguin is bad enough, but the origin of Catwoman is absolutely absurd. Let's see if you are pushed out of a window and fall to what surely would be your death and then a mob of cats gathers around you, you will wake up a world class gymnast, an expert at martial arts and a master with a whip. You can also survive being shot 3 or 4 times at point blank range and survive and electric shock strong enough to fry someone else, heck if you get all this, push me out the window right now!  Save your money and your time and avoid this turkey and the following installments of the series, because it only gets worse.  One tip to Warner Brothers, whom I still assume own the rights to Batman.  How about a Batman movie, about Batman",5,2,4,27 November 2002
The Terminator," One Of The Best Sci-Fi Films Ever.
","The Terminator is one of the best Science Fiction films ever made. Although the plot is somewhat simplistic, the non-stop action and excellent performances more than make up for the thin plot.  One of Arnold's best performances (due to the lack of dialogue). Highly recommended for Sci-Fi fans. My rating 8.8 on a scale of 10.",9,0,2,3 October 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," One of The Top Ten Overrated Movies Of All Time
","Silence Of The Lambs is an average movie that has been hyped to classic status. The superb performance by Anthony Hopkins is the only saving grace of this film.  Jodie Foster is terrible as usual, she has to be one of the worst actress of our time.  The biggest problem with the film is the absurd premise that a FBI student (She is not an agent) would be left alone to handle an investigation of this magnitude. Sorry but that just isn't going to happen.  This movie is worth one viewing for Hopkins performance and that's it.  It shouldn't even rate in the top 500 movies of all time.  5.4 on a scale of 10.",6,1,8,2 October 2003
Ben-Hur," Spectacular!!
","Well they certainly don't make movies like this anymore(unfortunately) Great performances all around.  Great Action sequences and a moving story all add up to a classic. There are a few slow parts and it may be a bit too long, but you know its a great movie when you have to nitpick to find something wrong. Why can't hollywood produce movies like this anymore? Instead we get pure trash, 98% of what comes out of hollywood today is junk.  Do yourself a favor and check this film out, I highly recommend it.",10,5,7,28 February 2003
Jurassic Park," A Very Good Movie, That Could Have Been Even Better!
","Jurassic Park is a very good movie, but it could have been even better. Very Good performances, amazing special effects and a decent plot.  So how do I think this movie could have been better, First I believe the addition of the grandchildren characters hurts rather than helps the film, but the real let down for me is the ending.  For the T-Rex to save the day at the end is absolutely ridiculous.  The T-Rex shows up at just the right time how convenient, why would it even be there or enter the building? Where was the opening for it to get in?  Why would it attack the raptors instead of the people? Why would the second raptor attack the T-Rex instead of fleeing? All very unlikely and really brings the whole movie down a notch for me.  It would have been much better ending if the Game Warden had survived and came in and blasted the raptors.  I'm sure Spielberg just wanted to give us one more scene with the T-rex but it would have been better to have it either chase the vehicle as they are driving the to the heli-pad or actually try and grab the helicopter.  With that all said, it is still a very good movie which I highly recommened.",8,1,2,12 December 2002
The Godfather," Decent movie, but greatly overrated
","I just recently viewed the Godfather and while I find it an enjoyable movie, there is no way it deserves the #1 rank in the top 250 movies of all time. The plot is not that involved and the movie is a bit to long and drags in several scenes.  I found myself wondering when it was going to end and that is not the sign of a great movie.",7,3,8,10 March 2002
