Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great romp - but don't expect the revolution of Episode IV to happen all over again.
","In 1977 the world sat and watched something truly revolutionary - a simple tale of good guys and bad guys, knights and squires, aerial and naval battles, and a damsel in distress (a princess no less) but in a Science-Fiction setting.  The effects redefined what was possible, and what could be done, it's production was inventive and it struck a chord with the populace, thus was born the greatest motion picture phenomenon ever.This is now the fourth movie (or the first) some 22 years later, effects are still stunning - and still the best ever seen, but the same old plot devices are growing a little tired.  It's a fantastic romp - you'll enjoy every minute of the film - although it does get a little tedious around the Tatooine bits.Several movies have been borrowed from - the pod race is lifted straight from Ben Hur, the closing scene is lifted directly from Star Wars: A New Hope.It's great fun but don't expect the revolution of A New Hope all over again.",8,0,0,24 June 1999
U-571," Cliched and unrealistic representation of a great original sea story.
","I must admit I liked the film as I was watching it, but looking back later, its very cliched. The XO passed over because of a lack of leadership, the Captain who just manages to push the XO through the personal development door, plus quite a few other co-incidences of the highest order.Plus it's was also unrealistic and unrepresentative. The original version had a British Corvette, not an American Submarine pull off the mission. Torpedos of that era were point and shoot weapons. The idea submarines would use them against submarines is like two people trying to shoot each other with pistols at fifty meters with blindfolds on. Any of those near misses with depth charges would have sunk a real submarine. While Condor reconnaissance aircraft could travel long distances they certainly couldn't be used to escort a german Destroyer alone in the Atlantic. And there were no Destoyers in the Atlantic, the german surface navy was impotently confined to local waters or the Meditterenean for the duration of the war, their escape routes effectively blocked by the geography of Scandinavian/Danish water and the Royal Navy, and by the narrow confines of the Gibralter Strait to the south. And submarines certainly didn't have radar in 1942.Those annoyances beside, if you can suspend disbelief, then the sound quality is excellent and it looks good and it dramatic enough.Otherwise, stay at home and rent 'Das Boot'.",6,0,2,24 April 2000
Braveheart," A Western in kilts. A beautifully shot epic, of the likes the world had not seen for some years.
","A well, acted and well paced movie, such that you don't notice its near 3 hour length.  The real strength, though, is its visual imagery.  The blood and gore of the battlefield, the glorious Scottish highlands, the medievel castles and villages.Gibson thoroughly desrved the Oscar for best director, the imagery and camera work is stunning.  While the direction itself is not innovative it is far more than merely effective.  The battles are well depicted, using thousands of extras.  A personal highlight is the depiction of the battle of Stirling as for the first time in living memory cavalry is defeated by infantry.The dialogue feels great to listen to, and the plot is cohesive and flows well.  While the movie could quite easily down without the Princess sub-plot - it does add to the feel of the movie.Mel Gibson takes the lead role with a fire that was absent in some of his other historical work, for me the pick of the acting is Angus McFadyen as Robert the Bruce, the young would be king torn between yearning to follow William Wallace into the teeth of hell, and the brutul common sense of his ailing father.  A young man yearning to be a warrior while being forced to become a politician.  Also veteran British actor Patrick McGoohan is a joy to watch as King Edward the Longshanks.  A character to love to hate.While filmed as an epic not all epics live up to the tag.  This movie is an epic in every way.",10,7,11,3 December 1998
