The Blair Witch Project," Great Concept and Execution. Truly Creepy.
","This has to be one of the most original movies of the decade. Very creepy, with great dialogue and camera work. While this movie will not scare you out of your seat, it will make you restless on your next trip to the woods. The interaction between the characters is great. It really seems as if this is a home movie. Nothing seems contrived. To really enjoy the movie, you must get into the characters and their situation. Nothing jumps out of the shadows with a knife and a mask, so their fright is all in their minds, or is it. You are left guessing, even after the movie. This gets my highest possible recommendation.",9,1,1,7 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Much better than Expected
","I expected this to just be an hour and a half of cartoon vulgarity. But not only is this movie very funny, it is an excellent satire on the media frenzy blaming TV on the increase in youth violence. I highly recommend this movie to not only fans of the TV show, but also to those people fed up with parents and politicians passing the blame to tv and hollywood instead of themselves.",8,0,0,7 July 1999
Patton," Great Movie...A Must See
","I saw that George C. Scott passed away a couple of days ago. If you have not seen this movie, he gives one of the greatest performances in film history. The opening scene alone is worth the price of the rental. I recently heard that the coach of the Colorado Buffaloes played this scene for his players before a game to motivate them.The movie chronicles Patton through his landing in Africa through the final European victory. The movie is essentially a documentary, but it movies quickly and is never boring. Patton is such an interesting character. he refutes authority and believes that he has lived many lives as a warrior throughout the past 2000 years. In my opinion, it is not only the best war movie of all time, but one of the 10 best movies from any category. There is also a great performance from Karl Maldon as General Omar Bradley.",Null,2,5,24 September 1999
