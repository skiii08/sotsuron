The Ring," This movie is amazing!
","Well i voted a 10/10 for this film. It's absolutely great. I've got everyone in my class at school to watch it an we are all obsessed with it. We first saw it at my friends birthday party and i didn't find it scary at all, but i think thats because i've seen it so many times now. I have it on DVD, the special edition, with lots of special features etc. It was really good, it starts off with a really good beginning, and ends with a great ending, it keeps you in suspense and it is made really well. It's very good and it has a great story line, i couldn't wait to see the second one when i knew they were making one. I have now seen all the Japanise films of 'The Ring' but i still think that the American one is much better. If they ever make 'The Ring 0' I will definitely bee the first to watch it. I is my favourite film and if you asked me for advise, i would tell you exactly what i have said here. I hope you found this comment helpful! :D",10,0,1,11 June 2005
