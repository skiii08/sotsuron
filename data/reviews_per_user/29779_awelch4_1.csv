The Hangover," A stupid drugged male movie
","I didn't like this movie which wasted my time. It was like a 90 minute beer commercial featuring dumb male football fans. The plot is preposterous and non-funny. The characters are jerks. One unhappily married guy keeps lying to his wife. One guy is knocked cold by Mike Tyson. The group doesn't know where they've been and run around in a stolen police car, pay ransom to an Asian gang, etc. Plot, silly. Acting poor. Not an inspiration for young people. Irrisponsible. A good film requires either romance, adventure, conflict, mystery or comical talent. None of these ingredients will be found here. Don't bother with this one. In order to meet the required ten lines I'll add another review. Requiring ten lines of comment without making this a spoiler id idiotic thinking and I'll probably never use this movie site again.",1,7,15,6 February 2010
