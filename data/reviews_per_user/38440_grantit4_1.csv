Blade Runner 2049," Stands Alone as a breathtaking thill ride
","Along side the original, the two are completely different movies. And yet, this masterpiece still retains a that familiar unique feeling from the first, but goes WAAAAY beyond what was expected from fans...
Visually and Audibly stunning...
Story is gripping...
Acting superb...
10 stars is right on.
By far my favorite movie in the past 5 years at least.
