The Blair Witch Project," This is the future.
","While many deride this film as empty, or less than entertaining, the fact remains, like it or not: This is the future of filmmaking. Period.If you hate or loathe this film, all I can say is: do it yourself, do better. Like it or not, the makers of BWP have pointed the way. Anyone with access to a digital camera, computer and a simple editing program has the capacity to make a film.This particular piece, so roundly trashed by many, does have its own, odd, quirky points, moments that stand out and are now part of the horror iconography. While the detractors moan and groan, a simple tale from my own experience explains why I love this odd little thing.One of my supervisors overheard me enthusing about BWP. He chided me, as I am sure so many others will, about how 'bad' the film was, how 'stupid' and simply not scary. He went on in detail, and I responded simply 'to each their own,' or some such. A few seconds afterwards, though, he pulled me aside and asked:'It wasn't ... REAL... was it?'See, one of the greatest things about BWP is its simplicity.
Once upon a time, two boys and a girl went into the dark forest, and were never heard from again. The stuff whispered around campfires, or cautionary tales told by grandmothers to correct the unruly child... the power is in the simplicity.Would that Hollywood could see the point... but I fear they are blinded to it... I have hope, though, because, as mentioned above, this is the future, I have the technology, and I can do it myself, should I so choose... I would invite anyone that hates this film to see if they can do better, not so much as a throw down challenge, but rather as a simple desire to see what others can do with such limited resources.",10,2,3,28 August 2003
Sucker Punch," I had ridiculously high expectations for this...
","...And Zack Snyder delivered the goods over and over and over the top. He is now (having not seen the Owls film) IMHO in a small collection of directors as Masters Of The OTT: Terry Gilliam, Baz Lehrman, Ken Russell... and now, Zack Snyder.This film has been sniffed at and derided by the critics, a collective shrug of Meh... and it is wholly undeserved.This is Zack Snyder's The Matrix Inception at Moulin Rouge, as stylish a musical as anything else out there, but filtered through the creative mind that has lived the era of MTv meaning music videos that were short musicals and sometimes (all of my favorites, anyway) short musical avant garde films.Wild, rollicking, slipping into and out of eras and aeons, seriously cool soundtrack, it is eye candy for people with functioning brains.",10,6,10,15 October 2011
Casablanca," About as flawless as film as any made...
","I am normally loathe to agree with anything written by Roger Ebert, but in this particular case I am 100% in agreement with him: this film gets better each time you sit through it.Flawless performances by a superb cast, from a cobbled together script that should not work, and yet it does. With each viewing, this film resonates deeper and deeper. Each character starts to show the signs of the strains that they are under, inflicted from without and within.",10,1,2,1 January 2004
Unbreakable," By, and for, fans of comix
","A first edition of a comic book, especially at this point in history, is often slow and ponderous. Character and situations are developed, and plots begin. This is called an origin story, and fans of comix understand that often the story needs a while to develop.Sadly, film fans aren't attentive to such things. They have become jaded thrill seekers who cannot sit through a film that actually has something to say, and says it in its own sweet time.This film has a lot going on in it, just in terms of the scripting, and especially in the development of the characters. (In fact, this is the only film I own on DVD where I disagreed with every single deleted scene. I felt that the scenes only added MORE to the story.)It is a rare film, for me, that makes me actually desire to see a sequel. Not only do I ache for a return to the story of David Dunn, I felt inspired to actually write out a quick treatment. Fans of Star Wars and the X files do that, I know, and I never understood that, until I watched this film.
M. Night Shyamalan has also made The Sixth Sense and Wide Awake, both of which I also suggest.",10,0,0,26 January 2002
Fight Club," I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
","This film is often misunderstood, and usually by people that feel that masculinity is not only something to be derided but, worse, forgiven, as if being male was some type of sin.While it does, indeed, spin off into odd and unusual places politically, it does make a powerful impact. (Pun intended.) Norton, Pitt, Bonham-Carter and yes, even Meat Loaf, are each giving in this film some of their collective best work. Even the make up deserves mention. Usually, one thinks of make up in terms of Planet of the Apes. Here, it is subtle. Varieties of bruised flesh cross the screen, simple, small scars underscore the film's point. (For fans: Ever notice how the bus driver's nose has been broken?) A very daring work, often maligned for it's speed and flash.",10,0,1,26 January 2002
Battleship Potemkin," Still powerful after all these years...
","Sheer brilliance from start to finish!Most silent films appear dated beyond any hope of current audience standards. This film does not.It is now documented that this fictional account of the overthrow of the Battleship Potemkin has images that were for years used in documentaries of the Russian revolution. One sitting tells why.Of particular importance is the infamous Odessa Steps sequence, as perfect an example of film editing as the Shower Scene from Psycho, the Hitchcock classic. (See the copy in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables.)",10,2,3,1 January 2004
Face_Off," What we have here is, failure to communicate
","Dear Mr. Woo,Please go home to Hong Kong and stop making these lame excuses for films here in the United States.Even a film like A Better Tomorrow, not one of my favorites, is far superior to the work you've done here. Is it the stars you use? Or is it the studios and studio hacks?I love Hard Boiled, and The Killer, and A Better Tomorrow, 2.
Face/off is okay...I have seen more far fetched films...I just can't recall when.  This could have been so good, maybe just ask  Mr Travolta if he is in Good John mode, or Battlefield Earth mode?",5,0,1,24 March 2001
2012," A sburg movie
","Roger Ebert likes to coin movie terminology, as he is OH so clever, so here is mine: Sburg.Sh!t Blowed Up Real Good.Yes. Incorrect grammar is required here. This is a film where things blew up, over and again. Repeat.Cusack apparently needed the paycheck (no problem there: John needs the work), and Oliver Platt shows once again why certain actors are always worth seeing. Danny Glover hasn't had a decent role in a really long time, and getting the chance to be Morgan Freeman in Deep Impact would have been interesting, but here he is a milquetoast Peter Sellers' Merkin Muffley (he deserves better). Amanda Peet was ... well, she's Amanda Peet, and after that I really don't care.Bottom line: plot line? Sburg. Character development? Sburg. Deeper understanding of the human experience? Sburg. Cinematic genius? Sburg.Sburg, sburg, sburg, sburg and then sburg.Hey, I don't get on a roller-coaster to contemplate the mysteries of the universe, I get on for the ride, throw my hands in the air and give off a whooping sound. This would be the film equivalent of that. While I hate to see some of my favorite actors in roles that just aren't good enough for their obvious talents, wtf, wotthehell, you buy the ticket and take the ride.",8,0,1,30 November 2009
Moulin Rouge!," 21st Century musical, style with substance
","A film that is as packed with wild visual imagery as this one is usually accused of being devoid of meaning. In this case, the images assist the meaning.There is a feeling of being young in a new world, full of thousands of new sensory experience. When the hero realises that he is indeed in love, the film slows down, his new universe reduced to the two hearts beating in unison. As in many love stories, hearts are broken, and we are drawn in, closer and closer. This film is about people, their faces filling the screen. The camera lingers on the countenance of each of the players. Eyes predominate, letting us glimpse into the souls of these people.Hypnotic, mesmerizing and seductive, this work is worthy of, if not requiring, multiple viewings.",10,0,2,18 June 2001
WALLÂ·E," Superb in every way... but ....
","The thing here is something that I am not seeing on any other comments (yet, okay, I haven't read them all yet)... but does anyone recall Honey, I Shrunk The Kid? Fair enough film, good fun for the kiddies and the folks weren't insulted, but ... the reason we flocked to it was the oddity of something the parents remembered, but the kiddies had never seen before: an opening cartoon.The short animated bits before Pixar's films are as good as, if not better than, the films they precede. While the opening short (Presto, as I recall) is not better than Wall-E, it is one of the funniest shorts I have seen since Duck Amok.Seriously. When it was over, I looked to my wife and said 'Thank God it was short. If it was any longer, I'd probably have done myself an injury.' Wall-E is another Pixar masterpiece. Sad, funny, touching, and even sometimes disturbing, it tells a tale with nearly no dialog. It is also a brutal assault on the state of things in terms of the environment, personal responsibility... it is the kind of film that parents need to watch carefully, as there are hours of conversations that one can start with the little ones.",10,1,4,28 June 2008
The Sixth Sense," Superior film making by a superior film maker
","Something that seems to pass unnoticed by all of our so-called Critics, is that M. Night Shyamalan makes remarkably subtle films. This is, ostensibly, a horror film. There is a very restrained sense of violence and gore, although both are present. No one seems to notice that people in all three of his films *whisper* their lines... no one shouts in this Night. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)There is always a sense of place in his films. We see a world that is not Hollywood, nor New York. This is a place he has been, and knows intimately. A rare and wonderful thing in itself. The film's pace is deliberate, a Shyamalan hallmark. He lets the story tell itself, at its own pace and in its own style. Rare and wonderful are terms that come to mind, over and again, with each of his films.",8,0,0,26 January 2002
Kagemusha," Is there a more beautiful film than this?
","Stunning in its visual beauty, there are moments in this film so perfectly realized that when I FIRST saw it, I had to stop my machine, back up the tape and watch them again!The story itself is superb, a common thief is a perfect double for a warrior king, saved from the gallows to act as a stand in to confuse enemy troops. The dual role of thief/warrior king shows exactly how an actor's mind works, in creating two completely different and separate characters.",10,1,4,1 January 2004
V for Vendetta," This is not a film for everyone...
","For those folks that hated 'Fight Club' and whose reasoning was that it was just about guys beating each other up, for those who disdain 'Watership Down' because it was about rabbits, those who sneer at 'The Little Prince' because it is a children's book... those folks will hate this movie, and they will tell you that it is about a crazy person that blows things up.A unique film experience in that it is possessed of much flash and boom and sturm und drang, it remains literate, and very much true to its source. So much so, that my estimation of Alan Moore has dropped as he insisted his name be removed from this film. Your loss, Mr. Moore.While the windmills Mr. Moore was tilting at have proved to be just shadows on the political landscape, forbearing that which is as things are, the story, and the impact, remain.",10,4,9,19 March 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Is there room for whimsy in the 21st Century?
","1st: A disclaimer: If the title credits show the names Joel and Ethan Coen, it is a 10 in my book. The only exception would be Crimewave, which is almost a 10  simply due to it's Marx Brothers level of insanity and over the top silliness.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is so sublime, so perfect... a minuet in a world of heavy metal, a meraingue in a universe of soft serve.The film is seamless, and yet certain images remain: the ghostly Baptists approaching the river; the 3 weird sisters; each and every scene with Goodman; and my favorite, the burning cross that falls onto the KKK... reason enough to see the film, IMHO.The music on the soundtrack is must-hear.  The characters are given up as simple, and exactly as good as they should be and no more, nor any less.",10,0,0,24 March 2001
