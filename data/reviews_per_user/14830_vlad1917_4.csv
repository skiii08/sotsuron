The Blair Witch Project," utter horror
","i saw this movie as a focus group in april...and i still haven't recovered. scariest movie of all time. hands down. i dont even like scary movies cause their never scary. i've seen cannibal holocaust, i've seen exorcist...those PALE.",10,1,2,22 July 1999
A Clockwork Orange," i was cured all right
","the problem people have with this movie is their either looking for a glorification of violence, or an apology for one. this film delivers neither.some of the scenes in this movie are far more violent than any action-packed rambo movie, but only two people die throughout the film...it's the intensity of the violence that makes people say 'ick.'the intensity and the awkward ambiguity...alex is the definitive anti-hero - should we root for him or not? this dialectic confusion is common in kubrick's works: killer's kiss, eyes wide shut, fear and desire...and a clockwork orange.i for one am very glad kubrick left out the 21st chapter, which was a cop-out and distorts the meaning of the book...this is it's pure form.",10,0,0,30 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," YOWZA!!!
","this movie has the best surprise ending since we found out who kayser soze was...i had no idea. someone's gonna ruin it by posting here. there's only a few real scary shockers in the movie, but they had us almost jumping out of our seats...they dont overplay or explain the background of the dead people either, so it's nice to see a NON-CORNY horror movie for once.",10,0,0,23 August 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," brilliant!
","i can't think of a funnier movie...and one of the few movies i can tolerate to see more than twice. unforgettable (and ever-quotable) gags: 'blue, no...ahhh!' and 'it's only a model' and 'i told em we already got one!' and 'run away!!' and the list goes on...and one of the most brilliant, unexpected endings in film history! a better ending than The Usual Suspects and 6th Sense! Kayser Soze has nothing on John Cleese!",10,0,0,27 August 1999
