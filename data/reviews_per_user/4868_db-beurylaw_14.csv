First Man," If a movie is this dark it's unwatchable
","The movie is boring, boring boring. But I found all of actions scenes to be so dark that you cannot see what was going on. On several occasions the screen was totally black. I was shocked to see cinematographer Sandman was nominated for an Oscar and several other awards. The film makers evidently thought that a dark screen was mysterious and interesting. It was not. Just awful.
I remember Jimmy Carter wanted John Glenn as his running mate, until he discovered how boring he was. He made Walter Mondale look exciting. The lesson of this is that astronauts are brave and resourceful but boring. Apparently Neil Armstrong was boring. The film makers captured this perfectly.",2,1,4,21 July 2019
The Longest Yard," 200 NFL players should line up and kick Sandler in the nuts
","This movie should be called a tribute to the absolute wonderfulness of Adam Sandler, by Adam Sandler. Sandler plays a pro football player who behaves like a jerk and goes to prison. There he forms a football team and they play a revenge game against the guards. That's pretty much it.This movie is a remake of a much better movie starring Burt Reynolds. Reynolds could carry it off because he was in fact a college player. Nobody, no matter how stupid believes for a minute that Sandler could make a high school team. When an actor makes a movie like this and is cast as a macho he-man, even though he is clearly a wimpy girlie man, they should permit the real NFL players, all of them to kick the pretending actor in the balls. Even the kickers. Especially the kickers. This is Sandler's second offense, he did the same crap in Waterboy.The only time a movie should be re-made is when the original, and every print, DVD, VHS, Beta and laser disk was destroyed in the same fire and civilization would crumble without this artistic achievement. This is not at all true, the original was a decent popcorn movie, this is crap.Sandler reminds of the ego of Jerry Lewis minus the talent. Every movie he has been in would have been better if some other actor, any other actor played the Sandler part. Since the only reason to re-make this movie was so Sandler could once again massage his ego and play a macho football player, all of the prints, DVDs should be destroyed.For all of you people who gave this crap a high score, I hope your tastes in movies improve by your tenth birthday.",1,1,2,6 January 2013
Fury," Attack of the Nazi Zombies, oh brother
","There should be a second rating for truth and accuracy. I read an article in the New York Times that praised this movie for being very accurate. The Times got it wrong and the film makers got it very, very wrong. Why is it so hard to make an accurate movie about World War II? Many of the participants are still alive and they are always very offended with filmmakers present nonsense, like this movie. First of all the film makers chose to have this story take place in April of 1945, then they ignore the situation as it stood at that time. The war in Europe ended on May 7, 1945. The fact is that the five man crew of this tank had to know that the war was almost over as they were fighting deep in Germany. At that time the Allies (US, Britain, USSR et.al.) had more than twice as many soldiers and way more equipment than the Germans. Most of the German army was trying to get to the West to surrender to the Americans because they knew that they would be treated better than being captured by the Russians. In April alone 2.3 million German soldiers surrendered. To watch this movie one would believe that the Germans outnumbered the Allies and outrageous acts of valor were required. In fact, the allies were aware of the mass surrenders and trying to minimize their casualties. It is true that the US Department of war gave the armies inferior tanks. They chose to manufacture Sherman tanks which had far less armor and artillery. It was chosen because it was cheap and could be manufactured in greater numbers and the allies had far more of these tanks. But the German tanks were better, that much is true. As a result the Allies attacked in mass formations. Not one loan tank. This brings us to the final climatic scene. The five man tank crew are all alone in a broken down tank. There is battalion of about 250 Germans coming they're way. Pitt decides to stay there and battle the 250 Germans alone. In a broken down tank. In the last month of the war. His heroic (stupidity) attracts all four of his comrades who agree to a pointless fight to the death. The terrible part is that the Germans mindlessly walk into the Tank's line of fire as if they were Zombies. Maybe they were left over extras from Pitt's last movie World War Z. Maybe Hitler was so desperate for soldiers he enlisted the very old, the very young and even the recently undead. Anyway, even though the Germans co-operated in being slaughtered by the Americans they eventually overwhelm them. But there is more: in the closing scene we see scores of dead Germans surrounding the disabled tank. Notice that none of the dead Germans fell on the rough road. They all managed to die on the soft grass. I thought for a moment that the newly arrived troops moved the bodies off of the road, but they would have laid them in rows. This was not the case. The Germans were lying about as they had fallen. Just not on that rough, dirty road!",2,10,18,7 April 2015
Captain Marvel," The Mysoginsists are out in force in these reviews. Brie Larson was awesome.
","So many terrible reviews from the public. The movie is as good or better than the movies with a male as the protagonists. The nerds don't like women as the center of attention. I saw the same thing two years ago with Wonder Woman. The nerds liked everything about Wonder Woman, except for the woman. Here several amateurs go out of their way to praise Samuel L. Jackson and the cat. It's there way of putting a strong female lead in her place. You'er not even as good as the cat.
I saw the same thing with Wonder Woman. A strong woman repells weak minded men. They write that Gal Gadot was terrible, flat can't act. I'm reading the same thing written ( by nerds) about Brie Larson, even though she's won every major acting award while still in her 20s. I'm sure these nerds voted for Trump while even aware he is a idiot, conman who's every business failed.
Read their reviews about Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman. They're not against women, mind you, just those women, or any other that gets the part. Now read comparable amateur reviews of movies with a male lead. Nobody is viciously attacking Robert Downey. It's an action adventure based on a comic book. As such it was a good movie. Brie Larson carried the film.",8,2,11,31 March 2019
This Is the End," If you like latent homosexuality, vulgar language and this turds for you
","I hated this movie. As Roger Ebert once said, Hated it, hated it hated it. I expected to hate it, it was supposed to be like Pineapple Express, which is a terrible movie. I was stuck waiting for a Megabus and had 3 hours to kill and happened to be right in front of a movie theater. I thought the theater experience would show my what all the stoners are raving about. It didn't help. What surprised me is the latent homosexuality. All six of the actors play themselves and they are all hot for each other. The previews feature Emma Watson. Ms Watson is in the movie for about one minute before they run her off. Then its just 6 men with their hilarious bantor of their desire for each other, creative ways of using the word 'fuck' in every sentence and how they are lusting for drugs. It reminded me of a horrible fraternity party I once went to where none of the women showed up. The boys got drunk and screamed about how they should such each others dicks. The movie starts off with Seth Rogan and Jay Baruchel playing themselves. Rogan wants to go to James Franco's house. Baruchel is whining that Rogan wont pay attention to him there and he doesn't want to share him with Franco. Really! Once they get there, Franco has two large paintings, he created, one with Rogan's name and the other Franco's. Could it get more gay? Baruchel then pulls Rogan away cause he can't go get a pack of cigerettes himself. (Acting like teenage girls) While there, apparently Aramgedden begins. They go back to Franco's house where six men are holed trying to figure out how to divvy up the drugs and one Milky Way.If there was something funny here, I didn't see it. My old fraternity brothers were way funnier. What is disconcerting about this comedy and several other comedies of late is that they have all male casts. (Tropic Thunder, Hangover movies, The Interns, etc.) It all frat boy all the time. But as a former frat boy, I can tell you that we weren't latent homosexuals. Is Hollywood trying to send us a subliminal message? Gotta say that I am a liberal who totally supports gay rights (marriage, employment, all civil rights). I don't dislike gays, I just don't want that to be the theme of every movie. I notice that another comedy this summer is 'The Heat' which is just women (Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy). Is the Taliban supervising how movies are made? Its either all men or all women. The sexes don't mingle. No movie should be all male or all female unless its about a submarine or prison. As someone said on Twitter, 'This is the End is close to gay porn.",1,28,80,15 June 2013
World War Z," Zombies! and they want to be taken seriously
","I heard this was a good flick and I like Brad Pitt, so I didn't learn much a bout it when I went in. As I sat there, I was shocked that it was about zombies, and it wasn't tongue in cheek. Remember Zombieland? Yeah, it was about Zombies, but you knew it wasn't to be taken seriously. Especially when they shot Bill Murray who was playing himself. World War Z is silly, stupid and not worth your time. The tone is that the world is being taken over by Zomnbies and only Brad Pitt alone can save it. Zombies are like unicorns, or Teddy bears with lasers, you can't do it with a totally straight face. This movie tries and falls flat on its face. The first scene of the Zombie attack lets you know that you are in for a silly ride. Pitt and his wife and children are caught in a tight traffic jam when the zombies attack. Suddenly all of the cars pull over to the side so that Pitt can drive. It was just like the scene in 'Bruce Almighty' when Jim Carey (as God) causes all of the cars to pull to the side. Only that was a farce. Here the cars pull over to the side because the Director wanted to put in a car chase scene. Like oh yeah, the middle of being eaten alive by Zombies everyone pulls over to let Brad Pitt pass. Then after Pitt wrecks his car, he gathers up his family and puts them into a conveniently available RV. Again thousands of people are being attacked but only Brad is smart enough to get into the RV. Then they drive away across a bridge that is jammed with cars, but the cars have cleared a path for the RV. The word on the emergency Broadcast system is to stay away from big cities. What does Brad do? He takes his family out of Philadelphia and drives them to Newark. My understanding is that Newark isn't safe even when it is not over-run with Zombies. The dumbness just goes on. The movie was directed by Marc Foster who I remember directed Quantum of Solace, you know the James Bond film where there were such extreme close ups you had no idea what was going on. Same thing here. Lots of scenes where the camera was so close, you had no idea what was happening. Mr. Foster should not be directing anything. Beware of movies that have only one recognizable star. The drama is a star interacting with other stars. Here you had Brad. So there was no drama or character development or anything of interest, except a few very exciting action scenes. Which did not make any sense.",3,11,23,23 June 2013
Argo," 6 was a 10, until I researched the facts
","There should be a ratings system (another one!) for movies 'Based on a True Story.' There would be one rating 'T' for true story one that supplements a History education with a true depiction of historical events. A second rating with be 'SL' this movie is based on real events by Some Liberties have been taken for dramatic effect. And finally 'TBS' although this movie does relate to real historical events, it is Totally Bullshit.Argo is sorta based on real events, but as it goes along, it gets more and more like a comic book version of what happened in Tehran in 1980. Six Americans escaped the takeover of the American Embassy and were able to hide in the Canadian Ambassador's house after they were hid by the British and with help from the New Zealanders. If you believe this movie the British turned the American's away. Ouch turning on our best friends in the world!If you believe this crap, you believe that one brave American outsmarted the Iranians and rescued these six Americans. The facts were that it was a very brave Canadian Ambassador who stuck his neck out and orchestrated the escape.This embarrasses me as an American. Americans have accomplished a lot and have shown extraordinary bravery. But that does not mean that every heroic act has to be falsified that it was done by an American. Movies like this and The Great Escape and U-571 are a slap in the face to other nations and belittle us as taking credit for other countries heroism. (In the Great Escape, Americans and British dug tunnels to escape from a POW camp, IN real life the Americans were transferred out before the big breakout and the Brits escaped. In the movie it was the Americans who escaped including a motorcycle riding Steve McQueen who hurdles the barbed wire on his bike.) In U-571 some American Sailors enter a sinking German Submarine to grab a German code breaking machine, Very heroic, except that the sailors were British.If you are an American you should be embarrassed by this kind of stuff. If another country, say Italy made a 'true' movie of how they landed on the Moon, wouldn't you think its a joke? That's this movie.On top of that, the socko ending never happened. The Ben Affleck character (who was part Mexican in real life) did not take them to the Bizarre, they did not have their tickets cancelled, they did not have a problem with security, and there was no chase down the runway. IN fact they went to the airport at 5 in the morning and caught a plane and flew away. If you're gonna make a movie based on true events, tell us up front that what you're presenting is a total pack of lies. Embarrassing.",4,9,14,23 February 2013
Knocked Up," extreme right wing propaganda film
","I am shocked at all of the hidden messages. This movie should have been shown at the Republican convention. First message is that pretty white girls are taken advantage of by illegal aliens. The producers make it subtle by have the Seth Rogan character be a Canadian, but why make it a point at all. Note that the illegal alien is an unemployed pot smoker, who has no job and spends his day watching porn. Oh and he lives off of a recovery from a personal injury settlement. Suck up to the Insurance industry. So Rogan meets up with a squeaky clean American girl and gets her drunk and has sex. Of course in Conservative world, sex must always be punished in this case by the girl getting pregnant. And even though she has the 'dream job' of being on television interviewing 'celebrities' like Ryan Seacrest, she wouldn't dream of an abortion. Instead in the right nutjob world, being forced to become a parent forces the illegal alien, unemployed, porn watching slacker to become a responsible citizen. We all know if we outlawed abortion, it would make every lowlife into super dad/successful citizen. What a bunch of crap.Other than that, the movie was rarely funny, just a message to white suburbia that their values are the right ones",2,12,22,25 December 2012
Interstellar," If this is how humanity is to be saved, we are doomed
","This is stupid. Stupid, stupid stupid!!! And boring. I want to congratulate reviewer melkurion and incorporate his or her well written review. I wish he or she had written the script. If you like stupid movies that make no sense, I suggest you get a copy of 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea' another amazing insult to your intelligence. At least 'Voyage' was fun to watch for the mere stupidity. This one is simply extremely boring. The first 45 minutes is Mathew McConaughey as a single father talking to his daughter? You can go to any park on Saturday afternoon and see the single fathers talking to their kids and it will be far more entertaining. Then Cooper (McConaughey) stumbles into a super-secret NASA installation, not in Florida mind you, but apparently in a corn field in Iowa. He is immediately snapped up to pilot the last remaining space ship on a dying planet. He has to save the earth from a dust storm. The angst is that he has to leave his daughter and it might be a few hundred years before he gets back. Here's the reason I write: NASA is sending its last space ship, its only hope to save our species, with a pilot they just met, two other guys and one woman. Huh? If you're going out to find another habitable planet, and chances are the people sent are never coming back, and you send one woman? The writers do know where babies come from, don't they? Anne Hathaway plays 'Brand' and is the only woman on board. What if she gets killed? What if she is infertile or not very good at getting pregnant? The entire future of the human race is riding on her. She is 32 years old and looks older. They would have been better off leaving Cooper at home and sending his daughter. Any reasonable effort to save the human race would have been to send three young women, one viral young man and a whole lot of frozen sperm. The reason that there is just Hathaway is because of the movie convention that we must always have more dudes. Always. Even if the situation calls for women, even if it only makes sense that the participants be female, there must be mostly men. And director here fell back on the cliché from SI-Fi movies of the 50s: Why is there a chick in the space ship at all? Because she is the daughter of the Professor who is masterminding the project. If the professor didn't have a daughter, they would be all dudes in the space ship. Brand couldn't be accomplished on her own? She gets to be in the space ship because she's the daughter. The science may have come a long way from the 50s, but the male dominated film industry has not. As I said the whole movie made no sense and is an insult to your intelligence. Add in the chauvinism and you got a fun night out.",2,8,17,15 November 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Why am I the only one that gets this movie?
","This movie is not about mental illness!Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a man that is madly in love with his wife. When he comes home from work he finds her in the shower with another man. He goes ballistic and severely beats up the other man. Since you cannot legally beat up your wife's lover, criminal charges were filed. As part of that proceeding Pat is forced to be institutionalized and therapy thereafter.He is pursued by Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who's husband recently died. She is clearly looking for companionship by sleeping with all of her co-workers as a way of obtaining human contact. In our society when a woman chooses to have a lot of sex, we decide that she has a mental problem, there's even a name for it. These two people are not mentally ill, they are both suffering from a broken heart. Pat has a panic attack when he hears his wedding song being played. This is not crazy but part of his withdrawal from the woman he loves.I feel sorry for the woman who wrote a review and said that her son suffers from bi-polar disorder. She is correct that Pat and Tiffany are not behaving like crazy people. They are having withdrawal symptoms from past relationships.When they come together as a couple at the end, you know that true love is not a cure for mental illness. But as a cure for a broken heart it does just dandy.",10,3,12,6 January 2013
Les Misérables," fantastic . . .mais pouquoi?
","One of the best movies I ever saw. I always read through the reviews of people who loved or hated it and was surprised how off base the haters are. They generally hat two things: the close ups when the stars are singing and the fact that some of the singing is less than perfect. Both are choises made by the Director Hooper.I thought the close ups added to the power and emotion of the performances. this is, after all, an over powering tragedy. Every character suffers unjust incarceration, extreme poverty, degradation, the killing of all their friends, etc. I felt the close-ups laid the emotions raw and was extremely effective.Other reviewers, both professional and users, faulted various performers' singing as being less than perfect. This was a unique decision of Hooper to have the performers actually sing on the set, instead of pre-recording the songs in a studio and then lip-sync on the set. Most reviewers were in favor of the lip syncing. Really? You prefer the fake over the real? I grew up in Las Vegas and saw most of the great singers of our time live. There is no way I would have preferred to watch Streisand or Sinatra lip sync. A few sour notes is a small price to pay for the realism of the performance.It appears that some reviewers are looking for some flaw, any flaw as a way to discredit a masterpiece. From beginning to end it was a wonderful experience. I saw the play three times and each time I went home and the experience stuck with me. The same thing with this movie. My only real criticism is when Jean Valjen rescues Marias and drags him through the sewers he is covered in pooh. A whole lot of pooh. Just his eyes were poking out through the pooh. Did we need that much pooh? We got the idea, it was a filthy sewer and he was willing to do anything. And then he encounters Javier (Russell Crowe) who is resplendent in a period uniform. I just wanted Valjean to throw a handful of pooh on him.My other question is where were the French actors? The whole story is about French patriots dying for France. It all takes place in France and every single character is French. The main actors Crowe and Hugh Jackman are from Australia and New Zealand. The actresses, Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried are from New York City and Pennsylvania. The rest of the entire cast is British. I'd be willing to bet that not one of the extras in what appears to be 20,000 extras in finale was French. Heck in the Dark Knight Rises, one of the main characters was French, even when that made no sense. The 2012 Oscar winner for best actor is French and is famous for being a singer, but not a single part was found for a French performer. It was like re-making West Side Story without a single Latino, Porgy and Bess without a single African American or Music Man without a single American. Here we had performers sing how they were willing to die for France, but they were not willing to cast one. And only one word in the entire film was uttered in the French language and that was 'Bonjour'. Very odd.But of course, none of this really detracted from an emotional and satisfying film experience.",10,2,3,30 December 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," So vile, why wasn't this rated X? Excuse me NC17?
","This entire movie reminds me of Michael Douglas's character 'Dfens' in 'Falling Down', the scene where he is stunned to ask 'I'm the bad guy?' This is a very political movie, so by definition, this has to be a very political review. I initially gave this film a 3, because there were some productions values and it was thought provoking, but upon reflection, it is thought provoking in a negative way. As you know Islamic extremists have launched a number of attacks on Western civilians. In response, the government created a 'war on terror' to find and murder the people responsible. The Bush Adminisration was ineffective probably because it worked to their benefit and allowed them to pursue 2 wars and destroy American's civil liberties. But there was no discussion of that. There was no discussion of why the Islamists are attacking the west. Is it because of our economic polices that were hurting them? Was it because of their religious beliefs? This movie does not even attempt to address these issues or many others. There are extreme depictions of torture, but no comment on the fact that torture does not work. In fact, in this investigation, all of the torture (and there was a lot of it) produced very little good information.What we have is a pro-government, rah-rah movie. If it wasn't pro-government, it would have been rated NC-17, largely banned. Two people making love can't be seen, but torturing a Muslim, well take the kiddies. The problem is the final result was it shows our government as being the 'bad guys'. Just because the Islamists are evil, does that mean that its OK for us to be evil? Again, the movie does not care about that ethical issue. All that matters is that 'we' win. Rah!I only went to see it because of the hype. Oscars? Eww, that would diminish the Oscars, as well as our nation. On top of that it wasn't even a good movie. I came out of Les Miserable uplifted, Zero Dark 30, made me depressed and disgusted. Yes fighting terrorists is nasty business, but we should at least acknowledge that we have sunk so low as a result of their tactics. There was no mention of that.",6,15,34,10 February 2013
12 Years a Slave," A little too black and white and red all over
","Making a movie about a Hollocaust is a surefire way to have your movie labeled a classic. Be it about the destruction of the native American nations and theft of their land, the murder of the European Jews or the enslavement of millions of Africans movies about how awful things can be real award winners. The gravity of the evil injustice is enough to catapult a mediocre script and production into an award winning epic. Even if the movie is not very good.The plot of this film is that slavery is bad. No really, its really bad. We have to tell you that it was bad. Very bad. Awful, in fact! This film reminds me of another stinker, called 'The Boost'. In that movie the lesson was that drugs are bad. Really bad. Incredibly bad. In case you missed it, drugs are not good. By the first 20 minutes I got it. Slavery was no fun at all.Here's the plot: Solomon Northrop (Chietel Ejiofor) is a free black man living an idyllic life in 1841 New York. He is gullible as heck and agrees to go with 2 slavers to Washington where slavery is legal. It never occurs to him that even free black men should watch themselves in slave country. After being plied with liquor, he wakes up in chains. He then has to work and get beaten for 12 years. Boy I didn't know slavery was bad until this movie. (sarcasim) There really is no plot just a lot of beatings.What I found interesting was that white people in New York were delighted to meet black people. They were welcome into stores and parties and taken on trips. White people in the south were uniformly evil. They would beat a black person nearly to death just for getting a bar of soap. (Except for Brad Pitt, but he was the Producer.) They didn't really work their plantations so much as use them as platforms for the torture.I give it a 3, It was an effort to show a horrible institution that can never be forgotten. But I didn't think it was all good versus all evil. I don't believe 1840s New Yorkers behave like white delegated to the Democratic Convention, nor do I believe that all Southerners were 100% vicious all the time. Yes Slavery was bad. I got it.",3,25,45,16 February 2014
Pineapple Express," Boy does this movie suck!
","First of movies matter, the values depicted in movies matter. There has to be some sort of standard of what is right and what is wrong. Its OK to have the protagonist have morals that deviate from the norm, and of course we all respect Robin Hood and his mantra that he 'steals from the rich . . .' But here the protagonists witness a murder and because they need some cash decide to sell some drugs down at the school yard. We have a movie absolutely devoid of any morals whatsoever. This movies is just a step, a baby step above child pornography. We expected to approve of their decision to sell drugs to kids! I don't have kids, but I was still appalled.Secondly our protagonists, a bunch of drug using slacker losers, end up in a gun battle with the bad guys that is worthy of Rambo. Are they losers or commandos? One of the rules of comedy is that the protagonists are underdogs, the 98 pound weakling who eventually figures out a cleaver way to succeed. But here the protagonists are simply trigger happy goons. And they sell drugs to kids. This movie should be buried at sea.",1,4,13,23 February 2013
