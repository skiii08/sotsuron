Casablanca," Cinema at its finest
","Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane,Brief Encounter and Rebel Without a Cause. All of these films are classics,but I don't think any of them can topple the legacy and transcendent beauty of the masterpiece that is Casablanca.
The terrific script works unbelievably well with Humphrey Bogart's character Rick, as he moves through life with cynicism and sarcasm. 'I don't stick my neck out for everybody'sums up the Rick we meet in the first quarter of the film.He is courteous to his customers,but for a mysterious reason he is only really concerned about himself and doesn't seem worried about others.Then,our queries are answered.Ingrid Bergman arrives,and it is then we understand the true reason behind Rick's underlying sadness and cynicism.As the film progresses,the audience experiences some of the best on screen chemistry ever seen;Bergman and Bogart are incredible together,in the few scenes they share,their emotions and love for each other is reflected extraordinary by the actors. The fantastic script merges in with their characters so well,as they toy and wonder where their love will take them. The supporting cast of Paul Henreid,Claude Rains and Peter Lorre provide terrific performances to shine with the two co-stars.Now,the ending. Most romance films often end with a conventional happy ending.Michael Curtiz and the Epsteins gave us so much more. As we hoped for Rick and Isla to reunite,Rick's sacrifice in the airport unfolded, and we realised that the ending is not so gloomy after. Rick's sacrifice of letting Isla go with Victor,was undeniably heartbreaking for Rick,yet his sacrifice to do the moral thing for the right cause internally left him redeemed and ultimately content that he did the right thing for his nation. The screenplay in this film is so magnificently woven together with the performances of the actors,iconic dialogue and soundtrack,that it firmly distinguishes itself as the greatest romance film that has graced our screens. It is simply the epitome of great cinema, a preeminent work that is perhaps the most phenomenal film to come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",9,1,2,7 February 2019
Pulp Fiction," Simply flawless
","In my humble opinion, Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films that have ever been made.The plot structure is a work of perfection,with the non linear aspect working incredibly.
The performances by John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis were superb; Samuel L Jackson's portrayal of Jules Winnifield was especially spectacular. The film produces an absolutely unique twist of dark comedy and violence,topped off with great pop culture references.Perhaps greatest of all,is the phenomenal dialogue; the witty dialogue and subtext will never be able to replicated in any other film.
This is Tarantinos masterpiece , a magnificent work of cinematic art that deserves to be heralded as one of the most iconic films of modern cinema. Pulp Fiction revolutionised cinema making for years to come, and rightly cements Quentin Tarantino's status as an exceptional director.",10,0,1,23 December 2018
12 Years a Slave," Brilliant yet disturbing
","Steve McQueen manages to create an unforgettable depiction of slavery in the 19th century with his latest work,12 Years A Slave.
The film's harrowing and emotional scenes makes for difficult viewing,however it is perhaps the first film to not shy away from portraying slavery in its pure,unadulterated form of atrocity and this is why the film is a unique,powerful experience.
Chiwetel Ejiofor delivers an utterly brilliant performance as the musician Solomon Northup,who was tricked into abduction, and consequently slavery.Ejiofor portrays the emotion and despondence of Northup to perfection,yet he always manages to maintain a sense of nobility,even though he is enduring an agnosising plight.In moments where he feels he cannot speak due to his position as a slave,Ejifor's uses his facial expressions to illustrate the anguish and pain of his ordeal,leaving an indelible effect on the audience of his sorrow and suffering.
Michael Fassbender gives a great performance as Edwynn Epps,the slaver of Northup.Fassbender embodies the character of Epps,and his internal struggle with sanity that drives him to barbarous cruelty and acts of random sadism, is portrayed by his pure malovence that leaves the audience terrified and disgusted.
Perhaps the most astonishing work by a actor/actress accomplished in this masterpiece is by Lupito Nyong'o. The young talent is the emotional core of the film;she displays the savagery of the slaves' ordeal with her anger and despair that rocks the audience to their core.
Furthermore,the cinematography achieved by Sean Bobbit is exquisite,creating a stark juxtaposition between the wondrous beauty of the natural world and the ugliness of humanity.
McQueen has produced a film that accurately depicts the history of enslavement,while creating a cinematic work of art that is greatly powerful and will leave a lasting effect on audiences for years to come.",9,0,1,3 January 2019
There Will Be Blood," Phenomenal acting by Daniel Day Lewis
","Daniel Day Lewis' performance was phenomenal, with Paul Dano giving a great performance as well. The plot could have been more engaging, however the film provides an unparalleled view on the themes of achieving the American dream,greed and religion",8,0,0,23 December 2018
Inception," A work of art
","The esteemed director,Christopher Nolan,has created an unforgettable work of cinematic art in the form of Inception.
The extraordinary creativity and complexity that Nolan has treasured this film with left an indelible,unwavering effect on me,and one I will not forget for a long time.
The ensemble cast is superb:Joseph Gordon-Levitt;Tom Hardy,Cillian Murphy,Marion Cotillard,Michael Caine,Ellen Page and most notably of all,Leonardo DiCaprio.Dicaprio manages to pull off the painful guilt and regret that his character (Cobb) endures with great effect,while gliding through dreams and reality with effortless,smooth ease. The cinematography achieved by Wally Pfister and Nolan is a visceral beauty;rotating rooms and cities folding on themselves are just some of the spectacles on show that leave the viewer awe-inspired.
As always,Hans Zimmer delivers a haunting yet beautifiul soundtrack in the film.
Perhaps greatest of all,is the phenomenal screenplay that Nolan has given to the world. There are very few films that have screenplays which can top a dream extractor tasked with the challenge of planting an idea of someone's mind,delving into several layers of dreams and exploring the subconscious. The sheer magnitude of Nolan's imagination and genius to produce Inception proves that he is undoubtedly one of the best working directors of the last 30 years.
Inception deservedly will cement its place as a masterpiece of cinema,and its vast power to push our minds to its boundaries and bend it in ways we as the viewer didn't know were possible,will stand out mightily from the many films of our world.",9,0,1,29 January 2019
