Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3
","First, a confession; I'm not a fan of the Marvel superhero universe in comics or films. There, I've said it! If anything, I would say that I'm more of a DC/Vertigo, Image and Dynamite Comics kinda guy really and still not much into the superhero side of things either, and so 'Iron Man 3' wasn't originally on my movie watchlist for 2013. Yes, I'd seen and enjoyed the first 'Iron Man', didn't bother with the second, and wasn't overly fussed about 'The Avengers', although did catch it on blu later, so I wasn't too bothered about watching Shane Black's take on 'Iron Man'. That was until I'd seen the trailers.For once, the trailers did their job on enticing me to want to see a film I had no plans to see, which makes a change! Hollywood suits knowing how to promote a movie? Whatever next! And as always, I try to stay clear of any clips and spoilers before going in, I like to watch a movie with knowing as little as possible beforehand - a difficult feat these days with a multitude of websites scrambling to get snippets of news and spoilers out.What I saw was a Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), suffering from an inferiority complex, after battling a God and aliens in his exploits in 'The Avengers', and coping with that by building new suits at the cost of his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as well as the rise of a new villain, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), to deal with. And after Stark seemingly losing everything that mattered to him in one go and being stranded, it's up to him to find himself again and to save the day!I watched it in dazzling 2D, and the film is a well rounded feature and is what you would maybe expect from Marvel these days. It zips along at a good pace, but I did feel it kind of sagged in the middle, which coincided with the annoying kid sidekick for me, after Stark is stranded in a small town. The film does pick up again towards the end though with the climactic confrontation and the suits all joining up to battle at the end, as seen in the trailers.Ben Kingsley's performance stole the show for me, totally not what I expected. And the rest of the cast played their parts well too, as you would expect. Especially RDJ portraying the fall of Stark from cocky braggart to finding his human side again, and an awesome Gwyneth Paltrow as the love of his life.As always, go in with an open mind, and if you enjoyed Marvel's Phase One superhero films and were one of those that squee'd yourself at 'The Avengers', then you'll definitely get a kick out of this movie and the first of the post Avengers Phase Two Marvel movies. Don't forget to stay after the end credits too!",7,0,1,10 May 2013
Gravity," Believe the hype!
","In the month between the US release and the UK release, there was a ton of hype about 'Gravity'. Some calling it THE cinematic experience of the year, some calling it the most stunning looking film, some saying it is Sandra Bullock's virtuoso performance, a must see movie! After seeing it for myself, I kind of have to agree on all points.We join veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and rookie Ryan Stone (Bullock) on a repair mission to the Hubble Telescope, until the debris from a destroyed satellite causes chaos and so begins the thrill ride that is 'Gravity'.And it is definitely a thrill ride of emotions, as we follow the two astronauts, with the focus on the rookie and how she copes with the frankly terrifying ordeal and her emotional journey of self-belief and survival. Throughout the 90 minutes, we're with her as she experiences the anxiety, the disorientation, the despair, the vulnerability, the danger, the hopelessness, the desperation, then the belief, hope, and relief! I was exhausted by the end! And I can positively say that I've not been as gripped throughout a movie as I have this one.The VFX work is simply stunning. Not overblown or in your face, but giving you that sense of realism as if you've been watching a NASA video. I thought that the musical score by Steven Price worked really well too and helped to expand the emotional feel of Stone's ordeal.Overall, 'Gravity' is well worth the hype that has been thrown at it. Tense, emotional and a superb performance from the focal star, what more do you need!",9,2,3,13 November 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," 'Star Trek Into Darkness'
","First up, I wouldn't say that I'm a huge Star Trek fan, probably more what you could call a casual fan (Did a bit of 'extra research' into the mythos to learn a bit more before I went down to the 'Destination Star Trek: London' convention last year), and I did enjoy JJ Abrams' first Trek film. And on that basis, was looking forward to his second installment.Well, it was a whole lot of fun! To borrow a tagline from another film, it was an 'epic of epic epicness!' A very entertaining entry into the world of Kirk, Spock and company. A blend of action, of which there was quite a lot, humour and a bit of emotion (especially, I felt, at the start with Noel Clarke that kick starts the events of the film).The banter between Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) and their clash of personalities is at the heart of the film, especially towards the end. Kirk does seem to have matured a bit since the last film, and Spock still plays by the rules, but they do play off each other very well. The rest of the cast have their moments in the sun as well, plus Dr Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) is a good addition to the cast as well. But it was Benedict Cumberbatch that stole the show for me. His character did remind of his excellent portrayal of Sherlock and in 'Into Darkness' he played a villain that was very manipulating and captivating when he was on screen. And to be honest, you wouldn't expect anything less from Cumberbatch!The soundtrack from Michael Giacchino is typically Giacchino too and is very bold and sweeps you along throughout the film. The piano led piece 'London Calling' starts very emotional and definitely helps set the scene it's in at the beginning of the film. Giacchino is fast becoming one of my favourite score composers.After watching this, it's definitely safe to conclude that JJ Abrams knows how to shoot an action film. The effects didn't seem to just be there for the sake of it and served a purpose. Although you might not say that about his tradmark lens flares, which were certainly present throughout (glad I was watching it in 3D and wearing those darker 3D specs!). With his next film being 'Star Wars Episode VII', I have no doubt that it'll be in safe hands, minus those lens flares hopefully.With a decent villain being the perfect foil to the characters that we know and love, and with a few nods towards the Star Trek of the original series, you've got a pretty damn good film, and you don't really need to be a fan of Star Trek to enjoy it, but it will help!",9,3,13,15 May 2013
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim
","SPOILER ALERT: I Loved this! This is what your big summer popcorn blockbusters should be all about!From the trailers you get the simple premise about this film, 'as a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and a trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.' Yes, it uses the familiar tropes from various movies ('Independence Day' immediately popped into my head when watching this), and, essentially, what you see is what you get, but don't let that diminish the feeling of fun when watching this film.I'm sure the so-called 'critics' that have shot down this film, have done so more on the basis of how could a director, that has made 'The Devil's Backbone' or 'Pan's Labyrinth', stoop so low to come up with a movie like this? But this is Guillermo del Toro, and from the vampires of 'Cronos', the ghost story of 'The Devil's Backbone' and to his twisted fairytale 'Pan's Labyrinth', his films come from his passions, and as a loveletter to the Kaiju and mecha films of Japan, 'Pacific Rim' is no different and deserves it's rightful place alongside his other films.But back to the film, and it really is a simple story, of good old heroism overcoming monstrous adversity and saving the day. The Kaiju and Jaegers are impressive and the fight scenes, although with not quite as much carnage and destruction as 'Man Of Steel', still hit the spot and are the definite highlights of the film. The characters are standard fare for this type of movie; the washed up hero back for redemption, the untested rookie, the stereotypical other pilots, the leader of the crew who used to be one of the pilots (along with the typical inspiring speech before the end), the arrogant pilot who goes up against the hero, the bickering scientists, it's all there and there to be enjoyed. I loved this film for exactly for what it is, a big dumb roller-coaster blockbuster of a movie, but oh, what a ride it was!",9,4,11,18 July 2013
Oblivion," 'Oblivion'
","I love my science fiction, and 'Oblivion' felt like a homage to my favourite genre, taking it's recognisable themes from the world of sci- fi. It was also a stunning looking film. From the design (the bubblecraft and drones for example) and the visuals (cinematography was by Claudio Miranda, who won Oscars for his work on 'Life Of Pi' and 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button') and the barren landscapes of a war torn Earth. If ever there was a gorgeous looking film, then this is it!I also enjoyed director Joseph Kosinski's first film, 'Tron: Legacy', and 'Oblivion' seems to continue his style of gorgeously shot films, and I certainly look forward to more from this director.The story itself, which is based on an unpublished graphic novel by Kosinski (an illustrated novel will hopefully be released), and without giving too much of things away, has Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), and his by-the-book assistant Vika (Andrea Riseborough) assigned to Earth, its surface devastated after decades of war with the alien Scavs, to repair the damaged drones that scan the planet surface. When Jack discovers a crashed spacecraft, it's contents bring into question everything he believed about the war, and may even put the fate of mankind in his hands. The trailers don't give too much away, for a change, and although towards the end it becomes a bit of a sci-fi mixtape with familiar tropes from some of my favourite sci-fi films, it's still a very enjoyable ride! The soundtrack by Anthony Gonzalez of M83 and Joseph Trapanese is one of the highlights of the film and very haunting. I've been listening to the score leading up to watching the movie, it's very good as a standalone piece and it does work especially well within the film. It did remind me at times of Daft Punk's score from 'Tron:Legacy' and 'Blade Runner' by Vangelis, which is no bad thing at all!If you go in expecting a full on action sci-fi with aliens etc, like the trailers may have presented then you may come out of the cinema disappointed. But, if you're after a bit of quality in the same vein as 'Moon' and love science fiction, like I do, then you will enjoy 'Oblivion'. I can't wait for the blu!",9,4,12,24 April 2013
Man of Steel," 'Man Of Steel'
","I've said before that I'm not too much of a fan of superhero films (Marvel in particular for some reason), but I did enjoy Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' trilogy and Zack Snyder's adaptation of 'Watchmen', so I was fairly looking forward to watching their collaboration on 'Man Of Steel', especially after watching that third trailer.It's the familiar origin of one of comic's most iconic characters, in which 'a young boy learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth. As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind.'I liked the way they told Kal-El/Clark's upbringing and certain other events with flashbacks. Yes, this film is essentially a rebooted origin story, and it is a quite familiar story even to non-fans, so there's no need to go into too much detail, but just enough to get a grounding on his early life in Smallville and until we meet him proper.The overall feel of the film I thought it was very sci-fi, much more so than any previous Superman film, what with the beginnings on Krypton and all the spacecraft etc. But I did enjoy that, and did separate itself from the previous films as a result.This is a Zack Snyder film after all, and that is very apparent from the effects and camera angles. For me it did work well, particularly the way Superman, Zod, Faora etc were jumping and speeding around on screen. Also the carnage! By 'eck is there a lot of carnage during the climactic battle. So much so, I don't think there is much of a Metropolis left to make the already green lit sequel. Whole buildings collapsing, rubble everywhere, it all reminded me of the 9-11 ground zero videos.I liked the ending with Clark and Lois at the end, had a smile on my face after that. Thought it was a good way to end it.There is also a 42 page prequel comic, (story by David S Goyer, Geoff Johns and Zack Snyder, script by Sterling Gates with art by Jerry Ordway) that is worth a read that is set a thousand years before the film and ties into events in 'Man Of Steel'.A modern update to a classic origin with all the thrills and action you can want, albeit with not much of a story, but just enough. The cast is really good in this and Henry Cavill IS Kal-El (Clark Kent only really appears at the end). If you're expecting a film in the same vein of 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, as most 'critics' probably were considering their low ratings, then you may be disappointed. But if you enjoyed 'Marvel's Avengers' and the other supers films from Marvel, then you'll certainly get a kick out of this!",8,0,2,21 June 2013
The Wolverine," The Wolverine
","This second stand alone Wolverine film is a lot better than the first, in my opinion, and with Marvel Studios going full pelt into their universe, what with the recent 'Iron Man 3', 'Avengers, and the upcoming 'Thor 2: The Dark World' and recently announced 'Avengers 2', Fox have had to up their game a bit with their 'X-Men' movies to compete with the similar properties, and it does show, if a little rough around the edges.The story is better too and tells of Logan's struggle with his immortality, as well as the love story between him and Mariko (Tao Okamoto). I did think that the villains in 'The Wolverine' were a bit meh, throwaway type villains if you will. Not really fleshed out enough, although that was maybe mainly due to the plot being about more of the suits behind corporations than say an evil force to subdue. That said, if you add in the few decent fight sequences; the funeral, on top of a speeding bullet train and of course the climactic fight at the end, plus the deep Japanese culture and lush scenery throughout, it's a decent enough effort into the X-Men mythos. Entertaining, but maybe not quite on par with the Marvel/Disney efforts, but almost there.And a word of warning, you've just GOT to stay after the end credits, as it seems to set up things to come. It's worth it, believe me!",7,0,3,31 July 2013
