Sucker Punch," Great if you're opened mined and don't expect Inception
","***May Contain Tiny Spoilers*** As a Zack Snyder, I was thrilled to see him release an original piece of work. I watched this movie opening day which I've never done before just to support him. So was my time wasted? The movie follows Babydoll, as she bands with four other girls in a plan to escape the mental asylum her evil step father sent her to. The girls have five days to see through their plan before Babydoll is lobotomized.Okay, this movie is no Inception but I can see why some may think of it when watching Sucker Punch. To escape her unfortunate reality Babydoll escapes into a dream world set up like a high class brothel which she uses dance to escape into other branches/levels of reality where the girls fight fantasy creatures in search of the five items they need to escape.Well this is a Zack Snyder movie, so if you will complain about anything in this movie it shouldn't be the graphics. Cgi is top form in Sucker Punch and is breathtakingly beautiful and full of detail. Other than the amazing cgi, and saturated colors, it wouldn't be a Zack Snyder movie without the epic slow-mo. I wouldn't say the movie had an abundance of unnecessary slow-mo but their were more than a few. I think the scenes were spread out well. In one particular scene towards the end, the slow mo kicks in full gear and what results is one of the most amazing special effects fight scene I have seen in awhile. All the fight scenes in general worked very well and look like effort was taken into making them. It is definitely a film highlight. One thing I really enjoyed about the movie was the soundtrack. The music choices fit perfectly with the setting and kept my head slightly nodding throughout. Some people might call these scenes too 'music video like,' but I think they worked well. The acting wasn't too shabby with stand out performances from Jena Malone aka Rocket and Oscar Issac aka Blue Jones.All in all. The movie had several twists and turns that will hit you like a 'Sucker Punch.' You won't expect some things. The movie actual has a pretty good message about stories and if you pay attention you should get it. This movie is not over complicated but a lot of people might not understand exactly whats going on. It is another good effort from Snyder but a movie that the majority probably wouldn't like which might hurt him. Overall, if your looking for an entertaining ride that makes you pay attention, and starring hot girls, this just might be your movie. If your expecting Inception or Kill Bill or whatever then this probably not you movie.8/10 from me.",8,92,183,25 March 2011
