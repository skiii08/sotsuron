Knives Out," Friends all say 'Knives Out' is very nice. go and have a look. '
","I glanced at the cast a little and decided to go. The name 'Knives Out' is too sharp. I didn't expect it to be a mystery movie or Agatha's 'country villa' detective novel model. However innovative it is, it cannot escape the framework of nine types of tricks that Edogawa Rampo has concluded",8,1,2,27 March 2020
Interstellar," This movie is mainly about the threat that human beings will not survive in the near future with the deterioration of the earth's natural environment.
","This movie is mainly about the threat that human beings will not survive in the near future with the deterioration of the earth's natural environment. At this time, scientists found a wormhole near Saturn in the solar system, through which they could break the limitation of human ability and search for the chance to continue life in further outer space. An expedition team crossed the solar system through the wormhole. Their goal is to find a planet suitable for human migration. On this ship called 'Endurance', the explorers are facing unprecedented challenges that human thought has never met. This ..This movie shows us that in the future life, science and technology are closely related to our life. In the boundless universe, there are still endless unknowns and mysteries waiting for us to explore and discover. For example, what kind of five-dimensional space, wormholes and so on, all of which are mysterious beings in the universe.
However, advanced technology is still needed to explore the basis of all this. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, we have already walked out of the era before and entered the era of advanced science and technology. The development of science and technology has brought great convenience to our life. We cannot do without science and technology. Science and technology are all around us. Any series of changes around us originate from science and technology. The benefits it brings us cannot be ignored, thanks to science and technology! It is the great power of science and technology that has changed our world and made our life better.
However, science and technology is also a double-edged sword. With the development of science and technology, we have indeed enjoyed many benefits of science and technology. However, the environment is deteriorating day by day and will eventually threaten our survival. Therefore, it is even more necessary for us to be cautious and handle it carefully. While developing science and technology, we should not neglect the nature on which human beings depend for survival, and let the environment and science and technology develop together!
Let's face up to the power of science and technology, cultivate a heart that loves science, nature and science from an early age, contribute to the development of science and technology, and make our life better!",8,0,0,15 May 2020

1917," probably the most beautiful war film in recent years
","Photography is beautiful, but can it not be meaningless to the end, the narrative rhythm that should have been due to 'no' editing, resulting in the length and span of space-time transformation are distorted, take two steps to change the world, scene switching seems unreal, the pattern is like a third-person war of independence game. But the cruelty of war is also reflected in the small pattern: the fallen heroes can also be scattered everywhere. Some of the literary plays are also old-fashioned and cheap, especially the Anglo-French friendship play. But the fire ruins are so beautiful, the burning church is like the end of 2049, and the drifting drama is amazing, probably the most beautiful war film in recent years.",4,1,2,20 March 2020

Pulp Fiction," Two pieces of dancing music
","I like this movie and this electric soundtrack. The two favorite songs are all related to dancing. First, the swing dance in the car bar is the soundtrack of one of the most famous passages in the movie history, 'jack rabbit slims twist contest', which shows the music alive with a twisted body and fierce guitar playing. Then there is the song girl,you'll be a woman soon, which Uma put home after winning the trophy.",8,1,2,31 March 2020

Jojo Rabbit," This film has a sense of standup comedy in its comedy effect.
","From the point of view of the audience, this film has the feeling of standup comedy in the comedy effect, and the whole audience will naturally be praised by the public. In addition, the film is very rare that although the plot is relatively weak, but there is no vulgar and similar to the Jews and Nazis through the exchange of understanding and good bloody plot. The boy's transformation is handled delicately, which is one of the rare highlights of the film. This is not the first comedy to make fun of Nazi and Hitler Youth, but it is a good one because it doesn't force people to laugh with a fart plot.",6,0,0,20 March 2020
Green Book," I like this setting very much.
","Tony is really a good husband. He feels embarrassed to write a letter and is unwilling to write because he cannot write well. But his wife asked him to promise and he said ok I promise. I began to think that he might only write one letter, but I didn't think he wrote all the way. Ha ha, it's really very warm. Seeing him scratching his head and making awkward sentences, he would write to his wife during the rest of the day and night. I like this setting very much.",9,0,0,1 April 2020
