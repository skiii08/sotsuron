Howl's Moving Castle," Really good movie
","Personally I have never liked much anime. In saying that this is one of the best films ever made. It's clever, quirky, humours at times, and all round enjoyable film. To top it off the dubbed version has Billy Crystal as the fireplace. What more could you want in an animated strange and at times confusing good movie?",9,0,0,14 March 2020
