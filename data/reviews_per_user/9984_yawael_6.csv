It," Much Better Then The Original
","When i first saw the adds to this film i thought that i saw it's name before, and then i realised that i saw it in a bookshop at the stephen king section, so i said to myself i had to watch it because of stephen's great works such as : Carrie, Misery and the Green Mile, and a lot of both great books and a successful film adaption.I really wanted from the beginning to watch this film, but since there was an earlier version i decided to watch it first in order to understand this one more to make a fair comparison between both of them and the result was like everybody who saw them which is that this version was much away better( but we can only compare it to the first part and we had to wait to the sequel to make the full comparison).Anyway the old one was very good at the first half, but in some points it goes down by flashback story (by repeating the flashback for every character it made it kind of boring not to mention the bad performance from the adult actors. but in this version we saw it in one story line without the flash back which was away better.Another thing that was great in this movie is the scary scene i really didn't saw these kind of brilliant shots for long time. As for the evil character i think that both Tim Curry and Bill Skarsg√•rd were at their best, but felt a little sad for Curry because his scene were so little comparing it to skarsgard.The final part of this compression was the kids which was better in the 90s version than this one ( i think this was the one thing that made me unable to put 10 out of 10 to this movie).don't get me wrong kids here were good,but not great as the old one i mean who could compete The performance of the late Jonathan Brandis, another thing was that there was a lack in the relation between the kids and their parent except only two characters and that confused me a lot because the time of the film wasn't short so they could developed a better one. Nevertheless this film is one of the best films of 2017 that no one should miss.",8,8,13,14 November 2017
"I, Tonya"," A Great Performances
","This film talks about the life of (Tonya Harding) one of the best female skating in the 90s. and her big scandal that destroyed her life career.The film stars one of world famous actress in our time Margot Robbie who raise to fame after her huge breakthrough in Wolf Of Wall Street 2013. following with two acclaimed movies ( Focus 2015 & suicide squad 2016) which distinguish her great star power.As for this film no doubt that MR delivers one of her best performance to the screen, she really transferred herself of becoming the real Tonya.
Allison Janney was really the second reason for watching this film, she really brought one of her best performances which's mixed with comedy and darkness (her role really is one of the best dark comedy performances I've ever seen).Despite these two stars the film could have been better, the main problem of this film was the interview scenes for each character, it wasn't bad , but it took a lot of time of the film which makes you losing the track of the film, not to mention becoming bored in a lot of times because the film was really long and maybe half of it was in the interview style and in a randomly way!
i think they could saved this problem by two things:
First: They had to reduce either the intreview scenes or the time of the filmSecond: they had to put the original interviews with the real people, because no matter how the actor is good, he will never be able to show the same view of the real person.At the end it's an okay film and a must watch for both MR & AJ performance.",6,5,9,26 February 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Brilliant
","Arguably this film is one of the best films of 2017 the story line was so powerful and unique at the same time, and the three leading actors ( Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson )
 brought one of their best performances till date.Frances McDormand character is fantastic she shows her toughness having this strong character to all the people 
around her, like she is saying ( i don't care about what do u think, i'll do what i want no matter what),
but when she is by herself or a closer friend who knows her very well she shows us her feeling as a broken heart women and she is still have feelings and big heart
and the director gave us that in an early scene when she helps an insect that is on her back unable to walk.Woody Harrelson also gave us one of his best heartbreaking roles that is different from most of the characters that he usually plays.But the biggest surprise for me was Sam Rockwell, he was superb at his role and he brought to the screen a complected character
in a funny way, so yes the character is racist and have this a dark side, but at the same time funny and enjoyable to watch.
he is the kind of guy who can't do anything without asking his mother first, but he is uncomfortable with that and it showes very well in the way of pronouncing her name while someone mentioning her
 and making fun of him.( i couldn't stop laughing when his mother asked him : Do u want me to go to the police station asking them to bring you back!!!)As for the whole film the directing is very good not brilliant, but again it's so decent ,
and the story is so good and enjoyable except the last part because they gave us so much at the begging and the middle of film, but at the end they closed it in an open ending style,
which i didn't like.Final rate:8 out of 10",8,7,14,1 March 2018
Predator," Makes Commando Look Like A Shakespeare Masterpiece !!!
","Sorry, but i still don't know why people keep considering this as a classic!1- it's just a show for Mr.Schwarzenegger body.2- Zero logic in this film3- Predator Can't kill Schwarzenegger As Other Actors, because he is the star of the film ( i guess Predator was afraid of losing his job)4- They killed at once two black actors ( as they couldn't wait to get rid of them)I really I don't mind popcorn films like commando, Tomb Raider,Justice League etc, but to make a cheap, boring popcorn Movie and promoting it as a classic that is the worst thing you can do in a film industry ( it reminds me of Friday The 13th, Twilight)
a film with nothing gained millions of Dollars without knowing why !sorry but this film deserve 3 out of 10",3,4,15,9 November 2018
The Evil Dead," Is It A Blood Or A Ketchup!!!
","I've always heard about how a great horror film this was and how it's still very great and powerful to it's day, and as i'm a huge fan of both classical & horror films i watched this one and after i finished it i just kept looking at the screen (because i was so surprised).I was really so surprised not because of it's quality, but because how bad it was. the story line was so weak, actors were so naive, not to mention how the scary shoots looked very silly, funny and so predictable at the same time.Now a lot of people will attack me by saying it's a classic movie, you can't compare it to today standards, and the answer is: look at horror movies from the same era such as : Friday the 13th, a nightmare on elm street, and Halloween and you will find the answer by yourself.from the first scene they started by unconvincing scary shot, which i found it so silly. then there were a lot of unreasonable shots : how come the only scary person of the whole group leave the house and goes through the forest without asking for help from her friends (it doesn't make a sense!!!) and then when she returns back to the house screaming like a drama queen and knocks at the door in a very effective way no one shows till the end! and how about the huge amount of blood that made the scenes looks so funny rather frightening ( and i asked myself while watching it : is it a blood or a ketchup!!!).Sorry, but i don't recommend this film to anybody, even to my enemies.final rate:2 out of 10",2,10,16,12 September 2017
When Harry Met Sally...," Still One Of The Best Romantic Comedies
","(When Harry Met Sally) discuss an important thing that many people are still arguing about it till this day: Men and Women can't be Friends. And for the rest of the film it discuss this issue and make it for sure that no man can ever be a friend to a woman due to the sex part between them.WHMS: is a brilliant comedy with brilliant direction and casting. Starring: Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, and directed by the fabulous Rob Reiner: most known for (Misery 1990 and Stand by me 1986).
Meg Ryan made a lot of comedies, but her best performance was in four films (including this one):
<ul><li>Sleepless In Seattle 1993</li><li>When Harry Met Sally 1989</li><li>Joe Versus the Volcano 1990</li><li>You Have Got A Mail 1998</li></ul>She was really amazing here with hair funny facial expressions and her acting is the same style she uses in SIS, so if you love that film I highly recommend this one.As For Billy Crystal he was funny as usual, he is one of my favorite comedian star of all time, and I don't think that anyone else could portrayed this role as he did, her really was fabulous.At the end the film is powerful convincing source that both men and women can't be friends no matter of what they pretend, someone may disagree with it saying that he or she has a lot of friends from the opposite sex, but the film here is not discussing the normal friendship (which includes dining at the end of the week, or going to a bar and have a drink) it talks about the best friend : so it is impossible to find a best friend female to a guy that goes wherever he goes talks about the smallest details that guys talks about (And the same thing goes for women).Final Rate:
