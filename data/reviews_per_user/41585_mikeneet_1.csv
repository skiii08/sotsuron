Casablanca," Casablanca review
","While speaking of bench mark films in the film industry, Casablanca is one of those films that pops up here and there. Its storyline, fantastic. Camera work was out of the ordinary, in a good way. As for lighting, things like the light only filling or touching half of ricks face could be a sign of what is to come. He must be a sufficient in his ownership of the caf√©, while unseen problems start to complicate his life. Little hints to the past and future probably pop up through out the film. While nothing crazy and whacked out happens in this film. It stays true to its strengths and delivers a solid film. Also to mention, Humprey Bogarts acting, most importantly his emotion and sometimes lack of emotion hold very well in the plot of the film. While this film did not blow me away. It was done very well in a simple fashion",Null,0,2,3 March 2016
