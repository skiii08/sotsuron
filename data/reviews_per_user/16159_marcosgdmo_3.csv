Your Name.," My heart has been seduced
","I'm not an huge anime fan, but even I can see the quality in this film.'Kimi no na wa' tells a story of two teenage kids, who swap bodies. Such a simple premise becomes (thanks to stunning visuals, amazing direction, great plot and a extremely touching story) in one of the best animated films I have ever seen. Close to Ghibli's standards in terms of animation and imaginative story.Everything, from the character development to the animation works perfectly to subjugate and move the viewer to the point where it wont handle the tears. Not in a melodramatic and cloying way, but in a compelling and amusing way instead.This film will just amaze you.",9,2,4,3 February 2017
Justice League," A total mess.
","A headache. That's all this movie gave me. Knowing the problems the production went through explains the result, but still a 300 million dollar budget wasted. With this huge budget you should make something at least decent, but we got Justice League.The movie looks ugly. The re-shoots are obvious and extremely shocking. Not because Whedon's style is ugly and Snyder's good looking, but because the mixture of both generates a contrast so big and noticeable it ends up being distracting.Plot is non existent. Scenes just happen with no substance or reason. The villain is just a placeholder, he is a literal mcguffin looking for three mcguffins to create a bigger mcguffin.The heroes are boring and uninteresting, they tried to make them likable with humor but it is poorly written as the rest of the film. Their actions and decisions are stupid and generate more problems than solutions.The editing is painfully awful. Creates continuity errors and kills the passing. The final product feels incomplete, like a chain of unrelated scenes that are next to each other for some reason.",2,11,21,23 November 2017
Beauty and the Beast," A good tribute to a great film, but forgettable
","What can you do when you have to remake one of the greatest animated films ever made by Disney into a Live Action Motion Picture? The risks are many. This films manages to recreate the great music and the entertainment value of the original one, but fails to recreate its essence or create a new one. In terms of Character development, it has some troubles with the main characters. They are sympathetic, but the depth behind them is flat. Emma Watson's performance is pretty disappointing, this is pretty obvious with the poor screenplay written for her role. The supporting characters are other story, they are part of what keeps this film going, besides the great music. Talking about visual effects, the movie keeps the great work we saw in 'The Jungle Book', maybe not as stunning, but still pretty good.In summary, this film despite of being entertaining, it fails to stand on its own, paying the price of being loyal to the original. I have to say, this is understandable, but stills a problem.I would say this is a good film, but feels small compared to the masterpiece of the animated version",5,3,8,27 March 2017
