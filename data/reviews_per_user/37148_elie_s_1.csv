Skyfall," Not the best bond movie ever made
","IT MAY CONTAIN SPOLERS!I went to the movies with very high expectation on the new bond movie i read couple of reviews and saw this good rating, after the movie ended i had a huge disappointment and couldn't understand this huge BUZZ that they gave for this movieis this the best bond movie made till day! for me Certainly its not!!!if anyone watched the movie and is now reading my review can they tell me if SKYFALL have any difference of for example DIE HARD 4! i am talking about the plot AN EX IM6 gone rogue and is after the HEAD of the division and BOND is trying to stop him! the ending was for me devastating and so much boring that i thought after watching a 2 hours and 20 minutes movie that the writer were so bored that they didn't want to finish the script!!!i have to give it for the director SAM MENDES it was well directed although i couldn't follow a lot of loophole maybe its the writers fault For the acting Daniel Craig has performed this role so perfectly and so for Judi Dench not to mention Javier Bardem was amazingthe only character i had issues with and seemed to have no acting skills and shouldn't be with these movie stars was NAOMIE HARRIS whoever this actress is, she was OVER acting i don't know if i am using the right term she was making herself tough and its obviously NOT WORKING and was so lame and stupid in acting one last thing maybe it is me, but come to watch a bond movie i have the anticipation of this high tech new gadget that we cant see except in the famous BOND MOVIES come to Skyfall only one stupid gadget called the radio transmitter or whatever is shown, the weapon used in the last scene where knife and hand crafted bomb!!!i am still very disappointed in SKYFALL it has a couple of action scene but all in all it just deserve 4 stars",4,12,26,3 November 2012
