The Hangover," Adolescent Driven Garbage
","I don't get it. I just don't get it. Why is this film so popular? Why does it make so much money? Why does it have such a high rating? Maybe I'm a humorless schmuck. Then again, maybe it's everybody else.When I watched the Hangover, I was indefinitely expecting a hilarious movie, especially given how much my friends seemed to adore it. Well you know what? I left the theater wondering what all the fuss was about. By that I mean, I was wondering how such a crass, stupid, humorless piece of crap could garner so much attention. The Good: The concept is original and has potential. The movie features a Korean actor, the casting crew's way of keeping the movie relevant to those of oriental background.The Bad:The Jokes - there doesn't really seem to be any. The movie relies predominately on 'zany scenarios', mostly involving some form of gross out humor, brutal injury, and a verbal assault of out of place cursing. Seriously, since when is the death of a minister supposed to be funny? If that's the case, then the videos of 9-11 are downright hysterical.The 'R-rated' Content - The film contains a lot of attempts to shock its audience, which I guess the idiots interpret as funny... I don't know. This includes a foul mouthed Wedding Singer, making a baby look like it is masturbating, and a naked man jumping out of the trunk of a car and beating the protagonists. You just can't find quality writing like this anymore.Pointless, Gratuitous Porny Shots - Movie has a fair amount of unnecessary nudity, including nipple shots, naked me; whether you care about this is really dependent on whether you've graduated High School yet. And to top off such a well crafted movie, we get a slideshow during the credits - basically an excuse to show softcore porn to the audience. Classy!So as you can probably tell, I hate this movie, and that is all that she wrote I guess1 out of 10",1,6,11,28 May 2013
Man of Steel," Man of S***
","Man of Steel.... you could have been so great. You could have brought us a new superhero franchise to look forward to, something akin to the Dark Knight Trilogy. Instead you brought a failure of a movie, in almost all regards. Before I continue though, I should let all you readers know that my ranking for this movie is not 1 out of 10, as the stars may indicate. My real rating will come at the end of this review. The reason I put up 1 star in the rating section is because I feel that the overall rating is far too high, and this is my foolish attempt to counteract that rating. Now then, let's take a look at Man of Steel, and why it goes so terribly wrong.First off, I am not a superman fan. In fact, I am not much of a superhero fan. Thus, I never review superhero movies by how closely they follow the source material, nor do I get upset when a superhero movie spits in the face of its source material. I look at Superhero movies as regular movies, judging them by how well they perform in the parameters they create for themselves. And it is as a regular movie, that Man of Steel truly fails.Plot: First and foremost, I thought the plot was... so - so. It certainly had potential, and it most certainly could have entertained. The problem is, it didn't. The first half of the movie started out great. We get some interesting back story, character development, etc. But the moment Superman leaves General Zod's ship, the s*** really hits the fan. All plot is dropped, dialogue goes to hell, all hope is lost. It seems as if those who made this movie simply gave up and figured an hour of explosions and fight scenes would carry this movie to the finish line. Suffice to say, it fails miserably, leaving the viewer in a furious rage. In addition, there are numerous plot holes in this movie, far too many for me to deal with, as I'm sure other reviewers already have.Direction: I am aware that there are some people who enjoy Zack Snyder's work. I am not one of them. The man is a total buffoon and should not be let anywhere near a camera. He may believe his work is edgy and unique, but it is simply annoying. Why won't the camera stay still? Why can't it give us a direct angle? Why won't it focus on what is actually going on in the scene instead of leaving most of the action off to the side of the picture? Watching this movie is like experiencing a dream. You wake up knowing what happened in the dream, but you can't really recall ever seeing the events unfold. That's because you didn't, because the bloody camera wouldn't stay still long enough to let you see what's happening. Another problem is the editing. I swear they managed to fit in hundreds of different shots in one 5 minute scene. Needless to say, the direction was my least favorite part of this movie.Screenplay: Simply terrible. This screenplay is simply terrible. The dialogue makes me want to kill myself. It's that bad. If you're used to smart dialogue from such classics as the Godfather, Pulp Fiction, or Goodfellas, be prepared to want to rip your ears off. Trust me, if you're not deaf after the sound effects in this movie (more on this later), you'll wish you had been.I cannot believe David S. Goyer, who worked on the Dark Knight, managed to put out this garbage. If you ever watch another film with Chris Nolan attached, be sure its Jonathon Nolan writing the screenplay, and not this hack.Special Effects: Reasonably good. Personally, I hate movies that overuse special effects (and when I say overuse, I mean they're used in just about every scene). No special effect, no matter how good, is ever going to convince me that it's real. But that's not where this movie suffers. Where it really falls apart is the sound effects, which are simply brutal on the ears. An hour of loud explosion sounds does not exactly make up for the terrible dialogue.Acting: Probably the best part of the movie. I have no reason to fault the actors. They did the best with what they were given. No Oscar winners here, but they did an admirable job.So, in conclusion, this is movie that fails in just about every way possible. By the end, I simply wanted to leave and forget about it. For that reason, I give it 3 out of 10 stars, as the the first half was watchable and the acting was pretty good.",1,15,26,13 July 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," Bizarre, Frustrating, Cinematic, Great!
","A few days ago, I decided that as a film buff it was completely unacceptable that I had never seen a Kubrick film. So as of late I've been watching the heck out of every film he made, and loving every minute of it. My latest venture was Kubrick's classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. I have to say, as a film, I really enjoyed 2001. The SFX are spectacular, a true marvel of their time, effects that stand the test of time better than almost anything in the industry. The cinematography is beautiful and Kubrick's direction is spot on for the most part. The score is great, everything from The Blue Danube to the iconic 2001 theme is spot on and well utilized throughout the film.To address the elephant in the room, 2001, at many points, is a boring film. Pacing is slow, landscape and developing shots are long and drawn out, and the lack of dialogue throughout most of the movie simply contributes to a sometimes-boring experience. In particular, the opening shots for TMA-1 seem to stretch on forever. Make no mistake, this is not your mediocre, explosion-every-five-seconds action flick, and in many ways, this is a good thing.The other knock I have against this movie is its lack of emotion. Kubrick's films can often lack emotional expression, and I think that tendency is manifested in 2001. Actors, either by their own decision or Kubrick's direction, rarely display any shows of emotion, although I found that at most points this suited the movie as a whole.My last point has to do with 2001's ending, the most bizarre, confusing, and beautiful part of the film. Personally, I had to go look up an interview with Kubrick explaining it to fully understand its meaning, it is that strange. Yet, it is my favourite part of the movie, as it brings something profound and breathtaking to an otherwise slowly paced movie.It's a little bizarre, but once you figure it out, it ties up the movie perfectly.8 out of 10, but given the slow pace, I doubt most viewers will enjoy it :(.",10,1,3,25 May 2013
