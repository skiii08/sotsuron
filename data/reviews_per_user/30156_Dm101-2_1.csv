The Blair Witch Project," Just great!!!
","I think that the blair witch project was definetely one of a kind. Scenery,cast,and overall eeriness made it a cant only see once flick.it is unique since it has been done in a documentary type of film and not only does it leave the imagination free to turn things around but it also has a very very sick humor to it. i rate it a perfect 10!!!",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
