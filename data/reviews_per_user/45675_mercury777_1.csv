Requiem for a Dream," Unnerving and entertaining. Do yourself a favor and see it without reading the reviews.
",Great flick.  Unnerving and entertaining.  I think that seeing it blind (no reviews) would be the best way to go...just expect a bumpy ride and be prepared for drugs and some sex.  Visually a knockout and a must for Ellen Burstyn's performance.,9,0,0,21 November 2000
