Miracle," Miracle
","'Miracle' tells a fantastic story of the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team's victory over the powerful Soviet Union. This film also combines important events in history, as we well know the Olympics can never create world peace as long as hate stands. But besides that, I believe this movie has made an advantage to gain support from the theater audience as they too were clapping, screaming 'USA', and holding their breath to see what would happen. Getting the audience and myself involved in cheering the fictional team is something that I would've never expected. This film takes your mind off the acting and the technically the film has created, and puts you (the audience) in a position that you actually are at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, and that your cheering on your home team (USA). The cast is amazing, the sport is more and more fun and exciting, and I believe that this film will do extemely well in theaters for fans of hockey, fans of Olympic Games, families, or any ordinary Jor or Jane looking for a good time at the movies. Bottom line, 'Miracle' is spectacular in its own way.Rating for 'Miracle' - 9/10",9,0,0,31 January 2004
Elizabeth," The Portrait of 'The Virgin Queen'
","After seeing this film 1,000 times, I never get tired of watching it. Its an absolute triumph to see a intimate portrait of one of history's greatest rulers. Elizabeth Tutor is on the edge of death for treason, conspiracy, and unacceptable to be England's new monarch, but appears to be ambitious to restore England, capture the conspirators, and be viewed as the women that would alter the course of the Renaissance period. All in all, the virgin queen is a person worth knowing - 9 1/2 out of 10.",9,0,0,11 April 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," My favorite movie
","SPOILERS! Every time I watch this movie I feel like I'm falling in love all over again. Bridget is soooo lovable. It's a fact! Why else would two dishy men like Daniel and Mark be all over her. Let's face it -- Daniel is a dog. But Mark is a very well educated, accomplished man. I'm so glad that Bridget ends up with someone so worthy of her and her sweetness and good heart.Mark is very cautious because he has been hurt before. Therefore, his willingness to proclaim his feelings for Bridget and commit to her must be very difficult for him but he does because he wants Bridget in his life. Since he is an attorney, I would also assume he is very analytical and has looked at his relationship with Bridget from every angle imaginable.I also think that Bridget might remind him a little of his mother. Remember, folks, his mother is the one who picked out his Christmas ties and wanted to fix up Bridget and Mark in the first place. Also, Mark has seen how happy his parents have been for 40 years, so his mother's playfulness and humor probably contributed a lot to that fact. Besides, Mark has worked hard to become a very accomplished and well-thought of attorney, and he needs to balance it with the love, affection, sweetness, silliness, tenderness, and humor that Bridget can offer. I just love this movie.",10,4,6,18 November 2005
Love Actually," What's not to love???
","Every single story line would have made a wonderful movie in and of itself. I thought the criss crossing of the various plots and characters would be confusing, but I felt it was very clever the way the stories were woven together.  The movie flowed - very much like watching a dance.  Every cast member has been a favorite of mine for years so that was an added bonus to see them all together in the same film.  I am expecting many more wonderful movies from the cast and Richard Curtis.  Well done! Bravo!",Null,0,1,14 November 2003
