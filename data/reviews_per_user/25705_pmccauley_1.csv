The Legend of Bagger Vance," More than just a golf movie...
","As is always the case, a movie that cannot do justice to its printed predecessor.  Nonetheless, a wonderful movie, especially in the current cinematic context.Others have mentioned the lack of 'filling in the details.'  In fact, this is one of my requirements for a good movie.  If one is left with no questions after viewing a film (or any piece of art) then the product was obviously not evocative enough.  An extended war piece is not necessary to 'explain' a veteran's shellshock at losing his whole company.  A day-by-day recitation of a romance is not necessary for understanding characters' later motivations.  Not all father-son conflicts in real life are resolved with lengthy 'grown up' discussions. like they are in movies.The 'point' of the story was not driven home hard enough for my taste. Junah's search for, and Bagger's description of, the 'authentic swing' is what the story is all about.  I think the movie would have profited by focusing more on the Bagger/Junah dynamic and Junah's quest than on the love interest.Go see the movie, then read the book.  I think you'll be richer for it.
BTW, a black caddie sitting in an empty locker room waiting for his player's shoes would not have been that unusual.",10,0,1,3 November 2000
