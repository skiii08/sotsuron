The Rock," Escapist, over the top entertainment in the best sense
","Sean Connery in wonderful form, Nick Cage's crazy character works, Ed Harris is excellent and very good, over the top action. Some great one-liners.",10,2,2,8 April 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Genuine thriller
","What many others have said, this is a real movie with a story and characters, plus first action action sequence direction. Wasn't sure what this would be like when I started streaming it to fill in some dead time, got halfway through before I needed to go to bed and actually WANTED to see the rest of the movie the next day. Good to see the under-used Redford in a recent role and Jenny Agutter too.Knocked one star off for the non-stop machine pistol stuff which I'm sure influences teens, but the movie stands by itself as an action movie.",9,1,2,24 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Way too long, over-melodramatic, incomprehensible
","Too bad there isn't a zero star rating. I am not the target demo, was dragged to the movie theater by my young son to see it (he thought the movie was OK. I didn't.1. Lots of nothing much happens
2. Lots of melodramatic music
3. The movie at 182 minutes is about 82 minutes too long
4. The Thor character ceases to become comic amusement about a third through the pic
5. Incomprehensible and repeated fight scenes
6. Exceptionally poor dialog in the screenplayVisually the only star turns were Brie Larson and Elizabeth Olsen. The Scarlet Witch, one of the stronger themes was barely in this - Olsen should get her own movie.I was three hours of my life back plus $68 bucks spent on tickets and popcorn at AMC.",1,293,519,20 May 2019
