The Equalizer," A waste of screen talent....
","Expecting a literate interpretation of the oh-so famous (iconic?) Edward Woodward 'Equalizer' this was a total disgrace to that theme and title. Woodwards Equalizer was understated, intelligent, well acted, complex in character and storyline and thus engrossing and entertaining. This thin poorly written 'shot-em up' show case for Denzel is a pointless showcase for his depth or even his screen charisma. (Surely he didn't read this before he signed in??) The story is so flawed it reeks of 'somebody didn't attend the read thru' of this screen play...without spoiling.... just watch for the huge disconnects in time-line AND locations once the so called 'action' begins.(And THAT to take forever given the vapidness of this over-used dialogue). The music simply drowns this film in some supposed 'dark power vibe' that never matches the scene or the transitions particularly. The 'drone' even over rides some key Denzel dialogue (and our new theater is DHL certified so was not the sound system). It didn't 'fit'... didn't add and certainly was annoying at best. Denzel has a few charming moments.... but as a menace??/ never.... neither the scenes nor dialogue supported that. NOT a salute to the classy, involved , intelligent, entertaining 'Equalizer' Woodward immortalized....and really painful watching Denzel trying to make something out of this boring story. First neg post I've written in years.... but.... wow. Pass on this one.",2,29,64,30 September 2014
