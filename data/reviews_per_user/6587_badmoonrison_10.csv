Requiem for a Dream," Dear god... this movie is unreal.
","This was barely a movie... more like a bad trip.I started watching this movie around 1 am, and finished somewhere around 3 am. Immediately afterwards, I almost broke down in tears. The downward progression of these four pitiful individuals is enough to make you sick. It truly could be the most moving movie I've ever seen.This movie is a horrifying close-up of the junkies down the alley, the pill-freaks up in the single apartments. It takes you from the initial high to the very end. Every one of these four actors deserves some kind of award... they had me convinced 100%. Not once in the movie do they actually say 'heroin'... it's always slang.This movie features a scene that is one of two scenes I've had to look away from while watching. Actually, several scenes could qualify as a 'can't watch' for many people. But this movie is a 'MUST WATCH'... trust me. If not you, show it to your 16-year-old.",10,0,1,2 April 2009
Friday Night Lights," ... Simply amazing.
","This is my favorite sports movie ever. Maybe my favorite movie ever. Watch FNL if you've ever played football or dreamed of playing football, and you'll feel compelled to get back out on the field and START HITTING PEOPLE!!! Our H.S. football team saw it together, and the next day we were smashing each other twice as hard. This movie gets the blood pumping. It has everything. The silent leader. The loudmouth super(super-super-super)-star. The timid kid with enormous potential. The messed-up one who's home life you can't help but question. The wise, always-knows-what-to-do coach. Everyone in the town is counting on these kids to win and bring it all home. It will blow you away.I'm buying this the second it comes out on DVD.Highly, highly recommended.",Null,0,2,22 December 2004
Unbreakable," A thinker's movie.
","In today's media, everything is flash, bang, boom, here it comes.MTV's music videos come at you with wild lights and barely-viewable scenes that don't make much sense anyways.Sportscenter's 'Ultimate Highlight' is an unwatchable jumble ofquick, cutting camera edits timed to fast paced music. Is this whatthe typical American wants? Who else is someone who can standa little well-timed silence? Who else enjoys subtle motions, orquiet lines that resonate throughout the rest of a film?'Unbreakable' is a movie for you. Throughout the film, cunningcamera angles, the aforementioned subtle motions and quiet lines,and an innovative plot made me captivated. Other reviews on thissite call this movie 'boring' or 'a waste of time'. Have you nopatience? I personally enjoyed this movie. Me, a 16-year-oldgrowing up in the MTV generation. Can't the adults at leastappreciate this flick?",9,2,4,12 November 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Disappointing.
","I went to this movie because a friend told me that he had bought a ticket for me for the midnight showing. So I go at midnight an hour early, and anticipate a great movie since I thoroughly enjoyed the first. I was confused through the whole movie. I couldn't tell what was going on, and what character's motivations were for the things they did. The CGI was good, admittedly. The main 'boss' was a stunning compilation of squid tentacles... although I'm not sure why. This was just one of many things never really explained. I got sick of Jack's antics and people in the theater cheering for everything he did. Stuff lagged on way too long.I recommend seeing the first one before going. It will explain a lot to you for future references during the second one.I also felt cheated at the end when I realized this is only a half of a movie.",4,2,4,8 July 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not good.
","I saw this movie with two friends the day it came out. We thought it would be packed, but to our surprise the theater only yielded about 50% of its capacity. Was this a sign of things to come?The whole thing with the Civil War/WW1/WW2/Vietnam War was pretty cool... until I realized that Logan was Canadian and probably wouldn't have been involved in any of those conflicts. I became concerned almost immediately afterwards when I saw Logan, Victor, and their tight little 'squad' running up on an African diamond king, and their Asian homie jumps over a fence, spins around like 30 times, shoots about 15 guards and lands like a Dragonball Z character. I then proceed to become VERY concerned when I see RYAN REYNOLDS (you know, the loser from Van Wilder) running around and deflecting... bullets... with his swords. WTF? I tried to stay positive, but so many things about this movie prompted laughter from our camp. Possibly the most ridiculous scene was when Logan sparked his claws on the ground, started a perfect gasoline fire in a straight line that led to a crashed helicopter, and walked away somehow not noticing the massive explosion behind him. CORNY. There are countless action scenes like this that go so far beyond ever making sense.The action is pretty cool, and there are some sweet mutant powers like teleportation, diamond skin, and the tight stuff pulled by Creole swindler Remy LeBeau - a.k.a. Gambit. But what was with the CGI? They used it about as much as Star Wars Episode I. Why do lumberjacks need to be computer animated? Why do Wolverine's claws look straight out of a N64 game from 1997? There are just too many glaring holes to respect this movie. I wanted to enjoy it, believe me... unfortunately, Van Wilder and the N64 claws made that impossible.",4,19,37,3 May 2009
Wanted," Has action, not substance.
","I like the idea. Lots of reviewers find this movie unoriginal, but really, what action movie is? People seem to hold The Matrix as the pinnacle of sci-fi, but it has glaring similarities to Star Wars and even the Bible. Originality out the window, this is a decent movie to watch for lots of bullets and car chases. Just don't expect anything too deep.The cast was immensely flawed. The main character McEnvoy is almost... too typical. It seemed like this character was a wimpy tool turned killing machine solely to cater to the 20-something video game crowd (did the office scenes remind anyone else of Office Space?). I started to hate the 'fraternity' almost as much as I hate real-life frats, as every member had a stupid arrogant smirk on their face like 'I know something you don't' times 100. I don't think a single assassin changed expressions once, as they went from smug to overly-smug.The special effects are love/hate. I liked the car chases and most of the shootings, except for the bullets colliding mid-air. That was cool the first time, but since its an event that has likely never happened or ever will happen, it grew tired by about the fourth repetition. One thing that absolutely disgusted me was how the main character survived the farthest fall EVER, with no major injuries.If you want to see a quick flick with lots of action, this is a good pick. The stereotypical characters/story elements, however, were VERY questionable at times and just reminded me of those kids in middle school that were always fake-shooting each other and trying to do Matrix moves in gym class.",6,6,14,30 December 2008
Gran Torino," A great film, highly recommended.
","I saw this film after a good word from a friend. I'm very happy I took the time to view it! Clint Eastwood is a perfectly-played, gruff, old man in a changing world. He puts the safety of his neighborhood into his own hands. What's surprising is that this isn't the whole story; much of the movie is dedicated to building relationships and coming to understand Walt Kowalski.I especially appreciated the accurate references to the Hmong culture. My grandmother worked in social work for their people for many years, and the fashion and even home decorations are legitimate and detailed.A must-see! Really an exceptional film.",9,2,6,31 January 2009
Gangs of New York," Brilliant, captivating, exciting
","I saw this movie about five years ago, and watched it again in 2009 on a whim. I was pleasantly reminded of why I had such great memories of it to begin with.Leo shows us again why he's a great leading man, as a young Irish immigrant seeking to avenge his father's death. Daniel Day-Lewis instilled fear at every moment, and convinced me to check out his other work. Knives, guns, and blunt objects are abound as immigrants and 'natives' clash. It's funny how much this movie exposes those that think they are the 'true American natives' when really, everyone was an immigrant at one point.I also enjoyed how three different people were praying to the same God for polar-opposite intentions. It showed how God can be used as an excuse for... anything, including battle (sound familiar?).Overall, this movie was stellar. It was exciting at almost all times and exposed the grimy, ruthless side of 1860's NYC. 9/10",9,1,2,27 March 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Something every American teenager should watch... forget it, every American period.
","This is how things really are in the rest of the world.The kids from Slumdog and others like them don't have Blackberries, Facebook, or iPods; they live in the poorest of situations and yet still strive for success. They wear rags for clothes, often have no one to rely on but themselves, and still manage a smile.Slumdog Millionaire is a great film, one that immerses you in the slums of India. We follow Jamal, a young worker at a telemarketing company who finds himself on the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' He is brought in for questioning, as he has almost achieved the illustrious task of making it 'all the way.' We find out that he knows the answers because of his previous life experiences.Along with the millionaire plot, we track the lives of Jamal, his brother, and his love interest from childhood to adulthood. Each character is unique and interesting, and leaves only to come back into the story again.The story is captivating, moving fast and furiously. It's an exciting ride through the slums of India, as we see our hero move from rags to riches... and everything in between.",9,3,12,25 February 2009
Valkyrie," A good, intellectual effort
","7/10 So what if I think Cruise is a wacko for his Scientologist ways? This movie proved to be a very smart, high-tension thriller from beginning to end. Cruise did a nice job as Stauffenberg, the crippled colonel who finds himself in the middle of a plot to kill the Fuhrer. The other supporting actors are also good, although I think some German accents would have done wonders for the realism effect.The last half of the movie is pure suspense. I had the misfortune of sitting next to some goon who insisted on narrating the whole film... if that guy never existed, I think I would have enjoyed Valkyrie a lot more. Nonetheless, this is a good movie to take a trip back 70 years and see a different side of the National Socialist Party. It's funny, I assumed all this time that EVERY Nazi thought the same way; I never thought that there could be opponents within the regime that were simply scared into following. This is their story... enjoy!",7,3,5,30 December 2008
