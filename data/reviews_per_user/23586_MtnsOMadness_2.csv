The Avengers," Bar-None Best Super Hero Movie Ever
","Joss Whedon pulled off what many said could not be done. He created a super hero epic with a team of super-heroes. Many excuses have been used over the years (It will be too expensive and never recoup the cost, too many plots to tie together, every actor(ess) will want to be the major focus and blah blah blah), but now everyone knows it can be done and done well.The scope of this project was years in the making starting with Iron Man back in 2008, followed by The Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Thor. These movies filled in the back story for all but three of the characters in the Avengers (Hawkeye, the Black Widow and Nick Fury even though Nick Fury shows up in all of the movies and Black Widow and Hawkeye make guest appearance in Iron Man and Thor respectively). This 'back story' allows Joss to focus on the plot of this movie instead of having to explain how all the heroes came to be.There is not an actor or actress in this movie that didn't pull off their role excellently. I am not sure whether this is do the quality of actors or Joss Whedon's devotion to comic books and his directing prowess. I think the surprise in this film though has to go to the Hulk and Bruce Banner played by Mark Ruffalo. He had just the right amount of innocence and hidden angst as Banner and his one liners as the Hulk were spot on. Another discovered gem, although we saw her before in Iron Man, was Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow. Her ability to use her supposed feminine frailty as a weapon was a surprise each time it was used.The villain Loki played by Tom Hiddleston was outstanding as well. Loki and the alien menace he contacted were the perfect combination to threaten the entire planet and bring together the worlds greatest heroes to defend their home.If you do not know this it probably means you have been living under a rock in movie land. Almost all Comic Moves now have a 'hidden' Easter egg after the credits. This movie had two such Easter Eggs.I can't say enough good things about this movie so if you haven't seen it and you consider yourself a comic book fan then you should be banned from all geek fest's hence forth until you have seen this movie. For all the rest of you out there .... Go See This Movie.The Panel votes: Cthulhu: 10 out of 10 (Thanos is awesome. I am so excited, I killed 300 dreamers on the cruise ship Atlantis when it floated too close to the lost city of Rlyeh) Fuzzy Toad: 8 out of 10 (Comic book violence is high and children under 8 might get scared of the Hulk and alien invaders. If they are a fan of Comic books however I am sure they will love it.) Mouth-Breather: 12 out of 10 (OMG! OMG! Best movie ever.... And I told all you losers Hulk could beat Thor.) Frat-Boy Bob: 10 out of 10 (Scarlett Johannson is delicious. The action was awesome. 'Puny God' LMAO...) The Queen in Yellow: 7 out of 10 (Still tired of Comic Book movies but this one is very exciting.) Azathoth: Googol out of Infinity (Whispers of madness in the dark) (************Super Spoiler Alert*************) For those of you who have not seen the movie do not read past here.I think one of the best part of the villainy is who was revealed at the end of the movie. The true menace to mankind and a power that dwarfs that of Loki and quite possibly the Avengers themselves.The first Easter Egg showed us who the villain behind Loki was in this movie and who will be the villain in the next movie. That villain is Thanos the lover of Death herself.The second Easter Egg you have to see for yourself.",10,7,13,21 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Best Spider-Man Movie to date
","I am a huge fan of comic books. Thought I should get that out of the way up front.I was very skeptical of this movie up front for two reasons. One is the choice of a British actor (Andrew Garfield) to play Peter Parker. Two is that I was concerned about remaking the beginning when it was done so well in the Sam Raimi version with Tobey Maguire as Peter.This movie blew me away. Andrew Garfield was able to pull off the American teen accent and affectations with no problem. But to be more specific, he pulled off Peter Parker's worried, self-doubting, bad luck infused, angst ridden but light hearted teen-age attitude with great aplomb. Emma Stone played an excellent Gwen Stacy and the chemistry between Andrew and Emma was outstanding. Dr Conner / The Lizard (played by Rhys Ifans) was the second best villain to date in a Spider-Man movie beaten only by Alfred Molina's version of Doctor Octopus in Spider-man 2.One of the things that really set this off from the Sam Raimi Spider-man movies was how Spider-man moved. His fights with The Lizard in the school and on top of the empire State building displayed the lightning fast reflexes and use of surroundings that Spider-Man was known for in the comic books. Another point that was more like the original Spider-Man in the comics is Spider-Man's use of homemade web-shooters instead of the biological web-shooters that were used in the Sam Raimi version. And finally, the use of Gwen Stacy as Peter's first love (and the obvious setup for the whole Gwen Stacy story over the next movie or two) is critical for the development of the Spider-Man persona as created by Stan Lee in the comic books. I would go so far as saying that the Gwen Stacy story is as important in the creation of the Spider-man persona as was the death of Uncle Ben and the loss of Peter's parents.This is not to disparage the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies because I really liked them as well (except for Spider-Man 3 which was a mish-mash of too many villains and plot lines).I highly recommend this movie to any fan of Spider-Man and of the comic book movie genre.The Panel Votes: Cthulhu: 6 out of 10 (The villain reminded me of a Deep One which is nice but the fact that the spandex clad hero won in the end was a huge disappointment) Fuzzy Toad: 9 out of 10 (This movie is great for the young ones. There are some scenes of comic book violence and some images of the Lizard that may be too intense for some children under 8.) Mouth-Breather: 10 out of 10 (Loved this movie in all respects. Somewhat confused though because I think Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man could take Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man) Frat-Boy: 7 out of 10 (Nice action scenes. Emma Stone is hot. Not enough hot chicks and no nudity.) The Queen in Yellow: 4 out of 10 (If I never see another super hero movie it will be too soon.) Azathoth: 100 out of Pi (A twisted cacophony of flute piping fills your mind)",9,2,5,21 August 2012
