Miracle," Great Underdog Story Is An Instant Classic
","Miracle is rare gem stashed among today's big budget films:  It's truly a remarkable film.  If you're looking for awesome computer-generated effects, Ben Affleck paired with a mediocre female popstar crossover, a blazing hip-hop soundtrack, or scantily-clad hotel chain heiresses, this film is definitely not your game.  However, if you are sophisticated enough to appreciate great storytelling without any gimmicks, this true underdog tale will leave you feeling inspired.  Guys, this is our 'Steel Magnolias' (in a happy sort of way), but don't let your girlfriend see you all choked up.Exceptional writing, acting, and directing all contribute to the film's credibility and raw emotion.  Kurt Russell is superb as the ambitious head coach Herb Brooks, whose 'tough love' tactics invoke a mix of fear, admiration, and respect in his young players.  The rest of the largely unknown cast, including Patrick O'Brien Demsey as team captain Mike Eruzione and Eddie Cahill (goalie Jim Craig), shine as well.  While you may be equally unfamiliar with director Gavin O'Connor, he's done his job because you will feel like you're sitting behind the goal at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, rooting for Team USA to beat the Soviet champions.Miracle should prove to Disney executives that great movies can still be made without relying on 3D animation; maybe this film's success will provide some leverage in future negotiations with Pixar.  Corporate politics aside, Miracles is a truly a must-see experience for the entire family.  Even if you're too young to remember gas rationing or Mean Joe Green commercials, you will love Miracles.  Who knows, perhaps even Russians or (gasp) Canadians will love it?",9,0,0,1 February 2004
