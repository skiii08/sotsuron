Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode I doesn't have the warmth of Episode IV.
","Episode I doesn't  have the warmth of the characters as Episode IV, V and VI, and maybe is not going to change the life of so many, as did A New Hope, because we already grew up with the adventures of Luke Skywalker.The main thing about Episode I is that it works as introduction of Episode II and III. Is like as if Lucas put the pieces in the board, to return in 3 years and show us the rest.Is like the Sunday matinee that Lucas always say is Star Wars Saga, but this time you just have a little adventure as excuse to know the characters.The best sequence is with the  Podracers, as the chariots of BEN HUR, because remembers you the magic of the old trilogy, with the human spirit fighting against the bad guys.But you have to go to see it for yourself. Kids are going to love Anakin, because he looks so cool flying those ships!!!.Maybe next movie, Lucas will use more girls to encourage female audience to see the movie.",8,1,2,13 May 1999
