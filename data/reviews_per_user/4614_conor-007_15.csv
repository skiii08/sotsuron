National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Great Sequel! Better than the First!
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets is the sequel to the hugely successful National Treasure. In my opinion it is better than the first. Better characters, better story and better action. The storyline is fantastic with great twists and turns that the audience doesn't expect. With great locations and stunning set pieces it's just nearly as good as Indiana Jones. Nicolas Cage is a great actor who is successful in any role. It's another great movie from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, one of today's greatest action movie producers. If yo thought National Treasure then prepared to be amazed at National Treasure: Book of Secrets",Null,0,2,11 February 2008
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," One of the Best Disney Movies Ever!
","101 Dalmations is perhaps the Best Disney film ever made. The story, characters, animation, detail, colour and music was spot on. I mean who doesn't love this movie? Cruella De Vil is definitely one of the best Disney Villains of all time. She's wonderfully evil and cruel. Skinning puppies is quite a ruthless plan which can scare audiences. We can easily see that the animators have out a lot of work into this film. The voice talents were cast perfectly. Betty Lou Gerson nailed it as Cruella.101 Dalmations is a film which should be remembered and treasured forever.Thanks for reading.",Null,2,2,6 March 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," It's Great- But Just A few Things I Would Change
","I saw this film recently, and I have to say I was pretty impressed, however there are just a few problems I would fix.1. Too Much Comedy Far too much of it. Jack just looked too drunk and clumsy. There were very interesting and edge of your seat scenes such as the Maelstrom Sequence. But then its spoiled by a silly joke.2. Deaths I have to say, Jones, Soa Feng, Norrington and Beckett had pretty unimpressive and anti-climatic deaths. I think they could have been improved a bit.3. Length Almost every person has mentioned the length. It's just too long. Half the stuff they didn't need.Overall, I thought it was really good, just a few minor adjustments would make it better.Thank you for reading.",Null,2,2,15 June 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," A Bit Too Predictable
","Resident Evil Extinction is an okay movie. The characters are interesting and the action is brilliant. The problem is it's a little too predictable. The director uses the following movie tricks which have been used in just about every horror movie I have seen:a) Slow motion movie trick b) The open the door trick c) Mistaking the mirror for a real person trick d) The out of no-where zombie trickThe movie plot seems to have been used time and time again.The human race have been destroyed and only a few survivors remain. They have an bunch of flesh-eating zombies on their tale and it's up to the survivors to kill them.On the bright side, if angry, half dead zombies and sexy looking heroes are your thing then you'll enjoy Resident Evil Extinction!Thanks for reading.",Null,0,1,13 October 2007
The Terminator," Not as Good as Terminator 2 but Still a Good Watch.
","The Terminator is not as good as it's sequel in my opinion. However, its still a good watch. The story is one of the best and most interesting I have ever seen. Schwarzenegger is great as the villain sent back through time to kill the mother of a future leader at all costs. I mean. Who doesn't love that? It's basically a massive long chase movie. When the action starts it doesn't stop and it doesn't stop for breath.If thrills, chills and action are your thing then be sure to check out The Terminator.Enjoy and thanks for reading!",Null,0,1,24 November 2007
Armageddon," Prepare to be Amazed!
","Armageddon is a great film. It is one of the best in its genre. My favourite Michael Bay film used to be Pearl Harbour, but not anymore. Basically, an asteroid is heading for Earth and it's up to about 8 or 9 ordinary people to go into space, drill a hole in the asteroid, plant a bomb and hopefully save the world. The chance of a bunch of ordinary people being asked to complete such a dangerous task is unlikely, but who cares? The CGI could not be better, the casting is superb and there is just the right amount of comedy without making it silly. At times it does get too Star Wars-ish but the rest is very realistic. It is a superb film. I really don't know why it has had such bad reviews.Deep Impact has the same premise but in that film it was like a stone was going to hit the Earth.It is no where near as good as Armageddon. This film is brilliant!Prepare to be amazed.Thanks for reading my review!",Null,4,7,6 September 2007
The Longest Day," A Fantastic War Movie!
","The Longest Day stars just about every big name of the 1960's. It was the most expensive back and white film until Schindler's List came along. The attention to detail is excellent. It shows the true horrors of the D-Day Landings and the sacrifices and struggles those men went through. The idea of showing both sides makes it a unique piece of work. Usually we are used to just seeing the Americans and the British. However in The Longest Day we get to see the successes, failures, struggles and victories of both sides. You are bound to find an actor you like. Every big name at that time makes an appearance. Look out for, John Wayne, Gert Frobe, Curt Jurgens, Kenneth More and a very young an unknown Sean Connery.If you enjoy war movies, then The Longest Day is for you!Thanks for reading.",Null,1,1,30 December 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," An Excellent Film that Should be Enjoyed by All!
","It's obvious why when every time a 'Greatest Ever Movies' type programme comes on, It's A Wonderful Life is always in the top 5. It's the perfect Christmas movie. James Stewart is a fantastic actor and one of the greatest central characters of film history. He plays a hard working, kind family man who, after some depressing chain of events wishes he was never born. His guardian angel pays him a visit and shows him what life would have been like had he not existed. The build up to this event is a little long but that's what makes the film so successful and helps us to feel Stewart's pain. It's a heart-warming, feel good tale which should be enjoyed by generation after generation!Thanks for reading!",Null,2,4,2 December 2007
Hancock," Unique Superhero Movie but a Few Changes Necessary
","Everyone can agree that Hancock is a brilliantly thought out movie. An unwanted, drunk, and careless superhero and how he deals with the public hating him.Will Smith is the only actor who could possibly fit this role. With the perfect blend of comedy and drama he pulls off this role successfully. It contains comedy at the right moments and the dramatic tension has been carefully executed.Like all my reviews there is always something I pick on. I kind of agree with other reviewers when they say you can only play the 'un-wanted superhero' for a short time. What do you do after that? We can see the writers perhaps struggled with.The other question. Where is he villain? Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk. Indiana Jones. Dark Knight all had memorable and evil villains. It was hard to distinguish who the antagonist was in this film. But I guess its mostly about Hancock and his struggle.Finally.Maybe not the best movie of the summer, but definitely worth a look.Thanks for reading and feel free to send me a comment.",Null,0,1,10 July 2008
Iron Man," A Fantastic Addition To The Superhero Genre
","Iron Man is not your typical superhero movie. Forget the screaming fans, the nerdy boy who becomes the hero, the mad scientists and the radiation experiment gone wrong. This is perhaps the perfect superhero movie. From the mind of Stan Lee comes Iron Man played brilliantly by Robert Downey J, a film with comedy, jaw-dropping effects, great villains, unique action sequences and a plot that would make Spiderman's missions look quite lame. Robert Downey Jr. Is perfect in the role as the owner of a company which builds weapons. Frankly I could not have thought of a better person in the role as Tony Stark. If you enjoy movies like Spider-Man, Transformers and X-Men then this movie is for you. The Incredible Hulk and the Dark Knight have some very stiff competition at the box office.",Null,1,3,3 May 2008
Beowulf," Another Great Movie from Zemekis
","Beowulf is another film from director Robert Zemekis. He has used the same animation technique as used in the Polar Express. Beowulf is fantastic. The detail and care taken when animating these characters has been brilliant. At times I did think these men were real people. The plot is a little bit thin but the action leaves you on the edge of your seat. Don't be fooled by the 12 rating. It's the first time I've seen animated blood and guts and the language used in it is a bit unsuitable for young kids. Beware: It gets very noisy and could frighten kids.Anyway, on the bright side, it's full of interesting characters and has a fantastic climax.By the way, I don't know why everyone is making a fuss over Angelina Jolie. She's in 3 scenes and that's it.Thanks for reading!",Null,1,3,3 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," One of the Best if not the Best Die Hard Movie
","Die Hard 4.0 has been the best summer movies of 2007. After 13 years waiting it definitely delivers. Non-stop action, thrills and jokes. The story is great and the characters have been well cast. Timothy Olyphant is fantastic as the villain, Thomas Gabriel, who is hell-bent on shutting down the entire US Computer Network. Although Bruce Willis is about 60 he's still brilliant as one of Hollywood's greatest movie heroes.The movie is superb but the only problem is the editing. It's all over the place. Luckily its only the talking scenes that are badly edited.Apart from that technical hitch, Die Hard 4.0 is a brilliant movie. Check it out! Thanks for reading.",Null,0,1,30 October 2007
The Sixth Sense," An Excellent Thriller
","I never really watch thrillers apart from United 93 But this movie was on T.V so I thought what the heck and I watched it. It blew me away. The Sixth Sense is excellent. It is unique, chilling, and you can feel the trickles of sweat rolling down your back. I take my hat off to Willis and Osment for their performances. They suited the parts perfectly. And also congratulations to M. Night Shyamalan for a superb story and for excellent directing. Seeing dead with blown out brains, burned faces and scars all over their body appear from nowhere was frightening. However I thought it was a very good idea. If you like this genre you'll like it. But if you're like me and you don't like this genre still give it a go, you'll like it also.Thank you very much for reading!",Null,2,3,8 August 2007
300," A Different and Unique Epic War Movie!
","300 is not your traditional war movie. The battles, characters, colours, story and action are different and unique. The battle sequences are the some of the best I have ever seen and they have been filmed in very interesting ways. The use of colour is extraordinary. Whether this is historically accurate I don't know, but at times it can be very fantasy like. The choice of using unknown actors makes the movie even more special. However the only downside is Gerard Butler as King Leonidas. He continuously changes his accent. The first half of the movie he's English, then speaking with a thick Scottish accent, and then back to an English accent. What's that all about? Apart from that minor problem, 300 is a fantastic war movie which should be enjoyed by all.",Null,0,3,12 January 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Simpsons Fan or Not, It's Still Worth Seeing
","I was never a Simpsons fan, that doesn't say I didn't like it, it just means I never got round to watching it.But today I thought being a movie lover I might as well go and see it.I laughed the minuted the 20th Century Fox logo went up (you'll see why I laughed when you go and see it) to the end credits. It was hilarious.I won't spoil it because I hate it when people do that.Get ready for action, laughs, romance and a new emotional side to the Simpsons family.I will definitely watch the programme now.So what are you waiting for, go and see it! You won't be disappointed! Thanks for reading!",Null,1,5,27 July 2007
