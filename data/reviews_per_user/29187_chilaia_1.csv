Skyfall," this film is shame of bondiada
","I'm not good speech writer and tell shortly. this film is shame of bondiada. I see all series of 007 but this is real trash. start scene, middle and final don't have any normal connection and also to much cyber and nothing bond style. stupidest 'Q', in previews series never see bustard-es this 'Q', Albert Broccoli and Ian Fleming must be turning in their graves, shame on you. There are so many reasons why this doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Dr No, Goldeneye or Casino Royale. skyfall was boring from the beginning to the near end. Hope next film if you make will be much better, but don't make skyfall style, this film if it's possible to call part of bondiada is real shame... wish you write better script for next that's all",4,11,19,3 August 2014
