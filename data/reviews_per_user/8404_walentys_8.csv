The King's Speech," The title betrays all suspense
","Simply by reading the title, one can figure out everything that will happen in this film. To be specific, it reveals that the narrative will center around the speech impediment, and also gives away the fact that there will be one epic well-delivered speech at the end. Sure enough, that was the case. My expectations from the title never faltered even a tiny bit.I do not even attack the title, as it is perfectly fitting, even clever. It's the narrative that feels lacking. A speech impediment alone is not a strong enough narrative for a full feature-length film. One may argue that there was more: the 'doctor', the throne, the father, the brother, the wife, perhaps garnished with a little of the 'doctor's' family life as well. But these are certainly far in the background. If one were to remove the central narrative of the speech impediment, the rest would crumble.Clearly, the director and writer chose not to make this a standard biopic or history film, given that I personally didn't learn much information about this man - and I'll shamefully admit I didn't know all that much about him going in either. This in itself is no terrible thing; not every single film about a historical era needs to be a three and a half hour David Lean biopic with the utmost accuracy and historical merit. It was a conscious choice, and not a bad one, to keep the narrative simplistic and not to tackle the entire era.Indeed there is potentially still room for a strong film even with biographical and dramatic angles not taking on a strong focus. Perhaps the psychological angle could have been expanded upon more; all we really got out of that was showing that he spoke perfectly with loud music in his ears, and flirting with the linkage of his family troubles to making his speech even worse. These angles could have been developed more, but once again they stayed too obsessed and narrow-minded on their one single theme, making the film feel a bit hollow to trudge through.Still, it wasn't all bad. Colin Firth's rendition of a stammerer was admirable, Helena Bonham Carter gave a convincing portrayal of the Queen Mother, and the whole irreverent yet warm character of Lionel Logue conveyed plenty of intrigue. The cinematography was stunning during the shot of Lionel and Bertie walking along the foggy street just before they parted ways briefly. Plus, the music of Alexandre Desplat is always a treat.All in all, it's technically strong but had too weak of a motif and needed more themes to round it out.",5,2,7,27 May 2019
The Avengers," The only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema
","The only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema and instead go in expecting some cool action, hot chicks and a few wisecracks.In this endeavor it succeeds fairly well; it is in fact almost nonstop action, and it flows well for this purpose. There's hardly a moment of relative boredom or dullness, and it keeps your attention throughout. Pacing is something many films have trouble with and this does it well.The special effects and sound editing were very well-done too. Not once did I think they were overdone or cheesy-looking/-sounding, and they packed a punch. The way the aliens looked was neat, and most of the fighting was cool to watch. What sticks out in my memory is Thor hitting his hammer against Captain America's shield, an awesomely done scene for effects.The humorous one-liners, mostly stemming from Tony Stark but also from the camaraderie among the Avengers group, also work well enough and keep you at least smiling throughout.However, I sensed a strong amount of cold, calculated filmmaking here. I felt almost no style in this entire film, and instead I felt as if Joss Whedon had a quota to fill as he was filming it. It's almost as if he was thinking, 'I need to show what happens during the following encounters: Thor vs. Captain America, Thor vs. Iron Man, Iron Man vs. Loki', etc., and then later on, many combinations of two or three of the Avengers fighting bad guys together, to contrast their earlier conflicts. I appreciate the contrast that went into that aspect, but it just felt plain robotic the way it was executed. The thought pattern I detected was, 'You damn well can't have an Avengers movie without this happening, and this, and...' The result of this is that this 'quota' took the focus and actually enticing filmmaking was put on the backburner. He was simply showing things happening with entirely no flair or style of direction whatsoever. Oh look, here's Iron Man coming in to save the day! He's going to say something funny, don't we know it! Nothing stylish, unexpected or cinematic happens in this entire film. It left a dry taste in my mouth, despite all the cool effects and fighting.The story, along with the direction, was very milquetoast and forgettable. To briefly summarize: Loki, an alien, comes down to Earth to wreak havoc; the Avengers team up and stop him and all the aliens he summons through a giant portal as well. You'd think Nick Fury, being the leader of the Avengers, would take on a more interesting storyline role, but he really doesn't. I was maniacally uninterested in every single scene with him talking to the heads of S.H.I.E.L.D., and beyond that his storyline doesn't really go many places in this film. In fact all the other individual character storylines didn't really go anywhere either, which is okay since this film was a group effort, but the overall group storyline was not very interesting either, basically another rendition of saving the planet. Therefore neither the overarching group storyline nor the individual storylines were very fulfilling, leaving the story as a whole lacking.The script was also extremely dry and poorly written. I feel this was another item that went on the backburner to give the aforementioned 'quota' more focus. Most of the lines were very uninteresting and without character. One example that stuck out in my mind is Nick Fury saying, 'I'll bet you $10 you're wrong'. People may say this phrase in reality; it's not the realism about it I attack but the character and flair of it. This is a movie; when characters speak they should be saying things that are somewhat relevant, interesting, mysterious, gripping, funny, or any combination thereof. Something that delivers, something with edge or character. Most of the lines in the entire film I have completely forgotten already except ones like the above that I remembered just to point out how uninteresting they are. Just like with the direction, I felt as if the script, too, just had people saying things to move the story along. Very sparsely was any extra style or flair or character added in.Last but entirely not least is the acting, and overall I was disappointed. I'll start with the good: Robert Downey Jr. was his usual funny smartass self, and I have no complaints, nor was he exceptional. I also actually quite enjoyed Chris Evans as Captain America; I find him a talented actor who works well in various kinds of films. Also Scarlett Johansson did a great job as usual. I love Stellan Skarsg√•rd; he's a great actor, but I have to admit his placement in the film felt awkward and every time he came on screen I chose to express it through hysterical laughter. Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as Nick Fury but I wasn't very impressed, but I blame that on the script. Now for the bad: The main villain of the film, Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, was a terrible choice for the main villain of any film. I mostly laughed at his scenes, because of how bad his acting was, when laughter was unintended. The guy who plays Thor, Chris Hemsworth, was not very good either in this film. Also Mark Ruffalo was a disappointment to see. I don't mind his acting normally but it was just so noticeably inferior to Edward Norton's Hulk that it has to count as a negative.To sum up, good pacing, special effects and some interesting encounters between certain characters do not save a film when it has weak direction, a weak script, a weak storyline, mostly weak acting, and most glaring of all it seemed very cold, calculated, and without style. However, I was at least mildly entertained.",4,2,3,29 August 2018
Interstellar," Stellar only in theme, not in quality
","This is not going to be a scientific analysis/nitpick-fest of the film. Many things didn't make any astronomical sense, but I can usually forgive these errors (so long as they're not terrifically dense) if a film has good content, emotional impact, or any of the various qualities that make great films great films. This film, unfortunately, did not deliver very many qualities of good film making.As a veteran viewer of Christopher Nolan's films, I wish to open up with his weakest writing ability: characters. The only character that stands out among all of his films is the Joker in The Dark Knight, and that was mostly due to the brilliance of Heath Ledger's acting. Every single one of his characters (besides the Joker) is bland, stale, unexciting, unlikable, unrelatable, and simply banal. There is no lack of character change in his films, as there are certainly events/epiphanies/catharses that cause change in the characters, but the characters themselves, both before and after change, are just not interesting and lack depth. Change alone does not make a character more interesting or notable; there's also what they were before and what they become after to take into consideration. Interstellar is no exception; the characters are fairly one-dimensional. To be specific, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is the typical headstrong, confident, amiable guy, a protagonist type. His daughter Murphy is the average 'lovable cute' daughter with that special 'connection' with her father that ends up more or less being what saves the world by the end of the film. Anne Hathaway's character Dr. Brand had a lost love on another planet but other than that didn't offer much to the film.Perhaps a big part of why the characters are not so great is that there is almost always an oversaturation of characters in Nolan's films, so each one doesn't have a lot of time to be developed. Nolan loves to sprinkle in tons of big/medium name actors for near-useless roles, or very small ones. This film is once again no exception; what was the justification or purpose of Casey Affleck's character as Murphy's brother? That was a completely useless throwaway character. Even John Lithgow's character as the grandfather was pretty much unnecessary. And how about Topher Grace's character? Wes Bentley's? Even David Oyelowo's character, beyond helping out with gravitational research, offered very little to the film. There are simply too many small characters, it's hard to even remember them at all, let alone justify their presence in the film whatsoever. Inception suffered from this as well; I personally haven't seen that film since it first came out, and by now I can't even tell you any characters, or what their purpose might have been, beyond Leonardo DiCaprio's and Ellen Page's. I know many of the actors in the film but forgot their characters.It is not necessarily impossible to make a great film without a presence of good characters, but other areas must shine to make up for this lacking. There was plenty of dialog between the characters in this film, but most of it was a vehicle for explaining what was happening in terms of the scientific/relative time aspects. I feel that Inception was the same exact way in this regard; most of the film was spent tiresomely explaining itself, instead of just letting it play out and allowing the viewer to piece it together. Most films that explore sci-fi concepts that are a bit more difficult to follow than the average film, such as The Matrix, Vanilla Sky, and Minority Report, do so without sacrificing over half the film explaining what's happening. These films leave that explanation to a few key scenes, and let the viewer figure out the rest, even if it requires multiple viewings to fully absorb. This time spent explaining the scientific phenomena is precious film time wasted that would have been better spent on advancing the story, developing characters, build-up, or anything valuable as far as film substance. I can appreciate and understand that the film's concepts may be a bit much to swallow for the average viewer, but when a film's runtime ends up being 2 hours and 49 minutes because it needed to explain itself so vastly, this often indicates that there is something severely wrong with either the underlying story or the script, or perhaps both. Is it really worth all that extra time and sacrifice of film substance just to get across what is happening onscreen? Even if it makes the film slightly less accessible, I argue no. Not only that but it's a pretty darn boring way of going about it; the characters are just back-and-forth discussing their plans for most of the entire film. Surely there could have been more interesting ways using the language of cinema to communicate even these complex ideas. To the film's credit, Cooper did once use a whiteboard to diagram part of their plans; little touches like this were much needed in the other areas of the film.Even the dialog that was not self-explaining was rather dull. One of the lines was something like: 'I thought I could watch you suffer and die but I just can't do it'. Why was that even in the film? Why not use cinematography to show his head look away, silently portraying that he can't watch it? The writing in general was just not good, there are plenty more exemplifications than just this.Were the story and overall ideas conveyed enough to outshine the rest of the film's lacking? Unfortunately not. The film begins in a typical modernist viewpoint of a near-future apocalyptic scenario; humans destroyed the planet and need to be offloaded onto another. Most of the film is about exploration and the journeying to find a suitable planet, while possible chaos and total destruction of all humans on earth was at hand. Time travel, fifth-dimensional, and black hole theory were sprinkled in a bit too. The premise and concepts are certainly interesting enough in themselves, but they just weren't used well at all and meshed together rather awkwardly. The scene inside the black hole was trying to be super thought-provoking and 'out there' and 2001: A Space Odyssey-like but it fell pretty flat. The visuals were fairly interesting but it felt more like a thrown-in aside than an attempt to say anything useful. The only thing I personally gathered from it was that human technology could perhaps one day advance to the fifth dimension. This, sadly, offered nothing for the film itself, and only provided a brief marveling about future technology. To contrast, 2001 was all about these ideas, and the genius of Arthur C. Clarke spoke volumes about galactic travel and technology.The overall message of the film was fairly cheesy; the human idea of 'love' somehow transcends all physical laws and stands as the One True Concept of our universe, or at least the one that outshines the rest. I could see this idea working but it wasn't portrayed well at all. In fact this message was even outright told to the viewer by the protagonist; once again where is the subtlety here? Certainly the average viewer can gather at least that much.Interstellar was, however, not completely terrible in every way. Hans Zimmer's work on the score was fairly fitting, epic and had a slow, drawn out feel as the film did. The acting was pretty good all around. Of course, I wish the characters were better to make room for better acting, but good performances were delivered for what the characters were. Many of the effects, especially the incessant spinning of the various spacecraft, were fairly well-done and immersive.Finally, to end on the film's best element, the human impact of time relativity on a real person is something that is not explored much even in most sci-fi films. When Cooper sees his children all grown up and learns that his father has died after spending only a few hours on an extragalactic planet, he weeps uncontrollably. This is something that audiences can relate to; this is good film content. This aspect I'd like to see explored more in future films, and perhaps Interstellar shall be popular enough to make an impact within film studios toward this direction, hopefully with better writing and direction in future endeavors.",3,0,2,1 September 2018
The Bourne Ultimatum," I believe that it takes a certain level of genius to depict a genius character
","I believe that it takes a certain level of genius to depict a genius character showing how intelligent he or she is. It's one thing to declare a character as 'genius', as many stories do, without it ever being shown in his or her actions or words (beyond cheaply throwing in the occasional 'big words'). But it's a whole 'nother when the intelligence of the character is plainly visible in front of your eyes.Much of the credit for this goes to Robert Ludlum, the author of the Bourne novels, for creating the character and the story in the first place. After coming up with the scenario and overall theme, Ludlum had to ask, at every single corner of the story, 'What would this genius do next?' He had to become and think exactly like the character Bourne, who is very intelligent. It takes intelligence and creativity to get in the mind of an intelligent character like that.In fact most of the characters in the entire film are pretty smart, and convincingly so. This is a tough thing to achieve in the film world; when it's done poorly, it's fairly transparent and the character just doesn't seem bright even though he or she is depicted as such. It's the lack of intelligent writing (and perhaps acting) that makes you feel that they just aren't what they're portrayed to be.This is why Tony Gilroy, the screen story writer, gets a large portion of the credit as well. He has displayed that he knows which bits work better just left to the book and which were translatable into film, and carefully sewed together a modified version of the story that just works better in a film context than the book's would have.I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of Paul Greengrass's directing style as a whole; the intentionally shaky camera can feel a bit gimmicky and sometimes even amateur. But I also must say that he was a smart choice for director of this particular film. The style fits the fast pacing and there's something about the very raw, quick feel about it that works well. The cuts give you the sense that there's no time for breathing room, because there basically isn't. Bourne has a mission and can't waste a single second. It never really gets slow or boring; it constantly grips your attention.One very subtle thing I love in this film is the extremely unspoken romance between Bourne and Nikki Parsons, played by Julia Stiles. Fitting with their personalities and jobs, they both don't reveal a single word of it but you can just feel it's there, especially when Stiles delivers the line 'With you, it was ... difficult...' You know what she really is saying there, but they never reveal anything directly beyond that.To top all of it off, the film offers some of the slickest fighting in the past decade. Excellent choreography and once again just plain intelligent, not just on Bourne's end but also his opponent's. He is, of course, going up against some of the most highly-trained killers alive, so naturally they have a different kind of smarts about them, combat.This film just plain and simple delivers intelligence in almost every arena: story, writing, acting, characters, choice of director, fighting, and certainly plenty of CIA 'intelligence'. All the qualities that make the Bourne trilogy great it does the best. Best movie of the trilogy.",9,1,2,29 August 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Self-parody, but not funny nor original
","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for 'comedy' is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a 'lighter' feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for 'comedy' is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing 'modern Marvel movies' as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were 'just there'. No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into 'one united Avengers' character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.",2,4,6,3 July 2019
Room," Powerful premise, but disappointing execution
","This film's premise is soul-crushingly powerful. Hearing about the similar real-life cases in Austria like Natascha Kampusch and Josef Fritzl was incredibly devastating, and honestly even quite hard to believe. If events like this didn't indeed happen in reality, the film would arguably be labelled as 'absurdly unbelievable'. But shockingly this does have a very real backing. The writer's decision to keep this fictional was respectable; truly basing this on a real story or person would not be very tactful and may come off as trivializing the trauma of the victims.There is much gained from the premise alone, especially one as relatively unexplored as this one is. However, executionally there were so many problems that the premise shines as all this film really has. As powerful as it may be, it cannot save poor acting, narrative, direction, and even story. In fact, these elements even mitigated the brutal power that stems from the premise.The mom played by Brie Larson is the key actress we see the most in the entire movie, and unfortunately her acting was awful enough that it was tough to actually bear any semblance of sympathy for her character. Her crying was not believable, and that's an important one to get right for this kind of role. Otherwise she mostly came off as just annoying. The kid was mostly annoying and very spoiled too. Perhaps this was somewhat intentional: after being trapped for 7 years, one is not exactly going to be a testament to human behavior, especially not a child. But it did make it tough to garner any true sympathy for the characters. The actors who did a great job in this film were the female police officer and all 3 grandparents (including the creepy stepdad), but they weren't major enough to make much of an impact.Without sympathy as a forefront, it begs the question: What is the narrative of this film? Emma Donoghue seemed to just hang back and portray some snippets out of Jack's life, all without cohesion, relying purely on the premise alone to carry the narrative. The beginning setup and up until breaking out of the room was clear enough, but everything that happens after is very muddy. Why are we seeing the aftermath, the grandparents, the TV interview, the newfound daily life of the child? It's clear that Donoghue wished to show all the complicated facets of this situation, both during and after. But this conflicts with the character's perspective whose eyes we're seeing the film through, namely the child. We should be seeing an interesting perspective on the outside world, and how everything is brand new to him now. We get only a small sliver of that, when he's looking at the sky while in the truck. After that, all that the latter half of the film really boils down to, without proper narrative, is just pointless melodrama and immature conflict shown for zero reason. What is actually compelling or interesting about any of this from the child's eyes?The first half of the story was decent enough except for one very unbelievable part: why would the guy not check if the child was really dead? It would have been very simple for him to do. It is really tough to believe that he successfully didn't fall for any of her tricks for 7 long years and now proved stupid enough to fall for this. It is possible that she played a masterfully long game and simply never tried any tricks up until that, so he wouldn't have any reason to suspect her of trickery. But this was not shown or built up, as we enter the film 7 years in already. Hence, regardless of the hypothetical believability of the situation, what is displayed or presented to us as a cinema viewer comes off as strange and not believable.Overall this was a disappointment. A premise as strong as this one has sadly been ruined by just plain bad filmmaking.",4,2,5,12 July 2019
Kick-Ass," Just another superhero movie
","Oh, excellent, a foray into superheroes once again, but this time let's give it a comedic spin. Also let's keep it 'realistic' and ACKNOWLEDGE the fact that superheroes are a ridiculous idea. That will make it original.Except it just makes it another frickin' superhero movie at the end of the day.The movie is about a teenage boy so obsessed with comic books and superheroes that he simply tries to become one by donning a costume, dubbing himself 'Kick-Ass', and trying to fight bad guys on the street. The angle it tried to go for from this initial setup was to show how a 'real' superhero attempt would go down. It mildly succeeds in the beginning, showing our protagonist getting his ass kicked when trying to be a hero. I was hoping it would continue with this angle, but I just knew it wouldn't. Eventually it degrades into your average superhero flick when 'real' superheroes (Nic Cage and his character's daughter) come in to save Kick-Ass. There's nothing actually supernatural about these 'real' superheroes, just an unrealistic amount of fighting skill.It is precisely at this point, about 40 minutes in, that the film flushes away all potential. It was literally set up, and marketed, as a real attempt at being a superhero and to show how bad of an idea the whole thing is, all with a comedic spin. This may have actually worked, but instead there ARE actual superheroes who waste insane amounts of baddies and do things superheroes generally do. I believe there was plenty of comedic potential in the initial premise, but the inclusion of these 'actual superheroes' literally defeats the entire purpose of the film. It made me ask myself: What the hell am I now watching? Perhaps this was done intentionally, comedically, like 'we are a comic book movie so we ultimately have to be a comic book movie', but then that just begs the question: Why not just be a comic book movie? Why even include this whole beginning with the 'reality behind superheroes and why there are none in real life' angle? The only thing I can come up with is fresh marketability. But it certainly did not lead to fresh filmmaking or content. Also for this kind of movie it was way too long, clocking in at a full 2 hours.Despite the film's lack of any good substance, it still gives a few laughs, mostly on the behalf of Nicolas Cage's intentional overacting. Also the intro was quite funny in a tasteless fashion: it showed a kid with a superhero costume and cape jumping off a tall building, expecting to fly, but instead just landing to his death on a taxi cab.But overall, other than a few cheap laughs and some decent fighting, this was not a very good film and doesn't really stand out as anything original despite the potential it may have had in the beginning. I merely pray they don't make a sequel, but I have a strong feeling they will due to the way it ended.",4,2,3,29 August 2018
The Martian," Ridley Scott has not crafted a good film in years
","Ridley Scott has not crafted a good film in years. This latest installment is unfortunately no exception to this pattern.Taking a broader perspective on Scott's career as a director, one can easily see that he loves to depict a humble protagonist, one who displays nobility of heart, stands up for his/her beliefs and has a moral struggle but tends to choose the 'right path' even if it is the harder one. I do not mean to say that path is necessarily morally sound from a viewer's perspective, or even from Scott's perspective, but instead it is 'right' for that character and what they believe is right. Scott is quite practiced at this kind of character, as he's done it in several films: American Gangster, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Gladiator, Robin Hood, Body of Lies, and Kingdom of Heaven, to name a few.In this film, The Martian, Scott attempts to break away from this formula a little bit. We are still centered around one main protagonist who is struggling, but not morally - instead, for his own survival. There's no hard choice to make, no pros and cons to weigh; he is simply fighting for his survival and has to face the reality that he may not get out of it at all and end up dead on Mars.At first I was relieved that finally Scott is trying something else, as his last several films have been formulaic and tiresome. I was even looking forward a bit to seeing what he would do with such a film. But this film brings almost nothing to the table, almost entirely devoid of substance. It is as if the tried and true formula Ridley Scott is known for is actually all he is capable of as a director. I don't mean to say he should never do anything else, because certainly that formula is getting very tiring. I just mean that it says something disconcerting about his directing when his precious formula is taken away and this is the result: a large forgettable black hole of a film.The struggle of survival is a theme tackled by many films, and I do not attack this film thematically. The theme indeed has the potential to deliver something very powerful, emotional, gripping, something that jibes with the human experience as a whole, something that, even if we cannot relate to directly, we can feel for the character going through it. 127 Hours is a great example of a survival story which was done well. We feel the brutality of the situation; he is broken down to the point of drinking his own urine and eventually his spirit breaks down enough to the point of severing his own limb off. Things actually happen that show the character's suffering, brutal things that justify the extreme action taken.Nothing really happens in this film. The plot is virtually null, and the emotional content is non-existent as well. One would expect a survival story to actually contain a bit of struggle, perhaps even some brutality or exploration of extreme states of the human condition, but this films lacks all of those. Almost right away, since he just so conveniently happens to be a botanist, he figures out a way to grow food, and you fully trusted he would do so given his profession. As for water, there is plenty aboard the station. As a viewer, your comfort level in his biological state is very high; he has plenty of food and water to last him quite a while. So that's taken care of promptly. Secondly, the social factor. Loneliness of that scale can be a powerful cinematic element.to take advantage of, but this is also ruined by the film constantly cutting back to Earth, and then he finds a way to start contacting Earth also. So that is also taken care of. Thirdly, missing his friends and family. That just wasn't ever brought up even one time, so that wasn't taken care of so much as it was entirely absent. All this together shows basically zero struggle. Somehow Scott has managed to make a survival story into a cushy, comfortable ride; I never once doubted or was afraid for his life. I don't state this with revere, this kind of contrast is simply baffling and doesn't make sense whatsoever. There were a few occasions where the film tried to throw in a sense of looming doom, like the food supply would reduce or the situation back on Earth would seem hopeless, but these ultimately felt contrived and were tossed in purely superficially; it definitely didn't fool me any.Right in line with the empty plot, character development is also nil. Our protagonist learns nothing, does not change in any fundamental way, nor does any supporting character. He gets left behind on Mars and gets rescued at the end, going back to normal life afterward. Oh, he starts to teach survivalism in extreme space situations, but this is more of an afterthought than a fundamental character change. Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA; he honestly could've been completely cut out of the film and no significant difference/loss would've occurred. His role was to be the face to the public, as we constantly see him babbling on and on in press conferences about Damon's current state and what NASA is doing to try to rescue him. In fact, most of the scenes and characters on Earth felt pretty pointless. To some level they were obviously needed, as they are the ones who must rescue him, but that didn't make them enjoyable (not that the Mars scenes were much better).I'm not entirely sure how much can be blamed on the novel the film is based on, as I have not read it, but I do believe a director has full control of a film and if a novel is a bit drab, a director can and should breathe more life into it. I have a hunch the novel is not so bad and it is just that Ridley Scott was assuredly the wrong choice for its adaptation into film. It also might seem appropriate to blame the script writer, Drew Goddard, but the dialogue was not so horrible, aside from the mostly banal attempts at humor - though some lines were funny. While I do not ignore the significant role that source novel material and screenplay have, I'm still placing most responsibility onto Scott's lap. He didn't portray any character change, he didn't use a cinematic eye to communicate any substance.As far as acting goes, nothing is particularly terrible, but not much was required either. As a counterexample, Damon's acting in Interstellar was one of the worst performances to ever appear in motion picture history, but this was because it tried to be a very dramatic scene where he attempts to murder the whole crew. His acting simply wasn't good enough to carry that kind of role, so it came off as simply laughable. This film on the other hand doesn't call for much, so his caliber of acting was just fine for it.All this said, there is one thing Scott shines at that I cannot deny, and it is present here also. He makes watchable films. It's hard to describe precisely what this means, but I'll try. It means a film that is entertaining enough, moves along quickly enough, is not completely laughably awful in every way, never gets too slow or boring - I should point out that this is completely different than a film having substance, which I've already said this film lacks. But it is watchable, I'll give it that. Entertaining enough in a popcorn sense - you don't need to pay attention much, because there's really nothing to pay attention to. This makes it more of a lighter affair, which completely contradicts its theme as I've already pointed out. So yes, I admit The Martian is not entirely boring as you're watching it, but after you watch it, there's nothing much to reflect on or take home.",4,3,4,29 August 2018
