Captain Phillips," decent film, hanks at his best
","I'm not a huge hanks fan i do like him in some films but in this he was terrific,especially the last half hour or so. It is so far the best film i have seen from 2013. Taken the material it folds out like a thriller and a drama - a very unflinching and tense one.Hanks plays Rich Phillips captain of a cargo ship delivering food to poor countries in Africa. But the pirates were after money and lots of it! Overall i give this film 8 and hope Hanks gets a nod for an Oscar maybe, unless i see a better performance from 2013.Worse things happen at sea so the saying goes and this is a confirmation on how scary out at sea can be especially in pirate waters. Bandit land. The Somalians were the ultimate villains and played their parts just as convincingly as Hanks did.",8,1,2,11 February 2014
12 Years a Slave," underwhelmed and left wanting more
",When i hear 'masterpieces' and greatest film made quotes i instantly want to turn off. But i was intrigued. I remember when people were whistling Dixie over inception and that i gave 4 out of 10. So i carried my sorry ass to the cinema with trepidation and no expectation.Now slavery and the slave trade is sickening and wrong and we all know that but this film had the material to make a good story but it failed as a drama and mood piece and lacked emotional punch. Seriously i went away so disappointed because it could of been better. Why did i feel this way?. I wasn't convinced by the performances and the material. I hated the script and i didn't feel sad one bit. Therefore i must take from it that i am a cold hearted bastard! It was merely a decent film and i much preferred Django Unchained. But not one of the greatest films ever made and far from a masterpiece.,7,0,2,11 February 2014
