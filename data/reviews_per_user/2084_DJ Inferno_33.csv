The Blair Witch Project," Just another campfire tale...
","2644 comments (as of September 22nd) and now here comes mine...'The Blair Witch Project' is not the greatest horror movie of all times, it´s not the greatest shocker of the last decade, not even the best one of 1999! The idea is neither new nor revolutionary in any way, because nearly the whole plot is a 1:1-copy from Ruggero Deodato´s exploitation classic 'Cannibal Holocaust' as well as the style is taken from Danish Dogma-movies like 'Festen' or 'Idioterne'! The most interesting fact about BWP is the skilled propaganda how this movie was advertised via Internet as a real documentary about three missing students. Parodies like 'The Bare Wench Projekt' or 'The Tony Blair Witch Project' followed. How about another starring Leslie Nielsen?!?However there are also some good words to say, because I liked the mood of hopelessness, fear and desperation that is transmitted by this film. 'The Blair Witch Project' is worth one look, but finally it is also one of the most overhyped movies ever made!4/10P.S.: I would be thankful if anyone could tell me where I can buy storage batteries which last for more than 72 hours...",Null,0,1,22 September 2001
Fight Club," Sweet as the punch
","It is always said, that the 90s were 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Trainspotting',but in my opinion 'Fight Club' is the most important film of the last decade (nevertheless, the two others are brilliant movies,too!). 'Fight Club' shows in a forceful way, how life becomes existence and existence becomes meaningless, because of the total lost of the own identity. We praise television and advertising, money is our god, but we become more and more faceless beings. In the case of the narrator (Edward Norton) it leads to a split personality, schizophrenia, and the result of that is Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). A charismatic and dangerous anarchist. Together (although they are one and the same person!) they establish the fight club. And in this unity all these shattered existences get what them makes feel that they are real: Pain! It´s the best therapy that they can´t get anywhere else. After a while, Tyler plans the total overrun of society. And the narrator finds himself trapped in the net of his own conspiracy... What can I say more about this movie: David Fincher´s direction is excellent (although the film has got some length, but who really cares?!?), the score of the 'Dust Brothers' is also great, camera handling and atmosphere are a fabulous mixture between video clip and film noir. Brad Pitt, who is still too underrated as an actor, is the stated star in this movie, but Edward Norton´s performance had deserved an oscar! (10/10)",Null,0,1,19 January 2001
Blade," Funny action trash, Gothic atmosphere
","'Blade' is a filmed comic strip in perfection. Every second you await that balloons come out of the mouths of the characters. The splatter FX look like if they were drawn. This movie is very gory and violent, but everything is so exaggerated, that you won´t find it disgusting. It has a subtle sense for dry and dark humour. Perhaps this shot is one of the best comic adaptations ever, because it doesn´t take itself too serious and tries not to be anything, that it won´t be. Also you can find elements of the blaxploitation movies from the 70s, mixed with a Gothic atmosphere and an up to date soundtrack. Wesley Snipes as 'Blade' is one of the coolest action heroes ever and Stephen Dorff gives a nice performance as bad guy 'Deacon Frost'. There is also a large number of worth seeing supporting actors like Kris Kristoffersen, N´Bushe Wright, Donal Logue or Udo Kier. As I said, don´t take this movie too serious and you won´t bore a second! And - yes!!! - watch out for 'Blade 2:Bloodlust'..! (7.5/10)",Null,0,1,20 January 2001
Chicken Run," Like a Hollywood movie
","What film must it be, that can make you laughing and amazing in one and the same way? 'Chicken run' is a perfect parody on Hollywood´s popcorn movies and old war dramas, but it has got the same suspense and excitement as them. The best scene is when Ginger and Rocky are inside the pie machine. This sequence has an unbelievable thrill that even a 100$-movie couldn´t give you... The animators did a great job! It´s  good to know, that you don´t always need computers and expensive high tech stuff to make good FX - just use plasticine! (9.5/10)",Null,0,0,5 December 2000
X-Men," What´s so good about this film?
","First I must say that I have never read an 'X-Men' comic, so my critics refer only on the film...At the beginning, the entrance sequence in the concentration camp, I though I was in 'Schindler´s List', but not in a Sci-fi movie and I waited in vain for an explanation for that phenomenon. And there are some more problems that ran through the whole film: 'X-Men' is no typical popcorn movie, because the suspense is too low, there is too less action and there were better special F/X in other films. It is also no final speech for more tolerance towards minorities, because this aspect stays surface, and although there is always the talk about war between humans and mutations the plot stays empty. And finally, this film takes itself much to serious: there are no jokes, no gags, no sense for dark humor as we have seen it in 'Blade', for example. And then the so-called GREAT cast... Well, the actors do a solid job, but great..? Patrick Steward performing the leader of the bunch is nothing else but playing Captain Picard in a wheelchair. Ian McKellen is a great actor, that´s right. But if you wanna see great performances watch his other films! I don´t know why Halle Berry stays in the background with her role and otherwise why Wolverine´s part is so important, although Hugh Jackman is a much better actor then Russell Crowe! From the rest of the cast - Famke Jansen, James Mardsen, Anna Paquin... - you get the usual quality you would expect, but none of them has deserved an Oscar for their roles!Now, there are also some good points about 'X-Men': it´s very difficult to make good comic adaptations without compromising yourself to much and being ridiculous. Director Bryan Singer has definitely made one of the better comic adaptations, although this film is still too overrated in my opinion. (6/10)",6,0,0,31 March 2001
Snatch," Highly recommended!
","Simply one of the best comedies seen in the last few years! The gags will keep you laughing for days and Brad Pitt, who talks with an unbearable speech defect gives a brilliant self parody on his Tyler Durden part in 'Fight Club'. But itÂ´s also very seldom that main actors and supporting actors are playing their roles so brilliant in one and the same way like here: Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, the squeaking pitbull... only to name some of a good few. 'Snatch' itself appears, as if Guy Ritchie had crossed 'Trainspotting' with 'Pulp Fiction' - British humor meets American coolness. There are a lot of curious and original ideas, which had been enough for three further films and the whole movie has the speed of a fast train. Love it or leave it! (9/10)",Null,0,0,23 March 2001
Taxi Driver," An urban nightmare!
","Is Travis Bickle the Tyler Durden of the 1970s?!? Saw Scorcese´s urban masterpiece some years ago, re-watched it today and just realized how many parallels it has to David Fincher´s 'Fight Club': in both flicks two men, who are fed up with their existence and suffer from Insomnia, decide to clean society in their own way. Both become more and more radical, change their looks and start their own crusade against the existing conditions. However, as Tyler Durden sets up a force in his house, Travis Bickle becomes a one-man-army who frees a prostitute under age with gun power at the end...This big city-fairy tale is one of the most disturbing, but also fascinating character-studies! Great Robert de Niro plays the role of the fanatic insane with an almost frightening intensity and he rules the whole film with his powerful performance! Although there are lots of great actors in the supporting roles like Jodie Foster as young prostitute, Harvey Keitel as her pimp Sport or Cybil Shepherd as Bickles unhappy love affair they all stay plain in comparison to the great lead!! However, the secret star of 'Taxi Driver' is the city of New York itself with its neon lights, its porn cinemas, its dark backyards and its muddy charm! This way director Martin Scorsese has created an homage to the big apple as well as a fascinating and metaphoric trip into the human soul!!",Null,0,0,11 January 2002
Fargo," The prototype of an excellent thriller!
","At the beginning this film reminded me on Sam Raimi´s 'A Simple Plan' which I had seen before and which is also worthy to watch, but very soon 'Fargo' develops its very own style. The story is about a quite harmless conspiracy that ends in a total disaster. All happens in a small dump called 'Fargo', that is snowy and idyllic, where you couldn´t expect anything evil. But the Coen Brothers take a look behind the facade, a view into the depths of the human soul. It all starts with a kidnapping action that finally leads to five senseless murders. It´s a film about cheating, betraying and killing. At last you´ve got the unpleasent feeling that something could be wrong with your own neighbour...  This movie is a brilliant mixture between thriller, drama and satire. There are some macabre/funny scenes in it (when Gear 'disposes' his companion Carl) and a lot of peculiar characters, what is usual for the outputs of Joel and Ethan (watch also 'The Big Lebowski' and you know what I mean...). Of course, 'Fargo' is casted with the obligatory Coen-staff, that contains Joel´s wife Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi who´s stealing the other ones show. Perhaps some people might find this movie dull: 'Fargo' is no film with big talk and 10000 dead per minute... You have to pay attention on the subtle humour and the little subtleties in it. Take this advice - and enjoy 'Fargo'! (9/10)",Null,0,0,29 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not a movie - an event!
","As a huge fan of Peter Jackson´s first three movies 'Bad Taste', 'Meet the Feebles' and 'Braindead/Dead Alive' I was more than sceptical when I went to the cinema to see this pretty hyped film! And indeed, the first 30 minutes where pure camp, so it seemed that Jackson would be after John Woo the next former cult director who sold his soul to the commerce of Hollywood. But fortunately, the film became better with every minute then, and finally we had a really breathtaking and spectacular masterpiece on the screen! The most important thing about LOTR is the fact, that it´s no soulless material battle like 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbour'. Although the CGI-effects were really excellent, the set decoration is bombastic and every cent is visible, Peter Jackson´s film is a movie that lives from his sympathetic actors! Especially I liked the performances of Elijah Wood, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, John Rhys-Davis, the famous Shakespeare-actor Ian McKellen (is he already knighted to call himself 'Sir'?!?) and horror-legend Christopher Lee (another one to be knighted!). The director could call himself now the David Lean of fantasy movies and if not, he created at last a film that you really can call big cinema! George Lucas should see this gem to realize how bad 'The Phantom Menace' actually was, because Peter Jackson´s film will set new standards for the future of film-making, 'Episode 1' however was nothing else but a 120-minutes Playstation video-game! I only find it pretty exaggerated that so many users voted this film for being number one here on IMDb - just before masterpieces like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Casablanca'..! Nevertheless the greatest movie of the season, if you only gonna see one film this year it should be LOTR!!By the way, did anybody realize the goof where a car is driving over a hill far behind..?!?",Null,0,0,23 January 2002
American Psycho," Yuppiemania
","I haven´t read the book, so my critics refer only on the film. But I know Bret Easton Ellis further release 'Glamorama' which was quite enjoyable...'American Psycho' shows a gross picture of the yuppie society from the 80s which is defined by wearing designer clothes, f***ing the other one´s wife, surface twaddle, sniffling cocaine and being always in competition to the others concerning the career and the coolness. Beyond this facade however lies an empty and senseless world... To give his life some new impulses and to escape from this hopeless situation Patrick Bateman starts killing people, but he doesn´t get the hoped-for relief...Without transfering the excessive violence from the book Mary Harron´s film is less a thriller, it´s more a satire on a glamorous society where people loose more and more the relationship to normality and themselves. In the first place 'American Psycho' is worth watching because of his great main actor Christian Bale and the subtle, ironic and cynical dialogues. 'Fight Club' was the definite movie for the 90s and so is 'American Psycho' to express the glittering but empty way of life of the 80s. (9/10)",Null,1,2,30 April 2001
Dark City," Another outstanding Sci-Fi flick!
",Next to David Cronenberg´s 'eXistenZ' and Paul Verhoeven´s 'Starship Troopers' Alex Proyas 'Dark City' is one of the best Sci-Fi movies that was made in the last few years.

The Exorcist," Overrated somehow..!
","Last Sunday I saw this legendary horror classic (it was the cut version, not the directorÂ´s cut that I checked out..!) for the first time and it was something like a little disappointment to me, because William FriedkinÂ´s 'The Exorcist' was not that disturbing it ought to be..! No doubt, the atmosphere was creepy and the performances of Max von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Lee J. Cobb and especially Linda Blair in the role of her life time were all stunning, but the rest of the film was oddly empty and didnÂ´t come up to the founded expectations! This flick is okay for rainy Sundays like the last one was, however itÂ´s no classic or a cult movie in my eyes! Perhaps I should just watch the directorÂ´s cut...",Null,1,5,30 November 2001
Coyote Ugly," 'Showgirls' for children
","Yes, unbelievable, but I really liked this! First, when I saw the trailer, I thought this movie might be a kids version of Paul Verhoeven´s 'Showgirls', which belongs more to the sector of trash and satire. But finally 'Coyote Ugly' was an old-fashioned but pretty sometimes-dreams-come-true fairy tale. It would be better to make comparisons to the dance movie 'Flashdance', which was also produced by Jerry Bruckenheimer and tells the same story about a poor girl from the countryside/province/suburbia who wants to become rich and famous in New York... The chicks in 'Coyote Ugly' fulfill their jobs in looking great very excellent (especially Tyra Banks and Maria Bello), but I think none of the actresses will have their breakthrough with this one. The film itself is for being shady too harmless, for being a social study too surface, and for a comedy it´s not funny enough. It´s just one of those films, if you haven´t seen it you won´t miss anything. But if you do, you will be reveling in a pink bubble for two hours... (6/10)",Null,0,1,29 March 2001

The atmosphere is dark and ominous, main actor Sean Gullette is great in playing the leading role! Similar to the characters featured in the books of writer Franz Kafka main person Max is full of existential anxiety, sealed off from the world outside, living in his own cyberspace that consists of formulas and computers chips.

The Evil Dead," The first, the best!
","When I was a child and this film came out a lot of rumors were going around: that it was one of the goriest and sickest movies ever made and only the toughest guys had stick it out till the end. Nineteen years have passed and I´ve seen Raimi´s flick about 6 or 7 times. As you see, I have survived and 'The Evil Dead' now belongs to my favorite horror movies ever! This film is really sensational: realized with nearly no budget it became one of the most influential movies in the horror genre. Sam Raimi´s work is gory as hell, the make-up F/X are well done and the 'flying camera' and a lot of unusual camera angles make this flick being a unique masterpiece! This film was banned in Germany for a long time until an annoying cut version came on the market. Author Stephen King called 'The Evil Dead' one of the best shocking movies ever made and main actor Bruce Campbell became the greatest cult star of the modern horror genre. Together with director Sam Raimi he also filmed 'The Evil Dead II', which is a very enjoyable shocker, too, but after all more a remake to the original. 'Army of Darkness', which is the third part of the serial, really disappointed me - the original stays unrivaled, an immortal cult classic!!!",Null,0,1,16 July 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," The return of the B-movies!
","'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a great crossover between A- and B-movies, that only a genius like Quentin Tarantino could have made possible: there are great character actors (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis) next to Hollywood superstars like George Clooney, Salma Hayek or Tarantino himself. Not to forget the excavation of almost forgotten cult-,trash- and C-movie actors like Cheech Marin, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, John Saxon or Michael Parks. Of course, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is also the only serious horror film of the 90s, which gave this sickening genre some new impulses. While all those teenager flicks like 'The Faculty' (also directed by Robert Rodriguez) were only rip-offs from their elder examples, FDTD has enough originality to be a real classic! This movie is full of slime and gore, absurd ideas (holy water filled in condoms), although the showdown reminded me a little bit on Peter Jackson´s 'Braindead'. Instead you get a great performance from Salma Hayek, who is one of the most erotic women alive! Her dance is one of the most unforgettable moments ever featured in a horror film! Many people also find it idiotic to combine a gangster story with a splatter flick: well, you shouldn´t take this movie too serious, because 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is nothing else but a B-movie with A-list actors. It exists from his crazy ideas and the pure fun entertainment! (9/10)",Null,9,12,8 April 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Is this fiction?
","Anyone who hasn´t seen 'A Clockwork Orange' misses one of the greatest movies of all times. It´s almost a gap in your education if you don´t know Stanley Kubrick´s masterpiece. This film is like something you´ve never seen before. Made in a pop art style 'A Clockwork Orange' gives a strange and bizarre impression of the near future: criminals are not punished anymore, they will be healed by killing their violent instincts. In the case of Alex these people became victims themselves, exiles from society...that creates their own monsters and let´s them drop... It has got something of Darwinism, which says, that only the strong can survive. How could they, if them were taken all their abilities? Otherwise Alex is also a victim of his own destiny: he causes violence...and gets back what he deserves!Alex is played impressively by Malcolm McDowell, who had the role of his life with this. After this one he hadn´t made anything that could be compared with Kubrick´s film (I call it the Dennis-Hopper-Syndrome). He tried to repeat his success with films like 'Caligula', but... In the 90s his most important roles were playing the bad guys in a 'Star Trek'-movie and in the filming of the comic adaptation to 'Tank Girl'. It´s a pity that you can see this charismatic actor nowadays only in meaningless B- and C- movies and video premiers. Instead of that, let´s watch 'A Clockwork Orange' for one more time, an immortal classic, that everybody has to be seen! (10/10)",Null,0,0,1 February 2001
Reservoir Dogs," Brilliant, excellent, fabulous, unique... (Choose the words by yourselves!)
","Memorable dialogues (about the message of Madonna´s song 'Like A Virgin'), a puzzled plot and hitmen in black suits: every elements 'Pulp Fiction' succeeded with public and critics were already used before in Quentin Tarantino´s debut. Only the violence is more excessive: a cop´s ear gets cut off and Tim Roth is bleeding to death the whole film. Nevertheless 'Reservoir Dogs' is a unique masterpiece! It opened new dimensions to the film making of the 90s and everyone who thinks 'Pulp Fiction' is the ultimate cult movie (don´t get me wrong: I LOVE 'Pulp Fiction'!) should see this one... Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth are as great as ever and even an average actor like Michael Madsen had the role of his life with performing the sick psychopath Mr. Blonde. A great film, worthy to be watched again and again!

"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Like a cut into the flesh
","On the first sight Pasolini´s '120 Days of Sodom' seems to be nothing more but a film about sexual obsession and perversion. Actually deals with the explanation about the origin, the function and the aftermath of fascism, shown in a metaphoric way. You´ll need strong nerves and a strong stomach to hold it out to the end. Especially the 'dinner scene', were a very special meal gets served, will still pursue days later, although you can´t escape the stadium between repulsion and fascination for the whole film. The borders of pornography, violence and a political message have never been so close to each other as they were in this movie. Otherwise 'Salò' is an unequivocal final speech against every form of National Socialism and oppression. If your mind is of a conservative imagination of moral: Stay far away from this film! If you are open-minded to an explicit and extreme art of cinema: Try to see Pasolini´s masterpiece whenever you can!!!

Total Recall," Schwarzenegger on his zenith
","Anno 1991, when I was 16 years old, I saw 'Total Recall' for the first time and it was then the greatest film I had ever seen: Carolco was on the best way to become a further major studio with blockbusters like this one - long time before 'Titanic', Verhoeven´s movie was the most expensive film ever produced! The score composed by Jerry Goldsmith is still one of my favorites and Dan O´Bannon had done another brilliant job as script writer. The make-up and the special FX made by Rob Bottin were stunning (remember the female Marsian with THREE breasts or Cuato, the leader of the rebells...) and Paul Verhoeven became one of the most fascinating and provocative directors in Hollywood. There was a superior Arnold Schwarzenegger, a very sexy Sharon Stone, a tough Rachel Ticotin and a charismatic Michael Ironside playing the bad guy. All these facts make 'Total Recall' standing in one row with the best action movies of all times like 'Die Hard 1+2', 'The Rock', 'T2' or 'Face/Off'. Watch nowadays Schwarzenegger´s youngest releases like 'End of Days' or 'The 6th Day': they´re just solid action flicks, but nothing more. 'Total Recall' against it is a classic!

Pulp Fiction," C-U-L-T!!!!!!!
","What´s so special about 'Pulp Fiction'? There are dozens of ideas you´ve seen in other film before, the dialogues are trivial (about junk food, foot massages, serials on television...) and the plot is very confusing when you see this movie for the first time. The solution: 'Pulp Fiction' is a penny dreadful on celluloid. Same as other cult movies like 'A clockwork orange' or 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' you will get something, you´ve never seen before: a complete new style of film making! Tarantino´s masterpiece is full of strange types, striking conversations and scenes (especially Mia´s and Vincent´s dance, when Uma Thurman gets resuscitated...), a brilliant cast (John Travolta in the best role he ever played!), which would have been enough for five other films and a great soundtrack! At last it is also an homage about L.A., the city the director is living in. The whole story gets its thrill from the fact that the watcher has to combine all the different periods and places like a puzzle. A shame that 'Pulp Fiction' only got two academy awards, because it has all ingredients a real cult movie has got to have: the film was copied for a hundred times, especially in the 90s, big guns became a status symbol of the modern cinema. Watch it 9 or 10 times and you will always find something new! Cult as cult can!!! My IMDb rating: a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,1,2,25 February 2001

Main actor Anthony Perkins is giving an unforgettable over the top-performance! His role was so perfectly convincing that he was branded with the Norman Bates-image for his life time...Recently I wrote a review about Robert Wise´s all-time classic 'The haunting' and compared it to Jan de Bont´s terrible remake...

There´s no gore or explicit violence, but the suspense is murderous! One of those films that hold you in its grip from the first to the very last minute! I really enjoyed the great performances of actors like John Cassavetes, Maurice Evans, Ralph Bellamy or Ruth Gordon, but outstanding Mia Farrow has the role of her life time with playing the innocent victim! Sometimes her part reminded me on the one of Catherine Deneuve´s in Roman Polanski´s 'Repulsion', because both women suffer from urban fear, neurosis and an invisible danger.

I also liked 'Evil Dead II', but unfortunately something went wrong with this second sequel, cuz 'Army of Darkness' contains a humor that is not witty and jokes I can´t laugh about! It is neither frightening nor bizarre trash in any way..! The one and only positive thing I can tell about this film is, that the skeletons are an excellent homage to the great special F/X of the legendary Ray Harryhausen. The rest of 'Army of Darkness' however is dull and silly! Okay, Bridgette Fonda has a cameo appearance and Bruce Campbell is as great as usual, but if you wanna see real funny horror trash comedies check out Frank Henenlotter´s 'Basket Case' or 'Frankenhooker', as well as 'Mother´s Day' or Peter Jackson´s 'Bad Taste'.",Null,1,1,28 July 2001

Any Given Sunday," Touch down!
","Normally sports movies are not my cup of tea, but this one was very funny to watch. At the beginning my hopes about this film were not too high, because I awaited the usual story about a old man, who once was a great football champion, but now as a trainer he´s persecuted by failure and finally he gets ruined and dropped by the merciless business. But 'Any Given Sunday' was more a satire than a drama: in an ironic way it showed the madness of the All American Football Circus. Director Oliver Stone said about his own film: 'Baseball shows, what America wants to be; Football what it is..!'. Well, perhaps I´ve got to be an US-citizen to understand the message this movie wants to tell, because American football is not very widespread here in Germany, but the film itself was very entertaining (I recommend to everyone to watch the director´s cut with a total running time of 151 minutes!) and an ironic comment on the state of the American society. It is well-played by Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz, the cast of great supporting actors is nearly unbelievable (Woods, LL Cool J, Heston, Berkley, Holly, Stone himself...).

Trainspotting," Get your daily dose of 'Trainspotting'!!!
","Next to 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Fight Club' 'Trainspotting' is one of the definitely cult movies of the 90s! There is a great soundtrack (Iggy Pop, Blur, Underworld...) and there are some great actors, especially Robert Carlyle performing the choleric Francis Begbie. This film is not a conventional drama with the typical moral that sounds like 'Keep your hands away from drugs!', it is more a very grotesque comedy: 'Trainspotting' shows the everyday life of junkies in Scotland, but not in a dramatic or pitiful way. When Mark Renton and his friends shoot heroin, deal with drugs, become criminals or try to make their best wretched existence it seems to be so cool and funny that you won´t believe that they are social outsiders. This film shouldn´t be threaten as a social study, it is more a movie about the way of life of generation X.

Cube," Claustrophobic
","'Cube' is an interesting study about human behaviour in extreme situations. It´s less a horror film than a psychodrama about growing aggressions and escalating conflicts, about mistrust and desperation. On the other side it shows the iron will of five people trapped in a deadly labyrinth who only want to escape and survive. It seems if they were test subjects for a psychiatric experiment. The only pity is that you neither find out who build this giant complex nor why they are inside. At the end there is no solution for all that questions. You can use this film more as a visual instruction about the human nature than caring about the story or any logic. An other problem is, that the dialogues sound very unnatural and the acting is not very good. I give solid 7 points out of 10 for the original idea and the continuous suspense.",Null,0,1,11 February 2001
Jackie Brown," This one´s a winner!
","I´ve always been a huge fan of blaxploitation-queen Pam Grier and her stunning cult movies like 'Coffy', 'Foxy Brown' or 'Friday Foster', and I also love Quentin Tarantino and his cool gangsta films 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'! Now, both icons made a film together and my hopes were more than tremendous toward it, however I was quite disappointed when I saw 'Jackie Brown' for the first time about two years ago: there was too much talk and too much political correctness to be really enthusiastic! Jackie was neither tough nor sexy enough to be a second Foxy! But I was wrong: Tarantino´s film is brilliant actor drama with fantastic protagonists like Robert de Niro show Samuel L. Jackson and Bridget Fonda in the lead! However, the greatest thing is main actress Pam Grier herself: she has nothing lost of her sex appeal and is still one of the most gorgeous ladies on our planet! Her acting is great, she even steals Robert de Niro´s, but she didn´t use her chance for further appearances in better movies, what is quite incomprehensible to me! But also director and script writer Tarantino once more did a great job: loved the marvelous 1970s-soundtrack and the plot is as well-developed as in 'Pulp Fiction'! Some may call it a bore, I call it one of the best films of the last decade!!!",Null,1,2,7 April 2002
True Romance," Shotgun wedding
","Quentin Tarantino´s brilliant script made it possible that director Tony Scott, normally responsible for average Hollywood-stuff à la 'Crimson Tide' or 'Enemy of the State', filmed his best movie with this! A great photography and cinematography, curious parts like former sex symbol Brad Pitt as a hash smoker or Val Kilmer as Elvis Presley´s ghost and an excellent cast even in the smallest roles made 'True Romance' being another masterpiece by the God of 1990s-gangster movies!! Loved Dennis Hopper´s dialogue with Chris Walken and the following headshot as well as the riot showdown at the end (Tony Scott recycled the same idea in his Will Smith-vehicle some years later again..!); gorgeous Patricia Arquette is an absolute eyecandy in this modern Bonnie & Clyde-version! Unfortunately, 'Natural Born Killers', where Tarantino also wrote the script script, was not nearly as great as this one! A masterpiece of 1990s-cinema!!",Null,0,2,30 November 2001
Gladiator," Bombastic production, old-fashioned story
","It´s impossible to stay unimpressed from this gigantic epic. 'Gladiator' is full of dramatic, emotion and suspense. Watch this film on a big screen at the cinema and the sets, costumes and the sound will catapult you out of your seat! The cast is excellent - especially Joaquin Phoenix as schemer Roman emperor. However I was disappointed about the leading actor Russell Crowe, who was in my opinion too reserved for this role. The second problem is, that the story lies somewhere between 'Spartacus' (Gladiator fights against the Roman empire and becomes the hero of the nation) and 'Quo vadis?'. At last there is nothing really new in this film, it´s more a remake of the old ones - just with a better technic, better FX and a higher budget. Today I heard on the radio that 'Gladiator' is nominated for 12 awards... what made my think of that there are 'better' movies which also would deserve an Oscar. 'Better' in this sense that there films which have more original ideas and which are not only pure commercial products like this one is! However, you won´t be disappointed by 'Gladiator'. If you like bombastic cinema - watch this! It´s just a film that is made more for the eye than for the demands. (8/10)",Null,0,0,13 February 2001
Goodfellas," The rise and fall of Henry Hill
","For someone like me who hasn´t seen Francis Ford Coppola´s 'Godfather'-trilogy 'Goodfellas' is the ultimate movie about the mob! Scorsese´s work became so brilliant that repeated it with filming another outstanding flick called 'Casino'. And I´m quite sure that the Dean Martin-biography 'Dino', the next film Scorsese will be working on, has to be placed into the same category. Even Robert de Niro wandered in the footsteps of this great example with shooting his direction debut 'A Bronx Tale'. 'Goodfellas' is one of the definite highlights of all persons involved, even an actually average actor like Ray Liotta had the role of his life time with this. Watch that film for a great Robert de Niro, a great direction by Martin Scorsese, great supporting actors like Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco or Joe Pesci, a surprisingly good Ray Liotta and, of course, the catching story. Did I forget anything? God forbid! A masterpiece!!!

Evil Dead II," A one-man-show for Bruce Campbell
","Together with some friends I watched 'Evil Dead II' in our regular video night last weekend and we all decided, that this film is more a remake than a sequel: there are many parallels in the story according to the first part, but this flick was more devoted to main actor and Raimi´s friend Bruce Campbell, whose performance is main component of the film. The scene when he´s fighting against his right hand, and later shooting on it as it´s running away, is slapstick in the style of cartoons like 'Tom & Jerry'; but sometimes 'Evil Dead II' is also an homage on the creatures and the special F/X made by Ray Harryhausen (the headless body of Ash´s girlfriend for example... If you wanna see a real tribute on 'Jason and the Argonauts' watch 'Army of Darkness'!!!). The 'flying' camerawork is as excellent as in the first part, and when the whole hut (including the books, the lamp and the antlers) starts laughing about our would-be hero this film becomes a rapid drive through the ghost train.
