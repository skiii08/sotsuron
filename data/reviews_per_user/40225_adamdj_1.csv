Mission: Impossible III," Welcome back ACTION!
","There is only one word to describe MI3 and that is MEGA. After the brilliance of the first movie in this trilogy and the ridiculousness of the second, I had no idea what to expect. Let me tell you, this movie is huge. From the opening sequence to the thrilling finale you only have a few moments to catch your breath and this is the way action movies should be. For so long too much thought has been put into plots that drive the two to three action sequences in big Hollywood movies. Forget that. The action in MI3 drives the story and that is what makes this movie so fantastic to watch. There is no shortage of killing, no shortage of explosions, helicopters even jet fighters. The beauty of the way MI3 has been shot as opposed to something like The Bourne Identity is that while the action is very fast you can actually follow what's going on and that just heightens the intensity. While the plot is thin it holds the movie together just enough to keep this movie from becoming MI2. 9/10",9,6,12,3 May 2006
