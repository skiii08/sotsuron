The Ring," Nice suspense flick
","This is a nice suspense/horror movie, though the main interest is more in the 'detective' plot than the horror storyline, I found it quite interesting in that aspect.  There is a full set of clichÃ©s or hommages to earlier horror movies : obvious are The Shining (sequentially presenting the ongoing days with a doomlike gong sound, the aerial nature views, the horror flashes ), Poltergeist (of course, the TV), etc.  Even Psycho is winked a bit (stair scene, cabin guy seemingly weird, even a shower scene!).  Probably others also...  Anyay, fun stuff - well, sort of.",Null,0,0,12 April 2003
The Beach," I've seen worse
","I went to see this with my wife, we don't go to movies a lot together - kids and taste and all, but this was St-Valentine's. Let's go see Leonardo !Well the thing is not so bad, but it is definitely for an MTV audience. Some of the scenes are stunning and amazingly beautiful.  The first half is interesting enough, and makes you attentive to the story.  But then, it seems to be a mish mash of video-clips.  The Game Boy scene is kinda funny in the delirium part of the movie.  But the psychology of it all is pretty primitive, and could have been much better.All the 'drama' scenes seem to be picked up somewhere else.  I suppose the director was making a wink to Apocalypse Now at some point, if not, he really messed up that part of the story.  And the character development in the club-med-in-paradise environment could have been MUCH better.
It could have been a great movie, but I think they pushed hard to put Leonardo too much in front of everything.  Good acting, I must admit, but overshadowed by a movie that tries to be too much of everything at the same time : ecology, sociology, humanism, sex, vacation, action, ...  Too bad.",7,0,1,18 February 2000
Armageddon," 2001 it is not...
","Well, a friend told me to go see 'one of the best films he has ever seen'. Saw it 3 times, he said.  So this should be good, after all, he liked some of the stuff I liked.  He said he cried, even though he was a man, because the issues in this one are very human.Well,  my friend, cry as you may, but this is really a stupid flick.  Okay, it's entertaining, especially the 'pre-flight' part  of the movie - where comic relief is at it's best, I must admit (that JKF line - great!).  But honestly, from there on, the thing is pathetically juvenile.  They tried to make it a comic-strip movie, like Superman, and make us believe in it at the same time.  End result : really dumb.  And the 'emotional charge' is lame and easy.You know, some movies you go see with a specific mindset : we are perfectly aware that with this kind of movie, you have to put your good-taste button to zero to appreciate it .  Usually, you get out of these with a big smile in your face if you are ready to get in the game.But for Armageddon, unfortunately, there is no number under zero on the dial, so that's just asking for too much on my part.",4,0,1,10 January 2000
U-571," Okay
","Hollywood has the recipe for a sub movie; here it is.  Get a clunky sub somewhere.  You have to find yourself a shaky but nevertheless courageous captain when under fire.  You need an old grouch to give the kids good advice and stories of old wars.  Slap in the mandatory sub-chases-sub scene. The classic 'don't make a noise' thing (usually someone sneezes or falls down, or whatever).  Oh yeah, don't forget the sub that has to go REAL REAL down while everyone is hoping that it won't collapse under the pressure (it never does that anyway), complete with popping screws.I'm cynical here, but believe it or not, this was entertaining!  Once you get into it and forget all the Das Boots ever put on screen, it's pretty decent.  The screenplay is kinda interesting, and the acting is good.  Not great, not lame, an okay film.  Good fun.",Null,1,1,29 April 2000
Moulin Rouge!," Musical on acid
","I was not expecting anything from this - except maybe that the director being quite eccentric, something visually stunning.  I heard that pop music was used in a French-1900 background, but that's all.  So I expected a basic story, adapted music, and lots of flash.What it is is actually a speedy musical that grabs you from the beginning. If you let you get into it, it works.  Actually, I thought the pop elements were quite interesting - especially the montage on the rooftop (your won't listen to Kiss the same way after this!)Ewan MacGregor is very good - obviously putting all his heart into his role. Nicole is okay in a way - sometimes she just does not seem to want to work this out.Otherwise, very entertaining, if it was not for the relatively melodramatic ending, I would bring my 12 year-old daughter to see this.  By the way, the Moulin Rouge/Paris environment is irrelevant.  The film could have be done in a submarine and it would have delivered anyway.",Null,0,1,12 June 2001
