The Rock," Awesome Action And Suspense With A Great Story
","Needless to say, this is not the most realistic film out there, but that does not matter with a movie like this. This movie was made because it is a very entertaining story with a lot of edge-of-your-seat suspense and has the interesting pairing of Cage and Connery. Connery is very cool in his role as an ex-criminal and inmate of the notorious prison known as 'The Rock'. He somehow escaped and now must help the US Marines reverse escape in.Cage and Connery sneak and fight their way through the compound and manage to destroy the guidance systems in the missiles, making them useless.I think Cage and Connery did a very nice job with their characters. This is not the type of movie where they would get any sort of Oscar nod for it, but I think they did really well. The scene in the end where Cage is just barely able to give the sign to the pilots that he is okay is a very memorable one. It really gets you on the edge of your seat and almost makes you want to stand up and cheer.'The Rock' is an awesome action flick with a very solid story.",9,1,1,19 December 2009
The Devil's Advocate," Awesome Story To Be Told With Top Notch Characters
","This movie has come on television quite often ever since it came out and many times I happen to catch it I start watching because it is a movie that I can watch over and over again. I've probably seen this movie seven or eight times fully, not to mention several bits and pieces here or there.This is probably the best performance that Keanu Reeves has ever given. I'm sure it helped that he was acting alongside Al Pacino, who gives an awesome performance as the devil. He plays his part wonderfully. The way that the movie progresses from a small, religious, Texas town to a large, sinful city is done very well. The plot rolls along at a very good speed.The ending of the film is great as well. A lot of times an ending such as this one might seem cheap, but not here. It makes sense and really works here. I really love this movie and highly recommend it.",8,3,4,11 February 2010
Vertigo," Bit Of A Let Down
","I was a bit let down by 'Vertigo'. I watched it for the first time just recently and with all the great things I had been hearing about it for years and years, I was expecting something truly monumental. Even if I did not have such high hopes, I don't feel as though I would have been overly impressed, as I feel a 'pretty good' rating is spot on.It felt to me that everything was just too convenient to drive the story along. I mean, had Scottie not reacted exactly as Gavin and Madeline had anticipated, everything would have unraveled and fallen apart. This story just asks the audience to stretch reality to give them the benefit of the doubt one too many times. Later on, when Scottie finds Judy and falls in love with her again, it all felt so clunky. I'm not sure if he knew all along that it was or was not Madeline, but either way, the chemistry between the two characters left me scratching my head. The end with the nun felt all too random as well. My interpretation is that a thing of good had come to face Judy and Judy could not bear the wrongs she had committed, so she allowed herself to fall. It feels like a cheap ending. They might have just had Scottie wake up and said, 'it was all a dream.'",6,7,13,11 November 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Awesome Superhero Film. Wipes Out All Bad Memories Of 2003's 'Hulk'
","For everything that was wrong with 2003's 'Hulk', 2008's 'The Incredible Hulk' does right. It's kind of too bad that this movie came out right after the blockbuster 'Iron Man' because it kind of became a bit overlooked. I did like 'Iron Man' just a tad more than this, but only by a small amount. This was every bit as much an awesome superhero movie that 'Iron Man' was. Most people are somewhat familiar with Hulk, so they did not start this story with the birth of the Hulk character. Instead they could really start the story off quickly. I think that was a good idea. We saw that in 'Hulk' and it was not necessary to show it again. I thought Edward Norton played a great Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler also played a very good Betty Ross. Unlike the 2003 Hulk, this one really looked much, much better. Not only did his look improve, but his actions had more power than the 2003 version. The Hulk character is a tough one to make a story around since his power only works when he is angry, so I was impressed that this story really made sense and was very good.The Abomination character was also done very well. To me, it might take a certain kind of enemy for the Hulk character to have and they nailed it with him.The final scene of the film definitely made me very anxious to see more Marvel films, especially the one that will cap them all off: The Avengers.",9,3,4,12 February 2010
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Very Fun And Creative
","After having the opportunity to view this for over two decades, I finally saw 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and I must say that I really enjoyed it. The way that the characters interact with the toons is really well done. I know this is not the first movie where live action meets animation, but this film is very successful in it's execution.The script really drives this movie. It's really interesting to see the toon segregated and cast down by the humans as if they are Jews in World War II Germany. The fact that there is a mystery and we accompany Roger and Eddie is a very welcome task and makes for a fun plot. Roger is a very fun and interesting main character as he has many traits of Bugs Bunny, but with a darker undertone.This is a very creative movie and should definitely be checked out.",7,0,0,12 November 2009
Training Day," One Of The Best Characters Of The Twenty-First Century
","'Training Day' is an awesome film with one of the most memorable character of the 2000 through 2009 decade.Alonzo is one of the best characters in recent memory and one of the best villains in movie history. He begins the film as a good guy, showing Jake the ropes. He quickly becomes questionable with his techniques that just don't feel right. As the film goes on it is clear that Alonzo is very, very crooked and needs to be put in his place. There is a very memorable line from Alonzo during his drastic downfall, which is, 'King Kong ain't got s**t on me!' The way that Washington delivers that line during Alonzo's monologue is magnificent. Beyond the fantastic villain character, 'Training Day' has a great script. Yes, it is unlikely that all of this would take place in just one day if this was real life, but I firmly believe that that notion of reality can be stretched at times in cinema. There is little to be said on the plot, but it is just very well written and executed. Jake's good natured personality is a good opposition towards Alonzo, but his character is left in the darkness next to the brilliance that is Alonzo.I highly recommend this film. It is a fun story with a very memorable character.",9,1,2,13 January 2010
Wayne's World," How Could Anyone Dislike This Flick?
","This is a great movie. I would be hard pressed to find anyone who does not hold a fond place in their hearts for this movie if they give it a fair shake. This movie (in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way) really personified what life was like for most teenagers in the early to mid nineties. The movie gets an A+ for use of relevant pop culture and how they are used intelligently throughout the movie. Beyond the pop culture used in the film, 'Wayne's World' created much of its own. Mike Myers' and Dana Carvey's work as Wayne and Garth is phenomenal and nobody will soon forget the infamous 'Bohemian Rhapsody' head banging scene. 'Wayne's World' is a must-see for everyone whether they enjoy this type of film or not.",8,1,3,11 November 2009
Unbreakable," Good Idea, But It Never Really Delivered
","'Unbreakable' is a very mediocre film. I loved the idea for it. The concept of these two people having superpowers and the means that they go to discover them makes for an interesting plot, but the movie itself does not end up being as good as I hoped that it should have been. This film seemed to be a bore for me. I did not care for Jackson's character and I can't say that I was too fond of Willis' either. The fact that Elijah is the culprit of the accidents and is the villain to David, the hero, is something else that would seem to be a good twist, but it doesn't really come off that way. Instead I kind of found myself not to really care.I wish I could see the same idea for a film, but to instead use a different plot and different director. I think 'Unbreakable' had a lot of potential, but it just never found its rhythm. If someone asked me whether or not they should see this movie, I'd tell them to pass.",5,0,2,18 November 2009
12 Monkeys," A Great Mystery To Be Unravelled
","'12 Monkeys' plays as a great jigsaw puzzle that slowly pieces itself together to finally make sense in the end.The beginning is a mess. The audience has no idea what is going on, but it really made me want to continue to unravel the mystery. Throughout most of the movie you believe that James really is a time traveler who is out to stop the 12 Monkey Army, but somewhere in the second half of the film you start to think 'perhaps he really is just insane.' Willis and Pitt's characters work very well off one another during their time in the insane asylum. Of course, Pitt's character is very fun and I really wished he could have been on the screen for longer than he was. There is not much more I can really say about this movie. If you are looking for a mystery that you slowly solve throughout the course of the film, '12 Monkeys' is the perfect watch for you.",8,0,0,12 January 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Quite A Disappointment
","I liked 'X-Men'. I really liked 'X2' and 'The Last Stand'. I have thoroughly enjoyed every Marvel movie I have seen in the past decade (excluding Spider-Man 3). Needless to say, I was quite certain I was going to see a really good superhero film when I went to see 'Wolverine', but unfortunately this was not to be the case. The story just seemed half finished and poorly thought out. For example, they knew they wanted to include Gambit, yet had no logical role for him to fill, so they just used him in a totally unnecessary role with an unnecessary fight scene. I absolutely hated Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth, even more than I hated whoever played him in the first movie, which is saying a lot. Come to think of it, I really hated most all of the actors they chose to fill roles. From John Wraith, to Wade Wilson, to Gambit, to Scott Summers; they were all bad. It was neat to see the cameo of Patrick Stewart at the end though. I am all for taking a concept and doing your own interpretation of it, but that Deadpool character at the end was just so off the map and so lame. This movie gets a six only because it's a superhero movie (which I love) and the story, despite being poor, is not horrendous. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not absolutely love superhero movies.",6,0,1,11 November 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Lots Of Emotion And Depression
","This movie turned out to be quite a bit better than I thought it was going to be. When it began, and for the first twenty-five minutes afterward, I thought that this was going to be just a movie about Ennis and Jake having troubles herding sheep together and being gay. That would have been incredibly boring. To my surprise and joy, it changed after the first half hour and the story really picked up.The way that this movie showed the characters emotions was very nicely done. Above anything else, that is probably this film's greatest achievement. To say that the closing of this movie is sad is a gross understatement. Even more than the closing of it actually, a large percentage of this is very depressing. Neither one of the main characters (or supporting characters, for that matter) are happy in this film. This movie is so depressing at times that it turns into something that I would rather not be watching. I am very glad I saw this movie to understand what all the buzz was about, and it was much better than I was expecting. If you feel up for a depressing kind of movie, this is a pretty good one with a lot of character emotion shown.",6,4,6,16 January 2010
L.A. Confidential," Not As Cool As It Wants To Be
","I initially watched this movie back in 2000. In 2009, I was going through movies on IMDb to rate them and when I came across this I could not remember it at all. It had such a great rating and marvelous reviews, so I decided to watch it again.I now know why I did not recall the film initially: it really is not that good. It's okay, it's watchable, but I really do not know why so many people like it so much.It felt like this movie was trying to be too cool. I mean, no one talks like the characters in this movie do. With the amount of 'cool lingo' that they use I began to get lost with exactly what the characters were really saying. It's is okay to a point, but this movie did it far too much where it became distracting and very unrealistic. I really didn't care too much for the plot itself either. Again, it was okay, but I can think of plenty other cop dramas that are far superior to this one.Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors and Russell Crowe is usually very solid, but neither one did anything for me in their respective roles. I know many people disagree with me on this, but to me they both meandered along and never really shined. And the gun fight at the end was poorly done. Why can the good guys get shot multiple times and be just fine to continue, but the bad guys are always dead with one shot?I give this movie a six and say that it is 'slightly above average'. It is an okay watch, but there are many better movies of the same genre out there.",6,11,26,25 December 2009
X-Men," Could Have Been Better, But Enjoyable None The Less
","At first, I did not really care for this film because it was not true to the comic book story. But an old friend of mine gave me some advice: 'Just take it as a story from a different point of view.' Once I did that I really found this movie to be quite enjoyable.The overall story is probably a little sub par. In comparison to 'X2' and 'The Last Stand' it is by far the weakest of the three. Where there are now four X-Men titles out, we are accustom to the actors in the roles that they play, but when this originally came out I was astounded at the near spot-on job that they did with the cast. From Wolverine to Professor X to Magneto, I feel as though they did a wonderful job getting the characters to look like who they are supposed to be. And then there are new renditions such and the visually interesting Mystique. However, that being said, I feel that they really missed the boat on Sabertooth, and to a lesser extent, Rogue. There could have been better actors to play each part and the character of Sabertooth could have definitely been more interesting. On a side note, they didn't get it right in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' either. The action was cool and had they not had to spend time with character introductions they might have had more time to develop a better story, but for what it is it's a good movie to see to get you amped up for the superior sequels that follow.",7,0,1,11 November 2009
Shutter Island," If You Like A Good Mystery, You'll Like This
","Just when it seems like Hollywood is out of good, original movie plots, a film such as 'Shutter Island' comes out and proves me wrong. I know that it was a book originally, but they did a wonderful job adapting it to fit the big screen.This is a movie that I really enjoyed. The majority of the film plays as a mystery where the audience, as well as the main character, is trying to figure out what is really going on on Shutter Island.I was glued to the screen throughout the movie. There was a lot of mystery, but there was a lot of intensity and anticipation as well. At first glance, I thought that I had this movie figured out, but later found out that I was wrong.The look of the film was really cool too. The dark, frightening structure that was Block C overlooking everything from high on the bluff was nicely done. We knew that the action would eventually lead us there and it served for a good looming destination. A lot of times when a movie is set in dark weather, such as a hurricane, I find it a bit obtrusive to see exactly what is going on with the action. This was not the case here. The weather added to the plot of the movie and was not distracting at all.The acting and characters were all very good as well. The lead psychologists all add to the mystery of the island and you never know the true motives of anyone.This is an awesome mystery movie and anyone who likes a movie in that form will really like this one.",8,1,4,26 February 2010
Watchmen," Truly Disappointing
","In my opinion, this was the biggest, most hyped movie of the summer of 2009 and was also the most disappointing. If you have seen some other of my reviews, you would know that I love superhero movies. And the fact that this was going to be more gritty and aimed at older viewers got me excited for something different from 'Iron Man' or 'Spider-Man'. However, sadly this movie failed on almost every level.First, the characters are unlikable and poorly developed. They are not 'dark' in a cool way, but instead 'dark' in a 'I don't really want to watch these losers and scum bags' kind of way. The plot is all over the place and the director seemed to care more about making sure Dr. Manhattan's penis is featured rather than any emotion and passion from the characters. Throughout the movie I was just waiting for it to get over so I could do something else. If you're in the mood for a superhero you can pick almost any other one and it will be superior to this poor attempt.",4,6,11,11 November 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Astonishing And Mesmerizing
","Without a doubt, 'Terminator 2' is one of the best movies ever made and perhaps the very best action film bar none.The concept is absolutely superb and the execution could not have been better. It is indeed a sequel, but it can be watched without seeing the original because it really plays out as a stand alone movie. The Terminator is a great character and the way that John interacts with it is really beautiful. The cast is all wonderful and could not have done a better job with their roles. Linda Hamlton is great as a tough, strong woman, Arnold is great as the machine that has a hard time understanding humans, Edward Furlong is great as the wide-eyed teen who is fighting for his life, and Robert Patrick is great as an emotionless killing machine. Everything is just so right.Another thing that I must mention is the special effects. They were absolutely astonishing for the time. We had never seen anything quite like it in a movie before. Even today the effects are great. Individual scenes are all so memorable with this movie. From the motorcycle chase, to the hospital escape, to the liquid metal scenes, to the introduction of the Terminator, to the final battle and destruction of the terminators, everything is so perfect and memorable.The end is so great as well. I'm pretty sure I shed a tear when I first saw it and when the credits began to roll with the road in the background after Linda Hamlton's monologue, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It is that moving.If you have not seen this, everything else should be put on hold and this should be priority number one.",10,7,9,20 November 2009
Being John Malkovich," Odd And Interesting
","I feel that to say that this is and odd yet interesting movie really sums it up. 'Being John Malkovich' begins just as visually interesting as it does psychologically. After a wonderful marionette performance, the movie really entices the audience with the fascinating seven and a half floor. The characters we meet all have little tidbits about them that really make us want to know more. Why does the boss character not think that he can be understood? What is with the dark woman who Craig is lusting over? These are great ways to make the audience really want to keep watching.From there we get to the part where the characters 'become' John Malkovich. Everybody loves the idea of being a celebrity actor and the lives of everyone twist out of control. The idea of being able to control someone else as if they were really you seems to be the overall motif and the movie runs with that notion.I give this movie a seven, or a 'quite good' rating because it is very interesting to watch and the idea of it is neat. Going into a real life guy instead of a made up actor for the film was excellent. But I cannot give this film a higher rating because it was a bit to strange for my taste. I know that some people love this type of thing and 'Being John Malkovich' tops their list of best films ever. But personally I tend to like movies with a bit more realism involved.The last thing I want to say is that John Malkovich should be commended for taking this role. What an odd movie to be made about you.",7,0,0,9 January 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Not As Good As I Was Expecting
","I did like 'The Men Who Stare at Goats', however, it was not as good as I set my hopes for. This is one of those movies where the trailers and adds on television showed the funniest parts of the movie. The story was neither here or there and I spent a majority of the time hoping they would really go somewhere, yet it never did. I felt that the idea of the movie was very splendid, but the execution left a lot to be desired. Clooney and Spacey were great as always. Bridges (who I am not quite as familiar with) was enjoyable as well. McGregor was not bad, yet nothing special. Overall, not bad acting, not bad ideas, but the story could have been better. Check it out if you have a chance but don't worry if it passes you by.",7,87,153,11 November 2009
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Seek Out Something Else
","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' was not a movie that I would recommend. It was the first time that this style of film-making was seen in the US in such a large scale, and had other better films not come along after it might be something that I would have recommended.I was not very interested in the story or characters in this film. However, when this film came out in 2000, it was not popular for the story, but instead because of the unique look, style, and action. To its credit, all of those things are wonderful. The creators definitely knew what they were doing to make images pop out of the screen and seem magnificent.What makes this film sub par is the fact that 'Hero' and 'House of Flying Daggers' came out. In my eyes, both of those movies blow out 'Crouching Tiger' in every aspect, from plot, to characters, to beauty.If you really enjoy this style of film-making, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' would be another one to check out, but for the common moviegoer, I would suggest 'Hero' or 'House of Flying Daggers ' instead.",4,1,4,15 November 2009
2012," Good For The Effects
","For what it was, '2012' was not awful. It definitely looked cool in the theater. That is really the only way to see it as the special effects looked awesome on the big screen. Also, going into this I did not have faith that they would be able to make a film like this interesting to watch for all of two and a half hours, but I was pretty entertained for the duration of the film.Although the reason that I can't give this film a positive review is because there were just too many stupid, outrageously unrealistic parts in it. I did not expect complete accuracy or even a 100% realistic plot, but it was just too over the top in '2012'. Multiple times during it's run I laughed out loud at how stupidly far fetched the action was. One good example is when Jackson is driving away from the earthquake destruction in California. I could list many, many more, but I don't really feel like typing out the plot of the entire movie.If you want to see some cool effects and nifty images, check it out in the theater. If you can't see it on the big screen it is not worth your time.",5,0,1,19 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," I liked This A Lot
","Of the three (four including Wolverine) X-men movies, I enjoyed this one the most. I thought it was a fitting conclusion to the trilogy. When the original X-men came out I hated it because it was not true to the comic book story. But an old friend of mine gave me some advice: 'Just take it as a story from a different point of view.' Once I began doing that for the Marvel movies I really have enjoyed most all of them. There were a lot of things that happened that I was certainly not expecting (Cyclops dying in the very beginning, Professor Xavior being destroyed, Mystique and Magneto being depowered).With the exception of Juggernaut, all of the mutants look great I think they did a great job with Beast. Sure it would have been cool to see The Phoenix all fiery, but again, this is from a different viewpoint from the comics, so I can accept a different version of her. I'm glad that Colossus and Kitty Pride were given feature roles in this film, as they are two of my favorite X-men. This movie came out during the time that the Astonishing X-Men comic was in full force and even though this movie was not trying to take directly from the stories of that comic, it did look like the film borrowed snippets of ideas from time to time. Everything looked very cool in this movie and it is definitely a awesome movie, especially for someone who is a superhero fan.",9,1,2,11 November 2009
The Elephant Man," A Beautiful Movie With An Interesting Subject
","'The Elephant Man' is truly a beautiful movie. I have been interested in the elephant man for a while now (ever since an acquaintance of mine started painting several art pieces on him) but never really knew much about him other than the physical deformity. This movie is very nicely done and really makes you feel for John. It is very sad that he is treated the way that he is and you really root for him to make it in normal society. It is great to see him finally make it to the theater in his nice suit. The movie transitions from the positive theater experience to the horror of the public humiliation quite quickly, but it is a necessary one. It really helped to solidify our feelings for John.The way that he died was really great as well. He had been longing to be normal and had been looking at the photo of a person sleeping on their back for so long, that it was very beautiful that he finally felt normal enough in his last living moments.I have always hated David Lynch and when I found out that he directed this movie I became very worried, but I must say that he did a very good job. My only minor complaint was how many useless transitional shots he used. I get that they help to set the mood, but every one was a bit too long and he seemed to throw one in every few minutes. Things like pictures of elephants, or people working in a factory. Again, it is just a minor complaint and did not take anything away from the film for me, but I think they should have been minimized a bit.I must say that I was a bit disappointed to find out that a large part of this film is not historically accurate. Everything right down to his name (it was Joseph, not John). I have always said that I don't mind with movies if they are not the most historically accurate pieces of footage ever produced, but sometimes I feel like they should be pretty close. This is one of those examples.But nevertheless this is still a beautiful movie and should be seen.",8,1,2,13 January 2010
Hero," Likable
","As far as these types of movies go, I would say that 'Hero' is probably one of the better ones. Miles ahead of 'Crouching Tiger'. Jet Li looks very good in his role and does a magnificent job with the action sequences. I think it is neat that he remains nameless throughout the film. His character is really driving the movie as he really does look like a hero up against insurmountable odds. Zhang Ziyi is again typecast in the same role that US movie goers identify her to be in. She is on par in the role as usual. The sound and music in this movie are very fitting and assist the battle scenes. The colors are amazing throughout the picture. Whether a scene be mostly done in blacks and grays, or mostly reds and oranges, or any different colors, they always look beautiful. The shot with the arrows is a very memorable one. This movie is second to 'House of Flying Daggers', and is worth a watch.",6,0,2,11 November 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Great, Powerful, And Beautiful. A Magnificent Journey
","In my opinion, this was the best movie of 2009 (I know it technically came out in 2008, but that was a limited release and it did not come to my area until after the new year). I was truly amazed at the way that they achieved the impressive reverse aging process. Going into this movie, I really was not sure how they would accomplish that, but they really exceeded my expectations and did an amazing job. A lot of people complained about the length of this film, and it is true that it is long, but I feel that everything in the film was necessary and was all important to the story.I really loved how we were able to accompany Benjamin throughout the coarse of his life and be there throughout his many journeys. I really think this was a beautiful movie and it was neat with the uniqueness of Benjamin's disease. I think this is something definitely worth seeing.",10,0,3,19 November 2009
Donnie Brasco," Great Mob Movie
","It was not until 2009 that I saw this film and I'm not entirely sure how or why I never watched it, or really knew what it was about, until then. I say that because I really enjoy this type of film and I especially love Al Pacino. But anyways, I thought that this movie was very nicely done. The plot was solid and the characters were all really great. When movies on an interesting subject like this and done very well, it makes me want to learn more about said subject. So after watching this film, I spent a lot of time researching mob life and the 'five families' on Wikipedia. I only note that because I think that it says a lot about how this movie really interested me.It was really neat to see Johnny Depp in a serious role once again. He's a talented actor and very versatile, but I am very sick of him as Willy Wonka, Jack Sparrow, and coming soon as the Mad Hatter. Michael Madson and the rest of the cast were very good as well. I did not like this film quite as well as Goodfellas, but that is not taking anything away from this. I would recommend both if you're interested in mob movies.",8,1,2,7 December 2009
The Dark Knight," The Joker. Little More Needs To Be Said About This Film.
","I'm not sure what can be said about this movie that has not been said dozens of times already. This will probably be remembered as one of the best and biggest movies of the decade.I really loved this movie and, like everyone else, it was mostly due to the Joker character. The Joker is such an excellent character to begin with and this version of him may be the best. He was just so mad in an intelligent way. The dark setting of this movie was done very nicely and I thought the plot was much better than 'Batman Begins'. 'The Dark Night' definitely has some poor spots throughout. Christian Bale is back with another less than stellar performance. Not only does the Batman character not compare to the Joker, but he is downright goofy. The voice is atrocious and I do not feel he is right as Bruce Wayne either.This movie would be just okay without the Joker, but there has never been a movie succeed on such a large scale ever before due to just one character's inclusion. Hopefully the sequel will have another memorable villain.",9,1,2,11 February 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Way Better Than I Was Expecting
","Going into this movie, I was really not expecting to like it much, as it had been getting pretty poor reviews. Upon seeing it, I found myself to really enjoy it. I don't really understand why this movie had been receiving such mediocre to poor reviews.Actually, I take that last statement back. I actually DO know why it has been getting rather poor reviews. The reason is because people who grew up knowing the original Alice in Wonderland story were disappointed that this movie was not the same exact rehashing of that classic tale. I do not understand why many people are unsatisfied with an alternative look at an old story. Why would anyone want to see the same movie over, and over again anyways?The characters in this movie were really well done. I was not expecting to care much for Depp's Mad Hatter going into the film, but I found myself really liking what he did with the character. I also think that Carter did a nice job with all of the obnoxious yelling, a very important characteristic for the Red Queen to posses. With all of the unique characters (many of which seem to lack common sense), I was a bit worried that the plot would not be there. However I found myself pleasantly surprised that it was a lot better than I thought it would be. The story had a kind of a 'Chronicles of Narnia' feel to it. All characters were gearing up for a big battle at the end of Alice's journey.Needless to say, the look of the film was incredible. There was really almost too much to take in with just one viewing. Even little things, like when I noticed the birds holding up the chandelier in the Red Queen's quarters, really added to the movie. With unique characters, amazing visuals, and a solid plot, I thought that this movie is a great one to watch.",8,2,5,12 March 2010
Avatar," Good Movie, But Not The Great Triumph That You Hear About
","With all the hype, 'Avatar' had a lot to live up to. I thought it was a really great film, but it did not live up to all the hype for me. It would be one thing if it was the first 3D movie experience, but I saw 'A Christmas Carol' just two months earlier and knew what to expect on that front. The look of 'Avatar' is very cool. The landscapes are all wonderful to look at and with the all the glow-in-the-dark surroundings paired with the 3D environment it really made me feel as though I was in an attraction at Disney World rather than in a movie theater.The concept was pretty cool as well. I liked the fact that Jake lived these dual lives. It seems like careful planning would have to be taken when that sort of thing is to be achieved and it was done quite seamlessly here. As for the story goes, I thought it was okay. It reminded me a lot of 'The Last Samurai', only not done as well. The way that the enemy of the natives is taken in and then grows to love and belong to the civilization that he was once out to destroy. 'The Last Samurai' ends much better than this though. Here it is very predictable that the good guys will win, Jake gets to become one of them and gets the girl, and the humans are shipped home while nature prevails. A small nitpick that I have with this film is the year that it takes place in. 2154? So 144 years in the future the human race will develop all this new technology, discover an new planet in a new solar system, travel to it, and begin living and colonizing there? James Cameron really has a lot of faith in science and technology flourishing quickly.",8,2,5,4 January 2010
The Last Samurai," Very Touching And Moving
","I think that this is a wonderful movie about the samurai and how simple and beautiful life can really be. I'm not sure if this is the most accurate movie in the world, but I tend not to care as much about historical accuracies when going to watch a movie for pleasure and entertainment.When I first saw this in the theater I was in college. I remember upon returning to my empty dorm room that I just sat, mesmerized in thinking about how much history some people's cultures contain and how us as Americans have so little.The story of 'The Last Samurai' is magnificent and I thought that the end battle was incredibly moving. When the galitzers started firing, it really breaks your heart. It is very sad when Katsumoto dies, but it is amazing how he has garnered so much respect that even his enemies bow down to him in his final minutes of life. The character of Nathan is a good one and it is neat to watch him change and gain respect for the samurai throughout the coarse of the film.'The Last Samurai' is a great, emotional movie and it really made me think about American history compared to that of Japan's. Very moving and excellently done.",10,1,1,20 November 2009
Up," Great, But Not THAT Great
","Why oh why is this film so popular? I mean, I liked it, don't get me wrong, but to be currently rated number 62 of all time movies on IMDb? I just don't get it.This is hardly one of the best films, let alone one of the best animated films of all time. The house flying with balloons was a neat concept. The old man was a likable character. The time-lapse in the beginning was a splendid way to get things started, the fumbly, bumbly boy scout made for some delightful humor; all of these things made for one great kids and adults movie.However the dogs talking (and there was A LOT of that) was stupid (not to mention the flying planes), the bird was stupid, and there were portions of the plot I did not care too much for. 'Up' is a good movie for people of all ages and if there is one animated film of 2009, this is the one to watch. I just don't get why people like it beyond what I believe to be a reasonable amount.",7,0,1,15 November 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Amazing On All Fronts
","I have seen most of the Pixar/CGI-style family movies that have been considered 'very good' by popular opinion and I must say that 'How to Train You Dragon' may very well be one of the best.Whether you are male or female, young or old, I believe that this picture will appeal to you. The action is very solid throughout the movie. The outline of the film is described early on and everything flows at a wonderful pace through the duration of the film.The plot is also one of the best things about this movie. I really like the idea of a nobody telling all of the big shots that they 'have it all wrong'. Hiccup's character progression is done superbly throughout the story. He changes immensely, but it all makes a lot of sense.This movie does not lack action in it's conclusion either. The final battle against the massive queen is reminiscent to a final battle in a video game. She is so big and powerful that she seems unstoppable. If you are privileged enough to see this in 3D, you will be treated to some great 3D action. I've seen four or five movies in 3D now, including Avatar, and without doubt, this takes advantage of the new 3D technology over anything else that I have seen.This movie has heart, compassion, intelligence, action, humor, and a terrific plot. One of the best animated family movies I've seen in quite some time.",8,3,8,30 March 2010
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Cool Movie With Interesting Characters And An Interesting Situation
","'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a very fun criminal movie which keeps the audience quite entertained throughout. It starts out with a plethora of characters, each one more interesting and unique that the first. As neat as all of these characters are, it does get a bit confusing in the beginning to tell who's on whose side. Another problem that I had in the beginning was understanding exactly what was being said at times. Many characters used jargon and slangs that were difficult for me to follow. That added with the accents made it a chore to follow, but once the movie started rolling along, it became much easier to understand exactly what was going on.This is a very over-the-top film and is definitely meant to be that way. There were so many groups of criminals all fighting over the same thing that it was comedic and interesting at the same time. The placement of the guns as an object to fight over is nicely done as well. Nobody really knows what the deal is with them throughout all the madness and it is cool to see another object used that way other than just money. I liked the ending a lot too. The final scene when the audience gets to draw it's own conclusion to whether the heroes saved the guns or not was a nice way to close the film. This is a really cool movie of this genre and will leave you satisfied at the end. It was very well done.",8,0,3,30 November 2009
Zombieland," Fun Zombie Flick
","This is definitely a fun movie. I like the way that they outlined the plot through the 'rules'. The way that the characters interacted with the text on the screen was neat too.Tallahassee is the star of the show with his off the wall personality, yet likable traits. This is not a serious movie, nor does it pretend to be with the comical gore, among other things. The vibrant colors are a welcome change from how dark and gloomy most zombie pictures are shown. I might have been apt to rare it a bit higher than I did, but there was just a few too many times where I was rolling my eyes, despite the fact that this is not a serious film. For me, the cameo was totally unexpected and good for a laugh.Going into this film, I was really not expecting to enjoy it quite as much as I did. For a good hearted action/comedy film, check it out.",7,2,4,11 November 2009
War of the Worlds," Good and Forgettable
","'War of the Worlds' was a pretty good movie. I was almost apt to give it a seven, but it is just short of that rating for me. The movie is definitely not a unique one in that it is reminiscent to many alien movies, 'Independence Day' being the most obvious. But hey, I loved 'Independence Day' and don't mind seeing another film that is similar.Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors and he was good in this. Not as good as in 'Vanilla Sky' or 'Minority Report' or any number of his great performances, but good nevertheless. I typically hate most child actors, but Dakota Fanning has always been one of the better ones in my book and she is good in this as well. I definitely enjoyed this film, but it is very forgettable. There is just nothing that stands out. The monsters are neat, but not overly impressive. The acting is good, but not anything special. The story is interesting, but has been done before. I would recommend this to anyone as a very good blockbuster to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",6,0,2,17 November 2009
The Lion King," A Masterpiece
","This is an absolutely amazing animated movie, one of the best ever created. Who can say they didn't cry when Mufasa died. That is one of the most beautifully tragic scenes in cinema history. It is so great when kids movies include something that really evokes emotion and heart. Another classic scene is the final battle between Simba and Scar. It is a great climax to everything that lead up to it.Then there's Simba's birth and presentation. It is beautiful on the edge of the cliff in front of all the other animals. The characters are all great in this film and the soundtrack is one that everyone knows and remembers. I don't think I could think of another movie that has so many well known, original songs featured in it. 'The Lion King' is rated in my top three animated kids movies along with 'The Brave Little Toaster' and The Land Before Time'. It is truly a work of art.",10,2,2,19 November 2009
Sherlock Holmes," The Spirit Is There, The Execution Is Not
","Going into this movie I was not expecting much. It did not receive the best reviews and did not really look like the best adaptation of Sherlock Holmes to me from the previews. After watching it I do think it was a little better than I was expecting, but it still had very much wrong with it.First off, there was too much humor and dumb jokes for my taste. Some are certainly appropriate, as this is not meant to be the most serious movie of the decade, but it felt like every other line in the film was some stupid little joke.I thought the story started pretty bad and was pretty bad throughout most of the film. I did not care for all the supernatural aspects. But of course it turned out that it was all a trick, which made the plot as a whole a bit more acceptable for me. The worst part of the film was the conveyor leading to a saw scene. How cliché was that? I feel like I have seen this same scene eight hundred times before. Of course they are going to save her one inch from being cut it two. That is the way it always plays out. The whole conveyor belt leading to death scene should be banned from all movies from now on.I did like the way that Holmes deduced and explained things. Everything from the breakdown of his fights, to how he figured out his location when he was kidnapped, to his explanation of the case at the conclusion. It was all very in the spirit of what Sherlock Homes should be.I wouldn't recommend this for the price of a normal theater ticket, but perhaps for the cost of a movie rental.",6,2,6,28 December 2009
WALL·E," Wonderfully Simple
","Thinking back on all the Pixar movies I've seen I don't think there is one I enjoyed more than WALL-E. I think that it is a great triumph in this day in age to create an animated (not just) kids movie where the two main characters do not speak. A large majority of this film is more like a symphony that a modern film. The creators of WALL-E and EVE did a fantastic job of giving each character a face and a personality with what they had to work with. It really shows how actions speak louder than words. Sure WALL-E could say 'I love you' to EVE, but instead he tries to show her his plant, the thing that he finds to be the most fascinating and beautiful in all the world. Another nifty thing about this film is that it really tries to send a message. Beyond the messages of 'love is good' and 'be kind' which most every Disney movie conveys, WALL-E also sends the message that you should not trash the planet and turn into fat slobs. And I commend the way that it pulls no punches in doing so. It comes right out, slaps you in the face and says 'stop being lazy and take care of your planet.' This movie is the best Pixar has to offer and one everyone should watch.",8,2,4,11 November 2009
The Blind Side," A Feel Good Film That Will Leave You Smiling
","I really liked this movie quite a bit. It is a very 'feel good' film (almost too much so at times) with a main character who you will really root for. I liked the initial set up for the film, using the play with Lawrence Taylor to set the stage. They then show a scene 'two years in the future' of Michael being questioned by an investigator. At this point I was under the assumption that this story might lead up to Michael killing somebody through protection of his family or something; however, this scenario never plays out. Instead, he comes to be questioned for an entirely different reason. I like that it is not the tired murder scenario, that has been done to death. It was nice to see something different.The characters are all very likable in this film. I am not normally much of a fan of Sandra Bullock, but I think she did quite well with this role. Quintin Aaron did great playing Michael, and it was always suspenseful to see how Michael would react to each situation. What would he do when offered to sleep on the couch the first night? Or how would he react to the family's thanksgiving traditions?The ending was nice as well. I really liked how it synched up to actual footage of the Real Michael Oher at the NFL Draft. Up until this point I was not sure if this film was based on reality or not. I think this is a really nice film to watch and would probably suggest it to anyone.",8,1,2,5 December 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Wonderful And Hopeful
","This is an absolutely beautiful movie. I'm not so sure if it deserves to be the number one movie on IMDb, or how exactly it wound up there, but that aside I do really love it. You really feel for Andy and the rest of the prisoners in this movie. It's a shame to see the warden and prison guards having the power that they do over the inmates, especially since they are crooked, foul individuals.One great scene is that of Brooks after he is released. I can still remember the letter that he was narrating while it played out. Very nicely done. There are many memorable lines throughout this movie, many of which deal with hope which is a nice thing to hear about. The finale when you find out that Andy had been tunneling out for twenty years was a very powerful one. It was amazing to think about how it was accomplished and how he never gave up hope.The story really drives this film and the script is terrific. The performance and characters are top notch and this movie should definitely be seen by anyone who is a fan of movies.",10,0,0,20 November 2009
Vanilla Sky," This Is My Favorite Movie Of All Time
","Everything from the opening scene of a desolate Times Square to the final scene of David falling from the building, everything about 'Vanilla Sky' is beautiful and mesmerizing. The script could not have been better. With a mix of mystery, thriller, drama, and even a little humor, this film has the perfect balance of all of my favorite movie types all wrapped into one. I recently read online that one ending for this could have been that the entire movie was a dream or that it was all a fictional story written by Brian. I am really glad that they decided to not go that route and instead to have half the movie real and half of it a dream.Every scene in the movie had a purpose and it was all beautifully done. I already mentioned the first and final scenes, but there is also the car ride and crash, the scenes with the doctor where we try to figure out what happened, the party, the time he spent with Sofia, the night at the bar, and many more.I love Tom Cruise and thought that he was perfect for this role. The subtle things like his facial expressions or sarcastic reactions make him one of the best in the world at what he does. The supporting cast is also great in their roles. The music in this film also adds to the beauty and emotion. From David going crazy and singing 'What if God was One of Us', to 'Can we Still be Friends' when he is smothering Sofia with the pillow and especially with Sigur Rós playing in the final fall; all of the music that was chosen was right on point. I can't say enough about this film, but it is an absolute masterpiece. I will be surprised if I ever view a movie I enjoy more than 'Vanilla Sky'.",10,0,2,18 November 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Slightly Above Average
","Let me start by saying that I don't care much for Woody Allen's films. I find them to be pretentious with an annoying, snotty undertone. 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' definitely has some of that, but I supposed I enjoyed it a bit more than other Woody Allen films I've seen.This movie starts out as a complete bore for the first half until Penélope Cruz makes her entrance. Vicky, Christina, and Juan Antonio are all characters that I hardly cared about. And to make matters worse, they all have that 'we're so much smarter and artsier than everyone else' tone that many characters in Allen's movies have. Beyond the character flaws the plot is one that really just bored me.As I touched on earlier, Penélope Cruz really makes this movie. She plays her part magnificently and unlike the other main characters, Maria Elena is a very interesting character. She single handedly makes the second half of this film one hundred times better than the first.I was going to give this film a five for a rating, but I really liked the ending quite a bit. I like how the main characters did not necessarily get what they wanted, but things were still okay. All too often you'll get this type of film end with everyone getting exactly what they want, or if they don't, it is really traumatic. It was refreshing to see a movie of this genre end the way that this did. The part with the gun was cool too. It was definitely not how you expected the film to end.",6,0,3,29 November 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," One Of The Best Movies Of 2009
","I was very much on the fence whether or not to bump this to a ten or not. It is really a marvelous film to see. After just the first few scenes I knew that this was a film that I would want to see again one day based solely on how it looked and all the different things going on. There really is so much to see and it seems impossible to take it all in with just one viewing. This film has a look to it that no other movie I can think of has. It's very fascinating to look at. I love the way that the fur subtly moved on the faces of the foxes; a very nice touch.The script is really neat too. Going into it, I was not really sure how this film would come out plot-wise, but I think it really turned out quite nicely. I have said in other reviews that Wes Anderson is my favorite director right now and this film definitely has his style and wit throughout. All the characters are quite interesting as well. One of my favorite scenes was the introduction of the three human villains. It is very memorable and the descriptions used were very impactful. This movie is not realistic, nor does it try to be. Things such as the height of the characters seems to change to fit the desired situation, but that is easily forgiven. This is a great movie for everyone to check out and to use a line that almost every critic has used: it truly is fantastic.",9,0,2,4 December 2009
X2: X-Men United," Much Better Than The First
","This X-Men movie is great from beginning to end. The story was great, the fights were perfect, the characters were interesting, everything had a purpose, and it left you wanting more. This being a sequel definitely had an advantage over the first in the series due to the fact that the characters did not have to be introduced. Instead, the main arc of the story could take off right from the get go. Nightcrawler looks great and they did a wonderful job with the CGI of his teleportation ability. One of the only problems with this movie is that there are so many characters for a two hour film that all could not be included. Instead of having something going on, Cyclops had to spend most of the movie knocked out somewhere. I know I'm in the minority here, but personally I could have watched a four hour movie with a grandiose story which included all characters containing sub-stories for each to be occupied with. But I definitely know that most people have no desire to watch an extra long X-Men movie like that.I did enjoy 'The Last Stand' a bit more than 'X2', but that is by a very small margin. Both movies are terrific and worth seeing.",8,1,2,11 November 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Descent Yet Goofy Horror Movie With An Unforgettable Villain
","I finally viewed the original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' in 2010 and for what it was I thought it was a pretty descent horror movie. I kind of lump this in with 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th'. Of the three, I think 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is superior. It is less one dimensional than the other two movies. This movie is headlined by the character of Freddy Krueger, who not only has a unique appearance, but also has a unique personality. He is not all about business, such as Jason or Michael, but he is more about fun. His weapon of choice is also quite unique and adds a lot to his character.This idea that he is able to kill in people's dreams is a neat take on a slasher film. How do you beat the need to sleep? There was definitely a lot of silliness in this movie and even so much that it bordered and crossed into the realm of stupid. When Freddy was walking into all of the booby traps it felt as though I was watching 'Home Alone' rather than a horror movie. I also really hated the end. The 'Freddy's not really dead' ending was fine, but he was a convertible car? I just felt like they should have went out in a more frightening kind of way rather than a goofy one.",7,1,2,7 February 2010
The Truman Show," Beautiful, Original, And Epic
","If I had to pick ten best movies from the 1990's, 'The Truman Show' would definitely be on the list. Just when it seems like there are no more truly original movies to be made, 'The Truman Show' blows me away.After this movie came out, I think the thought that 'this could be happening to me' momentarily passed through everyone's head at least once. It really shows how expertly this film was made.I feel like I can say that without a doubt in my mind that this is the best Jim Carrey has ever been. I feel like he knew it as well. He was absolutely perfect with his mix of seriousness and humor. So much felt epic with this film. Remember the feeling when the show's director ordered to 'cue the sun'? Or during the beautiful, final scene when Truman's sailboat hits the painted wall and then Truman talks to the director and leaves? It is all very large and epic feeling. If you have not seen 'The Truman Show' then this needs to be next on your list.",10,0,1,25 November 2009
The Matrix," Intelligent And Awesome. Nothing Like It
","'The Matrix' is an absolutely awesome movie and like something I had never seen before. It is important to think of this film as one on it's own as opposed to part of a trilogy, since the two sequels were garbage compared to this.The idea for this movie was absolutely incredible. I have no idea how the writers thought up such an interesting, unique plot. Everything just made so much sense and aligned perfectly. The action was very awesome as well. It was reality bending, and beautifully performed. After watching this in the theater for the first time I jumped on my trampoline for hours, pretending in my mind that I was doing some of the kicks and fighting. There is so much from that movie that was, and still is parodied in pop culture; it really is remarkable.If there is one action movie to watch this may very well be it. It's a must watch for everyone.",10,1,3,19 November 2009
The Breakfast Club," Timeless Film With Many Classic Moments
","'The Breakfast Club' is an extremely fun movie that makes me smile to just think about it. I remember the first time I saw it, I did not know what to think going into a film entitled 'The Breakfast Club', but I was very satisfied once it got rolling along.It is cool to see all of the different types of high school groups represented and to see them interact in a Saturday detention. Throughout the film they all slowly realized that despite the very noticeable differences on the outside, the all have a lot in common on the inside.I don't feel that this movie is outdated. High school life really breaks kids up into different groups like this, but when you get down to it and the groups disappear the different seeming individuals can coexist nicely.This movie is filled with many classic scenes, but, of course, the best scene is the final one with the bully character walking through the football field while 'Don't You Forget About Me' plays loudly. Everyone who has seen this movie will always associate that song with it.",8,0,1,22 January 2010
Valkyrie," Good And Deserves A Watch
","For some reason it feels like this movie kind of just came and went when it was released and I think that was a shame. I really liked and thought that this was a very good picture and is one I would gladly watch again. Where some World War II movies can tend to be on the dull side, I thought that this one was exciting throughout. It was neat to see a movie with the major plot being a well thought out assassination attempt. It was enjoyable to root for Stauffenberg to get the job done.The characters were all good as well and I thought that Cruise did a very good job in his role.To my understanding, this film closely follows the actual events that occurred. It is nice when movies are able to do this all the while being interesting and fun to watch.I don't really see why this movie never received the very positive outing that I feel that it deserved. It is better than you might hear. Worth a watch.",7,0,0,18 November 2009
The Wizard of Oz," A Masterpiece
","To say that 'The Wizard of Oz' is a masterpiece is almost an understatement. It is absolutely beautiful and wonderful. Looking at it here in 2009 it is amazing to think it was made seventy years ago. What an achievement.The star of the show is the transition from the black-and-white of Kansas to the color of Oz. You cannot believe your eyes. The characters are just so right. Their mission makes sense and it is great how it is all accomplished. It is very hard to comment on this film because there is just so much that could be said about it. Sitting here writing this right now is very difficult because my head is racing with ideas and things that I want to say. I feel like I could write a fifty page review on it. It is so clichÃ© now for stories to end with 'it was all just a dream', but back then it wasn't. Even if this was made today, the dream ending would not seem like a cheap ending because it just fits so perfectly. It is definitely the best one in cinema history. This is a film that everyone should see. It will never become outdated. It is truly perfect.",10,2,3,25 November 2009
V for Vendetta," Looks Great But Turns Out To Be Disappointing
","I was not too pleased after watching 'V for Vendetta'. Aside from the hokey title, everything about this movie looked to be a real winner to me. The subject matter is one that I typically enjoy, the V character seemed to be quite interesting, the film was a mystery / thriller, I typically like Natalie Portman as an actress, everything looked like it would be a very good movie.However, once this film started rolling along I found myself puzzled as to the direction that they were going with it. One of the biggest problems I had with this was how the kidnapping and torture of Evey was a set up by V to show her 'what it was like to really be free'. This is not the first time that I've seen something like this and it just seemed stupid to me and a half thought out explanation. Aside from that, I didn't really find all that much wrong with this film, but it just didn't hold my attention and it was not as good as I though it should have been. Straight up in-the-middle rating of five for me.",5,5,12,18 November 2009
