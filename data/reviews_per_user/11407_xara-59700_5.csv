It," Fearless Disney-dialogue kids in an uneven bloody Disney- adventure
","Worst dialogue ever. Extremely well-made scenes and good actors are dragged through too much make-up and putty, leaving the movie nothing but a soulless, failed copy of a good original with heart. The dialogue is copied from Disney's teen programs and 'spiced up' with a lot of cussing, in the hopes that that somehow will catch the interest of the audience and make it seem more 'authentic'. Sadly, the movie makers didn't have trust in the creepiness of the original story, so they had to overdo everything- even the main character- the clown, which now is not even a clown anymore, but an obvious monster with not sharp teeth, but 10000000000000000 sharp teeth to make it extra scary. It's very difficult to feel for the characters as they don't seem real, since the dialogue so planned and predictable- just like the Saturday morning Hannah Montanas... I would, lastly, like to give credit to the well-made scenes, backgrounds and special effects. For once, they were well made. Sadly, very little is left to the imagination, and the movie does not linger in one's mind after the ending credits, like the original.",5,0,5,19 September 2017
Bird Box," Worst dialogue and storyline for one of the best story ideas of 2018
","The whole movie is a spoiler in itself. You know who will die and how they will die, if you've ever watched any b-rated movies in the 90's. All characters are empty stereotypes and there are too many holes in the story to not be noticed. I am surprised how none of the people had ever heard of blind people before in their lives. One of the characters gasps 'we're not going to survive if we can't see!' and all of them have trouble navigating without sight but yet REFUSE to use a blind stick for navigating... apparently they don't exist in this world.
What does exist are invisible gyms and protein bars seeing as the handsome black fella (the pretty boy in the club who naturally gets to 'boink' the pretty girl in the club and is- you know, the one who is not funny because he's pretty and therefore must be heroic) seeing as his muscle tone is equally pumped up after 5 years of no training in a world where food is scears.. (or maybe he steals all the food from the kids, who knows...).
If Macauley Culkin is not getting any royalties for the copied dialogue he ought to. It was as funny then as it is today.",2,125,203,17 January 2019
Bird Box," If you wasted 2h watching this I'm sorry for your loss
","Nothing original at all. Visually appealing- storywise appalling, especially the dialogue.. that stiff.propaganda.stereotypical.non-relatable.dialogue...
Seriously- this would've been too much even in the 80s.
American movies that glorify war, soldiers (they're all heroes right), stereotype women and black people.. that asian gay dude... that Clint Eastwood character who is truly appalling and selfish but comes through for you at the end of the day and sacrifices his life for you (cause actually he's a good man.. he's just had a rough life) ... the muscular guy who gets the pretty girl (god forbid the prize- aka the girl is won by some loser who doesn't look like a Hollywood-stamped 'proper man'... that funny, fat black bloke (can't be a woman, girls are not funny) who's actually not that funny and thus earns a spot on the 'we-who-die-first' list...
Shall I go on..? Nah, if you watched this movie you already wasted a couple of hours that you'll never get back. I am sorry for your loss.",2,2,4,9 November 2019
Warrior," Fantastic Jean-Claude Van Damme movie from the early 90's!
","I think IMDb made a mistake writing this movie was made in 2011. It clearly is made in the early 1990's- the story, moral and World view proves that it is an early remake of every Jean- Claude Van Damme movie ever made up until that time. Also- it features a scary communist man from the threatening country of the Soviet union. This movie concentrates on telling the fantastic story of two American (the only nation that counts) brothers- sportsmen who go to war every time they step out on 'stage', much like when Serena Williams or Roger Federer steps out on court in the U.S. Open and the chair umpire yells 'Fight!' right before they open 1st set (Mortal Kombat later borrowed the idea). In the movie one of the brothers is a kind and good man (..actually they both are.. all men are good men.. wait- well they usually are in movies, right..?) and a loving husband and father, who doesn't want to fight but is left no option since an evil bank has ripped him off. Luckily he's American because in America regular people like that can moonlight (like Walter White does in Breaking Bad- to pay his medical bills in a country that saves its people from the evil grips of socialism) as one of the 16 BEST fighters in the world- which he luckily happens to be although he's hidden it for many years. The other brother who also happens to be one of the 16 BEST fighters in the world is an ex-soldier in that country of Iraq, where he bravely saved an American soldier and was considered a war hero (this I find confusing- don't you get to be a war hero when you kill people..? otherwise any like doctor could be a hero, right..?). He is very modest and a true Christian, because he does not care about fortune and fame. In fact, he changes his name and gets out of Iraq and into America under false pretenses (when you're American you don't need a passport- all you need to do is say you're American) so no one knows who he is. They both enter the greatest MMA tournament of the World (in America). Since the soldier brother doesn't have any family that he cares about or friends it's a good thing that he doesn't win the fighting tournament that occupies the last 1h of the movie, but his loving and fatherly brother does, the one who actually needs the money for his children and wife (who is useless, but looks like a supermodel- a typical American woman). The ending I really haven't seen in any other Hollywood movie except a Jean-Clause Van Damme movie or perhaps anything remotely related to Disney... or Steven Spielberg.. or anything from Hollywood that slightly resembles any of the previously mentioned. The movie is really great for people who are vacuum cleaning while watching it or simply has the level of a general American high- school education recently graduated or likes the story line in MacGyver (again, 80's).",1,14,34,22 February 2017
The Descent," Nice claustrophobia- feel, horrible dialogue
","Semi- original idea with a claustrophobic anguish successfully construed. The dialogue is horribly poor- unfortunately so much so that the actors seem like amateurs. However, the dialogue is as good as can be if written for female characters by a man who has never experienced women outside of 'sex and the city'- which was also written for men by men. If the movie was written by a professional (aka a person who can cover these aspects needed to be covered in the story) it would make a hell of a difference. One could then even forgive the lack of muscle power in these cliffhanger's arms as well as the fact that they seem to have orgasms while hooking the ceiling to rope. Plot a little too obvious and non-surprising for anyone with an IQ over 100.",4,1,5,26 March 2017
