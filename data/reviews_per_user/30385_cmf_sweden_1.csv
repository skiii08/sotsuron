Catch Me If You Can," Cute based-on-a-true-story Hollywood convertible.
","Based on the true story about Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) who becomes a con artist after leaving home in his late teen ages. Good entertainment, but sometimes ends up moving quite slow. Personalities are just as Hollowood shallow as always, which is the main reason why this movie can't score.Compared to The Talented Mr Ripley or the French original Plein Soleil this movie is nothing, and it is a complete mystery to me why 2 out of 3 guys in the IMDb staff rated this movie as a 10. I thought one should be careful with that mark.7 out of 10.",7,0,1,11 January 2003
