Alien 3," Hollywood art house - most underrated
","Amazing film filled with great atmosphere, most hard production, and also great soundtrack. For me this movie is really great - why? because everyone hates it, maybe because i've first watch it when i was like 13-or 15 yrs old, i didn't know there was 3rd film there was a rainy weather it give me great influences as an artist, this movie not for everyone i must say. it's pure art-house, David fincher great director thanks for this movie. i watch it like 100 times no jokes. Most atmospheric film i like it's abandoned atmosphere. i know that everyone hates because hicks and newt dying, but its evolution of my favorite universe Ripley is still alive shes a main character she don't need anyone, most underrated movie. sorry for my dull English knowledge. take care, i advise that movie to watch it's for the all times. actual in 2011 and beyond.",10,5,6,31 January 2011
