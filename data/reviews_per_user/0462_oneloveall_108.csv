The New World," Meandering nature sucks life out of movie
","I have great appreciation for writer/director Terrence Malick's personal philosophy when it comes to film making, having a hard time rating such a sensual director as merely average. The artist's approach at capturing a moment rather then commanding it often times has paid off with sincerely improvised performances and camera-work. However with The New World, this film-making philosophy has unwittingly reared it's pretentious, over-bloated head and seemingly bludgeoned it's powerful themes to death. It is truly a lack of substance in the script that further renders the too many 'busy shots' shallow in context with a film that failed to keep me interested in the characters with it's meandering, self righteous narration and over zealous score. Malick's direction works best at first, before his thoughtful tone poems turn into gimmick. At the heart of the truth from this movie, there are many lush moments of photographic grandeur to behold of the purity of our earth, and those that strive to live in harmony with it, in part articulated by Kilcher's spiritual performance. As this New World is initially being explored by Farrel and viewer, the obvious reverence for the land Malick tries to induce does shine through, although once this theme is established this exercise feels routine. It is in the developing plot, or lack thereof that the film fails to accentuate it's beautifully shot, stream-of-consciousness homage to the source material. For some reason, Malick's work somehow seems a little too self important for it's own good.",5,3,7,5 May 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Excellent synthesis of controversial character is nevertheless starting to show wear and tear
","Although worthy of nearly all the praise it has received, I must still confess that a torrential downpour of critical and public applause garnered with Borat's feature film debut left me asking where all the actual belly laughs were. Granted, being a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's earlier HBO show does not help, as so much of the material Cohen uses, while admirably delivered and always uncomfortably topical, often recycles itself, usually to a point that fans of the comedic giant's past work would immediately recognize many of the lines uttered throughout this depraved travelogue.What separates the film incarnation from so many well delivered Ali G episodes does however justify a distinct appreciation. The well executed method finds loosely scripted, fictionalized plot setup running side-by-side with real world outings in which our Kazakh hero traverses the American landscape, brutally and unabashedly holding up reflections of ignorance for a general viewing public to revel in. These shocking, tension filled improvisational spats Borat engages in with all facets of the American public make for the most substantial segments, although in all honesty I was hoping for more subtle awkwardness then brash vulgarity. For too much of the films brief length, Cohen tries to shock viewers into contributing to the whirlwind of controversy the movie became, and by and large the excessive graphic nudity detracted from the flights of brilliance; what could have became one of modern film's most offbeat and unusual fight scenes became a cheap and blatant attempt at gross out theatrics.Though the pseudo-documentary may play the cheap cards a little too often considering Mr. Cohen's immense comedic talent, the foolish emotional arc that drove this tiny plot added a needed angle to Borat's film incarnation, helping flesh out much of the one-dimensionality. Strict fans may be a little disappointed with constant references from previous jokes, but the rest of the nation should continue to echo the praise this movie has garnered for being one of the most daring, relevant comedies to challenge society in years.",7,19,31,22 February 2007
Mission: Impossible III," A few wise choices elevates the mediocre franchise
","Clearly overstepping the predictable boundaries of previous installments, though not altogether triumphing, MI3 nonetheless turns out to be the most entertaining of the three for many reasons, though primarily for the casting of Phillip Hoffman as the villain, and the fluid, engaging direction by JJ Abrams. Essentially telling the same story for the third time, the less exciting original and ridiculously over the top sequel finally meets it's equilibrium in this third installation. Mainly the credit goes to Mr. Abrams for finally getting the tone right for the majority of the film. Displaying remarkable competence, Abrams few (though popular) television credentials still could not have predicted how well this director (and dabbler in all other departments) rose to the occasion for his massive big screen debut. Starting in atypical (though slowly becoming typical) fashion with the climax, the direction manages to stay involved throughout the briskly paced film, almost, but not quite, up until the end. It is only in those final minutes that the film resorts to archetypal fluff that will likely leave a bad taste in viewer's mouths who were appreciating the fresh pace. What really puts the icing on this action packed wallop however, is Hoffman's commanding take on what could only be characterized as a generic bad guy. In just about any other actors hands, this role would be left out to fester in the sun for the stereotypical writing that it is, but in Hoffman's interpretation, somehow the most generic of roles becomes a subtle revelation of classic Hollywood typecasts. Of course, the stunts are what fans want, and stunts they get..While nowhere in the league of the ludicrous stylings of MI2, the action here still manages to be as over the top as ever, Abrams merely opted to photograph and choreograph in a much more realistic fashion. Still nothing to rave about, MI3 does wrap up this trilogy with it's most engaging episode to date.",6,0,0,5 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Slix Stlars
","Enteraining caper tries to pull a Usual Suspects, but comes across being a little suspect itself. While the movie flies along with assured direction, highlighted by the great cast and peppered with insightful dialog, Slevin definitely is the forerunner for this year's hip crime flick for the uninitiated. For all of it's witty reinvention , Slevin at times comes across as silly, shallow, and quite naive. Although one should suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride with a movie of this nature, too many 'revelatory' moments in the film's final act sort of bog down the flow, trying a little too hard to shove that shock factor down our throats. Cast is fine, although they rarely achieve anything past the fundamentally cartoonish nature of these larger the life characters, an all too often used move in the world of threateningly entertaining capers catering to the young and hip. Make no mistake, Slevin is a good time to be had, especially if one is in the mood for a watered down Tarantino kind of night, but all of the hype surrounding the plot twists, while at it's best wickedly entertaining, does not really get past the self-importance, and slightly forced hip factor this fun movie sets out to capture.",6,0,2,10 September 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Bland remake coasts by on star power
","Underwhelming western update feels distinctly hollow as it awkwardly stumbles through insufficient plot points to arrive at it's shootout climax. Although the final showdown might be the only thing worth waiting for in this overrated and detached yarn, 3:10 to Yuma manages, in it's own goofy modernized way, to pay tribute to American film's favorite pastime- I can only attribute our country's love for the genre as to why the movie simply was not received as mediocre.Director James Mangold holds a lot of the blame for failing to build up the inevitable showdown through clumsy, unintuitive direction and a distinct lack of authenticity pervading nearly all sets and performances. Actors like Crowe and Bale will try what they can to rescue some of the film's blatant simplicities, but are given a script with far too little detail to make any true characteristic impressions with roles that both should have provided more depth. Nonetheless, this tragically modern remake will sit well with western fans expecting their yearly genre comeback, only this time you can leave the tension, grit, and nuance at home.",5,5,8,31 December 2007
Marie Antoinette," Interesting, sumptuous mistake tries to distract with large budget
","At turns refreshingly innovative and pretentiously shallow, Marie Antoinette is a difficult film to gauge due to the unique angle Sofia Coppola employs for the period piece. While strangely hypnotic at times in it's blissful capturing of pleasure, the film often feels unfocused as well, dangerously teetering between artsy production and vanity project, rarely becoming anything more meaningful. Giving the notorious queen an updated relevance may bode well in creating some sort of historical context for an oblivious demographic of MTV teenage girls, but anyone mature enough to realize the difference between style and exploitation will find that many of the scenes feel repetitive, with the ravishing set design playing front and center to the stubbornly plotted events that relay (through some sort of obscure fact-based mythology) France's public enemy number one before, during and throughout her troubled reign. One must give Coppola some credit for at least attempting something quite unique though. In the film's greatest moments, where the fickle, care-free parties of the decadent royal family are breezily edited amidst the contrasting modern day indie soundtrack, there is a certain guilty pleasure and an articulation of fun that really hasn't been explored in the context of a historical film. However, it becomes increasingly apparent that the director used this premise merely to indulge her fondness for the exquisite lifestyle the queen was involved in, shunning a majority of context and depth in favor of the effervescence that dominates the tone here. The much talked about modern musical selections playing to century old antics, scored as they are, do capture a few select moments of glaring, and daring beauty (think of the brief use of the cure when they are walking down the steps), but too often only feels right in fleeting moments of the scene and awkward during the rest. Plagued by a few technical blunders and the distinct lack of authenticity in the performances (Kirsten Dunst does have some amazing moments- but no one is even trying to sound believable, as personified in the modern day, off-key ridiculousness of Jason Schwartzman's Louis XVI), the monumental set design does not really compliment most of the content here, no matter what Coppolla's misdirected though promising artistic ambitions thought they were achieving. As such, the movie does have some amazing moments that will be magnified depending on the size of your viewing screen, but by and large it plays out immaturely and insults the viewer with it's unfocused approach.",5,2,3,10 February 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The new action prototype
","Although this movie is (rightfully) credited with taking the action-adventure genre into bold new territory, following all the film's well-placed elements just might have taken away from the overall adventure.Yes, this does seem like the most mature of the three, with a plot that respects it's characters and history as much as the exotic action and intrigue. But in turn, this may hamper the pacing of the film, feeling less of a unified, far-off adventure then a series of wonderful and imaginative set-pieces set to aid the acquisition of the Ark.Obviously, being the first installment in this legendary series has not lost it's significance, as fans clearly cherish this one above the others. It very well may have more soul then the later two, but as a pure immersive adventurer, suffers from some first-time tweaking.",7,0,1,18 May 2008
United 93," Respectfully made, realistically executed, powerfully emotional
","Unflinching in it's realism, United 93 comes as close as possible to recreating the real time drama that unfolded on 9/11, using the one failed terrorist plot as a focal point. While we may never know the particulars of that mysterious day, and can quite reasonably argue that perhaps the events unfolded in an entirely different way then what was portrayed, one can certainly not fault the humble and passionate filming of Paul Greengrass, as he relentlessly parlays all of the 'facts' as we have come to know them into an amazing piece of pseudo documenting. Painstaking detail is given to the inept bureaucratic formalities that kept the good guys from pursuing the quickest course of just action, starting with the brilliantly plotted introduction of the 1st plane crash via air traffic control. From then on out, the chaos that continued to multiply on that frightful day is offered amazing counterpoint with the quiet, intuitive struggles that went on over Pennsylvania on United 93. While the action is certainly intense, the majority of time on board is spent simply being with these individual characters, but due to the quick edits and frantic nature, not long enough to gain any real connection with. However, the focus on environment rather then individual characters does tend to immerse the viewer into this unprecedented experience that much more effectively. Certain 'patriots' who immediately play the exploitation card as a reason to boycott anything creatively done in the name of September 11th, should first at least check out the DVD extra's, which elegantly details the entire flight's families considering, accepting, and eventually embracing the idea of what this particular movie was to be all about. In the climactic throngs of unity, emotional truths massively outweigh whatever grudges anyone could seemingly muster for this must see, as the year's most powerful final scene reminds us in all that is good with humanity, and it's offspring, the arts.",8,2,4,4 September 2006
Deja Vu," Clever manipulation makes a generic scenario seem fresh
","A serviceable action thriller, given your typical Tony Scott quick cuts and typical Denzel Washington protagonist, still manages to rise slightly over it's tired mechanics with the inclusion of a well integrated science fiction element. For the first half hour of Deja Vu, viewers may be shaking their heads in disappointment, fearing that they are watching the same old mainstream cop mystery they have seen a thousand times over. Scott's typical direction does not help freshen things up either. What was once entirely stylish, edgy film-making has become completely predictable with grainy coloring, frenzied editing, and generic scoring somehow making the film feel dated more then it has any right. Viewers are taken through a typical detective procedure, as Washington's tired ATF agent tries desperately to gather clues from a massive explosion that rocked a newly opened New Orleans port. Certainly not a chore, the setup here remains completely average with hardly an effort made to differentiate this film from the many others like it, some starred in and directed by this team themselves.Thankfully, once the routine plot mechanics are set into play, Deja Vu finally offers up what will separate this popcorn movie from countless imitations. Borrowing from what made guilty pleasures like Strange Days such voyeuristic fun, the neat concept this script introduces, regarding what seems like the ultimate in surveillance security, will help take the generic thriller to fairly unique sequences. Toying with concepts of time travel while centering around this cat-and-mouse game helps Scott get some extra mileage out of the vehicle, and finally gives him a reason to implement all of the hyperactive edits he relishes in so much. Rather then barraging viewers with an onslaught of creative direction (which has been shown to prove contradictory and excessive with previous releases), Scott wisely finds a proper venue to work his magic. It is in these dazzling sequences of omniscient direction, when Washington is monitoring potential subjects with the precision of an infinitely floating camera eye, that any unique perspective and technical accomplishment shines through the otherwise predictable work.Suffering from a typically bland lead performance from the uninspired Washington, a confusingly underwritten antagonist played by Jim Caviezel, and a denigrating plot twist that makes the far-fetched reality behind this seem even sillier, Deja Vu is still a trip worth taking once (though no need to repeat!) for the brief stride hit in the middle which elevates the stereotypical proceedings with a fresh sheen of techno-paint.",6,0,0,22 April 2007
Casablanca," Splashes of timelessness
","A movie that failed to live up to it's historic praise for several reasons.Mainly, the chemistry between these two just does not feel as heart-tugging as one would expect. Actually it feels a little creepy at times, in a father/daughter sort of way.Bogart of course remains the picture-perfect image of an old Hollywood, jaded leading man, but ultimately feels like a subtle caricature as the one-liner's role on.The final scene, after hearing so much about it, left me wanting more, and not in a love-lingers-painfully kind of way either.Despite these imperfections, Casablanca still has numerous moments where you do see cinematic time stopping and the historical relevance of the work starting to make sense. It is simply a matter of differentiating what the public has made legendary and what actually works even today.",6,3,10,14 February 2008
I'm Not There," A celebration of change
","Sure this is not for everyone, and unless you have at least a minor special place in your heart for Mr. Dylan, and are somewhat familiar with his life story, many of the film's brilliant moments may be lost. However, those hoping for the closest thing to a musical tribute to one of the modern age's largest and most enigmatic icons should be singing the praise of Todd Haynes and his insightful, perceptive, and classy way of handling the material.Conceptually, I'm Not There seems like a bigger gamble then necessary. Using six totally different types of people (black boys, women, etc) to highlight a different period of Bob's life might have seemed pretentious on paper, though it remains evident why some big names attached themselves to the project after reading just that- Haynes produces the uncanny feeling of prodding this man's public soul in a way that is neither stubbornly elusive or obnoxiously obvious.It's a bit slow to start, and the movie is not without it's weak segments, but framed around Cate Blanchett's rightly praised, scene-stealing turn as the most provocative of the Dylan personalities, Haynes has pieced together one of the most rewarding puzzles of '07.",7,2,3,15 May 2008
Citizen Kane," An unarguable masterwork
","There's not a whole lot to be said about the film that constantly gets cited as the most influential film of all time- it's stylistic and thematic shadows have loomed over American cinema for more then half a century: of it's innovations, praise cannot be oversold. Frame after frame, scene after scene, we witness a stunning freedom from being outside the creatively parasitic bubble that was old Hollywood, afforded by Citizen Kane's masterful star and creator Orsen Welles in a way anyone entrenched into the business of making movies at the time it seemed had no perception about.With all the controversy concerning the studio and artistic control giving way to Citizen Kane resting high above the AFI's greatest lists most years, you would think the moneymakers would grasp the concept that great things can happen when great chances are taken. Though far from being perfection in motion all the time, Kane is worthy of the lazily used word classic more then just about any movie before or since in this country, if only for it's film vernacular innovation and articulation.",8,0,1,21 February 2008
Amistad," Preachiness drains the spirit
","Period courtroom drama Hollywoodizing the infamous slave ship rebellion and subsequent history-changing trial starts off promising enough but slowly erodes whatever truthful moments do occur. Spielberg is at his best when action is at the fore, but always frames his moralities around heavy-handed, condescending clichés which just continues to drain the soul out of this film, despite Hounsou's overbearing effort to achieve just the opposite.Despite it's acceleration into mediocrity, Amistad is one of those movies that should be seen once, if for nothing then production alone. There are definitely a few strong points (the opening scene really set the bar too high, huh?) and the acting, when not charismatically lukewarm, holds a few high points (Hopkins, before he started to become the apathetic, approaching-senility oldie he so keenly plays here).",5,2,6,21 February 2008
The 13th Warrior," A boring story against a mediocre backdrop
","Unspectacular adventure film tries vainly to mimic successful traits of past explorer-type movies, though really has no script to back any of the budget up. Those that get excited and long for the glory days of action ala Conan and Indiana Jones may have little else to turn to these decades, but as the uneventful proceedings of the 13th Warrior show, one needs to have a driving sense of mystery in order to perpetuate the adventure.This film has none of that. With a simple premise setting these 13 warriors off to counter an evil force, the uninspired screenplay simply brings viewers through the tired motions. Antonio Banderas, not as bad as I thought he would be here, can still hardly do anything to rescue this methodical homage to cinematic glory days of old. He plays The 13th Warrior, a foreigner who has been chosen to accompany a rogue group of vikings on their quest to seek out and destroy this evil presence.And that, is basically as specific the will plot gets here. Banking on pricey set design and pseudo-spectacular battle sequences, the mediocre project fails because it does nothing to invest the viewer into what producers must have felt was priority here, making the entire journey feel like a few over-bloated set pieces with nary an explanation to hold the action together. Director John McTiernan, of Die Hard fame, is just not in his element here, and with careless editing, lackluster performances, and a shallow story from Michael Crichton, The 13th Warrior will be unnecessary to all but adventure film fanatics.",4,1,2,9 May 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Less personality and more focused adventuring makes for a tighter popcorn swashbuckler
","When version number two of the expected Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy came out it was near universally met by critics with dumbed-down groans, the usual lamenting done for a sequel that sells itself short on the personality and originality that thrived in the first place, and puts instead in it's place the over-bloated, inauthentic substitute for personality through mindless action sequencing, peppered with the franchise mentality of sameness, repetition, and reiteration. Not surprisingly, these critical warnings issued by our film protectors were amply ignored by the film-going public, making Dead Man's Chest the surprise top grossing movie of last season. For once I must admit the general public seemed to have gotten it right. Pirates II may not be as authentic, personal, or charming as it's predecessor, but in my experience it was a more fluid, well plotted, entertaining excursion out to sea. Whereas part one seemed to lack direction in it's script, gleefully bouncing around from one local to the next without doing much to justify the transition, Dead Man's Chest seems way more the traditional adventure these pirates were meant to have. I also have heard complaints in Johnny Depp's declining authenticity in the lead role of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow, and must also scratch my head. While the lines that were written for him may have been layered on a little too thick, Depp almost seems to be more subdued in the role now, which helped take the focus off of his every drunken stumble and peculiar facial expression that the first concentrated on heavily, to a fault of the plot. Here, Sparrow and company seem to have a more clear cut purpose which helps viewers engage in the adventure all the more. While we are still dealing with essentially the same misadventures at sea (continuing right where the original ended), the arc here feels more like the big budget, high seas extravaganza the franchise wants to be. Of course the over-utilized Orlando Bloom does not help make things any easier on us, especially when asked to accept Mr. Bloom as the heroic savior certain scenes wish to implement, of which the boyish actor simply does not have the gravity to convey. Despite less focus being on the actual characters, helping to fill out the script are the budding moral conflicts arising in these main protagonists , giving the fun affair an extra shade of dimension not present in the original's straight-forward presentations. All in all, if you liked the original you should most likely enjoy the sequel. Where many have disappointingly pointed out the lack of personality and indulgence of set action pieces that Dead Man's Chest sinks to in place of authentic and rousing pirate personalities prominently portrayed in Curse of the Black Pearl, I would argue that POTC:DMC knew what it was even more then it's predecessor, and for that created a more cohesive, engaging adventure that does well to set up anticipation for it's forthcoming last round.",6,0,0,3 December 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," High production values do not cancel out the mostly hollow affair
","This big budget swashbuckler reinstated Hollywood's interest in pirates, reaffirmed Johhny Depp as a bankable mainstream leading man, and refocused the industry with it's surprisingly high box office performance, followed by an even more surprising (though widely regarded as inferior) net gain from it's sequel. So why did I not have half the fun as I was anticipating with The Curse of the Black Pearl? Despite having all the key ingredients at making this rousing adventure come to life, Pirates still flounders with a repetitious script, an overkill of production, and of course the general disengaged, auto-piloted mentality that one immediately associates with any massive studio release. Yes, Depp's inspired take as the woozy captain Jack Sparrow does breathe some fresh air into the stale script, though his acting, more often then not, devolves into processed caricature rather then the engaged perceptiveness we are used to seeing from an accomplished actor such as Depp. Also, the casting of uber-talented Geoffry Rush did help break up much of the monotony the time-killing script wished to parlay. Ultimately though, these elevated Hollywood performances are buried under ten tons of sheen, smoke, and explosions that could only be appropriately titled 'The Bruckheimer effect' which finds the mega- producer, as usual, filling in any actual emotional content with a barrage of over-excessive special effects and action sequencing. Shame too, because with Depp at the helm, and the few scenes that show off the inherent humor, personality and flavor this franchise could have offered, it became obvious that this could have been so much more memorable then the hollow ride it turns out to be. As far as popcorn family entertainment goes, I can justify the massive amount of success the movie has reaped, although to elevate this movie past the point of good, into the realm of great, as many reviewers have done, seems well overrated, as I mostly spent my two and a half hours waiting for the resolution in this lackluster plot.",5,3,5,30 November 2006
12 Angry Men," The jury has reached a verdict
","This near perfect, post-courtroom exploration of the twelve jurors who were to decide one boy's fate is every bit deserving as accolades would suggest. A shot to my dying cinematic heart, this film's staggering focus took an involving legal story and brilliantly merged it with a complex and diverse character study, making 12 Angry Men one the most engaging ensemble works of American history. Packed almost entirely into one plain meeting room for deliberation, the simmering screenplay should keep anyone glued to their screen into the very last frame; tension like this is simply unavailable these days. Equally effective as a plot-deducing mystery and gripping morality play, the genius behind this legendary feature lies in a seamless combination of those two particularly strong traits.Delivering the film's highest ideals from page is an absolutely flawless group of men who are highly synergistic on top of their incredible individual takes. Though Henry Fonda will be remembered as the central character, the level of professionalism coming from the remaining 11 demands complete attention. Therefore singling anyone out would be a lost cause, except for studying the intricacies of any of the individually sublime roles. Some have characterizations that dwarf others, many take up less screen time then a few key players, but all in all the respect and generosity given to manifest each different personality is astounding and echoes the most transcendent aspects of dramatic form as we watch the mesmerizing layers of human consciousness become peeled away.Essentially it is that timeless and eloquent capturing of a man's mind on the brink of justice that will keep 12 Angry Men forever fresh in our hearts. A historical directing debut for Sidney Lumet proved that his years working in television were not in vain. Exquisitley shot, even many technical setbacks will do nothing to distract from this commanding work. From start to finish, the film is testament to singular creative glory, only slightly betrayed by an overplayed cathartic climax.",9,2,4,3 May 2007
Hostel," Slightly scary
","After letting myself get swept up in a bit of the hype this movie has amassed, I must confess I was quite let down. The true horror just isn't there..The movie has a few tense moments perhaps, but it all feels a little too Hollywood to truly infect that dark disturbed part of your brain, despite the film's blatant attempt to be there..Kind of sad really, because this could have been such a terrifying premise; imagine the results if executed by a more mature, less clichéd, foreign (sadly!) filmmaker..Would have truly made us Yanks stay out of Europe..Instead we essentially get a traditional Hollywood Horror film with a bit of a unique setting..For all of it's dilapidated and gritty 'realness' some of the scenes attempt to exemplify, the far fetched plot twists, and archetypal Hollywood heroism's water down an already merely amusing premise. A good scream for the younger set, I suppose.",5,0,0,18 April 2006
Elizabeth," Another mostly hollow production
","Nearly every bit the overblown soap opera as its sequel of ten years later, Cate Blanchett's first turn as the Queen of England already finds her impressive talent buried underneath lavish production.Shekhar Kapur is a good fit for directing the historical intrigue but too often finds himself swept up into the production values inherent in this rich period piece at the behest of filming actual character-based content.So mildly dull and partially melodramatic the entire proceedings feel, that Vincent Cassel nearly steals the show amongst this extremely classy cast by flaunting his dress-wearing zaniness for merely a few minutes.",5,1,2,5 February 2008
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Integrity melting away
","Cruder, duller incarnation of the animated family affair milks everything that was good about the original and offers little else but tasteless (at times subtly racist and sexist) jokes and uninspired mechanics as the gang return in order to basically escape their melting locale, as their frozen age nears it's evaporation. Aside from that darn squirrel's sheer rendered physicality, in one of animations legendary quests of acquisition (which also gets overused to compensate for the lazy story), average would seem almost polite when compared to the balanced and far classier and memorable original. Undoutedly there are enough fun moments and fan appeasement to ensure that this movie will meet the financial quotas they most likely are expected to make, although anyone expecting a repeat performance this time around may be disappointed. Still, with the obviously well rendered visuals, pervasive silliness, sprinkled with a few genuinely worthy scenes including musical interludes, this competent addition will serve it's purpose just fine to those it's intended for.",5,0,1,22 November 2006
Balls of Fury," Starts fun but ends tiring
","Admittedly, I have a bizarre connection to the sport of table tennis through family, and in such might have found some of the scenes disproportionately funny, but I do mean to stress only some scenes. Balls of Fury works as the cheesy ping-pong death match parody before it even enters it's clumsy showcase third act.In the meantime, obvious physical humor coupled with some well timed delivery, guided by an occasionally biting script (only in one-liners of course, as the overall script itself adds up to little more then that) from our friends of Reno 911 fame ensures a few well placed zings for multi-demographics. Low expectations may be key, but the movie should carry enough laughs to garner relatively successful reviews for the modest gig it is.",6,4,12,28 August 2007
Spider-Man 2," Emulates success of original too closely to feel authentic
","Using the successful template which guided part 1 to a tee, Sam Raimi again duplicated his blockbuster hit with even more box office bite, but in the process lost something along the way. There are no obvious downgrades from the previous installment, a fun, enduring origin piece that instantly sat well with so many outside the comic book norm. All key elements which became dependable in the franchise are present and multiplied: fluid action, romantic tension, and meaningful metaphors on the man behind the mask. Even though there is clearly an intended purpose to probe Parker's dualistic struggle, sermonizing his morality to an uncomfortable measure via a few extra corny interactions does not help a plot that parallels way too much from it's predecessor in the first place. This overdone approach will lend well to all intense sequencing but does somehow trample over the unique pleasure that was the first rather then totally compliment.Essentially, Spider-Man 2 is a glorified teaser for the impending trilogy, using much of it's time to simply set up a bigger showdown that is yet to come. Whereas the original offered an exciting, fun, and fresh update to the comic book superhero in and of itself, one can definitely sense the stench of sequelitis begin crawling in this time around. The primary cast begins to settle into their respective roles, perhaps a little too comfortably, while Raimi struggled to fill the movie with an admirable foe. Alfred Molina is a fine actor who wears his four robotic arm well as rogue scientist Doc Ock, but too many similarities between Dafoe's Green Goblin render this conflict predictable. James Franco, who remains a pivotal character to the series, simply does not bring any humanity to the role of Harry Osborn either, replacing any ongoing tension the sequel wishes to set up with a sourly frown to drive his character instead.The fans ate this one up, and it is easy to see why. All the action scenes are finely tuned and exhibit a sharper eye then the original could ever attempt. Spider-Man's webbing around New York City is still the selling point, and the CGI animators do everything in their power to justify a second indulgence with some fascinating fights, particularly when filmed at high speeds against an aesthetically adventurous Doc Ock. A certain dedication to examining Peter Parker as he struggles to reconcile with his alter-ego was also another reason fans held this one on a pedestal. But honestly, as much as the script may try to diverge into psychological subtext while offering insanely choreographed action, the impact still ended up feeling like an amped-up repeat of what made the first one so engaging.",6,0,1,2 May 2007
Black Book," EuroWood
","Decadently indulgent when romanticizing it's entertainment factor, Paul Verhoeven comes back from the abyss to present this mini-epic, showcasing an action-packed, erotically-charged, plot-twisting ride packaged as an adult spy thriller, taking place during the holocaust in Holland. As escapist entertainment the film should work wonders, especially for the adult female demographic that should particularly appreciate an intricate spy-thriller fused with a heated romanticism. Anyone trying to take this elaborate (for dutch standards) production for more then the classy popcorn muncher it is may have a hard time holding back the laughs however. In a demanding lead, Carice van Houten certainly does not bomb, though definitely lacks the charisma and depth to portray the elaborate characterization as it was written. Instead, (as the wise pairing of Verhoeven would suggest) Black Book becomes premier fluff; the rare semi-classy, though devoid of sincerity, mainstream entertainment which can be a guilty pleasure even for some film cynics. Of course such well constructed glossiness would be imported, despite America's death-grip on the form.",6,7,11,21 September 2007
Superbad," The new teen comedy to beat
","Fine comedic entry into the awkward teenage sex subgenre not only raises bars on portraying the realistic underpinnings of what it feels like to be confused, horny, and young in today's America, but also triumphantly parallels producer Judd Apatow's patented method of following up vulgarity with sincerity, tying it all around a day-in-the-life snapshot which further ensures cult demographic appreciation. Honestly, the movie may be worse off for how well rounded it was. Undoubtedly funniest in it's first act, Superbad becomes less personal and hilarious when the more plot-oriented, hi-jinks-ensuing second act, and tender third come into fruition. This isn't to say the material and great performances do not feel funny and fresh throughout. Merely it is to say that what could have been one of the funniest comedies to arrive in many, many moons trades in some superbly honed charm for a more emotionally satisfying and typically well-rounded experience.",7,0,2,3 December 2007
Hot Fuzz," Surprisingly overrated
","By no means a dud, Hot Fuzz tries a little too hard but does not necessarily capture all the magic that came with skewing zombie flicks. This time around the Wright/Pegg alliance dish out an overly long police parody and while there are still quite a lot of hits, the misses are there as well. Many of the jokes are not so much funny as they are intelligent, as has always been the plight of those damn smart Brits and their attempts at tickling our funny-bones.So, while you may find yourself with a consistently warped smirk across your face, indulging in all the tiny witticisms, mediocre (disguised as brilliant) comedic timing, and half-baked pop references, seldom do the rip-roaring laughs come fast and furious. All the excessive hyper-edits might have given this rural English laugher a fresh sheen but really did nothing to compliment the little hilarity present, and instead became a tad repetitious and distracting, as if the technical competency seemed over-excessive to disguise a lack of gut-busting material found in the script.Fans of the cult fave Shaun of the Dead will not question any of these inconsistencies for a second, gleefully eating it up with a knife and fork (as the thunderous chorus of hallowed praise for this film has indicated) but for those going in completely unbiased, exercise caution. Heck, it's not like we are flooded with quality comedies all the time, but Hot Fuzz certainly only felt lukewarm at best.",6,1,7,28 July 2007
Troy," Giganto-fetish clouds some of the more personal aspects of splendidly captured war
","Epic, mega-budget release directed by the respected Wolfgang Peterson effectively conveys all of the visual splendor and passion the infamous battle of Troy would have entailed. While the production values definitively register as top of the line, the movie almost seems obsessed with it's own grandeur to a fault. Peterson offers some of modern cinema's most spectacularly photographed battle scenes with the unreal flyovers and other various techniques used when creating the thousands of soldiers do battle, but somehow manages to drown out the amazing characters covered in this material taken from The Iliad. Surprisingly the much criticized Brad Pitt in the role of the worlds greatest warrior, Achilles, holds well, with his darkly sensual performance overriding any believability coming from such a small frame and pretty face. Other main characters also blend in well with the roles they were cast in, even the usually laughable Orlando Bloom had the perfect lover-boy/wuss role at his disposal so as to not completely shatter the involvement of the viewer trying to take this questionable cast seriously. Overall, Troy was an awesome sight to behold that lives up to the historical weight thrust upon this battle, although not without compromising some of the more character driven material in favor of wide-eyed, though repetitious battle scenes.",6,1,5,22 November 2006
Juno," Knocked Up meets Napolean Dynamite = eh
","Although Juno may be a front-runner for this year's celebrated independent film, this teen pregnancy yarn contains many of the same quirky letdowns that have become low-budget, dialog-heavy staples for over a decade. In a script littered with overdone wit, first timer Diablo Cody does demonstrate an occasional worthwhile perspective amongst the onslaught of girly cynicism's, but as it is, lead Ellen Page simply gives off a self-consciousness much too mature in her mannerisms, delivery, and speech, turning her into the opposite of the authentic character she is supposed to be. Most of the cast, especially the younger ones, feel slightly amateurish as well, surprisingly letting people like Jeniffer Garner steal away what slight thunder there is to be had. An uneventful follow-up to Jason Reitman's very solid Thank You for Smoking, the movie does hold few tender moments, many sarcastic ones, but rarely any truthful ones.",5,47,102,6 December 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Drowned by it's own storyline pride
","The third (hopefully final) film for Pirates of the Caribbean will attempt to be everything fans would hope for in a concluding trilogy, attempt being the key word here. Short of the few odd adult males attending in full pirate gear though, I am pretty sure most viewers ended up feeling At World's End's excessive running time. Appeasing die-hard fans (apparently there are more then we think) of the franchise to an exhausting degree, the film lumbers back and forth between various back-stabbings and double-crossings going on in Jack Sparrow's crew, all to tediously apathetic results. Likewise, the unnecessarily dense script tries too earnestly to explain all the hackneyed mythology brought up in the first two films and instead makes viewers care even less.As as result, At World's End is not nearly as pleasurable as the first two's narrative arc would indicate. Bogged down by the detail-oriented plot, casual moviegoers will hardly get most details introduced previously in the series, let alone retain interest in these relatively obscure elements. It seems as if scribes Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (both having written all three), realized the huge phenomenon Pirates had become, and spent their last screenplay vainly trying to justify all of the minor plot devices they thought viewers were interested in. They overvalued the specifics of this plot and in turn robbed the film of the one thing everybody loves; personality. Instead of letting characters breathe a little more on screen to make a lasting impression, At World's End spends a three hour run time ensuring viewers that every trite plot element from all three films will be given adequate closure.Faulting the cast and crew would be wrong; At World's End continues the impeccable production values and credible performances that initially set this ship off into our collective wallets. Here though, the over-bloated script just makes the over-boated set design even more frustrating. Once the film's obnoxiously extended and over-the-top finale is underway, the excitement leading up to that perilous showdown has all but been extinguished. The film will still do well in theaters and rightfully so; there is enough big-budget mayhem intercut throughout the epic bore to ensure seats will be filled. But Pirates 3 will remain in my eyes a quintessential warning to all potential popcorn franchises as to not take themselves too seriously, despite any success hinting to the contrary.",5,55,110,23 May 2007
X-Men," Competent, adequate, and best for fans
","Apt though dry first installation of the underdog comic franchise delivers fairly decent introductions into these comic heroes lives. The often stilted narratives delivered through mostly acceptable acting are thankfully offset by the practical yet glamorous nature of the special effects. Despite the tasteful implementation of effects, the direction of the action scenes often feel disconnected. Alongside the mechanical script, the film offers no real emotional connection to much of the fantasy, save a few human, comical moments. Instead of envisioning a movie, we have a comic book come to life. It is not terrible, but if you are not a fan of the comic books, do not expect to be captivated.",5,0,0,28 September 2006
Spider-Man 3," Technical proficiency will amend a disjointed plot
","Continuing this franchise like clockwork, Sam Raimi again starts off just like the others with Tobey Maguire beginning his introduction monologue. Fulfilling it's obligatory requirements in spades, Spider-Man 3 continues to provide enough action, romance, drama, and comedy to justify another family outing. This time around though, mostly in place of a steady narrative lies the littered extracts of multiple threads tied together. In place of one encompassing conflict, the compacted screenplay attempts to mold no less then three of Spider-Man's enemies into this action extravaganza. For better or worse this will make or break the film for fans. Different concentration on Spidey's multiple adversaries lends well to keeping a diverse set of cutting edge fight sequences on hand, probably outshining any of the visceral memories from the last two films. But in fragmenting his attention amongst the different villains, Raimi (who this time was actually involved in writing the script) never really brings a worthwhile conflict to the fore, instead indulging crowds with an assortment of spectacular though mostly insignificant brawls. The technology behind capturing these heated battles has obviously never been better, as always there are plenty of moments that beg to be witnessed on a theater screen, but the overall impression is a bunch of fabulous, adrenaline pumping scenes that do not add up to cohesive whole.Still, it may be for that very indulgence that the film is as successful as it will most likely be. Whereas in the past I felt perhaps too much time was spent on completely clichéd wisdom, taking Parker's struggles to an unnecessary pulpit of sorts, this time around the heavy-handed dialog seemed toned down a bit, more in touch with web-slinging roots that dominate the visuals. Yes, there is another trial Parker must face within himself as he continues to identify the real person he thinks he is, but this time psychological undertones do not drown out Spider-Man's intended purpose, which would be to dazzle.And dazzle it does, cutting through much of the generic repetition with some of the finest CGI technical work to date. Exemplifying the quality design this team has become known for, right from the start it is apparent the action will definitely be trying to one-up some tough predecessors. From the film's first breakneck action sequence, Raimi shows his phenomenal talent for directing at high speeds, and puts forth some truly exciting chases. Along with Maguire's newfound pleasure in taking this little walk to the dark side, lies the heart and soul of another box office smash. Raimi is just able to ink out another worthwhile story from these mostly reused elements between spectacular confrontations, fittingly ending this trilogy on an appropriate, if obvious note. One does wonder what he will have left to say, if rumors hold true and Spider-Man is given a second trio of films; most characters just feel used up from this point out.",6,2,5,4 May 2007
Match Point," Good, not great romantic mystery devoid of Allen's signature
","I must agree with the smaller consensus in regards to some of the lavish praise that has been heaped onto this movie as being way overstated. My local paper's critic basically attributed this fact to it being Woody Allen's best in a little while, when his career has been in decline at least ten years. The fact that Allen had produced some kind of resonance within the film community at long last could have been the only reason audiences were on their feet at Cannes when it premiered, she went on to guess, and I must say I agree. Match Point is a very competent film, which does keep viewers pretty compelled throughout with it's involving story. For the first time though, I truly cannot see any trace of the writer/director in his script or direction. Obviously, Allen needed to do a little reinventing with his movies becoming more and more irrelevant in this modern age, but opting to basically sever his unique persona that has radiated everything I have seen by him was not the most assured decision of one of our most illustrious filmmakers. It will keep him in the limelight a little longer though.",6,0,0,26 April 2006
Zodiac," Bogged down thriller misses out on atmosphere due to 'facts'
","Disappointingly rote, a numbing excess to this strenuously factual crime drama, relaying mysterious events surrounding a decade-long search for California's Zodiac killer, proves opposite of the engaging, palpable thriller it aspires to. What could have been one of the more solid serial killer/police dramas to emerge in the past few years instead becomes a repetitious detective procedural, coming across like the non-fiction book it is based on, but without any of it's intended cinematic flair. Instead of seizing this moment to bring viewers back into the dangerously seductive cat-and-mouse direction that gave Se7en it's urgent heart, David Fincher opts to walk the straight and narrow here, rarely even taking much artistic license to tell the potentially engrossing story. Here moviegoers are walked through the entire epic investigation, portraying all sides involved in a mostly documented manner.Admirable in it's objective ambitions, Fincher largely misses the entire point of making a movie like this for the silver screen and instead bogs the viewer down with unnecessary minutia; information that is certainly relevant to the plot's hunt for this elusive killer, but nonetheless will become entirely formulaic, leaving many viewers apathetic way too quickly. Perhaps if the ultra-objective script had it's actors trying to dress up some of the boring details they would have kept interest longer, but impressions during this lengthy film will sadly veer from cold to dull way too quickly and rarely come back to anything else. Any nuance evoked from a decent cast is immediately swept aside in favor of another bureaucratic endeavor.Presenting the majority of developments in methodical, underwhelming snippets which belie any attempts at fluidity from the acting and directing department, the film begins to feel so detached, the irony of Zodiac becoming less involving the more information is revealed becomes prevalent. As an analysis of the legally inept cross-communications which plague law enforcement, a scope remains unfulfilled, making it difficult to justify much of the intent here. Certainly not a complete failure, Zodiac remains faithful to facts of this case to a fault, rarely touching upon the haunting period qualities the movie could have so effortlessly offered, seeing greater results.",5,18,41,2 March 2007
The Prestige," Nearly as flawed as it is amazing
","Vastly entertaining period piece, centered around the rivalry between two magicians desperate to one-up each other, could have been one of the greatest mainstream riddlers to come along in some time. Instead, The Prestige tries so desperately to be the mind-melt it is envisioned as that the constant surprises feel suspiciously rote, character motivation feeling surprisingly laughable. Clearly, the Nolan brothers' dense script wished to outdo themselves, perhaps a tad overambitious coming from minds that produced the solid, compelling, deliciously confusing Memento.Here, crazy turn of events run like clockwork, authenticity comes and goes depending on the scene, and viewers foolishly witness a plot inside a vacuum that does not contrast any sort of real world interaction with the magic-centric scenario. All this makes the enjoyable twists and turns that Christopher Nolan employs throughout the introspective romp feel slightly less impacting then they should have, at times even coming across as laughably ridiculous; which is a shame really, since this original cat and mouse tale still ends up being something quite special. Banking on heavy replay value through inherent ambiguities that further enhance the mystery's shelf life, there is still an admirable amount of rational explanation to justify the increasingly unbelievable and enjoyable pace that will continue to indulge throwing viewers out of the loop if they do not, as illusionist Alfred Borden insists 'pay attention'. The brief narration may feel slightly condescending by basking in the art of it's own clever twists, but if someone had to be pretentious about the intricate script they have crafted, I am glad it is these guys. I just wished they would have spent a little more time fine tuning some of the individual scenes, since their ambitions often seemed to exceed a hard pressed wow factor. Cast-wise, the always hard working Christian Bale seems to be the only one that truly owned his character in the period it was meant to take place. Hugh Jackman usually felt way too modernized, and the A-list supporting cast felt out of place, almost superfluous. Even Michael Caine, one of our oldest and most respected working actors around, here in a role that is written as the glue to hold all of these wild themes together, feels unnecessary and forced most of the time. All in all though, The Prestige is a treat, overcoming the awkward setup to seduce viewers into caring about this most irrelevant of fictitious rivalries with compelling, creative force by the time the stage curtain has lowered.",6,0,1,18 February 2007
Silent Hill," Silent Thrills
","Visually, this video game adaptation is spot on at recreating the eerie, detailed stillness and psychological atmosphere associated with this long forgotten ghost town of Silent Hill. Fans of the cult franchise will not be disappointed at the near perfection of recreating some of the morbidly surreal horror fantasy scenes, inspired primarily from the games first installment, ultimately confirming the real star here is the set design. Unfortunately, eerie atmospherics a substantial movie does not make, and like every other video game movie before it (just in a slightly less obvious, better produced way) this port to film is somehow lost in translation. Written by Roger Avary of Pulp Fiction fame, the primary focus on milking everything from the franchise that is visually compelling ends up overpowering the weak plot. Instead of getting a unique storyline to match the unique visuals, the script offers something of a rehashed synopsis of the game's history, which by the time the uninteresting supporting cast predictably relays, most non-fans will likely be too apathetic to care about.",5,0,1,19 August 2006
Once," Solid reworking of the song-intensive film
","As a musical film Once does wonders to reinvigorate the genre with some much needed realism and urgency. This effect is in no small part due to the faux documentary style breathing staying power into an already well composed Damien Rice-esquire soundtrack. The two lead characters are thoroughly convincing as a pair of struggling souls, trying to make ends meet, who happen to cross paths in a most ordinary and unassuming way. Though the script certainly will not garner any praise (minimal though it may be, subtitles may be required through thick Irish accents), a bittersweet longing, albeit of the mildly shallow variety, does prevail as the overwhelming spirit of this convincing and soulful songwriting romance.",7,3,4,14 December 2007
Scary Movie 2," Dim witted straight laced offspring still good for a few rips
","Disappointing sequel spoofing mainly The Haunting does not reach the craziness of the original nor does it really take advantage of it's haunted house scenario. As with all of these Scary Movies, certain scenes do warrant the viewing due to the hilarious timing, but where the original thrived off of it's lewd sexual and toilet antics, the second edition merely revisits some of the tired jokes, and when those are not in place, the straight forward scooby doo style will surly doo one in. Thankfully comic brains David Cross and Tim Curry come to class up the juvenile cast, but cannot save, or even attempt to save this very questionable possibility even for rental.",4,0,1,12 August 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Not a masterpiece, but a master of pieces
","An intriguing mixture of fantasy and period drama, this curious hybrid moves along wonderfully but seems a tad overrated in my book, perhaps due to a lavish praise being heaped upon the very concept itself, which may ignore some of the smaller lulls that weigh down the film a bit. By no means slow-paced or uninspired, Pan's Labyrinth still flounders slightly with it's somewhat forced contrasts in brutality and magic.Everyone has been praising writer/director Guillermo del Toro's visionary tactics enabling the film to walk a fine line between the stark, fascist violence that exists in the 1944 Spanish villa owned by a tyrannical general, and the surreal, escapist world the general's soon to be daughter wields as her defensive mechanism in coping with her depressed reality. Slipping further and further into the backyard woods that eventually becomes the visually intensive labyrinth of discussion, del Toro does create a fascinating parallel world, but in contrasting the two, becomes a little more tedious then I was led to believe. Young Ofelia's various 'quests', through which the fantasy arc takes root, are visually inventive but do not make for much of a convincing narrative, mostly feeling pieced together instead of a cohesive adventure. Despite the rigorous attention to set design which complement the original creatures, the contrasting world of reality appears littered with stereotypes and a stifled predictability.While I would not call this all important contrasting of realities underutilized, I also would certainly not call it completely adept; Del Toro has moved away from the adolescent joys of previous work, but still has a little to go before making a certifiable masterwork. Still, the overwhelming technical proficiency demonstrated mostly in the engrossing fantasy sequences prove to flesh out a further emotional and mental statement that help make Pan's Labyrinth one of the more mature and critically acclaimed fantasy films to come along in years.",6,3,7,24 January 2007
Knocked Up," Judd Apatow continues to improve his distinct style with the most consistent comedy of the season
","From the hilarious writer-director-oddball Judd Apatow, Knocked Up one-ups even his extremely well received 40 Year Old Virgin. And just like last year's funniest surprise hit, his latest release seems destined to repeat the same critically and commercially successful process. Apatow continues to triumph, like few working American filmmakers today, by merging vulgarity with sincerity into equally hilarious and heartfelt results. In detailing the warped and awkwardly circumstantial paining of Seth Rogen's quintessential slacker and Katherine Heigl's ambitious businesswoman (both casted well), Apatow's trademark bittersweet dynamics get to shine brighter even then anything we have previously seen.What works so well for the film, besides it's constant and perceptive humor, is how well both sexes are covered in this gross-out comedy with heart. If The 40 Year Old Virgin was a great comedy with romantic intentions, Knocked Up is a romantic movie with comedic intentions. Despite his preoccupation with bodily gags and stereotypical stoners, Apatow has truly been refining the emotional content of his characters, coming up with two people who are a pleasure to invest into the relationship despite a plethora of disgusting toilet humor emanating from much of the dialog.What results is a movie that functions nearly as well as an offbeat chick flick or the masterful comedy that it is. The screenplay may push a little too hard with crude sexual references at times, though it often compliments the heavier romantic qualities splendidly. Of course the plot will have it's fair share of unrealistic qualities (even if Apatow does vividly capture some very real qualities from the demographic he writes about he still struggles with the female psyche), and some may resent Apatow's continuous decision to load his last act up with a heavier dosage of drama then the overall tone would suggest, but line for line Knocked Up is surely the funniest script to emerge on the big screen this year, and this year's champion of the one-liner zing.",7,2,5,1 June 2007
Blades of Glory," Covers it's comedic niche with about as little effort as possible but still provides a few memorable laughs
","Not being a huge fan of Will Ferrell's overdone antics, my expectations were at a humbled minimum upon viewing the latest showcase for his repetitious, though always smart comedic offerings. Surprisingly, the bland and undercooked laugher dealing with two silly men figure skating as a pair, barely managed to appease even my lowest predictions. Playing out like yet another halfway developed, openly lazy, SNL-sketch-launched-to-big-screen, the little laughter Ferrell can muster does not save the majority of lifeless chuckles that miss the humor mark. Often I found myself dispelling air in a way that sort of prompts the psyche for belly laughs, but hardly being able to follow through. All these insincere, mere formalities of dispirited chuckling may have indicated a uniform cleverness throughout the lame plot's dialog, but rarely rises to the level of hilarity a good comedy is supposed to provide. Only near the end, in the actual skating routines does the humor excel at invigorating the crowd, while a majority of the scenes beforehand demonstrate an under-rehearsed duo largely forsaking any synergy the script had called for between the two flamboyant leads.Credit the continual and baffling casting of Jon Heder in these lead comedic roles as one of the chief reasons much of the laughter rarely lifts off the ground. Ever since landing the iconic role in Napolean Dynamite, to which he played to a tee, producers have made the mistake in thinking Heder can actually act outside of the narrow dork he so readily defined in that indie smash hit, and every big budget comedy that has cast him in a primary role since has suffered for it. While not necessarily a poor casting choice to have him playing the uber-fairy skater Jimmy MacElroy, Heder simply cannot rise above his trite delivery to provide any sort of edgy humor in any scenes, that responsibility falls squarely on Mr. Will.Though admirably keeping any witty vulgarity flowing naturally as the macho, sex-addicted, drug-using figure skater, Ferrell's character feels too recycled from random other characters he's portrayed to create much of a genuine funniness, a far-cry from his more involved work with partner Adam Mckay (the more creatively average Talladega Nights). In the end the king of offbeat one liners and the charisma-less ultra dork are oddly enough upstaged by relative newcomer and gifted sideman Nick Swardson in an inspired and perceptive take on the stalking psychopath, demonstrating a hunger for comedic delivery that is all but noticeable throughout the majority of mediocrity.",5,6,17,30 March 2007
Nacho Libre," Jared Hess + Jack Black = Comedic integrity
","Though this silly, lighthearted comedy was laughed off by many as juvenile fare, beneath the surface of this Mexican wrestling spoof lies a wholly original, uniquely charming, even humbly visionary tale that sees an evolution for Napolean Dynamite's breakout director Jared Hess. The off-kilter pace that became tremendously popular with that surprise hit now receives a more refined, more calibrated treatment, proving that the massive cult hit was indeed justified. Whereas Napolean felt uneven, at times unfocused, ultimately wearing it's quirk like a badge of honor, Nacho takes all the eccentric qualities inherent with Hess and tunes them to a weirdly fulfilled whole. Of course this movie would not have been half as impressionable had it not been for the comedic talents of Mr. Jack Black. Also exercising atypically unique restraint for a comedic film, Black paints the memorable caricature of confused spiritual wrestler in subtle washes of joy, allowing his usual overly-obnoxious antics to take a back seat for some of his more perceptive comedic ramblings. While his Mexican accent can clearly be seen veering all over the place, it is all in the spirit of this playful farce. The laughs may not come every second, but the cleverness and stylistic triumph stay sealed throughout. What also helps make the movie work so well is how everything is so entrenched in little known Mexican wrestling/religious culture, so that every scene radiates such unique warmth. While this admirable loyalty to source material makes for one of the more unique comedies of the year, perhaps it is that very loyalty that also helped alienate many moviegoers, seemingly perplexed by the amount of effort given to cover such a niche demographic. It is true, perhaps if you are of Spanish decent, lived in Mexico, or follow old school 'Luchador' wrestling this might be more appealing, but given the small but hardcore following this movie has already amassed, I'd say it's safe to bet that anyone with an open mind for comedy would immediately be drawn to repeated viewings of this extremely independent release.",8,1,3,19 December 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Overrated but mildly worthwhile
","A somewhat entertaining morality drama of the Hollywood variety, this baby doesn't really get going until the convoluted first and second acts are played out, culminating in a more emotionally involving conclusion. Speckled with much homegrown Bah-stonian flavor, the newfound directorial talents of big bro Ben Affleck to portray the city he loves with a notion of gritty integrity perhaps overwhelms with some shiftily stereotypical minor characters- both in look and delivery, but the core cast remain strong enough to let the overcooked plot come to a gentle simmer when we finally are able to understand what all the messy details add up to. The result is certainly far shy of the riveting, infinitely ponderous conclusion some have suggested, but still absolutely enough to make for a decent night of serious entertainment for mainstream American audiences.",6,11,17,13 January 2008
American Psycho," Admirable combination of laughs and fears
","Impressive adaptation of the brutal satire detailing early 90's yuppie excess, Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel comes to sparkling life with equal measures of hilarity and depravity. In ripping the often referenced book for a cinematic reincarnation, director Mary Harron certainly had her work cut out for her. Substituting some of the unbearably graphic images which would fester inside readers heads for a more suggestive style, Harmon brilliantly recreates this hard-edged satire for the silver screen with very few discrepancies.Thriving off of the psychotically committed effort from lead Christian Bale, American Psycho might not be as bluntly effective as some of it's harsher passages would beckon, but nonetheless remains one of modern Hollywood's most brilliant and scorching satires on the materialistic excess plaguing the late 80's early 90's for many ambitious Americans. It is that memorable time period that is captured so convincingly amidst Bateman's psychotic urges that makes the film larger then it's subject. Many will classify American Psycho as a horror film on the warped mindset behind a serial killer, though it becomes clear by film's end that a sharply cutting comedic commentary on those highly egotistical years play more of a role in describing what makes this violent and sadistic man tick then expected.In turn, American Psycho becomes a glorious dark comedy, even if a little repetitious, whilst Bale continues to terrify audiences with his disturbingly perfect portrait. It is a character definitely prone to caricature, completely convincing in the rare evil silences we witness when Bales becomes engulfed in his struggling darkness, which viewers will, upon further viewings, analyze further due to an ambiguous ending. Though short of the character study masterpiece I had ideally hoped for, the film will remain a nihilistic joy with stinging psychological sentiment for years to come.",7,0,1,10 May 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Some familiar trappings still can't tarnish the sunshine
","Taking the current crown for dysfunctional family ensemble work, Little Miss Sunshine is the most warped fun you will have with an eccentric clan since Family Stone or The Squid and the Whale. A little more predictable then the latter, slightly less naturally paced then the former, LMS still manages to be morbidly sweet in it's stereotypically indie manner. Following the exploits of the bitter unit, we are invited along for a road trip that will take this extended family 800 miles across the country in order to enroll their youngest daughter into a child beauty contest, essentially portrayed as a final bastion of hope for the ailing camaraderie between the members. Modeled, perhaps a little too closely, after the classic first National Lampoon's Vacation movie, Little Miss does sometimes suffer from these parallels as well as the predictability that all of these fractured personalities bring to the table. To see the fine cast working together to create this completely modern portrait of family though nearly compensates for any of the generic trappings the concluding part of the script might have succumbed to. Anyone in the mood for a dark comedy with it's fair share of heart will be far too entertained to point out the few but obvious flaws that forbid this movie from becoming another true inept family classic; the bus is leaving-get on in.",7,3,8,20 December 2006
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Another unique, but still generic niche piece benefits from musical context
","Although comedic ringleader Judd Apatow keeps inching further and further away from doing what he does best, opting instead to propel his line of talent into a brand name of sorts, he does show up now and again with some of the better gags (in a mostly underwhelming and self-conscious screenplay) throughout the rock-bio, high concept prank Walk Hard. Some of the music movie jabs may rub fans the wrong way for being a bit crude or distasteful, but for every third half-cooked rock clichÃ© parody the movie shamelessly exploits, one clever and unique joke rears it's head to keep seasoned comedy fans and music-heads interested.In what might be quintessential 'friend of' John C. Reilly's first headlining gig since his lead in Paul Thomas Anderson's relatively obscure debut Hard Eight, casting proves competent at least. When the repetitious, shallow Saturday Night Live extended sketch (complete with obligatory multiple cast members)vibe starts to sink in, at least a brisk, mock-epic pace laced with impressively produced, silly pseudo-songs make this walk worth taking once.",6,6,20,21 December 2007
Dreamgirls," Does what it set out to do, but didn't let us know ahead of time
","The latest musical to woo Hollywood came as this soul singing period piece, based off a Broadway production chronicling a decade of conflict revolving around these three 'Dreamgirls' and their management. Judged strictly on the strength of this film being classified as a musical, the rambunctiously long parade still gets a passing grade. At times these songs feel unwarranted, excessive, repetitious and showy, but there is still no denying the laborious arrangements behind them to guide this trio along with audience delight. Possibly the true underdogs in this project (all music composed and played by band The Underdogs), these heavily crafted showpieces may reek of excessive production, but are one of the only things that maintain interest the whole way through.Another credit to the Dreamgirls success story, primarily responsible for crafting this illusion of seeming better then it actually is, belongs to adapter/director Bill Condon, definitely in over his head with pulling off the project with complete respectability, but nevertheless guiding the proceedings with an impressively skilled hand. It is his eye that makes so much of the glitzy treatment present here not seem trashy, his pace that keeps things fun, even when they are not. I applaud artists who like to immerse themselves into completely opposite works (as Condon's progression from Kinsey would indicate) but it is clear that a theater rendition on top of his Hollywood treatment makes for an empty gesture when it comes to the important element of character development here. Focus on so many shiny vocal routines leaves little time to have these figures become realized, leaving viewers with a barrage of sing-along material in place of the actual drama these lyrics are signifying.Which makes it hard to praise Dreamgirls as the rightly praised, reasonably well made music film it is; simple mis-marketing did not make most people aware that instead of this being a film with music, it is a musical with film. At times it felt the entire project was confused about this identity crises, awkwardly sliding in and out of melodic passages with no real intuition guiding the rhythm... And then there are brave exceptions to that rule, primarily shown in some of Jennifer Hudson's more powerful moments. The former, and bitter, American Idol contestant surprised all by stealing away everyones thunder with her diva-like antics and piercing vocals. There are a few instances in which she is shown literally ripping out her soul via the singing form, which truly does make for the few touching moments that outweigh a lot of hit and miss material, but her Oscar nomination and subsequent win only goes to show how desperate Hollywood is for genuine emotion. Hudson may bring an authenticity and undeniable soulfulness to the role, but to grace her with acting accolades sends out the wrong message to all those invested in the craft. Regardless of that irrelative rant, all those in favor of the next power-pumped shot of hummable celluloid say I to Dreamgirls, but if you are expecting this music to be a framing around which the story is told, you got it backwards.",6,0,1,26 April 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Turns vulgarity into sincerity
","Humorously enlightened work from perceptive scribe Apatow, guided by the current master of comedic subtleties, Steve Carell. The lead displays such a knack for inner monologue, albeit it in an overtly comedic way, that he will literally take you to that freshman year place of discomfort that applies to the Andy in all of us. People who are simply too cool, or cold, to know Andy's plight have 3 or 4 excellently fleshed out supporting characters to relate to, ranging the gamut from pot head writer, to playa wannabe- letting everyone, at least every American male, feel engaged dealing with the movie's situations. This movie somehow manages to have the dirtiness of an adult American pie, yet somehow elevates this material to heartfelt sincerity, no small feet indeed. At times the improv heavy scenes could be trimmed a little, especially on the unrated extended version, but if anyone knows how to kill awkward space with even more awkwardness it is Mr Carell.",7,1,2,19 May 2006
Spider-Man," Superman for todays crowd
","Delivering nearly all the blockbuster potential it held, Spider-Man burst onto the public consciousness in 2002, surpassing even the most generous sales expectation to become one of modern cinemas highest grossing films. Basically a catalyst behind the never ending glut of comic book franchises today, the movie proved to be an extremely agreeable update of essentially the same qualities which made Superman just as endearing in the old days. Borrowing a little heavily from that prototype, as is the original Stan Lee based comic, lies the same geeky alter ego who works at a newspaper while pursuing crime and the girl he loves in secret. Nothing really strays too far from that quintessential superhero lore, but if anything, puts it all in one very entertaining and accessible package for all shapes and sizes to enjoy.Part of the winning strategy behind this success story was the smart idea of putting veteran gore hound Sam Raimi on the case. Raimi was a fixture with 80's cult horror, providing the wonderfully crazed Evil Dead series amongst other demented fare. Having graduated with flying colors from the clutches of low budget horror, Raimi went on to direct more standard Hollywood fare, but it was the great stroke of casting him as director of this franchise that really made him a household name to middle America. Whoever knew that Raimi would be the right man for the job must have known what they were doing, for there was hardly a hint he would be capable of sustaining this kid-friendly, adult-entertaining film while retaining the integrity of the original comic books which it's based upon, though after a few frames of this easy to swallow comic adventure it becomes clear he was ideal. Raimi walks a fine line between Marvel geekdom and general audience appeasement, crafting a balanced piece of work that should appeal to a surprisingly large and varied demographic.The action is intense but bloodless, conveying the painful struggles Spider-Man endures facing his enemies, but never making the violence mean spirited so a younger crowd may enjoy as well. The much touted CGI effects still retain a wondrous sense of physicality five years later, articulating the most romanticized superhero homage since the original man of steel whenever the camera takes flight with Peter Parker. Spidey himself could not have been better cast; Tobey Maguire silenced nearly all critics with his powerfully introverted but accessible performance, filling out plenty of shiny sequences with a greater sense of depth then the genre usually provides. J.K. Simmons offers some wonderfully crafted comic relief in a brief supporting role, but Willem Dafoe oversteps a cartoonish boundary when portraying murderous alter-ego Green Goblin.All in all, a triumphant accomplishment for this team, worthy of the big interest it initially received due to Raimi's winning approach. Spider-Man still suffers from many of your typical Hollywood clichÃ©s, especially if one still holds the fossilized Superman franchise in high regard, but there seems to be enough passion coming from nearly all involved to take the crown as current champ of superhero productions.",7,0,1,29 April 2007
Ratatouille," Original, involving, warm, and beautiful to look at obviously
","Pixar find themselves back on track after the slight misfire that was Cars, only stumbling a bit when introducing characters in the first twenty minutes. Afterwards, a joyous reverence for American computer animation's most prestigious unit became more and more apparent as viewers are led down this unique, heartfelt journey of one rodent's love for making tasty food the talk of all Paris. As downright preposterous some of the plot elements revolve around seem nearly everything works splendidly, from the inspired physics of Pixar's patently breathtaking chase scenes, comedic brilliance in a snobbish maturity of the antagonists, to the splendidly and poignantly captured climax. Ratatouille, if not the company's best work to date, represents a newfound creative realization for what is still hopefully only the beginning of these titan's computerized expressionism.",8,1,3,2 November 2007
Saw III," Seen
","While some people are calling this gore flick the best of the three, I would have to say the opposite. Saw III has neither the plotted suspense of it's original nor the fast paced bloodletting of the amped up predecessor- yet the film plays like a half-assed amalgam of both. I can imagine hardcore fans of the morbid franchise or people who have never seen a Saw deriving the most pleasure out of this latest mechanized entry. Fans will eat up any bone these practical jokers (screenwriters) throw whilst trying to provide some sort of deadly scenario, usually giving way to an inordinate number of flashbacks, all in the name of allowing the franchise's sole saving grace (The blissfully creepy Tobin Bell) opportunity to chew the little scenery his tired ass can. Likewise, those who have never indulged in the current heavyweight champ of box office masochism may find a squeamishly fun time, guided by endless twists and brutally unique gore. For all those that fall into that third group which have seen these previous entries and are not die-hard fans (and over 20) will probably have a hard time swallowing this rushed, misdirected cash in on the silly little craze that was once unique, graphic, and entertaining but now merely feels monotonous, cheap, and exploitive. Desperately trying to weave an ambitious narrative to help explain some of this sorry excuse for a trilogy, the movie instead comes across as a convoluted hodge-podge of throw away ideas, weakly connecting the over-the-top and less frightening set piece death traps, with all the personality and character development of a soap opera.",4,2,3,22 January 2007
Ocean's Eleven," A classy guilty pleasure
","Worthy remake of the famous rat pack caper found a whole new pack taking over from Sinatra and the boys with Steven Soderbergh at the helm. Oceans Eleven is a glitzy, snazzy, and most importantly, fun recreation of the classic bank robbery film. The production value alone keeps everything shimmering along quite nicely, but it is the first rate cast, directed through Soderbergh's experienced lens that takes the infectiously entertaining piece over the top.In less skilled hands the film still would have been a fun, if unnecessary comedy caper diversion, but with this cast and crew becomes one of the most easily digestible and classy pieces of adult fluff entertainment to emerge post-millennium. Sure, the smug ensemble cast tends to wear a little thin after a while, but they are directed in such an entertainingly concise way that their indulgences become our own. Whatever doubt one may cast in the face of so many Hollywood A-listers gathered together to competitively mug the camera becomes cast aside after realizing how smooth the direction really is.Deceptively elegant, the Las Vegas cinematography compliments Soderbergh's smooth transitions perfectly. For all the late-game revelations that joyously unfold as the robbery occurs, the director really got to shine leading up to that elaborate heist. It is in the seductive filming of this outlandish proposal that elevates the crime comedy to a level of class film of this caliber rarely achieves present day.",7,3,7,26 May 2007
No Country for Old Men," Reinvigoritaed brothers rescue Hollywood, nobody notices
","Joel and Ethan Coen return to form after a few less then spectacular 'lighter' outings with this lavish, tense, expertly directed cat-and-mouse thriller which transitions, perhaps too awkwardly, into something quite different in the end.Regardless of a conflicted conclusion (undoubtedly difficult to transition from paperback roots), there are many thoughtfully captured(in no small part aided by Javier Bardem's scene-stealing, warped charisma) action sequences throughout which should elevate No Country above so much faux-visionary b.s. cinephiles desperately search through when compiling scenes to memory; motion that matters.Of course Hollywood is run in such an ass-backwards manner (so seems the taste of a paying general public majority, in fairness) that we will have one of America's most compelling cinematic experiences in years shown in as few theaters as possible. Any true fan of the craft should unfortunately make the lengthy trip.",7,5,16,13 November 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Too self-important to truly shine but definitely worth a rental
","This artsy, extended western does feel somewhat over-labored, indulging heavily in subplot and lengthy, actorly pauses without having enough backbone to do so, before finally finding it's footing over halfway through. Andrew Dominik is someone to look out for in the future with his noticeable sophomore release, offering a contemplative, slow-burning alternative to most westerns, guided by some impressive cinematography and airtight production.While much has been made of Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford, it really seems to be more about him simply stepping up to play a larger role in general. He hangs around with an admirable supporting cast and does not appear too out of place, but I really couldn't call his, or any of the chief performances outstanding. Brad Pitt continues to refine the obviousness of what made him successful, but even as the rugged and roughed up centerpiece he feels awfully lightweight in certain instances.If viewers are patient enough to sit through the less-involving first half of this lengthy piece with some curiosity then it just might transition from this pseudo-authentic, slightly homoerotic shoot into something a tad deeper on the nature of celebrity.",6,7,12,30 January 2008
28 Days Later...," One of Horror's most artistically ambitious films struggles to resolve itself
","The thinking man's zombie flick 28 Days Later, at it's best a frighteningly stylish British apocalypse, though at it's worst a technically overwrought stew of disjointed action and theme, nevertheless accomplishes elevating the horror genre to inspired new levels. With a strong first half, director Danny Boyle capitalizes on being an outsider to the zombie genre, shown by his evocative capturing of England through the eyes of one just waking up to this future-less nightmare(Cillian Murphy). Boyle takes this tried and true end-of-the-world scenario and instills a new artistic integrity into the carnage. Capturing the British landscape in such a desolate manner paid off in making this film something far more memorable then any plot specifics could. The eerie, vast stillness that serves as the film's superior first act will eventually become sidetracked by a confused, action-intensive finale, but during this awkward transition Boyle does not forget to maintain a psychological edge to parallel the progressive decay.Essentially split in two distinct movements, the action-packed showdown does not live up to the first half's sensually broadcast set design. Boyle and writing partner Alex Garland are to be commended for turning a horror found inside these enraged zombies unto ourselves for analysis, but in their overwrought hyper-kinetic style and morality logistics, manage to make the overall experience feel duller then the gorgeous setup would suggest.Whatever setbacks the cluttered second half demonstrate, it still only robs a uniquely great scary movie from being brilliant. How Boyle technically captures the infected (sped-up and annoyingly visceral) becomes more distracting then helpful, which a devolved but thematically viable climax attests to, but with the last lingering frame of haunting ambiguity, one remains in awe of this elevated fright-fest. Certainly one of the few zombie-type films that will ever grace a certain demographic's appreciation, and in that alone an instant triumph for Danny Boyle which continues to prove his adept range as a filmmaker.",7,0,1,8 May 2007
Cars," Continues the visionary dominance, though falters slightly with pace
","Needless to say, all the visionary spectacle that has guided Pixar's hand from day one remains brilliantly on display, articulated in new ways now that vehicles have become the human element. While not the masterpiece in tone and plotting that had distinguished this computer animation company's nearly flawless track record from countless imitators, Cars is nonetheless another heartfelt, beautiful triumph worthy of the Pixar label. As with all things animated, Cars works best when the action speaks for itself, when the animation suspends character interaction in favor of broad and breathtaking observational sweeps, via the American highway, poignantly harking back to days of old in completely new family-friendly gestures. While the humbling of hot-rod hot-shot Lightning Mcqueen (Wilson in one of his most convincing roles) and subsequent homage to mid west America may not have been pieced together in the most convincing of manners, Cars will still sweep excited children into it's blazing introduction, mellow out with it's sweet and funny character interaction and race past the finish line in a blaze of feel good family entertainment from the highest, visually animated order.",6,3,5,6 November 2006
Ghost Rider," Only effect that was special was the special effects
","Serviceable comic book translation gets by on unique, well implemented computer animation, but cannot rise above it's underwhelming plot line, mechanical pacing, and wooden performances despite a reasonable enough attempt to make this superhero action film more fun and accessible then most of it's ilk. The Marvel-based, skull-burning character finds his script adaptation feeling methodically predictable even to non-fans, despite the special Gothic and Texan flavor that tries, unsuccessfully, to pull the movie further away from it's generic trappings. Playing out a little too unintentionally comical at times, Ghost Rider's action sequences nonetheless provide the only distraction from the not-so-great acting, of course fronted by Nicolas Cage's overdone, ego-driven theatrics. While a few of these blazingly violent and vibrant physical scenes seemingly indulge the opposite in essence of our freakishly looking, damned soul of an antihero to a silly degree, on the whole this movie is saved from an irredeemable pit of tedium by the always reliable and ever increasing detailed effects design, which stands out from many standard comic book approaches, often implemented with thoughtful, sharp focus. The visceral heart of these effect sequences may not be enough to justify a viewing from anyone who is not already a fan of this stuff, but it will be enough to pump up a general audience with it's hell-on-wheels aesthetics. Ignore the climax's dull relaying of a theme and enjoy this for what it is, a mildly fun little airheaded motorcycle ride through the desert with some inventive eye candy.",5,3,10,16 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," O-Fend : The Last Snore
","Sorry fanboys, the 'final' (yea sure) installment appears to be even less engaging then the previous two with it's rushed script that felt like it was written as X2 was just being finalized. While the switch in directors did not really affect anything, airhead Brett Ratner does seem to enjoy glossing things up more then most. What seems to be lacking here is just any sort of memorable plot to latch onto throughout the 100 minute rehash. Yes, there is a climax that will have many fans emotional, the final moments in the end do attempt to build up to the epic finale we we're anticipating, but it feels like merely a distraction to make up for the majority of the film being endless retreads into characterization and moralization. By recycling, ad nauseam, the articulation of it's mutant themes, the franchise somewhere lost it's focus from an action film and instead lazily caters to the fans they know will always offer support by serving up the never-ending secret geeky handshakes of nerd recognition via mindless, pointless character cameos and undercooked, overvalued comic-specific references.",4,1,1,1 October 2006
The Lives of Others," Well made, though certainly short of spectacular
","Donnersmarck's much talked about film is certainly an impressive debut, pitting a suspenseful tale of political intrigue against East Germany's ultra-shady governmental proceedings during the mid-late 80's, but as per usual with most films containing any sort of bona-fide talent these days, remains over-hyped and over-rated. ...And a little overlong as well. Eventually many of the fairly dumbed-down script's (though certainly not by American mainstream standards) plot-twists become unimpressive, leaving me almost apathetic nearing the final stretch of character ambiguities. The film does end on a high note, rounding out some of the former repetitious tension (an oxymoron, no doubt) and lengthy chronology on a fairly just note. Just another one of the thousands of examples of excessive and lavish praise being heaped on a certain project, thereby dwarfing the effect from high expectations. The Lives of Others may gently explore many potent themes remaining crucial in our society today, though the film itself felt underwhelming to it's rewards ratio.",7,1,5,17 August 2007
Across the Universe," One of the more hit or miss films in recent memory
","The incomparable Julie Taymor strikes again with her vastly ambitious musical set to alternate versions of Beatles songs. Certainly with it's share of misfires, some a little embarrassing, Across the Universe is still a wildly creative and sometimes stirring roller-coaster ride down the interpretative lens of some of the world's most successful pop song lyrics.What Taymor sets out to accomplish in her film is nothing short of miraculous. By organizing her so-so plot about two lovers and a myriad of supporting characters around many of the groups most popular songs, and in fact synchronizing scene after scene so the lyrics often literally translate out on screen at that moment within the context of her story, she is obviously going to have some sequencing not fit in the most intuitive way, as the film's slow beginning hints.When this restless director is firing on all cylinders however, Across the Universe becomes a marvel of beauty, an exquisite mixture of sight and sound no less powerful then when Pink Floyd's The Wall film debuted. Never mind the slight controversy of remaking these classic songs by different artists-although a few seem misinterpreted or just flat out butchered, I feel any true Beatle fan will feel like justice has been done to paint their visionary music along the skyline of consciousness.",6,1,3,11 February 2008
I Am Legend," Thoughtfully implemented popcorn cruncher
","Surprisingly adept action film benefits heavily from Francis Lawrence's keen, at times stunningly fluid direction, powerfully high-concept production, and Will Smith's appealing, improving charisma. The former Fresh Prince and dance-happy, child-friendly rapper continues to buck the norm to further establish and nearly redefine his distinguishable leading man qualities in a performance noteworthy not for it's inherent skill but for the skill inherent inside the actor involving his largest anticipated audience.Of course it is flawed; whether one wishes to soak in this atmospheric counterpart to 28 Days Later on a completely visceral or metaphorical level, problems within the script halt Zoo York from being fully realized all too often. Without concentrating too hard on some dopey liberties taken and a questionable climax at best, I Am Legend still offers some of the most convincing post-apocalyptic, big budget renderings to date.",7,1,3,29 December 2007
The Illusionist," Sleight of Film
","The unique mileage Edward Norton and company get out of this period piece mystery does have it's merits. Sequences in which the enigmatic magician conjures his intriguing imagery inside many of the murky, though classy stage setups remain the overriding soul of this movie despite any romantic developments or late act revelations. The heavily accentuated ambiance prevalent in those scenes does wonders to elevate the interesting but somehow gimmicky character study that at least the first half of this movie purports to be, replacing Norton's questionable interpretation of the work with some authentic scenes that bristle with the kind of on-screen magic this illusionist was trying to represent to his audience. In this aspect writer and director Neil Burger has succeeded in giving viewers some of the most original entertainment of the year. Unfortunately, the majority of the remaining plot to divulge does not necessarily complement the highlights, and often pales in comparison to the original set of aesthetic values placed on the actual stage performance of The Illusionist. While Burger does weave a passionate love story around the magic, one can't help but think all the romance, action, and conflict surrounding this script feels sort of tacked on to the one trick pony that it really is. Acting is uniformly decent, with even the likes of Jessica Biel wearing her role somewhat convincingly, although it did seem like Norton was a bit lost with how to interpret this different character, too many times relying on a vacant blandness that has all but consumed the latter half of his acting career. Undervalued Rufus Sewell added that much needed edge, while the always good Paul Giamatti surely impresses with his refined technique, but needs to revert more to doing what he does best, playing the types of roles that got him big in the first place, ala Sideways, and not trying to be so well rounded in his movie choices- an admirable goal for any actor, but in his case a discredit to what he does best. Overall this is a worthy film to see, although more for conceptual originality then for any actual originality to be found in the script.",6,1,3,8 January 2007
Transformers," The beauty of mashing metal
","Despite Michael Bay's numbingly loud and macho direction, he seemed a good fit for presenting this alternate vision based on the 80's toy superstars. Yes, all the trappings of a typical Bay film are present...The pretentious camera-work, embarrassing acting, laughable script, and visual overkill all remain in spades with this spiritual successor to Independence Day, yet somehow the movie remains watchable until the end. Mainly this is due to the unsung heroes of movies like these: the computer animators. Here they are allowed to reach new heights with some outstanding point-of-view renderings as these gigantic robots battle for supremacy. In what is this year's most explosive, debris-laden sequencing, these CGI artist's elevate the formulaic and exploitative idea and turn it into a profound tech demo. While the actual Transformers themselves feel more manipulated into a petty human-based script then what this adaptation should have called for, the presence of lead Shia LaBeouf considerably helps alleviate so much dead weight supplied by the rest of the flesh-based cast.",6,9,18,12 October 2007
Children of Men," Spledidly visceral but surprisingly shallow for it's content
","Provocative drama-action premise, taking place in the not-too-distant future of England, doesn't quite fulfill it's amazing cinematic potential but offers plenty of worthwhile attempts at being swept up into the compelling atmosphere. In adapting this dystopian tale for film, Alfonso Cuarón brings a tremendous urgency to the pace, shooting all action with an astounding clarity that elevates this drama to a believable nightmare of immersion. Sadly I feel the script, written by five people no less, is not able to keep up with the near-visionary production intellectually, emotionally, philosophically, or otherwise. It would seem that with a plot as horrifyingly profound as the one we are dealt here, more relevance would have been put into the dialog and motivations surrounding our protagonist, though here against the apocalyptic setting everything just sort of breezes by neatly along it's designated plot-arc, sometimes feeling entirely too mechanical for it's own good. While there is always a rousing spontaneity through the lens of Cuarón's perceptive direction and Emmanuel Lubezki's tremendous action cinematography, too often Children of Men's actual story feels preordained, as if we are just watching a serviceable Clive Owen running through steps 1-10 without having the slightest interest or indication why we should care. There are times, though they are few and far between, where you can tell the cast and crew misread a particular scene, offering unintentional humor instead of the tragedy the moment would imply. As second-billed, Julianne Moore fans should beware, her role is short and small, absolutely not the lead role performance it is being touted as.Eventually it becomes clear that Cuarón was more interested in this project for aesthetic reasons then underscoring thematic intent, which will still leave viewers quite an explosive piece of science fiction with a little bit of relevance thrown in. Try not nit picking that much on plot-points though, and you will instead be rewarded with last year's most impressively executed action sequences....anything else taken from the entertaining and thoughtful piece of Hollywood movie-making, one can write off as a bonus.",7,1,6,28 March 2007
Mission: Impossible II," Outstanding mediocrity
","Technical extravaganza, helmed by violence artist John Woo, for better or worse subverts any intention this movie has to be taken seriously in the slightest, and in turn provides some pretty spiffy action entertainment. Offering stark counterpoint to Brian De Palma's more grounded, practical minded, more serious original, Woo seizes the opportunity to bask in this cash cow franchise with some of his most ludicrous, surreal, and fascinating choreography and stuntwork to date, all under the blanket, of course, of the certifiably generic script. Complete with viruses, bitter ex-agents and femme fatals, MI2's weak plot won't matter much once the insanely over-the-top tone soaks in. While detailing some of the particulars leading up to the convoluted action might not be his strong point, Woo definitely manages to make some of the scenes exude far more sensuality then they have any right to be (the help of luscious Thandie Newton does not hurt), and while Cruise's 'bad in black' shtick might not have stuck, the impressive lensing makes even this look badass.",5,0,1,28 October 2006
World Trade Center," Substitute cynical nit-pickings for the harrowingly immersed experience
","Although there have been at least a dozen movies made about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Oliver Stone's massive take was the first one to cross that line between quiet, humble documenting to loud, unabashed movie-making when it came to presenting his perspective on the unforgettable day. Frustrated with what many saw as a total lack of that very perspective (coming from the conspiracy ridden, anti-government lens of Stone) many found World Trade Center to be nothing but a cinematic slushee, a predictable yarn to patriotism, some cinephiles even suggesting as an overt attempt to mend broken fences with many viewers after the epic financial failure that was Alexander. While this film for the most part does not display any of the traits we have come to know Mr. Stone for adhering to in the past, we are still given an uncompromising film in it's patriotic induced fervor placing, instead of paranoid theories, two fact-based accounts told straight from the officers and wives who went through some of the harshest ordeals during the attack.The real life events, as shown through NYC port officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, usher the viewer through an unparalleled view in and underneath all the vast chaos that had kept the world captivated to their television sets days on end. Played by Nic Cage and Michael Pena, these beat cops are given a loving tribute as the microcosm to the thousands of good city workers who fought through this disaster, and the few who unflinchingly ran into the heart of darkness, as if only driven by instinct to protect a fellow human despite the surmounting odds against their favor. Basically it is this emotional sentiment which, lingering in all the haunting imagery captured for this film, overrides any overt exploitation or apathetic conflict that more cynical viewers have complained about. There are moments in the film that I would imagine would be entirely too hard for many people directly associated with September 11th to watch; Stone wastes no time carving out the cinematic vision he saw taking place for these two officer's lives that day. While there are numerous examples of how he might have gone too far and dramatized the reality of that day in a way that would be insensitive or uncomfortable to the relatives of any victims involved, this overall cathartic triumph of human spirit ultimately wins out, in turn prompting some of Stone's most focused direction in many moons.I've never had the urge to rag on Nicolas Cage, it has been a pleasure seeing him evolve his craft over the years, but where that evolution ended seems to be apparent, replacing genuine character acting with the wide-eyed, over-eager line delivery he has indulged in so much lately. Here, although playing most of the time as low key and subdued as anything he has ever attempted, I still only saw this character as Mr. Cage with a uniform on top, unlike the lesser known Pena, who perhaps due to that very obscurity, gets away with playing a cop more authentically. For this genuine love letter to NYC and the American soul that the movie aspires to be, it was a tad disheartening to see this main role outsourced for star power, rather then playing it more realistically low-key in the spirit of all of these average-joe city workers, of which the eccentric star actor has a difficult time even pretending to be. Only distraught housewife Maggie Gyllenhaal, in all of her beautiful flights of insanity, justified the star recognition for her perceptive performance. Despite the many small factors that prevented the film from becoming the definitive classic that it may have been striving for, WTC details the twin tower's collapse more passionately then anything we will probably see for quite some time, making it the definitive 9/11 film experience for less ashamed moviegoers.",7,1,3,10 December 2006
Black Snake Moan," Well made and original guilty pleasure not to be taken literally
","A fantastic elevation of his southern-fried cinema form, Craig Brewer proves that there's a lot more to the durty south then rappers and pimps with his exciting and unique third feature Black Snake Moan. Replacing the crunked- up template that helped garner Hustle & Flow all of it's gritty praise, Brewer shifts the focus to a way older musical tradition in the South, the Blues. Proving the opposite of a one-trick-pony, this noticeable young writer and director weaves a potent spell of sleaze, laughter, terror, and redemption around Samuel L. Jackson's troubled, God-fearing bluesman and his fateful meeting with quite the tortured young lady.Setting up and concluding this original and entertaining scenario proves overwhelming when compared to a tense centerpiece, but is still executed with enough flair and personality to maintain a certain integrity the entire time. It is in these harrowing, yet comical sequences of chained delight (excelling, no doubt with a near-perfect score) where two entirely different souls learn to benefit from one another in this peculiarly endearing way, that will have audience members shouting at the screen in joy for some of the new year's most hilarious and wicked scripting- that is if they are not offended past the point of realizing how unrealistic it is all trying to be. Jackson, in a positively refreshing return to character acting roots, offers some of his strongest, most perceptive line readings this side of the late 90's, finally helping to burst my cynicism about all the similar, lazy characters he has been coasting through for nearly a decade. Fans of this icon will be in heaven to see Mr. Jackson finally give out another noteworthy and memorable performance, which sees the former Jedi and Hit-man slip into guitar-slingin, dirty blues mode without batting an eyelash. Similarly, Christina Ricci's go-for-broke intensity and vulnerability will leave few forgetful of the receding star's talent; the film serves to highlight both a return to form as actors.Brewer may not have known exactly how to finalize all of the unique elements his morality-as-exploitation film implements-some of the behavior of it's characters remain laughably sensationalist, and the underlying thematic resolution, as gained by these two main players coming to an understanding of each other, feels slightly forced (exemplified in a tacked-on end), but he is not trying to make a documentary-like piece of fiction here, he is striving for something equal parts sinister and joyous, and in that effect has largely succeeded with this wonderful piece of Dixie pulp.",7,22,45,27 February 2007
Into the Wild," Somewhat tedious to sit through, haunting in retrospect nonetheless
","I loved the heart of this movie, but it is delivered with such a dull-paced, self-important pandering that I cannot help but feel Penn's romanticized, vicarious camera clouds any real psychological backbone behind our lead's motivations. He is doing a good deed to bring this debatable inspiration to the screen, and at times his reverence for the material really shows. So it is with hesitation to mention that this too-revered interpretation does not contain as much truth as the visual splendor led me to believe. Emile Hirsch headlines the underwhelming cast, sprouting a cute little man-beard, not-very-believable philosophical manifestos, wide-eyed boyish looks, and little else. In brief moments, at certain angles, when he wears glasses and shaves in a few sequences he reminded me of River Phoenix, which in turn sadly reminded me of what a great young actor could be. I am happy for Hirsch's career, as I see a lot of praise for his (mostly just physical) demanding role here. He has been doing all the right things to branch away from the dreaded 'that guy in The Girl Next Door' syndrome, but he still has ways to go. Delivery-wise, Hirsch comes across like a younger DiCaprio in The Beach part 2. He just does not have the insight, nor the creativity to make this amazing character really jump off the screen.We can't really fault the lead too much though, working with an indulgent, preachy, but still lazy script (obviously an angled perspective from the book) and a direction that shows Penn more in love with the idea then the result. Yes, the scenery is often stunning (arguably reason enough to see this anti-cgi beauty in the theater), as nature tends to be. Yes, the film should resonate afterward with the inner romantic or idealist in all of us, perhaps for the finale with an epilogue revealing (to unprepared theater-goers) the fact-based material inspired for this release. But through some murky, melodramatic expository scenes, numbing supporting characters (with rare exception), all awkwardly contrasted to intriguingly put together 24-styled montages, Into the Wild feels more tame, selfish and safe then it's thematic content would suggest.",5,5,11,27 September 2007
Annie Hall," As heavy as it is light
","Merging those two ill-fated styles of comedic wit and sincere bite as seamlessly as any legendary comedy would, Allen's Annie Hall is every bit deserving of it's towering stature and as one of the high points in his brilliant career. Delivering scene after scene of convincing, multi-layered, and hilarious insight into our tragic hero's neurotic mind via a series of failed relationships, the analysis of the title role post, pre and during our negative one's crazed narration guides the viewer through an intensely enjoyable romantic comedy that is as unique and genuine as it is funny and tender. The blistering script will hardly ever loose relevance (except for those that just refuse to ever enjoy Allen's style) and the two lead performances are very real, accentuating the fast pace. In such a great career, it is still small wonder why this one will always be up there on lists with Woody, although the fierce originality he brought to the table that shines so brightly in this movie, eventually became his Achilles heel when that originality stopped being so original, and later altogether abandoned to an apathetic new generation. Hopefully his last rebirth of popularity via Scarlett will actually let him do what he does best on screen in this new one with her, albeit with much less force and gripping psychological relevance then the good old days used to provide.",9,0,0,27 July 2006
Green Street Hooligans," Urban sports drama from across the pond
","Chronicaling the lives of rival soccer (football!) fanatics in England, GSH offers a gritty, somewhat realistic view into some of sports most misguided fans. While bordering on overzealous, the plot is sustained by the collective spirited grunts exuded throughout this film testifying to the power of brotherhood in sports. The overall appreciation for the love of the game and a love of the groups that support them overshadow any over the top scenarios the die hard football fanatics get themselves into, providing an entertaining time for young male sports fans to sink their teeth into. Elijah Wood portrays his metamorphosis with quiet integrity, making this one of his more interesting lead performances. Right through to a gut wrenching climax, the film adds onto it's momentum, drawing even non sports fans into the partially commendable code of street ethics those willing to live for their particular British football teams selflessly display",6,0,1,9 June 2006

","This wonderfully made dramatic adventure manages to be both a powerful, solid Hollywood process and an inspirational, compassionate piece of proactive film-making at the same time, a feat one must not take for granted. Especially for the nearly two and a half hour running time, Blood Diamond remained exciting and engaging throughout, anchored by a sensitively developed moral curve, rendering the picture far more resonant than the action-induced frenzy much of it seems to be. Much of these battle intensive scenes, recreating the civil war hell taking place throughout this movie's well-pieced plot dealing with diamond smuggling in 1999 Sierra Leone, does become somewhat repetitious and overwhelmed in brutal violence, but to it's credit never becomes overtly sensational, instead continually presenting a horribly realistic backdrop of the downward hell much of a country torn apart by strife turns to. In the spirit of this compassionate work, Charles Leavitt's unpretentious script services the plight of these characters quite admirably, directed by seasoned vet Edward Zwick without the strain of artistic clout that usually prevents great work from becoming greater. The result is a movie experience as thrillingly entertaining as it is universally and profoundly engaging, no easy feat in our Hollywood markets; hats off to Zwick, Dicaprio and the rest who knew they were contributing to this important statement. The hot topic debate of Dicaprio's authenticity with his South African accent seems to me a bitter point to argue about. This is certainly one of the best roles he has been in for some time, surpassing even the tense performance he delivered in his other critical darling The Departed. What his accent may miss in getting every subtle intonation correct, he makes up with in a fiery, naturalistic turn that is helping restore my faith in his abilities as it once was when he was young. I felt that, more then butchering any sort of accent, if Dicaprio was guilty of anything it was inflicting too many generic mannerisms at the end of sentences and the like, a small complaint in an admirable and invigorating turn. For it's brilliant synthesis of entertainment, education and inspiration, it is easy to look past any faults Blood Diamond may harbor in it's earnest grip around your heart, making this the most sincere blockbuster of 2006.",8,0,0,24 January 2007
Grindhouse," Slightly disappointed, though expectations we're admittedly very high
","Well kids, the Grindhouse has finally arrived, in all of it's blood-soaked, cuss-filled, vulgar glory. Does this duo of grimy flicks deliver on it's promise at offering a different type of entertainment for the modern day mainstream? Absolutely. Do the combined films form an entirely new experience, the likes a younger generation have never felt before..Not really. Though none shall come as close to bringing one back to the glory days of cheap, exploitative drive-thru style fare as the indomitable pairing of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino continues to show, the ambitious throwback to trash cinema is not without it's share of setbacks, chiefly residing with the overall creative indulgences both director's take while attempting to emulate each of their esteemed homage's to underground forms.Starting off appropriately enough (including the first of much touted fake-though not for long- trailers, which work with rousing success), Rodriguez's convoluted but fun zombie disaster piece seems to take it's inspirations a little more literally then it's successor. Planet Terror manages to squeeze in so many Grindhouse features that eventually one gets the feeling that Tarantino will be trying an altogether different approach. Packed with more titillating gore and slimy action then anything he has done since From Dusk Til Dawn, Rodriguez perhaps borrows a little too closely from his cult hit of over ten years ago to portray the gruesome but never grim battle a dwindling number of residents must put up against an increasing number of poisoned undead. Showcasing some of the fantastic make-up effects that made Dusk such a guilty pleasure, Tom Savini's extended cameo surely factors into all the gore this half of the feature provides. An excellently dated score, composed by one-man-creative-team Rodriguez himself, lends perfectly to the older feel of the film and cannot be credited enough in finding a memorably familiar voice for the inhabitants of Planet Terror to dwell about. In the end, this first half of a double feature provides all the traditionalistic toppings one would come into Grindhouse expecting. Highlighted by some explosively sexy action sequencing (of course prominently advertised with Rose McGowan's leg-shooting antics), Planet Terror cuts out just as it is about to overstay it's welcome with a wild if predictable conclusion.Following with three more artificial movie trailers, guest director's Eli Roth, Edgar Wright and Rob Zombie wisely use the few minutes they are given to provide some explosive comedic relief while indulging their b-movie fetishes. Complete with phony advertisements for Mexican cuisine, this five minute wannabe intermission serves as an interesting divider and fun way to help the audience take a breather but ultimately does not escape the pompous construct that it is. It seems a loyal dedication to the audio and visual characteristics that made these 1970 style film's such pleasant memories for these warped film-makers ends up feeling like it's chief pretentiousness. While it remains cool throughout to see Rodriguez and Tarantino emulate the old days by adding dirt, dust, missing frames, poor edits, and an overall muddied production to the two tales, often these indulgences seem to be less about the style of the film and more about hiding a distinct lack of storytelling or personality these writer's should be articulating instead of shunning.This becomes no more apparent then after a few minutes into Tarantino's Death Proof, which from the very beginning employs too many cheaply edited pot-shots that do nothing but gently condescend the viewer with it's misleading mystique. I'm all for the style they are striving for and the cool conceptual gambles they took here, so long as they are not purposely, and repeatedly taunting their audience with the clunky editing, which by and large it feels like. Thankfully it seems Tarantino got most of these unnecessary quirks out quickly into his movie so he can concentrate on what he does best...or not. Largely the Yang to Planet Terror's Yin, Death Proof is a highly indulgent, dialog driven moody revenge piece. A far cry from the fun, fast pace of movie number 1, Tarantino's extended conversations centering around a group of (not so) bad-ass females may leave many of the director's fans expecting more. Though largely redeemed by a powerful climax and ridiculously entertaining final shot, the majority of this bloated short finds the once profoundly relevant screenwriter at his mediocre best, spending an inordinate amount of time concentrating on the weak exchanges between a group of women Tarantino obviously thought were cooler then the final product dictated. As we watch a pseudo-edgy female cast talk through an unnecessary amount of Pulp Fiction-like banter that refuses to engage the crowd, most non-visceral tension is largely squandered by the writer's inability to further Stuntman Mike's (a refreshed and rockin' Kurt Russell) characterization which leads to a spectacularly filmed, though psychologically unfulfilled car chase finale. Though the fragmented Death Proof feels underdeveloped and even lazy at times, Tarantino will never have a lack of tricks up his sleeve to completely sink the piece into boredom. Alas, when the ego-maniacal director is not busy indulging some irrelevant fetish of his, Death Proof is a taut, eerie film that makes good on it's deal to shoot some of the most harrowing car sequences of the past few decades.Anyone not directly investing multiple sleepless nights of fanboy devotion in anticipation to the B-movie double feature spectacle should not feel shortchanged despite all the problems I have noted above. An overabundance of hype in two of our generation's more conceptually ambitious auteurs has somehow wounded this overwhelmingly fearless piece of work, and though it may fall short of some expectations, Grindhouse chiefly delivers all the hell-raising, flesh-chopping, chick-watching, tire-screeching goodies it had promised. Viewers are treated to plenty of 'I can't believe they are showing that on screen' moments, but the cumulative effect unfortunately does not add up to the transcendent crowd-bonding experience I was led to believe should happen.",7,26,54,4 April 2007
Invincible," Football nobody hits hard but doesn't tackle
","Inspiring by-the-numbers, sports underdog movie that gets a surprisingly heartfelt, authentic treatment given the Disney pedigree and the general rehashed theme. This particular John Smith-soon-to-be- sports-star comes to us by way of Walberg's Vince Papale, the real life Philly Eagle who rose from obscurity to become one of those he was, only last season, seen idolizing. The general theme undoubtedly effects itself on the viewer, though the real life hopes of head coach Dick Vermille (the always reliable Greg Kinnear), in his unprecedented move to appoint Papale to the front lines due in part to the amount of heart his new star would infuse the tired old team, is doubtful at best. While the movie climaxes in a way that merely foreshadows the winning era these late 70's footballers were about to recapture, the validation Papale feels during his one victorious game seems sufficient enough to bring closure on this personal tale. Unfortunately, due to the intense but short starting period only being covered in this great career, the vision that Vermille saw in this player for building the foundation of his new winning team is hardly justified to the viewer, leaving with a conclusion that does feel warm and fuzzy, but not quite as powerful or realistic as film fans, especially sports fans would have wanted..This flies in the face of the otherwise realistic tone (albiet for Disney standards) that was taken to project the time and culture of this particular piece. Walberg continues to impress with the subtle refining of his craft, working throughout those long battle hardened years to peel away the macho posing which dominated his early life. His scaled back, nuanced approach lends itself nicely to the humble nature of his quiet character, beckoning audiences to cheer for his catches, and grunt for his tackles, in true Hollywood sports movie fashion.",6,1,2,28 August 2006
The Descent," Going down is more fun then getting there
","Visceral horror movie delves deep into atmospheric terror as six female adventurers set off on their annual group expedition, this years trip being centered around the lovely cave expedition one member has planned. With a finely implemented pace, The Descent moves along with a stylistic and palpable urgency usually not found in the horror genre, especially in what devolved into a more generic one. What, for at least half the film, felt like an anxious buildup of suspense carried impressively by the claustrophobic design, sadly reared off course into a less gripping scenario of stalker-based antics, followed by your surefire balls-out showdown providing fans with their much needed and satisfactorily delivered gore fix. The atmosphere intensive and psychologically compelling buildup far outweighed the more generic follow through to me, however that is not to say that these later action scenes, though edited beyond some recognition, are not executed with the same artistic integrity shown throughout the impressive shoot. For many of the inevitable generic trappings the nemesis can be compared with, credit must given to Neil Marshall for imagining this particularly arresting set design in order to let his mechanisms convincingly thrive. The all female cast make the journey a little more unique, bringing some interesting, albeit underdeveloped characters with intriguing though undercooked subplots to the table, but it is surely the setting itself that wins the attention of most.. an outstanding horror backdrop, to play out some less outstanding actual horror.",6,0,1,22 December 2006
Inside Man," Mediocre film doesn't redeem itself by it's revelation or by it's big name cast
","Moderately exciting cat and mouse bank robbery movie, of course with a 'twist', serves as a decent throwback to the early genre, although it provides little past it's superficial purpose. The A-list cast perhaps make the film appear classier then it ought to, although the work here is nothing beyond the range of ordinary from what we have seen these people do. I would even go so far as to say the great Jodie Foster's character was practically undefined and merely put in for cosmetic reasons, an undesirable angle that took away from the initial tension. Written and directed in this sort of detached manner, despite the tense plot, Spike Lee often shows up apathetic when certain scenes play themselves out although the pseudo-spontaneity sometimes produces genuine emotional connections and well timed delivery which serves as an unexpected subtle treat in this otherwise entertaining but far-fetched and mostly uninspired caper.",5,0,2,28 July 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Promising material interpreted with no passion
","Notoriously controversial adaptation of the best selling novel dealing with secret historical codes, evil priests, and pursuit of the holy grail fizzled out as soon as it premiered last year in the theaters for many reasons. While I applaud the producers for taking popcorn entertainment down an unusual route, Ron Howard and constant collaborator Akiva Goldsman just miss the mark in too many ways to effectively put across a film of this magnitude with their immature adaptation. Let us not criticize the movie more then it should be however; the insane amount of pre-release hype and controversy coupled with the subsequent and immediate, intense letdown upon arrival surely embittered and affected many of our more cynical viewers upon rating the movie. The Da Vinci code is a refreshing pop movie, with some historical heft thrown in for fan appeasement. This material could have been interpreted in so many different ways, from dumbed down adventure fare, to stodgy intellectualism mired by historic observation. The team behind the movie adaptation do succeed at combining these two traits into something that is more accessible to the most amount of potential viewers, leaving fans of Indiana Jones type exploration or history buffs alike open for a relationship, it is just that they explore both of these avenues in very shallow, yet awkwardly scripted ways. Fans of the book already have much working against their favor with Hanks being a major miscast and the general dumbing down that comes along with adapting for Hollywood. However, viewers who didn't get on that gigantic trend that was the book a few years ago, and leave their willingness to criticize and take seriously at home (in another words, normal folk who go to the movies to be entertained, not snobs like us), will find themselves at the least mildly entertained and hopefully even a little more intrigued at this glossed over, but still, age old mystery.",5,1,3,13 November 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Freshman year at Hogwart's passes the grade
","Although the first installment of the Harry Potter series falls slightly short of the all-encompassing magical experience it had hoped to be, one must admit it did come pretty close to a total triumph. Based on the insanely popular children novels from author J.K. Rowling, viewers are entertainingly introduced to the enchanted world of young witchcraft and wizardry which had captivated an inordinate number of readers. 30 minutes into the expensive film and it is completely clear why.Rowling has crafted an exquisitely, conceptually rich fantasy world which manages to combine many darker, reality-based themes and deal with them through the wondrous world of Hogwarts. It is in this immensely beguiling school a majority of the entire franchise will take place, and it is easy to see why. A new vernacular with which Rowling describes her alternate universe seemed to have resonated with many more people then expected, and in this satisfying introduction director Chris Columbus wastes hardly any time getting into the fun of it all. Not since the mid 80's have we seen such a lovingly detailed homage to children's fantasies, labored over in such a way that would make any hardened fan of the genre blush.Brought to life by a great cast, many experienced actors playing professors of the magic school only make these young trio of children, whom we will come to watch mature, that much more engaging. Daniel Radcliffe may have been a little over his head with this first installment, arguably overshadowed by his two co-conspirators. He nevertheless accomplishes the task of portraying the iconic shy boy wizard with a little directional and a whole lot of conceptual help, ushering in one of the more lucrative franchises of modern days.",7,0,1,31 May 2007
The Fountain," Pretentious psycho-spiritualbabble for us Western dummies
","Overbearingly ambitious metaphysical yarn was one of those projects passed around and restructured around different actors a few times and unfortunately, it shows. Darren Aronofsky's long awaited follow up to his break-thru smash Requiem for a Dream may have noble intentions but has second rate written all over. In his undercooked and convoluted script, Aronofsky will proceed to beat viewers over the head with themes on death and rebirth in so many ways. Three different scenarios, all centering around the underdeveloped love story, weave within one another in a way I'm sure will remain appealing to the young demographic it will reluctantly take on, but feels embarrassingly trite for the demographic thought to be in mind.Let's start with The Fountain's appropriation of a much stressed spiritual context. In what was supposed to feel like allegory for the soul's evolution instead is butchered into three convoluted narratives which do little to exemplify the material at hand. For the most part, scenes in The Fountain have the unfortunate air of a thrift-store film, one can absolutely sense a middle-ground compromise that tarnishes any authenticity the film had going for itself.All of Aronofsky's cinematic trickery (and even a few sublimely framed shots) cannot rescue The Fountain from drying up. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz aren't the worst overpaid actors around, though what they bring to this vision stays superficially deep. Unable to master dynamics needed to lend the epic pull this movie posits, Jackman and especially Weisz turn in disappointingly unimportant, selfish performances. It all adds up to little more then a time traveling soap opera with some shiny eye candy thrown in. Viewers may enjoy piecing fragments together in order to gaze upon a naive vision in all it's splendor, but most wiser enough to feel a stinging pandering to ones sense of soul will achieve little resonant redemption for following this through. It's heart may completely be in the right place, and for that we will still hold hope for Mr. Aronfsky in future endeavors, but unfortunately I must declare the film an undeniable failure in any greatness it seeks.",5,6,12,12 May 2007
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Slacker-sheik... A wonderful music movie may sadly be lost on non-fans
","A fitting tribute for the self-professed 'World's greatest rock band', Tenacious D's peculiar brand of epic song mockeries are hilariously adapted to feature film. In what could be a front-running candidate for the funniest musical film since Spinal Tap, The Pick of Destiny will only suffer criticism when paired with a non-fan who is not expecting a musical. Anyone who is familiar with the insane energy and zany humor of the band will feel right at home however, with the non-stop whirlwind songs relaying one of the D's earliest missions. In rolling out this prequel to their HBO cult classic show, stuffed with medieval imagery, marijuana homages, and foul language, Kyle Gass, Jack Black, and director Liam Lynch manage to get the insane tone of this wild band just right, producing one of the most consistently funny and clever musicals in memory. Though the film is easily accessible to anyone with even the slightest interest in rock music, the constant in-house jokes and wealth of Tenacious D material sang during the movie will most likely alienate closed-minded viewers who had no idea they were getting themselves into this massively warped songbook. Anyone craving a melodic edge in their dialog however may be rewarded past expectation with Black's never-ending surplus of energy, singing about the bizarre events as they unfold on screen, which would just remain insane ramblings if not paired with the acoustic alchemy of partner Gass. Throughout the short music film, the dark, edgy material weaves it's way through the pretend-epic's engagingly cute storyline, describing the meeting of these two rhythm masters, up to their fateful journey to acquire the legendary pick the title speaks of. The script may feel a little underdeveloped aside from all the concentrated jamming, but the irreverent duo's hilarious bickering will make you all but forget there even needs to be a plot. As long as one expects a musical, one as warped as Tenacious D fans have come to expect, there is no denying the inherent charm and unique flavor that this accomplished goof provides; it is simply the majority of movie watchers out there, who don't have any idea about what this band does, that may find all inherent joys throughout the fun-paced film sadly overlooked.",7,1,2,24 February 2007
The Departed," Extremely entertaining- nothing more
","One of the America's sharpest action films of the year? Yes. A masterpiece? No. A return to form for one of America's most celebrated directors? Yes. An evolution of style and substance? No. Martin Scorsese certainly gives the finger to critics citing his recent geriatric tendencies with his most visceral work in at least a decade, but in turn somehow manages to imitate, not emulate some of his finer styling's, at peak form during the 'Goodfellas' era. While stepping away from his traditional mobster and New York flavorings to tell this story about Boston police corruption, some of the more violent scenes, and even some of the environment panning clearly parallels, if not directly imitates classic moments from that prototypical masterpiece. What's worse is Scorsese's inability to change his musical palette when scoring these types of films, as half of the soundtrack also feels like a retread of the scenes he was trying to direct years before. Despite all of the noticeable unoriginality, The Departed still evolves into one of the most engaging guessing games in recent action memory, tightening the rungs around the paranoid plot line until we are all feeling the pressure. While some of the acting might not be academy-worthy, even the likes of Stiff Damon rose to the occasion to contribute to this classy thriller. Dicaprio provides a much needed boost to his sagging relevance as one of our finest young leads with his tense performance, while Nicholson once again shows that he has been done 'trying' for some time now, and just gives the camera whatever it is he feels like giving it, which sadly is still way more engaging then most actors, despite his characters becoming way to silly. Ignoring desperate, idealistic preconceptions and bitter Scorsese fanboys who vow to get a genius his directing Oscar, The Departed is a very enjoyable, engaging, and fluid action thriller that will leave anyone with the slightest bit of testosterone feeling very satisfied.",7,1,2,19 October 2006
Die Hard," In the rare pantheon of outstanding Hollywood action movies
","Nearly twenty years and millions of clichés later, the original Die Hard still holds up in all of it's Hollywood glory. One of the last films to come out of that greater era of quality popcorn entertainment (compared to today's standards), this fluidly visceral, though lighthearted study into the hostage tensions overtaking 40-story Nakatomi plaza has become a modern day action classic for all the right reasons.Sure some characters have devolved into caricature upon recent viewings (Hart Bochner's coked up Ellis), sure the entire mechanics informing this intense ordeal feel a little less gripping in retrospect, and sure an excess of one-liners can degrade the entire process on the whole...but not by a whole lot. Die Hard was perfectly calibrated to be as entertaining as it was bloody, adult, and exciting when it arrived. While time may have extracted a percentage of the urgency out of this eternally exciting experience, conceptually the original Die Hard will continue to remain one of the most captivating settings ever staged in a modern action film. The selfless direction from John McTiernan was hitting it's stride as he captured progressively intense battles in a simultaneously spacious and claustrophobic setting.It is the triumphant locale which hosts this intelligent robbery thriller that will continue to beckon re-visitation, though without the considerable tension between our two leads, Nakatomi skyscraper would remain an empty gesture. Bruce Willis could not have asked for a better early career move then to star as New York cop John McClane. Even if it did pigeon-hole his limited talent, Willis already displayed the raw intuition that made him one of our most agreeable action stars. His everyman style was one of instant cult likability: a person most average joe's could relate to, thrust into a situation no one could relate to. His line deliveries will pale to the actor who has slightly but surely refined his craft over many years, but the finesse with which he eases into the action with believability and likability became instantly recognizable.",8,5,6,29 May 2007
The Holiday," Professional and assured romedy made a few bad choices..
","Semi-excellent emulation of a modern romantic comedy at times but still takes huge leaps away from the intuitive joy that makes up the majority of this crowd pleaser. As one of Hollywood's few female mainstream forces, Nancy Meyers immediately reiterates why she is an intelligent enough writer and director to justify many clichés her feel-good material thrives off of. Nothing here is trying to reinvent the wheel, or reinvent the corny, sappy contrived nature of these films for that matter, but Meyers and her acting entourage get enough mileage out of the mediocre script by the sheer amount of warmth emitted from chief cast members. Heck, even the overcooked score still manages to evoke emotion where one would feel manipulation in less apt hands.Unfortunately, the cute and intimate performances that provide this popcorn muncher's adorable heart also serve to backfire on the film's small but significant redeeming qualities of emotional substance. For the most part the surprisingly engaging performances overwhelm a majority of fluff provided throughout the predictable outing, with an appreciated amount of detail paid to so many effective nuances, equal parts comedic and dramatic, during the interlocked romantic stories. The women sure do steal the show here though, I guess they all knew who would be watching it. Kate Winslet continues her emotional dominance, unparalleled even when in cinema's most trite of circumstances. Her attempts at more overt humor may pale in comparison to the heart-sweltering realism her dramatic chops bring to even the dullest of lines, but remains enjoyable enough. Surprisingly, Cameron Diaz gives one of her best performances to date, helping to justify her overrated stature with substantial proof of a masterful caricature, complete with an array of subtlety to boot. It is her powerful chemistry between an appropriate Jude Law that will keep the chicks coming back to this flick, sustaining the somewhat corny affair with an inspired Hollywood love affair.Which brings me to the backfiring part. Unfortunately the movie only works half as effectively as it wanted to due to the terrible casting, or acting of Jack Black. I really admire the guy but he obviously has quite a ways to go before conquering the romantic genre, even if it is comedy-based, in which his character resembles an infinitely dorkier version of himself (the only person Black has really mastered playing). Black shines when he is involved with a project near and dear to his offbeat heart, but here he feels awkwardly out of place, and in a very unintentional way. In effect nearly half of the movie's dramatic heft is severed by his inane take, even worse canceling out some of Winslet's moving work (thank goodness for Rufus Sewell adding some romantic dimension to her story), a character misread that seriously undermined the integrity of this light but tight direction.",6,1,2,5 March 2007
Love Actually," Fluffy and good-hearted
","A calculatedly cutesy affair from across the pond, Love Actually benefits greatly from this impressive ensemble cast featuring some of England's most popular brand names. A first length feature directorial debut from the extremely popular British writer Richard Curtis finds ease in delivering heartfelt and accessible warmth in spades throughout the two + hours of multiple character acts, though fails to tie all these inter-connected and pleasant enough relationship threads into a more emotionally cohesive whole.Feeling wildly uneven at times, Curtis lets a few of his characters breathe, while restricting others as mere wallpaper. All in all though Love Actually remains the lighthearted romantic holiday epic that it sets out to be by appeasing as many sappy-hearted Brits and Americans as possible and by cutting out the middleman known as subtlety.",6,0,1,3 February 2008
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Awards
","I am going with Paul Thomas Anderson's latest, more mature work as the best American film showing this year, certainly guided and downright anchored by Mr. Daniel Day-Lewis in another legendary performance of screen-shattering proportions. I will hear of many accusing this master character actor of overdoing it at times, serenading the camera with eyes viewers needn't peer too closely into lest our own humanity become compromised. The truth is, for every over-the-top scene which almost always remains justifiable in Day-Lewis's astonishing hands, observant viewers will be equally if not largely rewarded by the boiling subtleties which ripple throughout, just beneath this menacing surface of a man.As engaging a character study the movie feels (and this it firmly remains right up until an overworked finale), There Will Be Blood shines equally as bright as a brave new step for period westerns. Not in some time has fictionalized American history been so bold with creative and thematic assertion, yet accessible enough to render this harrowing study into greed without generation, and one for the books.",8,21,56,4 December 2007
Ice Age," Solid as a large chunk of ice in freezing terrain
","Equally balanced computer animated children's adventure carefully measures comedic, dramatic, and action elements to make the movie fly by for all ages. Ice Age shares most ingredients that make any successful animation work- diverse characters of opposite emotions, fast-paced and beautifully rendered visual design, heartfelt morality, and staggering zaniness (let us not forget the unsung hero of this franchise, the squirrel in his eternal quest to enjoy a little acorn). Put together in the competent manner that these animators have, and coupled with the unique setting and evolutionary insight the movie creatively offers, we have one of the more solid (non-Pixar)family computer-rendered films around.",7,0,0,16 November 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Powerful and entertaining in equal measures
","Another masterful attempt at injecting a fictitious character into real historical events and personalities, this successful film obviously thrives off of the passionate delivery from Forest Whitaker as the ruthless but smiling dictator Idi Amin, though eventually offers much more as well. It must be noted that the marketing of this movie does seem a bit disrespectful. We all know of the rave reviews and awards across the board Whitaker has been amassing for his fearless take on the eccentric and explosive ex-leader of Uganda, though all the hype surrounding his characterization has left the true main character, Amin's Scottish physician played by a likable James McAvoy, out to dry when being promoted, marketed, or even discussed after the fact.It is through McAvoy's eyes after all, that the entire journey to Africa and eventual partnership with Amin is transmitted to viewers, and though his well received performance is completely overshadowed by the colossal charisma coming from this title role, it is slightly disheartening to see no mention of a lead actor on any promotional material, cover art, or anything else desperately trying to let us know the film is a tour-de-force for Whitaker. At the same time it is also completely understandable, given the nature of business in Hollywood...and his show-stopping antics. The Academy award winning actor shines brighter then ever with his fire-charged interpretation of the plagued leader, rescuing many of the screenplay's minor unnecessary indulgences with this commanding role in his hands. Though I would argue Whitaker's performance opts for an overt delivery at the expense of most subtlety, even at his cartoonish worst the actor threatens a screen with such intensity, laughing endlessly while hinting at upcoming terror as to keep viewers transfixed throughout any dejected operatics. Framing Mr. Amin in a most stylish and flattering way, director Kevin Macdonald's constant use of provocative camera zooms upon the tyrant's uneasy inner space helps give the film the stylistic engagement and emotional urgency it needs, not to mention just complimenting Whitaker's great performance even more. The set locations were sumptuously shot as well, though this time it was not so much the increasingly generic African landscapes as it was the intriguing interior and exterior locations used for capturing the King around his decadent 'palace', helping to showcase Africa in a different light for a change. The film may become a little too Boogie Nights for it's own good, in it's attempt at rendering the party lifestyle indulged by the privileged few, but is of little consequence to the overall pace.What really keeps The Last King of Scotland fresh, barring the acting of course, are the interesting moral dilemmas played out by this conflicted doctor, as we watch a young naive idealist come over to Africa to make a difference while ending up doing something entirely different. It is a haunting, subtle, but completely powerful metaphor which lasts with the viewer well after the frightening screams from Amin have faded away. Though the climax felt a little mis-managed, the film remains entertaining and potent the whole way through, never betraying it's entertainment roots, yet offering much political and psychological food for thought in the process.",7,1,2,11 April 2007
American Gangster," Excellent, for OK
","Generic though meaty and detailed period crime piece makes good on it's Hollywood slam-dunk with two charismatic leads, outstanding set design, and director Ridley Scott's hip guidance to boot. It is nice to see all the effort that went into production, as emphasis here clearly falls on the atmosphere with a quite impersonal script guiding the procession. Yes, the film is a tad overlong, crammed with minutia, and awkward in spots, but in the end a lengthy procrastination leading up to the satisfying though under-utilized meeting between Crowe and Washington gets built up to almost epic proportions; like Heat, only a tad cooler, and way more derivative of crime drug cinema of the past.",6,1,4,17 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Well meaning entertainer caves in on it's devices
","Charming construct takes pride in blurring the lines between tragedy and comedy, reality and fiction, tenderness and edginess to entertaining heights, although the mildly cerebral script reads more like an accessible emulation then bona-fide creation. Tweaking omniscient observational prowess, proved masterful in such existential triumphs as Adaptation and The Truman Show, Stranger Than Fiction manages to pack most of it's brainy sentiment in easy-to-digest, bite sized formats that will compel audiences each step up the twisted narrative. The movie gets points for always maintaining a healthy intelligence that's not too heavy or pretentious for less intellectual-minded moviegoers, but in it's conceptual lightheartedness, most meaningful characterization falls prey to the broad and borrowed ideas.Acting comes and goes in waves of integrity, everyone did well to be in the moment, but some scenes simply work greater then others. By and large Will Ferrell's engagingly meek performance does not penetrate much of an inner reality, which may or may not have been intentional. Nonetheless, his noticeable but eclipsed performance of a sleepwalking taxman gets by with help from the great support, particularly in Emma Thompson's wickedly fun take on a creatively frustrated writer in search of some morbid inspiration.After much amusement is had at scribe Zach Helm's involving behest, his unbalanced third act does not manage to ground much of the overly conceptual gamble. This leaves a pointed character experiment with many wonderful, fictionally transcendent moments, some creative special effects, but also an undeniable shallowness beneath the inventive posturing.",6,1,2,26 February 2007
The Good Shepherd," Constatnly interesting though rarely engaging
","Robert De Niro's second directorial outing is a passionate but strenuous account of the earnest rise to the corrupted fall of the US Central Intelligence Agency as seen through one main operatives' decades of experience. The lengthy, detail-specific, at times tedious pace will surely be off-putting to more casual movie-goers and all who are not inherently enthralled by the infinite webs of deception surrounding those in highly secretive governmental positions, though anyone choosing to stick it out may be pleasantly rewarded. Much like his script for Munich, Eric Roth infuses a factual urgency that compliments the fictional characterization to provide viewers with the best of both worlds. Only unlike Munich, The Good Shepherd's ambitious two and a half decade plot-line will bog down many participants with covert operation details at the expense of character intimacy and development (written intentionally that way to portray Matt Damon's ultra-secretive presence, but still suffering a lack of character explanation as a result).It is only late in the third act that this chronologically impaired film fleshes out some of the more personal and potent themes the labyrinthine story of mistrust and moral ambiguity provides, culminating with a conclusion that will somehow justify much of the muddled exchanges bloating up the run time. With a slightly hypnotic tension, De Niro manages to take all of the paranoid, world-view sentiment that is supposed to frame the C.I.A's often malicious intentions for the audience, and by the end spins it into a cohesive whole centering around this main character's eroding consciousness supplemented by his encroaching apathy.Thankfully, Damon is able to fulfill his end of the bargain by providing some of his most subtle work yet. It is often hard for me to be engaged by this actor, but lately you can tell he has been working on his game, and it has never been more obvious when watching his huge role as hollow-everyman-with-secrets Edward Bell Wilson. He is able to suppress nearly all of his less believable 'charisma' in favor of the cold, calculated exchanges that give his character a more believable persona then what we are used to seeing from him, congratulations on rising to the occasion Mr. Damon. Ultimately the supporting cast gets the job done, but cannot help but feel superfluous when revolving around Damon's principal motivations.At times, De Niro's equation of secretive governmental policies to the same values that underscored much of his gangster genre work seems to rob individual scenes of some integrity, but for the most part the details are unveiled in a way that will appease both hardened C.I.A. buffs and more casual moviegoers alike. Certainly not for everyone though, those willing to sit through some unnecessary (though historically relevant), insider interpretations of past US events should be rewarded by the eventual formation of something entirely more substantial then the dry and cryptic details the movie frustratingly prides itself upon.",6,4,6,1 April 2007
The Queen," Not as engaging as I had hoped, but still textbook compelling
","Apropriately dry character study, which details Queen Elizabeth's recent popularity crisis in the wake of Princess Diana's untimely death, may not be the engaging drama of sublime proportions many Americans had hoped for, but still maintains a level of political and social intrigue that rivals anything personally substantial England has imported in recent memory. Using the disastrous Al-Fayed/Diana auto-crash and subsequent royal reaction as a springboard, the reliable Stephen Frears shows the glaring disconnect found amongst a detached and privileged elite against the outrage of a mourning public with compelling results.Although more subtle, witty, and lightly conceived then I was hoping for, The Queen nevertheless remains a captivating and illuminating piece of contemporary English history for the screen, all held together of course by Helen Mirren's masterful performance, and also a powerfully ambiguous and provocatively perceptive (though underwhelming in it's praise) screenplay. It is in these acute moments, which try to envision the tense reality behind closed doors of a notoriously unemotional family, that the unique charm and relevance of a movie such as The Queen begins to take hold. Whatever historical events the film likes to point out, such as the focus of The Queen's involvement with new prime minister Tony Bliar in combating this controversy, comes second to Mirren's quieter moments of old-fashioned introspection.At it's heart, The Queen remains a politically engaging and mildly amusing character study, echoing the hunger for a more inviting social climate through the doomed analysis of England's first family. The movie may play a few cards in favor of a royal idealism that betrayed the social climate of the time, but the gently fascinating combination of old-world values meeting new-world situations remains as captivating a political British movie as any to arrive on shelves in America for years.",7,0,0,12 March 2007
Blow," Grade A druggie escapist fare
","Tremendously entertaining docudrama focuses on the exaggerated life and times of George Jung, at one time America's entire go to man when it came to the importing of only the purest Colombian cocaine. While clearly presenting itself as sympathetic, viewers might not totally buy into George's plight or muster any sympathy for the character in it's biased agenda. However if there was any one character actor to inject some integrity into the cliché, it is the fabulous Depp, who effortlessly translates all of Jung's subtle grace despite the movie's overtly entertaining and shallow tone. This grounding ultimately saves Blow from becoming just another rags-to-riches drug movie, as it most definitely follows the formula quite closely as well as suffering from what I can only label as 'the goodfellas syndrome'. Despite it's predictable nature, Blow provides premium entertainment, with it's vast production values, large scope, and interesting narrative, all over a bed of fun, fast paced entertainment",6,1,2,25 September 2006
1408," Entertaining but unsatisfying....the clichés of exploiting subjectivity
","1408 is a decent enough psychological horror film that benefits from an exciting pace, attractive ambiance, and an unusually unhinged (though slightly over-the-top in a hammed out way) performance from Cusack. However, when battling it out in the final stretch, this mental exercise is exhausted with the constant plot-twists hardly adding up to anything more then...constant plot-twists. It is as if the third act of this hellish premise was so determined to continuously pull successive sheets off of our confused faces for further revelatory excitement that the conclusion just ends up feeling silly, contrived, and will likely end up leaving many viewers apathetic to the previous hour of entertaining suspense.",5,1,2,30 September 2007
Blade Runner," Always worth revisiting
","The landmark science-fiction thriller gets a much-touted Blue-ray release, and for anyone who ever valued what this film did so brilliantly in the first place, deciding on a purchase should not be an issue. When re-watching the slow-paced, visually immersive yarn with superior video clarity it becomes even more apparent that Blade Runner, simply from a production standpoint, remains a high-water mark in visionary design and all but overshadows any technically superior fantasy worlds created thereafter.Perhaps the lesson Blade Runner can still teach effects-heavy Hollywood is that CGI should rightfully be used to touch up things in post, since we realize how much more completely convincing and authentic things were when they actually had to be physically constructed and implemented. As technology has vastly improved over the past quarter-century, so the imaginations of our biggest and brightest cinematic storytellers shrunken. Never mind the many flaws within Blade Runner movie itself, they all fall by the wayside as we are continually reminded of a time that Hollywood put all of it's guts into sharing a vision with the world.",8,1,2,22 December 2007
Casino Royale," Sexes production up to disguise the same old stuff
","Daniel Craig, winning the much touted debut into one of film's most illustrious franchises, may prove a mild distraction from the encroaching apathy many action fans have found in the distinguished spy series over the years, but I must stress how mild that distraction really seems to be. Despite the repeated attempts at revaluing many tried and true characteristics found with our beloved 007, mainly all stereotypical Bond contrivances remain, an annoying contradiction that when analyzed, borders on artistic condescension. Not to over-think the predictable revamp past the point of missing it's point at mindless entertainment, Casino Royale still sends off too great a mixed signal with an overcompensated production masking the same tired old script.Sure, a few elements of relevance are sprinkled into the mechanical pace which finally help usher the static character of Mr. Bond into the 21st century (no doubt aided by go-to-guy Paul Haggis's likely minor, though significant script embellishments) but nearly every turn taken inside the detached plot, geared towards building tension against functionary, bland antagonists, feels disappointing and again, especially contradictory given the 'fresh paint' approach they were going for. This is especially true given the shady prequel-of-sorts' questionable action sequencing, by and large starting off strong and simmering down into occasional screen slaps of voltage which rescue from overwrought dramatics. As witnessed through the sensitively dull performance from lead Craig, Casino Royale is all about flash and intrigue, with very little honest style or substance to back up this supposed reinvigoration; Bond's new piercing blue eyes may parallel the production's slightly more visceral and sensual feel, but motivation behind this shallow rebirth still feels strangely lacking. Fans of the series needn't worry; certainly enough viewers have spoken in praise of Craig's turn, largely missing the point of the tired mechanizations that weren't supposed to accompany him downward into I-don't-careville, but one can see any step forward in this oldest action tradition as likely being for the best since we haven't a choice...For if history has taught us anything, it is that the Bond must go On.",5,1,3,8 March 2007
La Vie En Rose," Worthwhile doco-drama
","A worthwhile film to explore if one is interested in learning the storied history of legendary French singer Edith Piaf, La vie en Rose is a classy period piece production detailing the singer's rough upbringing through to her historic last stand.I credit director Olivier Dahan for piecing the movie together in a non-chronological way and adding dashes of surrealist imagery to help tell her story in a more intriguing, accessible way but the constant cutting back and forth does become excessive at points and almost seems like a distraction when it is too constant.Of course the award winning Marion Cotillard shines brightly as the tempestuous title character, though her makeup department shines nearly as bright, authentically reproducing Piaf's appearance throughout the decades with believability. I do not want to rain on her parade because it is a dedicated and demanding performance that she put all her heart and soul into, but one of the greatest performances of all time??..I think not. She is prone to overacting and hysteria a little too often for sheer perfection.",6,3,5,18 May 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Worthy production contradicts an underdeveloped screenplay
","The second installment of Queen Elizabeth's cinematic chronicles finds all the necessary ingredients returning to impart a classy experience, namely director Shekhar Kapur and Cate Blanchett in the title role. While much of the sumptuous production inherent in such a big studio period piece certainly delivers to the eyes, the plot's bumbling maneuvers cannot help but take viewers out of most of the queen's inner turmoil this film was supposed to be convincing us of, leaving little more then a stylized costume melodrama in it's place. Blanchett, never less then admirable in any role, feels underutilized in a script that coasts by with the conviction of a glamorous history lesson.None of it rears off-ramp too noticeably, but in general the movie will chiefly apply to British history buffs; even if massive liberties were probably taken, the specificity of these poorly developed subplots feel pre-made for those already fixated upon Elizabeth's recent resurgence in entertainment.",5,1,1,25 January 2008
Beowulf," A fun, if shallow experience
","As a normal film, Beowulf clumsily falls downward due to the paper-thin script. But as a 3D IMAX experience, the violent, eye-popping work transcends it's simplistic tale to offer viewers a visually immersed experience unlikely to be rivaled until we see some more 3D-intensive work to be released in the next few years. Never mind a few unintentionally funny moments and some questionable pacing during it's midsection. Sit back, relax, and enjoy all the sugar-coated eye candy (as especially witnessed in the splendidly rendered climax) as we witness the current evolution of film technology morphing into something more akin to a theme park ride.",6,1,2,2 December 2007
X2: X-Men United," A little better, but essentially the same
","Decent sequel pulls all the expected punches to topple it's predecessor, albeit in it's fanbase appeasement way. Continuing right where we left off, viewers are pretty much treated to a parallel go-around, although there have been a few noticeable tweaks. Action scenes, while still not nearly as stylish as potential would have, are filmed more fluidly and hold more intrigue then some of the undercooked action of the original. While the film still suffers from it's callous, measured approach, thankfully the cast's principal leads outshine the duller supporting ones. While Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey look and perhaps feel the part, their dry interpretation as usual takes away from some of the excitement, thankfully carried by the core actors. Fans will surely be pleased with a continued focus to bring the Xmen to screen, but casual movie-goers will likely feel indifferent as they enjoy their dosage of eye candy..",5,1,1,29 September 2006
The Ringer," OK Funny and surprisingly tender showcase for Knoxville
","A nice comedy that takes a potentially home wrecking scenario and classes it up the best it can. While surely prompting offenses from the few bitter scabs that project their political correctness unto everything they cannot equate, The Ringer somehow manages to make a laugh out loud comedy, whose principle character mimics and exploits mental retardation, into a heartfelt, feel good process. Knoxville, following a predictable script, proves he has the chops to be a decent leading man in his natural performance, replacing his physical pranks of testicle smashing with more seasoned acts of subtlety. Knoxville fans needn't worry though, this film does a great job at showcasing the man's more traditional approach of goofiness and his new more refined delivery. I always knew that he was far more talented then that group of likable morons from the Jackass crew, and for all the massive beatings he's had to take to get to where he is, I wish him a successful career.",5,0,1,15 May 2006
300," Noteworthy aesthetics beg to compensate for everything else
","Thrillingly visceral although noticeably repetitious, this fictionalization details some of the more rock-star moments which occurred during Greece's legendary Battle of Thermopylae. With acute precision, director Zack Snyder brings comic Frank Miller's dark adaptation of this epic war to the screen with a stunning vibrancy and attention to detail that rivals any artistic endeavorers to capture the heat of primitive battle prior. In these sequences of bloody beauty, all but the most estrogen-laden souls should marvel at the technical superiority and arresting direction caught up into capturing heated moments of blood-lust, distinguishing the creatively ambitious battle movie from similar, less splashy fare.Against longer living aspirations, the insistence on elevating all fighting to such artistic excess simply overwhelms the majority of the movie's plot-forwarding and character-developing instincts, almost making dialog seem superfluous when viewed in succession. Clearly we have a movie here that wishes to balance the dramatic significance these Spartans faced on those fateful days with an accessibility and wow factor just dying to appeal to the young male demographic. The fights remain vibrantly captivating throughout, though retrospect seems to undermine any emotional substance lingering due to the inordinate amount of adolescent pandering found during these artistically excessive sword fights. Likewise, much of the screenplay absolutely pales in comparison to any on-screen fighting, often clumsily filling in silences with repetitious, empty narrative reiterations on notions of pride, warrior spirit, respect, and any other empty sentiment tacked on to give the eye candy a little more supposed relevance.Still, anyone with a pulse should at least remain mildly engaged throughout the hyper-kinetic, ultra-stylish battle scenes, at least during the first few attacks while the presentation remains fresh. The film tends to devolve further and further into some monster-based fantasy as we go along, but anyone coming into 300 expecting a serious piece of factual storytelling should have already realized they are in the wrong theater. Everyone else, have fun!",6,5,14,7 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Fun but dumb
","Four better and worse, Fantastic Four is your completely predictable and stereotypical comic book come to life. Take one part mediocre acting, two parts serviceable special effects, and three parts conceptual action and you have the successful formula for franchise gold. The good news is the film stays so close to this formula that it rarely has time to indulge, lull, or pontificate upon any lofty Marvel notion, some of which their cousin movies often get swept away in. The experience is one of the less geeky endeavors for the booming genre, substituting the often found Achilles heel of excessive fanboy devotion for a more generalized, all- around fun time. Without wasting too much attention on character background, viewers settle into the more entertaining aspects of each superhero's special ability before things get too redundant.The bad news is that these five various fleeting super-powers we get to enjoy pretty much guide the entire plot through to it's predictably boring conclusion. Nothing really distracts this wooden script from merely going through the motions, and at times it can get overbearingly numbing. Coupled with the pretty-faced performances, and we get a comic-foursome as sincere Stan Lee's acting. Sure, Michael Chiklis plays against his airhead crew's type and offers some of the only emotionally graspable sentiment around, but even his lines come off painfully clichéd and just another element to move along the mechanics. Despite being just another pretty face herself, Jessica Alba is The pretty face, and any warm-blooded male under the age of 40 should thank their lucky stars she was cast.Choosing Tim Story (Barbershop, Taxi) to direct might have seemed odd to your typical white nerdy teen- the precise demographic for this fodder, but producers were thinking bigger then those narrow confines. Story does nothing to help elevate this one, but a more accessible urban vibe, however subtle, pervades the film and should be credited for helping expand the audience a little wider then expected. Helping refine the more mainstream elements inside this superhero spectacle, Fantastic Four may be an easily digestible dose of the Marvel universe, but becomes just as dumbed down for it.",5,1,2,25 May 2007
Click," Fun, derivative idea engages with universal theme
","This easy concept of a movie will keep casual movie fans engaged with it's silly exploitation of Sandler's newfound abilities to manipulate the space time continuum. The initial concept gets a full workout and technical buffs can gawk at the simple yet effective editing that goes along with showing how this character sees his world, through his control. Obviously the moral ramifications of such unnatural bastardization's comes at a price, which slowly paints the arc of this story with more serious, dramatic colors. To say that this movie is a unique idea however would be a joke, as derivations linking up to just about every other time traveling morality tale are abound but in the end, whether you enjoyed the goofy site gags or the melodramatic buildup more, the overall message this movie wishes to convey (which could be argued far outweighs the actual material) should stick. This philosophy that the main character came to speak of was a perfect way at translating through more zen-like nods to the 'moment' then most mainstream American films have the patience of realizing. Kudos to Click for making the case for this frame of mind without having for one minute to act it out pretentiously on screen, this is how you do NOT just preach to the choir.",6,8,18,3 July 2006
Happy Feet," Fun Loving Families: Watch this now!
","Extremely adept animated musical-comedy continuing to ride the adorable penguin wave of popularity proved masterful when compared against it's obnoxious, tiresome, and relentless add campaign that had turned so many adults away merely from previews. Not surprisingly, the movie will still have it's share of nay-sayers ridiculing an excessive cutistry (yes I made that word up, as I sometimes deem appropriate!) whirling around the singing chorus of birds for lengthy periods of time in a barren Antarctica... but in that ignorant cynicism, will have missed so much more that the movie has to offer. A dazzling array of content breezes through in the 109 minute run time that, whenever feeling overlong in it's song and dance sequences, balances out splendidly with delightful humor (complete with superb back-chatter), sincere romance, spectacular action sequences, and quite the little adventure of a plot thrown in with all of it's understated social, moral and religious ramifications shining through in a very natural, unpretentious way.Obviously for a movie that sold itself on musical numbers, Happy Feet had to deliver, and throughout the celebratory routines the music stays at it's utmost crowd-pleasing best. The producers knew what kind of event they wanted to induce for parents and their children when selecting the infectious songs that often combine to form supremely entertaining medley's that wisely pay ode to pop radio in a way that will engage viewers. It is the constant emphasis on Fun that prevents these sequences from becoming stale, often animated in a completely complimentary manner to the upbeat rhythms. For all this talk of the main uniform locale keeping aesthetics to a minimal variance, the animation team does an outstanding job at diversifying and beautifying the icy tundra in ways that keep each scene sacred and varied in it's humble homage to Earth's pristine state. Conecentrating on one specific set of components has obviously let the animators refine the penguins themselves to a charming physicality, no greater exemplified then in our lead Mumble 'Happy Feet' himself and his infectious tapping.Finally credit must me given to the man responsible for elevating a near-ridiculous concept into the year's best family animated feature. George Miller has truly come full circle in his quest as a director, having branched out through the Road Warrior trilogy starting in the late 70's only to find himself receiving an Oscar for best animated film of 2006 for an opus on singing and dancing penguins. That, is the mark of a diversified filmmaker.",8,2,2,25 March 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Excellent realist piece of Hollywood
","A touching, if slightly manipulative docudrama based around the financial struggling of one Chris Gardner, this inspirational yarn has just enough integrity to override much self-importance found throughout a somewhat preachy script. While relying on another rags-to-riches scenario to hold interest, what The Pursuit of Happiness does well is balance a grimy realism with Hollywood aspirations of sentimentality so as to wrangle both types of cinema lovers in creating one of the more impressive family films to emerge in a while. Credit producer and star Will Smith for knowing exactly how to play this one. From the sensible employment of Italian filmmaker Gabriele Muccino (who often elevates scene after scene with a greater eye for direction then this American genre is used to seeing), to an instantly appealing soundtrack, right down to his own contribution of his most assured performance to date, Smith is in fine form here. Once again reestablishing his dramatic credit as an actor, the one time rapper and punch line proves he can still carry a film of dramatic weight, and make beneficial choices behind the scenes. The casting of his real son to play his son here, who spends almost as much time on screen as the lead, should have come across as a self indulgent move the likes Hollywood royalty get to wallow in plenty. But just as the script's seemingly cornball leaning somehow plays out with more inherent truth then it should, Smith is able to utilize the precious bond he has with his son to astonishing effect in a way that hardly feels exploitive. Mild cases of overacting do arise, though a certain sincerity based on this real life hardship manages to shine through nearly every clichéd moment.",7,0,0,20 March 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Has all the elements but lacks some bite
","It seemed strange- In my memories I recalled Last Crusade being the most solid of the three Indiana adventures, capturing the Raiders sense of epic , historical adventure and Temple's humor and flair. Imagine my surprise that in retrospect, the third installment plays out less convincingly then the others.It's hard to say why time has been less kind to Indiana's last undertaking as opposed to the two before it, though it generally seems to stem from an authentic lack of inspiration. Many scenes, whether they are of the exploratory or action-induced type, smell of mimicry, particularly the film's later sequences attempting to emulate Raider's desert action.Thankfully Connery's elegant presence works wonders for the film's dynamic, who helps pull so many of the predictable but always impressive action sequences out of an impending mediocrity.",6,3,9,19 May 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Upholds legacy of America's funniest animated family
","Undoubtedly the most hilariously consistent laugher of the year, The Simpsons Movie might not be an absolute slice of cinematic perfection fans have been waiting twenty years for, but, all things considered, comes pretty darn close. I suppose one of the only true downsides to this quick-running 90 minute big screen incarnation lies in the fact that so many scenarios have been written inside Springfield over the past two decades that the movie sometimes cannot help touching on these same themes and situations. With it's breakneck slapstick pace and fun doomsday scenario though, only the most hardened of Simpson fans will even begin to notice any overlaps as the fading relevance these writer's once dominated comes out in full force, at least one last time.",8,0,1,7 December 2007
All the President's Men," Classy and informed
","A satisfyingly objective dramatization of the Watergate scandals as seen through two main reporters who broke the news, this will appeal most to those who love their procedurals specific, fact-heavy, and long. Going into the events with no prior knowledge and little desire to be more then entertained may leave an apathetic taste inside viewer's mouths, but those interested in exploring the multiple pathways of corruption in relation to one another via the cinematic form can do far, far worse in the detective genre then to study All the President's Men as a textbook example.Pakula's conservative, classy direction, noble capital hill production, and Hoffman and Redford together don't hurt, either.",7,2,2,16 March 2008
Atonement," Noteworthy production definitely underachieves
","Certainly overrated as one of the highest reviewed films of the year, Atonement nonetheless provides viewers with the epic scope and cinematic grandeur that some of the best British period pieces have provided in the past. Cinematography, set design and direction seems to elevate this somewhat generic tale of ill-fated lovers into a stratosphere of high art-it is not.Firstly, the film is being advertised inappropriately as an intense love story shared between two well known leads. Rather, Keira Knightley and James McAvoy's overworked chemistry take a back stage to a third party who, in fact revolves around the entire main story instead. Most romance between these two characters merely comes as an afterthought inside this troubled character's mind, leaving the movie with perhaps a bit more metaphysical appeal but taking away substantially from the emotional impact. The plot itself at times feels shamelessly light, often coming across like a classy soap opera instead of the powerful piece of fiction much hype has suggested.Atonement is certainly worth the watch, if nothing more then for the scenery and a few exquisite shots (the beach war tracking shot in particular was stunning and one of the most impressive takes with massive amounts of extras seen recently)....Just try to enjoy the lightness of it all instead of ending up scratching your head wondering where all the bona-fide passion actually is.",6,7,15,4 January 2008
V for Vendetta," Embrace the essence
","Moving philosophical action movie does not disappoint, although is clearly in need of a trim. While the primary theme of rebellion can at it's best be cathartic, and the relationship between it's two principle characters fascinating and inspiring, as usual the Wachowski's overpower their themes with unnecessary exposition, subplots that deter rather then add, and dialog delivered that still feels like it comes from the page in it's profound, but showman-like and detached nature. What saves Vendetta from all these pratfalls however is the heavy handed yet accessibly executed instigation behind the essence of what one yearns for when they yearn to be free. In that, Alan Moore, Wachowski's, and Hugo Weaving have etched into his character V the most compelling, larger then life character since Tyler Durden. To all those who would rather embrace an ideal rather then mull over minor distractions, enjoy this film's core. And by enjoy I mean be affected by it in a way that produces any tiny amount of physical change in our world.",7,1,3,31 July 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Off target but still more creative then many laughers
","The over-hyped, over-marketed racing comedy featuring overdone, overvalued Will Ferrell immediately had a wrench thrown in it's spokes, if nothing but for the sheer pomposity of it's advertising, through the sheer arrogance of it's lead's bank-ability. Though far from a uninspired comedy, Talladega Nights does prove that Ricky Bobby is no Ron Burgundy. In their last collaboration, writer/director Adam Mckay and writer/star Ferrell displayed much more comfort, knowledge, and wit when versed in their 1970's news world farce Anchorman which, while just as self indulgent and lapsed in solidity as any ex-SNLer's post resume would predict, still knew itself and it's humor quite well. With cocky, oblivious hot-shot NASCAR pro Ricky Bobby, we see a much more stereotypical, lazy script that easily plays the moron cards and relies too heavily on Will Ferrell's lukewarm improvisational flights. In their pseudo-lovingly mapped tribute to all things white trash Americana, this ballad comes out a little imperceptive, insensitive, even condescending. What on paper seemed like a great comedic premise to mine turned out to play like a bunch of city boys poking fun at southern culture. Though the humor is decidedly derogatory, there does lie a heart inside this crude cartoon cut out, even if that is also an insincere one. What saved the movie from being poor, despite my low hard laugh to forced chuckle ratio, was the same mature scope that was to enhance Mr. Burgundy's shallow escapades so memorably. Highlighting the seldomly sharp dialog, breathes the unique racing setting, with a narrative arc that basically parallels the other R.B., creating another unique sub-genre comedy, only this time suffering greatly from a lack of character perspective, coupled with a willingness to succumb to the character-worshiping, mass-marketed whoredom that it mocks. Disappointingly, ha-ha mastermind Sacha Baron Cohen's underplayed performance pales to anything he saves for himself and does not help add much comedic dimension in an already questionable supporting cast. Although Ferrell and crew may be wearing out their comedic welcome, they will certainly conceptually fight it until the end.",5,0,2,8 December 2006
