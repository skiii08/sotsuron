The Blair Witch Project," What a boring letdown!
",I've recently seen this movie and I really have to say: What a waste of good time and money. It was such a letdown. I've been reading about how scary this movie is and the only thing that I could think of was: Can't the witch be faster? I really liked the 3 young people in it and like in The Relic I couldn't wait for them to die!,1,1,3,15 November 1999
