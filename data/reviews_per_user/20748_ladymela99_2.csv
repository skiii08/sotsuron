Walk the Line," A story about real people leading extraordinary lives
","'Walk the Line' is a tender story about two real people who lead extraordinary lives. Joaquin and Reese both give heart wrenching performances as they portray the legendary Johnny and June Carter Cash but it is story that makes it the most memorable.Reese's Oscar nomination is one that is well deserved the amazing thing about her performance is that she shined without glamour and without upstaging Joaquin. She brought great strength to the woman of courage who was always in the shadow of both her family and of Johnny's career. The rock of which he stood. It was quite refreshing.The chemistry between Witherspoon and Phoenix is wonderful and I whole heartedly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see it, a Johnny Cash fan or not. And if you aren't a Johnny Cash fan, I recommend picking up a CD you won't regret it.The one problem I did have with the movie was the lack of the mariachi band on Walk the Line. Why on earth?",9,0,0,28 February 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Great movie all around
","I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this movie! It is one of the best movies of the year! It was shot in a manner that was realistic. It was quite beautiful without being to artsy. It was raw, but not gritty.The movie was mixed with news reels and advertisements from the footage of the era that blended in perfectly.The ensemble cast was real, one felt like these people were actually living in the era of McCarthyism and working for CBS, and while David Straithairn stood out he did it without upstaging the other actors. A testament not only to him but also to Mr. Clooney for great direction.The jazz music was also a great touch! :)",10,3,5,10 February 2006
