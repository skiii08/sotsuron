Ali," A tall order
","'Ali' left me feeling flat.   It seemed as if I had seen the story of a man whom everyone had forgotten, instead of a man that most still remember. Ali, in the film, seemed constantly confused and unsure of himself.  I believe Michael Mann wanted to play up this side of Ali since it was the side hidden from public view, but the result was that Ali seemed like less of a legend, and more of a lost soul.  Mann spends a good deal of the film (far too much in my opinion), with musical montages showing the bewildered face of Will Smith, to help illustrate Ali's inner angst.  These scenes don't help move the story, and made it difficult to tell whether the Ali was thinking, or just dim-witted. The part of Ali was played admirably by Smith, but it was difficult for me to get beyond the fact that I was observing an actor playing the part, instead of the great champion himself.  This was either due to Smith's inability to capture Ali completely, Mann's distracting direction, or the fact that Muhammad Ali himself is far too big a personality to accurately portray on film.  Likely, a combination of all three things. I had the opportunity to meet Muhammad Ali briefly a year ago.  Despite being hobbled by Parkinson's Disease, there was still something incredibly powerful and majestic about the man.  It was a twinkle in his eye, or an aura that was difficult to describe.  I don't feel that this was captured in `Ali'.  I am too young to have seen Ali in his prime, but I have watched all his great fights (and some of his lesser ones) on video or television. There is a good documentary, `When We Were Kings', that is about the fight where Ali regains the title against Foreman in Zaire.  I would recommend that to any who are interested in the real Muhammad Ali.",7,0,0,28 December 2001
Dead Poets Society," Entertaining, if you like heavy melodrama with little substance.
","After all the hoopla, what really happens in this movie?  One kid kills himself, a teacher loses his job, and the system remains the same.  Why does the kid shoot himself?  Because he has a stock character of a dad that doesn't understand his son's desire to wear tights and spout poetry.  What is a lad to do?  Try and really stand up to dad?  No.  Try and talk to mom or another sympathetic ear that might be able to sway dad?  No. Run away from home until dad realizes he made a mistake?  No... wait, I got it: Blow your own skull off!   And what about the lad's mentor?  The teacher who dared to defy the system and take the fall?  All the desk stomping and Shakespearean one-liners didn't save his job or reputation in the end.  He leaves and the system wins again.  So did anything really change in this movie?  Doesn't really seem that way.   A couple kids were more 'enlightened' I guess.  But how?  Ethan Hawke, whom I presume is the protagonist, watches his one pal kill himself in an act of cowardly selfishness, and his star teacher get crushed by the bureaucracy. 
This film was moving when I was in high school, but later viewings made me feel as if I'd been had. The film seemed to work for many people though. 'Oh Captain, My Captain' was the equivalent of the filmmakers saying, 'Cry, audience people!  Cry!'. It certainly is affective among the those 'poor', 'misunderstood' souls, as I felt when I was 14.  Fortunately now, I know better.",5,3,6,20 August 2001
The Good Shepherd," Finally a film that doesn't assume you're an idiot
","After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",9,420,518,28 December 2006
The Thin Red Line," Masterpiece, or mockery?
","When I heard Terrence Malick had come out of a twenty-year sabbatical and made a new film, I was interested.  After all, 'Days of Heaven', was a decent movie that was well acted and filled with wonderful cinematography. I had also heard from someone that 'The Thin Red Line' was poetry on screen-- an exquisite philosophical blend of the beauty of nature and the insanity of war. What I discovered for myself, after squirming in my seat for three hours on opening night, was cinematic masturbation with little respect to the subject matter of the story, and even less respect for coherent narrative.  Somewhere buried within the layers of gratuitous shots of birds and swaying trees, non-stop pretentious voice-overs and ridiculous celebrity cameos, was a story worthy of telling.  But sadly, this story never actually materializes and we are left with a dreadfully long, meandering LSD trip flashback, lacking any sort of truth or characterization.  To its credit, 'The Thin Red Line' has some beautiful nature photography, worthy of The Discovery Channel no doubt, and an excellent score by Hans Zimmer.  But these things alone do not a good film make.  After a two-decade vacation from filmmaking, Mr. Malick should have taken a refresher course in Story 101 before filling the screen with an unholy volume of philosophical mumbo-jumbo, and insulting the men who fought and died in the Pacific Conflict during World War II. I know there are many who swear this is a great film.  I would say that they have been duped by Mr. Malick in the same way that he duped the studio into unloading so much money into this wandering hippie experimental piece disguised as a feature film.",1,1,5,8 June 2001
