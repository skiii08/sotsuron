The Blair Witch Project," To call this a horror film is a grave mis-justice
","I hope the filmmakers of the Blair Witch Project read this. I want them to know what they did to me when I went to see this film, as it has left permanent scars in me. I may never be able to walk into a movie theatre again. I was forced to leave 1 hour into the film with hyperventilation and motion sickness. I was blown away, but I was too scared to know it! Quite simply put I haven't seen anything so amazingly original and incredible on a motion picture screen in a long time. To call this 'horror' is an insult to the creators, because this is scarier than any other film I've ever seen. There's no way to compare this to anything. Amazing. However they'll never sell another movie ticket to this reviewer. I'll buy it on video so I can have the lights on!!",8,0,2,5 August 1999
The Mummy," I'm insulted by this pathetic piece of poo
","I wish I was bribed to this movie, because it wasn't worth admission. Every film cliche doesn't describe The Mummy. To even try and explain it's sad existence is tiring. Let me begin with the previews: they show the best parts! Yes the effects are nice, for the few minutes they really spend showing them. The rest of the film is filled with Brendan Fraser and a chick and Arabs making one-liners and mumbling non-sense. I felt like I had seen Stargate, Godzilla, Independance Day, Diehard 3, and the Matrix, all pulled into one un-inspired motion picture that didn't even try to use originality. I wish the screenwriter had at least read some of the dialogue they used from a P.C. script writing software because it's boring. I think audiences would have enjoyed cutting out the romance scenes and all the rest of the filler and just showed an hour and a half of the mummy killing people, I mean that's  why they make these types of generic recycled films after all. I would like to ask the reviewers who enjoy this film why they enjoyed this film, because you've seen this film dozens of times. Be it a lizard, an alien, a stereotypical foreign assasin, or a mummy, it's the same thing, over and over and every summer. I'd like to spoil the ending but I was too interested in picking my toe lint by that time to care.",1,3,8,26 May 1999
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Harbor Truly a lesson in hack filmmaking
","This is one of the worst films made in a long time, a true lesson in hack filmmaking. It's a  film that capitalizes on the realization that tugging at veteran's heartstrings and showing lots of young and perfect looking men and women will produce a blockbuster- but this movie is a hit only in money made, because it is a joke. The characters are so un-likeable that one can't help but cheer for Japan, and only wish they had finished the job to wipe out these useless and dullish characters. The direction is slow and dull, and even the action scene of the attack comes off as over-baked and tiresome. The sweeping musical score, which is indistingushable from a hundred other action/war flicks of recent times, only is there to try and make the viewer 'feel' drama. Pearl Harbor fails on all accounts to an interesting film. Why not try a different approach? Why does perfect and hunky Ben Affleck have to be in love with a woman, why not make him a gay man? How about make Cuba Gooding Jr. into something other than his Jerry McGuire-sidekick role? Can Josh Hartness try to act and stop relying on his looks? Avoid if you can.",1,1,2,14 June 2003
