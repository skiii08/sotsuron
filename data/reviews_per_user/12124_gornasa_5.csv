Child 44," A really good thriller
","Man, I managed to avoid watching this movie for a year. I read some bad reviews and I kept thinking, I don't want to watch it, it's gonna be bad. Finally, because I had nothing else to watch, I decided to kill some time with this movie and I'm so glad I did. I haven't read the original book, and I try not to compare books and films because I will always get upset about what they did with the source material. Maybe if I'd read it, I'd be furious like some other reviewers out there. I really don't understand why people would call this movie boring and give it so little credit. Perhaps it's because they didn't understand that it was a movie about more than just the murders. I actually liked this concept a lot - the idea that there are several stories to it rather than just one story-line going smoothly from A to Z. Honestly, scene after scene I was wondering where the story would lead the characters, how it would end. The movie kept me hooked till the end. It was very intense, and quite scary too because the regime of the USSR was brilliantly portrayed and you can just sense that there must be something bad waiting to happen round every corner. If you imagine what life would've been like back in the day, you can feel what the director and screenwriter wanted to achieve. There were issues that should've been developed more. Some characters should've been given more attention and some things weren't explained so you have to figure stuff on your own - and maybe sometimes it's OK, but in this movie I think we should've been given a little more. For example, I didn't quite get why the whole operation was such a secret, why some people would kill some people and try to cover up the investigation. As much as I get that 'there's no murder in paradise' so you can't let anyone run around digging for some killer, I think that someone should've been interested in this guy. After all, 44 kids is kind of a big deal and why would you want to sweep that under the carpet? All in all, though, the story is coherent, the acting is great, the mood is dark and heavy just as it should be, and all the extra stuff that some people found unnecessary, in my opinion really adds to the movie and makes it multidimensional rather than a one-dimensional thriller-by-numbers. Such stories are about the people, not about the plot. Once you accept that this is this kind of movie, maybe it will be easier to watch it with an open mind. I loved it.",8,2,3,21 November 2016
Passengers," We'd all do the same thing
","So apparently a lot of people were SO offended by what's going on in this movie. Some said that 'it's not stalking if he's hot'. Looks like they missed out on some things in life, to say the least. This one is actually a no-brainer: no, it's not stalking if he's hot, well, let's say in 99% of cases. The thing is, this is how courting works. A guy who's interested in you tries to get your attention. At first you may not like him, and it doesn't matter if he's objectively attractive or not (here the critics of the movie claim that Chris Pratt is hot to everyone, which is definitely not true, so that kind of renders their argument void), but then you get to know him and you see that he's actually cool so you change your mind about him. Oh, and sometimes the guy may even be the total opposite of your type but he won't leave you alone, and you hate him for it, and then somehow as if magically he manages to make you fall in love with him. I'm sure everyone knows a story like that or two. But that's not what happens in this movie because here the characters are clearly into each other. So enough of the Stockholm Syndrome whining because 'Passengers' doesn't deserve all the hate. And yes, I'm a woman. But I grew up before people started going crazy about all this feminist/sexist/misogynist/chauvinist/perverse/stalker stuff that most of the time they only pretend to understand.There, I got it out of my system. Now on to the review. I give this movie a solid 7 for being a warm, pretty love story. I didn't expect it to be some great sci fi flick so I didn't feel cheated when it turned out to be a romantic drama. The story could've been a bit more fleshed out because there was potential there, and then, with all the special effects, it would've been amazing. I thought for a moment that this could be like 'Titanic' in space, but there wasn't enough substance. Still, the movie is interesting and definitely worth a watch. And even though we don't really see how hard life was on the ship for Jim when he was alone, we can infer enough from what we do see. And anyone who's seen 'The Martian' or 'Moon' can compare and imagine what it's like to be alone, having no one to talk to and nothing to do. What do you do once you've played a little basketball and done a little dancing? What is Jim supposed to be doing for the next 90 years? What reason could he possibly have to go on living? The movie does show very well how bad he feels when he has to wake Aurora up, and she does hate him, and that part of the story is pretty damn straightforward: he stole her life from her, sort of murdered her. But perhaps these two were meant to meet like that and make the most of what they got. If he didn't wake her up, their lives wouldn't be the same. And I don't think any of this needs explaining, really. When you watch the movie, you can understand all the human reasons for why they do what they do - why he doesn't want to live anymore, why he wakes her, why they fall in love, why she hates him but then forgives him. Seriously, this is so plain and simple. Like I said in the title of this review: we'd all do the same thing. Just imagine living alone in a place like this for a MONTH. I challenge you to survive that long without thinking of killing yourself at least once when you know it's all there is, that's all you've got, this big empty ship and 90 years of solitude and utter, mind-scrambling boredom. You'd be banging your head against walls all the time. So don't blame Jim for looking for a reason to live. I quite enjoyed this movie and I hope that the critics get a grip and get a life. This isn't a story about a stalker. If Jim is a stalker then Jack from the 'Titanic' is also a stalker, and so is Christian Grey (OK, that one is a bit of a weirdo), and so is Richard Gere's character in 'Pretty Woman'. Not every guy chasing after a chick is a pervert (or a chick chasing after a guy, just think of Scarlett O'Hara 'stalking' her dear Ashley). These are movies, meant for our enjoyment. Let's not get political about every freakin' story we see on the screen.",7,3,4,1 March 2017
Inception," A masterpiece that will get bigger with time
","So, after reading some of the negative reviews it's clear to me that some people didn't understand what happened in the movie. For example, one criticism was that Cobb's children don't age at all and that his father somehow knew that Cobb is in the US and went there to meet him, even though he lives in Paris. Well, let's get the easy bit out of the way: Cobb may have informed his father that he had plans to arrive. Or, maybe his father is on holiday, or he even doesn't teach anymore. But I'd say it's safe to say that we all know by now that Cobb didn't get out of the dream, that's why his kids look the same (which should be a clue to all the doubters about what REALLY happened at the end). It's pointless to explain to the naysayers what they got wrong. I could maybe agree that there isn't much character development but I personally totally overlooked it both times I watched the movie. I was fascinated instead by the whole concept and its execution. I can't add much more to what's already been said. This movie is an absolute masterpiece of storytelling. First, the whole idea of making a movie about something like this is unbelievable. Then you have the idea itself - how the characters went about planting the information into the guy's brain. Then there's the execution of this by Nolan and his crew, I mean, I watched it in awe when I realized what kind of work and creativity this required. Did someone just say, let's drop a truck from a bridge in slow motion, and that was it? This scene, this whole concept of this falling truck deserves an award in itself. Then, finally, you have the visuals, which feel super-real and express exactly what they're supposed to express. Add to it the fantastic score and you have a mind-blowing experience.What I loved on second viewing (and you have to see it more than once to fully appreciate its complexity) is that it all makes sense. Every single detail. It's like a symphony where no note is unnecessary and out of place. And you have to use your brain to follow all the breadcrumbs. I will repeat this: if you didn't like this movie, you didn't understand it. Nolan explains a big concept here, a concept that is actually simple but very complex. The logic of this whole story is so strong that even if you try to find holes in it, your brain will fill them up with stuff because it has absorbed this logic as you were watching the movie. That's what's so amazing about 'Inception': it talks about how the brain works and it gives your brain the chance to tap into the story to experience this dream too. Just as the characters' minds can develop the dream and build new stuff, your brain can do that too. I found this absolutely fascinating. But perhaps it's because I'm generally interested in matters of the mind. For those who aren't this may be just a big flashy science fiction movie. Science fiction? Really? If you think so, you totally missed the point.Regarding whether it was all a dream. Of course, people interpret it in various ways, some of those people even answered some of the questions about this movie wrong because they made the wrong assumptions.Even if it was all a dream, it doesn't ruin the movie, because the movie is about reality. Yes, paradoxically, it is about what makes our reality real. Those 'dreams' that the characters find themselves in, are versions of our reality. The movie's point is: if we can get lost in a version of reality, how do we know when we're in the 'real' reality? That's why the ending is so ambiguous: because it leaves Cobb in a reality that is as real as can be, at least for the moment, and the only thing that could make it unreal is his totem. But if he can't see if the totem is spinning or not, how can he tell the difference? I cannot praise Nolan's genius enough. He took a million pieces of information and build a whole reality out of them. A logical, fully functional reality. Now that's an achievement, and as some reviewer already mentioned, pure creation. I'm writing this after the second viewing, six years after the movie came out. As of yesterday, this is to me the most brilliant movie ever made. I doubt anything will top it.",10,1,3,13 December 2016
Black Panther," Gorgeous!
","I absolutely loved this movie and I can't agree with anything that the haters say. It's a combination of a few things - that's why it's so amazing. It has a decent story that is properly developed (unlike a lot of action movies that focus on effects only), the effects are mind-blowing, the outfits are beautiful, the sets are stunning, and I loved the acting. Why are people saying the acting was terrible? I actually LOVED how authentic the actors played, better than many white actors. And the accents are a great addition to it. Oh, and let's not forget the humor. There were a lot of effortless funny lines.
I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie if I tried. Brilliantly executed, fun, magical and at the same time real. Great filmmaking that everyone can enjoy, not just black people. This is how a movie can tear down barriers. Made me think of how much the world needs peace, how we need to get rid of weapons and make it possible for every human being to travel and see the beauty of the places that are out of reach for many of us.",10,2,5,3 May 2018
The Greatest Showman," Easy on the eye and the brain
","I don't know what the critics are saying, but I know why so many people disagree with them. It is surely a pretty production with great attention to detail, and if you liked High School Musical 3, you're going to love this. In order to like this movie, you have to go in with a certain mindset because this movie doesn't aspire to be anything more than light-hearted entertainment. It instantly made me think of 'Sing', the animated feature with animals singing in a musical, and that one was way above this in terms of music and storyline. Here, the plot is as straight as a piece of stick, there is zero actual drama and character development of any sort. The only thing that happens is that P.T. Barnum loses his job and buys a museum, that's all the story summarized for you (without any spoilers).I enjoyed the music but yes, it's very pop and silly and for kids. Dancing is unoriginal and repetitive. And if you want to see how NOT to introduce the main characters' life stories in a movie, watch the first five minutes of this thing. Basically, it's a fast-forward version sung by the main character as a child - and the screenwriter didn't think you need more. Actually, the whole movie is like that - there is hardly anything to it, it's just a collection of beautiful images but there's nothing to make you care for the characters. All dramas are resolved with an imaginary flick of the fingers - one moment there's no drama, flick your fingers and you have a potentially dramatic situation, then flick them again and the problem is gone, and because the characters sing their problems away, you hardly notice anything happened anyway. What's the point of this? Hell, I have no idea.I didn't expect this to be some seriously ambitious musical, but from the start I was wondering, why a musical at all? I would've loved to see the story of P.T. Barnum as a proper movie with a plot. With all the money that went into it, it could've been something truly spectacular. As it is now, we don't get to see who P.T. Barmum was, and what he did, all we see is a bunch of weird people singing and dancing, and even that is an exaggeration because most of those people are just kind of filling in, they have no actual place in the storyline, they're just dressed funny but other than that they have no reason to be in P.T. Barnum's circus. If P.T. Barnum's show looked anything like what they show here, nobody would go to see it.Why did they use Barnum at all? Why not simply do a movie about SOME showman and his band of singing dancers? It actually doesn't matter that those people are freaks because that bit isn't explored at all. In the 21st century you'd imagine that this would be the perfect opportunity to squeeze in every controversial topic if you have a fat bearded woman here and an interracial couple, and a few other misfits. And yet, a circus that bases its feeling of family on the fact that they're all freaks, surprisingly avoids any real treatment of those various issues.There was more social commentary in 'Three billboards' - and that one wasn't impressive either.Honestly, the worst thing about this movie is that they involved the actual greatest showman and didn't tell his story AT ALL. The only thing in common he has with the main character is the name and his circus. I didn't expect a historically accurate movie detailing all the turns of the man's life but come on, at least if you're setting the whole thing in the times when he lived, then show what life was like then? The British queen that he meets is probably the single thing that tells you that oh, this is the 19th century. And what's with the computer-generated elephants twice the size of the actual animal in real life? Seriously, they couldn't get a live elephant to walk a few steps on the set? This movie is best described, in my opinion, as rainbow cotton candy - it is that colorful and sweet, and it has just as much depth in any way whatsoever.
I would've given it fewer stars but it does have beautiful sets, the costumes are amazing, the acting is good, and you'll probably feel a little bit happier after watching this.",5,5,11,22 March 2018
