The New World," I don't get it!
","Why is it that if a director make one or two great movies that people always like all the movies of that director. I don't get that! This movie was s....l....o....w, very slow! I mean really slow. Sl..o....w.......snore.....snore.......Oh, I'm sorry.....I was sleeping! We will have to Wait 20 years for maybe a better movie of this director! The cinematography was great but that's all, folks! This was the first movie that I have rented that I pulled out of my DVD player after 45 minutes! Waiste of time! Go rent 'the thin red line' if you want to see a very good picture! Have fun!p.s. My girlfriend was sleeping before I pulled out the DVD! So girls, if you think Collin Farrel is a hunk....watch it.....otherwise... leave it in the videostore! Look nice on the shelfs!",3,1,4,3 August 2006
The Others," Great movie, surprising plot!!!
","The Others is one of the best films I've seen this year. I'm not a fan of Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge was terrible!), but her acting in this movie was outstanding. The two children did an excellent job too, their acting was great. The Others starts slow, sometimes it's more like a drama rather than a thriller. But there are enough moments which will bring you to the edge of your seat. The whole atmosphere of the movie was tensed, and the music was very functional. When you watch this film you think 'I'll know what's going on'', but the plot was very surprising. Go and rent this movie, you wont be disappointed! I'll give it a 9 out of 10!",Null,0,0,21 June 2002
Big Fish," Big fish.....Big movie!!!!
","This movie is just great. A fairytale with strange characters and a great story. I must say, stories. Because this movie will present you different stories, beautiful directed by Tim Burton. Well acted and visually very strong. I wasn't impressed by 'planet of the apes' and 'Edward Scissorhand' but with 'Big Fish' Tim Burton has a new fan on his side. I just loved it. Not the mainstream pulp that is coming to us every week on DVD or in the theater! No, a beautiful touching movie full of laughs and tears. A story about a son trying to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths his father told him about himself. I'm will not waste any more time for you. So go....run to you local videostore and rent it. You won't be disappointed! I promise you! Have fun, enjoy!",8,0,0,25 September 2006
