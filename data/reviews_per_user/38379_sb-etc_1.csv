Blade Runner 2049," Tedious and cringeworthy
","This is easily the most tedious and boring movie I have seen for a long time, especially when compared to the incredible original. The huge amount of hype when it was released stinks of payola.The praised visuals are pretentious and way over the top, yet they don't deliver, there is zero atmosphere. And the script is cringeworthy. Weak and uninspired dialogues. Slow story dragged out forever. And as reward for staying alive through all this we get a non-solution at the end.Well, it's a Hollywood sequel, so that's what you could expect.",1,3,9,16 February 2020
