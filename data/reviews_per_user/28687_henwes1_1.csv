Skyfall," We who wants the old 007 back!
","The last 3 'Bond-films' are very disappointing. There is nothing that reminds me about Ian Flemmings James Bond, the good old 007 is replaced with Daniel Craig. I mean that the new directors have changed Commander Bonds role and history. The gadgets and the famous intro is gone! Only in Skyfall the intro comes to the end thats good, but what about in Quantum of Solace and in Casino Royale? Its gone.And when began 007'agents to get superman power? He fell from tall buildings and bridges and stands up again and keep fighting! That is not realistic at all, specially when he got shot and fell of the train, that was quiet disappointing. And in Quantum he fell down many stairs and landed on the hard floor, but there to! Up and fight again, i mean that Bond have lost his character. And Q doesn't even show off all his new gadgets??? What happened to all the good old stuff? I mean that the new directors should go back in the next Bond film, the 24'rd should be Ian Flemmings James Bond. Don't need to go back to the very, very old Bond. But keep his character and his good jokes in hold and the intro. With license to write i say. We who want the old 007 Back!",5,14,28,2 December 2012
