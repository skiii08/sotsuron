The Benchwarmers," good movie , when you have nothing to do
","i also thought this movie was going to suck , but turned out to be really funny , with lots of physical comedy like there's lots of verbal ones , all the characters are stupid and have their own sickness or defects what makes them funny, and being a little computer geek myself i really enjoyed the movie . had a cool cast , even napoleon dinamite that was a really stupid one , but not as weird as the guy who's afraid of the sun. i was kinda surprised that adam sandler didn't show up to say 'you can do it!!' in this movie where Rob Schneider stars. if you don't have anything t do , just wanna have fun , pls watch this movie you'll love it",10,0,1,12 June 2006
