Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," SOOOO Cool
",I don't what all the critics saw but I thought it was great.  This is the only Stars Wars movie I've seen in a theater and it's something I won't soon forget.  It explained some things I was thinking about and the special effects were sweet.  Everyone I know who saw it said they thought it was just as great as any of the others.,10,0,0,22 May 1999
