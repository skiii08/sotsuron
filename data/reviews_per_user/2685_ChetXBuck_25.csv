Moneyball," Entertaining, Fun, and Wel-Crafted Sports Film. Makes you love the game even more.
","After this year's amazing World Series, baseball fans got another treat with a fantastic film about how the game is played and how it could be managed going forward. Moneyball is a fine film and enjoyable for fans of the game and even casual baseball fans. The somewhat gritty story of a GM, played very cleanly by Brad Pitt, who looks for ways to win without a huge budget, is entertaining and inspiring. I had high expectations for this film and most were exceeded. The script is great and the film features the right balance of humor, drama and real-life action. Two thumbs up for a really entertaining drama that makes you ready for Spring Training to start!",Null,1,2,15 January 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brilliant Disaster of a Movie
","Rewatched this visually impressive, yet terrible film this week and decided to update my review...Star Wars is one of the greatest film series of all-time. The (original) Star Wars, Empire and Jedi are all amazing feats of cinematography and storytelling. They are brilliant and game-changing. I recently re-watched this one, The Phantom Menace, and it's a disaster on so many levels, but it earns a few points just for being related to the original films. The bad: acting, casting, accents, Jar Jar, the young Anakin goof ball kid, dry performances, stiff dialog, bizarre politics, terrible special effects (e.g. Jar Jar) and overall a laughable storyline. The WORST: The young Anakin kid is like a bad Nichelodeon character. Jar Jar is much worse than I remember, and I recalled hating his character before. Natalie Portman is a great actress as is Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson--they are all wasted here with terrible stiff dialog and no chance to really act. Blah. The good: there are a few great visual effects and the story has moments of interesting flow. Conceptually, this could have been a good film, but so poorly assembled and feels like a 'B' movie throughout, despite massive budgets for everything. One other good thing is that it is here just to connect the dots in the overall Star Wars saga. It's like the really bad salad you get at an event before you get your steak fillet entrée. You hope to rush through it in hopes the next course is better. Looking forward to the 2015 release in hopes they never make these mistakes again and get a whole new generation interested in this Saga... go back to Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Run from the Phantom Menace. I'd sell this DVD for $1 and feel like I may have ripped the buyer off. I want those 3 hours back.",Null,1,3,27 November 2014
Zootopia," Funny for all ages. Clever, visually stunning and fast-paced.
",This is a clever and well-written kids film with many smart moments for kids of all ages. The writers and director added a lot of humor that appeals to all ages. Excellent character development and set-up of inventive sub-plots. The Good: - Great characters - Well written story with good plots - Smart and positive messages - Complex story that appeals to adults (and kids) - Fun and fast story - Excellent animation The Negatives: - Occasionally too serious - Story gets very complex - Sometimes tries too hardEXCELLENT overall kids and adults.GREAT CAMEO VOICES.

Spotlight," Subtle and methodical. Great acting, but characters you do not care much about.
","Great films create a compelling connection to the actors and characters. You care about them as individuals and you come to love, hate or relate to their quest. Spotlight does not really deliver on this. It is a good film, and it tells an important story with an important message about the fourth estate. Well, actually, the film is also largely about the flaws of the first estate, second estate, and third estate, but the fourth estate (the press) is the one that rebounds from its flaws. This methodical telling of a true story about the importance of a vigilant press is rated highly by critics this year. It is a story about how the press, politicians and religious leaders all conspired to protect a terrible group of people. This is an important story in that we must prevent this from ever happening again by any people in our society. But the importance of the story itself is not how you rate a film. This film is well crafted, well acted and very well cast. But its mission is quite methodical and we gain few emotional insights about the key protagonists. The film deserves much praise in that it may help teach us to never be silent again when dark and evil behavior in among us. The mission to end this evil is important and for that reason, it is an important film to see. We can hope this film helps prevent future wrongdoing and helps people to speak out when they see things that are truly wrong. It is a very well-crafted film with an important message. The message may be more important than the film itself.",Null,3,5,22 February 2016
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Smart, Interesting Film Trips Over Complex Story and Direction
","I wanted to love this film, but found it quite frustrating from the start. Having not read the book, I avoided reading too many reviews--and found the story to be very interesting overall--but painfully complex. We never get a real sense of the characters--thus we can appreciate none of them personally and we don't really get much clarity about what is going on and what relationships are driving peoples' actions. The story would be much more interesting if the director gave us more to attach on to. But we both felt weary with the long and laboring plot and faded old school Brit characters to ever appreciate what could have been a great spy film. I have 100 questionsvand little emotion other than frustration after seeing this highly lauded film--Oldman may charm the Academy with his subtle character, but it's hard to care when it feels like you are watching a wax museum of spy films. We tried to enjoy, but left the theater with angst. Great story, painfully plodding and complex direction muddies it up!",Null,1,2,27 December 2011
The Hateful Eight," Moments of great acting, but painfully long and excessive
","A number of Tarantino's films are great. The over-the-top excess of the stories and characters worked brilliantly in Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Inglorious Basterds. Here, however, it's just too much. Think of it this way, while everyone likes a little salt on their food, dumping the entire salt shaker on your meal ruins it. This film has an interesting premise, a unique story and great characters, but at times it's so over-done you may get bored by the excess.It's also way too long. It clocks in at around three hours on most versions of the film. That's way too long for this story. This is not Gandhi, this is a Western drama. Tarantino has been given too much freedom to run this long without a good reason. In fact, the film would likely be a full star better if they cut 30-40 minutes from it. On the positive side, the characters are often brilliant and the acting is top notch. But the story is so over-the-top and excessive that we found ourselves rolling our eyes and losing interest too much for a film like this. Some moments of the film are a 9, others a 5, so the average score of a 7 fits for now. This is sad because had they made it more compact and shown a little restraint--this film could have been a 9 and of the best of 2015.Great concepts and great acting, but badly flawed execution hurt this film.",Null,0,1,2 April 2016
Moana," Color by numbers kids film. Borrows from many others. Good for kids.
","We saw this with our 2-year old. She enjoyed it. It's compared to Frozen and has some of the same producers. However, this film is no Frozen. While it follows a similar structure to Frozen, the 'color by numbers' themes, songs, and production feel a bit tired. I enjoy the South Pacific theme and feel they could have made this a great film, but they have made a good film that is good for kids. This empowered character uses the 'sea' where Frozen used ice. The main songs are soaring, but not as memorable as Frozen. The 'radio versions' of the songs seem overly commercial. The main male character's complexity is vastly cartoonish and overplayed. He's bad, then good. Ego- maniac, then humble. Moana is a sweet and empowering character that works well, but the story around her gets increasingly absurd and zany. Sorry, this is only a good film, not a great one.",Null,1,10,18 December 2016
Jackie," Great acting. Important subject. Too dark at times. RFK is all wrong.
","Natalie Portman is very good in the lead role and will get lots of acting recognition. The JFK story is amazingly compelling and still has many nuances to his story even though it has been told many times. This is a very different portrait of the era focused on Jackie and Natalie Portman draws an amazing portrait. Peter Sarsgaard is a bit sloppy as RFK and does not attempt the accent nor the charm that RFK is known for. This film paints a brilliant picture, but if differs so much from other known accounts of RFK and the other family members that it seems jaded against telling the real story of the Kennedy's. The film centers around dialogue between Jackie and a reporter narrative that is often awkward, flawed and beyond belief. The film is largely devoid of 'warm' characters and many of the relationships feel false and plastic beyond reason. Many things are implied here about LBJ, Lee Harvey Oswald and others that leaves you a bit confused about where the film wants you to focus. This could have been a great film, but I will say it was misguided in the way it told the story... too dark, too foreboding and too many dry characters.",Null,0,4,6 January 2017
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Great Innovative Action Sequel, Good Characters. MUST see in IMAX. Superb Visuals!
","MI:4 Exceeded my high expectations for a powerhouse action sequel. The story was complex, but still clear enough for most to follow. The high-wire building sequence is heart-pounding and the new members of the cast Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton add some unique angles to the story, with Simon Pegg adding excellent comic relief. Much of the film was recorded on IMAX cameras--so IMAX theaters are the best way to see this visual spectacle. The fast and smart pace of the film keeps you fully engaged thanks to director Brad Bird. Many of the action heroics push the envelope on believability, but they are so well executed that you can suspend disbelief enough to thoroughly enjoy this dynamic popcorn action film. As much as the pop culture world like to rough up Tom Cruise--he's at his best in this film. He's a solid performer as an action hero, does his own stunts and co-produced the film. He's got a mega hit on his hands here and we worked hard to make this film a great one.",Null,3,7,2 January 2012
28 Days Later...," AMAZINGLY SCARY FILM
","I am not easily scared. This film is terrifying. Truly. There were a number of points during this realistic and stunning cinematic journey where I was ready to head for the exit out of pure fear. Seriously. Many horror films are so ludicrous that there is no reality to make you really scared. This film borders on a real, hands-on fright that you get pulled in immediately to this alternative, low budget nightmare. If you want to be scared, go! The newly released 2nd ending is so-so. The main film is brilliant. Go see it at a theatre... on DVD it will not be the same.",Null,0,0,3 August 2003
The Lion King," Visually a breakthrough. Favreau made a good, but not great film.
","We saw this in the theater and our 5-year old has watched it 10 times on Disney+. Visually stunning animals that makes you wonder how they did it. It does lack heart and could have been more fun. This film could have been a 9, but has to settle for a 7 as the tone keeps confusing the viewer. Worth a watching, but probably not as many times as your young kids will try to watch.",Null,0,1,12 April 2020
Clash of the Titans," I'd Like those two hours back... Below Average, cumbersome, poorly acted film.
","I recall the 1981 version of this film being rather entertaining as a teenager when HBO was new and there was nothing better on... now, thirty years later with a huge budget and lots of stars, the film falls completely flat with a painful script, nonsensical story lines and substandard special F/X AND absolutely no emotion, heart or clarity. Despite having some big acting names, this film is a complete mess. It's hard to follow at times, filled with senseless characters and a set that feels about as real as a bad Six Flags ride from the 80s. A lot of money and effort was spent creating this painfully heartless waste of time. There were a few moments where it looked like it might be entertaining, but it fell flat. Watch the cheesy 1981 version and avoid this modern mess. If you are over 15, avoid the new 'Clash.'",Null,2,3,24 January 2011
Once Upon a Time in America," Very Long, Complex and Compelling Crime Drama. Solid De Niro film
","We rented the nearly four hour director's cut of this film via Netflix. I had heard of this film for years and it's a top rated IMDb film. The story was very interesting and complex. The acting was generally solid. The highly regarded director created a visually stunning and epic film. However, some scenes felt rather plastic at times. De Niro is complex and superb as a character who ages generations on screen. The supporting cast all do their part to play villains and friends well. The hardest thing for me was buying the extreme violence of the youthful characters in the film. Their youthfulness and violence seems unrealistic and bothersome. At times, this crime drama felt like Jack Nicholson era Batman movies--too comic for a true drama. That said, the length of this film gives the director a chance to do an immense amount of storytelling and character development--which are all superb. Film buffs, gangster film fans and De Niro fans should definitely rent the four hour version of this film and make sure you have enough popcorn! 8.5/10. (Viewed in 2011)",Null,0,2,2 January 2012
Love & Mercy," BRILLIANT. Great story, great movie. Paul Dano deserves an Oscar Nomination.
","Great great movie. Compelling, amazingly relevant and timely. Paul Dano is a serious contender for an Oscar and captures a lot of the essence of Genius Brian Wilson. I realize this movie has some flaws and is not perfect, but it is worthy of great praise. The Good: Acting, great story, documentary style brilliance, time capsule of great music. Paul Dano is BRILLIANT. The Bad: Cusack is not the right casting. Paul G. is well cast, but chews a bit of scenery. Sometimes too long. Relationship story has challenges. Paul Dano is one of our finest. AND, it features PET SOUNDS, ranked by Rolling Stone as the greatest album in history, #2 is Sergeant Pepper.",Null,2,3,6 January 2016
Sicario," Great cast, but lots of flaws in direction. Interesting storyline. Not a great film.
","I had high hopes for this film which is winning awards and getting some Oscar buzz. The cast is amazing and the storyline is very interesting. However, there are some very gross flaws in the direction and characters in the film that caused me to give it a 7 (maybe even a 6) out of 10. The handful of great moments of intensity make it worth a 7, but this is not a best picture nominee. Without giving away any spoilers, I can say the following: THE BAD:* Emily Blunt character does (or fails to do) what you expect she would. She fails to ask questions or show some basic skills you would expect for someone in her position. * She is not believable in her professional or personal behavior. We don't really get her. Yes, she's conflicted, but there are 4-5 times where it makes no sense. * The story gets confusing and convoluted. Who are they going after and how and why and how does it all work out. Beyond implausible, it's like they edited 50% of the film away and left us with some gaping holes. * Governmental agencies are jumbled and confusing to an absurd level. * A few action scenes are absurd. * Random locations with random people where you do not know who they are nor why they are there.What I love about feature films in theaters is the level of realism, acting and storytelling is generally FAR superior to any TV show or movie. In this case, the director handles the character development and action scenes more like a TV movie. The cave scene being the most absurd and the main character (Emily Blunt) feeling like a poorly written TV character. Benicio and Josh Brolin have their moments of greatness, but their characters are too gruff to care much about them. There is another storyline about a Mexican police officer that is also poorly developed. THE GOOD: You will feel like you understand the complexity of the Mexico-US drug crisis. For those who feel doing illegal drugs does not harm anyone, this movie will give you a clear picture of the dangers to society and the corruption that exists along the border. Clearly, we have major issues that must be addressed.",Null,1,2,6 January 2016
Jack Reacher," Complex and Layered Story, Nice Moments, but Falls Flat by the end
","I wanted to like this film, but could only give it a 6 out of 10. It had great potential... a highly regarded book, complex story and characters and some good actors. But it feels over-long and has too many twists and turns. The big issue is that we do not really understand the motivations of the lead characters and some of the side characters are not believable. The concept of the film and the complex story about solving the crime have a few 'aha' moments, mostly related to plot twists. But by the end of the film I felt fatigued and cared little about the characters. The biggest issue is the relationships between various key characters... I won't say any more because it would be a spoiler, but in the end, we just don't know why people do what they do or feel what they feel... In some ways, a '6' is generous. I was disappointed. That said, if you like the book--see the film. It's stylish and unique. Just not that good.",Null,0,4,11 April 2013
Les Misérables," An Epic, Powerful and Long Acting Lesson (But not a singing lesson)
","Overall, I'd give Les Miserablés the 2012 movie a big thumbs up. I've seen the musical five times, three of which were on Broadway. I own the original cast recording and have listened to it probably 40 times. But I was unsure what to expect when Tom Hooper tried to convert it to the big screen. However, this is director Tom Hooper (director of Oscar Best Picture winner, 'The Kings Speech') with a cast of superstars (Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen, etc.) Hooper is an expert at both driving awesome character acting and historic epic drama. Which will he focus on for Les Mis? And what about the fact that this is the biggest 'musical' of all-time and has millions of devotees worldwide---how do you keep them happy too?Well, they way I look at it, it's like the Designated Hitter in baseball. You focus on acting or on singing. The DH would be like having actual Broadway style singers sing and actual Hollywood actors act... they have their role (AL style.) To ask a pure actor (e.g. Russell Crowe) to sing would be like having pitchers bat (NL style.) So, in effect, you can't easily excel at both. You must choose. Hooper chose actors to act and sing and decided to film them live for each scene, obtaining raw facial expressions and emotions, but sacrificing quality of voice.As a result of this epic confluence of film, I decided to pick ten things I like about Les Mis (2012) and an equal number of things that do not work. In brief, here they are the ten that work. Will post 10 that do not separately.This is a three-hour film and nearly four-hour musical, so there's a lot to discuss.This will only make sense if you've seen the new movie or know the musical, story or book: CONTAINS SPOILERS > 10 Things that Work: <1) Crisp, Great Storytelling: Director Hooper manages to make this absurdly complex story with dozens of characters flow very, very well. Even if you've seen the musical, the characters and story flow and come alive very well. I found a number of people who did not know the story (amazingly) and this movie was a solid introduction to the story. He deserves an Oscar nomination just for making this movie work on screen, not because it's the best film of the year.2) Hugh Jackman is brilliant in almost every way. Wow. He hit both great acting and solid singing and was more than believable as the troubled yet loving Jean Valjean. His makeup and aging was very real, and he owned the character. Kudos to Jackman and Hooper for bringing Jean Valjean to life like never before.3) YES! Javert is complex, not evil. Most productions of Les Mis get this all wrong! They portray Javert primarily as pure evil. However, the complexity of this character--one who sees the world through the lens of the law and in the black and white of right and wrong--this nuance is often destroyed by the live show. In 2012, I saw a touring version of the show in which Javert is evil and vengeful 100% of the time. That's just wrong. He's not meant to be hated, he's meant to be there as a complex anti-hero.4) Éponine by Samantha Barks: Often in the Broadway show, the young new star with a great voice gets this role, so she soars on each song. Barks had both the emotional draw to understand her dilemma and the voice to sign it out right. Great performance.5) Sacha Baren Cohen as Thénardier: He's over the top, but so is the character in the theatrical production. Baron Cohen is perfectly cast and lightens the film when it direly needs his comic relief, midway through this three-hour film. I thank Hooper for casting him. Jack Black and many other similar comedic actors would not have worked in this role.6) The student revolution: During the live musical, the student revolution is part of a complex array of story lines that erupt in the second half. Often the rationale for their revolution and their loyalty to the general get lost in all the other stories. This time, it works. You can understand their goals and motives much better.7) The Paris and countryside cinematography: There are four or five awesome moments in cinematography that explode on the big screen. For those waiting to see this on DVD, forget it--this is a big screen movie and you'll lose it in your living room. But it's fantastic in a big theater.8) Saved by the Bishop. The storyline of the faithful and merciful Catholic Bishop changing Jean Valjean's view of the world is very important to the story. It's the turning point for the main character and often gets brushed over in the musical or you just don't believe the story. The bishop is sincere and believable in the movie. He also appears later in the film to remind you of his importance. Well played, Hooper.9) Action scenes and editing: The opening scene totally changes our view of the 'chain-gang' compared to the musical. You get how risky their work is and how truly imprisoned they are in their lives. The battle scenes are also strong as are some of the fight scenes, escape scenes, chase scenes and Javert's death--which is always a key moment.10) The Thérnardier's Inn: This scene is important in the musical to lighten it up and give you a sense of the role of travel and Inns from that era of history. This over-the-top version of the Inn loses all believability to exaggerate the badness of the innkeepers, but it totally fits and makes you laugh and cringe at the same time.",Null,2,3,31 December 2012
Steve Jobs," Painful. Misdirected. Off-track and dark version of a visionary story.
","After reading countless negative reviews of this film about Steve Jobs, we were reluctant, but finally decided to watch on Apple TV after it received praise for acting. Yes, there are some great acting moments. But to what end? The writer and director have grabbed some of the most absurd and off-key moments of Steve Jobs life to create a dark and mythical character. Why was the Mac great? Ignore that. Why was his push for design so important? Make that a negative. Why did he revolutionize the modern era? He was narrow and flawed. This movie would have you believe the whole era of Apple was based on a few childhood fears and an obsession for working too much. At times, it felt like Steve Jobs was running for president and the writer and director ran the opposition campaign. Dark and negative without any window into to why he was great. Good acting in a faux story that is focused on damaging a reputation of a visionary... this film was widely criticized and lost a lot of money... but it would have you believe Apple and Steve Jobs were the failure. We liked the acting... to a degree. But the direction was terrible. It built up three key speeches and presentations that changed Steve Jobs and Apple and our lives. However, it never gave you a taste of what they really were about. Even people who were Steve Jobs critics say this film overlooked his charm, visionary roles and personality. Apple sold hundreds of millions of products based on his vision... but in the end, this film just wants you to know that he was not that happy, not a devoted father, and not very good at relationships. Change the title and our historical knowledge of Steve Jobs and you just have a boring story of a man who was flawed. Steve Jobs was flawed, but this film is far more flawed than he was in every way. I hope someone makes a biography that shares the real story.",Null,33,70,22 February 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Painfully slow film. Lots of wasted talent.
","We had high expectations after seeing previews to this film and our group made it a night out to see the latest Coen Brothers film. Our entire group left the theater deeply disappointed. Slow story, bland acting, too much inside Hollywood nonsense. We are big fans of the Coen Brothers. What went wrong here? Too much freedom, bad advice, bad studio input? Who knows, but this film is a dud. I am shocked by the positive reviews here and on RottenTomatoes. NOTE that user reviews across the board are not good. This film is Rotten. It has a few mildly entertaining moments, but the plot drags us into a strange Hollywood insider debate about who deserves credit from a bygone era. Cameos come and go and are largely wasted. I got more entertainment from the preview than the entire film. Watch the preview and be glad you did not waste a full evening seeing this bland and misguided film. Worth a 99cent rental on a Monday night on Apple TV? Maybe. A big maybe. Almost fell asleep about 75 minutes into this film. Boo Brothers Coen. Try again.",Null,3,7,13 February 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Funny Start... but PAINFUL middle and angry bunny damages film overall
","The first 20 minutes where we get to meet the characters (pets) and their families has some excellent writing and funny animal to human relations insights. The characters and story start off great and Louis CK strikes the perfect balance of the main dog voice. However, the film 'jumps the shark' with the introduction of the absurd set of angry and fake characters with Kevin Hart's Snowball bunny. Snowball is angry, mean, and a total distraction. Terrible writing and direction here. These characters hate humans and have evil and totally unfunny intentions. Without this unwatchable middle section of angry and mean pets, the film has a great vibe and worth a watch. I've seen it about 100 times because our 4-year old loves the beginning and ending. We often skip Kevin Hart's Snowball and the middle section of the film.",Null,0,1,23 March 2019

There are a few too many slow and silly times that make it not nearly the quality of the great Finding Nemo, but it carries a lot of the charm with it somehow 13 years after the original. There are times where I feel this film falls on some weak and simple plot movements--but that is why it likely fared poorly during awards season. This is a good film, Nemo was a great film.

Lucy," Surreal entertainment with some glaring flaws
","We were excited to see Lucy based on some excellent reviews. We made this a prime-time movie night selection as soon as it was available for rental. It was somewhat entertaining, but ultimately disappointing. Our take is that the first half was fun and curiously 'realistic' sci-fi. The concepts explained by Morgan Freeman were very crisp and enlightening (although a bit academic.) We were quite engrossed in both the academic and gangster story lines. About 2/3 of the way through, the film 'jumps the shark' with some absurd sci-fi leaps. We would give the first half of the film a solid 8 and the second half of the film a 5. Average is a 6.5, so we'll round this up to a 7. This film had great potential to reveal some breakthrough new ideas, but it lost its way.",Null,0,2,23 January 2015
Cloud Atlas," An Unwatchable, arrogant, confusing mess of a movie.
","Grossly over-acted, impossible-to-follow plot lines, absurd accents and the most jumbled editing ever. Boo! We had high expectations for Cloud Atlas. Unfortunately, our group of four smart and frequent movie-goers, walked out on Cloud Atlas after the first two confusing hours of painful cinematic failure. The storyline is complex, the accents are absurd and flawed. The six bizarre and pretentious plot lines jump around so poorly that you are dazed and confused. It's visually compelling, but nearly impossible to follow. Halle Berry, Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant 'chew the scenery' with horribly bad accents. The Wachowski's reached to make a complex book into an epic drama and they got terribly lost along the way. I read a lot of great reviews calling this an 'epic,' but it's a failure. There are aspects of the six stories that are interesting and the actors work hard, but this film is a mess. It's pretentious, long, arrogant and confusing for no good reason. It has been many years since we walked out on a film. About 20 others in the theater left too. We asked a manager as we left what he had heard from people... he said the film was very 'divisive' among attendees, some liked it--some hated it, and both groups felt strongly. He indicated the film had a very large number of walkouts by unhappy film goers. I wish I had better things to say about this film... The effort was ambitious and expensive (over $100 Million to make.) It grossed $9 million opening weekend and was described widely as a 'bomb.'

Thirteen Days," A Powerful and Outstanding Film--Capturing History with Dramatic Flair
","This is a fantastic and enlightening film. Dramatic, powerful and written by historians, the film captures the amazing story of how John F. Kennedy, RFK and his cabinet ultimately prevented WWIII with a brilliant mix of Cold War toughness and true human diplomacy. The story touches on the importance of JFKs presidency and his unique blend of intelligence, compassion and faith. Kevin Costner is positioned as a central figure in the film and does a fine job... partly as a headliner to draw you in to the film. Robert Culp and Bruce Greenwood capture enough of the Kennedy magic to help us all understand and believe that we are lucky they were elected and we may never see such an uncommon blend of real thoughtful decision-making and diplomacy in the modern era. For those who see Kennedy as a popular and maybe even lightweight politico, this film shows why he is often regarded as one of the best US Presidents. The musical score, historic re-enactments and actors are great. The story is engrossing and the direction makes a taut political and international drama come to life for any viewer.Everyone with a curiosity about Kennedy, the presidency or the Cold War will enjoy this well crafted film. Wow.",Null,1,1,14 January 2001

It is too long and too stupid for words. Hard to understand who gave this film high marks. I want my money back. The Good: Interesting Premise and great actors The Bad: a Totally unrealistic story that keeps twisting. The Ugly: You stop caring about the characters. One more good thing: An interesting soundtrack. One more bad thing: The description of the film gives away too much. Cartoonish and stupid.
