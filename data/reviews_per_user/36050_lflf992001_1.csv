One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Good movie!
","For a while, I enjoyed this movie, but I didn't like the part where Patch was chewing on the carpet. I know that all puppies and dogs do that at certain times, but I didn't like the way his mother got slightly mad at him. I do like the rest of the movie though. I was wondering where Cruella got all those other dalmatian puppies. All those dalmatian puppies were just so adorable. Go ahead and watch this movie if you want, but I like the 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure sequel better. At least in that film, Patch got to be the star and he wasn't as annoying. A dalmatian is the kind of dog I would prefer, but I already have a dog. Overall, this movie deserves an 8 out of 10 rating.",8,3,5,27 September 2007
