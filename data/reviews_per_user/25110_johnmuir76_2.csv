Iron Man 3," Downey Jr. always good, plot not so much
","I would say this is the weakest of the 3 Iron Man movies. Downey Jr. is good as always, but the plot is a hot mess. The movie could have developed a bad-ass villain to rival Iron Man 2's Whiplash, but perhaps decided it couldn't pull it off and left us with Iron Man fighting some real lame-o's. There's a lot of plot holes and internal logical problems in the story. The special effects, as always are good, but I felt disappointed by the end. The supporting characters were fine (Ben Kingsley does well with what he has to work with), but unfortunately its the same damn plot in every action movie this summer about the President or VP being in danger, which makes you feel like they're not even trying.",6,132,271,5 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Surprisingly Bad, but Fun
","SPOILERS The bad: 1. Formulaic: Abrams took familiar characters/plots/and scenes and repurposed them into a new Star Wars TM product. (and another Death Star, really?) 2. Feminist Vapidism: The new female lead is perplexingly better than every male in the film, whether it's teaching herself the force (Luke took 2 movies worth of training), beating a Sith Lord in a light saber battle on her first day as a Jedi, being a better star pilot than Han Solo, or more knowledgeable engineer than Chewbacca; all skills that she somehow acquired as a scavenger on the desert planet Tatooine? Huh? 3. Civilization is Blown Up, No One Cares: the new 'First Order' starkiller blows up no less than 5 planets representing the Republic (apparently they learned nothing from Alderan), and the characters barely care. Meanwhile, the Republic doesn't have an army? 4. Nothing says originality like the Nazis: the 'First Order' is based on the Nazis. Yawn.5. We could have had acting: but instead Han and Leia get to talk mostly about their idiot son and the dumb plot.The Good: 1. The backgrounds/visuals/landscapes: are beautiful. One department did its job.2. The formula: Lots of lasers, lightsabers, explosions, aliens. If that's all you want in a Star Wars movie, than it's a success.3. It's fast-paced: Lots of action: better than the soap-opera of the Prequels. That said, Abrams probably can't do dialogue.",5,7,12,29 December 2015
