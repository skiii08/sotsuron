The Legend of Bagger Vance," Another Masterpiece by Redford
","I never thought much of Robert Redford as an actor --he's fun as an actor, and he plays Redford well, and that's about it-- but he is one of our most brilliant and artistic directors. Like all of Redford's films, this one is visually beautiful. Like some of Redford's best films this one is also about life and death --old age and/or the coming of death are part of the resolutions of 'The Milagro Beanfield War' and 'A River Runs Through It. This is an unabashedly emotional and sentimental film, and that's great. No one does that better than Redford, without being Hollywoodish --mawkish and maudlin-- about it.",9,4,10,24 June 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," The best romantic comedy ever
","I am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, but this film is so outstanding that I've watched on video at least fifteen times, over the years. I deduct only one point from a rating of 10, and that's for Meg Ryan's slick cuteness. The Nora Ephron's writing is superb, Rob Reiner's direction (he has become one of our finest comedy directors) is outstanding. Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby are absolutely perfect. Meg Ryan is very, very good.",9,0,0,8 March 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," The best romantic comedy ever made
","In my considered opinion, 'When Harry Met Sally' is the best romantic comedy ever made. I would rank it 9-1/2 out of 10 --the 1/2 subtracted for Meg Ryan's 'too cuteness.' Great writing, great directing, great acting, wonderful story.",9,0,0,7 December 2001
