Catch Me If You Can," o.k. movie...
","It's amazing how a man who stole more than a million dollars can turn around and make money off of it!  He even gloats on the second DVD at how he was amazed he could make 10 times the money he ever did writing bad checks! 
Amazing!  Become a criminal and imposter, then, after caught, start up a 'consulting' business and make money off criminal methods used.  Then to top it off--have a dumptruck full of money from a movie/book deal!  Only in America...(and possibly Canada)...Look, everyone makes mistakes, but this guy shouldn't be allowed to make money off of his capers, especially since he wrote MILLIONS in bad checks. At minimum he should be forced to pay back every cent he stole.",Null,0,1,16 May 2003
The Fast and the Furious," Not bad movie
","I saw this movie in the theater and after reading IMDb reviews I wasn't prepared for anything spectacular.  But, to be fair, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought and ended up buying the DVD. I didn't mind the story as much as some others here have; I wasn't expecting a remarkable story in a car racing movie.  The acting, however, is TERRIBLE. None of Toretto's gang can act especially Toretto (Vin Diesel) himself. Some of his lines are terrible to begin with but the way he portrays them makes them one hundred times worse. (possible spoiler) I feel at times the filmmakers wanted us the viewers to root for (and possibly feel sorry for) Toretto stealing from semi trucks.  I actually found myself rooting for the truck driver with the shot gun because Toretto and his gang turn out to be scumbags. All that aside, the racing scenes are very cool and the cars make great eye candy.",6,0,1,5 January 2002
