Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually Stunning!
",I think that expecting an excellent dialog from a Star Wars movie is like expecting apples form a cypress. I expected a sense experience and it blew me away! I had the chance to see it on DLP while traveling in NJ and the effect was even more amazing! I'll have to see it at least ten times just to grasp all the details and to delight my eyes and ears. BTW: The choreography of the sword fights is beautiful! Mr. Lucas: PLEASE give us some DVDs! ;-) Christian,10,0,0,16 July 1999
