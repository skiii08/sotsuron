Miracle," I Believe...
","It's about time that Hollywood made a hockey movie using talented players instead of talented body doubles and cutting-room floor editors. This film was as good as it could have been. It captured the excitement of the 80 Olympics when our boys in blue took home the gold against all odds and that's a true film-making achievement.Kurt Russell, (though he won't) should receive recognition at next year's SAG, Golden Globes or Oscars for his role as Herb Brooks. He did a fine job indeed.The hockey action was tremendous, really putting the Mighty Ducks franchise and Youngblood to shame.This is the #1 serious hockey movie and Slapshot can take shotgun if you need the comedic sidekick to the best hockey movie ever made!",9,0,0,6 February 2004
