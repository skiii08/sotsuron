Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," The box office put this third because they did not see it until Brave and Madagascar Europes Most wanted was f1st and 2nd!
","Look at the old Dracula movies, then look at Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.So, which was better? Did you say this one? Then,why yes, you are right.Not because of the time,I mean if they want a GOOD Dracula movie,then they should of waited!In vampire hunter Abraham Lincoln is a strong character muscles and willed.The vampires are scary looking, if you see this in 3-D.The opening line was good, the one about history.The way Willie and Nancy Lincoln died of a disease they didn't have the tech to find out about.But, WARNING:do not mistake this for Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies, which also fitted in Nancy Lincolns death of disease.But the movie covers say it all, so it is unlikely to mix em' up.But still don't get them mixed up.Bot actors of Lincoln did their best, and that is really good. Now they know how to make movies with...well...different plot and make it good.Bet you this only was 3rd in box office because it is rated R for brief sexuality, but that happens, right? And it didn't lose to that Katy Perry movie and it is ahead of Prometheus wannabe alien, wheres Ripley? Well the end was EPIC when Vadoma confronts Mary Todd!How she uses her necklace as a bullet.So maybe it sounds bad but no it is good.Train scene is very suspenseful with burning tracks.In the end,ENDING SPOILER AHEAD! 'Where is the silver?!?!?' 'Right here!!! with that, Adam, the king vampire, stabbed by a silver watch.But sad because Mary Todd's last line is 'Come on, Abraham, we're going to be late for the theater!' But at the end is that... Obama that is at the bar watching the news report and getting all drunk?",10,3,6,11 July 2012
