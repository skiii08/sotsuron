Iron Man 3," Pretty bad, really disappointing!
","Im not gonna go into a lot of detail, just what I didn't like.May Contain SPOILERS One of the main things that stuck out was the whole movie Iron Man was getting his butt kicked. Literally every fight he was in he got beat up and in a few he was bailed out by humans and even a kid. Really? Now Iron Man has to be bailed out by a regular human child? That's one of the main reasons I hated this movie so much.Another reason I hated this movie was in a lot of the scenes with Iron Man Stark wasn't actually in the Suit, he was controlling it from far away... Yea WTF! You would think he was in it then they would show him in a different area controlling the suit. I don't wanna see that, I wanna see Stark in the suit kicking bad guys butts.Then there's the storyline. Im not gonna go into detail because I would be going on for days, but in short it was horrible. It was so far off from the original story.In all this was a mess! TOTAL MESS!",4,2,4,13 July 2013
Minority Report," Great Movie, Wish I Would of Seen it Sooner
","So I just watched Minority Report last night and I thought it was amazing. My favorite movies are futuristic movies, I also love futuristic cop movies. I also love Cruise and Spielberg, so this movie was my dream movie. I think this movie is very underrated even thought it has a 7.7, I think its Metascore(80) explains how good the movie actually is. I am starting to look at Metascore before the IMDb rating now because the Metascore is usually more telling. Of course the IMDb ranking is usually accurate. What I do is if you add the first number of the Metascore and the first number of the IMDb rating and it totals 14+(So say the IMDb score is 8.3 and Meta is 65 you would take the 8 and 6 and add them to get 14) than it should be a really good movie. With that method Minority report gets a 15.",10,0,1,21 August 2013
This Is the End," Hilarious
","Overall this movie was pretty good, and super funny. I don't recall another time when I actually laughed out loud numerous times throughout a movie. The only reason this movie was so funny is the cast, if you put a whole different cast in the exact same story line with the exact same lines it would be a horrible movie. There was a couple things I didn't like though. Like Jonah Hills personality in the movie was so annoying, this was probably my least favorite roll he has played. SPOILER The Funniest part by far was when James Franco was arguing with Danny Mcbride about cumming in his magazine. I was Rofling in the theatre. I really hope they do some kind of sequel but I don't know how they would considering what happened to everybody.",7,11,22,13 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Gave it 10/10(to makeup for so many 1/10's) but it was a 9/10
","I am a huge critic of movies, especially Star Wars movies, and this movie was really good from start to finish. It's not a spoiler review so im not getting into details, but this movie was great.",8,7,21,20 December 2019
Man of Steel," Good but have a few issues
","Overall the movie was pretty good. Im not gonna go into a lot of detail but I will tell you the one thing that stopped this movie from being great.SPOILERS The thing I hated about this movie and a lot of movies recently is the superhero(Superman in this case)is losing almost every single battle they get into. I also saw this in Iron Man 3. Anyway Superman lost pretty much every single fight he got into. He didn't do much fighting until later in the movie but once General Zod and his mineons got to earth Superman lost every battle he was in until the final one against Zod where he just barely pulled through at the very end of the fight. Cals dad said that he grew stronger than he would have because of the earths sun, so if he grew so strong than why could Zod and his minneons so easily beat him up? Also in Iron man 3 in the end of the movie the bad guys were beaten only because the regular citizen helped defeat the bad guys.",6,1,1,23 June 2013
Warrior," Really good but just missed being great
","I loved this movie up until about 30 min left, I still really liked it but the ending was just too unrealistic. So Tommy the younger brother comes out of nowhere and beats the best fighters in the world easily without hesitation, I can buy that. There are always great fighters coming out of nowhere. Now the speed he beat people in was unrealistic but that wasn't what bothered me. What bothered me is his brother Brendan, not the character but what happened to the character. So he was out of fighting for awhile and all of the sudden he joins a contest with the best fighters in the world. He was obviously older than all of them and hadn't fought in years. In every fight he gets beat the crap out of but somehow in the last minutes he pulls off an amazing move and gets a tap out. Literally every fight of the tourney he gets beat up badly but wins. Nobody can take the beatings he took and pull out a win, maybe in the first fight but not in 4 fights in 2 days. And when he did fight in the past he wasn't even good, they mentioned he was a .500 fighter. I don't know that just kinda ruined a great movie for me. The movie as a whole was really good though.",8,0,2,7 September 2013
The Dark Knight," Amazing, way better than I expected!
","When we learned about the new batman series I thought it would be a total failure. Batman Begins really proved me wrong, and I was set up to be pleased if each of them was as good as Batman Begins. Lets just say this movie blew away the first one and 99.9% of every other movie ever made. Bale played Batman perfectly, the best yet. What really made this movie as good as it is was Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker. It was one of the greatest performances ever, he simply nailed it. Michael Caine was the usual Michael Caine, he was great. Another person that made the movie as good as it was is Aaron Eckhart, he played Harvey Dent just like I imagined Harvey Dent. Then when he became Two Face and his personality and whole character changed he nailed it too. Of course Gyllenhaal and Freeman were great as well and the rest of the cast. If you haven't seen this then do yourself a huge favor and see it.",10,0,1,14 August 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," As good as it gets!
","Lord of the Rings the Return of the King is arguably the best movie in the history of movies. It is almost perfect, if not perfect. Peter Jackson will go down as one of the greatest Producer/Director of all time. So many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen, but not this time. This is 2nd best movie series of all time, the only reason its not first is because Star Wars wasn't a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. But if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time.Im not gonna go into much detail because I feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. If you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. Finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it. Will they get there? If they do will they lose anybody else? What happens? Trust me watch this movie, along with all of your questions being answered you will also witness one of the greatest movies ever if not the greatest.",10,2,3,14 August 2013
