Hereditary," Good film, but it's all been done before
","When did horror films stop being scary? there are too many films like this nowadays that are marketed as horror films and then just aren't scary, that means you BABADOOK, IT FOLLOWS, SPLIT, OCULUS, THE CONJURING 2!! etc etc.
On one hand I am pleased that films like this are still being made, it makes a huge change from the usual Dwayne Johnson 2 hour CGI fest thats on at the cinema every week. Unfortunately there is nothing here that hasn't been done before, the director may (or may not) claim it's a 'homage' to classic horror movies but to me it was just a blatant a rip-off, all it needed was a kid that sees dead people, a man with chainsaw for a hand, a guy in hockey mask, a zombie and a burnt fella in a Dennis the Menace jumper!!
Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it and will probably go and see it again it's just that there was nothing original about the story, just classic horror moments wrapped up in a modern neurotic American family.
There were more laughs than screams at the screening that I was in.A twist of THE EXORCIST + a dash of DON'T LOOK NOW + a sprinkling of NIGHT OF THE DEMON + squirt of ROSEMARY'S BABY + annoying family = HEREDITARY.",5,0,2,15 June 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Same old stuff
","So here we are again, ANOTHER Spiderman reboot that nobody really wanted. Who'd of thought, Spidey was Tony Starks bitch all along. I have seen ALL of the other recent Spidey movies and this did not add anything new, i'm just glad I didn't have to sit through the whole 'bitten by a radioactive spider' story again. Although I thought Tom Holland was a good Spidey he's actually 21 NOT 15, why not get an actual teenager to play PP instead of adult actors having to play kids!! The story and writing were very weak and in general I found the whole film to be rather boring, predictable, irritatingly noisy with the usual set-ups and a less than threatening villain, also PP lives in the most ethnically diverse world ever!! this felt rather forced and fake to me. My problem with these heavily CG films is that you are not actually watching REAL people so therefore there isn't any feel of dread for the characters on screen, who cares if a CG teenager dressed as a spider is being chased by a CG old man dressed as a vulture!! I realise I am not the target audience for this type of film but at the end of the day 'a good film is a good film' regardless of the age group it's aimed at. I'm sure early teen boys will find it 'awesome' but it left me rather cold and underwhelmed. Definitely not worthy of all the hype.",5,10,23,5 July 2017
Split," SPLIT decision. Good but not great
","Let me start by saying that UNBREAKABLE is one of my favorite films so it's good seeing MNS doing something near to his previous best and although i think that SPLIT is worth a watch unfortunately it's not as good as many on here have suggested.For me it falls between two stools, it's not scary enough to be called a horror film or suspenseful enough to be called a psychological thriller.Basically the plot revolves around Kevin (an excellent James MaCavoy) a man with 23 different personalities that range in different levels of threat, from 9 year Hedwig to the soon to arrive 24th personalty 'the BEAST'. Kevin kidnaps 3 teenage girls and keeps them captive in an unknown location, they must now try to escape before the BEAST finally manifests itself.The stand out performances are James Macavoy is absolutely brilliant as Kevin, seamlessly slipping from one character to another and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey, the only one of the three girls who actually realizes whats going on and using survival skills that she has learned from years of being abused tries to manipulate Kevin's friendlier personalities to help her escape.......I found Casey's back story more disturbing that the main story.POSITIVES: Great performances, Interesting plot, Casey's back story.NEGATIVES: Too long, too many scenes were the same, the David Dunn twist at the end just seemed desperate, and when the Beast did FINALLY arrive he just wasn't scary and it just felt like a rip-off of An American Werewolf In London (but not as good)Definitely worth the price of a cinema ticket, just don't expect anything close to THE SIXTH SENSE or UNBREAKABLE. 6 out of 10 movie, 5 of those stars just for James Malavoy.",5,1,9,30 January 2017
