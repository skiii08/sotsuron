Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Laughed til I Cried!!!
","I went to see this movie today with my wife. I had high expectations,... but this movie was funnier than I had thought. I will not give away any secrets or spoil the movie for you,... so I cant really say to much about it. This movie is shot to look like a documentary, which adds to the humor. And as far as the people in the movie,... I really cant tell if they were actors or real people..... although judging from the peoples reactions, a lot of them were real people. This movie is hilarious,... but very crude!!! And even though most of the movie had me laughing til I cried,... a couple parts did offend me. BUT to me that is the beauty of this movie,... it picks on all stereotypes and cultures, without prejudice.And let me say one last thing,..... I have only known of this actor from the 'Ali G Show', which I couldn't stand. However his Borat character is great, and perfect for a movie role.",9,2,9,4 November 2006
Cloverfield," Im Sorry..... but, I Hated It!!!
","(((Parts might contain Spoilers)))I will be honest, I didn't really want to see this movie in the first place...... but my wife and some of her family did, so I went along.The first 20 minutes or so of the movie were so slow, it was hard to sit still. Then it picks up for a little bit when the Monster attacks. Then it just ends, and you don't know what ever happened.My problem is that, I hated the shaky camera gimmick!!! Granted, it did make me a little dizzy.... but more than that, I just didn't like the way it worked in this movie. You did kind of feel like you were really there,.. but I would have traded that for the chance to actually see what was going on, or actually see the Monster. Another problem for me was that there was no character development. I really didn't know any more about the characters at the end of the movie than I did at the beginning,... and as a result..... didn't really care about what happened to them. ALSO.... the guy 'filming' all of this, and doing a lot of talking.... think his name was Chud. He was the most annoying character ever. And hearing him talk constantly through the whole movie was painful!!! After all his screaming and stupidity, the best part of the movie was him finally dieing.The characters were bland and boring; the story was very weak... and not much to it; the Monster and the little creatures from it, were lame and fake looking... from what little you see clearly;..... The only good part was the effects of the destruction of NYC.We went to a late Sunday night showing, so there were only maybe 40 people there. By halfway through, I had counted about 9 people who got up and left. Before it was over, I would say maybe another 4 or five left. Which I have never seen that many people leave one movie. After it 'ends', there was nothing but silence. Finally you could hear people complaining, and a couple boo's. Although there were a few who liked it.It is up to you, if you want to go see it. But if you must, try to wait for DVD.",4,7,13,21 January 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Johnny Depp can do anything....
","My wife and I went to see this yesterday. I really wanted to see this, although I wasn't sure what to expect. My wife on the other hand, tried hard to convince me to see another movie. I won and we watched 'Sweeney Todd'. I really liked it, and my wife was very happy that I made her watch it.(SLIGHT SPOILERS>>>>>>>>>>>)The movie is centered around Depps' character (Sweeney Todd). It is the story of how he had a beautiful wife and daughter, and was the town barber. However a corrupt judge had seen Todd's wife and wanted her for himself. So he has Todd charged with false charges and sent of to prison. While he is gone to prison, the judge attempts constantly to win her affection. Finally he gets her to a party and rapes her. She then poisons herself. The judge adopts the daughter as his own, and pretty much keeps her a prisoner in his house.The movie centers around Sweeney Todd coming back to that town and finding out what has happened to his wife and daughter. He sets out for revenge. He decides he wants to open his barber shop back up and get the judge in the chair for a shave, so he can kill him. However, after killing another man who tries to blackmail him,... and a little later, a failed attempt on the judge,............ he pretty much goes completely crazy and decides that no body is innocent and that everyone deserves to die.He is helped throughout the movie by a woman who back pies (the worst pies in all of London). A woman who knows his real identity, and apparently had a crush on him along time ago, before he went off to prison. Together, he kills the people off one by one....... and she gets rid of the evidence and at the same time starts making some of the best meat pies in all of London.(End Spoilers)I am not a big fan of musicals,.... but this didn't bother me. The songs in this did a good job of telling the story. Plus, they weren't the usually musical songs....... they were dark, with some humor.Altogether, I was very impressed with this movie. Johnny Depp did a great job singing and acting. But really, the whole cast was great.",9,2,4,31 December 2007
Nacho Libre," Nachoooo Cheesy!!!
","First of all, I love all types of movies. I love good clean humor comedies, as well as raunchy comedies (Wedding Crashers, etc). When I rented this movie I knew this would be a clean/ family friendly comedy. I expected some cheesy kid humor thrown in, since this is a NicK production. With all that said..... This movie was painfully hard to watch,.. and painfully unfunny. After 36 minutes of watching I had already pressed the info button on my DVD player to see how long it had been. (only 36 minutes!!! my god, I thought it had at least been an hour or longer.) I honestly don't know what to say about this film. It wasn't the slightest bit intelligent. Not really much of a meaning or moral behind it. And not very funny at all. (A couple times I smiled,.. but not one single audible laugh!!! And folks, I laughed at the movie 'Elf', so it doesn't take much to make me chuckle at least a little.) And, although I expected the cheesy humor, the on-going 'fart' joke got really old.This movie was a big waste of time.",5,0,1,28 October 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Perfect!!! And a Surprise.....
","First of all, I am not sure if I have ever given any movie a 10. But I am giving it to this movie. I rented this movie the other night for my wife and I to watch, on my night off. I was kind of hesitant to rent it, cause I didn't really know much about it. I remembered seeing a few previews when it was in theaters here, but it didn't receive a lot of buzz. (And honestly, it didn't stay very long in the theaters here.) But I rented it,... and I am very pleased that I did. This was an incredible movie. It is smart, realistic, and makes you think... even after it is over.This isn't a 'polished' typical Hollywood movie. It feels real. The actors seem real in their roles, and not like actors. The plot is realistic. And the emotions this film portray are real.And as a person who went through A lot as a child, and saw A lot,...... the child abuse/ neglect that this movie presents us with... is very realistic and emotional. And my eyes did get watery during this movie, due to the choices and situations that were there to be made.This movie doesn't try to paint a black and white picture of what the director feels is wrong and right. It simply paints a picture and leaves the judgment up to you. Who were really the bad guys? Were the bad guys really bad? Were their intentions right? Or was Casey Afflecks character right in the decision he makes at the end of the movie?And the ending was perfect. Left you thinking and debating in your own mind. What would you have done? What emotions was his character facing? Did he regret his decision?Give this movie a shot!!! Definitely wont regret it.",10,2,4,11 March 2008
Saw III," Just saw SAW 3.......
","I just went and watched Saw 3, and I still am not sure what I think. And honestly, I don't know if that is a good or bad thing.Now if anyone has read my other posts, they might remember that I wasn't a huge Saw fan. The first Saw was very original, and was very creative....... BUT, the acting ruined the movie for me. Then came Saw2. I really liked this one! Better acting, still a good storyline, and more tension. (Probably my favorite in the current trilogy.)Now its Saw 3. The acting, in my own opinion, was some where between the 1st and 2nd. There really wasn't as much suspense or tension in the third installment. And some of the storyline makes sense, but at the same time kind of contradicts other parts of the story. And the ending really kind of pisses me off.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The ending........ although kind of interesting, really pointless. They leave the story wide open, kind of like an ending for Saw 3..... but than the beginning of a new Saw movie tacked on the end. However, there is no one left to carry on the 'game' in a Saw 4. No Jigsaw, and no apprentice.... I am sure that they can make a Saw 4, but I think that it wouldn't not be worthy of the Saw franchise.... without Jigsaw.END SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AND, if they never make a Saw4, that makes the ending to Saw 3 totally pointless.",7,0,1,4 November 2006
Stardust," One of My New Favorites!!!
","My wife and I just rented this, and both of us love it!!!It is not like anything that I have ever seen before. It is a fairytale/fantasy, but with action and comedy.(slight spoilers)It is about a town that has a wall that runs along one side of it. It has an hole in the wall that is constantly guarded because it leads to another world/land. One boy from this town wants to get past the wall to find a star that fell from the sky,... in order to win the love of a girl he wants to marry. He finally finds away to the other side of the wall and finds the star. The other side of the wall is a land of magic and witches, of 2 headed miniature elephants, of flying pirate ships, of kings, etc.The main story is about trying to return the star back to his town and to the girl that he thought he loved, within a week...... before she would marry another man.............. I will say this. Although I loved the whole movie,... Robert DeNiro stole his screens. I never thought I would see him like this. You will see what I mean.(end spoilers)",10,1,1,30 December 2007
I Am Legend," Alright movie...... Could have been better
","Okay, I would really like to give this movie 6 1/2, but thats not an option. And since Will Smith did a really good job,... I will bump it to a 7.The best part of the movie is Will Smiths acting. I cant complain about that. He was very solid in this, and not over the top like in some past movies. He definitely carried this movie through til the end. His interaction with his dog, etc..... was very convincing and you could imagine how he felt and what state of mind he was in.Also, the idea behind this movie is really good. (yes I know it is a remake) My problem is that this movie had a lot of potential,... but in my opinion it didn't capitalize on it. And also, where as most movies drag on for like 15 minutes after they should have ended,........ I really felt like this movie would have been better if it had maybe ran a little longer.Really wish it would have shown a little more of the 'dark seekers'. Maybe shown some flashbacks of the virus taking over, and people de-evolving into these creatures. Maybe a little more interaction between Smith and the main 'dark seeker'.But mainly I was disappointed with the ending. I thought it was starting to build towards something,..... but it never did.",7,0,0,26 December 2007
The Dark Knight," My Anticipation wasn't Disappointed....
","First of all, let me say that I really liked 'Begins' and have been waiting for this since I left the theater for 'Begins'. So I have been anticipating this movie for along time. And most times when you anticipate a film and have such high hopes for it, you end up being let down... at least a little. Not so with the 'Dark Knight'. If possible, this movie was actually better then I had hoped for.Also, even if you are not a comic book person, or even a cartoon person, or have never even had a interest in Batman at all..... you can enjoy this movie. It is not just a comic movie used to cash in on the characters popularity, and use over the top CGI. Nolan's vision of Batman (Starting in Batman Begins)is a realistic incarnation. Realistic characters and situations, etc. The Dark Knight has a deep story that is being told. It is more than a comic book movie. It could honestly stand on its own as a crime saga/ mafia type movie. You have a Batman who walks the line of right and wrong and starts to cross the line several times. A Batman who has anger and hate and wants justice, regardless of how. And a Bruce Wayne who is outwardly rich and a cocky person. But who is inwardly unsure of what he is doing, and if he wants to continue doing it. Then you have The Joker. (Thank you Heath, for this performance, and this interpretation of one of our favorite villains) We finally have a Joker who is evil. He really isn't out for money, or revenge, or power. He basically just wants chaos. He wants destruction and anarchy. He is a dark character. He constantly forces people to chose for themselves in bad situations, and basically chose between their life or another's. He isn't over the top and comical and somewhat cheesy. He is twisted, evil, very smart, and one step ahead.... yet with a very dark humor.Then there is Two Face. Character was played perfectly. Basically a very good person who also wants justice, and at times walks the line between right and wrong. A character who is tortured at a great lose, and seeks revenge, and is guided by hate and chance. >>>>>SPOILER<<<<< I only wish he wouldn't have died in this movie. I really expected his character to be left open at the end, for a possible 3rd installment. But I understand how his death fit into this films story. >>>>>End Spoilers<<<<<All together this film was great. Acting, script, music score, locations, lack of CGI, etc.",10,1,4,21 July 2008
Saw," Awful!!!!!!!!!!!
","Very simply, this movie sucked! It was one of the biggest wastes of time and money I have experienced lately! From The previews it looked creepy, but god was I wrong!\The acting is terrible. The execution of the story is awful. There really was no suspense. Really no gore. I feel like the movie was rushed, and didn't really go in depth enough with some of the background stories.There was way to much humor! Most of the movie the crowd was complaining about the movie sucking. The rest of the time they spent laughing! (Like when the puppet rode out on the tricycle.) Leaving the movie, I heard more complaining than I have heard from a movie audience..........ever.Now I will say that I like the idea behind this movie. If it had a different cast and better directing and a better script........this could have been a entertaining and creepy movie. However, as is, it is simply a movie to rent........and that is only if you are curious about the movie, and not really in search of a good movie to rent.I will also admit that I enjoyed the very end of the movie. Definitely a good ending! (Last 10 minutes or so.)",1,1,3,31 October 2004
The Happening," Smart Idea.......... Terrible Delivery
","I was hoping for a good movie. I was hoping for a good movie from M. Night Shyamalan, who I know is capable of a great movie, but in whom I have been disappointed with lately. I loved 'The Sixth Sense', and thought 'Signs' was pretty good. As of right now, I am not sure if 'The Happening' or 'Lady In The Water' is my least favorite. And unlike his other movies, M. Night Shyamalan doesn't have a role in 'The Happening', which makes me wonder if even he was disappointed with this movie.The idea was good and original, and I honestly feel like it could have been a great movie. There are many things that this film presents to the viewer to make them think, and in the end form their own opinion. Ideas that are indeed scary, and not that far fetched. Things that are hard to imagine, but not really that unrealistic..... which makes the 'Ideas' in the movie truly scary!!! However, in my opinion, the movie didn't capitalize on its own ideas. And the movie didn't even come close to capturing the tension and terror that would go along with its own idea/ story.(Start Spoilers) Basically after years of abusing our planet with pollution, etc, ... nature takes the offense. Basically the movie talks about how plants can produce toxins to defend against threats. Plants finally determine that humans are the environments biggest threat and starts to produce a toxin that targets the humans. The story goes on to explain that humans have a genetic chemical/ programing that makes us want to live and survive. However the toxins that the plants are producing, alter that 'programming', so instead of wanting to live..... we are programed to want to die. So once exposed to the toxins, we become confused and end with us committing suicide. (End Spoilers)Like I said, really creative (but not unrealistic) idea. Something that would be devastating and truly scary!!!But unfortunately, other than the basic idea, this movie has nothing. It is not scary. It seemed undeveloped. The movie seemed very stretched out, for the content that was made for it. (In current form, would have made a better 1hour episode for Twilight Zone or something like that.) The acting was horrible. I get that they were trying to be 'real people' in a 'real situation' and not actors in a movie. But even cutting some slack for that reason, I didn't buy them in their roles.Sorry, I wanted to love this. But in all honesty, this movie was painful for me to sit through.",3,2,6,15 June 2008
Zombieland," Don't compare, This movie stands on its own.
","I went a saw this movie on Friday. And from the very beginning it gets right to the story, action, and humor. And it doesn't really slow down til the end, at about 90 minutes. The 'plot' is explained early on, so you know what is happening and why. However the 'plot' isn't the reason for the movie. The point of this movie is simply the chemistry between the characters; the humor; and killing zombies. Jesse Eisenberg is good. He is great at a kind of awkward character/ comedy role. Woody Harrelson is perfect for this role. I am so happy to see him in a movie again. I think he is very funny, when in the right role. Emma Stone, whom I think is hot, is good in her role. Abigail Breslin, again good in her role. Interested to see if she can transition from a child actor, to a grown up actor.The movie really isn't intended to be a horror film. So don't go in expecting a dark humor/ horrow movie. It is basically a straight forward comedy, just having fun, not meant to be taken the least bit seriously.You will laugh at Harrelson's twinkie obsession!!!And I don't want to ruin anything. But I will say that there is a cameo appearance that steals the show. The whole audience was laughing so hard at this part, it was hard to hear some of the movie for a couple minutes.This was one of the first movies I have seen in along time, where after it was over, most of the theater clapped.",9,1,4,5 October 2009
