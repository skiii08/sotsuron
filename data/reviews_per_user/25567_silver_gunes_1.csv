Alien 3," Decent sequel
","The criticism about this film is not fair. I think many people expected the same approach with the first two films, which were very similar plot-wise and more action oriented. However, it came out as a more sophisticated film which is hard to be appreciated by everyone. Instead of mindless violence and action, Alien 3 is more focusing on the atmosphere and the main themes of the Alien saga; life cycle, reproduction, host and parasite relation, gender relations, humans place in the universe and some pseudo-religion and philosophy to tie all. In fact, the low point of the film was the amateurish action scenes in the latter half of the film which were obviously intended to please the comic-book type viewers but this does not distract from the film. All in all, i think this is a decent sequel even on par with the first two films.",9,2,5,3 December 2016
