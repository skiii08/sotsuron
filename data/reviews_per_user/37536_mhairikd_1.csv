Vertigo," What is left to say?
","Well, what more can be said about a film that is so effective and so haunting that it has been discussed for the last 40 years?  Vertigo tops my all time favourite movie list for so many reasons - the breathtaking cinematography, the amazing performances from Kim Novak and James Stewart, the innovative camera work and the sheer skill with which Hitchcock has put together his masterpiece.  I first saw it when I was 13 years old and even though I didn't understand it, I was affected by it.  Now I am 18 and studying Film and Media at university, I can appreciate why it had such an effect.  Vertigo typifies the very best of everything I am learning about the moving image, and every time I watch, something else strikes me.  I cannot describe accurately how I feel about this movie, but to say I love it is an understatement.",Null,3,3,23 April 2000
