Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," CGI vs costumes/puppets; Yoda kicks butt.
","One note about the CGI characters. With the exception of Yoda, the CGI characters looked more CGIish than I expected. This was certainly more noticeable when there were digital characters next to non-human characters played by actors in costume.One of the best parts of the movie, and certainly the only part that had people yelling and clapping, was Yoda duking it out with Dooku. It was a fantastic scene and it was great to see Yoda in action. He was the only CGI character that didn't look that way at all!",9,6,9,17 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Slightly Flawed but still a Force to be reckoned with!
","I won't go into plot details here. I have only 2 problems with Episode II. While I think Hayden Christensen does a great job, his character was written with a bit too much petulance for me. If his personality was a little more Hans Solo and a little bit less Luke, I could have seen Padme falling for him.The only other complaint I have about the movie is Padme's hair and clothes changes, especially on Tatooine. Anakin is searching for his mother and she changes into another outfit and rebraids her hair. I think she did it again after the memorial.I'm a bit confused about one thing, too. Dooku tells Obi-Wan that he wants Obi-Wan to join him against the Sith. Would he so blatantly lie to Obi-Wan and expect to get away with it? Possibly I missed something. It was a bit hard to follow, but I'm sure that repeat viewings will clear this up for me.Overall, an excellent movie.",9,0,0,17 May 2002
