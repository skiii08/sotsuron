Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Tribute
","I skipped school to see this one, and it was well worth it. Lucas has kept his style, and has not failed us. The opening credits made me cry, just seeing that yellow text again with the familiar music. The story, the flat characters, the action, the fighting, the force and the whole being of the story is exactly like the others.The points that I don't care for can be explained so that there is a reason for all of it. I hated JarJar Binks, he's completely annoying, but he is important to the story, so he couldn't be cut. The childlike stupidity and clumsiness is typical 90's, one of the two infections that made its way in. The other is Jake Lloyd, Anakin as a little boy. I didn't care for the acting style, (at the end all I heard was Yes! and Woah!) but Mark Hamil was not a very good young Skywaker either in The New Hope. I guess I expected a future Darth Vader to be a little more serious or dark.The other actors, namely Neeson and McGregor were perfect. The return of the orginial actors and voices for R2D2, C3PO, Yoda The emperor, and Jaba the Hut made the film officially Star Wars. The lightsaber fight at the end with Obi, Qui-Jon, and Darth Mall is like seeing Luke and Vader all over again, with flawless choreography and action.The highlights: the race scene, which has been compared to Ben-Hur. I loved it! You feel like you're right there with Anakin. The end fight (previously mentioned), the end battle between the conflicting peoples, Lucas using the cheesy film frame transitions, and of course the classic ending with all the characters gathering together in front of a crowd complete with the fuzzy blue credits moving at a unsure speed.I think it was fine, and Lucas pulled off something that could have been completely ruined by the current generation. If he is this faithful to the next two, count me in for buying the entire collection in 2005!! Go see it, you'll go back to the far, far galaxy like it was before.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
Citizen Kane," Deservedly the best film ever made
","Orson Welles' genius completed this masterpiece at a mere 26 years of age, battling the tyrant William Randolph Hearst to release the finest film he has ever and that has ever been made. Not only does the story line, the acting (carried with uncanny force by Welles,) the dialog, the photography, the lighting and the music amaze me with awe, but the fact that it broke the barrier in film in 1941 to become 'art' by a young genius who had no experience in film. It is the greatest accomplishment ever achieved in film, and should remain immortal in the film world.",10,1,3,28 November 1999
The Insider," Should Have Won Best Picture
","I have seen American Beauty, and I was quite impressed, however, after seeing The Insider, I was very upset to now feel the pain that this movie did not take home the Oscar. Not just Best Picture, but best Actor, Russel Crowe, whose character study of Jeffery Wigand (especially when compared to the type-cast role given to Kevin Spacey for American Beauty) was flawless. It is a crime this movie was not recognized. Among the excellent dialog, acting and music, is the cinematography, a wonder to behold. The limited depth of field, blurring and floating camera add to the chaos, the fear and the characters' emotion in such a way that has not been seen for decades. I truly believe this is the greatest movie to come out of the 1990's, and will hopefully be a classic of an older generation.",10,0,0,15 May 2000
Mystic River," Total Disapointment
","This movie is best summarized as a film with great actors making a terrible movie under the direction of an old, alzheimeristic wannabe that has lost his intelligence. Clint Eastwood has finally lost it. This movie is like three different stories spliced with cheesy, unrealistic, empty dreams. I want those two hours of my life back!!!",1,13,21,7 November 2003
