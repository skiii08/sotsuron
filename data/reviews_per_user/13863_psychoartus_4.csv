Angels & Demons," Book versus Film
","By miaThe story starts when Dr. Vittoria and Fr. Silvano, and the Nuclear Research initiates the Large Hadron Collider and captures 3 antimatter in a special vial, without this vial if the anti-matter made contact or exposed with the matter this would likely explode like the 'Big Bang theory' and one anti-matter can power up a whole city for many days.Some Differences from the book: Book: Langdon received a phone call from the Vatican and went to the Geneva. Film: Langdon was currently swimming at the pool and one of the Vatican Gendarmerie Corps told him about the Illuminati and asked his help in the investigation. Book: All of the cardinals were killed. Film: 1 cardinal lived. Book: Leonardo Vetra father of Vittoria Vetra was killed and the first who was branded with 'Illuminati' Film: No scene about this. Book: Vittoria was kidnapped. Film: She wasn't kidnapped. Book: The assassin was killed by Vittoria Film: The assassin was killed in a bomb of the car when he got his last payment and ignited the engine of the car. Book: Camerlengo was the son of the late pope, conceived through artificial insemination. Film: Carmerlengo was adopted by the late pope. - Only the Swiss Guard was in the Book. The story is okay but it was a bit fast and some were cut-off that the people watching wouldn't understand the mysteries within the painting, the sculptor, etc. It had the same plot as the Da Vinci Code with a lot of mystery within the Church and Rome and problem solving, and talking too. They needed to go to the first sign / symbol / marker before they'll know what would be the next one. Langdon explained the mysteries about Illuminati, the meaning of the paintings, etc. As I know they where racing against time but the thing was the time of the scenes were always around 15 minutes before the deadline. But what happen with some of the scenes before that? Yup they've compressed the whole book in 2 hours and 30 minutes so they really weren't able to act all of it to a film. They've just got some good parts in the book which is still not enough to make the movie understandable. I understand the movie because I already read the book.It had the same atmosphere and graphics as the Da Vinci Code except for the 1st and last part of the movie. Not all parts of movie was filmed in Rome but in Sony Pictures Studios in LA, California as the Roman Catholic seen the Da Vinci Code as offensive. I love the structure of library in the film which they film in Angelica Library in Rome, Italy (Wish I could tour in Rome). There was even some old car inside the archive library. And it still looks brand new. Is it still moving or just a model?The acting was still the same, some doesn't have any expression in their face whenever they deliver their lines or maybe that was required to them. And some characters in the book were not in the film. Lead actor is Tom Hanks whatever you saw in his acting from his other films it's the same thing. He's a very calm guy.I'm wondering if the book / film really pertain with some secret society that was against the Church. Many religions are against the Roman Catholic and other religion. But I've heard that there was a Black Pope in Rome but I'm not sure if it's really true.Overall: I still like the book than watching it. I can really understand the mystery within them because it was clearly explain in the book. But still, I wanted to see and curious with the scenery, places, mysteries passage way, etc that what was described in the book.",7,0,0,24 July 2010
Avatar," If you're going to watch the film, watch it on IMAX 3D
","By mindselfLast night was my first time.I sat in row K and seat 33. The screen's about 5 times larger than the average movie theater and by the look of the the sound system, the quality will be clear. You can feel the anticipation as people waited patiently for the movie to start. The 3D glasses I wore fitted perfectly and didn't feel uncomfortable at all, it's like the glasses were never on. I looked below me to see the crowd gathering and the seats filling up. This was the first time I watched a film in IMAX, and in 3D for that matter. The tickets were a tad expensive, but I wasn't worried about that. I was worried whether or not the film will fulfill my expectations and hopefully not be a dud, but we are talking about James Cameron here.As I sat in my seat, I was thinking that I haven't seen one film in the theaters that James Cameron has made. I was far too young for The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, or True Lies and I didn't get to experience the Titanic hysteria, because at the time I wasn't interested. Nonetheless, I did watch all his films on VHS and on DVD.I remember earlier this year people of the entertainment community were claiming that Avatar was going to be the 'game changer' in film technology, especially the science fiction genre. Whether that's motion capture, CGI, or how we view and listen to the film, everyone in Hollywood was buzzing about the next epic film by James Cameron.I must say, this is a game changer.James Cameron's keen eye is very refreshing and honest. His ability to tell a story that's very familiarize and not quite original is overlooked by how each shot is full of detail and full of labor. A labor of love. Like Speed Racer, the film's heavily relied on technique and the use of movie magic. The 3D isn't gimmicky but another depth in the film. It's as if the people or the environment are right in front of you. Especially when you're in the jungle of Pandora and when the plants and trees illuminate, it looks real.The story itself is generic. It's how James Cameron execute the film that makes it unique. The story's similar to Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai, or even FernGully: The Last Rainforest. It's ultimately about how a person's perspective change over time about the indigenous beings and their environment. To learn about them, they must be them. Jake Sully, played by Sam Worthington, is a Marine who is paralyze from the waste down and is brought to the Avatar Program because his twin brother, Thomas, died. They needed a genetic match for his brother's avatar so they asked Jake to take his brother's place and continue their research. The avatars look like the indigenous beings, who are called Na'vi. In time, Jake will befriend the Na'vi, respect their beliefs and learn from their life style. The antagonist are the human beings. The very reason why humans invaded Pandora because of a precious mineral called unobtainium. Unobtainium is the 'McGuffin' in the film, meaning it has no purpose in the plot and it's just a decoy. Once you know that, you really don't care of it's use. Surprisingly though, the story has depth and a few spiritual themes about how we are one with nature and how we must respect our environment. Don't want to give too much away, but let's just say there's an epic battle between the Na'vis and humans at the end of the film.As for the acting. It's top notch. James Cameron cast a familiar face and a couple of new ones. Sigourney Weaver, who was in Cameron's earlier films, was excellent and brought her A game. Zoë Saldaña's great as a Na'vi, even if you didn't see her as herself, she gave an impressive performance. Sam Worthington also gave an impressive performance as a human and Na'vi. Everything I've seen with him so far has been great. The minor characters played by Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi, and Joel David Moore, were also good in their roles. I thought the most outstanding performance in Avatar is by the main antagonist, Colonel Miles Quaritch played by Stephen Lang. Although we needed to hate him, he was too badass to hate.The music's O.K. it's not inspiring, but it does move the film swiftly. I'll say there were 2-3 scenes where the music was benefiting . Other than that, it's forgettable.Don't have to mention the CGI because it's absolutely remarkable. You can't distinguish what's real and what's CGI in majority of the film. Especially the scenes when the humans interact with the Na'vis.Overall, If you're going to watch the film, watch it on IMAX 3D. Unless you can't afford to, watch it on 3D. The visuals are stunning, the acting is fantastic, the story is predictable but it's also fun. Watch the film solely for the experience. It has everything that anyone can enjoy. James Cameron is one of the few film makers who takes his time to develop a thoughtful and one of a kind film. Like I said, last night was my first time but I hope it's not my last. Here's hoping that film makers can learn a few things from Cameron.",8,1,2,24 July 2010
Inception," A Original Blockbuster
","By MindselfWhen it comes to studio blockbuster tent poles, this summer of films are filled with remakes, sequels, and adaptations of mediocre material. The public is itching for some sort of originality and volume, something to grasp and talk about in years to come. Almost ten years ago Christopher Nolan's Memento got critically acclaim for it's dark tale of obsession and themes of scarred memories. It also had a unique narrative mixed with a film noir style. After a decade of memorable films such as Insomnia and The Prestige, and the highly successful Batman film, The Dark Knight from two years ago, Christopher Nolan is now becoming a prosperous and renowned director in Hollywood. In my opinion he's one of the best directors in the past decade. In his latest effort, Inception, Christopher Nolan took those reoccurring themes of obsession and scarred memories and gave us again an unique narrative and style but this time he applied it with a summer blockbuster budget of $150 million (15x more than the budget of Memento) while satisfying the anxious moviegoers.Inception is an unconventional heist film that's about an elite group of people, where each individual has their own unique ability, so they can go into a person's dream and extract whatever information or secrets that they may have and a give it to their client for their own self gain. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays the main protagonist Cobb, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cobb's assistant, Ken Watanabe as their client, Tom Hardy who also assist Cobb, and Ellen Page as the rookie in the group. All in which acted very well but most notable is Tom Hardy who played the badass Forger. What is also noticeable is the vast differences in the cast, whether that be race, gender, age, or their many years in Hollywood. Each actor or actress brought an amazing performance for a film, that at times, is difficult to comprehend.Visually it's stunning and memorizing. Nolan knows how to cater to the crowd and he does it elegantly and unforced. His use of CG is unique because in some cases, he has the viewer fill in the blanks with their imagination. He doesn't take the effects for granted though. He also used practical effects, especially in a specific set piece that Joseph Gordon-Levitt was floating believably. His cinematographer, Wally Pfister, is also great. He didn't waste one frame and captured it's dark but at times hopeful scenery of several international locations wonderfully. I can't remember a film that attributes several locations and insert it as one of the plot devices. Nolan does it in every act of the film. Also the music by Hans Zimmer, who him and Pfister worked in most of Nolan's work, gave one of the highest energetic and at times suspenseful piece of composition of music this year. He also captured the mood and exhilaration of the film for each set piece with his music.As for the flaws, couple of the characters accents did get in the way of the dialogue. Also there's a couple of questionable plot holes or arcs in the story that wasn't explained well enough to make sense. Nolan didn't hesitate in creating a mythology within the film. When he established the rules, he does it so fast and well, we question what's actually going on at times. The opening scene is the best example for this. No doubt there's a significant amount of exposition in the film. In which, you have to pay attention to every detail of the film, whether it's explaining what's a person's expertise is or setting the rules within a dream.In all, if you're looking for a great time and want an intelligent but incredibly visualize blockbuster, then Inception is for you. Don't get it twisted though, not to over hype Nolan or the films credibility, it's a great film just don't expect it to make a whole lot of sense at times. Like I said, you have to pay attention to it's detail. Also he has all the intentions to set forth in making the summer blockbuster we all wanted, but it's disguised as being one of the most original and intriguing films this year. As you leave, not only will you asked yourself what just happen, you would like to watch it again in case something's missed.check out artisticalliance.org for more impressions.",9,2,6,24 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," This film resembles a CSI version of Sherlock Holmes
","by Marie AbayaThe Last week of 2009 and the theater was pack. It wasn't because of Sherlock Holmes just open but of Avatar. Everyone was lining up to see the new James Cameron film, but Audrey and I had a different film in mind. We have to admit that the line for Avatar look intimating, but the minute we enter the theater for Sherlock Holmes all that just wash away. I don't know the source material that well for Sherlock Holmes. I know growing up that he uses deductive reasoning and forensic to solve cases. He also has a sidekick name Dr. Watson and that they both solve cases together and frankly I'm happy I know so little of these Characters.This new age film directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Robert Downey, Jr as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as his helpful companion Dr. Watson gives that new fresh smell in a old and forgotten story. I can't entirely get into details on the plot of the film but the basic premise centers around a man name Lord Blackwood coming back from the grave and terrorizing the streets of London. It's up to Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson to figure out what Lord Blackwood is up too and how's he still alive after getting hung.Guy Ritchie style of directing is a hit and miss for this film, at times you feel like you're in 1800's London chasing Lord Blackwood, but there are moments where you feel like you're on a sound stage in a movie studio lot. The one thing that Guy Ritchie succeeds in is the action sequences. The use of Holmes deductive reasoning in scenes that doesn't really call for it made you feel that you're Sherlock Holmes and figuring out ahead of time what's the next step. The story itself is very engaging and the use of flashback to make sense of scenes that wouldn't make sense without was fun and very 'CSI'ish. I say this because the film itself plays out like a CSI episode. You'll get glimpses of items that are only going to make sense at the end of the film. Don't try to figure out the film before it ends, because the things they show you aren't what they seem to be.Robert Downey Jr. acting in this film can be compared to Johnny Depp's acting in the Pirates in the Caribbean films. He became Sherlock Holmes and you forget that you're actually watching Tony Starks, another Robert Downey Jr. character from Iron Man, and watching at times a disturb but brilliant detective. Jud Law does a flawless job as his loyal sidekick Watson and they both bring a charm to these characters that made you really like them. Another notable performance came from the leading lady Rachel McAdams as Holmes witty and beautiful love interest Irene Adler. She does a fabulous job as the one female character that can stand up against Holmes.The music from the film was also a wonderful addition. Hans Zimmer again shows why he's one of the top composers in the world.Overall, this film resembles a CSI version of Sherlock Holmes. The acting is top-notch and if you're a Guy Ritchie fan then this film is for you. It balances the action and humor in scenes that many films are missing today.",Null,1,1,24 July 2010
