Ford v Ferrari," A lot to pack in to a 2 - 1/2 hour biographical film rendered with speed and quality making this a winner
",It always amazes me when a producer/director can pack so much quality film into a mere two and a half hours with so much gusto and still maintain the gist of a historical and inspirational true story. Great cinematography combined with pitch perfect (location shoots in Italy) LeMans style car racing and an audio sound that makes you feel like you are at the track side with the roar of the engines and the squeal of rubber burning.It stars a great cast and the film is over almost as quick as one lap of the LeMans race track.

Child 44," I love a good ending and was rewarded for staying with this film
","It is progressively rarer to have Hollywood films storyline take place in a foreign countries war time era in the first half of the 20th century. Child 44 is one of those exceptions which combined the Stalin era of fear and propaganda (Example: The Soviet Union has no murderers and no homosexuals) in a totalitarian state with a purported child serial killer on the loose. Unless you have a fondness for reading up on your history of the World War 1 & 2 era, the first 30 minutes of this film may not relate with the audience as it depicts how millions of people were being starved to death and if they were lucky to live, they would be terrorized by the Russian militia. Child 44 stars Tom Hardy as Leo Demidov a security officer whose job it is to weed out protesters and anti Joseph Stalin revolutionaries. Leo recently married the beautiful Raisa (played by Noomi Rapace) who early in the film explains to Leo that she married her security officer husband out of fear and not because she loved him. I think the film's director Daniel Espinosa could have created a more personal film for his audience if he had effectively explained why Raisa feared for her life and so she chose to marry Leo just to survive thinking she had no choice in the marriage to a Russian security officer. As the movie progresses we see that Leo is not the hard ass he appears to be, and his love for Raisa is beyond reproach. As in any military regime there are men with egos, and who aspire to greater military roles. The scumbag who holds down this role is actor Joel Kinnaman who plays Vasili who continually tries to undermine his commander Leo by engaging in acts of terror against the people which include cold blooded murder and executions by military shootings against a compound wall which is plastered with bullet holes and his selected victims blood splatters. Vasili also has eyes on destroying Leo by taking away his job in the military as well as convincing his wife Raisa to leave Leo and come live with him. Through time Raisa finds out just what type of man she has married. Leo is a man who is very tough, persistent, focused on finding a child serial killer which his government emphatically denies even exists. Leo is also a man who truly loves his wife Raisa and would rather lose her by allowing her to make her own decision to stay with him or leave him without any repercussions. Two other good performances are presented by Gary Oldman playing General Mikhail Nesterov who Leo is assigned to report to in the slum town of Rostov as part of his banishment for pursuing a serial killer. The other good performance is that of Paddy Considine who plays the sly child sexual predator named Vladimir Malevich who picks up children at various train stations by offering them food and candy. Loosely based on the real life Soviet child serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. Chikatilo was born in 1936, who himself experienced between 1941 and 1944, witnessed some of the effects of the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. Chikatilo was a constant child bed wetter living in fear as a child of wartime strife and in his latter adult years was responsible for at least 52 children's murders which took place between 1978 and 1990. Child 44 focuses on the relationship between Russian military officer Leo Demidov and his wife Raisa, and how the slimy military officer Vasili uses his painful interrogation tactics to lie about his superiors (Leo Demidov) knowledge of his wife's involvement in the anti Stalins sentiments. The downside to the film for me was the difficulty of the Russian dialect for Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman in particular to achieve, and the use of a sub par grainy brownish colorization utilized by director Daniel Espinosa to influence the film being in the World War II era. I think the film editing should have been able to enhance the films end product with both the dialogue and cinematography but overall the film was both painful to watch due to the real suffering a world war is responsible for, as well as for a wonderful ending which I don't want to spoil for any potential first time film viewers. The excellent performances by both Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace will continue to keep them in good stead with their followers. I give Child 44 a sound 7 out of 10 rating. Child 44 will be on my 'TO PURCHASE' list.",7,1,2,4 April 2016
Rocketman," Elton John is amazing, and a complicated man....this film reflects his tormented side
","Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton John is superb and only heightened by the producers allowing Taron to sing his own versions of many of Elton John's classic hits. It would be impossible to capture all aspects of Elton John's life in the 2 hours provided in this musical/biographical film, so instead the producer/writer/director concentrated on Elton's early childhood which helped shape his destiny when he first met his partner in song writing the great Bernie Taupin played by Jamie Bell.There were far too many other excellent performances from the supporting cast members to mention them all but I have to mention two in particular who were top notch. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elton's irresponsible (wife cheating) mother, and Richard Madden who plays John Reid one of Elton's early but serious lovers remained Elton's manager for decades after their sexual relationship ended. Both of these actors added a lot to the films depth in the one area that focused on Elton's tormented soul and lead him to binge drinking and pill popping which is the area this film reflected.I hope we don't have to wait for Elton John to pass away (God forbid) before some producer realizes that Elton John and Bernie Taupin whose lifestyles and personalities are so diametrically opposite that they deserve their life stories to be developed into a (minimum) ten (10) hour TV Mini-Series to cover a heck of a lot of both of these musical genius's personal lives as well as their successes with their musical portfolios.Rocketman is well worth seeing and rates an 8 out of 10 in my version of Elton John's quasi autobiography book.",8,27,32,31 December 2019
A Star Is Born," A Star is BORED
","I am more than just a bit surprised how many of the IMDB reviews just glow about this remake, of another remake, of another remake of yet still another remake. In case some people don't realize it, this film has been over cooked since the 1930's.Maybe women love Bradley Cooper so this is his vanity project in which he is credited as the writer, director, and star. Heck, Bradley Cooper even went as far as having a Sam Elliott voice over by copying Elliott's gravelly voice and Mr. Vanity (Cooper) even gives himself several minutes of solo face time singing as a past-his-prime-time weary weathered alcoholic singing star.Oh sure, Cooper pulled out as many pity points that he possibly could by including his loyal dog pining for our over the hill rock star. While Jack hides behind his closed garage door his dog rests in front of the door resting alone and waiting for his master Jack to come out from behind the closed garage door. Awwwwww shucks. Cooper's screenplay denotes 'sappy sucker tears called for here'.I wish Hollywood would welcome some fresh new screenwriters blood with some really creative ideas for screenplays rather than just use bonafide stars to re-write old screenplays and re-hash old movies and expect us avid filmgoers who enjoy going to actual movie theaters to suck the old crap up again and again.I bet that more than half the people who wrote a praiseworthy IMDB review in 2018 for this film won't even remember who starred in this 5th version of A Star Is Born because it is simply not a memorable film, nor is it worthy of the bloated high praise it has been garnering. In reference to the great P.T. Barnum 'There's a Sucker Born Every Minute'...don't be the next one. Pass on this overrated remake.",4,808,1349,8 October 2018
Gravity," Gravity was a bit of a downer, (no pun intended)
","As most people have not yet invested in a 3D high definition television, I anticipate that the producers are going to lose a bundle on their eventual DVD release even if Gravity does well at the box office and at the Academy Awards. The best thing I liked about Gravity were the 3D visuals. The plot was not very believable. Let's try and understand what happens in Gravity. Sandra Bullock plays a scientific engineer who has received 6 months extensive training by NASA for her role as a high priced repair woman. There are a number of satellites circling the atmosphere but I had no idea they were sitting so close to one another. Hmmmmmm? Their shuttle receives an urgent message from NASA to evacuate their mission immediately and miraculously after being hit by a meteorite shower of space debris Sandra Bullock becomes the sole survivor. The audience does not have much sympathy for all the human casualties caused by the accident in space. Why you ask? Because there are only two characters in the entire 91 minute movie, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. George spends the first five minutes of the movie flying freely in space uninhibited whilst sitting in his space rocket chair.And so the plot thickens....but I thought it just froze and went nowhere. Of course when the meteorite shower of space debris nears their space capsule they dodge and dart every piece of debris but their comrades manning their space ship are not so fortunate.As Sandra loses her tether and is flipping 360 degrees through space George catches up to her in his space chair rocket and attaches her by a rope so that they can make it back to their space ship. Although George is the one who won't stop talking to Sandra as they travel through space in an attempt to make it back to their space ship, it is Sandra who runs out of oxygen first and needs desperately to make it back IN to their damaged space capsule. What happens to calm, cool and collected George? Well he just gets Sandra back to their space capsule in the nick of time before his rocket chair (that is right, it is not a rocking chair, it is a rocket chair) runs out of gas and his space suit runs out of oxygen so gravity just takes him away. Say goodbye George and say hello to the movie title, GRAVITY!So far Sandra has survived a meteorite space debris shellacking, a free fall through the universe, an empty tank of oxygen and her adventure is just beginning. She then has to survive her space capsule catching on fire, a second and third rotation of the space debris hurtling at her, until lo and behold she finds a Chinese satellite that she quickly learned to operate, although it appeared to also be out of gas.Sandra eventually finds a way to propel the Chinese satellite back towards earth and before it evaporates from the intense heat when re- entering the Earth's atmosphere, Sandra lands it in the ocean, and whilst opening the space shuttle door the water pressure submerges her and the craft to the bottom of the ocean and she then calmly swims to the surface.Two subtle changes I would have made to Gravity is I would have asked Hilary Swank to replace Sandra Bullock in the lead role and when Sandra (or Hilary) popped their head to the surface from the ocean floor I think the ending would have been great if a Sea-Doo went flying by them and smacked them in the head. Gravity was a bit of a downer.",5,2,4,27 October 2013
Wind River," A somber and stoic animal tracker still grieving is offered a chance for vengeance
","Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a big game animal tracker in Wyoming who hunts down lions to eek out a living. After losing his young daughter through an unsolved murder a second young lady named Natalie (Kelsey Asbille) is found dead on the frozen Wyoming Native American reservation without any snow shoes on her feet and she was raped and murdered. Cory speaks to Natalie's grieving father and personal friend Martin (Gil Birmingham) with great empathy after losing his own daughter to an unsolved murder. Martin tells Cory if he chooses to assist the FBI in hunting down his daughter's killer(s) to spare no mercy to these savage killer(s).When a rookie FBI agent named Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is assigned to investigate this latest murder on the Native American reservation land she quickly realizes that she needs the assistance of the experienced tracker Cory Lambert to just survive on the harsh and frozen surrounding white hills.I always enjoy these type of crime/drama revenge films if they are done well without embellishment of how awesome the hero/heroine is by miraculously defeating more than two dozen faceless lackies 'a la Steven Seagal. No, this mystery/thriller is void of any long winded overblown fights of one man versus an army. Rather, it focuses on how our experienced tracker Cory Lambert not only wants to track the person/people responsible for raping and killing his friend Martin's daughter but utilizing this opportunity to free himself from continuing internalizing his own grief for the unsolved murder of his own daughter. So Cory gladly joins the inexperienced female FBI agent who has never prepared herself for the harshness of the frozen Wyoming wilderness and they set out to solve the crime.Jeremy Renner always dives deep into his roles and unlike many of the made-to-model pretty boys who usually get these starring roles Renner's performance is both somber and stoic and you can't help but root for him and you know he is going to get these S.O.B.'s. It's a classic good versus evil cat and mouse chase but with a twist, this man is also on a personal mission to help ease his own personal grief for failing to save his own daughter and not finding her killer(s). He won't fail this time. Mrs. Shullivan and I greatly enjoyed this particular hunt and are even bigger fans of Jeremy Renner after his stellar performance.An 8 out 10 rating well worth watching!!!",8,1,1,10 March 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," May another farce be with you
","Okay, so Mrs. Shullivan insisted we go to the movies (since we were entering a New Year) and she had heard only great reviews from friends how fantastic this new chapter was in the Star War series. So we went all out and upgraded to the 3D film version with reclining theatre seats and waited for the film to start. Let me say that I did not mind the original 1977 film episode IV A New Hope, and even the subsequent two (2) films, episode V (1980) and episode V1 (1983) were passable theatre versions. But when the Star Wars film empire commenced with their Christmas mass merchandising effort and a continuous new epic (or spew yech) film every few years my own interest in the Star Wars series waned. Being the good sport that I am I agreed to get to the theatre early so we would not disturb anyone else and after sitting through 20 minutes of TV quality commercials, the movie started. The gist of the film is about a young five (5) year old Jyn Erso being instructed by her parents that she had to proceed in to her survival mode as the bad guys showed up to whisk daddy away so that he could complete building the ultimate laser weapon to destroy anything that the bad guys wanted to destroy. What followed over the next 15 years or so is the young five (5) year old Jyn learns to survive on her own and as a young female decides to find her father the scientist and save the world from weapons of mass destruction ....once again.If you like CGI and starships blasting each other out of the galaxy for the majority of the film then this chapter in the Star Wars saga will be right up your proverbial alley. As for me and Mrs. Shullivan we can sum it up in the following words: All hype and CGI and boring as hell. I give this chapter a 3 out of 10 rating and only for their marketing effort. I guess my personal review of Rogue One will illicit a lot of 'not agreed' responses as the 184,601 reviewers have rated this film with a overly generous 8.1 rating. By the way....the 3D version did absolutely nothing to enhance my movie experience, save your money and see the non 3D version if you must.",3,14,26,2 January 2017
The Rocker," No harm done, but not a memorable feature either
","Overall, I liked The Rocker, it had a decent comedy story line, and Rainn Wilson's starring role as a has been (before he was ever a star) rocker had its good moments. I especially liked one scene when he staged his comeback after a 20 year absence from the music industry. While practising with his new band and trying to understand how a web cam works he was sitting in his garage buck naked and mucking around with the web cam but he had no clue his drum sequence while being buck naked was going viral.Now he meets up with his old rock band who abandoned him 20 years earlier for their own fame and fortune. His old band members include SNL alumni Will Arnett,and Fred Armisen, and a wild looking Bradley Cooper. You just know that at some time in the movie there would have to be a showdown between Rainn Wilson's former band who are now rock legends and Rainn's new band who have a great songwriter and lead singer in Teddy Geiger. Teddy Geiger's road trip mom is played admirably by Christina Applegate.This movie reminded me of some of Adam Sandler's similar type movies. A story line with a bit of romance (the romantic interest played sincerely by Christina Applegate) the sad sack (Rainn Wilson) and the blossoming friendship between two of his new band mates, Emma Stone and Teddy Geiger.The movie is very light, and worth a watch, but it is nothing memorable either.",5,1,2,13 October 2013
Knives Out," A dark comedy/mystery with a first rate cast
","Knives Out kept me interested to the bitter end and just like a big bowl of my favorite ice cream, after I finished it all and licked the spoon, I wondered what the great appeal was all about after experiencing the same let down time and time again.It is a dark comedy and the cast alone is what makes Knives Out worth watching. Is it a great classic film? No, by no stretch of the imagination is it a great classic film. Is it a memorable film? No, I watched it just last week and I am already having difficulty recalling any favorite actor/actress in any special scenes or clever dialogue.I am though happy to be able to say that I saw this film and I can now with a clear conscience express my singular opinion of the film even with its stellar cast as a simple 'meh'.",6,3,4,10 March 2020
The Irishman," Badda Bing! ... Badda BUST!
","Is it just me, or is Robert DeNiro once again portraying the mindless and aging FBI honcho Robert Mueller from SNL fame in this lengthy biographical film????? He sure runs like a 76 year old man so why no stunt double for DeNiro?Pacino isn't playing Jimmy Hoffa. Every time he opens his loud mouth, Al Pacino is just playing himself. In fact a VERY OLD looking 79 year old over-the-hill version of Al Pacino. Sad. Terribly sad. Jimmy Hoffa is rolling over in his grave or he is breaking through 20 tons of concrete to stop a has been like Pacino ruin his reputation.Mrs. Shullivan and I were anticipating another long awaited Martin Scorsese 1960's-1970's period masterpiece crime film, but instead what we disappointedly sat through was an over-hyped, (too) lengthy quasi biography on just one of the many here say storylines on the 1975 sudden and mysterious disappearance of former union Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa.This film version of the missing Jimmy Hoffa focuses on three main characters, Hoffa played by Al Pacino, mob boss Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci, and the underling stuck in the middle of Hoffa and Bufalino, teamster labour leader Frank Sheeran, played by Robert DeNiro.THE GOOD:
Make no mistake, without actor Joe Pesci's strong but silent type mobster boss performance this film would have been most likely rated nothing more than a Grade B film with more than half of the finished product still sitting on the cutting room floor. Unlike the previous Scorsese directed mob films where Joe Pesci plays a raging out of control mobster maniac, in this biographical film Pesci plays a silent, very controlled, smart and resourceful mobster fixer who doesn't say much, but when he does, you better listen. I felt Pesci's strong performance and especially his one-on-one interactions with his underling Frank Sheeran kept the flame from going out on this otherwise forgettable and over rated film. Pesci played a similar role (crime boss) in the 1993 film, one of my all time favorite crime films, 'A Bronx Tale', which also co-starred Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri.THE BAD:
Why did Scorsese have the now 76 year old DeNiro and the now 79 year old Pacino play their respective characters Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) and Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) from their early days in the 1960's through to the year Sheeran actually died of cancer in 2003? The film would have transitioned much better through the five (5) decades of this biographical story line if two different actors had played a younger version of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Off the top of my head I could see Milo Ventimiglia playing the younger Frank Sheeran and Michael Chiklis playing the younger Jimmy Hoffa during the 1960's scenes and then transitioning to the (past their freshness date) Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino playing the much older versions of their characters.THE UGLY:
The film it's way too loooooong and boring. I understand that NetFlix has to fill in 24 hours per day for their millions of subscribers but to just fill in with extended and continuous chatty scenes that were just wasted minutes as were the smoke breaks alongside the highways and motels, ENOUGH ALREADY!Sadly, I rate it a dismal 2 out of 10. Badda Bing! Badda BUST!",2,267,485,23 November 2019
The Mummy," Just a notch or two below the great adventurer Indiana Jones
","I must have watched this film at least three times and I always enjoy that combination of an adventure/action/mystery/buried treasure themed film. The two lead actors Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz had great on screen chemistry. I am a big fan of films that have that great viewing combination of buried treasure and the chase to be the one who finds it first. Add to that adventure film combination a little fun, romance and of course some evil villains and with a good musical score you have all the necessary ingredients to have a big winner at the box office.I enjoyed The Mummy immensely and will most likely catch another run of the film at least a few more times, so get on your camel, wear a bit of sun tan lotion and make sure you have sufficient liquids to survive in the desert and sit back and enjoy this fun adventure.I give it a strong 8 out of 10 IMDB rating.",8,3,3,10 May 2020
Aquaman," Is it a good movie? Yes it is...... Is it a great movie? No, far from it.
","Mrs. Shullivan and I spent our Sunday afternoon waiting to relax in front of our TV while watching Aquaman and when I plopped the disc in and started to get involved with the characters we were both quite impressed. Nicole Kidman's performance as Queen Atlanna who falls in love with the lighthouse keeper Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) was a great start. The birth of their son Arthur and his eventual maturity into our land and sea hero Aquaman (Jason Momoa) was very entertaining as well.Willem Dafoe who plays Vulko, as both the principle advisor and conscience of the self-annointed King Orm (PatrickWilson) as well as the battle weary instructor to King Orm's half brother Aquaman is also a key role in the storyline.My interest started waning when we were introduced to the cartoonish raven haired sea queen Mera (Amber Heard) who although she was promised to wed King Orm, is obviously smitten by Aquaman and his constant grunting. It is about at this juncture when Mera and Aquaman are teamed up with Vulko in an effort to stop King Orm from proceeding with his diabolical plan to join all the sea kings under his leadership against the earth's surface humans to wipe us off the face of the world when we realize a battle is brewing. Up until this juncture the use of CGI was utilized sparingly and with good taste. As the two half brothers King Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Aquaman (Jason Momoa) are pitted against each other both feeling the presence of their missing mother Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) the film takes a sharp turn to the left and the writer/producer/director's take the cheap way out and rely mainly on CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) to complete their epic story line. So much of the same crash and burn CGI as in many other prior Marvel films it is quite frankly a bore.As the last ten (10) minutes of the film ending kind of redeems the preceding 45 minutes of far too much CGI, if a sequel is to be made Jasom Momoa as Aquaman, Patrick Wilson as King Orm and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna are worthy of a repeat, but I strongly urge the producers to forget about Mera (Amber Heard) and replace her with a more energized and realistic female lead that can act (boy was she baaaaad).I have assessed the overall film with a decent 7 out of 10 rating. The first half is exciting - the second half is mostly CGI and a bit of a let down, not like in the ocean but similar to a stinky toilet flushing.",7,1,4,2 April 2019
Concussion," This is a biographical story and now we know who Dr. Bennet Omalu is
","There was a lot of hype about the film release Concussion including many advocates wanting to see the film nominated for a whole bunch of Academy Award nominations and subsequent Academy Award night wins. That just did not happen and there are a number of reasons as to why.1. The film is good, but it is simply a biographical account of Dr. Bennet Omalu, a man who grew up in Nigeria and came to the United States for a better life. He acquired several degrees while continuing his medical studies in the U.S. He met his wife in the U.S. and they had two children. 2. The film is focused on Dr. Bennet Omalu as one of the city of Pittsburgh's pathologists and in the course of his duties he determines that the great Pittsburgh Steeler's Hall of Fame center, Mike Webster, death from a heart attack was actually brought on by how he suffered for years from CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy).3. If you are an NFL football fan as I am, you may be disappointed since the films' story is surrounding the struggle by Dr. Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith) to bring to the forefront the real violence of the NFL game of football which is every child's dream to not only be a player and part of the game of football, but to get to the top of the Monday Night Football game of the week, most of these children will suffer brain damage as a result of multiple blows to the head caused by CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy).4. Dr. Omalu wins over a former doctor of the Pittsburgh Steelers organization whose name is Dr. Julian Bailes (played by Alec Baldwin). Since 1994, he has been a neurological consultant to the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA), which has supported research on the effects of head injuries on professional athletes. He recognizes that Dr. Omalu is correct in his findings which is causing some retired NFL players to commit suicide to avoid any further pain and suffering not only to themselves, but the pain and suffering extended to their families. Between the two doctors they become very vocal in making the world aware (And especially the NFL players association) that NFL players are subjected to CTE.5. Obviously the NFL owners do not want this type of negative medical information to become the focal point of how dangerous the game of football is right from the grassroots of kiddy football, through to high school, to NCAA football, to the pinnacle of NFL football. So there is a tidbit of information in Dr. Bennet Omalu's life story that with a cheering musical score sounding in the background, we envision a David versus Goliath themed film. Unfortunately there are very few factual pieces of information provided through the film such as the stream of high paid lawyers that the NFL hired to get rid of this nuisance to their great game of NFL football and the billions of dollars of revenue gained by the NFL owners through the gate receipts, merchandise sales and especially the television rights revenue. I guess the producers were fully aware that the NFL owners and their lawyers had advised the producers to be very, very cautious about any and all information they included in the film or be prepared for a litigation battle between the NFL owners deep pockets and the films producers.The film's closing scene is the announcement that in 2015 Dr. Bennet Omalu received his U.S. citizenship. Not exactly an Academy award winning storyline. To summarize, the film did not do great at the box office and barely recovered the 35 million dollar budget at the gate. Fans do not care about film critics likes or dislikes, Academy Award nominations or not. Fans want to be entertained and simply put this biographical story on the cause and effect of CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) that was brought to the publics' attention by Dr. Bennet Omalu did not resonate into box office dollars, nor into any Academy Award nominations. What it did bring to light though was an offer of one billion dollars by the NFL owners to the NFL Players Association to resolve the matter in the courts. The NFL Players Association owe a great deal of gratitude to Dr. Bennet Omalu, but the film itself, is worth a watch for historical purposes, but not for any particular superb acting or storyline since this is a biography and Dr. Bennet Omalu's story is his own.I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating.",6,2,3,18 July 2016
The Hateful Eight," The Good...The Bad...and the Ugly
","1. THE GOOD: The cinematography which was completed in 60-70mm made for such a wonderful viewing experience for the audience that you have to watch the film simply for the luscious landscape and wide(er) screen vision that director Quentin Tarantino used with 60 year old camera lens to enhance the picture for his viewing audience. The abundance of so many quality actors in one film was especially a welcomed treat as well. Walton Goggins, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, Demian Bichir and Tim Roth all added to the films star quality.Consensus: I have not seen such fantastic picture quality in widescreen 70mm format since the 1968 film classic Ice Station Zebra. Additionally, Ennio Morricone won an Oscar for the film's music score which Mrs. Shullivan and I greatly enjoyed.2. THE BAD: A lot of Samuel L Jackson's dialogue went on far longer than required as did some of the dialogue of the other co-stars. Samuel L Jackson played bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren.Consensus: The continued windy dialogue sequences caused the film to lose some of its intended suspense such that Ms. Shullivan turned to me half way through the film and asked how many chapters were in the film?3. THE UGLY: Kurt Russell played bounty hunter John Ruth, 'The Hangman', and he was travelling by stagecoach to a town called Red Rock to deliver his captor, murderess Daisy Domergue, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh who had a $10,000 bounty on her head wanted dead or alive. Although bounty hunter nicknamed The Hangman was known for bringing his captors in alive so that he could watch them hang he just about killed poor Daisy before he would reach Red Rock with his continued physical beatings with his fists, elbows, and the butt end of his gun leaning harshly into her bloodied face. Consensus: The de-humanizing of the only female star in the film captor Daisy Domergue set back the woman's movement 50 years. Although Jennifer Jason Leigh received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her captor's role Mrs. Shullivan and I both took offense to the unnecessary brutality and continued beatings she absorbed. Having beef stew thrown all over her face, receiving the butt end of a gun to bloody her face and forehead, punched repeatedly by both bounty hunters was another unnecessary blow (no pun intended) to all real battered women. I for one did not feel her continued bloodied face entitled her to an Oscar nomination as her speaking lines were limited, not warranted of an Oscar nomination, and not core to the films plot which was to determine who was the gunmen trying to free murderess Daisy Domergue? The film seemed more intended to appeal to some viewers sick desire of seeing men batter women resulting in blood all over an ugly women's face. I must say that I enjoyed Quentin's prior western entry Django Unchained much more for its complete story line and entertainment value than The Hateful Eight which was a tad bit longer than necessary but still good enough that I want to purchase a Blu Ray copy for future viewing as we love Quentin Tarantino's complete body of work.7/10",7,2,6,11 April 2016
Molly's Game," Well done Molly! Well done! This film delivers the best hand in a Royal Flush!
","It is understandable that the producers would take some liberties with the film Molly's Game and portray Molly Bloom (played by Jessica Chastain) as more of a victim than a perpetrator of a crime(s). It is also understandable that it is near impossible to portray a real person's true persona on the big screen in only 140 minutes when their true story covers three (3) or more decades of actual living experiences. Suffice to say though that Mrs. Shullivan and I quite enjoyed the ups and especially the downs of Molly's game.There were some great supporting performances such as Bill Camp's performance as the serious poker player Harlan Eustice. Molly's professor father Larry Bloom was played by Academy Award winner Kevin Costner, and her defense lawyer was played by the superb actor Idris Elba. Graham Greene played the sympathetic New York state Judge Foxman.The film unfolds as Jessica Chastain who plays Molly periodically narrates her own life story to the film audience. Molly Bloom's narrative style works quite well in explaining Molly's lifestyle choice and how through osmosis and some strong female ambition she beats the men in a men's game/world. If not for a sympathetic judge Molly may have done some hard time in prison for her crimes at running an illegal card game that included a known criminal element at her tables in more than one state.The film ran for 140 minutes and I never found it to be slow moving at all. Mrs. Shullivan felt that some of the poker terms could have been explained and I heard the same concern raised by other movie goers at the film end, but eh, how often in a medical drama film does a doctor provide his/her diagnosis to a patient using a medical term and no one even cares what it means. The actual euphoria that some players experience after winning a big pot was never included in the film. However the despair of an addicted poker player who cannot buy a winning hand was quite evident when seasoned actor Bill Camp (2016 The Night Of) who plays Harlan Eustice insists to Molly to keep extending him a further line of credit way above his ability to pay back Molly for his hundreds of thousands of dollars of poker debt extended in one night. The desperation and fear on Harlan's face I have witnessed many times on a losing gamblers face and it is not a pretty sight.Molly's Game may have only shown the audience half of who Molly Bloom really was downplaying her drinking and drug addictions but it also portrays a woman who would not sell out any of the men whose lives would have been ruined even though none of them appeared in her corner when she could really have used both their financial and personal support when the Federal government was squeezing her for high profile names and critical information.Molly's game draws a Royal Flush and is well worth seeing at least twice. A perfect 10 for 10.",10,5,11,18 February 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Mediocre at best
","I do appreciate the historical value that some good movies are able to provide while at the same time also combining quality cinematography with superb acting performances through the portrayal(s) of historical figures. But this film does not provide a balance between fine acting and historical documentation. No, what this film provides in my humble opinion is a very left leaning political message.Adding insult to the intelligence of the producers/directors intended audience is the fact that the film also included actual film footage from the August 2017 clash between white nationalists and counter protesters and how each party blamed one another and the police for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Va. I am not objecting to the actual footage included at the end of this film, only that it displays an obvious clear bias that one party is racist and violent and that this film only encourages the continuation of hate amongst races based on either the color of one's skin and or choice of religious faith.As for the acting in this film Adam Driver's performance stood out, but I was less than impressed with either Topher Grace's role as the Grand Klansman David Dukes, or by John David Washington's performance as Ron Stallworth, an undercover cop. But what I was most disappointed with was the screenplay itself which was so one-sided that the audience was expected to believe that the civil rights movement origin was formed by the Walt Disney Mickey Mouse Club.For Spike Lee to receive an Academy Award for best Director, the year 2018 must have been a very lousy year in the entire film industry. The Academy members were obviously attempting to appease one group for the previous year's/decades of exclusion of the top awards but I expected to see much more from a film that received six (6) Academy nominations. Instead, all I gleaned is frustration from another film in a long line of politically motivated films that wreak with a one-sided view of a suppressed society. I don't call this entertainment at all. This film's only success may be in re-energizing the continuing divide amongst the nation.",5,29,51,12 March 2019
Begin Again," Great story, beautiful scenery, but listen for the fantastic musical score
","Ahhhhhh, another evening well spent with Mrs. Shullivan. This is a feel good film that was such a pleasant way to spend an evening forgetting the troubles in the world for a few hours. Mark Ruffalo stars as Dan, a former successful record producer who has fallen into a deep slump both in his business and personal life. Dan is separated from his wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) and rarely sees his teenage daughter Viloet (Hailee Steinfeld). Dan's business partner Saul (Mos Def/Yasiin Bey) has just fired Dan for more than one reason. As a record producer Dan still has an old soul for music. Before firing Dan, Saul asked Dan when was the last time he had a hit. I think Dan would have preferred to respond to his old partner by stating 'this morning'. But Dan would be responding as if he had heard Saul ask when was the last time he had a $hit, and not a hit. After being fired, Dan is binge drinking when a stranger on the subway hands him a pamphlet telling Dan that God is with him. Immediately after getting off the subway Dan stumbles into yet another music bar and he has an epiphany. He hears an angel singing named Gretta (Keira Knightley) and Dan envisions more than just Gretta on her acoustic guitar. This scene is both rare and memorable for both Mrs. Shullivan and myself. You see (actually the bar patrons don't see) Dan envisions in his mind while Gretta is singing solo on the stage, Gretta playing with the accompaniment of a full orchestra, which includes a drummer, guitarists, violin and a cello. Of course Dan cannot resist introducing himself to Gretta and advises her that she is going to become famous with her songwriting and singing. The film evolves with Gretta and Dan sharing their most personal pains which include their relationships that have dissolved. Gretta's old boyfriend who she lived with for five (5) years was a singer named Dave (Adam Levine) whose career has just skyrocketed when Gretta discovers that Dave has been cheating on her with a girl named Mimi. Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley brought their characters to life. They were so entertaining with their very strong performances, their personal relationship that it will bring the audience close to one another hoping for a happy ending. Music is life, and life is music.As they say, 'if it doesn't kill you, it will make you stronger'. So Gretta continues with her songwriting and she wants the downtrodden Dan to produce her first album. So a new journey begins when Dan's old business partner declines to produce Gretta's album so Dan recommends to Gretta that they produce the album on the city streets and landscapes of New York city as their sound stage. Gretta's only friend in New York a former London lad named Steve (James Corden) agrees to be their sound man for the album, and Dan enlists the financial assistance of an old client named Troublegum (Cee Lo Green) to hire a drummer and a lead guitarist. Through the making of their first album, Dan brings in the rest of the musicians which include a keyboard, violin, cello, and even his daughter Violet strums a mean base guitar solo. The songs that Gretta sings around the streets and building tops of New York city are stunning both visually and through the music score are captivating songs. Much credit must be given to writer/director John Carney whose previous body of work includes the 2007 musical film Once, and the 2016 musical film Sing Street. If you see the name John Carney in any film credit there is a much stronger possibility of a hit film. You won't go wrong with Begin Again which is a beautiful, melodic, warm and a feel good film.It is deserving of a 9 out of 10 rating.",9,7,8,12 January 2017
Black Mass," A deal with this devil garners you a free pass to a living hell in south Boston
","Scores a 10 out of 10 ratingThe crime film genre remains in good stead with the launching of director Scott Cooper's Black Mass which is a movie biography based on factual evidence of south Boston's number one crime lord of the 1970's and 1980's the vicious head of the Winter Hill Gang, James (Whitey) Bulger. To help prepare you for what type of crime boss Whitey Bulger really was there is an earlier documentary film released in January 2014 titled 'Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger' that is well worth watching for its in-depth insight in to the real south Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger before seeing Black Mass and realizing how well produced and acted the film really is.Johnny Depp plays the lead role of James Whitey Bulger with a hard to achieve balance of rare human compassion for his family and as a fearless gangster who knows no bounds in maximizing the physical violence he will dispel on anyone who gets in his way.It is always difficult to take a true story of a mans life that evolves over decades and capture the essence of the man in a two hour film but director Scott Cooper does an excellent job in achieving just that. It is hard to fathom that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would make such a ridiculous deal with a devil like James 'Whitey' Bulger and allow him to run rampant over south Boston in exchange for providing a continuous stream of confidential information that would bring down his competition in South Boston.Two primary reasons to see this film are the rich cinematography which is pure luster in color and the excellent script writing. There is also the benefit of a superior list of top notch supporting actors such as Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Julianne Nicholson and Kevin Bacon just to name a few. It is an all star cast with not one stand out performance since there are so many great scenes in this film.I would love to predict that there will be numerous Academy Award nominations for Black Mass but in my humble opinion the true way to assess most films authenticity of success is at the box office to which I predict Black Mass's gross sales over the next year will surpass all of its competition hands down, Academy Award winner or not. I hope I never encounter Johnny Depp knocking on my door playing Whitey Bulger with a deal of a lifetime...or with death.",10,13,29,13 September 2015
The Ottoman Lieutenant," So what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
","Okay I will admit that as far as action/adventure/romance films go, I have seen a lot worse, but after watching thousands of films over the past six (6) decades I appreciate viewing more than the run of the mill wide angle cinematic adventure with excellent color and a decent music score but that takes too many liberties with historical events. This film is a story about a 23 year old Philadelphia nurse named Lillie (Hera Hilmar) who comes from a well to do family. Lillie rather quickly becomes disenchanted with the class struggles in her hometown and infatuated with an American born doctor without borders named Dr. Jude (Josh Hartnett). Dr Jude is only in Philadelphia to acquire donations and to speak about the hospital he works at which is indifferent to the imminent first world war and whose sole purpose is to serve both the Turkish and Armenian soldiers who insist on either killing each other first, or maiming each other as a consolation. So Lillie abandons her comfortable living, cashes in her grandmother's inheritance for medical supplies which she expects to deliver to her dreamy doctor's hospital thousands of miles away. To travel to the hospital Lillie is assigned an Ottoman Lieutenant named Ismail (Michiel Huisman). Lillie and Ismail are from two completely and diverse backgrounds both in their religious beliefs as well as their customs.So you can figure out there is the makings of a love triangle with Dr. Jude (Josh Hartnett) and Ismail (Michiel Huisman) vying for the naive nurse Lillie's affections. I really liked Michiel Huisman's portrayal of Lieutenant Ismail and I was not very impressed with either Dr. Jude's medical prowess, nor with his continuing to put on and repeatedly take off his spectacles from the bridge of his nose. Quite frankly I would have preferred to see him continually pick his nose than to remove and place on, remove and place on his spectacles, it was irritating and added no value to his proficiency as a medical doctor.As for Lillie, she was quite attractive, but once again her abilities as a nurse working in a foreign countries hospital were questionable at best. If you must see it for yourself how poorly she behaved as a nurse look no further than the final scene in the film where she is outside supposedly attending to the wounded soldiers. She puts her hand on their forehead (some diagnosis eh?) as they lay on a stretcher and then she points them to one of three entrance ways as if that is going to stop their bleeding?I liked the film overall for light entertainment with above average cinematography and a decent musical score. The adventure and action sequences though were below par. I give the film a five (5) out of ten (10) score.",5,13,18,10 March 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Decent yet aborted film that is over rated as far as receiving six (6) Oscar nominations
","Mrs. Shullivan and I liked the film but neither of us felt it was a memorable film that was deserving of receiving six (6) Oscar nominations. Three Billboards also won two (2) Oscars for best actress in a leading role (Frances McDormand) and best supporting actor (Sam Rockwell) . Personally I thought Woody Harrelson who also received a nomination for best supporting actor was deserving more of the Oscar than his fellow co-star Sam Rockwell.I do not want to second guess the Oscar voters but Frances McDormand in my opinion was just playing herself in this film. If you don't believe me watch the film and then google her Oscar acceptance speech and then tell me if you do not agree that Frances McDormand's acceptance speech is exactly the feisty character portrayal of Mildred in Three Billboards. I felt Sally Hawkins performance as the mute cleaning lady on The Shape of Water was far more difficult to portray on screen than Mildred in Three Billboards.Three Billboards supporting cast also included some great talents wasted in peripheral meaningless roles such as actors Darrell Britt-Gibson, Lucas Hedges, Amanda Warren, Zeljko Ivanek and especially John Hawkes. The story line of a distraught mother who wants her daughter's rapist/murderer brought to justice and how she goes about pressuring the town Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to not only do his job, but his deputies as well. Lastly, I felt the ending was aborted purposely to allow for a sequel and another revenue producer at a later date to cash in on the six (6) Oscar nominations. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I for one am not very interested in a sequel to this average film that ends rather abruptly without any closure.",6,3,4,11 March 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A decent enough cast but with an aborted ending...does that mean an unnecessary sequel?
","Mrs. Shullivan and I were looking forward to seeing this move what with all the hype after receiving six (6) nominations and actually winning two (2) Academy Awards on March 05th, 2018. The cinematography and dramatic performances were both very good. We were however categorically disappointed in the outcome.Yes, Frances McDormand who plays a divorced mother named Mildred who loses her daughter prematurely as a result of a rape and brutal murder is distraught and frustrated with the local Ebbing Missouri police department who are making zero progress on finding out who was responsible for her daughters rape and murder, and what parent wouldn't be frustrated? However Mildred is not such a quiet introverted nor a passive mother. She is divorced from an abusive husband and willing to go to great lengths to literally push the Ebbings police department and especially the town's Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to put a heck of a lot more effort into investigating her daughters murder and to keep her informed into the police department's progress, or lack there of. I really thought the film had a strong cast including the likes of John Hawkes, Lucas Hedges, Zeljko Ivanek, Amanda Warren, Abbie Cornish, Peter Dinklage and Clarke Peters whose characters did not match up to the respected actors capabilities. In other words their performances were forgettable as they were peripheral roles in the film and the story line was suspect at best. Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand won an Oscar each for their performances, and Woody Harrelson could have and maybe should have beaten out his co-star Sam Rockwell for best supporting actor, and kudos to them all but I did not think this film was worthy of receiving six (6) Oscar nominations.Most disappointing was the abrupt ending after watching the film for near to two (2) hours which I will not divulge so as not to have to provide a spoiler alert. Maybe the Cohen brothers have plans for a sequel but that would be nothing more than sheer box office greed leaning on their suprising six (6) Academy Award nominations and two (2) winns to which I for one will not be fooled. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 rating but Academy Award recipient, I think not.",6,3,5,10 March 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," These 4 guys could go on tour as a QUEEN tribute band
","Quite impressive! The acting was top notch by all four band members. The sound and cinematography were also excellent. I have seen a few of the other nominated pictures and my vote for Best Picture is with Bohemian Rhapsody. This film has been nominated in five (5) categories and it would not surprise me if they won in all five categories, especially for Best Picture.Rami Malek is a chameleon and his performance as Freddy Mercury has guaranteed him that his next five (at least) pictures will assure him with a starring role and be paid as one of the most highest paid actors in Hollywood.This film as biographies go, is so well done. I think that this can be measured as a result of securing two of the founding members of Queen, namely Brian May and Roger Taylor as consultants on the picture.My only suggestion is I wish the biography of Queen should be made into a 10 hour TV mini-series so that the background stories of all the band members could have been explored in much more depth.This is a very good biopic worthy of an 8 out of 10 score plus a few Oscars including the Best Picture 2019.",8,2,2,24 February 2019
Burn After Reading," Brad Pitt should do more comedy like his role in Burn After Reading
",Mrs. Shullivan and I saw this movie when it was first released ten years ago. In fact we sat through the film twice because we were 10 minutes late and missed the beginning and boy were we glad we stayed and watched it a second time. This comedy/crime/suspense film is such a classic with the comedy style presented by both Brad Pitt and his buddy George Clooney. This is another Cohen brother film release so one does know what to expect (somewhat) with the Cohen brothers. The Cohen brothers usually move a picture along at a rapid pace with a gifted and creative storyline as well as with great music score and this film fits their method of operating to a tee. Brad Pitt plays a not too bright health club instructor named Chad Feldheimer who along with his somewhat brighter peer fitness instructor Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) recover a disc that holds some pretty important information that certain bad guys want back.So Chad and Linda figure they can maybe receive a kind of reward for the return of the disc to the (not so) rightful owner. When Chad and Linda get in touch with the foul mouthed alcoholic and retired CIA agent Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) I thought we were watching another sequel to the 1994 Dumb and Dumber films. Add to the mix Osborne Cox's wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) wanting a divorce from her husband so that she can move on to her current lover Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) and you have in this comedic mixing bowl enough nuts and bolts to blow the roof off of any comparable perfect comedy/crime caper.We have watched this film several times now and we will be watching it a few more times whenever we want a good laugh. I give the film a perfect 10 for 10 rating.,10,4,5,25 March 2018
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Kick-a$$ fairy tale which is sharp, edgy, filled with heroics and dirty deeds
","I didn't expect much from this so-called fairy tale story which was first published in 1812. If only the brothers Grimm were alive today to watch this updated story line starring the athletic and attractive Gemma Arterton as Greta, and her tough as nails diabetic brother Hansel played by versatile actor Jeremy Renner, I think they (the brothers Grimm) would be so impressed as to how the writer/director Tommy Wirkola brought their story to life (and death to the many witches).The supporting cast of stars such as Famke Janssen (witch Muriel), Pihla Viitala (good witch Mina), Peter Stormare (Sheriff Berringer), giant and lovable troll Edward (Derek Mears), and novice witch hunter in training Ben (Thomas Mann) were all extremely well played.I loved the darkish firey cinematography, the suspenseful battles between the witch hunters and the witches, and the twists and turns in the storylines and the characters. This was a more than impressive introduction which I hope we will soon be followed up by a sequel also starring Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Derak Mears, and their witch hunter in training Thomas Mann.A pleasantly under appreciated adventure/fantasy/action film worthy of a perfect 10 out of 10 rating!!!!!",10,9,9,1 April 2019
Duck You Sucker," A post Clint Eastwood trilogy from director Sergio Leone 'gone bad'
","Sometimes a film is made with the best intentions and with a very poor outcome. This is one of those films. It has a dreadful music score that is so irritating and goes like this 'sha shong...sha shong...sha shong...sha shong...' and it continues throughout the film. I just loved directors' Sergio Leone's earlier trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood and I believe Mr. Leone felt that if he used a catchy music score the same results would occur. Such was not the case.I also have great respect for Rod Steiger and James Coburn. But gentlemen please, why get involved with such dribble if not for a big pay cheque and a false belief that a Sergio Leone film has to be a five star film? The film is way too long with far too many scenes drawn out with close ups and that terrible, terrible, oh so terrible music score 'sha shong...sha shong...sha shong...sha shong'.I love a good western and I can even tolerate a slow western but this piece of Mr. Leone's body of work needed at least a 30-40 percent cut left on the editing floor. I give it a 3 out of 10, no less, no more 'sha shong...sha shong...sha shong...sha shong...sha shong...sha shong...ugh!'",3,15,27,22 August 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A great screenplay by an even greater Director in Quentin Tarantino....deserves Oscars galore
","This was a very interesting and engaging film with an expected yet still surprising ending even for a Quentin Tarantino standard. Mrs. Shullivan and I watched the film Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood after just seeing another Oscar contender 'Joker'. The Joker was a complete disappointment for us but Tarantino's latest and greatest film just kept getting better and better as each scene progressed until the film end credits rolled onto the screen. It IS fantastic from the beginning, right through to the end.The acting in Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood was superb, and the on screen relationship between the past his prime TV screen star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his long time stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) was thoroughly energetic and captivating. There was a top ten supporting cast throughout the film that even included Cliff Booth's gorgeous and well trained Pitbull dog named Brandy that surprisingly added great value to any of the scenes that included Cliff Booth and his Pitbull dog Brandy.It wasn't until Mrs. Shullivan and I had watched almost eighty (80) percent of the film that we realized how Tarantino had kept his record intact by surprising the hell out of us on how he ended his latest bona fide blockbuster film. Tarantino never seizes to do anything but weave a most intriguing story line by providing his audience with hints (if you are attentive enough) with many intriguing twists and turns to a thoroughly enjoyable film climax.No spoiler alert because the ending is so darn good that even Walt Disney couldn't have utilized Cliff Booth's dog Brandy any better in his starring role. We loved the whole movie but especially the ending. Wow!A perfect 10 out of 10 rating",10,14,20,26 January 2020
Django Unchained," One of the best westerns 'of all time' without a doubt! When will we see the sequel?
","Wow! You just can't beat watching a good Western, Action, Comedy, Thriller all wrapped up in to one great film for the history books. Then to top it all off why not have it directed by Quentin Tarantino and have your lead actor played by Jamie Foxx dressed to the nines in his nice blue velvet suit and frilly white scarf that reminds us of the renowned painting 'The Blue Boy' by the English painter/artist Thomas Gainsborough. Django Unchained will certainly go down in the history books of cinema as a true classic work of cinema art.The film was only nominated for five Academy Awards and ended up winning only two for Best Writing,Original Screenplay (Quentin Tarantino) and for Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Waltz). Personally I felt this film should have received several more nominations and won at least a few more Oscars. It is 'that good a movie' that I have added it to my library of Classic Films of all time.To those viewers who felt Tarantino went over the top, I say to you that Quentin is still relatively a young man and you have not seen anything yet. Tarantino plays a small role in this film and how he writes his own character out of the film is just pure genius and sure to be talked about for centuries by those avid film goers and masters of the creative arts.There is a very strong supporting cast with names such as Kerry Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson (he was better in Django Unchained than he was in Pulp Fiction if that is possible), James Remar, Walton Goggins, Don Johnson, M. C. Gainey, Michael Parks, and Ato Essandoh to name just a few of this brilliant cast of characters. I felt that all the actors put their heart and soul in to this film and it certainly was reflected on the big screen.One of my favorite scenes (and I had many favorite scenes) occurs relatively early in the film when the slave Django (played by none other than Jamie Foxx) accompanies a bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (played by Christopher Waltz) in to a towns local saloon to sit down and have a pint of cold beer. The slave Django is well aware and truly frightened to be sitting in a white mans saloon but at the coaxing of his rescuer Dr. King Schultz who promises Django an explanation shortly Django accepts the cold and refreshing beer while his curiosity about Dr. Schultz is getting the better of Django. What happens next is so bizarre that I would be spoiling the film for new viewers, but I will say it was simply a brilliant piece of screen writing. If you are a fan of Director Sergio Leone's and actor Clint Eastwood's 1960 spaghetti westerns trilogy than we the fans must demand that Quentin Tarantino and Jamie Foxx agree to sign on for two more sequels to Django Unchained and complete their own classic western trilogy as epic as A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly were to the 1960's. With Django Unchained they have a great start for a box office trilogy bonanza!",10,2,6,21 November 2013
Get Out," A curious and suspenseful film but with a less than stellar ending
","No doubt the lead actor Daniel Kaluuya who plays the African American boyfriend named Chris Washington was a stand out and well deserving of his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Chris who is going to meet his white girlfriend named Rose Armitage's (Allison Williams) parents at their home for the first time doesn't know what to expect on his first overnight stay and neither does the audience. This film bares little resemblance to the classic 1967 Comedy/Drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner starring Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Hepburn, which also has the African American boyfriend surprising his white girlfriend's parents over dinner at their home. The comparison ends there.Actor Daniel Kaluuya's facial expressions are priceless and I give him kudos for carrying this films quality performance more than the seasoned actors Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener who play Rose Armitage's parents. I also thought actor Lil Rel Howery who plays Rod Williams as Chris Washington's long distance best friend and advisor was the perfect opposite of the frantic Chris Washington. The screenplay reminded me a bit of the original 1975 The Stepford Wives in the vein of being brainwashed and under someone else's control.My only disappointment was the ending was a letdown compared to the other 90 percent of a very good screenplay. Overall I give the film a respectable 7 out of 10 rating and it is worth watching.",7,1,2,19 July 2018
Aladdin," This old man's thoughts
","Mrs. Shullivan and I are familiar with the earlier live and animated versions of Aladdin, but this version brings new life into the FAMILY ADVENTURE film which can be enjoyed in its purest form with all its spectacular color and escapism from your otherwise ho hum day.Will Smith is a wonderful, magical and wise genie. The lead role of Aladdin is played to perfection by the relative newcomer Mena Massoud. Aladdin's love interest and excited passenger on his magic carpet is Princess Jasmine played by the multi-talented Naomi Scott. Their singing duets were also enjoyable.This is definitely a family themed big adventure film, but it is also a classic DISNEY film that will definitely stand the test of time and when it is eventually released in the public domain, on whatever the current film format of the time may be, VHS, DVD, Blu Ray, 4K and/or 8K, I guarantee it will be enjoyed across the world in hundreds of different languages by young and old alike!I hope you can ignore all the bad reviews (I assume it's Disney's competition and/or disgruntled former Disney employees) and I bet a dime to a dollar the same people wrote bad reviews on earlier Disney released too! Walt Disney would be very proud that the 2019 version of Aladdin bears his name. A PERFECT 10 out of 10 rating!!!",10,16,38,26 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," Sorry Eddie, but I thought Keaton's and other nominees performance were more deserving for the Best Actor award
","I sometimes just don't get the Oscars voting procedure and periodically a winner is announced that I just sit there dumb founded and say What The? The Theory of Everything is a biography on the life and challenges of Stephen Hawking, the Theoretical Physicist who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's (ALS) disease and told he was not expected to live for any more than two years upon his diagnosis at age 21 in 1963. Eddie Redmayne is a good actor who this year walked away and won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance of Stephen Hawking but I really did not see how his performance was anything more than a cheaper imitation of John Hurt's performance in the Elephant Man. John Hurt did not win the 1981 Oscar that he was nominated for as the crippling and deformed figure of John Merrick.I understand the difficulty in crumpling up your body for a disease that gradually eats away at the central nervous system and still being able to live a full life. But watching Eddie crawl up a flight of stairs with his debilitating disease does not warrant beating out fellow Oscar nominees Keaton, Cumberbatch, Carell or even Cooper for that matter does it? This is not an enjoyable film, nor in my opinion did it capture the known historical events in Stephen Hawking's life (so far). But what I really don't understand is how Redmayne was honored with the Best Actor award for his performance over so many other superior performances by the other 2015 Oscar nominees. In my opinion the Oscar voters have lowered the bar much lower than it has ever gone in the past for warranting the Best Actor award.I have one question for the Oscar academy of voters. Did you actually see the other nominees performances? I give the film a 5 out of 10. As for the Best Actor award going to Eddie Redmayne for his performance? What The?",5,2,3,8 March 2015
Frozen," Families will treasure this Disney film classic
","Life is good when you get the opportunity to escape from reality for a few hours with this new animated Disney film classic that will surely appeal to all ages and the child within us all. This is a Hans Christian Andersen story that provides the viewer with an adventure in the snowy wilderness, young love, a beautiful musical score, and a humorous tale with a funny snowman named Olaf, and a pretty smart reindeer named Sven. The heart of the story surrounds two royal sisters named Anna and Elsa who were being raised by their parents the King and Queen in a kingdom named Arendelle until they encounter a series of unfortunate circumstances. The King and Queen are lost at sea during a terrible storm, and Elsa, the older sister discovers she possesses magical powers that allow her with a simple touch to turn everything in to ice and snow. Elsa almost kills her little sister Anna by the touch of her finger when she freezes the castle and then her kingdom and loses control of her magical powers. Fearing she may harm her little sister Anna again, Elsa decides to abandon her kingdom after being crowned the new Queen and instead heads up to the highest mountains to live alone in her self made ice castle where her magical powers are out of harms way.Young Anna cannot bare to be without her big sister Elsa so she departs from her kingdom of Arendelle and she heads up in to the woods for the adventure of a lifetime. Her adventure is not without danger though as she encounters a pack of wolves, a giant and angry snow man, and a group of singing trolls. Anna receives assistance on her journey from a young handsome woodsman named Kristoff, his reindeer named Sven and a cute and adorable snowman named Olaf. So on they go through the woods seeking out Anna's big sister Elsa to bring her home to the castle they both grew up in and played together in until that fatal accident that scared Elsa from playing with her little sister Anna, ever again.Frozen will keep you in your seat until the very end and we soon find out that true love can conquer all fears and all dangers. You may even find yourself holding back a few tears if you have any siblings that you shamelessly quarrelled with. I am not a fan of three (3D) dimensional feature films as I personally feel that the special effects actually take away from the magic of this wonderful Disney film. Call me old fashioned but the 3D effects I find more a distraction in Frozen. If I had been provided an option, I would have preferred to see the non 3D version. Having said that, I will however suggest that you get to the theater early so that you don't miss the very smartly done short cartoon that preceded Frozen. This Mickey Mouse short cartoon melds both an original 1930's black and white Mickey Mouse cartoon with a current 3D Mickey Mouse cartoon. The animators took the original 1930's Mickey Mouse cartoon and weaved in and out of the original black and white cartoon in to their 3D colorful characters during the chase scenes. It was quite a unique feat, but only when done in a short cartoon, not as effective in the feature film, Frozen.I rated Frozen a perfect 10 out of 10. You and all of your family will just love it. The musical score is also one of the most popular cinema musical scores produced of all time and is sung by young children all over the world.",10,6,9,17 February 2014
Room," Imagine yourself as a 5 year old child discovering for the first time a brand new world exists outside of your room
","SPOILER: At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film 'ROOM' won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. As Jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle and we the audience anticipate that Ma must try and escape with young Jack but how?The story draws similarities to the actual events that were Jaycee Lee Dugard's true life story which occurred on June 10, 1991, in South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in a make shift shed. There is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of Amanda Berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper Ariel Castro. This film was titled Cleveland Abduction and it was released in 2015. It tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over 10 years by Ariel Castro in his home with no one aware how close the girls were to their own homes and families.The film Room focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son. There are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever. Jack and Ma's is a story of isolation, fear, hopelessness versus hope and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. Room is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and best director. I give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating. This film is terrific!!",10,293,373,20 September 2015
Gran Torino," Clint is still a cowboy at heart and his Gran Torino is his 'hi-ho Silver'
","There may not be any native Californian Indians chasing Clint in this film but if this story line were played to the backdrop western theme score 'Tombstone' you would swear you were watching Clint playing the character Joe from his 1964 western For A Few Dollars More. Clint plays a grouchy old Polish descent Korean war vet named Walt Kowalski, who with each passing decade has seen his neighborhood gentrified which is difficult for an old war vet like Walt to adjust to being surrounded by the people he shot at decades ago when he was shipped overseas.When one of his next door neighbours teenage kid attempts to steal his priceless Gran Torino you think there would be hell to pay? Instead Walt Kowalski sees in this young man named Thao (played by Bee Vang) a lost soul who needs his help to stay on the right path and to stay as far away from the neighborhood criminal elements.We learn through time that as the old western saying goes....'Walt's bark is a lot worse than his bite.' Walt Kowalsky is a widower who is a foul mouthed (appears to be) racist old Korean war vet who happens to be estranged from his adult sons and his grandchildren so Walt develops an inner fondness for his foreign born neighbors and we see his heart shine through when trouble comes a calling in Walt Kowalsky's neighbourhood. Clint Eastwood directed himself in Gran Torino and he is more than prepared to share the limelight with his co-stars which is an admirable quality in the (then) 78 year old actor/director who is still going strong today ten (10) years later.We love you Clint, so don't go riding/driving out in to the sunset just yet. I believe you have a few more songs to sing before the sun goes down for the last time even at your current age of 88.I give Gran Torino an 8 out of 10 rating.",8,3,4,20 April 2018
Back to the Future Part III," And so Doc rides off into the sunset on his rocket train with his new family
","The Back to the Future trilogy is now complete and we have now seen time travel from the current 1985 back to 1955 then fast forward to 2015 and then slingshot back to the old cowpoke days of 1885 in Hill Valley. Don't despair though because that dastardly badman Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen / Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is back in the saddle to wreak havoc on not only the town of Hill Valley but to challenge quick draw Marty McFly to a draw.Marty travels back to 1885 to try and save his good friend Doc, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) after his name appears on a tombstone after drawing against Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. Good old Doc the scientist also finds a fellow book lover of H.G. Wells time travel in the pretty Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) and rather than have the romance aspect revolve around Marty McFly this time their are hearts a fluttering with Dr. Emmett Brown so the third time around is in fact a charm.It was a great way to end the trilogy and a western to boot!I give this third chapter a steady 9 out of 10 rating.",9,1,1,8 July 2019
Grudge Match," I demand a rematch! These fighters are worth seeing again!
","What a refreshing and unexpected (but nice) surprise Grudge Match was for the wife and I to sit down on a Saturday night, plop the Blu Ray disc in and for the next 2 hours, just enjoy a decent film minus any drugs, knife fights, or guns a blazing. When you have two major action stars such as Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone one might expect that the testosterone level on the big screen would get a bit heavy especially considering the movies theme is about two old and retired fighters who come out of retirement after 30 years to put the gloves back on and get back in to the ring to settle a very old score since both fighters won one of their two previous matches while in their prime back in the 1980's.Robert DeNiro plays Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen. Now Billy has a very big ego and since his boxing career ended prematurely 30 years ago he has done pretty good for himself owning his own car dealership and a successful bar called the Knockout. There is one scene in the film that I just grinned from ear to ear as Billy did a stand-up comedy routine in his bar with a puppet dressed as a prize fighter sitting in his corner as Billy bantered back and forth with the prize fighter dummy. The scene is less than a minute long but I give it full credit for the originality.Sylvester Stallone plays Henry 'Razor' Sharp. Now Razor was the guy who decided to hang up his gloves in the prime of his fighting career and we eventually find out why he retired. No spoiler alert, you will have to wait and hear it from Razor himself why he chose to retire from the ring. Razor's life has been kind of frozen in time these past 30 years, and he now works as a laborer in a factory, goes home to an empty house with no TV, cable or internet, and eats canned tuna and over ripened bananas to make ends meet. Razors life seems very depressing. Something is bothering him and the audience gets interested in finding out what makes Razor tick. I would have thought a boxing genre film would have been easier to figure out but the screenwriters did a good job in keeping the plot a bit deeper than most boxing films and we gradually grow to like Razor's character and think less of Billy the Kid's shallow and selfish personality.There is also a good supporting cast of characters such as Kevin Hart who plays fight promoter Dante Slate Jr.. Dante's deceased father used to promote Razor's fights and Razors' memories of Dante Slate Sr. are not very good as he recalls being ripped off of his prize fight earnings. So Razor instantly is not prepared to go back in to the ring with Dante Slate Jr. holding the purse strings. Eventually Dante convinces Razor to put the gloves back on, but only for a fight simulation video for a software video company who agrees to pay him $15K. The movie is worth watching if for nothing else but seeing Stallone and De Niro dressed up in their head to toe lime green leotards game gear costumes so the techies can video their fight simulation. Did I say fight simulation? Well once Billy and Razor are within ring distance of each other the brouhaha goes viral on the internet and 'the fight is on man!' We eventually get introduced to Kim Basinger's character Sally, who plays Razor's old love interest. Something happened to split Razor and Sally apart 30 years ago and we find out why Razor is a bit disenchanted with his life. When Razor eventually does agree to fight Billy for the grudge match of the decade he asks his old and trusted trainer Louis Lightning Conlon, played by veteran actor Alan Arkin. Louis is currently in a wheelchair and residing in an old age home, but Razor still wants his old and trusted friend Louis to get him back in to fighting shape. Razor is an honorable man and true friend as part of his income is used to pay for his friends nursing home costs. There are a couple of scenes that remind us in a fun way of Stallone's Rocky films that just add to the films humorous theme. Billy on the other hand goes through a few trainers including LL Cool J who plays Frankie Brite, and Billy eventually settles on having his long lost son BJ played smartly by Jon Bernthal to train him.Before you know it, we are witness to the fight of the decade in front of 18,000 fight fans split between who they want to win the fight. Most film goers always have their own prediction on who will win the main event. Will Razor win? Will Billy the Kid win? Or maybe it will be a draw? As I said no spoiler alert coming from me, so let's just say the ending is a good one. No, let me rephrase this..., I would say the ending is even better than I anticipated it would be. I Give Grudge match an 8 out of 10 ranking for the 10 rounds that Grudge Match went. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. It's a knockout hit.",8,14,17,29 November 2014
The Imitation Game," One of THE VERY BEST films of the past decade
","Most people go to a movie hoping to see what 'they anticipate or expect' based on a published story line (example as posted on IMDb or a local newspaper) and the posted movie genre of their preference that being an action, drama, thriller, romance, comedy or other. Mrs. Shullivan and I use Friday nights as our date night, dinner and a movie. Our deal is that we alternate who gets to pick the film we are going to see. On this particular Friday night it was my turn to pick our film elixir so I chose the autobiography (slash) thriller, The Imitation Game, and what a fine elixir it was for both of us! For all the mediocre and truly bad movies we sit through, when you eventually discover a gem like The Imitation Game the movie drug hits you once again and you realize that yes, it is still worth putting on your coat, stepping out in to the cold night and putting down your hard earned cash to go to the theatre rather than wait to purchase a DVD copy for half the price a feature film, popcorn and drinks will cost you. The Imitation Game is the type of film that quite simply just keeps you intensely focused on that large screen and allows one to escape anything and everything that is happening around you as if you were sitting in an empty theatre and the film is playing to an audience of one.you.Obviously this autobiography has taken liberties with Alan Turing's actual events. To create a truly memorable film the relatively unknown screenwriter (Graham Moore) and director (Morten Tyldum) would need to utilize the 114 minutes film length to reflect not only actual events that take place over decades from mathematician's Alan Turing's academic years as an introverted and closeted homosexual but also as a mathematical genius, problem solver whose interactions with fellow classmates, military personnel and fellow code breakers would keep Alan Turing as an outcast always looking in. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing with so much emotion and intensity that we the audience all were rooting for him to break the German's secretive code. When he eventually does break the code with his machine named (after his only friend from his school days) Christopher, Turing shows us how valuable he was to the British intelligence by realizing how effective mathematical probabilities really are in winning not the battle, but the war.This film depicts an unknown likely hero who through his efforts in building one of the very first computers saved hundreds, thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of peoples' lives with the assistance of Alan Turing's genius. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance has been rewarded with both a nomination for an Academy Award and Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor of January 2015. Whether he wins or loses these awards Mrs. Shullivan and I reward him with our gratitude for keeping our interest to continue to support the theatre box office.There are some other excellent performances as well such as by Keira Knightley who plays the only female code breaker Joan Clarke and true friend of Alan Turing, Matthew Goode who plays Hugh Alexander originally assigned as the Team Leader of the code breakers but is eventually ousted by British Intelligence in favor of Alan Turing, the quirky smart-ass unlikeable code breaker but persistent to no end in breaking the German code. Mark Strong who played Major General Chief of British Secret Intelligence Service M16 also played a very convincing role.The Imitation Game does not waste one minute of screen time. This film embodies a superb story line, wonderful cinematography, true wit when needed, and a stellar cast of actors that will be remembered for decades by their performance in The Imitation Game. As I stated at the beginning of my movie appraisal, this week was my turn to choose and the last film we saw was Mrs. Shullivan's choice and she chose a musical genre that was simply a stinker of a film. To break the mystery of Mrs. Shullivan's last (lousy) movie pick you will have to go back to my previous review under the genre 'musical'. Good luck if you choose to take the challenge and break the code.",9,4,10,27 January 2015
Here Comes the Boom," A Disney clone with a lot more punch and non stop humour
","Wow, what a nice surprise this film was. Instead of watching another boring TV rerun, we decided to pop in the Blu Ray version of Here Comes the Boom and the missus and I ended up pleasantly surprised at just how good this movie was. The film stars the trimmed down King of Queens TV Star, Kevin James, as a despondent high school Biology teacher named Scott Voss with 10 years of service behind him. I am going to assume that Kevin James spent a considerable amount of time training in a gym to get down to the weight he did and to reduce so much of his body fat in preparation for the amount of time he would spend in the Octagon during the many fight sequences that appeared in the film. A special note for parents of young children, the violence is limited to a few 'biff, boom, bangs' sort of in the realm you would witness in the World Wrestling on television, so not to worry, I would allow a child to watch this film. Supporting Kevin James is actress Salma Hayek who plays Bella Flores, the school nurse, as Scott Voss's tough to win over love interest. Scott's continued and failed pursuit of Bella makes everyone want him to win her over at some time, somehow. The 'somehow' comes in to play when the mean school principal, Principal Betcher, played by Greg Germann who is probably best known for his womanizing role in the 1997 TV series Ally McBeal, announces he has to cut from the school budget the entire music program. This is why I felt Here Comes the Boom has that Disney style look and feel theme, but with a lot more 'oomph' to appeal to a mature audience. The film contains a romantic theme, with some great music similar to GLEE productions dispersed throughout the film, an underdog hero, namely despondent Biology school teacher Scott Voss, who uncharacteristically steps up in defense of the music teacher who is about to lose his job. The music teacher, Marty Streb, played to perfection by Henry Winkler, adds some comic relief as the victim in the film and he agrees to support Scott Voss as his corner man in the Octagon. Scott announces that he will attempt to raise the $48,000.00 needed to save the music program, and Marty Streb's job. Unfortunately for Scott he does not have a game plan as to how he will actually raise the needed funding to save the school's music program, and more importantly, Marty Streb's job. Scott then realizes that the lovely Bella is impressed with his willingness to TRY, so Scott figures out with the assistance of one of his night school students, a retired mixed martial experts fighter named Niko, played exceptionally well by former MMA fighter Bas Rutten, that he could possibly WIN the money through MMA prize fights just by losing a bunch of fights in the Octagon. Again, in true Disney style, (although this is not a Disney production), the comedy that ensues is priceless. I must say I did a lot of belly laughing throughout the film. There are far too many good and truly funny scenes in this film, to point out. I gave it an 8 out of 10 rating, and I would be very surprised if Kevin James does not make a sequel with the same cast. This is well worth a watch for all ages.",8,1,2,11 February 2014
La La Land," ooo-lah-lah !!!
","Friday is date night and tonight it was my turn to pick the picture. To Mrs. Shullivan's surprise I picked the musical La La Land. Normally I would have picked a comedy or a good thriller, but we both wanted to see why there were so many mixed reactions to this feature film. It seemed to be a 50/50 split between loved it and hated it. With us two Shullivan's we were not on the fence, we both loved it.Okay so neither star Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone can sing or dance very well but that was some of the charm emanating from La La Land and this will certainly be a memorable romantic/musical film for decades to come. I don't rely on determining the quality of a film based on how many Academy award nominations and/or wins a film may be awarded because as far as the awards shows go most are just for the pompous farts who produce their own films and they do not like to share significant awards at all. Thus we never see any comedies or action/thrillers even receiving award nominations, just some really big box office revenues. So who needs awards shows when you have everyday critics like IMDb viewers who provide realistic feedback, sometimes good, sometimes bad.What Mrs. Shullivan and I liked most was the latter half of the film as jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and wannabe actress Mia (Emma Stone) resolved their personal issues with each other and they bonded as live-in partners in support of each others dreams. Of course in any relationship there are highs and lows and Sebastian and Mia certainly had their share of ups and let downs. We loved the bright rich diverse colors of all the actors and dancers costumes as well as the rich hue of the Hollywood California landscapes that writer/director Damien Chazelle integrated into many of the song and dance numbers. The cinematography was brilliant during the song and dance numbers performed by all of the cast, especially Ryan and Emma's significant song and dance number that is displayed as the film's cover art. This scene takes place just after Sebastian and Mia leave a party together as they first get to know each other a little bit better than just as acquaintances'. As I said maybe Ryan and Emma are not classically trained singers/dancers but how many of us normal couples fell in love while listening to great music and shaking the old hips 'ala one, two three? Isn't that what makes romance such a magical experience.I do not want to give away the ending but I will say that this musical has some unexpected twists and turns that in my humble opinion make this what will be considered a classic musical/romance in the following decades that hopeless romantics (like Mrs Shullivan and I) will want to see a couple of times in their lifetime, maybe even with their teenage grandchildren who will also fall in love with La La Land for many generations to come.This film covers Sebastian and Mia's relationship as it evolves over all four seasons and then some with new musical numbers that include songs by the world class musician John Legend, some old style 1950's big dance numbers with vibrant costumes and reminiscent of Martha and the Vandellas who would in 1983 sing 'they would be dancing in the streets', literally. There is no mixed feelings about this film for Mrs. Shullivan and I, we don't care how many Academy awards La La Land wins or loses. All you really need to know is that we loved the film, yes it will eventually be rated as a classic musical/romance film and yes I am giving it a five star rating, a perfect 10 for 10 score. We simply just loved it, from the beginning and especially through to the ending.",10,3,9,3 February 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Walt would be 'OH' so very proud of this live version...so where is all this hate coming from?
","As any parent should be proud of their children so is father Maurice (Kevin Kline) of his only child, his daughter Belle (Emma Watson) who could never imagine herself swooning over the town's handsome and one-dimensional Ox named Gaston who was played by Luke Evans quite well. Gaston is really in love with himself and he realizes if he wants to have little Gaston's to continue bearing his name then he wants to marry the smartest, prettiest and the only woman in the town who he just cannot convince to marry him, and that young lady happens to be Belle.I am not a big fan of musicals and as an example I was most displeased to have to sit through the 2014 Disney live version of Into the Woods. Once Emma Watson commenced singing her opening song Ms. Shullivan grabbed my arm just a little bit tighter and I just knew this was going to be another Disney classic...and it is!There are so many first class performers in this film such as Ewan McGregor who plays Luminere the candelabra, Ian McKellan who plays Cogsworth the mantle clock, the classy Emma Thompson who is no stranger to appearing in Disney films so she plays Mrs. Potts and by default Belle's conscience while she resides in the Beast's castle. Other great performances were on display by Audra McDonald who plays Madame Garderobe, and I cannot forget Stanley Tucci who plays Maestro Cadenza and of course Gaston's flunky sidekick the gay LeFou played perfectly by Josh Gad.Some countries apparently are uncomfortable with LeFou being a bit more interested in Gaston than he should be but let's face it, this is the year 2017, and so any film should embrace actors/actresses that reflect today's society. In fact if I would have been asked for my opinion by the producers for any suggestions, without hesitation although I truly believe the six (6) foot Luke Evans performance as Gaston was excellent, I would have suggested an alternate name to play Gaston. Or at least give the six (6) foot four (4) inch retired NFL Hall of Fame defensive end, the gap tooth super handsome Michael Strahan to be provided an opportunity to test for the role of Gaston. Strahan would have been great and he would also have allowed a new generation of young children to see that Disney films have evolved to be inclusive when selecting starring roles.Okay so for those naysayers who want to compare this version of Beauty and the Beast to earlier versions, and compare actual Disney characters, or actors/actresses, or the songs style and/or the singers who sing them, I suggest you just close your eyes and please just try to imagine yourself as a very younger version of your own self. If you do this and then fast forward to your adult self you will wake up to see that we are in the year 2017, and that good producers attempt to be more inclusive if the story allows for it and in most cases Disney films such as this great Disney Classic, Beauty and the Beast does. So I loved seeing the diversity in the ballroom scene, I loved Emma Watson and Luke Wilson's gradual affection for each other, I loved Josh Gad's closing scene where he finds his mate, and although I am still not convinced that CGI is an essential part, or for that matter 3-D film versions when I see the younger crowd mesmerized by this film, then I can accept it...and maybe some of you naysayers should be a bit more open minded.I know this live version of Beauty and the Beast will do extremely well at both the box office and when it is eventually released in the retail stores on DVD/Blu Ray format, or streaming one day on NetFlix, or some other new format, such as when humans eventually live on another planet. Walt Disney himself had this kind of endless imagination where others did not and I just know he would have been very proud of all the performances of this cast, the cinematography and of course the musical score.FOOTNOTE: Mrs. Shullivan and I did like the 1991 animated version, but we are in agreement on this next point...we enjoyed this 2017 live version a lot more!!!I rate this Disney Classic a perfect 10 out of 10. It is definitely a keeper.",10,19,42,17 March 2017
Jack Reacher," Tom 'Snooooooooze' is just not believable as a war veteran
","I tried. I mean I really tried. I just could not keep this picture even remotely believable in my mind with the 5 foot 7 inch Tom 'Snooze' as the most dangerous hand to hand combat, martial arts expert, as well as a pot shot sharp shooter sniper. Please give me a break.Then to top it off we witness Tom willing to take on 5 guys in front of the bar he was sitting in a few minutes earlier when he called this young girl 'a skank'. You would not believe it. You hear legs and arms cracking, and the skanky girl stands there shocked into silence as the 5 men who came to defend her honor over Tom's skank remark.I tell you what was skanky. Almost all of the action scenes that the so called (short stature) action hero, good old boy Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) was in. The plot was thin, and the schlock was thick. Tom was leaving an unbelievable (and I mean that it was unbelievable) trail of chaos and death behind him, as easy as I can slice through butter. I almost fell asleep around the 30 minute mark. I give Jack Reacher a 4 out of 10 rating, and even that is being generous.",4,4,5,13 September 2017
The Shape of Water," 🍷 🍕 Sunday, March 4, 2018...and the Best Picture goes to The Shape of Water!
","Are you a movie fanatic?Are you a movie lover?Are you a hopeless romantic?Are you a dreamer?Do you enjoy films that clearly define good versus evil?Do you wish to inspire our youth to do great things?The Shape of Water is the fulfillment of all these inspirational beliefs. The scenery brings us back to a past time in our lives when life was simpler and hidden secrets were in abundance. The screenplay was written by Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor. Their screenplay is both creative and at the same time haunting. The cast was perfectly matched. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito a mute cleaning lady whose partner at work is none other than 2012 Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer who plays cleaning lady Zelda Fuller. These two ladies clean all day mopping up urine from the men's bathroom floor at a government run top secret facility in Baltimore. After work, they go home where Zelda cooks and cleans for her lazy no good husband, and Elisa spends her evenings alone in her bathtub pleasuring herself to the beat of an egg timer.Then in walks Richard Strickland (played menacingly and true to form by Michael Shannon) with his 3 foot electric prodding cane, and a water contraption that contains some type of amphibious creature that can swim and live in both salt water and stand upright on dry land. Richard Strickland brings this strange beast to the Baltimore facility for scientists such as actor Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Doctor Robert Hoffstetler can study and examine the beast.One very interesting character that I cannot fail to mention is actor Richard Jenkins who plays Giles, Elisa's co-tenant who both live upstairs from the local Orpheum theater. Giles character is lonely, he is a gay man, a commercial artist with great talent, but apparently without a bright future due to some previous drinking problem. Giles friendship with the mute Elisa is sincere and loving as they both are two lonely individuals looking for something more from life. Richard Jenkins character Giles, has some of the best one-liners I have heard in a long time. One such one liner was 'don't play with the cats'. You will have to see this wonderful film to appreciate Giles hilarious and timely comments.When Elisa has an opportunity to meet the amphibious creature while cleaning the facility she immediately forms a bond with the creature. They communicate by hand gestures and by heart felt facial expressions which eventually lead to a romantic relationship. Michael Shannon's role as Richard Strickland is a take no prisoners type of character and he plays a despised overseer of the creature who punishes the creature at will and for his own pleasure. Elisa realizes that if she does not react quickly to free the creature from his captivity he will surely die at the insistence and obstinate hand of Richard Strickland. So we the audience are kept in suspense on how will the meek and mild mute cleaning lady Elisa who has affection for the creature successfully save the creature?I felt the escape plan was executed with great suspense and curiosity and contained some of the best scenes by writer/director Guillermo del Toro's vision that I would be surprised if this film does not win at least six (6) Academy Awards on Sunday March 04th, 2018, Oscar night.Mrs Shullivan and I loved the film, and we were fortunate to be able to see the film with son number 2 and his set dresser girlfriend who contributed in making many of the films scenes so beautifully crafted and matched to both the musical score and the characters constant interactions that also happened to keep a full house of movie lovers in awe of your next Best Picture for 2018 winner.A perfect 10 for 10 score!",10,21,38,10 December 2017
Joker," A total letdown ... a hybrid film bordering between Taxi Driver and the Purge film trilogy
",Ugghhh how could I be so wrong in my assessment of Joker when the majority of film goers and film reviewers have rated this abhorrent film an average of 8.6 on IMDB? What have I missed seeing? How can over 600 thousand film goers have liked this film and the film receive 11 Oscar nominations when both Mrs. Shullivan and I just hated it and considered it as much a waste of time as we did with the 1977 acclaimed film Eraserhead?Joaquin Phoenix being nominated for a best actor Oscar? You have got to be kidding me? Maybe he should have been awarded a medal from Weight Watchers for shedding 52 pounds for his pathetic role as the brooding and mentally disturbed Arthur Fleck aka Joker. But an Oscar nomination?We chose to next watch the 2019 film Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood which was nominated for ten (10) Oscars this year and it is competing with Joker's eleven (11) nominations. I will be shocked if Joker wins any Oscars and even more shocked and disappointed if Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood does not win against Joker in any of their competing categories.Let's see if my rating of 3/10 holds true on Oscar night and if Joker gets shut out as I would anticipate it would.,3,7,16,26 January 2020
Man on Fire," Pip squeak Lupita wins over the heart of her personal bodyguard and cold blooded killer John W. Creasy
","Okay, so it took me a third watch of Man On Fire to finally get around to writing a review only because to be quite honest, I was tired of seeing Denzel Washington in another action/crime film. But now that the film is well past its freshness date (16 years from its original release date) and after just watching it again for the third time, I saw something magical in the on screen chemistry between a very young ten (10) year old Dakota Fanning and the super star and box office magician, Denzel Washington.Maybe the plot is a bit stereo typed and ridiculous, (child kidnapping in Mexico and corrupt police force) and Dakota's parents (Radha Mitchell and Marc Anthony) are more than just shallow parents, but what holds this film well above its peers in the crime/hero genre is the growing affection that hired ex CIA operative John Creasy (Denzel Washington) develops for his protective nine (9) year old child Lupita Ramos (Dakota Fanning). Initially we the audience see the relationship between Pita (as she is called) and Creasy Bear (as he is affectionately called by little Lupita) as nothing more as a paid gig that neither child or protector are too keen on, but each day little pip squeak Lupita wears down the hard drinking emotionless bodyguard John Creasy and when she is kidnapped by a slew of bad Mexican banditos, Creasy swears he will make sure anyone and everyone who played even a tiny part in his clients abduction will pay for it with their lives.The director Tony Scott spared no expense in making sure John Creasy's vengeance mission to make the criminals pay for their bad choice in abductions left no stone unturned, no vehicle explosion too powerful, and no interrogation too brutal that the film had to be rated for adult only audiences.This is the third time I have seen the film and I am sure to want to watch it again over the next few decades as it surely is a film classic in the crime/hero genre. I give the film a decent 7 out of 10 IMDB rating.",7,2,2,28 May 2020
American Gangster," Like trying to squeeze five (5) pounds of beautiful fresh tomatoes into a tiny ten (10) ounce can
","A lengthier (2 hrs & 37 min) than normal crime based film that tried to encapsulate more than could easily be described on the large screen. The cinematography and music score were excellent and the actors were also top notch. But this film was like trying to squeeze two pounds of fresh tomatoes into a ten (10) ounce can, it got messy with a lot of true life crime and good story line laying on the cutting room floor.Superior actors such as Denzel Washington who played the real life shrewd and nasty drug lord Frank Lucas who maintained a cocaine drug stronghold during the late 1960's and early 1970's and the (then) honest detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) who eventually arrested Lucas and took away all of his wealth through the court of law were played masterfully.I was merely disappointed in how the producers attempted to package so much criminal historical value into a mere 157 minutes of screen time. The story line would have been much better served if produced as a ten (10) part TV mini series. I give this film version of the life and times of real life drug lord Frank Lucas a decent enough IMDB rating of 7 out of 10.",7,2,4,28 May 2020

","For those non-believers, naysayers and pessimists let me begin by unequivocally stating that the film The Blind Side is not a Christian based funded film, and the real Michael Oher's life has been embellished and timelines changed somewhat for the big screen. What cannot be disputed though is the fact that the Tuohy family most likely saved Michael Oher from being an impoverished youth with no bright future. Instead the Tuohy's who had the financial ability, but more importantly the willingness to bring a complete impoverished stranger into their home and blend in with their two existing children as a family unit.No doubt The Blind Side is an inspirational story that will tug at your heart strings, and you may even shed a few tears as Mrs. Shullivan and I both succumbed to, not once, but twice. Even the second time as we sat down to watch the film several years later after it was originally released. The portrayal by actor Quinton Aaron of the desperate and abandoned young Michael Oher is very real such that you wish you could help this young man yourself. Michael's relationship with the four (4) Tuohy family members especially the mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock was a relationship that exuded generosity, compassion and understanding. Sandra Bullock went on to win her first Oscar for her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy and I would agree with the Academy members who voted for her. I also felt that Quinto Aaron was deserving of an Oscar nomination as his role was just as difficult and effective in generating empathy for the under privileged youth and how a persons life can be turned around if only given an opportunity to succeed within a decent environment and with a families support.The Blind Side will stand the test of time and may even inspire a few more families to open their hearts and their homes to a stranger who may need a helping hand. I give the film a high 9 out of 10 rating, and maybe by the third time I watch it again my rating may increase to a perfect 10.",9,1,1,1 April 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The cinematography is luscious with a very creative screenplay and mesmerizing musical score
","I left the theater feeling I got my moneys' worth, and as a result I have placed this film title on my 'purchase for personal library' list. Why? Well I am not a big fan of dark comedies but the characters in this film, and more importantly the actors playing the characters were all top notch performances. I can understand why Michael Keaton would have received an Academy Award nomination for Lead Actor, and why he has already won the 2015 Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.The film revolves around a depressed washed up action hero whose action hero character the Birdman made three epic multi-million blockbuster films some two decades earlier. After losing his box office drawing power Riggan Thomas (played by Michael Keaton) decides to invest his remaining bankroll and mortgage his Malibu beach home to write, direct and act in a Broadway play based on a short story written by an author named Raymond Carver. Carver had hand written a note and personally handed it to Riggan complementing him on his performance when Riggan was a young actor just starting out in the business. Riggan held on to that note for the next three decades in his wallet as a reminder that someone as famous as Raymond Carver believed in his acting abilities. So Riggan decides to muster up all his courage, talent (and especially his own money) to adapt his stage play based on Raymond Carver's short story that was written some 50 years earlier. Riggan will give his heart, soul and mind to direct and also act in his stage play.Riggan's action hero character Birdman continues to haunt and taunt Riggan's mind by telling him he is the Birdman and must rise up and fly like he has never flown before and take the worlds evil doers on as he did when he was the number one rated box office draw. Riggan realizes that his mind is playing tricks on him and so he tries to suppress these images of the Birdman when it appears in his dressing room just before he is to appear on stage.The stage is where we get to see both Michael Keaton's and Edward Norton's brilliance as 'A grade' actors. Norton adds both humor and suspense to the film when he joins the plays cast as a late replacement for an actor that Riggan felt was just awful for his play. So Norton, who plays Mike, is considered a natural born for the stage box office draw agrees to join the cast after his live in girlfriend Lesley (played by Naomi Watts) recommends her boyfriend Mike to Riggan.The business of operating the play is managed by a lawyer named Jake (played superbly by Zach Galifianakis). Jake also adds some of the the comedy relief to the depressing character of Michal Keaton's Riggan/Birdman. Jake is Riggan's oldest and dearest best friend and moral compass to keep the stage play financially afloat but Riggan's mind continues to waver as Birdman's character continues to make his presence felt in Riggan's mind and he continues to explode and make some bad decisions with both his finances and his career.Adding to his personal turmoil is his ex-wife Sylvia (played by Amy Ryan) and his daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone) fresh out of re- hab who are both hovering around the stage and adding to his guilt of not being a faithful husband or present father.So we the audience get to see if Riggan can survive his own stage play, his family guilt, his girlfriend, his new and brilliant co-star Mike, a New York stage critic with a nasty pen that has buried many a Broadway plays on their opening night, and of course can Riggan survive Birdman? I did enjoy this 2 hour dark dramedy more than I thought I would mainly due to the strong acting by this cast of stars and I will give credit to the director Alejandro González Iñárritu for maintaining a strong story line and captivating his audience. Mrs. Shullivan came out of the theatre stating 'well that was different but I did enjoy Michael Keaton and Edward Norton's performances'. It will be added as a keeper to my collection. Well done. I give the film an 8 out of 10.",10,7,17,17 January 2015
Wonder Woman," I enjoyed the cinematography, story line and of course Gail Gadot as Wonder Woman
","I think the producers are at least 28 years late in finally introducing a female lead as their heroine who would be capable of carrying a huge blockbuster action/adventure film by herself. No disrespect to male co star Chris Pine who plays Steve Trevor who himself is trying to save the world from destruction by the Germans, but Gal Gadot kicks butt and brings to her audience a believable female action heroine who certainly shows by her actions that she does not need a man by her side to save her in distress.I really enjoyed the cinematography, as well as the musical score which had great synchronization with the non stop action displayed on the screen. The colour throughout the film was dynamic and crisp and I would put my money down that if Gal Gadot had not been just four (4) years old when Michael Keaton was first presented on the big screen as the Batman back in 1989, we would have in fact had a female action heroine winning over Batman at the box office back in 1989.Congratulations to the women's movement and to all those pre-teens who will try and emulate Diana the Wonder Woman as they grow into adulthood. The day will come maybe in my lifetime when the next Mixed Martial Arts Champion such as Conor McGregor or boxing champion such as Floyd Mayweather when asked who their idol was growing up and their response is Wonder Woman. There will come a time when women will become equal to men in almost every way, including as heroes to emulate, and boys will emulate strong film characters as Wonder Woman. The proof will come when women get paid equal or better than men in Hollywood based on their box office draw and not by their sex.I am a proud man and I congratulate Wonder Woman for the strong message it sends to all its audience. My only dislike was there was a bit too much CGI (Computer-generated imagery) during some of the extended action scenes which should have been edited down. Sometimes too much...is simply too much (CGI). I give the film a sound 7 out of 10 rating.",7,9,19,23 September 2017
Back to the Future Part II," You got me going in circles
","Whose on first? There's McFly's in the future and lots of dopplegangers in the past (1955 & 1985). Some reviewers said there was too much of Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) both the old Biff guy and the young tough Biff guy but I liked the conflict that this sequel created with the tug of war(s) between the old and current Biff's and Marty McFly's. I was disappointed that Crispin Glover did not reprise his role as Marty McFly's feeble father George McFly but the writers were able to work him out of this film sequel admirably. (I understand Crispin Glover had sued Zemeckis for the illicit use of his image via a mask and he won his lawsuit?)At more than one point I will admit I lost track if Marty and Doc were in 1955 or in 1985 and which Marty McFly was real or travelling back to the future. Although the storyline was not as intriguing as the original it was more than enjoyable to want Mrs. Shullivan and I to proceed further and immediately plop in disc 3 and watch the finale film Back to the Future 3.I mean, who isn't curious what the future has in store for yourself eh?I rated this sequel an excellent 9 out of 10 rating.",9,2,4,8 July 2019
Black Panther," We watched it at home...no interruptions...I fell asleep after the second major fight
","Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. 'ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em'.Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my 'repeat' list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners.",6,3,5,23 February 2019
The Greatest Showman," Made for movie lovers of all ages. Word of mouth of the films inspirational value will surely spread
","What a wonderful, wonderful film to just escape from this hectic world's problems for approximately two (2) hours and enjoy a great cast from the beginning to the very end ...even the credits. Mrs. Shullivan and I wanted to stay and watch Hugh Jackman, The Greatest Showman a second time but unfortunately we were attending the last showing for the day's film performance.We especially enjoyed the song and amazingly inspirational choreographed dance of the entire cast in the title song 'This Is Me'. Truly, truly this was inspirational. Michelle Williams, Zendaya, Zac Efron, of course you cannot take your eyes off of Hugh Jackman who is so talented, and the entire cast provided great family entertainment. Forget the multitude of CGI on steroids films produced by Marvel Studios and sit back and watch just a truly entertaining film with a biopic of the great PT Barnum unfold to a superb soundtrack and some inspirational dance numbers burst on to the big screen in such brilliant colors right before your very eyes.I will definitely be purchasing a special edition Blu Ray when it becomes available to add to my collection of All-Time Film Classics.",10,1,3,25 February 2018
Ben-Hur," In the top 100 films for the century
","I must have watched Ben-Hur several times (or more) in the past 60 years and I never get tired of seeing this classic eleven (11) time Academy Award winning feature adventure/historic film. In my entire lifetime I always refer back in the old memory bank to that epic chariot race between Charlton Heston and his old friend and now new nemesis Stephen Boyd. What a classic piece of film history this scene still is more than 60 years later.There is no comparison to the 2006 film CGI generated action film titled '300'.
They don't make movies like Ben-Hur anymore. Too bad they don't. No wonder why the film industry today is becoming a dying avenue for our entertainment value.A deserving 9 out of 10 IMDB rating.",9,1,1,15 April 2020
Green Book," Entertaining and reminiscent of the 1960's that I remember, sadly it was also a time for much bias
","A perfect 10 for 10 ratingViggo Mortensen, and Mahershala Ali were destined to play the characters of the tough and gruff Italian night club bouncer Tony Lip, and the sophisticated African American classic pianist Dr. Donald Shirley respectively. Some road trip movies can drag on and on and leave their audiences minds' wandering as the constant babbling by the main characters over incidentals drags on. But this was not the case with this 'road trip' film which in my humble opinion was deserving of the five (5) Academy Award nominations that this film received, and definitely deserving of the three (3) wins for Best Picture, Best Supporting actor (Mahershala Ali), and best original screenplay.Mrs. Shullivan and I did see Bohemian Rhapsody and I believe that Viggo Mortensen was robbed of the best actor award over Rami Malek's ho hum performance as Freddy Mercury. Maybe Bohemian Rhapsody should have won for best make up and hairstyling. Malek's fake portruding front teeth were over empha'sized' and over exaggerated, and maybe the voters were paying more attention to the visuals rather than the content of the performances because Viggo nailed his performance as the tough Bronx chauffeur who loved food as much as he loved talking (thus the monogram Tony Lip) and living life.Green Book refers to today's version of an on line travel log, but back in the 1960's the real Green Book identified which Hotels/Motels would accept African Americans in the deep south for an over night stay and where they could eat their meals. The picture reflects the disparity between whites and blacks in the 1960's and we see how Tony Lip gradually becomes close friends with his black, gay, and sophisticated boss, Dr. Donald Shirley. There are some really sensitive yet touching and emotional scenes that are surely to become film classics. No spoilers, you need to watch the film and suck in all the great acting, music, and cinematography on your own.Mrs. Shullivan and I agreed that this film was definitely worthy of the Best Picture award and I hope to see this duo of Viggo Mortensen, and Mahershala Ali star in future films together as their portrayals were so natural that they fit together like the right and left shoes even with each foot having some different characteristics and flaws, they walked and talked as if they were one and the same.We were not bored at all through this road trip film and the only sad part was when the film was prompted with that subtle but effective 'THE END'. Fortunately I bought a copy so Mrs. Shullivan and I can watch it again and again.A perfect 10 for 10 rating",10,1,3,21 August 2019
Back to the Future," Forget about your own troubles for awhile and enjoy this family/adventure/sci-fi classic
","I have watched this 1985 film classic Back to the Future several times now and I have never grown tired of it. Not only does it stand the test of time (no pun intended) but this family adventure just keeps getting better and better, My three sons grew up watching it with me and in the next few years into the future our first grandson will also be old enough to enjoy this treasure trove of a film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make every minute 'a must see' with the worlds destiny imminently at stake. Added to the quality of the cast are Marty McFly's parents played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover, and I just loved the films' buffed bully Biff Tannen played to perfection by Thomas F. Wilson,This is certainly one of the top 100 films of the second half of the twentieth century in film making and an all time film classic to ensure Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's legacy as bona fide film stars.A perfect 10 out of 10 rating!!!!!",10,1,1,8 July 2019
Draft Day," Reminded me a lot of 1996's Jerry Maguire
","Oh well, this film is nothing special to rave about, but it is a good time waster and although an obvious aging Kevin Costner (62) who like many aging actors choose to color their hair in an unrealistic vanity color has an unrealistic sexual relationship with the much younger Jennifer Garner (44). I guess that was one way the producers were able to secure Costner in the lead role playing Sonny Weaver Jr., the GM for NFL's perennial losers the Cleveland Browns. Ms. Garner plays the teams financial guru Ali, who besides keeping the Browns books straight, Ali has also been keeping Sonny straight to the point that she is carrying his baby. As I said earlier this must have been another vanity project for Kostner as the stud GM porking the much younger and hotter bean counter Ali. I would have found the story line much more interesting and a lot less jaundiced if Kostner's love interest was someone more around his own age, someone like Michelle Pfeiffer, Jamie Lee Curtis or maybe Kim Basinger. I know this is just a sports film but if I am going to watch a film I want to at least feel as if the story line is somewhat realistic.Okay so now that Kostner's irritating vanity has been addressed I could not help but be reminded of the player/agent Jerry Maguire in the film of the same name (Jerry Maguire-1996) played by Tom (snooze) Cruise who stuck by his injured wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and so I quickly drew the comparison between Rod Tidwell and that of actor Chadwick Boseman as a college linebacker Vontae Mack. Boseman played his role to perfection not trying to be a scene stealer from the star Kostner but I must say my attention was on Boseman's performance more than anyone else's.It is also difficult for me to believe that competing GM's could actually pull off the scenario on draft day that Cleveland Brown's GM Sonny Weaver Jr. pulled off in this film. I don't want to have to add this as a spoiler but I will end my review with a common statement made by many sportscasters including that made by ESPN's sportscaster Chris Berman who opened up the film and what he should have said was 'Come on Man!!!!'",6,2,3,22 January 2017
