Scarface," A TRUE GANGSTER EPIC
","What a fantastic movie this is,this genre is truly mastered here with an out of the box performance from AL PACINO,ultra violent & ruthless with a hint of sanity lingering deep inside a semi psychotic mind,a thrill ride from zero to kingpin taking you from political murder to cartel drug runner.some critics have this down as cheesy & poorly acted but the truth is this is still probably the best gangster film ever made.if like me you are a fan of this genre and appreciated films like CARLITOS WAY,GOODFELLAS,THE GODFATHER ETC.then this film will not disappoint.",10,5,5,3 January 2020
Alien 3," PRISONER CELL BLOCK SPACE
","The third installment of the ALIEN franchise takes a different direction here,again RIPLEY is floating through space for god knows how long and this time she lands on a maximum security space prison.RIPLEY is again the only survivor of previous events and she is the only common denominator in all 3 movies although BISHOP does get a cameo here,soon it becomes obvious that RIPLEY is the only female among a male population of murderers,rapists and violent criminals and the obvious danger sets in,RIPLEY takes drastic action in an attempt to blend and makes an alliance from an unlikely source,now a cat goes missing and yes the XENOMORPH is back,it has traveled with RIPLEY most likely in the corpse of NEWT who did not survive the journey.soon all the hard case criminals realize the magnitude of the threat and they must band together if they are to survive,RIPLEY takes the lead as she plans to trap the ALIEN and destroy it once and for all...interesting twist in the finally but this is definitely the worst of the 3,whoever it is not bad but it just seems like the wrong direction after the previous movie....",7,4,4,2 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," BLAST YOU INTO OBLIVION
","The first installment of the prequel trilogy is simply the worst and that's just that,once that fact is understood we can re enter the STAR WARS universe and find out why we started at episode IV in the first place,here we are going to experience the rise of VADER and the exploits of a young OBI WAN,the problems here mount up as the introduction of some characters just doesn't work,the likes of JAR JAR and WATTO just have no real impact but on the other hand the likes of DARTH MAUL and QUI GON JINN save the movie somewhat,the droid army here are comedic and this was a failure also being that droids would just be standard,here they are silly and clumsy an attempt to entertain children no doubt but the action scenes are very well done.all in all the movie can be ridiculous at times but seems to make up for it in other areas and ultimately it will be highly redeemed in the next 2 episodes.",7,4,5,30 January 2020

Alien," THE DAWN OF SCI-FI HORROR
","The introduction of sci-fi horror from RIDLEY SCOTT is way ahead of its time but at the same time was premature by way of film making,this will show in only 7 years in the second installment.the atmosphere of this 70s sci-fi horror is musky and the dialogue is standard,however the mere thrill of discovering the unknown is enough to keep you intrigued.the birth of the XENOMORPH is a frightening and believable scene and your fear grows for the crew.as I said the film lacks in areas that we will soon experience in the 80s but its definitely a unique franchise and will be very successful in years to come",8,5,6,1 February 2020

Aliens," WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY CUT THE POWER
","ALIEN from 1979 gets an 80s injection and with fantastic results,this is what the first film was lacking somewhat as I feel it was a little premature,RIPLEY is awakened only many years have passed and she is disorientated,a new mission lies ahead and RIPLEY is accompanied by a commando unit,nobody is aware of what lies ahead except RIPLEY and a failed attempt to pre-warn this arrogant and ignorant crew will soon be reaped as they set off to discover the faith of a human settlement.armed to the teeth with hi-tech weaponry and vehicles the crack unit are confident,RIPLEY however does not forget her experience and she is cautious when she encounters a new android.S,W,A.T is used here on there mission but an encounter with the unthinkable soon turns there mission into a desperate attempt to escape,loses mount up and panic takes over as an imminent attack becomes more obvious.these men will be tested to the limit and there weapons just wont be enough as this enemy shows intelligence.RIPLEY must use her experience and leadership to guide the survivors and soon her motherhood will be tested too as they try to escape this infested planet...a brilliant re boot with much needed graphics and a stellar cast,ALIENS is perfect sci-fi movie with exciting action scenes and excellent makeup...definitely the best ALIEN installment and still is..highly recommended",10,5,5,1 February 2020

Batman Begins," DIDN'T YOU GET THE MEMO ?
","BATMAN BEGINS is an excellent reboot of the DC legend,not to be compared to the lovable SAGA that spawned the 90s but only to be revered as an alternate version that sees the CAPED CRUSADER turn DARK KNIGHT.This installment goes back to the origins and focuses on BRUCE WAYNE'S rites of passage journey after inheriting his fathers legacy,BRUCE is rejecting his social status & has no interest in being the HEIR of the WAYNE legacy,haunted by his past BRUCE jumps ship & disappears without trace going in search of independent existence and personal justice.BRUCE challenges himself to limits of breaking and his efforts find him recruited by a secret NINJA society that exists to purge mankind from corrupted societies.After excelling in his training BRUCE rejects the orders of the BROTHERHOOD and has to explosively exit & return to GOTHAM to save the innocent,BRUCE WAYNE reemerges in GOTHAM only to find his EMPIRE under threat by a board who covet the shares but he soon learns that not all are corrupt as he reinvents himself as a symbol to strike fear into the fearless and THE BATMAN is born...the WAYNE empire will provide BRUCE with S.W.A.T as he infiltrates their advanced technology department & a once feared CAVE in the foundations of his mansion will provide THE BAT with a hidden domain...the criminals of GOTHAM soon get a taste of a new menacing adversary with extraordinary abilities & weapons not to mention a super weaponized AT vehicle - GOTHAM'S underworld wont know what hit them but the water runs deep through the city and BATMAN'S enemies emerge from the shadows for an explosive showdown that will decide the faith of GOTHAM CITY......CHRISTIAN BALE is excellent as both egos and CILLIAN MURPHY plays SCARECROW with chilling effect in this star studded reboot of the BATMAN franchise...very enjoyable and highly recommended.",9,4,4,24 March 2020

Legend," BROTHERLY LOVE
","This retelling of the CRAY twins fails miserably on to many levels,a brilliant duel portrayal of both brothers by TOM HARDY is destroyed by lack of story and character,the absence of the mother in this film is the absence of what compelled these infamous brothers to the height of the criminal underworld,bad plot bad story line and bad chronological events make this film mediocre at best...what a shame.",7,5,6,20 January 2020

1917," DOG FIGHT THE ENEMY FROM THE SKY AND THEN HELP HIM FROM THE BURNING COCKPIT
","This movie wiped the board @ the BAFTA,I personally think the ENGLISH love themselves and it was a foregone conclusion.This movie failed to even entertain me let alone amaze me and I love war movies,this movie came across like a stage play to me,everything from the sets to the wardrobe was stage like as nothing looked authentic at all,this subject matter is easily award worthy but not in this case.a couple of silver spoon soldiers are awarded a mission because one of them can read maps at least that's what they said,me personally I would have thought any soldier would need this attribute given the circumstances,anyway they set off across enemy lines on foot and they were promised they enemy is gone : )...sloppy muck,rats and dead bodies are the enemy as they waltz through the land unscathed but for a trench collapse,next they holed up @ a derelict farm and silly attempts at homely values through family stories are pointless and time consuming,now a visual spectacle as they watch their comrades shoot down the enemy in a dog fight only to run to the rescue of the pilot who is burning in the cockpit (no fear of immanent explosion) ohhh the compassion for the enemy pays off as the pilot stabs one of them,how negligent of them.the rest of the mission gets even more irritating as we soon see their is no compassion for their own soldier as they leave him soldier on alone...silly dangers and escapes round this off and the finally has a couple of bombs go off along the trenches.NO ENEMY,NO WAR,NO BATTLES...was probably worse than DUNKIRK and neither is a war movie in my opinion....................",6,5,8,3 February 2020

","THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy continues & THE JOKER takes center stage as GOTHAM suffers by the hand of a psychotic menacing clown who cares not for the proceeds of crime but only the mayhem & destruction he can entertain himself with , played brilliantly in a premature SWAN SONG by HEATH LEDGER , THE JOKER is hell bent on destroying THE BATMAN as he sees him as the only thing standing in his way , THE JOKER infiltrates the underworld & gains power in a coup d'tat as he tears GOTHAM apart in explosive and reckless fashion , meanwhile BRUCE WAYNE is contemplating how his alter ego is received by the public & whether or not he is a hero or criminal & a new hero is emerging in GOTHAM through the justice system as HARVEY DENT puts the criminals away for fun as GOTHAM'S D.A....THE JOKER uses every resource he can muster to turn GOTHAM against each other and RACHEL DAWES provides him with leverage as the love interest of both HARVEY & BRUCE...soon BATMAN is compromised & he is forced to make an impossible decision ,one that will ultimately turn hero's into villains & law into crime in a role reversal finale....PARALLEL SEQUEL that does not disappoint with a special performance from LEDGER ...RECOMMENDED.",9,4,4,27 March 2020

The Wind that Shakes the Barley," I'LL STAY IN THE CHICKEN COUP
","The only reason I gave this a 9 is because I gave MICHAEL COLLINS a 10 and it just isn't as good, after saying that this could be considered the flip side of the coin as we see what is going on in other parts of the country before and after the TREATY. we start off here with a bunch of lads in CORK running around like a hoard of elephants in work boots playing HURLEY, this is significant because the I.R.A were notorious for recruiting through the G.A.A, DAMIEN a local doctor played flawlessly by CILLIAN MURPHY doesn't share his brother TEDDY'S enthusiasm for the cause but a brutal unprovoked attack by the BLACK N TANS will set DAMIEN'S mind and his destiny on a new path.DAMIEN experiences the struggle first hand and the difficulty of recruiting poverty stricken rebels and the dire conditions of the training program were potential rebels train with HURLS instead of guns. DAMIEN gets consumed by the war and his role in it as his motivation grows with every effort, but when the TREATY splits the nation the two brothers find themselves torn and DAMIEN is questioning the cause once again. this movie is deep the BLACK N TAN brutality is visited repetitively and in gruesome fashion and there is a sympathetic angle for the rebels who at times are fighting even themselves, the movie is emotional at times through severe violence and the effort to sustain relationships under duress. a must see for this genre and very engaging, highly recommended.",9,5,5,1 March 2020

","The first installment of the ROCKY franchise,ok I know people are split on these movies and thats fine but I am a fan and these movies get me every time,you are not suppose to care about the reality of the situation you are not suppose to care about the possibilities you are just suppose the get on board like any other movie be it sci-fi or fantasy or whatever,it is a movie about a guy who dreams of grandeur but hasn't got a hope in hell and when an opportunity knocks on his door he answers it.this film has a love story and it is essentially this love that drives him.ROCKY is not to mental but is all physical and so his mind tells him he must use this because it is all he has.the movie has a good story line but obviously the title bout is the endgame and sought after in the movie it does not disappoint for 1976 in my opinion....this movie is MARMITE hate it or love it",8,4,4,23 January 2020

Rocky III," HE'LL KNOCK YOU INTO TOMORROW ROCK
","Definitely the worst installment here,ROCKY III seems rushed and slapped together a fast track to maintain the title and a Mr. MOTIVATOR foe that is 2 pages from an A-TEAM script help this movie fail somewhat.however as part of the ROCKY story this is a springboard into the development of ROCKY as a champion and how he must overcome the handbag bouts he was discretely given by the infamous MICK...theres not much else to say except B.A is bad ass",6,4,5,23 January 2020
The Godfather: Part III," HE DIPS HIS BULLETS IN STRYCHNINE
","The third installment of a world class trilogy sees MICHAEL on the tail end of his reign,MICHAEL wants out and to be 100% legit but this world he created has different ideas,tortured by the very nature of his habitat MICHAEL looks to pass the reigns but although there is a significant other he is far to undignified to portray the head.and so with the siblings grown and the gangster modernized MICHAEL is now a fish out of water and his money does the talking.this installment is considered the worst of the 3 but only as a part this is true,if you consider this trilogy as a chronological 1 piece then this episode is pivotal to the conclusion and therefore is equally justified,I am giving this an 8 as a stand alone episode.",8,4,6,21 January 2020

The Witch," SATAN REIGNS IN THE SHADOWS
",Brilliant horror from writer/director ROBERT EGGERS...this is not your hat & broom type genre but a true masterpiece of the SALEM WITCH HUNTS era...a young girl is adventurous by nature & yet she is bound by family duties some of WITCH she might be tainted by but her mind is powerful & she uses it to project herself into fantasy for entertainment..still a loving sibling by nature the girl is not phased by the torment of her younger siblings when they act devilishly in their playful routines...a family disaster sets the trail for a journey that will enlighten the girls mind and challenge it to the border of realism when the family will face an unseen intruder who tears at the emotional bond that holds it together...this girls mind is powerful and absent and the hunger to find answers leaves the door open for invitation...I loved this movie the dialogue the set pieces the story line are all beautifully achieved in this 17th century story where evil reigned in the shadows and challenged the power of the spoken word no matter who was reading it....BRILLIANT,9,5,8,6 June 2020

","This movie brings the VIETNAM war to the big screen in superb fashion,you will fear the V.C in this jungle bound swamp ridden environment as we see the HELL on earth war viewed through the eyes of a new recruit.everything here from the HUEY's to the terrain is spot on and you will feel like these young men are actually in VIETNAM as you accompany them,the enemy here is portrayed brilliantly as they become the jungle terrain and adapt a KAMIKAZE approach to overwhelm the foreign occupation,the psychology of these men is challenged in a restless fatigue and respect for each other diminishes through the ranks in an ultra violent fashion and personal vendetta finds a place in this relentless place.probably the best war movie ever made,definitely the best VIETNAM movie ever made...highly recommended",10,7,8,3 February 2020
Prometheus," THE GODS MUST BE ALIENS
","This prequel to the ALIEN saga sees a group of scientist search for the origin of mankind,a structure is exposed on a near by planet and the crew are compelled to investigate the ALIEN entity.with the help of a curious synthetic the crew set of to explore the unknown and try to unravel recent revaluations on earth that seem to suggest some sort of invitation from the stars.I see some negative reviews here but I would not agree that this installment is that bad,it is however completely different from ALIENS although the precursors are obvious.this movie intrigued me with the idea it suggested and it opens your mind a little,ALIEN beings are portrayed with not unbelievable existence and the XENOMORPH is premature,the synthetic is played well by MICHAEL FASSBENDER ,graphics and visuals are amazing at times and it did manage an original story.",7,4,5,2 February 2020

The Dark Knight Rises," I LIKE YOUR GIRLFRIEND
","I think we fall shy of the trilogy here & I think to many corners were cut ,after the first 2 installments we watched WAYNE MANOR burn to the ground but had a promise of a rebuild with significant renovation , now we re enter only to find BRUCE WAYNE has been consumed by the HARVEY DENT saga & the BATMAN hasn't been seen since , this in my opinion does not suffice when all you want is a fully pledged & developed BATMAN in his prime , however the introduction of BANE & CATWOMAN give the story some new blood & we have to except that the BATMAN will have to be nursed back to action.TOM HARDY is a brilliant actor but it seems he was miscast here & you would have thought these SUPER HEROS & VILLAINS could muster more than me-gar fist fights.an all star cast put in good performances but the plot seems weak and rushed at times as we are to except months are passing by with each scene , the sideways introduction of a possible boy wonder is interesting but never develops & never will so its a little disappointing...but it is the finale & we get plenty of action & explosions but a tired & weak BATMAN sets the mood so we have to except that it is the FINALE..WATCHABLE but DISAPPOINTING.",7,4,4,30 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," THE FORCE FALLS ASLEEP
","The STAR WARS universe is not justified in this reboot,they completely made a hash of things here with their efforts seemingly wasted on an attempt to recreate the same story again kinda like in a history repeats its self parody,unfortunately this does not compute and fails on a miserable level.its not humorous at all,the villain is a wimp in a not VADER costume and helmet,the hero is a girl not a boy ( go way ),the not STORM TROOPERS are not STORM TROOPERS because their helmets have bigger eyes,the robots are different because its 30 yrs later but the technology comparison is more like 300 yrs,the rebels are stuck in a timeless groundhog day and haven't progressed at all,I mean this stuff is riveting (NOT).The introduction of SOLO here is shameful as we find him scouring the universe for MONSTERS INC. aliens and CHEWY with an arm brace was the final straw for me..this was a mega attempt to cash in on an already well established franchise and the writers here did nothing to respect the previous installments as they cheat the essence of the story by COPYING and pasting....it is truly a massive FAILURE",3,8,11,27 January 2020
