3:10 to Yuma," One of the better westerns made in the past 30 years
","A bad outlaw is caught and his captors must get him on a train leaving at 3:10 to Yuma prison, but it's not easy with his band of outlaws trying to rescue him, not to mention Apaches and other setbacks.Westerns were great back decades ago in America and then they just got wore out, Spaghetti westerns then came to be the popular thing and they were just absolutely amazing movies to watch, they brought so much to the big screen and made nobodies superstars and made violence popular in cowboy films. The American westerns suffered and few decent ones have came out in my opinion in 30 years. The Unforgiven, Purgatory, Young Guns to name a few and then there was this movie, but it's a remake so I can't give it as much credit as I'd like to.An American western with an English actor as the hero and an Australian actor as the bad guy seems like a bad casting call to me, but it turns out it could've been worse. Christian Bale is a little too intense in all of his films and I think he has did some amazing films like American Psycho and The Machinist, but when he does action he goes a little over the top with it and I don't like him in these kind of roles. If I had to pick the worst actor on Earth it would be Russell Crowe, I hate him and usually will not watch a film he is in, but he surprised me by doing a great job in this film.Logan Lerman played Bales son in this film and although he is a Beverly Hills, California boy he did really great as a kid in a western, he looked and acted the part. I would have to give the best acting nod to Ben Foster on this one, he was superb. He has played many types of roles and this movie and his next movie after this one, 30 Days Of Night really showed he can do a bad guy really well.I wont talk about the comparisons with the original 3:10 to Yuma here, cause I think it has been one of those movies that have been forgotten by most people, and had never been heard of by the rest, so a remake was a fine idea. I will say the direction in this movie was so-so, I would've liked to have seen more excitement and just to have been taken away by the direction, but it was dull and basic. My other huge complaint is music, To me the single greatest thing that makes a western flow and makes the action jump off the screen is the score.....none of that here, I don't even recall hearing any music other than a cheap wanna-be Ennio Morricone ending credit tune.This is my second time watching it and it lost its feel big time the second time around, my vote might've been a higher number the first time I watched it. If you like westerns and have seen all the classics, you need to watch this. If you don't like westerns at all, but like action or perhaps even drama you might give this one a chance.",6,0,1,5 January 2010
50 First Dates," The nympho is the state bird of Ohio
","If you like chick flicks, this is a very lovey dovey movie, if you don't then move along this isn't for you. It's not at all funny, just very romantic.A man meets a girl and has a big crush and they decide to meet the next day for lunch, when he gets there to meet her she doesn't know him. He finds out she has short term memory loss and can remember everything from her past but just not anything after her accident, and everyday is like living the day of the accident over again.This man then knows he loves this girl and must make her fall in love with him every day of the week. Kinda sweet if you think about it LOL, but not my cup o'tea...Some good acting in this film. Sandler is always boring in movies where he isn't playing a character other than the character of Adam Sandler with a new name. Drew Barrymore is lovable and always perfect in her roles. A great supporting cast with Sean Astin as a steroid taking wimp, Blake Calrk as Drews dad, the great Amy Hill as the waitress at the caf√© and special appearances by people like Dan Aykroyd. Then you also had Rob Schneider who sucks in my book and wouldn't have a career without Sandler.This movie isn't funny except in the part where Barrymore beats Schneider up with a bat, which is shown in the trailer. It is a good 'date' movie and a very good chick flick full of a real love. I just don't like these types of movies, so I give it 3 stars out of 10.",3,1,4,9 April 2010
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Excellent villain, mate!!
","This is a great film for kids and the whole family...Beautifully directed and beautiful colors with a great cast of vocal talents.. Cruella De vil is one of the creepiest, most hated cartoon characters I have ever seen..A dog and his pet Roger, falls for another dalmatian and her pet Anita. Anita works for the fashion industry and her boss Cruella wants her puppies to make a coat of a new style, a spotted dalmatian one. Of course Roger and Anita wont give the dogs up, so Cruella has two crazy men do her work for her and steal them, along with many more a total of 99 puppies.The dogs send out a barking alert and the barking spreads from London all the way to De vil's house in the woods and then the dogs go out and try to find their pups..I loved a lot of things about this cute little toon. I loved Cruella and her evilness as a villain. I love how they portrayed the dogs as a family and the humans were secondary. I loved the twilight bark that helped them spread the messages to other dogs. I loved the cat that helped out with the rescue, he gave me some good laughs. The color and animation was beautiful. The movie speeds by really fast and didn't get boring...I liked it and give 5 stars out of 10 which is a lot for me to give a cartoon, esp. a Disney one.",5,0,6,11 April 2010
12 Monkeys," I'm so shocked this garbage is so highly praised
","I tend to hate big Hollywood movies cause they are garbage, and this one was a perfect example...I honestly had no idea it would be in IMDb's top 250.Willis plays a man in an underground post apocalyptic future and hes sent back in the past to try to find out information about the group of people responsible. He goes back and ends up in the wrong place, or perhaps wrong time. Then a bunch of crap happens and I paid attention but was so bored I didn't really care.I was making mental notes as I watched to kill boredom. I was thinking it had some great set designs. I was thinking that Bruce Willis had no hair, but yet he looked older than usual. I was thinking the acting was great and Brad Pitt actually did a great job for a change, he's usually so boring. I also was thinking the music was not at all fitting.Terry Gilliam has directed a few movies I like and he did a good job here with 12 monkeys, not a great job just a good one. Not his best work as a director, and its sad cause he could've done so much to add character to this dull film.I like many sci-fi films, but this one was a bit too crazy for me, We knew the future, he claimed it couldn't be changed, yet he seemed to fight to save it. It has all kinds of tie-ins from the future and the past and they try to make it seem surprising, but its kind of like they are treating the viewers like idiots. I mean we all get where the film is going from the first 10 minutes....Such a let down, I was not thrilled, I was not shocked, I was not excited...I was bored...really damn bored!",2,20,46,30 March 2010
The 13th Warrior," This movie sucks!
","I hate viking movies, but my review is not biased its just my opinion.The plot is about a guy vanished from his land and told to go up north and be Ambasador and he is in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up having to help a bunch of viking fight a bunch of crazy men in bear suits. --- OK does that excite you...This movie took so long to get going, It is almost an hour into the movie before anything remotely exciting starts to happen. When it does happen the direction is so bad you cannot see half of what is being shown. John McTiernan directed it and writer Michael Crichton was calling a lot of the shots so I don't know who to blame. John often does a pretty good job as director so I guess it's Michaels fault. Crichton has written some nice work but I am not a fan of his work here.The acting was pretty bad, it seems like a reject cast from Braveheart. Most of the cast is English, Irish or Scot and they are playing Vikings, that is just funny. Antonio Banderas as an Arab with his strong ass Spanish accent was too much for me, one of the worst casting mistakes ever. The movie was so laughable it was impossible to take serious.What the hell is up with the language thing? Ahmed only speaks Arabic yet he quickly learns their language which is Norse, and as soon as he learns it they all suddenly speak English. Perhaps it was a way of not making the viewer have to read subtitles the whole movie, but it was absolutely stupid to me. I am glad Omar Shariff didn't go along and have to translate everything for Banderas' character like he did the first 30 minutes of the movie because that was very annoying.As I have said the direction was so sloppy during battles, the camera was right there inches away and making it impossible to see anything - I hate fight scenes like that, pull back you idiot let me see the fight!! I thought it was funny with the enemy here as well, thousands of men in bear skin outfits, I would've been more scared a bear would kill me than those men. If the men all had a bear outfit then that land must've been crawling with bears, but thats just my thought.I also have to point out the old wise woman they go to see who talks like Yoda... brilliant lol, I am being sarcastic. I thought it was embarrassing that filmmakers always use Yoda as the wisest of them all and have mocked him in movies every since Empire Strikes Back came out.BAD BAD movie, thats all I can say. It's is very slow, it has stupid actors playing parts way out of their league and race also. It has the 13 warriors going to protect a town from bad things, so I recommend you watching The Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven to get that. It has mid-evil battles with mysterious creatures, I recommend Lord Of The Rings for that.If you love viking movies and don't care about story or facts or good acting or good directing then you might like this, if you are just one of those people who watch movies and doesn't analyze it then maybe you can tolerate it more than I.",2,1,5,12 January 2010
12 Angry Men," One of the best film's I have ever seen.
","I knew this was a popular film, but as I came here to review it tonight I noticed it is currently #7 On IMDb's top 250 and with good reason. It has so much to offer and has twelve very unique individuals, they all exploded with personality.I had always wanted to see this movie, but had no idea really what it was going to be about. The title tells me its about a jury obviously, but I didn't know if it would be a trial and then a jury or what. I love how it turned out, I found no flaws in this film. I would give it a perfect 10 but that is reserved for my all-time faves.It quickly goes from the courtroom to the jury room, only showing the young defendant for a brief moment. We never hear the trial but 11 of the men come in and start off about how it is an easy verdict and the kid is guilty case closed! One man (Fonda) is not that definite, he is not saying the kid is innocent, he isn't saying he's guilty, he just thinks they should talk about it.They all get mad at Fonda but they start talking it out, we then get to hear the case via their discussions. As time passes more and more facts surface and they start to change their votes one by one. I personally was on the edge of my seat the entire time so eager for more. It really starts to show these men as individuals and we get an insight in the minds of men, not just the jurors but each man there is representing people as a whole and thats the beauty of the film. By the end of it all they are all on the not guilty side and the journey to get there is some of the best time you will ever have watching a movie.Each actor was amazing, all stand alone as separate visions of man, some younger, some older, some angry, some sad, some bitter, those who seek reason and those who place blame.The directing was great and to spend all but 3 minutes of this film in one room and keep it alive must've been a real challenge for the director. The room is somewhat big, but he had to get up close and personal with the men, and also show the viewer a sense of claustrophobia that one must feel. A fan that didn't work on a hot day and rain forcing them to close windows were beautiful touches. The large wall of windows with a tease of the outside world and most of the men bluntly stating they have some where else they need to be. It was just a beautiful film.100 percent drama, all dialog, but simply amazing to sit thru, as nice to watch as it is to listen to the arguments and reason. I can't say anything that hasn't been said about this film, I am no critic, I just love movies and few touch me and move me and entertain me as this one has.",9,0,0,10 January 2010
10 Things I Hate About You," teenage girls, here's your movie...everyone else...not so much!
","I had put this movie off as long as I could, I dreaded watching it so bad, but it wasn't horrible. I never wanna see it again though. It's obviously for teenage girls and gay guys, and not meant to please anyone else.Its a movie based on Shakespears The Taming of the Shrew. A new kid comes to the clich√© high school and gets a big crush on a girl. The girl is out of his reach and she has the hots for another boy who's full of himself. The new kid at school thinks he can get the girl if he can show her how sweet he is and keep her attention long enough. One problem is in the way and that is the girl can't go on dates unless her older sister can. Her older sister is an individual and doesn't 'need' a man so the new kid and his new found friend come up with a big scheme to get the older sister a date and ultimately get his crush close to him...Teens...ugh...is there anything more pathetic than high schoolers? This movie tried so hard to hit on EVERY teen clich√© ever put on film. It tries so hard to be 'hip' and cool and makes my stomach churn with disgust that the world is full of people like this.The writing was nothing good here, it was something you have seen a billion times. The directing wasn't meant to be great and it wasn't, production was run of the mill and all it offered was a so so soundtrack by many hot artists at the time.I hate most of these teen actors and this one was full of crappy leads. Julia Stiles actually auditioned for the role of the younger sister and I think she would've done better at that. She does much better as a snobby teen cause she looks the part of a stuck up B*tch, not the part of a 'cool' rocker chick. I guess though shes rather ugly and doesn't look like the kind of girl a guy would crush over. Heath Ledger is a horrible actor, esp. in his early years. Its sad he started getting better just before he died, but here he didn't amaze me at all. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a decent teen actor and looks so much like the cool innocent kid we all knew and loved back in high school...kudos to him, I also think his friend in the movie David Krumholtz does a great job.Principal Perky (Allison Janney) was hands down the best character on the whole movie even if she only had about 5 minutes of screen time. Andrew Keegan would've done so much better in Ledgers role, but Ledger could not have pulled off his part...So I guess the casting is my biggest flaw with this film, also many of the extras kept looking right directly into the camera and god if I noticed it, why couldn't the director.I gave it 2 out of 10 because I didn't completely hate it. I have seen worse. I can only suggest it to the teen flick/ chick flick lovers though.. I hope to never see it again",2,1,4,30 March 2010
28 Weeks Later," A sequel that doesn't live up to the first - no surprise!
","I thought the first movie was good, it wasn't perfect, but good. The thing that held the first movie was the production side of it, Danny Boyle's direction and the score as well as great acting. Here, we had nothing but a decent story and that along works for lower budget horrors, but ones with such a huge funding as this one had, we expect more.Its 28 weeks later and the rebuilding of England is under way. The city is controlled under U.S. military and only a small section of one city is allowing people to come back. One man who had left his wife cowardly during an attack has fled and is now working with the military to rebuild the city and his two children who had been in America return to see him an begin their new life.One day the little boy claims he has almost forgotten what his mother looks like, so he and big sister sneak out to their old house and find their mother is there and wasn't killed by the infected after all. She ends up in the city and medics soon learn she is in fact infected herself, but somehow able to not be in rage like the others. She later bites her cowardly husband and he then turns the city one by one and all hell once again breaks out.The direction in the movie was bad, there were no beautiful shots, nothing impressive and an obvious rip off at times to Boyle's original work. He had too many close-ups and I found myself so often hating the cinematography. Conducter John Murphy only had two weeks to work on his score and it was nothing great either, almost entirely recycled music from the first movie. The movie finally picks up about half way through, but by this time it's so predictable that it is a let down.Much of the acting is good, Robert Carlyse had been offered a part in part one but refused and here he does a great job. John Murphy also did a great job as Doyle, I kept wondering where I had seen this guy before and he had did a great job years before playing the title role in the movie Dahmer.I didn't hate this movie, but I was disappointed. There wasn't a lot of personal encounters with the infected. This was not a zombie movie, but it lacked what zombie movies have and that is some focus on the monster. We watch these types of movies to get scared and see these creatures and here, as in part one, the infected were not the main characters. That type of movie making is not good for horror, the drama is nice, but we need more scares.I can recommend it to people because its good for a watch. I gave it 4 out of 10 stars.",4,0,1,8 April 2010
21," Interesting the first time, boring the second!
","This is my second time viewing this and I enjoyed it and was on the edge of my seat the first time, but here on my second I saw this movie had nothing but a good story thats no fun to hear twice.This movie is based on true events and the screenwriters adapted the film from Ben Mezrichs book 'Bringing down the house: The Story Of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas For Millions'. The book was also used for a movie from 1994 called The Last Casino.The title of the book tells the story well enough but I will elaborate..A boy who's extremely smart gets sucked in by a teacher who knows the kid will be good with numbers and counting cards. The teacher has a few other students and he takes them to Vegas and they count cards and win millions of dollars. It's not as easy as it all sounds and they have a good system working together and they have casino guards constantly trying to catch them.Not only is main character Ben realizing that life can be fun and that he might be letting his dreams slip, he is also finding he's losing his friends and changing from what he wants to be.The real story is about some Asian kids at M.I.T. but here its mostly played by white kids. The actors were okay. Jim Sturgess was brought to my attention first in the wonderful Across The Universe movie and Jim did a wonderful job, it's one reason I picked 21 up to begin with. He is English and his voice coach did a wonderful job teaching him to speak more American. I am a huge fan of Kevin Spacey and usually think he chooses great roles. Laurence Fishburn is so so too, and I like seeing him as a bad guy in a co-staring role, never liked him in large doses so here he is fine. I do however want to point out I hate the Asian kid Aaron Yoo, he plays the same guy in every movie and is rather annoying. Josh Gad is another young actor I want to see less of, he's always playing the fat clich√© geek friend in these movies and just does a horrible job.This movie is okay, I wont lie and put it down, because I did enjoy it the first time, I will say all and all it's a nice little film...It's neither great or horrible..its average...worth a watch.. 4 out of 10 stars",4,0,0,4 April 2010
The Alamo," much better than the John Wayne version.
","This is the story of the Alamo in Texas where a group of soldiers tried to hold off the Mexicans from entering Texas and getting to Sam Houstons camp. Col. Travis gathered up many volunteers to help him fight including Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett. The battle happened and they were out numbered greatly and almost all completely killed. Later the Mexicans were ambushed by Sam Houston's soldiers and in less than 18 minutes the war was over, those who died at the Alamo died for nothing.This is NOT a remake of the John Wayne classic as many people say. It is the same story, because it is based on a moment of history, but this version is way more accurate. Waynes version had most of the men very heroic and it was way over the top and made out to make it more glorious than it was. This movie had the men being more human. Davy Crockett, although still to this day is revealed as a legend, in this film he tells his story of how he is nothing more than a man who did a few great things, but is not the giant he was made out to be.I liked this story and thought it was entertaining. The direction was pretty good and acting was good as well. I liked Billy Bob Thorton and loved Patrick Wilson. Dennis Quaid, although on screen very little, did a great job. I must say that Jason Patrick leaves much to be desired as an actor, however. The music in this movie was horrible and was perhaps the worst thing about the film.The film plays hard on clich√©s, but it got to the point faster. The war starts rather quick in this film and there was a lot of action. I would recommend it to those who like historical, war or westerns. 4/10 stars.",4,1,2,12 June 2010
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," I'm hungry! Let's get some f'n french toast!!
","A movie that could've been good with MAJOR changes.. Many of the main actors sucked and the fact that the story was about changing a person in order to make them presentable is a horrible concept.This movie is about a man who is a bit of a geek, a single man with an average job who just happens to be a virgin, when his co-workers find out they make it their goal to get him some action. Most of them are the average 'dudes' who get with the less than average women and are satisfied with that lifestyle.Steve Correl is the star and his character is fine with the way things are, he's tried a few times in life to get some action but his dorky side won and the women ran out on him, he eventually meets a woman and she has kids and he find himself happy for once, but sex is still nothing he's too anxious about, his fear is in charge. Finally he starts to revolve his life around her and realizes he must change in order to keep her...As one would know before they even start watching the film, it's all gonna work out.Does it really work out though? This man may be a geek, but no one should ever change for anyone, I mean you have to get yourself out there to get sex, but you don't have to lie or change who you are. By the time this movie is over he sells all of his collectibles and she has him starting his own business. Some people call it growing up, I consider it giving in. I hated that aspect of the movie, When you're a geek or a weirdo you're unique and original and lovable and special, and the aftermath of this movie would be that he's married, he has love but he also now has her kids, her life and a job which takes up his time and he will become boring miserable and pathetic like most married men are..they don't show you that part.. This movies message was a bad one.Director Judd Apatow did an okay job here, he never impresses, but with this kind of movie no one pays any attention to anything other than acting and story. The story did have some funny moments, Judd himself helped with one of the funniest scenes as an Indian call support hotline voice when Andy calls to get rid of his erection.Steve is a good actor, so far I have enjoyed his work and he was likable here as well. Jane Lynch did a good job as Paula and some of the other actors were good too. Kat Denning's playing Andy's girlfriends daughter, Jonah Hill as a customer at the We Sell Your Stuff On Ebay store and of course Gerry Bednob playing the old Indian worker at Andy's store was great.Then we have the crappy actors who shared so much screen time and ruined the movie; Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan. WOW does it get any worse than Seth Rogan, where did this horrible actor come from - I hate this guy!!! Paul Rudd, does ANYONE like him, wow what a waste.Bottom line this movie could've been funny if they had changed so much of the story and not changed Andy, changing people sucks. Thats all Hollywood does is try to tell people they suck at being themselves, you can get laid without being just like everyone else. Also this movie needed some good acting..It had it's moments but I only give it 2 stars because I watched it in a theater and hated it and just watched the unrated DVD and it still didn't add anything great...Most people will like it because people will laugh at anything these days.",2,4,8,9 April 2010
54," Great movie - not sure why it wasn't more popular.
","When I first watched this movie, I just knew it would be one of those films I would watch every couple years and it would never grow old to me. This made maybe my 10th viewing and I still enjoyed it.Studio 54 in the late seventies was THE place to be, clubs weren't as relevant as they are nowadays and even so 54 was the kind of place that people off the streets could hang out with movie stars and rock singers, anyone who was anyone had to be there. It was ran by a man named Steve Rubell and he was somewhat of a god in that world. Everyone wanted to be his friend, and he just wanted money, sex and drugs. He was embezzling money from his own company and not letting the IRS find out about it, but when word got out his place was shut down quickly and he went to jail.Ryan Phillippe plays Shane, a character based on Tieg Thomas, a bi-sexual party boy who became a bartender and a star because of his time at 54. Shane however was straight and fell in love with a soap star on this movie and he and the girl he falls for have to realize that life and love is more important than selling yourself out.Side note...there is another director's cut of this film out there based more on Tieg's life having lots more sex and bisexual encounters, director Mark Christopher may release it anytime, he got lots of clearance for the DVD release, but there's still lots more to be seen on DVD.Mark did a really great job directing this movie film and with all the lights and action going on in the club he captured the right things at the right times, his use of slow motion is perfect. He is mostly famous for doing gay cinema and shorts like those seen on the 'Boys Life' series, and his work here far outshines those.Acting wise this was a gem. Ryan Phillippe is a good guy, I have met him and he's such a great guy in person that I could never judge him on film, but I will say he did a great job and thats not biased, he's nothing at all like the cocky Shane character he played here and he did good with the Jersey accent. Mike Myers may have did his best acting job ever here, we've all seen him do these crazy characters such as Austin Powers but here he's playing a real person and this movie is not at all comedy and he pulls off a serious acting job, it is so hard to believe this is Mike Myers. Neve Cambell also did her best work here in my opinion, early in her career but trying to play an older more sophisticated Jersey girl in the New York circle. Other great actors included Breckin Meyer, Heather Matarazzo, Ellen Dow and Sela Ward. Salma Hayak was the balance though, that girl cant act in a movie unless Robert Rodriquez is directing her.Of course disco was the music of this time, and I thought the music here was very fitting, the songs were as important as anything when one of your stars is the club and the dance floor. Nice original music too, and glad to see a Bachman-Turner Overdrive thrown in the mix.Great movie I recommend it to drama lovers, bio-pic lovers, disco lovers and just anyone looking for a way to kill an afternoon enjoying a film. 6 out of 10 stars.",6,1,2,9 April 2010
The Fast and the Furious," one of those movies that is aimed at a certain type of person
","If you devote every dime you get into a little ugly car that runs fast has loud speakers so you can play annoying rap music and show it off to your other idiot friends...yea you know if you are one of those types...dork...An undercover cop poses as a street racer so he can find out who is responsible for the hijacking of trucks and the valuable equipment inside. The cop, Brian gets in so deep and close to the group of guys that he doesn't want to bust them when he finds out the truth and yadda yadda.I like car movies and good chases, but this was a bit too cheesy for me. With all the clich√©s, the bad dated rap music, the little ugly cars that aren't at all cool. As I said the people who are into that junk eat these movies up, but I think they are so cheesy, all the 'bros' and slang these people use is annoying as hell...I wanted them all to die - crash and burn you fools.It has a lot of races, and some action, but still tame by real action standards..Rob Cohen makes a lot of those big budget wanna be action movies, some are okay, but I think his big star casting choices hurt his films. They sell at the box office, but we real movie fans hate these big hyped actors that are 'Hollywood's finest' - yea Hollywood's most overrated..Paul Walker is a horrible actor, he does good in movies about surfers, but I could never take him serious as a cop or a bad a**. Although he was good in Running Scared...Vin Diesel is just one of those actors that sucks but hes big and muscular and gained a big fan base and he keeps getting these roles because of his size. He was great in Pitch Black, but after that I wish he had quit. The guy playing Vince, Matt Schulz is another very horrible actor. Poor Ja Rule, I like Ja Rule, not his music or his acting but I think he seems like a cool guy, but he shows here he cannot act.I will say I am a fan of Michelle Rodriquez and think although she plays the same character in everything shes ever done, I still like her. Ted Levine is one of my favorite actors so nice to see him here.This film isn't horrible, but it isn't a great action film. It has a lot of big stars, big production and big hype but it's not got the story and action to back it up... I give it 3 out of 10 stars because it had its moments.",3,2,6,14 April 2010
Twilight," The moral of the story is that when you fall in love your life is ruined
","A girl named Bella moves to a new place with her dad after her mom runs off with a baseball player. This girl goes to a new school and doesn't really fit in because she is a loner and not normal like all the other girls. She soon learns of the mysterious Cullen family, extremely beautiful, all stick to themselves and very intriguing. She gets the hots for one of the boys, Edward, but he doesn't seem to like her and in fact seems to hate her. Soon he saves her from an accident and reveals he has super speed and super human strength and his secret is out to her. They begin to talk and she questions these things and he claims to know nothing, but the truth finally comes out and they admit to each other they are in love. He reveals that he is in fact over a hundred years old and is a vampire, and she is the least bit scared of him. His family isn't too happy about her knowledge because they are all vampires that don't kill humans and she is very tasty to them. They fear they aren't safe but soon most of them accept her. Meanwhile, a group of bad vampires are killing people and it's making the Cullens get scared as they know the wolves (yes there's werewolf shapshifting Native Americans here too, but we'll get to them in the sequel) will think its them. The bad vamps soon find out about Bella and they want her bad. The Cullens then must fight to protect themselves and Bella and Edward soon finds that the only way she will be truly safe is if he no longer has anything to do with her. She, on the other hand, knows the only way she will be happy is if Edward turns her and gives her what she wants..a future of forever with him.OK so the first time I watched this I hated it with passion. I thought this is no vampire movie, there is no blood, no fangs, no horror and it just sucks horribly. Vampires don't sparkle gold in the sun, thats stupid. I still agree with all of my first impressions, but my second time watching it I watched it as a love story and it made me see it in a new light (no pun intended).The movie did good with making them mysterious, yet making them try to blend in to some degree. At the same time I think, if you're going to go to school and be 'normal' then why not blend in and make friends and be normal for real.I didn't like stupid things like how Bella seemed to freak out because Edward could run a whole of like 20 feet in super fast time, yet she didn't seem at all amused of how he stopped a car with his bare hands.Direction was really good, so was cinematography and editing. There was beautiful shots in this film and especially the use with lighting. The bright yet pale color of the sky to symbolize daylight with no sunlight. The use of makeup to make the Cullens so pale too. Acting was good here I thought Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattison worked well together. I am not a huge worshiper of the movies like many but I will say these kids did a good job, Roberts accent and all and his acting period is good, and its not fair to put him down simply because you hate the movie. Billy Burke did a good job and normally I am not a fan of his. I think Peter Facinelli, Taylor Lauher, Jackson Rathborne and Cam Gigandet were great too. I don't know her real or character name, but the girl playing the red headed bad vampire was great too..too bad she was replaced later.This movie gained tons of hype because of pretty boys and good rock soundtracks and horror thats vanilla, which made little girls everywhere, as well as gay boys go crazy over this. It spawned a whole new breed of bubble gum movie fans and had many people trying to swear this movie was perfect. This movie is a fad movie and in 20 years if not sooner will be forgotten about. It is okay and it's a nice way to kill a couple hours, it IS NOT horror in anyway and is 100 percent drama mostly aimed at young girls. The music is modern and cool and I give it 5 out of 10 stars.",5,0,2,3 May 2010
1941," a lot of great actors, but the movie was horrible
","First off I have to mention all of the wonderful actors that did such a great job; Lucille Benson (reprising a role from DUEL), Slim Pickens, Susan Backlinie (reprising her role from JAWS), Ned Beatty, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Murray Hamilton, Robert Stack, Christopher Lee, John Candy, Toshiro Mifone, Warren Oates, Elisha Cook, Jr, Eddie Deezen, Dub Taylor, Joe Flaherty, Don Calfa, Dick Miller and small roles and cameos for people like James Caan, Samuel Fuller, John Landis, Mickey Rourke (in his film debut), Michael McKean and David Lander together but not as Lenny and Squiggy, also from Laverne & Shirley we have Penny Marshall, and of course in my opinion the movies true star was Bobby Dicicco.Actors I didn't like but I will include are Tim Matheson and Nancy Allen as well as Treat Williams. I normally like Treat but he was awful in this film.This movie is basically a lighthearted spoof of events that actually did happen at various times during the early 40's. The Japanese did try to invade LA, and airplanes were shot at thinking it was a Japanese raid. Zoot suiters did battle it out with USO boys and many events here are all true just put together for this movie.As far as the plot to the movie, its basically about the Japanese along with a Nazi comrade trying to invade Los Angelas. The great General Stillwell is in town and trying to watch a movie, his soldiers are at a USO party. One soldier is trying to get a girl, but another kid named Wally wants her more. Another soldier is flying a plane trying to get a woman to sleep with him because she loves planes. There is a lot of weird things going on in here that should make it interesting, but it doesn't. Just random events that all connect to the threat of an invasion.Spielberg directed this movie and its considered his biggest flop, with good reasoning. It offers nothing, its a mess, its very sloppy. I only laughed once and that was at the Slim Pickens part and director Brian DePalma actually contributed that section. Pickens also spoofs his own self from DR. STRANGELOVE. The movie opens with a spoof of JAWS with the original woman playing her part.awe what to say...the movie was a mess, I hated the score by John Williams, the direction offered nothing, actors were many, but characters were few, the screenplay was silly and the scenes were flawed...I wouldn't recommend it to a single person...it was really bad 1/10 stars",1,36,60,16 April 2010
28 Days Later...," Infected - but not zombies, get it right!
","I recall when this first came out I kept hearing it was a zombie film and I love zombies so I watched it. I can see where people got that idea, but these were in no way zombies, just infected people wanting to attack.This film is about a man who wakes up in London and the entire cities population seems to have vanished. He is confused and soon finds the city is crawling with these crazy blood thirsty killers. He finds a couple of survivors and they tell him what has happened and they go out and their only purpose is basically to survive. They later find more survivors and hear a radio transmission from soldiers telling them to come to Manchester because there is a cure there. They head out and find there is no cure, no other survivors, but only randy soldiers.Danny Boyle had directed a few movies I enjoyed, Trainspotting being the one that stood out to me the most. His direction on 28 days later was some of the most beautiful cinematography and direction combined footage I have ever seen on film. His long wide angle shots and use of color was breathtaking. He used an 8mm for some flashback scenes and even those were so fitting and brilliant. The first of the movie with the boy waking up nude was a beautiful concept too. There is no better way of symbolizing being alone than being naked and bare. That scene was an homage to The Day Of The Triffods, but Danny's over the head shot showing how stripped and naked Cillian was, just gave such a nice setting and direction for the movie.Being able to get some heavy traffic areas of London shut down to shoot the scenes was wonderful, there wasn't C.G.I. and fake shots, it was real and definitely the best post apocalyptic deserted shots I have ever seen in a film before or sense. Dannys use of dark colors for the gloomy side of live and bright colors where life was to be symbolized was brilliant too. Later at the mansion the reverse of color after we find out the guards are wicked is such a nice trick too.The music and score for this film was so perfect too. It set the mood so well. Acting was great by everyone. Cillian Murphy did a magnificent job especially.I liked this film lots, and this was maybe my 3rd or 4th viewing and it still had the ability to keep me interested. I think I walked away thinking that people are the true monsters of the world.This is a drama, this is a horror, these are not zombies but they will satisfy zombie lovers as well as those who hate zombies. 6 out of 10 stars.",6,0,1,7 April 2010
Across the Universe," Such a beautiful movie with great story and great Beatles songs
","Set in the 60's it follows the life of many young people during that time. The main characters are a young woman named Lucy and a young man named Jude. Lucy is an American upper class girl who's boyfriend is away in the war. Her brother is away at college and she lives the normal life of a teenage girl. Jude is a poor boy from Liverpool who is the bastard child of an American soldier. He thinks because his father is at a college that perhaps he is a professor so he goes there to meet him, only to find he is a janitor. He meets up with Max and becomes friends and Max is Lucy's brother. Max drops out of college and he and Jude head to New York where they find a room with Sadie (a hot singer). Soon a guitar player moves in by the name of Jo Jo and after Lucy's man is killed in the war she decides to go crash there as well. Prudence comes in through the bathroom window and makes the house complete.Lucy and Jude fall in love, Sadie and Jojo seek fame and Prudence leaves to find happiness soon after Max is drafted. Jude does art to make money and Lucy gets highly involved in protesting the war. Eventually all the things collide and love and friendship and the beauty of song keep them all together and makes everything all right...All you need is love right? - This movie uses 30 wonderful Beatles songs and references many others as well as other bands from Creedence to Janis to Jimi.What a great movie. I am not always big on musicals but when they get them right its wonderful. Here with such a great band as The Beatles you can't go wrong. This movie was so on point with the way things were in the 60's and how the war made so many people start getting involved with ways of protesting and standing up for our rights. The subtle messages like with Max and Lucy giving up the great wealthy life to go live a not so comfy one in New york, yet New York was the place to be.The direction is absolutely perfect and so many of the sets and colors and locations and all is breathtaking, it is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever watched. The actors did an amazing job, Jim Sturgess even looked like a Beatle. Wood did pretty good, although I am not a fan of her work. I liked them adding Joe Cocker in the movie but could have done with out Bono, he is just annoying to me. Salma Hayek is also an actress that disgusts me. Most of the actors did wonderful though.This movie was really good, but it was missing some great Beatles songs. The movie had an ongoing story up until about an hour into it then it kind of went astray. I hated the Benefit of Mr. Kite part and from there on the movie suffered. It got really slow and started adding many parts that had no relevance but were used simply as art. When art goes with the story it's beautiful, but art for arts sake in a film is boring.The first time I watched this film I gave it 9 stars, but here on my 3rd viewing I had to face the facts that the last half of this movie wasn't as fun as the first. I gave it 8 out of 10 stars, cause it is a great film that I highly praise.",8,0,1,3 May 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Goes off in a completely different direction and is a major letdown
","Edward fears for Bella and he and all the Cullens leave town. They claim they aren't aging and people are getting suspicious. Bella is devastated and misses her Edward for many months. Finally she realizes he is still there looking over her, and she thinks if she is in danger he might actually come to her. She does everything to live recklessly and this leads her to her old friend Jacob. Jacob is a hands on type of boy and he helps her fix up some old junk motorcycles. He falls in love with her, and she even begins to fall for him in a needy desperate sort of way. He admits to her that he is a werewolf and he hates the Cullens. When one of the Cullens show up to tell her that Edward isn't doing so well they both flee to find him. They kiss and make up and he comes back to the states with her. He and Jacob become enemies and Bella tells Jacob bluntly that she loves Edward. She goes back to wanting to be turned and it was even promised to the high priests of the vampire clan that she would be, but so far nope...where will part three and four take us? What a let down. I wanted so many things to happen here but they didn't happen. The only good thing about this was the love between Bella and Edward and this stupid movie takes that away from it. It adds a new leading man and becomes so dry and boring. I didn't see anything good about this film really. I loved how they showed her going months and months of missing Edward and how they showed her love for him, but hated how they didn't show his love for her.Direction was nothing good here and those stupid C.G.I. werewolves were horrible looking. Production values were bad in this film. What was with the old wise high priest vampires? They were so corny and cheesy and then Dakota Fanning was just horrible and useless here. I hated the whole side story aspect. The wolves and how they were all just cocky teenage boys. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) really got in shape here and cut his long ugly hair which made him a good sex symbol to keep the girls attracted to this movie, but Edward is who she loves and thats where they should have stayed, but I get it, the wolves and Cullens need to be enemies. Edward looks so much worse in this movie, his eyebrows are bushy, his teeth are less clean, he looks older and just not as good, which is great because he's suppose to have that tired look. Jacob has the ugliest nose of any human being I have ever seen, just had to point that out. The mention of marriage is nice way to end it.All and all, its a let down. It is boring and badly directed. I didn't care about the characters, it brought nothing new to the table and took away anything beautiful the first film gave us.. You have to see it if you like the first one, but I would advise you to wait until the others came out so you can watch them all together. 4/10 stars",4,5,6,3 May 2010
8 Mile," I thought I would hate it, but I liked it a lot.
","I have had this movie for so long and never wanted to see it, I started to give it away and thought what the hell I'll put it in, if it doesn't catch me in 10 minutes I will give it away, and ended up getting locked in and enjoying it.I don't like rap music anymore and think it has sucked since the 90's and this movie was set in 95 when rap was still good, the music played on this movie took me back with stuff like Naughty By Nature, Biggie and 2Pac. I also hate emenim and still do, but he didn't bother me here, I thought he did a wonderful job.It's about a white kid trying to get ahead in a black man's world of the rap music business. He is scared and at times intimidated, but ultimately knows if you want something in life you have to get it for yourself because no one will just simply give it to you.The film only used music as its core, but the story is not about music, the film is about life. It is about the things people have to deal with and over come. It is about making sacrifices and becoming a man.The language is bad, but I think a lot of kids should watch it in their teen years because it has a good message, my point of bringing up language is that I think it should be shown in schools to teach people that life isn't easy and you don't know what people go through and no matter how bad you have got it, you can still make it in this tough world.I think it's a good drama, so even if you hate rap music or emenim still watch the movie if you like a deep touching story. The acting was great too with Kim Basinger and Britney Murphy (R.I.P.) really standing out.",6,0,0,9 January 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Wow what an interesting film
","First time I watched this movie as a kid I expected a film like Star Wars, but I was disappointed. I later found,like myself many people thought the music was great and the scenes were beautiful, but the movie had no point. I just watched it again for the second time and was amazed, my opinion has changed and I think this film is wonderful.It's one of those movies that is like a song with metaphors and nothing hinting at the truth and everything hinting at the speculation as to what it is about. Art and music, and in cases such as this film, it's for the viewer to walk away with what he needs to take from it.. you are not told how to feel, or told an explanation as to what you see, you just watch and feel whatever, and most people will have different views. The writer and/or director were inspired by things and had their own visions as to what they were trying to show you and what they were trying to say, yet they made sure not to be blunt or factual about these truths and reasoning.This film starts with several minutes of silence and a black screen which to me symbolizes nothing..nothing is what we all came from, not a god but some unknown particles bonding to form something that became something else... The film does not show these evolutionary happenings, yet it goes into the dawn of man. The apes that we derived from - scared beings who must learn and grow. They must defend themselves from other creatures just like them, but different..enemies...competitors. I must say the monolith was what made the film first get truly interesting..I see that as symbolic of the things that we know nothing about, yet the thing we worship, desire and crave. The apes are intrigued and eventually like all things, the monolith becomes apparent and a steak in reality. The beasts..us.. eventually learn to kill and life gets better, life gets worse, life gets going. Man's true nature is to kill, protect and survive.The movie goes straight from the dawn of man to space. To me this symbolizes many things, one we all know what happened so why retell it, also the past straight into the future says that once man learned to kill and hate and survive thats all we have basically done for centuries...Love and hate, life and death, faith and free will all go hand in hand and space is our way of trying to search for life in other places, perhaps to learn, but definitely to conquer, it is mans way of needing more, needing answers. Space is the one thing untouched by man and it was indeed 'a final frontier' waiting to be discovered.We see inside a space craft and the civilized world it seemed to have. The truths of how it would be, the call for your 'Christian' name, the lobbies with Howard Johnsons promotions and big business getting its greedy paws in a space-station if there were ones...very subtle truths.The spaceship is ran by a super-computer called the HAL-900 which for a movie in 1968 foretold a greater truth that the world relies too much on machines, they place their life in this computer. It's a great factor and a major plot to this film.They find another monolith on the moon, it's the unknown. It's basic squealing which deafens those who arrive at its presence is an obvious way of it telling people to leave it alone, yet they go to Jupiter to see a larger version of it. This is when Hal sees problems with the bigger picture and the mutiny planned to disable him and he seeks revenge.David Bowman disconnects HAL and heads on alone through the an atmosphere of vivid colors, we see him as an old man, looking at himself as an older man. Perhaps trying to say 'what is the point in life'. Seeing yourself about to die, seeing yourself dying, see yourself older than you are and the emptiness you have when being alone. You live life knowing it will come to an end.The monolith symbolizes the things we search for our entire life, until our last breath we will question so many things, god, meaning of life, where our soul goes. The monolith represents that which we can never find.The movie ends with a baby, the forming of a baby and it looks like David Bowman. The true end, is perhaps the new beginning, Maybe our soul takes form in where we go and we start over somewhere else as a baby. Maybe we are reincarnated and take over life here as what will become someone else. Or perhaps neither, perhaps the new baby was symbolic of something completely different, someone completely new.. Either way it says that whatever we ponder, what ever mysteries we have we leave them in the end for someone else to start over and do it all again.This movie was beautiful, direction was great and these shots were breathtaking. The music was perfection and has became iconic, the actors did well and this movie is something great to watch and to think about. It is an obvious inspiration to hundreds of movies to follow from Star Wars to Alien and beyond. The technology was was beyond its time and set standards for thousands of films to come along.It is an art film, it is science fiction/drama. It has many long boring parts, but it's a must see film.. I can say if you are not a true lover of movies and one to respect and admire many aspects of film making then this may not be for you. I give it 6 out of 10 stars...truly delightful...I could talk about this movie for days. Its a perfect movie to watch and discuss with people.",6,1,6,17 April 2010
Avatar," Id rather watch The Smurfs
","In the future a planet is found that has valuable rock on it and the US gov. makes look-a-like versions of the people on that planet. The bodies are shallow and can only be controlled by human minds, so the people who control these avatars get put to sleep while their body gets sent out on this planet. One of the guys get lost on the planet, he mingles with them and even though the US soldiers think he is going in undercover to help them, in reality he is falling in love with the people there, especially the girl (who we'll call smurfette). Evetually the soldiers decide to go to war to get this rock thing they want and if you have watched more than 3 movies in your life you can pretty much figure what happens.BORING AS HELL! This movie was so slow and so god awful that I barely made it through. Its so full of C.G.I. that it's pathetic, I might've liked it had it been animated. I found the story very predictable and boring. There was nothing unique or new here. Movie fans are like the biggest idiots for rushing out and making films like this so big.Big Budget SUCKS. You see the guy in the wheelchair and you know he's gonna be the hero of the film. The stupid avatars looked horrible, I hated the way they looked. The music was so bad and this movie was so produced and full of gimmicks that it had absolutely no heart.I did like the symbolism of how if Americans want something they will get it and don't care who they have to kill to get it either. I hate those soldiers and this movie showed just how brainwashed and born to follow they are, nicely represented.James Cameron is a horrible director, does he even direct? I mean with all the C.G.I. and fake backgrounds and studio shots, what was there to direct. Beautiful colors and scenery but it wasn't real so I hated it. Acting wise I did think Sam Worthington did a good job, but little else. I have liked Sigourney Weaver at times, but here she is just basically being Ripley again. I like Giovani Ribisi but here he was like Jeremy Piven which is as bad as it gets. I also like Michele Rodriquez, but I am beginning to not like her..From Fast and Furious to Lost to Blue Crush she is EXACTLY the same in every movie.So if you are one of those people that love Hollywood hyped movies, love talentless directors and love movies because they have big budgets and no heart or nothing original then this is your film..I gave it 2/10 stars and not really sure why it got that high of a rating.",2,2,6,5 May 2010
Zombieland," Pretty good zombie comedy.
","So zombies have taken over the world and survivors are few and far between. A cautious college kid is on his way to Columbus, Ohio to see if his parents are dead. Soon he meets up with a Twinkie loving wild man headed to Tallahassee. They soon run into two girls who get the names Wichita and Little Rock. Between the four of them they have one wild adventure heading to various destinations and avoiding zombies, but having bloodbaths with them when they do see them.This is a movie I had wanted to see for some time, but honestly never expected much. Zombie movies is one of my favorite genres and when comedy is brought in to the mix it usually doesn't work well, but Shaun of the Dead really changed that up and made a great zombie film with comedy, not a comedy with zombies...and thats what this was, just a comedy with little actual zombie screen time. There was lots of blood and some gore and it was a fun feature for those who like gore.I did like it, but I didn't love it, it was missing real huge laughs and definitely missing the zombies. It was a fun film to set through and see and hear, but I think one time is enough.Ruben Fleisher did a great job directing this film and I give him props for such beautiful work. The kid 'columbus' had a list of zombie survival rules and it got annoying seeing them pop up so often, that was one of my major flaws... The film starts out with Metallica's For Whom The Bell Tolls as slow motion shots of zombies are shot, that was a beautiful open credits accompanied by great song.. The movie had many great songs making it a nice soundtrack too from Hank Williams to Velvet Underground to Willie Nelson to Raconteurs it had many good songs.Acting was great here too Woody Harrelson always does good and here its no exception. Jesse Eisenberg playing the lovable dork that he always does was good. Been a fan of Abigail Breslins since I first saw her so that was good. Not sure if I had seen Emma Stone before, but she did great here. Bill Murray playing himself was wonderful and I laughed the hardest at him, loved that whole part. Also a small part for Mike White was nice.The movie starts out with promise but goes downhill and the zombie action is never that good. It isn't hilarious and it is not a film I'd want to see again cause it offered very little - but I do suggest anyone who hasn't seen it and likes horror comedy should in fact watch it 5/10 stars.",5,1,3,16 May 2010
30 Days of Night," one of my favorite vampire movies
","I have never been a huge fan of vampire movies, most are too vanilla in the gore. I have liked a few throughout the years and wasn't expecting much with this one but it turned out to be a favorite of mine.In Alaska there is 30 days of darkness and in the town of Barow, many of the towns people flee and it is a small isolated and very dark place for 30 days. When a gang of vampires find this town they set out to kill people one by one.This film was shot in New Zealand, not Alaska and director David Slade did a wonderful job. I am not familiar with any of his work, except music videos and Hard Candy, all of which he did a great job on. Slade is currently working on the new Twilight:Eclipse movie. Sam Raimi was the first one on board to direct and I would've loved to see that, but he decided to just produce the film instead. David had some great shots and the sets were great, often using C.G.I. and lots of fake snow, but still did the job. Steve Niles wrote the story and shopped it around many times and got numerous doors slammed in his face at the movie studios. He eventually turned this into a comic book, then it was picked up for a movie. He had the screenplay written and not a whole lot was changed.Acting wise most were pretty good. Josh Hartnett is too young for me to take serious as a town sheriff, but he was okay. Ben foster is a perfect actor to me and always takes a part and becomes the guy he's playing. Mark Boone Junior is another guy who often plays a bad guy, or someone your not suppose to like character wise, and he amazes me.The vampires in this movie were absolutely perfect.. I loved the vampires, they were so pale, with jet black eyes, big teeth, and did these cool screams all of the time. The language they used was entirely made up for this film. These guys were cool vampires.I really liked this movie, it made my 3rd time watching it and I could watch it again and enjoy it..highly recommended.",7,0,1,8 April 2010
To Kill a Mockingbird," A must see movie for anyone.
","I am a movie buff, a movie lover to the fullest and I don't know why I had never watched this film. I watched it last night and it kept me hooked.I cant say anything great about it that hasn't been said but this drama had so much to offer.I honestly didn't even know the story, I thought it was about a black man being on trial for something he did to a white person and he was falsely accused. That is what the movie is about, but that is not the story the movie tells.I am all about hating racism and wanting the world to see the ugliness in judging people, this movie taught a lesson in that but I also admit I don't think you can tell someone that something is wrong without telling them why its wrong and what is right. This movie did a great job of showing so much about a man, about a human being and about how little we know about people. You cant know a man unless you've walked in his shoes.A movie with no horror, no violence, no romance, no big banner telling you what its about, but you walk away feeling that you understand it better than anything spelled out for you or explained to you. Its not deep its not complex or complicated, it is not simple or taken at face value either, it is just an emotion, an innocent look at something we never see in the people around us...the soul.The accused can be innocent yet be guilty of seeing himself through the eyes of his accuser and letting fear make him feel he is guilty. A child can be scared and yet brave because curiosity is stronger than fear. A shy man can be a hero and people can turn their backs on doing whats right in favor of doing whats expected.I cant talk about the movies plot without telling too much, I just tell people to watch it. The movie makes you want to like it. The characters are likable and you watch all that goes on and it just sucks you in. A drama with suspense and a touch of comedy and a lot of heart.The acting was perfect, those kids were just great and Peck was in this movie what every actor in Hollywood wishes they could be. The directing was so good the way it used the light to build up suspense and the way it took a movie made in the 60s and made it feel like it was made in the 30's. The music was great and it was just a wonderful experience.Boo Radley is one of the greatest characters ever in a film, I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know more about Boo and I was right there sneaking around and breathing hard with the kids, I was in this film feeling it, I was in the courtroom and in the woods and in the schoolyard...I liked this film a lot.I found a few little flaws in this film but thats always gonna happen and I know I shouldn't bring that up without explanation but I had to say it wasn't a perfect 10 to me but it was close.",9,1,2,21 December 2009
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," If you want honesty and not hype...read my comment
","This was in fact a good movie. I always knew it was a 'biggie' but had not gotten around to watching it. I actually watched about an hour of it and got bored and quit. A few hours later I was too lazy to put in another DVD so I watched the rest of it and it got much better.I don't think it deserves to be as highly ranked as it is, but it's fun none the less.The movie is pure drama with only a sprinkle of comedy and most of the advertising and promotions of the movie have presented it as comedy which is BS. I love a good drama, but I hate run on dialog and the movie had too much of that, but if you stick with it you realize it needs much of it to play out slowly for a character building.Jacky boy did good, but he was just a center piece for the other great actors to play off of. Everyone else is the star, and thats not an insult towards Jack, its true...his character is what puts the story and heart there for the other characters and allows them to open up.It's basically a story about a guy who gets put into a crazy house in order to get out of jail time and once there he realizes a lot about himself and about the human mind..how sane are we and is crazy always our fault or are we trapped inside of the worlds madness...I don't know how to say it, but thats why you watch the movie because it gets pretty deep.Again the acting is great, 35 years later and its still appealing and also its nice to see so many great stars in their early years, looking young and fresh. The direction didn't do much for me here...say what you will.. It was basic direction and the only key thing I enjoyed was letting the actors tell a characters story without dialog at times. The director had a lot of closeups spending quite some time focusing on just human emotions without words...sometimes thats deeper and more poignant than a page of brilliant lines..6 out of 10 stars because Its not perfect, it had a great story, but not a great hold.",6,2,7,20 December 2009
The Blind Side," good but not GREAT
","Based on real events this movie tells of a huge black teenage who is basically homeless and he's taken in by a rich white family who are obsessed with sports. This kid is good as sports, but doesn't really know how to play. They encourage him and help him learn football and his size soon makes him a superstar and the guy that all the major colleges want to draft. His poor background makes for his less than average grades in the classroom and the family also get him a tutor and help him with that as well. In the end it all works out and he becomes a legend in football.OK thats what the story is about, but it has many deeper meanings and touches on so many things. I kept hearing about this movie and just had to see it. It wasn't perfect but it was a nice moving story that showed the innocence of a young man and how he had been neglected and had a troubled youth, yet he didn't have any hate or animosity in his body. He was one to protect and although quite and reserved he was very full of love.My problems with this movie was race. I understand they had to show the ghetto and lay it on thick as to how his bad upbringing made him this way, but there should have been balance. His black neighborhood was filled with crack-heads and gangsters, but thats the only Africa Americans shown in this film. It was really sad that they shined such a negative shadow over the black community and made the white people out to be saints for saving this kid...I just would have loved some balance, even in the ghetto not all blacks are trash, so don't show it one sided.I don't like movies that have anything to do with sports either and this movie was football, football, football... I know it had to be, but I am only saying, it's one reason I can't love this film.The direction was okay but nothing too great, its funny this guy directed other sports film but I found his sports action scenes to be the worst direction of the film. Acting wise, I do not like Sandra Bullock, and by throwing on a bad southern accents and dying her hair blonde she ended up with so much praise...one of her better roles, but she still sucked, in fact she thought she was so bad she wanted to drop out and not ruin the movie...too late, the hero!!! Tim McGraw has no talent for anything so bad choice here with him. I love Kathy Bates, but even she did nothing for me. Quenton Aaron did great as Michael Oher and Jae Head did great as little S.J.It's a very moving film, but it wasn't great, it is an okay watch, but its just a movie and I would recommend it to drama lovers but not much else. 5/10 stars",5,2,3,2 May 2010
1408," creepy buildup that leads to nothing
","I am always eager to watch movies based on Stephen King's work, some are amazing but some are let downs. I think the story is important, but the screenplay and direction doesn't come across in the same chilling manner and it disappoints the viewer. I have not read the short story, but I do blame it on those factors.John Cusack plays a writer who goes all over visiting so-called haunted places so he can stay and write about them and let his viewers know that nothing has ever happened to him. When he is told to visit 1408 he doesn't pay it much attention. Samuel L. Jackson plays the hotel manager who begs him not to go there. The room is no longer in use, but writer Mike insists. Once there he quickly realizes the room is indeed no joke, and his night in 1408 is a living Hell.The directing wasn't very great, I think all of the shots of John entering the room and looking around the room should have been from his point of view, the fact we are often in the room looking out at him, takes a creepiness away from it. I think the ghosts are badly shown and there could've been some great chances to spook the audience but it wasn't done. Cusack and Jackson both did a great job in their parts, most of the other cast members had tiny roles, but all were okay.The movie goes by pretty fast and that was a good thing, I was never bored at any given time. There were too many things I didn't like, as I said above the p.o.v. angles should've been altered, the movie should've did scary set-ups to scare the viewer, esp. with the little girl. There were horrible scenes where John thinks he has gotten out and is with his wife only to find its a mind trick, I thought that whole section was taking so much away from the film.The film had a promising beginning and kept setting up for a scare, it just never happened.. not scary...avoid this movie if you wanna be scared or creeped out, but if you like psychological thrillers it might satisfy you.4/10 just because it does entertain to a degree.",4,1,2,16 April 2010
300," one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life!!!
","I hated this movie so bad I can't put it into words, I wanted to see a real movie about the infamous 300 Spartans, but this was just a piece of C.G.I. big budget garbage - pure Hollywood trash, with no heart, no style and no facts. TRASH!!!! So a stubborn man named Leonidas, in fear of his city being invaded by the Persian, takes 300 of his men out to kill as many as he can and will die before he returns. Okay that is stupid enough right there.. So yea he takes his measly army up against the thousands Xerxes puts against him and he kills hundreds, maybe thousand but yea he ultimately dies. The movie ends with the council finally (too late) sending out the Spartan army to aid up against the Persians, but the movie ends and oh well I could care less, I know the real history of what happened and this movie was as far away from the facts as anyone could dream of.I am not a fan of Zack Snider, he did a good job with Dawn of the Dead remake, but even that had too much of HIS style and he's not a director, he's a guy filming a bunch of films with a bunch of computer graphics and his editor does more work, his animation department does more work, his cinematographer does more work and oh yea his deep pocket producers dish it out and people call him a great director, hes not!!! First off this movie is far from factual. It is so made up and over the top that it is cheesy and stupid. I viewed it as complete fiction and therefore I hated the characters, if you're gonna fight a losing battle then you deserve to die, I swear to god I think republicans made this movie happen it seems like a fantasized George Bush dream... The movie is full of these creatures that never have walked on this Earth before and if so, I can assure you the Persians didn't know how to train them. This movie was so dumb and such things killed me, this is Persia, these are Iranians, this isn't middle Earth, could they have at least TRIED to make it seem real. The old priests living on the hill with an oracle - WTF - Why were they crazy about gold for, I didn't see a shopping mall up on the hill there with them.The movie was so big budget, yet it had a b-movie flow to it, the dialog was so stupid and this crazy narrator made me wanna strangle someone. The Spartans deserved to die if you ask me, they couldn't show love, they treated their children like crap and why would they wanna stay and protect that crummy place they lived. The Persians looked like they had fun and were living it up, put me with them any day of the week. These actors were horrible, more overacting than a movie I have seen since 1930. With their sprayed on abs and even cheekbones, reading the dumbest lines ever. The fake blood and the awful, awful, did I mention it was awful, slow motion fight scenes. Thats a directors way of cheating because he can't film it in actual time and get it done right. I mean 99 percent of this film was shot in a back lot and blue screens were used, so if you're gonna be that fake then do something flashy with all that money you're wasting.I hate this movie..I only watch it because its so great to watch it with people right before letting them watch Meet the Spartans which is a perfect parody. 1 star out of 10 and I wish I could go lower...I did love the color...to say something nice and Xerxes was cool..",1,1,6,13 April 2010
Aladdin," A boring kids movie that is overrated
","The daughter of the Sultan must get married soon and she won't pick any of the princes her dad is choosing for her. Meanwhile she sneaks out of the palace and falls for a peasant named Aladdin. Not long after that an evil man named Jafar disguised as an elder convinces Aladdin to do him a favor in return for riches. There is a secret dungeon where only a certain person may enter and inside Aladdin is sent to retrieve a lamp, but after getting the lamp he find the old man won't help him out of this cave and he is stuck inside with the lamp. Soon he find this lamp contains a genie who will grant him three wishes. He must now decide what he wants and what he needs to get him out of that cave, in the eyes and heart of princess Jasmine and in the honor of his new friend the genie.I have never cared much for this film, for Disney in general to be honest, at least not since the early 80's. I think Robin Williams was the only selling point for me, and he is rather annoying here, as he did most of his lines ad-libbed. I found the story to be rather boring as we'd all seen Aladdin in other movie versions throughout the years. Gilbert Gottfried is perhaps the most annoying human being alive and we have to put up with him here as the parrot.The movie is flawed through and through, I do like the color and production value and the fact they use c.g.i. and 3-d effects along with their standard animation. I hated the stupid songs, I hate corny songs in Disney films and could've appreciated the film had it not been so over the top and kid like. It could have aimed a bit at kids and adults alike and been more likable, but who am I kidding the movie was a huge success, it just isn't my thing...nice attempt, and good for kids I suppose.. 3/10 stars.",3,5,35,24 May 2010
