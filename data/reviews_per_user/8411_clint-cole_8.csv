Lucky Number Slevin," Predictably Unpredictable
","This movie did many things good, but failed to do one thing right. Many people compared this movie to 'Snatch' or 'Pulp Fiction', but it fails to compare to either of them. Both of those movies have twists, like this one does, but those twists are less predictable and more entertaining. Both of those movies followed different intersecting plot lines, but the lines were so vividly different that when they did intersect they had violent and entertaining reactions. Sleven had one plot line that jumped around a bit. I was expecting more. With every twist I was mildly amused but not fully entertained.This was worth the money, and worth the time. Considereing what was out in theaters at the time, it was the best choice.What I would have changed: Throw in Christopher Walken as one of the bosses, and a villain that isn't a pawn. Someone like Kevin Spacey would have done nicely. Cut Ben Kingsley and you've got a movie. Nothing against Kingsley. He just wasn't right there.I'm just glad it didn't have Ben Affleck or 50 Cent anywhere in it.",7,0,6,11 April 2006
Troy," Waste of potential
","Large budget, large actors, and a proved director. I would expect a 9 rated movie at the least. Taken at face value this is an exceptional movie, a 7. It's potential far surpassed its achievement. The scripted Orlando Bloom being a pansy to the shallow love affair by Brad Pitt. If only directors would see the obvious shortcomings of a film and change it into a great film. If you want to see a great war movie, this is it. Detailed battle scenes and elaborate props make for something you can really enjoy. This movie is like a boiled steak. It's still going to make for great eating, but in the end your going to be disappointed because you know what it could have been.",7,2,4,12 November 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," The Mutants Versus The Retards
","If by 'horror' you mean 'horrible' then that is the correct genre of this movie. I took a date to it because she likes horror movies and rarely gets the opportunity to enjoy one. We sat down and got ready for some entertainment.Instead, what was served to us was an eyesore of crap. Some movies rely on visual effects to stun their audiences. This movie was set in the desert, so there was no scenery change. The coolest effect I saw was someone on fire, and the fire was even questionable.I'm not finished ragging yet.... The movie took FOREVER to get going. I think it was trying to hold our suspense, but instead it just bored me. The first 30 minutes is the family gasing up and changing their oil. The writers could have easily circumvented this whole pointless scene of them gasing up and getting bad directions by having them get lost and break down.Also, I can understand the actors making clich√© mistakes for the forwarding of the plot in standard horror movies, but this movie was ridiculous. I found myself constantly asking WHY would anyone in their right mind do that. They were practically killing themselves.The freaks/zombies/whatever weren't scary. The special affects here included some 80s style horror flick face adhesives and some makeup. They weren't superhuman. They just seemed dumb and determined to rape/kill everyone. Given a 9mm with a full clip, a 5 year old could've taken them all down. I would've been more frightened of the radiation in the area making me sick than I would be from the mutants. Maybe next time have the radiation give them super abilities, like invisibility, so I don't have to see an abomination of make up artistry. And for god's sake, spend a little money on some up to date special effects.This crap chute of a movie gets 2/10, for wasting my time, being disgusting, making my date feel awkward about rape, charging me to much money, and embarrassing itself to the public.",2,1,4,22 March 2006
Pearl Harbor," Historical Atrocity
","There was quite simply only one thing wrong with this movie. The title. If this movie was called 'Attack on a base' or something it would've'e spared those of us with a sense of historical reverence associated with one of the only two times in the last century the United States was attacked on its own ground. The attack on Pearl Harbor, just like any significant military loss/victory or historical catastrophe (i.e. Napoleonic Wars, Holocaust, American Revolution), is served an insulting blow by having a cookie cutter Hollywood love triangle.Ben Afleck, you suck. Before this movie you were simply a bad actor whom I could overlook. But by taking this role you showed your ignorance and lack of talent.If you have no sense of history, and you like bad acting, then this movie is a gem and belongs right between 'you got served' and 'jingle all the way' in your DVD collection (you meat-head).",5,0,1,9 December 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Come again
","On second thought, please don't. This is a movie with three plots, all of which have the potential of going somewhere, but don't. The first plot: Discovery of something that causes a colony to lose contact with base. The second plot: A computer running a space ship decides to go homicidal. The third plot: On a mission to Saturn, an astronomer encounters a different dimension? This movie is supposed to be an artistic movie, but instead it becomes annoying when halfway through you have to listen to sustained and muffled breathing for an extended period of time during which the plot crawls forward at a snails pace. Toward the end there are flashing colors and irritating scrawling noises that are supposed to be special effects. For as much respect as I have for 'A Clockwork Orange', Stanley Kubrick fails to meet his own standards.",1,7,24,12 November 2005
Pulp Fiction," Edge-Of-Seat
","Not many movies would get a 10 out of 10 rating from me, but this one does. Not only does this movie keep you riveted on every plot twist, but this movie is a flagship for independent filmmakers everywhere. No movie since or before had the same dark comedy and attitude of this film. Tarentino had the tenacity to take actors and actresses and provoke the kind of performance necessary to bring them to their prime. Every scene is directed to perfection, leaving you stunned by the turn of events. While watching, I suggest looking for specific lags in the dialog and plot. When you think you recognize one, where nothing is happening, grab onto something and brace yourself because the movie is about to take a wild swing into action. This movie is a must see for all adult audiences.",10,0,2,12 November 2005
Mystic River," Visual Gag Reflex
","Let me nutshell the movie for you: A little boy gets raped. The little boy grows up. A teenage daughter of a mob boss gets murdered. Then the little boy, all grown up gets murdered by the mob boss. Then the mob boss finds out he was wrong in murdering the guy, moves on. A cop also knows about the whole incident, but decides to overlook it since they were all friends.While this same plot if directed properly could have ended up as a fabulous movie with elements of irony and dark humor, Clint Eastwood fails to capture anything but disgusting acts of pointless violence.I took a date to see this movie in theaters and haven't been that disgusted and embarrassed in a long time.",1,41,59,12 November 2005
Beetlejuice," Nice FU#KN' Model!!!!
","This is by far Michael Keaton's best performance. Every time he comes on the screen he displays such an eccentric performance that it rivals Jim Carrey from 'The Mask', only without as much help from computers. If his role calls for gross he brings revolting; pushy he brings offensive; witty he brings hilarious sarcasm. One of my few complaints is that he doesn't get enough screen time, although he does have a large portion of it, most goes to Gena Davis and Alec Baldwin.Tim Burton's directing is great. My favorite scene by far doesn't even have Michael Keaton in it. Anyone who has seen this will remember it as the dancing dinner scene.This is a classic. If you haven't seen it then you must've'e grown up under a rock or born before I was.",7,3,5,9 December 2005
