Blade Runner 2049," this is the WORST movie I have watched in the last 5 years!
",I signed up to this very enjoyable site just to be able to rate this movie. You must have to have super intelligence or something as the story was so boring and mostly hard to follow with no action whatsoever. How this movie got such a high rating overall I' would never know'. I never seen the first Bladerunner movie so maybe you would have to have done that to rate this better than 1/10. Just be warned you will either love this movie or absolutely hate it.,1,13,27,13 October 2017
