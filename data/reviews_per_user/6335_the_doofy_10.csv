Lucky Number Slevin," Ruined by the feel good ending
",A movie friend and I agree that this movie missed on being a classic in its ending. I've always wondered if they did an Alpha group testing and let the audience decide on how the movie closes out.Timeless classics have a tendency to leave an audience uncomfortable and unfulfilled. This is not one of those. The same kind of thing was done with the modern -war of the worlds-.Neither of these movies are something a viewer will come back to or remember,2,2,6,31 July 2018
The Hateful Eight," Nothing very original, seems to have a private agenda to it
","I actually only made it through the first half of the movie. Samuels Jackson's character is called Nigeria so many times by all the other characters, it had me wondering what the real purpose to the movie was. I just lost interest at some point. I've had the same experience with movies that use the F word a few hundred times.Having worked in Watts of Los Angeles for 10 years I can honestly say I never heard a Caucasian use this word against an African American to his / her face. Although I've heard it a LOT being used from one African American to another, usually in playful banter. Many times during a day.It seemed like Tarantino's whole point to the movie was the degradation of the African American, which I found repulsive and not fitting the facts of our modern world, based on my real life exposure to working with and around a mix of Caucasians and African Americans. I realize that African Americans were probably not treated well back in western times, but it seemed to be very overboard, and felt like it was trying to make a modern point.A lot of what Tarantino has done in past movies was used in this movie, I guess he was so anxious to push his private agenda that it blinded him to being creative. Unless he has lost his touch, which often occurs with movie guru's.I also felt that some of the actors were wrong for their parts, things for some of the characters just didn't feel real, lines were spoken as if read off of a billboard out of sight of the camera. I think Tarantino was more fixated on getting names to raise ticket sales, then on focusing on creating something people will want to re watch in a year.",1,134,287,25 December 2015
Doctor Strange," True to the Dr. Strange comics
","I am going to put this in as a last minute thought, the Dr. Strange animated movie that came out awhile back is a much better scripted and thought out movie than this, so if U find this movie frustrating in its lack of sense and incompleteness, watch the animated movie.Having read a few Strange comics growing up i can attest that this movie was true to the strange world, where nothing is really explained very well, Dr. Strange seems to have powers equal to a God, and his movements are basically rabbits pulled from a hat --I never really found the strange comics to have much depth, so the movie was pretty true to the original strange vision --Currently this movie is overrated, and probably will remain so for quite awhile, the script simply isn't in the same class as the other marvel super hero movies that have come out in the past few years, a discerning viewer can see the hand of Disney raise its ugly head in this. --Its obvious that some of actors portraying main characters were not required to audition or 'win' their parts, I give the overall acting about a B- to B range",5,3,5,1 February 2017
The Revenant," Standard Hollywood script format, and what real story?
","The upsides to revenant --Lots of gritty action --Decent special effects --Good acting --Good cinematography --Good costumes--Downside, the entire script is based on knowing an audience's attention span is 15 minutes, make the story mesh for 15 minutes, and then you can start over from scratch, as long as you keep them engrossed in the action--The Pawnee, a Midwest tribe in Nebraska, ending up in the mountain ranges of British Columbia is ridiculous. --The French traders are making a living trading fur with the Indians, but they kidnap a Pawnee Indian girl from one of the tribes they trade with and serial rape her, and kill a stray Pawnee Indian they come across (the french can verbally communicate with the Pawnee) and hang a sign on his body written in french (the Pawnee speak french), the whole thing was done to create an additional antagonist, Hollywood style. The reality is, people (even evil French), would never jeopardize their business and lives in this fashion. --Our protagonist gets cold and manages to generate a fire with a flint and black powder, all well and good. THEN our protagonist is caught up in a river that is below freezing, he goes over waterfalls, through raging rapids, finds a tree piece to cling to and after several more minutes lands safely on land. The life expectancy for someone with a ravaged sickly body in such water is under 15 minutes. Our hero climbs onto shore, the camera pans somewhere else, and comes back to out hero with a blazing fire. EVEN if the guy still had some black powder (which he doesn't, he left it behind), it would never be able to start a fire with wet powder.--Our hero comes upon the French and sorta saves the Pawnee Indian girl (in British Columbia), and takes a good ole black powder pistol, maybe its a flintlock, maybe. In any event, he takes the pistol, and some how manages to get off 3-4 shots with that one shot pistol, taking down Bad guys while riding a horse. Then later he gets set upon by a pack of Indians, and gets off a few more shots, taking out Indians while riding horse back, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the SEMI AUTOMATIC black powder pistol(Glass was bear mauled in the 1820s, so it was a semi automatic cap and ball pistol folks).--Now we come to the climax. The bad guy runs off with the company money and two guys go after him. This is WITH the knowledge that the guy has taken everyone's pay, is heavily armed and the country side is crawling with misplaced enraged Pawnee tribes. TWO guys go out to get the baddee. Not likely, in reality the fort would have sent as many people as it could spare.I'm not going to bother to elaborate about the real facts of the Glass bear attack; that there was no revenge factor after Glass was mauled by a bear. He had no children. That he was in fact mauled during summer. That the colleagues of Glass killed the she bear and nursed Glass back to health, somewhere in the sunny midwest (not BC in the winter). Finally, the movie does not say at the end that no animals were brought to harm, I know they used puppets and special effects in some cases for the animals, but if in fact animals were not brought to harm in the making of this movie, it WOULD say so in the credits. -IE, animals were killed in the making of this movie",2,46,92,21 December 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Hi Folks
","The rating on this movie is incorrectThe actual rating is -Action, Adventure, Fantasy, ComedyMy wife and I very much enjoyed this movie, which is saying something since she is conservative when it comes to body count moviesClean movie outside of action sequences, no promotion of foul language, no promotion of drugs, no real exploitation stuff, very enjoyableIt turns out we don't need bloom or knightly for a great POTC movie after all, I can't believe how much i laughed at the guillotine action scene---Oh no, Jack's head is going to be cut off, oh wait I guess not,--Oh no it is going to be cut off, oh hold on, I guess not, etc=hilarious and very originalThe running gag of the donkey being needed for sailing navigation had me chuckling on and off'I think U should know, she's a horologist'Very original humor throughout movie, WATCH IT",8,4,7,19 September 2017
Singin' in the Rain," Singing in the rain is a Farce
","The whole premise of this movie is to give credit to people like Marni Nixon and others who were never listed in the credits for the great movies they dubbed--You are NOT hearing the voice of Debbie Reynolds in these songs, her voice was dubbed --Sometimes the very woman who she was supposed to be dubbing was in fact dubbing her--The movie was over hyped and what was actually occurring was kept very hush hush when it came out for viewing==Debbie Reynolds' voice was dubbed by Betty Royce for the scenes where Reynolds' character dubs Lina Lamont's singing and speaking voice. And in one scene were Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) is dubbing Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), Hagen is actually dubbing Reynolds dubbing Hagen on screen for just one line.==",1,6,16,1 February 2017
War of the Worlds," Hollywood ending take it to mediocre
","The predictable feel good Hollywood ending took this movie from an all time classic to a standard night out on the town with the family --Its not a movie you go back to for a watch --I've seen more than one movie completely destroyed by the ending, and this is one of those --I know for a fact that the ending to movies are often changed for the USA viewing audience, I also know that there have been times when a foreign group has been up for an academy award and made it known they would not attend IF the ending to the movie was changed for the USA viewing audience --Anyway, I needed more words so i thought to thrown that last paragraph in",4,5,8,31 March 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Excellent monster movie
","I watched this wanting a monster movie, and monster movie i gotDespite whatever the naysayers are posting, this movie will be around for a very long time. Its much better than the peter jackson thing that ends up smothering U out with his action scenes (the three T rexes thing that goes on and on was just too much). The action in this movie was done with some thoughtThis movie reminds me of some other movies that initially take a hit and then slowly rise up to be an icon.One of the better monster features U can eat popcorn to. Some of the actors were not very good, but that would be my only complaint about this",9,4,8,22 May 2017
Annihilation," Typical hollywood movie
","A 25 year old actress / protagonist, who has served 7 years in the army, AND has a PhD in Biology (8 years minimum), as well as being a professor/associate professor at some unspecified university, and who has also been missing her husband for one year--all at 25--The rest of it I could get as far as the message (s), but at the end the real message is another hollywood movie setting Unobtainable standards/Bars for people, especially our young people",1,17,32,27 March 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," I wish I could give this movie at least an average rating
","but alas I've been cursed with an IQ that is apparently at a level that gets offended when a conglomerate with an IQ around 40 write a script and expect me to go along with it.--I don't even know where to start. Lets see, if you drive for 180 days and average a speed of even 17 miles an hr, you would go around the circumference of the earth three times. Or 53 miles an hour for 8 hrs each day. So the whole premise of the movie plot is null and void right there. --In this futuristic world there is no water and no rain, but apparently our group of antagonists have copious amounts of water bestowed on them from on high, or rather from the movie makers. If we see it then it must be, so saith the movie makers. The the location of their limitless reservoir is just plain physically impossible, --I needed a reason for that much man power and mechanized weaponry not being able to stop a single semi, and I was never given one, just lots of eye candy. I needed to know how so many people could live and survive when there were no plants and no water. I need to know how so many vehicles could have unlimited gasoline and be in top running order under these conditions. --But all I got were more explosions. -- I wanted a well written script, instead of two hrs of explosions--at the end of the day I guess explosions are a lot lot cheaper and easier than a well written script coming out of Hollywood.",1,34,69,20 July 2015
