The Avengers," Great!
","The Avengers is a dream movie come true for superhero fans with its group of extremely talented actors and epic champions, to create an action- packed movie with hilarious banter laced in between scenes. I love how each of the actors and actresses has portrayed each of the roles they were given.",9,0,0,6 November 2019
Spider-Man 2," Why is this so low?
","So many Spiderman movies out there but this will always be the original. Though the other ones have better CGI and maybe action sequences, none can match the plot this one has.",10,0,0,6 November 2019
Spider-Man 3," Not a bad movie at all
","This movie is about Spidey's revenge and transformation to bad Spidey. It has a dark feel to it that I found one of the most appealing factors to this movie. Because we've all gotten used to Peter Parker being 'your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,' having him turn to the dark side for some time and watch him get out of it was a whole new experience.",8,1,1,6 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Oh well
",Too bad. I loved the first two Thor movies and was expecting that the third one will hold up to the quality of the first two. But I guess today it's really hard to pull off a trilogy that'll ring throughout the years like how the Wachowskis did with the Matrix.,7,0,0,6 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Surprised I liked it as much as I did
","Stan Lee would be proud! Great story, great message, and great animation.",9,0,0,6 November 2019
Spider-Man," Best SPIDER-MAN!
",Sony did a great job of focusing on what really matters in this movie - the character. Here we see a relatable Peter Parker who can't seem to catch a break and when he does it just feels so satisfying to watch him rise up from all the challenges he faced.,10,0,0,6 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Great!
","The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren't enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers. I did know that there was gonna be some time travel involved, but the way Marvel explained and executed it didn't too well for me. They can't get away with just putting it all in 'Quantum.'",10,2,3,6 November 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Awesome movie still
","Movie was great but felt like there was just too much action and fighting. The creativity of the choreography gets lost in the whirlwind of action and this I noticed most in Captain America's scenes. He does like a hundred different awesome things with his shield, but you don't have time to really take it in because you're already looking at Iron Man blasting 20 Ultron-bots to bits.",9,0,0,6 November 2019
Thor," Nice Chris Hemsworth!
","I haven't seen Chris Hemsworth act in any other film and this is the first time I've seen him in action, but I gotta say he really did justice to this role. Big thumbs up to Marvel for doing a great job on this casting!",9,0,0,6 November 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Honestly loved it
","I don't understand all the hate surrounding this movie. I loved every bit of it and somehow, to me, it feels like this was even better than its predecessor. Better CGI, a darker, sci-fi fantasy plot and improved action sequences make it a truly great sequel to the first film.",9,0,0,6 November 2019
