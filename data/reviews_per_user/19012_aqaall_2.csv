It," Jumpscares kept me awake
","This movie was absolutely boring. Scary things wasn't scary at all - sometimes disgusting, sometimes hilarious - there were 'scary' scenes during which whole audience bursted with laughter. Jumpscares were the only things that kept me awake in theater (because of loud noises, not because they were scary). The only good thing about this film was acting - these kids were brilliant. Wasted time, wasted money. Should have watched Apple Keynote instead.",3,11,22,12 September 2017
Baby Driver," One massive cringe
","This movie was so bad I can't even finish a review because thinking of it makes me disgusted. I'm so glad I waited for DVD release rather than going to the theatre. I'd give it 5 for acting, music and overall execution, but everything else is just awful. I honestly regret watching it.",5,7,15,5 November 2017
