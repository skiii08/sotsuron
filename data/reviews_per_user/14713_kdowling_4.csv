Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," a A depressing indication that we really have become a hateful society.
","The real joke is audience reaction to this 84 minute ethnic joke. I am not certain if this is was intended, but this movie demonstrates that we really have not progressed beyond the < Polish, Irish, Jewish, Italian, ETC., > joke. The humor of the movie is really low and basically a continuous barrage of cheap humor.It is really pathetic that people still waste their time and money on this crap, but it seems that excrement, nudity, broken English and ethnic slurs are still funny to adults.While others may hail this as a great picture, I just find it a depressing indication that we really have become a hateful society that demeans anyone that is different.",1,50,104,13 November 2006
Spirited Away," Great Film: No distribution: Disney wins Dopey Award
","'Spirited Away' is one of the best fables filmed.  Audiences seem to know this, yet Disney has neither advertised it nor made a serious effort to distribute it in the United States.  This lack of effort merely encourages comparison of this work to other Disney offerings.  The last film that Disney did of this calibre is Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937). Atlantis may have come close, but Spirited Away puts it and other Disney efforts of the last sixty years to shame.  It has a good story line grounded in some very important ideas.  It is a classic fable and hard to believe it is all from the mind of a 20th century writer, Hayao Miyazaki.  I look forward to his future efforts: they will be worthwhile.It is worth a long drive to see Spirited Away.",9,0,1,6 December 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," Staggeringly Real
","This anime is one of the greatest films ever made.  It could easily be ranked with films like 'Broken Blossoms' by D.W. Griffith (1919). It is a classic tragic play.  One not only sympathizes with the characters, but through the skill of all involved in making this work, one identifies with them.   Their misfortune becomes your misfortune.  It is your misfortune, for as the film points out:  nations that are enamored of their destiny do not care about people, especially those too young or too weak to fight.  The consequences of their do not fall on those responsible, but upon the innocents, the children.It is also a film about the unconquerable nature of the innocent spirit: the downtrodden children are more alive than those who are not starving. They experience life, they do not merely pass through it. Even in their misfortune, their destiny is eternal.Do not pass this film by.  See it and think about its message.",10,0,1,23 November 2002
The Red Violin," The Best Film of 1998
","This is not a light-weight, commercial or formula, film.  It is a brave journey into the human soul. The 'damsel in distress' is an inanimate object, the Red Violin. It evokes varied, sometimes profound, emotional reactions from all who see it for what it is. There are many fine performances, especially by Samuel L. Jackson. Excellent direction.",10,0,0,4 October 2001
