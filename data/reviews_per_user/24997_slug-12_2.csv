The Blair Witch Project," The Finest Horror Film To Date!
","I call this the finest horror film to date as a way of respecting the sheer genius of the filmmaking.  Not relying on the typical horror scare tactics, director Dan Myrick and Eduard Sanchez have not only created an amazing psychological terror, but a complex character on the deterioration of three regular people.  The situations called for the same reactions the characters gave; a feat seldom accomplished in the sometimes phony, sometimes mesmerizing word of Hollywood realism.  This is my favorite American film of the year, thus far.  A terrific movie!",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
The Princess Bride," Perfection!
","Brilliant from star to finish, Rob Reiner's 'The Princess Bride' is the ultimate in screen fantasy.  Featuring some absolutely mesmerizing performances, especially from Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes and with some wonderful comedy thrown in (Billy Crystal and Carol Kane are the most hilarious screen couple in years!), Reiner has created a masterpiece of adventure, camraderie, and true love.  Grade: A+",Null,1,2,10 August 1999
