Blade Runner 2049," Excellent story, visuals, acting, sound design and acting.
","What can I say; the movie was excellent. Incredibly well done visual and sound design, backed with good acting and an interesting yet 'familiar' tale of humanity; classic good versus evil, with a distinctly dark view of humanity. To me it speaks most clearly as a warning of a potentially dangerous path to the future, led through technology, with the idea of man playing God in an age where our values have been led astray.Not sure if that made sense, but what the hell... great movie!",10,2,10,13 October 2017
