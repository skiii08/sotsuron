The Blair Witch Project," Fear of The Unknown!!
","Simply put, 'The Blair Witch Project' will scare you with what it doesn't do. No special effects, No blood and gore, No actual creature or strange being to jump at you on screen, just plain old fashion fear of the unknown!! A very simple movie by today's 'Star Wars' Standard, 'The Blair Witch Project' is actual footage from three film students(Heather Donahue,Michael C.Williams and Joshua Leonard).The film and video tapes where found in 1995 during an archaeologist dig in the area by students from the University of Maryland, a year after the disappearance of the three students in 1994, in the very same woods were the filming of the documentary took place. The three had gone into the woods near Burkittseville, Maryland to do a documentary on a local Legend of The Blair Witch, never to be found again. The film is not of the best quality and there are a lot of scenes where you see nothing at all(but hear the students talking and the fear that surrounds and is coming from them),but what makes this movie great is the unknown. Know one knows what ever happened to the three students and all we have left is their film. You never actually see 'The Blair Witch' in the documentary, but it is those things that happen to the three of them combined with the fear of the unknown that make this movie terrifying. Some would say its a hoax, I say open up your mind and be prepared to be scared!!",9,4,7,8 August 1999
