The Devil's Advocate," Awful
","One actor can act, the other can not.  You guess which!  One guy give a performance of 8 and the other a 4.  The script is a 4 and I give this movie a 4.  I never heard a worse southern Florida accent ever.  This film ends so stupid.  The Devil must of made this film to torment people. 4/10",4,5,12,29 July 2002
Ford v Ferrari," A must watch of the 2019 movie year.
","A must watch of the 2019 movie year. What works for Ford vs Ferrari takes us to the World War 2 generation. In Ford vs Ferrari, we see a world of Alpha males who spar off in the corporate world and race track. Ford is belittled by Mr Ferrari and the Ford vs Ferrari feud begins. We see a corporate world of sharks with harsh words and a struggle to survive. On the race track, there is Damon (Shelby) and Bale (Miles) two alpha males who get into a fight but still are friends. Miles' Wife explains to Miles in one line: you survived W W 2 in a tank on D day all the way to the end of the war, after that experience nothing else scares Miles. Driving 220 miles was nothing, but an adrenaline rush. Shelby bet his company so Miles can drive. Era of risk takers with dirty tricks on the race track, mixed with guts and determination.
Ford vs Ferrari is a movie about a generation who pushed, and risked at a different time before safe spaces and the twitter mob. 8 stars.",8,1,2,4 December 2019
The Blair Witch Project," bad
","Over rated, if you expect a scare this movie will bore you instead.  The movie is to bouncy, and will give you a headache.  I hope Hollywood will not copy this format and make more cheapo's like this.  When I spend 8.50 I would like to see a movie that doesn't look like my neighbour made it.",1,1,4,26 September 1999
Insidious: Chapter 2," Insidious Chapter 2 pulls it off!
","Insidious: Chapter 2 pulls it off. Going into the movie theatre, I thought Insidious 2 was going be either awful or really good! Part 2 movies tend to be one extreme or the other in quality. Insidious 2 was well acted and directed. Wilson has another strong role, but Wilson was a supporting role in part 2. Wan's directing is a slow burn style horror movie. Wan's story starts off where Insidious left the viewer hanging. There is a movie flash back which creates the mystery of why the bad events happened? Regrettably, the story becomes bogged down with typical scares, and becomes just another horror movie! Thankfully, the last third of Chapter 2 picks up. The last third of Insidious 2 melds the first movie and the second installment into the story's conclusion. A memorable and exciting 20 minutes save Insidious 2. Eight out of ten!",8,1,3,15 September 2013
Moneyball," I really liked this movie!
","I use to watch baseball! I liked watching baseball, but became tired of watching the Yankees winning over and over again. The Jays etc became feeder teams for the richer teams. 'Moneyball' addresses the free agency issue of how does a poor team compete with the Yankees. After the A's lose to the Yankees, Pitt's character Billy Beane asks how can the A's compete. The part of the movie I like is Billy keeps asking why? The scouts have no answers. Billy knows, as a manager, he needs to recruit players a different way. Billy needs to replace three top players, and runs across this accounting type guy from the Cleveland Indians and implements money ball. A great theory. One recruits less quality players, which cost less to pay, who get on base often, and score. The team might have more errors, and their mistakes will cause runs. These same players will create more even greater amount of runs and win the game. The best part of the movie is with such a radical idea, Billy faces much opposition from the establishment. People in control hate new ideas. People get fired, they trade players,(my favorite part) Billy trades and demotes a huge chunk of the team to force the coach to play his players and system. The movie shows Billy as a maverick, a 3 D thinker, straight shooter, tests people, who loves the game. Loves it so much that he stays in Oakland, which show Billy's character. The movie was a joy to watch.",Null,1,2,27 September 2011
The Avengers," Routine script, but still a good movie
","The Avengers is okay. The movie has some weak points and strong points. The strong points out weight the weak points. The Avengers weak points are the script and special effects. The Avengers follow a predictable formula. The comic book hero scripts are redundantly formulated where a problem is created and then there is a final action showdown between good and evil. The viewers then experience the same seen it and done it before special effects. What make 'The Avengers' stand out from other comic book movies is the character development. The Stark, and Hulk characters save 'The avengers'! Stark and Hulk create comic relief and interesting dialogue. When the Stark and Hulk disagree with the other super heroes their wit is hilarious. I give Avenger six out of ten.",6,5,13,16 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," 6 or 7 out of 10
","A six or seven out of ten. Not a bad movie. The movie is geared for family entertainment. Well directed and acted. Cage is out to protect his family Honor and the honor of his great granddad. A quick pace, with great stunts and sets IE Mount Rushmore. The presidents desk, and the Queens desks were great scenes. I will not ruin anymore, for the movie involves the president, and book. Worth dinner and a movie. 7 out of 10. Edd Harris has a good performance. Harris seems to play the roles of a heavy. Watch this movie in the theartier. Rent the movie instead of buying it. On rental night one needs a big screen to watch this film.",7,1,3,7 January 2008
Blade Runner 2049," Much better than the predecessor!
","Much better than the predecessor! I remember in 82 seeing the original Blade Runner which had mixed reviews. Years later, Blade Runner became a cult classic. The original Blade Runner is a better movie after several viewings, because Blade Runner is a multi- layered story. So many layers of stories I had to write a paper on the 82 Blade Runner for my university course. The 82 Blade Runner's many layers created many questions which 2049 tries to answer. Artificial intelligence, memories, self awareness, are topics breached. What worked the background, sets, lighting with the themes of a over populated multi racial future L A of a decaying over stretched, and stressed environment honors the concepts of the original film. The supporting characters back the environment of a world on the brink. (Robin Wright) Lieutenant Joshi wanted to stop a replicate revolt. (Jared Leto) Niander Wallace creating a society which survives on replicate slave labor. The protagonist Ryan Gosling, k character, creates a better version of the Harrison Ford Decker Blade Runner character. The lonely life K, only companion is an artificial computer companion. The computer companion creates more questions of self awareness with artificial intelligence. The K character who is a slave to genetic programming forces K to go on a detective story. A compelling detective story which several layers unravel each segment at a time. Regrettably, 2049's ending creates even more questions then answers. Is Decker a replicant? Was Decker a plant?

Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Best to rent Vol 1 and 2 and watch it together!
","Volume 2 like Volume 1 is lacking, and the story misses that special sauce. This movie in reality is 1 cut into 2, thus watching 1 leaves the story lacking, and too silly, and watching 2 the movie is serious, but lacks depth, because the viewer loses continuity and background from the 1.   If I watch the 2 films together, the movie would be a 7 or 8, but separate the viewer loses the film's rhythm, making the film awkward, giving the film a less deserving 6.  Kill Bill is outlandish  and entertaining enough to compare with Dusk til Dawn.  Rent the two films together and watch them one after the other so that the story makes sense.  I would not have minded if the movie was long at the theatre, they could of just had an intermission. For example, Scarface and the Godfather had intermissions.  I hope the studio did not cut this movie in 2 for revenue reasons.  Imagine how awful the Godfather or Scarface movie experience would of been if the audience had to wait 3 months to see what happened after Sonny got killed or Tony got arrested for washing money.  6 out of 10 possible 7 or 8 if the 2 volumes were watched together.",6,0,1,2 May 2004
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not bad, but expecting more!
","Not bad, but expecting more. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 was well written, directed and acted. The story unfolded well, and was choreographed perfectly. The actors performed their characters perfectly with the exception of Moore. There was no chemistry with her leadership speeches, unless Moore's speech style is tactical done to create a certain image. The problems with Mockingjay - Part 1 is the movie slowly builds up. The entire Part 1 is build up with no release. Leaves the viewer frustrated. The viewer ends up experiencing only half the story. The reasons for the above mentioned problems is the final book was incredible long and would translate into two films. Still enjoyable, but frustrating. I give Mockingjay/Part 1 seven stars out of ten.",7,8,25,22 November 2014
The Legend of Bagger Vance," A surprising!
","A great film. The idea of Will Smith and Matt Damon golfing together sounds more like an awful comedy. Caddy Shack 3 crosses my mind lol! The Legend of Bagger Vance is a great film on several fronts. The characters are well developed. Will Smith plays an honest/mysterious character. Matt Damon's excellent performance of a man with many inner demons, who hides from others. The other supporting characters around the golf community build on the story and create a positive spirit towards the story's climax of the golf tournament. The director blends an entertaining story with social messages. Can Damon win the golf tournament, and inspire people? Sportsmanship, professionalism, doing the right thing, and having ethics is spun as the characters develop. The Legend of Bagger Vance explains the mystery of the Will Smith's character. Inspiring, and entertaining. I give The Legend of Bagger Vance a par 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,10 November 2014
Vertigo," Doesn't age well
","This film is well acted, and the scene come off as real.  Especially James Stewart's anxiety of heights, but and there is a but here, the film shows its age.  Much of the film came across as cheesie or cornballish. Awkward or abrupt would be a better description.  The script becomes a bit stupid in spots, but a ground breaking movie fore its time.  Not one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films. 4/10",4,7,22,23 September 2002
Scarface," Ok Miami Vice before Miami Vice
","Long films usually bore me, this is an exception.  Yes a few parts could be cut out, but the length is there to tell the full story.  It has a 80's Miami Vice rock videoish style of music with the story.  Al does a great role along with Steve and the strong supporting cast backs ups the lead actors.  The intention of the director is to show a violent, gritty, and corrupt film; this perfectly reflects the drug world and the people who associate with it.  The ending is a bit lame, but the film wants a impressionable ending.",7,0,1,28 February 2001
Frost_Nixon," Why do this film?
","Why do this film? I watched this film on the History network, and found it entertaining. The actor who played the former president did and outstanding job. The interview shows the will of words between politicians and the media. In the end, I could not understand the big deal over the interview. Everyone, knew Nixon was involved in the Watergate cover up. Nixon was not going to throw his buddies under the bus. Nixon's political enemies, and others forced Nixon to resign. Nixon was finished, proving anymore about Watergate is like kicking a dead foe. I did not see the big deal. Maybe, Nixon wanted to say what and that is why he agreed to the interview. The ending was sort of anti-climatic. It made one fill more sorry for Nixon then to prove what everyone already knew. This film reminds me of the Trumph/Obama birth certificate issue, which the public already new the answer and it was a lot to do about nothing.",6,0,1,13 May 2011
Alien 3," This film kills the other 2
","What is worst than Alien 3 is Alien 4, they ran with the money on this one; by using the name of a successful film series they suckered people into rent this one.  Low budget, but directed well considering the poor script, this film should be on late night at least it can compete with the infomericals.",4,0,2,7 January 2002
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Not as good as the first one!
","I believe the first Sherlock Holmes was much closer to the books formula of mystery solved by Holmes logic. The second installment is more like an action film. There is more action in this movie, but the movie still goes back the original formula when Holmes locks his wits/logic against the evil professor. The movie is a good mix of humor and action while the storyline keeps the viewer interested. Guy Richie directs the slow motion action excellently, which Richie is famously known for. The movie is worth seeing in the theater. It was a good New Years eve date. I give Sherlock Holmes A game of Shadows a seven out of ten.",7,5,8,2 January 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Different with out Eric but Norton is a great replacement.
","The Hulk is a well directed, and crafted movie. The back in time, and present time filming creates a great mise en scene! The continuity of the directing creates a great pace where the viewer is enthralled with the story. Eric Bana did the last film and Norton had big shoes to fill. Norton especially with the beginning scene of hiding in Brazil, plays the on the run Bruce Banner character excellently. The ending is great, I was shocked. William Hurt plays a good bad guy again. I will not ruin the ending, but will give a hint. There is a clue to the ending at the beginning of the movie. Two merged into one is all is my hint. 8/10 green monsters",8,2,4,29 June 2008
Miracle," Great movie!
","I stopped myself from chanting USA USA in the theater, because my wife would have left, but I still got emotional and raised my hands up when the US scored.  I still miss the Jets leaving the Peg, and still have the game reflexes when I watched the movie with a hockey crowd.  I remember watching most of the games when I was eleven.  Everyone hated the big Red machine from the Soviet Union, that killed the NHL all stars, and team USA afterward in a pre-Olympic game.  Part of the cold war fever taking place and this movie showed the importance of the game back in 1980. I was chanting USA USA while watching the game, live at home and remember Craig with the flag, all the players standing on the podium during the medal ceremony.  This must of had a huge influence on Hockey in the USA, and turned a lot of youngsters onto the game!  Being a hockey nut I remember watching the US during the 80's and they would lose in the first round at the Canada cups but with the younger players coming up they got better in every tournament, and finally made the cup final in 1992.  This event and the infusion of Canadian junior hockey coaches into their college system makes the US, the hockey power it is today.  Is is no longer just Canada and the Russians, I figure there will be many Canada, USA olympic gold medal games with maybe a movie about it one day.  Great hockey movie the advisors made the goaltending, and puck movement so real.  Russell looks and acts like a coach, from the coaching view, not the fan.  Brooks later became the coach of the Rangers, it was classy of them showing his picture at the end of the movie. 7 out of 10",7,3,4,7 February 2004
Mission: Impossible III," The movies improve over time
","The Mission Impossible movies improve over time. If one watches the first compared to the others one can notice the gradual improvement in the film series. MI3 did not work in two ways. The ending with the two bosses who was the real traitor, I was confused with the video replay, the movie never explains the plot twist. Too many different, characters, I found slows down the film's development. MI3 works in 3 others ways. The character of Ethan Hunt develops more and the viewer finds out that Hunt is a loyal,compassionate man who never quits. The fast pace is a credit for the director who generates the film's intensity. The stunts were better and more entertaining if one watches the other to MIs. A decent summer flick. A rebound for Cruise after War of the Worlds. Definitely rent. 7 out of 10",7,0,1,27 June 2006
Captain Phillips," Best movie of the year! So Far!
","Captain Phillips is the best movie of the year! Or so far this year! What I liked about Captain Phillips is a great mix of story, strong acting and solid movie directing. Captain Phillips has a great real life story of Somali Pirates who take over a ship. There is character development and a great pace in the story. I am sure there is over exaggerations, and omissions for drama and time constraints reasons. What inhibits Captain Phillips' story is the strong acting by Tom hanks. Hank's performance creates an emotional spectrum of stress and release. The supporting actors as the ship crew and pirates were excellent. The director creates an excellent balance of urgency and fear through out the entire movie. There should be an academy nomination for best picture, actor, and supporting actor.",9,1,3,17 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too much like the first and third
","Too much like the first and third installments.  I liked Jarr Jarr, and the young Obe-One, and the older guy, but the story lacked.  The race scene did not get across well on the big screen, but was a good idea on paper.  Why did they kill Darth-mall, he was the best character in the film!  They always kill the good bad guys!  I thought Obe cheated in the fight, with that little dirty trick of picking up his saber, and cutting the guy when he is looking down, but I guess he could not beat him any other way.  If you watch the film you can see who the Dark Over Lord is, a bit of foreshadowing.  I gave it a 6.",6,0,2,2 April 2002
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Romance novel movie!
","My wife just could not wait to see Breaking Dawn! I took my wife to Breaking Dawn, and I was one of the few guys in the theater. The movie is different from Expendables! Breaking Dawn is like a Romance Novel. Edward and Bella get married and go on their honeymoon. Then a problem arises! The movie has it all. Conflict, babies, two guys interested in one girl etc. The movie picked up in the second half when the conflict began. The usual Edward/Jacob feud continues. Well, acted, and directed movie. There was no inconsistencies or bad acting with Breaking Dawn. I would give the movie a 6 out of 10, but my wife would give it a 10. She is upset that she has to wait a full year for part 2 especially since it is already filmed. The movie company and actors are just trying to make more bucks off of the series just like Harry Potter.",Null,4,12,18 November 2011
3:10 to Yuma," Good fall movie
","8 out of 10. A good movie well directed, acted, and an interesting story. Reminds me of the spaghetti Westerns, with Yuma's style and artistic imagery. Russell Crowe is an outstanding actor. Crowe excels in any role. In Yuma, Crowe is rough, but smart and gentle at the same time. Crowe does not dominate a leading role, but dominates an entire film. It does not matter what the role is, Crowe adapts and becomes that character. I love the ending where Crowe is a bad guy only for the adventure, not the money, and wants to see Bale impress his boy. See this Western at the Theater. LionGate Films is releasing some risky movies like Saw that set new trends. Bravo!",8,1,3,1 October 2007
The Expendables 2," Better and worse than Expendables 1
","Expendables 2 in some ways is better than Expendables 1, and in some ways worse. The Good : The story about the computer on the plane etc is a better storyline than expendables 1. There are better opening sequences in Expendables 2 then Expendables 1 with a surprise twist! I will not ruin the sequence in it by telling you. Arnold plays a bigger role in part 2 and clashes well with Sly. The Bad: There are too many action stars in the film, which dilutes the movie. All the actors have only cameo appearances, which hurts the movie's flow. In fact, Jet Li is cut out of the film early. I believe because of lack of film time there is not as much martial arts in Expendables 2 as compared to Expendables one. Expendables One had a better final fight scene, and a better bad guy because the movie's actors had more film time to work with their characters. Conclusion: Expendables 2 is more entertaining then Expendables 1, but the film's actors can shine like in the first movie. I give Expendables 2 a 6 or 7 out of ten.",6,0,5,22 August 2012
War Dogs," worth watching
","Non politically correct, has warts and all. Watching War Dogs is like watching a train wreck. You know the train wreck is going to happen, you just cannot help watch the wreck out of a morbid curiosity. War Dogs has stereotypes, ugly characters, and even nastier real life experiences. War Dogs is a buddy story of, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. When someone has a friend who a bad influence you know there is going to be trouble. No matter what the good intentions are you know the bad influence can not help but be himself. Everyone looks bad in War Dogs, governments, people and arms dealers. I felt the slime just ooze out! The moral message of easy money with fast people comes with a price hits hard! A good moral in of family/wife over money. War Dogs is directed at a fast pace, which transitions from sub story to sub story well. The Packouz/Diveroli characters create a synergy which drives a character driven story about decidence and greed. 7 out of 10",7,1,3,24 August 2016
The Longest Yard," 6 out of 10 a second or 3rd movie rental for the night.
","6 out of 10 a 3rd rental for a movie night. T L Y is a by the numbers comedy, and performs the comedy by the numbers well. Enertaining movie, but no GroundHog Day. Very MTVish, and has a bit of the MTV style message with the film. The viewer will notice a few named actors, and a few named wrestlers, and football players. The Radiers Romanouski is in the film along with Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Kevin Nash. The football is executed well. Better than what the preview shows. A few parts could be cut on the floor. Well directed. Adam Sandler does a decent job, and finally stops doing the weird dumb and dumber humor. ( the weird humor got too much after the 3rd movie) Very close to the original movie. Do not watch the original first before seeing the remake. Over all I would suggest renting The Longest Yard remake, but with another movie with it.",6,1,4,7 June 2005
Source Code," WoW!
","Great movie! Wow was I blown away. I did not know what to expect from this movie. I was very iffy on seeing this one. What a nice surprise! One of the better scripts I have watched. The movie is written with concepts which entail the string theory, and alternative events. In the movie, the soldier has no idea of what is happening, but he must complete the same mission over and over again. What is great about Source code is the sub-plot which asks the question what effects does the experiment have with the present? I will not ruin the movie by writing anymore. I give source code a 9 or 10 out of 10. Source code was not my first movie pick yesterday! I am very happy we went to see Source code over battle Los Angles.",9,0,2,4 April 2011
Skyfall," The good and the bad!
","Skyfall has some good and bad elements: The good: Skyfall is well directed and acted. There is no weak point in any scene or performance. The movie is a throw back to the old Sean Connery movies. There is no P C messages, characters or themes. Skyfall's story and characters are just as they are. Bond is a Connery type who is a ruthless killer who is loyal for God and country. The bad guy is a whack Job who is who he is because of betrayal. The bad: Has no neat gadgets which I love to see. There is no invisible cars etc. The bond movie is void of any humor ie. like in the Roger Moore era. In the end, Drench is gone and the old Bond is returning with the introduction of new realistic characters. I give Skyfall a six out of ten. Not one of the better Bond movies but a transitional Bond movie as the series re-invents itself.",6,1,7,11 November 2012
The Hangover," Not as good as old school!
","Not as good as Old School. The Hangover is an okay movie, but falls short of the gold standard. The cast was not as strong as in Old School. One can tell who in the script of the Hangover would be Wil, Vince, and Luke. Too old and expensive is the old cast from Old School. The script in the Hangover is funny in spots, but they showed the best moments in the trailer. I liked the movie but the Hangover is more of rental. I would give the film a six or seven out of ten. One sees some of the cast from Old School in the Hangover, and few of the Old School gags were added into the film. I think they were paying homage to the classic Old School.",6,0,4,22 July 2009
Ghost," This is a good film
","My wife loves this film, and I found it more then a romance movie.  A intriguing story, of deception, death, the after life, and greed.  This is a great film, with character you care about, suspense, romance, and a fresh script.  This film made Patricks carrier, and after this film  he chose a few films that killed his chances of acting in higher budget films.  I believe if he picked a couple more scripts like this one he would be on the same level as Tom Cruse.  I think the politically correct 90's found him too macho for their tastes, and it drove him to do that film about India which helped kill his carrier.  In the end this film is a little about what Patrick could have been, a true international star.",8,38,56,17 August 2001
Iron Man 3," Not enough Iron Man too much Tony Stark.
","Not enough Iron Man too much Tony Stark. The acting and directing was great but the story was not. Iron man three started out strong with a bad guy and problems, but then went into Tony Stark's personal life problems etc. I kept asking myself when is Iron Man coming into the story? Iron Man three became, a made for T V, Tony solves a mystery story. There were all the clichés a kid, a old lover, a vindictive wronged bad guy etc. I could of wrote a better script. One too many plot twists and plot devices. Iron man three is not great, but watchable. I give Iron Man three a six out of ten. Funny how part three movies usually run out of ideas.",6,3,7,6 May 2013
The Ring," Evil
","This film was disturbing, scary and intriguing.  The movie startsout strong and revolves around a  mystery.  Some of it is stupid,but most of the film is okay.  The stupid stuff gets cleared up lateron in the film.  I thought the movie was going to have anotherstupid horror film ending, but I was shocked.  It leaves room for apart two.  It is worth seeing in the theater.  Do not see it if you donot like scary or evil movies.  8/10",8,0,1,25 October 2002
Spartacus," A Movie that ages well
","I usually do not like long movies, but this one did not drag.  A good movie about obtaining one's freedom.  It had good acting and realistic battle scenes.  You can see were Gladitor and Braveheart got its influences.  This is the first movie that I seen Kirk Douglas act.  I can see where Michael was influenced.  This is one of the best epics.",7,3,5,29 March 2002
Deepwater Horizon," One solid film!
","A good movie: A time framed story which chronologically counts down of what happened with the infamous BP gulf oil spill! Who did what? Safety concerns, managements push for profits over safety and the suspicion that something was wrong! Great acting from the lead roles. Kurt Russell is the ever vigilant, all knowing alpha male safety consultant. Kurt Russell's character was a hard edge in a serious Charlton Heston way. Mark Whalberg is the family oriented caring professional loved by his crew. John Malkovich is the the push for it's costing us profits manager and is manipulative. The management team does not answer why the safety team's check was cancelled. Deepwater Horizon background of the rig, processes, and extras gave the realism of the oil platform. Berg directs the foreground and background of oil rig procedures and characters into a realistic disaster story so well, that Deep Water Horizion is hard to Watch! Eight out of ten. There is even an explanation that the well is so deep that the pressure of the earth and oil was too great for the dig.",8,0,1,8 August 2017
United 93," Fresh Style
","I like documentaries, and the documentary style of Greengrass is fresh! The only negative is the bouncing camera work, I find it disorienting, and the bouncing gave my wife a headache. Using the real life people gave a documentary feel. No PC or political agenda just the actions of real people. The heroic behavior of everyone trying to save the country from the attack had to be told. The part with the controllers in the tower and the J Sac command gave realism similar to Black Hawk Down. Worth renting. I will never forget that horrific day, with the death of so many. I was shocked to see a few people at work happy about it. I guess this shows the evil in this world and how ugly evil is. 7 out of 10. A movie onto itself.",7,1,2,25 June 2006
It," So So
","A breath of fresh air from today's redundant comic book scripts and politically correct movie scripts, which are predictable and formulated. The retelling of a horror story from a story master. If your watching the script for the first time the movie is exciting. If like me, the viewer saw the mini-series then the same old same storyline of King's group of misfit kids battling in another Stand by me. The flawed characters grab the viewers interest and give real life to a fictional story. Adolescence dealing with dysfunctional parents is a theme of It which creates realistic teenage angst. It's humor and behavior etc reminds me of growing up. Everyone hates the clown too, which represents fears and plays on weaknesses. Well acted and directed etc for a good thriller. Seeing so many of Kings' work the remake becomes dated. 6 out of 10 stars.",6,11,23,11 September 2017
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," So stupid it actually worked!
","So stupid it actually worked! When I bought this movie I thought it would be awful or good. No in between! Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is about the 16th President's secret life as a vampire hunter. The story line where vampires were in the South and used slavery for a steady blood supply. Vampires or the undead were trying to take over the United States. Abe chose to battle the undead. What worked was the fictional events woven into historical facts. The characters were interesting and Abe was likable. Abe is an axe wielding, smart, and has backwoods charm. Without ruining the movie, Abe with his cohorts, went on a secret mission to save the Union with some exciting C G I effects. A memorable ending. Worth watching.",7,1,2,23 September 2014
Minority Report," Cruise bounces back
","SPOILER!!!!After Cruise's last 2 horrible movies, he bounces back.  Another bomb like Vanilla Sky would have destroyed his career.  Interesting sci-fi film with the issue of determinism  versus free will.  It would be scary if the future was set.  At least being human we all have free will to decide what we will do and what path one will take in life.   The film had a happy together ending which is nice considering the content of the film.  The eye ball scene is pretty gross. 8/10",8,0,1,26 June 2002
Training Day," Unbelievable, too over the top.
","This could be a good film, but I found this too over the top.  Parts of the plot become weak, and the ending is too much.  Why would they show a rookie too much on his first day?  I can not see why Washington got an award for this one.  There are bad cops out there, but if I wore the uniform I would find this movie insulting.",4,27,56,27 March 2002
Friday Night Lights," Filmed like a documentary
","Friday Night Light's is filmed like a documentary. I personally learned much about American high school football. In Canada, where Canadians only play 3 downs, high school football only has the parents, and some guy walking his dog by the park watching the game. In America, real football culture, with radio shows, ex players wearing their rings, and a crowd of 12000 a game. I believe one player's dad's problem was the dad had nothing else after high school football. The father peaked at 17! Billy Bob actually plays a good role. I was surprised the makers added realism, and seriousness of the game showing many hidden aspects like racial politics, violent on field intimidation, and fear of losing. I can not believe the Astro dome was filled for a high school game. Worth seeing on the big screen 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,20 October 2004
John Wick," Not bad for movie cheap night.
","Not bad for movie cheap night. My wife and I went to John Wick on cheap Tuesday. John Wick was a good stress release for a bad week. What worked: Reeve's is a physical actor, how he moves, walks, etc and plays the action sequences well. Jason Statham would have been a better John Wick. The revenge plot where mobsters kill John's dog and steals his car resonates with the viewer. What did not work: The action is too fast in a video game style. There was a need for more humor, which the movie Mel Gibson's Payback implemented well. If you are in the market for a revenge flick I recommend Payback over John Wick. John Wick is okay. A VOD movie. Six out of ten.",6,0,18,15 November 2014
Kung Fu Panda," It was funny!
","When I saw the preview I didn't know what to expect knowing that Jack Black was in it. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing. I liked the part where they were hiding food under the pots and playing the shell game with them. Jack Black did a good role. I like the noodle dad; this guy seems to be in all Kung Fu movies. Dustin Hoffman was great as the master. The film has a good message for kids in believing one's self. The animation was great. I didn't recognize Angelina Jolie as the voice of the tiger warrior. The film is entertaining for both adults and children. My wife loves animated movies so that is why we attend this film. My wife gives it a 8 of 10 Kung Fu kicks.",8,2,3,12 June 2008
Gravity," Gravity has several meanings
","Gravity movie title has several meanings for the film. Gravity has several themes. The gravity of the situation. What gravity actually is? The gravity of event in life. The Gravity of the situation is the movie's story of a chain of events which happens after a explosion in space. The explosion projectiles destroy Stone's and Kowalski's space walk and the two must find a way home. A exciting story! The second theme what gravity actually does or lack of it does not do creates a problem as Stone and Kowalski drift through space. The lack a gravity causes great 3 D effects and creates dialogue for Stone(Bullock) and Kowalski(Clooney). The viewer experiences kowalski's character who is a leader is clam, problem solver, generous, moral, and optimistic. Stone is a reserved, shy and disillusioned person. The theme expressed for the characters is the gravity of life. Stone's daughter's death causes disillusion and doubt with life and her ability to get back home. Kowalski's is a hard charger who's optimistic charm pushes the situation forward. The gravity of situation is about going home and going onward in life. Gravity weighs in at an eight out of ten.",8,4,8,5 October 2013
Lone Survivor," A feel of grit and realism!
","The Lone Survivor creates the experience of grit and realism. A strong start where the viewer is inundated with Seal code, by experiencing hell week. Honor, duty, commitment from training is segued into the base experience where the story evolves into Seal's commitment of family/loyalty. One understands why procedures need to be met and not deviated from , but are in conflict with the value of protecting one's Seal brother. There are protocols for reasons and going against it results in dire consequences. Without giving the story away, all I can write is a true story is better than fiction. One experiences there are good and bad in all people. The director and actors where believable. Bana and Whalberg shined in their roles. I give Lone Survivor a seven out of ten.",7,4,14,12 January 2014
Wind River," Reason I go out to the theater instead of watching T V
","Wind River is the reason I go out to the theater instead of watching T V. What I hate about T V Wind River avoids. Instead of 2 d characters, there is a developed story here not another overly too tough Jodi Foster F B I lead, the usual evil bad guys, and the happy face, likable over heroic Sheriff with the over preachy social message. Instead Wind River unfolds a story of what really happened. The film is set on and around a reservation in Wyoming. The director Taylor Sheridan creates a bleak cold back ground environment where nature and the harsh climate takes a toll. A dead woman, a murder and characters trying to scrape by melds into a story. Kelsey Asbille's character is a fish out of water F B I agent who needs Jeremy Renner's, a fish and game officer's help. There is character development between the two protagonists as the story unfold. Graham Greene and the other characters guide the audience through the psychological thriller of a script of characters who give small pieces of the story. In the end, the murder is the wrong place/wrong time, drunk, bored, with the one idiot catalyst which sets off the string of tragic events. A over the top story climax for effect, which leaves an impression on the viewer. 8 out 10. True story telling. Eight out of Ten",8,0,4,28 August 2017
Erin Brockovich," Roberts best
","I was waiting for this huge social lecture;I like these type of films, but hate the lectures.  Instead, I found a entertaining, yet realistically acted film.  It was enjoyable to watch how mistakes happen, intentionally, or people just not caring, and lawyers (for a change not being the bad guy) give people the opportunity for amends.  Regrettably money will never be a true payment for justice, but the people at least were able to move.  I wonder how many of these man made disasters happen?  In Canada, we seem too have cover ups where I read the paper, and nothing ever get resolved with many issues.  I wonder if they get settled out of court.  A movie is like a few pictures of a very complex event.  I found this movie, it may have been dramatized, gave me a better understanding of the events.8 out of 10",8,1,2,17 May 2004
Meet the Parents," Hilarious
","Comedies seem to be Robert De Niro's new line of work.  He seems to do comedies very well.  (ie analyze this)  This film by far is the best comedy this year; it is sort of like the movie 'The Party'.  It's about not fitting in, and feeling left out.  Many can relate with this experience of a fish out of water situation.  This guy (Focher)is a constant accident waiting to happen.  See it... Watch it... Laugh....",8,0,1,17 October 2000
Wayne's World," Inferior version of Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure!
","I remember reading a MAD comic's version of Wayne's World, and it put my review into a nut shell.  At the end of the comic, Bill and Ted have Wayne and Garth in a phone booth sent off into oblivion; while yelling 'you stoled our movie'.  Funny, but the truth usually is!  Michael Myers, not the guy from Halloween, has written many comical hits, and if he leaves acting will probably keep on writing.  This movie is made from a recurring SNL skit. The skit can be funny, but like the hosers of The Great White North Fame, it has trouble keeping a few minutes comedy skit into a full length comedy. Making something funny is the hardest form of entertainment, and this movie has more hits than misses in its antics.  It will always be compared to the Classic Bill and Ted's; not as good but watchable. (especially good is the Laverne & Shirley skit)  6/10",6,0,3,21 September 2002
Star Trek," They had to change it!
","I liked the New Star Trek. The movie differed from the very old TV show. Why? The writers put a worm hole in the script, which cause two different out comes for the characters in the present. Resulting, in the new Star Trek having an excellent plot twist with two Spocks one older and the other younger living at the same time. I will not ruin the movie, but the characters are different with the time space continuum shift. A more reckless Kirk, and more emotional Spock. I bet we get a new TV series spin off from the movie. Worth watching I give the movie a seven out of ten. This movie will create new fan, and old Trekies will find the plot twist interesting!",7,0,10,21 May 2009
Fury," One strong movie!
","I went into the theater wondering if Fury would be just another war movie. Been there done that. Fury is well acted, written, and directed. The character driven story is one of Pitt's strongest performances. The story of an innocent young recruit who is mentored by a harden warrior. As the movie unfolds one sees the human side of Pitt's character tempered with the warrior side(Brad Pitt). The director unfolds the brutality of the human experience, and the reasoning for the butchery. The Waffen S S marching scene creates an essence of the spirit and fanaticism of the enemy. One understands after seeing the enemy why Pitt's character goes on the suicide mission. Compassion/responsibility drives Pitt's character to fight so others may live. A powerful ending where a young S S soldier shows his human side gave the movie hope in a world of brutality. Fury is an eight star movie.",8,2,7,23 October 2014
Fight Club," 10
","Great Movie.  When I entered the movie  theater I did not know what to expect. This movie is very anti  pc (political correctness), the director sets the mode that many people can relate to. (the lead actors plight).  A repressed person who lives with a very repressed job, everything about his job is very sterile.  He has to be very organized, careful what he says, and follows what society and corporate cultures tells him.  As how one should think, and what is considerd sucessful.   Fight club evolves from this foray as and escape from societies pressures.  A sort of mid-evil escape where prime evil urges can be played out. fight club it self grows from this environment. The movie very carfully and slight of hand show this message about society and the presure it builds on people.",Null,3,9,17 November 1999
Monster," Not that great!
","Gut feeling tells me that they left some of the truth out of this story! They made the killer look nicer, and less crazy than real life.  Who can say what makes one do these horrible deeds.  Genes or environment whatever.  I am sure there is a point where people snap in life.    I found some of the film interesting, but the rest of the story has a 70's misunderstood bad guy theme to it.  I find working at the post office with some very bitter people in it scary and unsettling; they have a mean streak or hatred for the world I found missing in this film.  The movie 'In cold blood' is a better portrayal for this topic.  Some of her victims were not the best quality people, but I sure hate to ever get in the way of this enraged, bitter woman.  I find bitter people create more carnage, where I prefer the situation defused.  Don't bother with this one.  5 out of 10",5,0,4,12 June 2004
The Rookie," Believe in your dreams
","What is meant to be will happen.  Saint Rita  interceded, and with God anything can happen is the message.  This movie displays hope in a hopeless world.  Which is a good message, and an inspiration for all.  This is a happy story, and a movie about values and people.  Where I work many of my coworkers hope for others to fail, and this movie shows what supportive people can achieve.  8/10",8,2,3,8 November 2002

This Is the End," bothersome movie
","A group of self absorbed blank blank are at a Hollywood part when the apocalypses happens. The humor can be vial and stupid. There is a few laughs. However, the apocalypses is such a grim topic that one when finds the movie disturbing. This Is the End's view of the apocalypse is a hell on earth. I must admit some of the interpretation of hell was too close to being real. This Is the End made me wonder what hell is like? What the apocalypses well be like? The movie is cheesy and stupid. Still watchable, but disturbing. I give this Is the End a seven out of ten. Not for everyone. I hope they do not make a part 2. Just okay.",7,0,6,28 June 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Fast paced
","Spoiler  This film is well paced.  My wife likes the original better, but my opinion differs from hers.  I, personally, find that over the years, directing, film quality, acting, editing, and special effects have improved.  I see this improvement with this film.  The film makers made the story different enough from the original, that the view is not watching a repeat.  It starts out well, with the nurse and others finding a strange infection, no one knows how it starts, the nurse and husband should have been paying attention to the TV.  Morning comes and this is the best part of the film, anarchy happens, like how I believe events would really happen, ie. the van hitting the car.  This movie shows how attitudes have changed over the years, with lots of the characters having jerkitist,  I find this very realistic, this jerkitist plague we have today is spreading fast like the zombies.  This fits into the story, I am surprised no one has picked up on the story's social message.  This zombie plague is brought on my humanity as a punishment, the evil that we do.  When the minister said when hell is full the dead will walk the earth.  This means the Zombies are the damned, humanity was so bad they filled up hell and had no other place to go but with the living.  They are suffering on earth, and prey on the living out of rage.  That is why they do not care about the dog in the movie.  That is why going to an island or under water or anywhere doesn't matter; the damned will just walk across the lake they can't die, just their body does.  The film shows how no one cares and causes this effect, except for a few.  In the end, humanity was damned this is how I interpret this film.  What caused it is for your own mind to make up. 9 out of 10  Mike",9,0,1,10 April 2004
Two for the Money," Not bad but sad
","Well, a OK movie. I did notice some old USFL footage from the 80's the NFL would not want to be tied with this film I guess. I recognized a few old USFL teams if one looks closer at the film. The Boston/ New Orleans Breakers, Mephis Show Boats, L A Express (I believe the quarter back was Steve Young), and The New Jersey Generals ( I believe the quarter was Doug Flutie). A couple of teams I could not recognized. Back to the movie, directing at a good pace, and well acted. The gambler Pacino is a sad and unlikable character. The movie is a down beat film with the message of gambler appetite for destruction and pushing life too hard. It is never winning 20 its losing 200. The end is about life choice and one is what the protagonist does. 6 out of 10",6,0,3,12 October 2005
Alien: Resurrection," Could they let this series die please
","Does the film industry have so little originality, that it must kill a 20 year old film series with beating this dead horse to the point of patheticness.  No story, the actors did well considering this film, and a film which no one really cares what happens to the actors in it.  I wonder if they will make an Alien 5, and if they do maybe it will get to compete with Rambo 8, Jaws 12, Friday the 13th part32 (Jason works at McDonalds), and other sequels that should just die like the evil Alien in this film",3,0,1,7 January 2002
World War Z," Only half a movie.
","world War Z is fast paced, well acted, with an interesting story. If a out break happened we would have trouble. I love how we study for the weakness, and strengths of a virus. The 9 out of 10 people theory where we go with 10th person outlandish idea is a great theme. The movie is a mix of War of the Worlds meets cognition. The problem with World War Z is the ending. There is no explanation of why? There is no explanation of how to solve the problem? The ending left the viewer empty. The movie could be gearing up for part 2. Brad Pitt does another outstanding role. He seems to have left his outrageous weird roles like fight club, and True Romance. His new genre seems to be action, family and playing the hero. I give World War Z a seven out 10.",7,15,30,26 June 2013
The Hunger Games," The best movie this year by far!
","2012 has been a lame year for movies so far, until not! The Hunger Games is the best movie I have seen this year! The Hunger Games is a mix of political philosophy meets survivor which meets a love triangle. The story's subplots are mixed into an excellent story. The main plot is about a futuristic society where the capital's government selects from twelve districts one young boy and girl to be in a modern day version of the show survivor where the contestants fight to the death. The government creates the show as a punishment for the rebellion against the government. The president wants to create a Machiavellian concept of hope and fear and hope to subjugate the public. The story creates intrigue of what is the government going to do next with the show. The game provides much movie action were the reality show is a much more violent version of survivor. There is a love interest with a boy who loves a girl which is in love with another guy. Action, intrigue, and forbidden love the three pillars/themes for a great story. The movie is well acted and directed. I give the hunger games a nine out of ten. I love this movie.",9,3,16,25 March 2012
Shaun of the Dead," Good but not Great
","Hearing so much about 'Shaun of the Dead' built my expectations high. 'Shaun of the Dead' is a parody of zombie movies with ever day life; any generation Xer will get the factory/service industry humor. Xers live a very left out, hard paced, brain dead Zombie existence. I can relate to this humor with my job, and the people around me. Over educated Xer's expect more, and have seen a depressing decline in the quality of life, while parents and other generations sometimes do not understand us; the family part of the movie explains this perfectly. Life seems pretty bad after college were one makes all their contacts. There is a lot of social humor about gen X in this film. Many people who live in such situations need a childish friend like Shaun has which Shaun needs for stress releases. No one else understands why Shaun hangs out with his loser friend, but this friend keeps Shaun sane. The Zombie humor would not work if done on this side of the Atlantic; the British have a flair for dry(in a good way like dry red wine) foolish humor. The she's drunk scene was great, along with the dad turning off the car radio. Comedy is hard to do, and the film's makers got away with making a funny movie with such a hard concept. Worth renting the DVD over the going to see it. 6 or 7 out of 10, but I probably buy the movie. I love dry humor. One part of the movie that surprised me is how similar the service industry is marketed with North American style Best Buy and Wal-Mart shops.",6,3,8,25 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not enough Jack Sparrow
","There was not enough of Jack Sparrow in the movie! The first story's protagonist Jack Sparrow's personality carried the film. The absence of Sparrow's character kills the movie. The dialog of Jack Sparrow is not as strong as the first movie. I found Jack sparrow's look is like Captain Morgan on the rum advertisement. Could the coincidence be a marketing ploy for rum? Your guess is good as mine. The movie drags in spots and a little too much fantasy. I believe the movie is more a prequel for the final of the series. The sets and acting were okay. I was tired for the second feature at the drive-in. Thus I appear to be a little critical. With this in mind, wait for the rental. 6 out of 10!",6,1,3,26 July 2006
Argo," A good movie.
","Argo is a good movie because: Argo at the introduction shows a time line of Iran's history leading up to the 1979 Islamic revolution. The character development is excellent. One senses the urgency for the characters and how the characters behave from the scenes from the taken of the American embassy. I like the part where the one person you think is going to crack helps out the most, which is so true in real life. The C I A is portrayed as governmental. However, some people who work for the C I A will sacrifice for a job and when successful are given no credit for the people involved. I do not know how much of the real story was changed because of time constraints or in order to dramatized the movie. Besides the above mentioned point, I found Argo educational and entertaining. Ben Affleck is becoming a good director. Ben has gone a long way from the O'Bannion character from the movie Dazed and Confused. Eight out of ten.",8,6,10,15 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not as good as the first Star Trek but still good.
","Not as good as the first Star Trek but still good. The first Star Trek had a certain synergy from discovering the new characters. The second instalment lacked the extra spark of the first instalment. What did work and made Into Darkness a good film is: Into the Darkness has great story and character development. Many parts of the film pay homage to earlier instalments with enough of a twist of not repeating the old story lines. If one looks at the script close enough the viewer experience the genius of the Kirk, Klingon war. Why the Kilngon's hate and respect Kirk and the same time is revealed with Into darkness. The introduction of the new Kahn character made for a strong film. Kahn is a true war machine in many ways. The viewer experiences how Kirk makes his own rules for a higher good. Logically, the Spock character provides a logical counter balance to Kirk's rational. The question of ethics, rules and good intentions versa consequences is a great theme for Into Darkness. I like Into Darkness which is an entertaining film. I give the second instalment a seven out of ten.",7,3,7,31 May 2013
Public Enemies," One of the better summer movies
","Public Enemies, not to be mixed up with the old school Rap guys Public Enemy, (I know bad joke couldn't help myself) is one of the better summer movies this year. If you are a Michael Man fan you will appreciate his mixture of music with intents action. The story is very close to the real life happenings of John Dillenger. The script writers gave the story a good balance of action and love interests. The casting was excellent, and I believe Christian Bale will become Hollywoods next mega start. Bale plays the serious heavy while Johny Depp balances the cast with more a more charming role. I would suggest to anyone to go out and see 'Public Enemies'. I give the summer film a seven out of ten.",7,3,8,6 July 2009
The Girl Next Door," sick
","Spoilers! My wife did not appreciate this movie at all. This has got to be right up there with Boogie Nights. All they needed was Dino Velvet from 8 mm to produce. The beginning was the dorky guy's next door fantasy. The blond would not give him the time of day in real life. Then the movie turns into sick humor, ie. the lap dance with the neighbor. Then it just tries to get shocking with making a porn movie in the school. I thought that it could of been a romantic comedy, but it was more of a shock movie. The only part that was good was the porn producer. His role was believable. 3/10 My wife thought it was a total brain dead movie.",3,2,7,21 September 2004

The movie starts like a children's movie then turns into an adult comedy. I laughed at the Flash Gordon party scene! There are a few other stupid Family guy scenes in the movie Ted. A few crude scenes. The movie has drugs, sex etc and is not a family movie. I needed the stress relief so I laughed at this film I give Ted an eight out of ten.

I personally like the subway scene.  This movie explains why Spider-man is Spider-man.  The show down is interesting. The movie leaves an intro for Spider-man 3.  This film is entertaining, and has a fast pace.  The fight scenes with Doctor Oct are excellent.  Watching this film on the big screen at the Drive-In enhances the experience.  I am happy to see this film before watching it on TV.  I can not wait for the producers to introduce Electro, that villain is the best.  Spider-man 2 is a 7 or 8 out of 10.",Null,1,3,7 July 2004

Gill is an angel fish with a whole bunch of scars over him.  It makes it look like he's had a hard life.  He picks his roles very well.  There is a part where there are two seagulls floating on the water when an air bubble goes by his butt.  The other seagull looks at him and says 'nice' and flies off.  This movie makes seagulls look so stupid.  It has the disney quality that one would expect.  Very nice ending. This is a must see on the big screen. 9/10,9,0,0,7 June 2003

Creed picks up when Stalone is introduced. Stories of ageing the past, and Rocky reaching out for others creates a compelling story. The ending and beginning is just like the original Rocky. The Stalone segment compels new character aspects where Rocky become Micky a former boxer turned trainer! Creed is a strong but no Rocky.

Sometimes people portray what they are really not.  It takes a talented person to be able to see through all that hoopla. Many of the things the woman did in the film were annoying and psychotic. They were using each other and in the end it worked against them for the one thing that was unexpected.8/10,8,0,0,13 July 2003
Alexander," A pale comparison to the movie Troy
","Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' is a pale comparison to the movie 'Troy'. 'Alexander' is not a bad movie, but not good either. The acting is excellent with the cast, and a story one can follow. When Oliver Stone make a film, 20 minutes can be cut out or the movie drags. 60'd type drug effects in parts of the movie, like Stone's other film 'The Doors', not needed. Too much of Alexander's wife in the film. I give Stone credit this is a hard task to create. (Epic films have to be though and history left to interpretation) Stone's 'Nixion' was a better film, but of course personal interpretation leaves room for error. I did not mind the film. There is a but in here, and the but is. Even with the big screen I would suggest wait for video. 6 out of 10. I might like it more if I watch the film a second time and pick more up.

Troy," I will buy the DVD
","Spoiler!!  The best movie so far for 2004.  Well acted with a strong cast, no one is weak in their role.  This will be Brad Pitt's break through role.  Finally a leading role, instead of a smaller role to display his talents; another Heston.  The director keeps a great pace between the action, personalities, and the film's development.  Fast, yet not to fast, like many video game style movie, where the viewer can absorb the movie.  The fight between Hector and Achilles is a present day classic, that will be copied and remembered for years.  The script shows the actions and characters as human who thought and believed before Christian time.  3 d characters who were both bad and good, this is not a good guys and bad guys script more like a reality investigation.  I am sure with time, and filming some parts were wrong or shorten, but I gained a better understanding of classic history. Thank you Wolfgang!

The movie's script is written in a slow burn style. I was thinking Orphan is another by the numbers psycho child horror film. However the slow start and the predictable plot is calibrated into the story by the plot twist and makes for a great story. Wow, I did not see the plot twist coming. I was blind sided. The movie follows the school of Hitchcock. Orphan is the best movie so far this summer. I would give Orphan a eight or nine out of ten. Go see Orpahan in the movie theater.",8,2,4,27 July 2009

","Okay movie! When I watch a movie like 'The Hustler' I see the evolution and improvements of movie making. The Hustler is still a good movie, with strong acting by Newman, Scott, and Gleason. There are some strong movie scenes in the pool hall. The scenes where Newman hustles a few people are great. However, there are disjointed scenes where Newman and his love interest become part of the story. The love interest scenes get across as flat. The ending with Newman's girlfriend is formulated and stale. The final scene in the pool hall with Newman is too dramatic. Good acting considering the times they worked in. Six out of ten stars.

","Not as good as Star Trek, but an OK summer movie. Terminator salvation started out strong, but got bogged down near the end. Why does the way to important leader go on a single handed dangerous mission at the end of the film? Other than that the film is good. What I liked about Salvation is Christian Bale acting creates a believable charter of John Conners. I like how San Francisco become the capital of Skynet being the computer center of the world. The machines were neat to watch. Other than that Terminator salvation is another production line sic-fi movie. I give this film an 6 out of 10. If I had a choice I would rather go to Star Trek. I think Star Trek will be the big summer movie.",6,0,2,22 May 2009
Insomnia," Very European
","I find European films can be either extremely well done, or done on a low budget; where a quality story is replaced with shock value.(ie nudity and bizarre events)  Much, like today's real life TV where shock replaces a high budget for ratings. I never seen the Swedish version,(it may be Norway, or Finland) of this film, and it must be excellent.  I figure if a producer will spend big money on a remake it will be good like Unfaithful.  The European film story is usually more complex than North American style.  I like this film's story, where the cop gets caught in a pickle, and can not incriminate himself.  This is a story of strings, where bad choices can pull other strings and create other problem.  The killer tries to make himself be like the cop, but he gives clues that this is an untruth.  In the end, another cop is given the same choice, and that leaves an impression on the viewer.  Like Unfaithful one see the ramification of there actions. 9/10",9,0,1,24 May 2002
Concussion," Profit before people!
","Concussion is about profit before people. Football/N F L is cultural and economically a big social force when one challenges football one is challenging America itself. Post Concussion syndrome has been ignored and ignorance of the condition creates a culture of profit before people. Concussion accurately portrays the madness that dementia induces as proteins suffocates the brain. Mike Webster became a homeless man left behind. A outsider (from Africa) with no idea of the N F L wonders how do these athletes get early dementia. M R I/ Cat scans show nothing and on the coroner's own dollar uses slices of Webster's brain and discovers brain trauma. Concussion is an example of scientific method vs emotion and corporate greed. Well acted and directed, one experiences people getting fired, strain, and emotional dark side of humanity. One of the N F L board members turns his back on a dementia teammate only to suffer ironically the same fate. After the board member's suicide does the N F L finally get it. A painful learning experience. A movie of faith, values and finding the truth, Seven out of ten.",7,4,8,28 December 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," Worth going to the big screen
","The effect for this disaster movie should be seen on the big screen.  I love the effects.  The story itself is based on a theory that the ice age is induced by weather pattern changes from the ocean's currents.  Sorry no meteor in this one.  A little sappy and preachy but not the pc rubbish the left coast can create.  The film is some what believable of how the United States would react to a New Ice Age.  The next new world power would be Australia and Argentina if the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out, and everyone moves to Mexico.  This movie follows all the disaster movie's topics such as people learning to adapt and improvise or die.  My guess for 'The Day After Tomorrow' if my science is right.  Some of the coastal areas would be ok because of the Ocean's ability to absorb the cold.  The US could do some ice blasting and moving and Paint the snow black in order to melt the ice faster and have the sun's rays absorb instead of reflect the heat would help with the battle with the new glacier.  The U S would be the Gulf states and what is left around the Mexican border.  Not a bad movie, one worth watching 7 out of 10",7,1,6,29 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Still not enough Jack Sparrow
","Still not enough Jack Sparrow. The last two films miss the leading protagonist charisma. If I watch the first film I see how Jack Sparrow carries the film. The conclusion is interesting. The movie deals with the second installment conflicts and provides the series a final resolution. The humor and special effect is their, but lacks heart. I think there was a need for new character to inject some humor; a Jack Sparrow antagonist is a good idea. The movie could be scary for small kids like my sister in-laws five year old. The audience in Grand Forks during my hollidays gave the film mix reviews. I like the film. The movie would be a second feature at the drive inn. 6 out of 10. Do not buy the film just rent it. Did I mention not enough Jack Sparrow ha ha.",6,0,2,21 June 2007
A Bridge Too Far," Good but not great
","This movie is well acted, and has an incredibly high budget.  It is worth seeing, because of these 2 factors, but the film ends negatively, and the viewer leaves the film on a downer.  Well, they have to do this, in order of having a historically accurate film.  This film is about operation Market Garden, and what happens to a military operation, when Murphy's law comes into effect.  Everything did go wrong and even Sean Connery could not save the day.  7 out of 10",7,0,2,18 April 2001
The Terminator," Arnie's best
","This film is a sci-fi classic.  The story is about time lines and how one event affects another.  This film is great.  I like the idea of the machines and if you watch closely, one sees Arnold's movements become mechanical, especially in the bar scene.  I heard the idea came from and old Outer Limits episode, from the early 60's, starring Lenord Neymod (Spock) as the robot. In the end, the circle is complete and the flashbacks, or flash forward melt into the present. This film is a classic, and watch for the cameo appearance of Bill Paxton.",10,0,1,23 March 2002
Silent Hill," video = bad movie
","The last 2 or 3 video game/movies have a bad translation to the big screen. Silent Hill is a prime example. Thin storyline with no character development and an over reliance on special effects. Hollywood has a anti Christian message lately. The Tom Hanks' film and Slient Hill seem to portray Christians as burning or beating, and hurting people. I personally have not seen other groups picked on in this matter, maybe a anti Passion reaction; I know no group is perfect, but the agenda is over the top. The ending came as no surprise, and the viewer sees the plots slow ball coming way too soon. 4 out of 10! Soon to your 99 cent rental on Wednesday. Save your money and watch The Sniper 3 on Spike TV or watch classic pro Wrestling re-runs. I know I would. The summer has been void of any good movies so far. I hope the new Bond film will be good.",4,0,7,23 June 2006
The Hateful Eight," Hateful waste of a movie.
","The Hateful Eight is a Hateful waste of a film! Quentin Tarantino can create entertaining, original films. BUT after a few good films, Quentin craps out a real dog of a movie. I like dogs but the Hateful Eight is one ugly dog of a movie. When there is no script, story, etc we have a crap film. A crap film filled with shock, gore, profanity, racial slurs, pushing the limits with abuse, depravity etc, because there is nothing else to show. I wonder what was in the mind of the writer/director? Then again I don't want to know. Hateful Eight gives you a big name like Kurt Russell to suck you in. The only bright spot was Russell's acting and role. Otherwise, slow and slower, then gross shock/stupid. The sub story, and plot twist just look dumb. The Hateful Eight is worse than water boarding. 3 out of 10. Hateful to the viewer!",3,24,44,16 April 2016
We Were Soldiers," Mel at his best
",I think you have to see the movie twice to fully appreciate it.  Mel Gibson at his best.  I was also impressed with Sam Elliot's role.  It was hard getting used to him without his moustache.  Mel put a lot of heart into this role.  I thought the troops would be more grittier.  It was nice to see the movie incorporate the lives of the soldiers.  It must of been real hard and very cruel for the wives to receive news of their husbands' deaths by taxi. I can see why Sam Elliot's character always thought of the worst.  This movie shows what good leadership is all about.  This is Mel's best performance to date.  A must see on the big screen.,8,0,2,3 March 2002
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," I can not believe it was made in 1969
","This film is perfect, no one would believe it was made in 1969.  Editing, dialogue, acting, and the script age well.  This is Paul Newman's career high water mark.  I love the following scenes, Rules in a Knife fight, Did you use enough dynamite Butch, and If he asks us to stay will leave.   I can watch this film over and over.  With the story of 2 bank robbers who can not adapt with the new centry. The finality of the ending is powerful.  What can I say 9/10.",9,1,4,14 August 2002
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," This movie ages like a fine wine
","This movie is over 30 years old, and you could not tell it.  Other movies age terribly, and look cornier every year.  This film is one of Newmen, and Redfords  best performances.  The acting, script, and the ending is unforgetable.  When I view this film, I understand why Newmen, and Redford become icons.",9,0,2,28 August 2001
Ocean's Twelve," About as good as the original!
","Ocean's 12 is on par with Ocean's 11. Both movies jump around on the emotional level. The viewer finds parts of the movie boring and would rate Ocean's a 3. Then other parts of Ocean's become a 10. Once the viewer averages Ocean's 12 out the overall rating is a 6 or 7 out of 10. The story is weak in parts, and strong in others. The Julia Roberts bit is the highlight. Bruce Willis is great. The director's 70's or late 60's European feel is too much. Looks like a cheesy film they show on the showcase network with a low budget feel. The use of camera angles, and trickery takes the focus off the film. If a film lacks budget they use these tricks, and Ocean's 12 has no reason to use this. The acting is excellent considering the script. Brad Pitt was misused, could have added more for his character. My dad felt the same about Ocean's 12. I would rather go see Flight of the Phoneix. Wait for video or on demand. 7 or 6 out of 10.",7,1,4,29 December 2004
Snatch," Pulp Fiction with a mix of Good Fellas
","This is a movie with a mix of Pulp fiction with Good Fellas.  A British version of the 2 movies, with dark British humor.  I loved this film and laughed so hard my wife looked at me a couple of time and elbowed me to stop it.  I love dark humor and this film is full of it; this movie is not for the politically correct crowd, its more a back lash to the violence in the media people.  Brad Pit plays the role of a crazy perfectly, and has this on going joke where you could only understand half of what he says.  You would get this joke if you lived or visited Nova Scotia or some place similar (I have) or got relatives who speak in a heavy English dialect. Its the same language but you can only make out about half of what is said.  Pitt's character puts all the events into full swing of 5 different stories which meld into one, like Pulp Fiction.  This film has shooting, boxing, butchering, and very nasty dialogue, with a good story to boot.  Great film and I do not want to give away the story, my wife hated it, and wondered when it would end, but I could probably watch it a second time, and my wife will wonder if their is something wrong with me.",8,0,1,31 January 2001
The Expendables," Run of the mill action film
","Run of the mill action film! If you have seen one action film you have seen them all. I did not mind 'The Expendables', and it was nice to see and actual big budget action film made. I cannot remember the last big budget action made similar to 'The Expendables'? Maybe the last Die-hard film? Not bad acting, but a weak script. The rouge CIA operative as a bad guy has been done way to often. Big cast, I think the big cast was the hook to draw the audience in. Arnold was in the movie for 5 minutes. I wonder if Arnold was in ''The Expendable' as an Omen for an Arnold/Stallone Expendables 2. I noticed that Stegal, and Van Dame where not in this film? Maybe the action film actors will also be in a part 2. 6 out of 10. The Expendables is a rental or video on demand movie. I would watch it with beer and pizza on a Friday night.",6,0,5,25 August 2010
Final Destination 2," Better than the first.
","There is 2 elements that clash with this film.  One the horror gore element, and 2nd the philosophy part.  Yes there is a philosophy in this madness. The horror gore element will evolve into the modern Friday the 13th sequals. I can see Final destination 12 years form now with young people dieing in more dramatic fashions with each film.  Instead of a Goalie mask, and the woods as the fear stimulus, we got death and fate against us.  The first film was wimpy, especially the lead character, the new film picks up speed, and believe me the momentum will pick up with each film.  The pilosophy part of the film is about fate or absolutism verses free will and choice.  I believe if Death has a design and people out living there fate makes a time ripple against its own ends there would be no way to stop it, and the characters efforts would be useless.  The film makers create chaos theory were random event can create an order that has great effects on individuals. The plate of pasta, and the gas turn off would be 2 examples of this.  The film has its usual gross outs, and sick humor.  In the end, I give it a 7/10",7,0,1,2 February 2003
The Way Back," Worth seeing!
","Worth seeing! A great story, which makes for an interesting movie. The story alone is worth watching the movie. I would believe the book is probably better. Strong acting, and quick paced directing make for an entertaining movie with no slow spots. For a long movie to be crafted well the movie needs great character development. The walking journey with the interaction of characters creates character development where the viewer share the experiences and sympathizes with the escapees. I would give the film The Way Back 7 out of 10. It sure must have been cold on that journey. It is -40 here in Canada and we went to a mall with indoor parking to avoid the cold. I would hate to walk outside for 3 weeks in this weather.",7,6,11,26 February 2011
Alien," Not as good as the second movie
","This film is okay, but the more I watch it the less I like it.  The film does not age that well.  This film must have been a real shocker in 79, but very average in 02.   I guess the build up from Aliens 2 gives this film a big let down.  A creature runs around the ship, and we have a bunch of hack and slash.  It is worth seeing the first time, but I would not want to watch it a second time.",5,5,18,6 January 2002
Blades of Glory," Good rental
","The preview was just horrible. The movie was funny. Well directed, and acted. I like stupid humor and 'Blades of Glory' has lots of it. Such as the fight at the Olympic podium part. The toilet paper scene, and the sex addict meeting. 7 out of 10. Will does a good job, and is not over the top. Jon Herd is a talented actor we will see more of him in the future. Turn your brain off for this movie. A good rental. A weird concept. Can 2 guys skate in doubles? My bet is no! The skating scenes were great laughs. Tawnya harden part was added in. Nancy gets a bit part. I think Will is picking better movies to play in. He doing more lead roles, which he handles better with time.",7,0,1,10 September 2007
Horrible Bosses," Not a bad movie!
","Bad Bosses is a okay movie. I liked it. However, I do not know how well the movie will age? Like most comedies, in five years the movie could be lame. Horrible Bosses' thesis where people feel like they can kill their awful bosses resonates with the audience. Everyone, has had a bad boss like in the film and has empathy for the characters. The three protagonists are goofs who total screw up when trying to plan a hit. Aniston plays the psycho sexually harassing boss to the letter. The movie is a fish out of water comedy. The Prius drag racing excuse is hilarious! Kevin Spacey plays a good antagonist. Spacey helps create a strong ending for the film. I give Horrible Bosses a six or seven out of ten.",7,1,2,9 July 2011
Black Mass," Should win a few awards!
","Great movie about south Boston's Irish mob. Scott Cooper (director) was able to produce the grit and raw aggressiveness of South Boston with Black Mass's characters. The introduction of the bar bouncer's scene's dialogue and raw violence creates pace/feel for the entire film. I felt a cold chill from the beginning. Depp portrays a cold and harden criminal to perfection. F B I agent Joel Edgerton Depp's partner walks, acts, feels, like a jaded agent in it for himself. Edgerton should be nominated for best supporting actor. Black Mass's story about an unholy alliance between F B I (Edgerton) and the Irish mob (Depp) where an informant gives information for free rain while eliminating the criminal competition. Hence, the unholy alliance is a black mass which creates the story's title. A chilling true story, One could not make up such fiction. Proof real life is better than fiction.

The Santa is coming part is very good, and the fight with the department store santa is the best.  I wonder if Willy can be this strange in real life too.  Maybe he could play a movie about me if they ever did a movie on me.  Well go out and watch it this for Christmas. 7/10 Mike",7,1,1,14 December 2003
Full Metal Jacket," I did not like this film
","I did not like this film compared to the other Nam films, its quite borrish.  The training camp segment is to long.

So much potential and so little done for this film.",4,1,19,2 March 2001
American Sniper," Thought the movie would be better, but still good!
","I read the book, and thought the movie left much out. Regrettably, we would have had a 8 hour movie if the whole book was filmed. What worked: American Sniper followed the book accurately. The emotional spectrum acted by Bradly Cooper followed, was preformed perfectly. The ranges of guilt for not helping more soldiers, and the stress of combat weaves perfectly with Eastwood's direction for the movie's experience. The savagery of war, and the stress of completing the combat missions resonates with the viewer as the story unfolds. What happens after the mission is over was a perfect ending for the movie. Service, commitment, bravery, humility, were displayed as the characteristics of Chris Kyle were done in a fitting well measured character development. What did not work: Some scenes which would tell more of the American Sniper book were shorted, omitted, condensed, in the American Sniper movie. Maybe for time and or continuity reasons. Still a good movie. I give American Sniper 8 kills out of 10.",8,22,43,22 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Rivals Spiderman
","So far this year the competition for best film will be Spiderman and this movie.  It started out slow; but intriguing.  No new surprise characters in this film, ie. Hans Solo.  The best character had to be Yoda.  He is so ugly that he's cute.  We learn more about the Jedi in this episode; maybe too much.  The film has a Starship trooper influence to it, which adds to it. The ending was disappointing; no conclusion.  It just left you asking 'Is that it?'  Did they run out of time?  Maybe they should of cut some of the relationship scenes.  Worth seeing on the big screen though. 8/10",8,1,6,23 May 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," This one is on my list to buy
","This movie was absolutely funny.  John Goodman does an excellent voice for Sully.  The animation was great.  The facial expressions with the voices were out of this world.  This movie is for everyone.  It seems the animation is getting better and better, but you still have to get the perfect voices for each character.  Steve Buscemni plays as slime ball again.  This seems to be the only character he does well.  Billy Crystal was great too, but as I said John Goodman was the best.  The story was consistent and funny through out.  I was surprised to hear the voice of James Coburn.  The ending left room for a part II if they want to do one, but it will be very hard to beat this one.  9/10",9,0,2,27 September 2002
American Hustle," A well crafted hustle!
","A movie about Hustling, with a mix of politics. Without giving away much of the story I found the movie grabs the viewer and leaves the mark wanting more or experiencing what will happen next. What makes American Hustle work is the characters. Christine Bale has another strong performance. Bale's character is smart and knows the art of the con. Tell them no which creates anticipation. There is what the mark wants to believe compared to what is actually is. Knowing the mark's intentions of what they actually want is the art. What surprised me with the story is the human empathy side of Bale's character. Amy Adams' character is the art of seduction. Amy stirs desire and makes an illusion of being sot after, unattainable, but comforting. Bradly Cooper is a rookie F B I agent who knows everything, has no experience, and does not listen to his supervisor. The minor characters are Jeremy Renner doing the best for New Jersey and and De Niro as a gangster who can see through any con. The movie's characters mixed into the art of the hustle create one entertaining movie. Eight out of ten.",8,2,10,21 December 2013
The Godfather: Part II," A true movie classic!
","A true movie classic. Francis Ford Coppola unfolds two story lines past and present with graceful transitions. The beauty and symmetry of the lighting, sets, mixes with the symbolisms of the Catholic church, America, and family was directed brilliantly. The statue of liberty scene is a classic. Pacino, De Niro, and the rest of the cast creates a film energy which is captive for the audience. Pacino's mod boss role shines with strength, dishonesty, and cleverness. The 'senator we are all part of the same hypocrisy' resonates what the film is about. De Niro aka Vito brilliants acts out a story of a man pushed into crime who is a ruthless killer, and also plays with his children. De Niro's dualism creates ironic realism of the Vito character. The Godfather Part two sub stories of betrayal, honor, dishonor, corruption, and the damage of the characters' sin is a story which leaves an impact. A long movie, with painful scenes, but worth an Academy award.",9,0,1,23 March 2016

Noash the handler and the CIA director are the evil characters, while Nicky and others can not handle the guilt of the job, having a human side. The evil vs good premise is Bourne's personality. Bourne lives with his guilt as an assassin, but can still be a heartless machine. Ever scene Bourne is vigilant, alert, and thinking. Bourne is intelligently tactical he does one thing as subterfuge, while accomplishing another. Add in spectacular car chases, chases, and fights we have a great movie. 9 out of 10 Bourne mercy, and kindness saves his life in the end.",9,2,4,7 August 2007
Rush," Seven out of ten
","Rush is a well acted, directed movie with a great story. Helmsworth has a strong performance as a Flamboyant race car driver. Ron Howard, directs a perfect story of the clashing professional race car drivers Hunt and Lauda. Hunt is a reckless and flamboyant personality, while Lauda has an arrogant and anal retentive personality. The personality clash creates an intense rivalry. (The irony of the story is both characters have huge egos,push limits and left wealthy families with promising futures.) Each action of Hunt and Lauda pushes the other driver to be better. The crux of Rush's story is an accident and how the two main characters react to the horrific event. The pressure of racing is the minor part of the movie! The real story is about people and how their personalities interact.",7,1,4,2 October 2013
Predator," Arnold bounces back from Raw Deal
","After the huge disappointment with Raw Deal, a fresh new idea came to action films.  An alien that hunts humans for sport.  Carl Weather (Appolo in Rocky) teams up with Arnold in this action adventure.  Arnold is such a good physical actor that in the end with his Conan scream make this film a thriller.  A director does not need much dialogue in a script when the visual is considered more important.  The direction in this does not need it.  This film will hunt you down, and I give it an 8.",8,1,2,10 March 2002
Nightcrawler," Nightcrawler is okay but disturbed.
","Nightcrawler is okay but disturbed. Nightcrawler is about a profession where the characters chase police scanners and record news. Nightcrawler creates a persona where people make money off other people's misery. Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of a sociopath is excellent. Narcissistic, lacking empathy, unable to relate with other people, and only able to think in terms of himself is Gyllenhaal's character. Gyllenhaal obstructs justice, and manufactures news which creates a disturbed character who will go to any extreme to succeed. One needs to take a bath after watching Gyllenhaal's performance. Well directed and performed. Nightcrawler is not for the faint of heart. 7 out of 10 ambulances. I would not buy this movie!",7,1,3,8 November 2014
The Aviator," What a surprise!

After watching the director and lead actor before I wonder why they ever would work together again. I was wrong, there is a chemistry the 2 have together. Great acting and directing. The movie does not seem to be the 2 hours that the movie is. Hugh's phobia towards germs is never explained. Can a phobia ever be explained? Alan Alda is great! Nice to see Alda in a different role. The Avaiator shows that graph and politicts have not changed over the years. Worth watching. I give Aviator a 8 out of 10. The movie show's Hugh's as a risk taker.",8,0,0,16 March 2005
Oblivion," Tom Cruse has two hits in a row!
","Tom Cruse has two hits in a row. Jack Reecher and Oblivion are two surprise hits for the fading star. Tom Cruse's plays the Alpha male role in both films. What I liked about Oblivion is the script keeps changing, as the plot twists intrigues the viewer. Is Jack the man he thinks he is? Jacks orders and perceptions are questioned? Oblivion's themes of what reality is, and our perceptions of truth and that the truth can be manipulated by the information we receive work well with Oblivion's script. I love how Morgan Freeman introduces the theory of the way to kill an idea is to replace the idea with an other idea. Oblivion surprised and entertained me. I give Oblivion a seven out of ten.",7,0,1,22 April 2013
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Over rated
","Williams runs at the mouth in this over serious comedy.  Rude and crude, and insulting over humorous dialog.  Maybe, Andrew Dice Clay could do better. Over rated, his comic bit, like in a club, sounds more like a tirade at the post office than humor.  No Caddy Shack, with the cholate bar in the pool humor.  Instead, the movie reminds me more of insults at work.  The ending is serious, and one needs to see a comedy after watching this film. 4/10",4,7,23,21 August 2002
The Bourne Identity," perfect weapon
","This film is very European.  It seems that when Europeans do films, the films have more of a darker side to them.  You can tell by the grainy film quality, casting of characters, and locations.  The CIA director was what one would expect a person in this position to be like.  I do not think it was believable that they would have assassins, but if they did would they be that well trained.  Overall, the film was great; the cast was picked out perfectly.  Matt Damon has improved since the  Talented Mr. Ripley.  I could not feel sorry for any of the characters; they all knew what type of game they were playing.  This one is a winner; a must see. 8/10",8,1,2,7 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One long movie
","Spoilers!!!!Well, I remember Mr Capatani used to read us the novels in grade 4.  He took Sean O'Conal, Mike Lazeruk, Bernie Pazaluko, my very good friend Tony Pietrafesa, and myself to the movie.  It was a cartoon, I watched while eating Tony's popcorn, and we thought it was the greatest film since Star Wars.  I loved these stories that were read in class, and looked forward to the movie.  This type of film is usually not my thing.  I was disappointed, not with the movie itself, or characters but the length.  Many scenes should never left the cutting room floor, and the ending leaves you hanging.  I wish they added more to the end, and some from the middle.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, maybe my expectations were too high, they could have erased 45 minutes. 6/10",6,0,1,7 August 2002

The actors where unknown, but the Superman character was believable, while the Lois character was likable but feisty. The directing was fast paced, but slow in spots, mostly flashbacks for character and plot development. There is a biblical themed sub plots: The Clark character living on the earth but not of it.

Cast Away," reminds me of the movie hell in the Pacific
","Warning a bit of a spoiler don't read. Tom Hanks plays a stranded Fed Ex boss on a Island.  The movie shows the contrast between his busy every second counts life, to the very mundane what time is it life on the island.  In fact the push against the clock pushes him onto the plane and into the upcoming events.  The choices his jobs requires changes plans which effects his personal life.  I can relate well with this for my job and many other peoples job do this daily.  On the Island there is very little dialog, but the viewer follows the story by his actions, very simular to the movie 'Hell in the Pacific' with Lee Marven.  He make the choice to leave the island or go insane, the twist in the story is what happenens to the environment he left 4 years ago.  The movie ends quite nicly with him at a cross roads on a highway, which symbolizes the cross roads in his life.  A good film, fresh, and a story that you could see once, and any remake would be very redunant",7,0,0,29 December 2000
The Thing," Great movie
","'Any where but here?'  Is a line Kurt Russel says in this film.  It is such a good film. I can watch it 20 times and never tier of it.  You will stay glued to the set with this story, and when the people monster out you will jump out of your seat.  Russel character is a role model for myself.  He is not a wimpy, politically correct 90's guy; who's into his own feelings, but a sarcastic,realist who is a hard drinking and toughf.  Somone you would need in a situation like this.  The suporting cast is just a good.  Your typical group of guys with faults and different personalities, that would act stressed out in these situations.  The plot makes alot of sence and is truly scary.  Nice to see a believable film with real type people in it. Not your typical perfect hollywood types who a 2 dimentional story.",8,3,9,22 December 1999
Armageddon," A solid 6
","Spoiler This film is a solid six, not a little less or a little more.  I know this is not a serious movie, but it is a bit lame.  Steve, (Mr Pink) I can not spell his last name is great comic relief, especially with his space what ever you call it he got.  Bruce Willis did his best considering the script.  Anyway, if  a meteor nearly miss the Earth it rips away the earths atmosphere, I know I am picky, but that is a technical glitch with the ending.  The story drags in parts, but its not a bad second feature at the drive in.",6,0,3,14 August 2001
The Village," Disapointment
","Boy,it is hard to make a post, with my firewall going up all the time some jerk must be trying to hack me.  Anyways, that is besides the point.  The guy who wrote and directed this film, I believe it is an East Indian name that I can't spell, has a bad tendency of writing films that have great previews, but disappointing endings with no conclusions.  Another film like signs.  The story dragged, and the characters were over evolved.  This would be a great short story, but not a full feature film.  The movie is plausible.  Maybe, they should have an aftermath at the end of this film. Like Signs were the aliens could not open doors, but travel from another planet the Village is another hard too digest film.  A DVD at home not a outing. 6 out of 10.",6,1,2,1 August 2004
21," 21 is a 19 out of 21.
","21 is a 19 out of 21. The movie 21 has a compelling story, which is well acted, and directed. I love watching well executed movies. Will the protagonist get his money for college? Is the professor an evil man? How evil is the security firm? These questions and more will be answered in the next couple of hours when viewing 21. I enjoy watching Kevin Spacey who always plays a good creepy role. The only part I hated about the movie was when the pizza delivery guy interrupted the flick! When does it take a hour to get a pizza, when the place is 10 minutes from my house. Well, that is besides the point. Worth downloading on payperview! Payperview is cool and way cheaper than video rentals. I did not even have to take the movie back. Worth seeing on payperview. 21 is a 19 out of 21 or in IMDb terms a 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,3 September 2008
The Revenant," A good movie but over hyped!
","A good movie, but over hyped. If not for all the hype, I would say The Revenant is a solid movie. A break from Hollywood's political correct narrative where the storyline is black and white. With characters and groups are all evil or all good, The Revenant is a grey storyline clouded with the premise of what really happened! As it is in the wild, nomadically running around the social contract, and rule of law diminish into natural law. The law of nature where if one goes hungry if the hunt does not go well, you could be the one hunted. One could even understand the brute, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), was trying to survive as a cunning animal. The bear was trying to protect her cubs. The Revenant tries to show the brutality of nature. Would not be to quick in urban society if there were food shortages,people would revert back to 150 to 200 hundred years ago. The Revenant accurately creates the good and evil of people in a desperate experience. 7 out of 10",7,1,4,17 January 2016
The Hills Have Eyes," Preview better than movie
","Do not rent this dog of a movie, the preview is a lie. No suspense, or real character development. The movie insults the viewer's intelligence, I know it is only a movie, but people get shot with no effect, can rip dogs apart etc I find the movie crosses over into stupid land. The family was unlikeable with the swearing, and over top behaviour. I find the mutants, like the one at the end that gets shown too many times way too much. I work at the post office and find weirdos more annoying than scary. The movie tries to shock or gross one out, maybe the movie will make the viewer feel unpleasant, but not scare him or her. The only part I like were the beautiful dogs, but the rest of the film is a weirdo fantasy not a story style of film. 3 0ut of 10. Not even worth a second feature on rental night.",3,0,2,24 June 2006
Knowing," Ending was awful.
","knowing was OK. The first 3rd was OK. Who were these people? What was with the predictions? Did Cage lose his mind? These subplots made for an interesting story for the first two thirds of the story. However, the ending is so stupid. 1 hour build up for this ending! No thanks! The story needs a rewrite. The ending is the most depressing I have seen in years. Everyone dies. We all get fried by a solar burst. Why was there no high winds at the end? For those who know astronomy that would be a good question. Six out of ten. I would not even rent this movie. The movie was not bad; I can name many worse movies. However I found the move too out there, and the ending way too depressing.",6,1,3,5 April 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Best movie so far this summer!
","Spoilers!!  The original is a classic that I have seen one too many times, which made Arnold.  The second film, left its science fiction roots, and became a special effects film, without much of a story. A lot of films have plot holes, but how could John Conners exist without the first film happening. No bratty kid, social cause and effects(ie the security guard why don't I kill, the science guy change of mind), Linda Hamilton giving a PC social lecture, and effects with no need like the truck scene.  T3 had to change from the first 2, and this makes it a strong film. The over the top action scenes add humor for the film.  Arnold acts more like a machine, and becomes a strong secondary character; smart move for Arnold.  It shows he can step back for the good of the film. Arnold's computer behavior is comical!  Most science fiction has philosophy, and this film deals with fatalism.  This film answers the question why does John Conner exist.  As a result of fate, the second film only delayed the inevitable.  One must deal with their fate. Chaos theory with free will creates order to chaos and events unfold.  The strongest part of this film is the believability with the science fiction. In 1984, Sky Net takes over, was science fiction, but with the net, and the grid cyber war, it is possible.  This would damage the financial, power, communications system etc.  I watched a show about cyber war on the Learning Channel, with what the  NSC could do and with Sky net and the virus it is plausible.  Add the sci-fi, time travel and anything is possible.  The ending is mind blowing with fatalism.  7 or 8 out 10.",7,0,1,6 July 2003
U-571," Entertaining
","This film is ok, and Bill Paxton plays a good role.  However, this film steered away from the facts.  The explosions were too close, it was the British who actually did this mission, and the story gets a little too unbelievable. There is tension, drama, and a message of what a good leader is.  These attributes save an otherwise unbelievable film.",6,1,2,13 May 2001
The Shining," Red Rum
","This is a very good movie, but not great.  The tention build up from the beginning is great.  Especially when the car is driving up to the outlook, it shows isolation an over all theme of this movie, and the music is very creepy.  Jack played a very himself type of roll.  I could see how one could go mad with just his fammily, imagine you and your mother stuck in isolation for 6 months.  Well anyways, it is scary and holds your attention, but its no end all of a movie.  Everyone I know has barrowed my copy of this classic, and loved it.  Maybe its just me.",7,1,5,16 December 1999
American Beauty," My wife called it a stupid movie
","I agree with her, and after the hype is over no one will remember this film 3 years from now.  It will drop from the #2 spot within time, trust me.  Had some sort of political message, try to figure it out but more weird then anything else. It's about mid-life crisics, and how one individual relives his youth inorder to escape the rut of his personal, and work life.",3,3,8,23 May 2000
American Beauty," Don't beleiave the hipe
","This movie is nothing special, just very weired.  Maybe, it reflects the depressing times we live in.  How messed up people are, and the phoney masks they wear in there every day lives.  Well, the problem with this film is the lack of direction or point, well there is a point but it's very hidden.  The theme in this film is what one man acts outs when he is tired of these phoney games, and just does not care anymore.",3,1,2,17 March 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," This movie is awful
","Spoiler Big budget, special affects, etc. where great, but this movie has no story.  1. How could John Conners be born if they erased all the future events. 2. Watch Linda Hamalton run around like some 60's activist, not real. 3. The black sciencetist who suddenly decides to help them with Skynet, how sappy, and kills himself. 4.  The kid in the movie is annoying, you wish the Terminator got him. 5. If Skynet did not invent the chip it would have never existed. This story is too melodramatic that it kills the science fiction end, and creates some sappy feel good movie.  Not for me, or any science fiction fan.",3,9,39,11 March 2002
Heartbreak Ridge," Eastwood makes this film or it would break
","This film would be forgettable, if not for Eastwoods performance.  Eastwood is a strong actor, and the character he plays is made for this film.  Its funny, exciting, and very military.  Peebles, and one the combat scenes is too over the top.  I guess this is for contrast in the film.  I will enjoy watching this film a second time, and give it a 7 out of 10",7,4,8,11 April 2002
The Patriot," A solid 7
","I read the news paper review in the Winnipeg Free Press, and the guy chopped the movie down.  I decided to take my wife out anyways, because the reporter started to run anti American diatribe and would hate the movie regardless.  The journalist should learn some professionalism, because the movie was not that bad.  I gave it a solid 7 and I would probably have to see it a second time to pick up details I missed the first time, and probably like the movie even more.  Gibson is such a good actor, his accent helps in this film to give it realism.  Gibson is the type of actor whos physical gestures can really make a seen. It has great villains, family, revenge, and historical perspective that makes the movie believable.  The comeback of the historical epic is a nice change from your by the numbers, humdrum, action flicks.  This film will shock you, inspire you, and make you laugh.  My wife cried during one of the scenes, and if a movie can do that to a person, I think its worth the $8.50.",7,2,3,29 June 2000
Van Helsing," Just Ok
","A bit too fantasy, but a few good tributes.  There is some homage to a couple of Frankenstien movies, and Christopher Lee vampier movies.  I did not mind some of this film, and some of the story, but this movie gets dorkey like Harry Ptter, The Matrix, and Lord of the Rings.  I like the pace of this film, very fast like the Dawn of the Dead remake. When I compare Van Helsing to the Dawn remake the story becomes fantasy/dork and lose a bit of the grit or realism that scares me from the Dawn of the Dead or Chainsaw remake.  This is a good rental, but a little too over explained story line. Should of keep one guessing, and a little more nastier, instead of shocking. Remind me of the Batman movie, I mean Batman one from 89.  The effects were ok.  Too many by the number type film out like this, but better than others 6 out of 10",6,2,3,14 May 2004
Divergent," Entertaining movie
","Divergent is an entertaining movie for the following reasons: Divergent is well directed and acted. The director and actors create a balanced mix of drama and mystery. The science fiction story about sectors in society and group order to create peace is watchable. Divergent's sets, back grounds and supporting actors create a good back ground environment. There is a teenage female lead telling the story. The Young female lead who is attracted to the kind but strong male. A potential romance? The film is geared for the Young Female Twilight or Hunger Games audiences. If you can stomach the genre Divergent is not a bad movie. Seven out of ten.",7,4,12,28 March 2014

Ivan Drago is portrayed as what the Soviet system can create, and Rocky a symbol of American grit has to defend the American way, and correct a personal mistake.  This film is directed so well that it gets my blood pumping, the fight scenes, and personal dialogue is incredible.

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The series just gets stronger!
","The series gets stronger with each new installment. I have watched the Mission Impossible series and the scripts, stunts and story lines improves as the series budget increases with each new movie.. What worked: Rogue Nation had all the elements of a great movie: Stunts, great locations and well executed action sequences. The new added nemesis, and a counter organization added new twists which made the Hunt character look vulnerable. Deception, adaptation, and manipulation were the counter themes which made the Hunt character and his crew shine and created a story with plot twists making the viewer wanting more. What did not work: Not much, and I found the twist at the ending with Baldwin, and Renner had me laughing.",7,1,4,4 August 2015
Spider-Man," This one is a winner!
","This is the best comic character since Batman.  In fact, I liked this a lot better than Batman.  It did not have any slow spots.  The acting was well and the characters fitted the comic book characters to a tee.  I can not wait for the sequel.  I wonder who the villain will be.  The special affects were good, but you could tell some was computer graphics.  A must see. 10/10",10,9,14,3 May 2002
Jarhead," One of the better films this year
","One of the better films this year. Not anti war or pro war, but done in a auto-biography style. I personally like films which show events as is! The Over There show is anti-war, and drama story, I find when a story is too political, there is a dilution of the story. The story lacks when the realism does not happen; I am sure bad events happen during war. Jarhead shows the causes, boredom, stress, and stupidity, which happens with the human factor, and different personalities. The movie also shows the positive and the Spartan of marine life. I find the irony or duality of the movie is the character who is the decent, most level headed guy; the glue of the squad is the soldier which will be dishonorably discharged from the corp. Even the level headed soldier unglued when ordered or cheated out of the chance for a enemy kill. Why? For all the training, and build up there was no release, and the event became overwhelming for the individual. 9 out of 10. Big budget.",9,2,6,9 November 2005
Collateral," Miami Vice meets Tom Cruse via Hitchcock
","The story is very strong, and has the Michael Mann 'You belong to the city' feel for it.  Tom Cruse is the lesser of two lead actors in order to fit the role of Vincent.  Tom, if I can call him that like I really know him, is a high mileage actor.  Tom is good at his trade, but after using up similar characters over the years needed to re-invent the Tom Cruse persona.  Maybe, next movie one might see an even darker Tom; (AKA a Nazi in a war movie, or as a evil spirit in a haunted house)only Tom will know.  'Collateral' has a Miami Vice or Heat feel that mixes a Alf Hichcock story with plot twists to it.  A great date movie, when I was 17 or 21 and dating say my wife, as the girl friend of course, this movie would be great.  Too be fair I need to watch this movie another time to give it a accurate rating, but I would tell everyone to go see it at the Drive In or Theater before Collateral is ready for on demand or DVD rental.  7 or 8 out of 10.  Tom email me and tell me what your going do next I am excited.",7,0,3,8 August 2004
Dunkirk," Best movie for 2017, but 2017 is a weak year for movies
","One of the most important retreats in WW 2 is recreated with the movie Dunkirk. What worked: Big cast, lots of extras, big budgets makes for a believable film. The dialog, characters portrayals are believable. Excellent portrayal of the order and discipline of the British military. A retreating army was not in panic and the a calm orderly public which with pleasure craft saved an army. What did not work: Dunkirk has many macro scenes and characters which creates a plethora of too much information. The viewer is overwhelmed. What makes Dunkirk's filming style confusing is the story flips back and forth from different character and events in time sequences. I am usually good at following complex story lines but Dunkirk had me lost in a few parts. Dunkirk had the potential to be a epic movie, but fizzles out because of poor editing. Six out of ten stars. Could have been like a epic 70's war movie.",6,3,7,10 August 2017
Ratatouille," Good animated film!
","My wife loves animated films. She thought the rat looked cute. The story's theme of the rat rising above his station of life is motivating. Reme, the rat, like foods and wants to create instead of stealing food. Linguini is controlled by Reme and the fun beginning with Linguini being comic relief. The French atmosphere is nice. One will notice many big name voices in the movie. Brian Dennehey and James Remar are heard. Peter O'toole is the voice of the food critic. The underdog theme of many children tales is well done. One cannot help but cheer for Reme and Linguini, who play the 2 lost characters. 8 out of 10. Buy the DVD, I know my wife will.",8,2,4,3 July 2007
Bad Teacher," It had a few good laughs!
","A solid six out of ten. Bad Teacher has a few good laughs. Many of the jokes are inside teaching jokes. Spending a few years in the teaching program I noticed the movie portrays many of the teaching stereotypes. The know it all backstabbing, perfectionist teacher, the principal who does not want to deal with all the backstabbing little people games, weirdo intellectuals, overachieving students, over emotional students etc. I get a laugh out of how the movie plays these stereotypes with, drugs, black mail, theft etc and turns the system on its head. Funny movie which shows how much of the profession is full of crap meetings, fakeness, phoney teacher statements etc, which I happened to notice my self. The movie is no Caddy Shack or Happy Gilmore, but worth watching.",6,1,7,7 July 2011

I am tired of comic book movies. The comic book movie has become the seen it done it before with the same old C G I effects. However, I went to see the Amazing Spider-Man because people keep saying Mike you got to see this film. After avoiding Spider-man over the summer I finally saw it. What a great film. Spider-Man is a great film because the movie is excellently direct were the old story is excellent told with new twists. The actors blend the character development into the story perfectly. Martin Sheen played a perfect Uncle Ben. The 3 D effect added to the C G I and give a new excitement to the usual special effects. The same old story told in a better way.

The Fast and the Furious," Great preview = bad movie
","When I saw the preview I thought it should be a great car movie.  Problem is the preview looks great, but the movie is awful.  There is a couple of good scenes in the movie, one involving a truck, and the other which I saw on the preview.  Give me a L and a, and a m and a e and you got lame. This film is so lame if it were a dog they would shoot it. The casting is terrible, all the thieves look like they came out of a boy band.  No one could hijack a truck the way they do it  with out every member being squashed.  Hey, a small Honda is not my fantasy racing machine.  Maybe people shoot lower for what they expect in a car.  The lead girl in the film looks homely. Watching a car on nitro go in a straight line does not excite me into believing that is great driving.  I see that everyday next to the highway I live by.  Except for two stunts in the film there is no furious car chasing in this film.  The script is a bunch of situational scenes put together with no overall story to tie the film together.  This film is so bad its not worth renting.",3,2,5,26 June 2001
The Exorcist," Get me thinking
","Finally, I watched this movie in it entirety.  This movie made me think about what is evil?  Evil is vile, upsetting, and destructive. The movie showed this.  The ending could have more than what it did.  Not much bothers me, after what I have seen; Working at the post office I have seen vile, upsetting, and destructive behavior.  I wonder if some of that behavior could be the results of demonic influence?  Evil must be the free will choice of good.  The viewer sees the absences of good in this movie.  Hate and hate for God, I have seen too much of these destructive habit and this movie portrays evils attack on good in its true nature. 7/10",7,2,3,17 August 2004
Goon," Entertaining but not great!
","Entertaining but not great! The comedy part of the movie was so so, but the hockey part was excellent. Some of the comedy is just too crude, like someone is trying to hard too be funny. The goon's best friend is one of those guys who tries way too hard and one would wish he just would shut up! The guy you hate sitting beside in a restaurant, and character you wished they omitted from the movie. However, there were some funny scenes. The hockey part was excellent. One sees the pressures on the players and what is expected from the hockey profession. How everyone on the team plays his part, and the goon creates the open ice for the star player. Liev Schrieber plays the best character in the movie as the rival goon, who throws the other team off their game. The movie is filmed in my hometown of Winnipeg and I noticed many sites like the MTS centre, the exchange district, and Keleckies. I give the film six out of ten.",6,4,11,2 March 2012
Pearl Harbor," Romance/ War movie
","The first hour of the film is romance/relationships, and the war, madly, interrupts this.  My wife deeply enjoyed the romance part, and I found it much better than the Titanic's love story.  Then there is a few good plot twists, and my part of the movie begins with the Pearl Harbor attack.  The attack is well done, and I found it very realistic.  Then the movie mixes the romance and the war together for the conclusion.   I gave it an 8, it would be higher, but I wish they expanded a bit more of the historical events leading up to the attack.  This movie is fairly flawless.",8,1,4,27 May 2001
The Conjuring 2," Another haunting story.
","The Conjuring 2 is similar to The Conjuring. Another story about a haunting which the Warren's investigate basically a remix of the first installment. The different characters create a rapport which connects with the audience. James Wan (the director) creates a slow build up where the viewer always feels on edge for what is next to happen. Similar to other ghost stories! The usual over dramatic, over the top scares, which makes one wonder about fraud. I roll my eyes with skepticism with haunting stories. I still do not understand why they would store the cursed objects in their own house. I do not care that they lock the door, it is still too close for comfort. Creepy sets, and ghosts, but the ending is just too much to take. The Conjuring 2 is 7 out of ten stars.",7,0,1,24 June 2016
Die Hard 2," Better than the first, but I do not like the series.
","They try and make Ollie North look bad in this one.  The film is entertaining, but I do not like the series.  I do not know if it is Bruce Willis, or the PC hobnogen, but the films appear tired.  Good action scenes, and interesting fights, but I would say Under Seige 2 is a much better comparable film.  Watchable 6/10",6,3,6,30 October 2002
Resident Evil," Knock off of Dawn of the Dead!
","Spoiler Zombie movies, what can one say, I can only describe them as zombie movies.  It begain ok, but the special forces actors where too much.  When one acts too over macho one looks like a wantabe. The million dollar question is if the virius only effects the dead why did the computer kill everyone. I keeped asking myself that question through out the movie!  The films ending is interesting, but why do the zombie's always take over the earth.  Worth renting 6/10",6,0,1,20 August 2002

I might be wrong, but this movie will not age well.",5,2,7,2 July 2001
Quantum of Solace," Not bad not good.
","Quantum of Solace is not a bad movie or a good movie. The movie is a mix of the older Sean Connery James Bond movies and The Jason Bourne movies. The action is identical to the Jason Bourne movies. On a personal note, I like the Bourne movies better. Quatum of Solace is only a 1 and a half hour movie. A little too short for my taste. I heard the reason for the short running time was the last Bond movie would be too long and the 1 and a half hour movie Quantum of Solace is the continuation the last Bond story. The movie is based off the book Casion Royal and books usually make for long movies. Craig, the new Bond lacks the humor of the older Bonds, a part which is needed to relieve the intents action of the films. I give Quantum of Solace 6 out of 10 Spies. OK to go out and see, even better to rent.",6,4,8,18 November 2008
Independence Day," Watchable but sad
","This film could have been much more than the unimaginative generic PC crap that comes out of Hollywood.   They do not use the nuke on the invaders until half way through the movie.  Is the president slow or what, and the advisor that makes sense gets blasted.  Area whatever, the ugly Aliens, Will Smith's stripper girlfriend, and Jeff Goldblum's dad was too sappy.  There really was no magic, mystery, and strange science fiction in this film. They could have done a lot better than this. 5/10",5,0,2,17 September 2002
The Dirty Dozen," Stupid movie
",I found this movie stupid.  For one thing they has a black man disguised as a Nazi;  I do not think this accurate.  The plan of using death row inmates to do a deadly mission is too unreliable.  The few that managed to escape is unbelievable; Rambo is more believable that this.  The only good thing in this film was Lee Marvin. Not worth watching. 4/10,4,7,23,30 May 2002
No Country for Old Men," Not bad, but could have been a better ending
","I believe the movie is about the randomness of life. All the random events, and choices lead to each character's fate. Order through chaos is the movies theme! That is why the antagonist flips a coin, and gives people the choice of head or tails. The coin toss reflects fate and fates effect by choices one makes out of free will. That is why the antagonist went after the other characters wife, even when there was no reason for it, because the antagonist gave the character the choice to come in or his wife will die. The movie is interesting, and the story is good. I like how the two characters who let's call trouble shooter are disjointed with the world. Good at what they do, but are a Little out of touch. Just like this movie. 7 out of 10. A good rental. Maybe that is why the ending is so disjointed.",7,0,6,5 December 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Yuk... I hated this film
","Yuk...... I hated this film. I know this movie is supposed to be sad. Ford's life was one of a guy who killed someone he befriended, and in a dirty way. I wonder why Ford thought people would think his action would be one of a hero. The lighting is dim and entwined with depressing dialog, which makes for ickey and messy film. The directing and script creates the mess of a life these people endured. Plays where Ford reenacted the sick deed of shooting Jessie in the back is painful to watch. Jessie and the clan were negative towards one another displayed in their self centered paranoid criminal lives. Gut wrenching too watch. What comes around goes around is the enduring theme for the viewers to watch. So enduring I fell asleep for twenty minutes during the film. Too enduring for me especially during a cold Drury Febrauary day. I give this film a 2 out of 10. Like watching a slow train wreck of Ford's life. The end is ironic.",2,4,15,29 February 2008
Tigerland," Fresh, and gritty
","This movie is done on a low budget.  It looks like they used the actual government training center, and many parts were realistic.  A few parts of the movie were over the top.  This movie is fresh, and gritty; I like the realism of the film.  The hero or anti hero is a nice guy, in wolf's skin. (I've met people like him) It shows how cruel the system can be and the merits of playing by your own rules.  In the end I like this film.",7,9,17,3 July 2001

","I like this movie.  It has car racing, conflict, romance, and a driven character.  This film gets one's heart racing.  If you like auto racing, this movie gets across as phoney; no one bumps into another car at those high speeds.  A driver would get killed!  In conclusion, this movie is worth renting; $3.99 well spent.",7,6,12,9 August 2001
Batman Begins," Strong start
","Strong start of the film, but ends like all the other comic movies. I like the beginning of the movie. Who Bruce Wayne is. Why Bruce is scared of Bats! How Bruce becomes Batman. The theme of when you go out to chase monsters, do not become one yourself is powerful. However, I hate using this metaphor, the ending is the same done it, did it before big climax. The formula has a change to it, but I believe the makers were looking for a different ending but could not just achieve such a ending. The epilogue at the ending leaves room for another film. I like the epilogue discussion of evolution and action and reaction. A thinking man's batman. I would wait for the movie on pay for view. 7 out of 10. I did not like Katie Holmes, even with her small row for Batman. I can not reason why.",7,0,3,11 July 2005
Twilight," My wife loves this movie!
","My wife loves this movie! She thinks this is the best movie of the year. Her friend Misty agree but her husband does not. Hey, I thought the movie was OK. Geared for the romance female audience with a vampire twist. Lot's of junior high school gals in the theater for this film. You can guess how they marketed this film and for who. She, me wife, says the movie was romantic, suspenseful with a great storyline. I mention there was no Chuck Norris in the film. Maybe, Chuck could have added to the film, but my wife said no. Great date movie. I would give this film an 8 out of 10 for date night. Date night is cool so Twlight is a cool film to bring that date too.",8,1,8,26 December 2008
Non-Stop," Non-Stop pounding of the senses.
","Non-Stop assault of the senses. Liam Neeson has another strong performance as a harden and jaded character. There is terrorism on a air flight if a $150 000 0000 ransom is not paid which will result in a passenger's death every 20 minutes. Air marshal Neeson must stop the plot. Non-Stop script and Neeson's ability to create intense moments causes a back and forth tension for the viewers. The viewer experiences excitement then calm. Non-Stop push the viewer into one direction and then teases the viewer into another possibility. I could never guess who was behind the plot/frame up. The climax surprises and entices the movie experience. A well directed, acted, and executed movie. Non-Stop is an eight out of ten.",8,1,4,4 March 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Seen it before.
","This is a great movie if you did not see WW II movies before.  I have and this film is unoriginal.  It is not that bad, except the part with the Jewish American fighting with the German over the knife.  I never seen and American lose the knife strugle before in a movie.  I guess that is why they do not make TJ Hooker shows anymore they have been so over done, who would watch.  In the end I like Hanks but that is about it. 4/10",4,6,13,22 July 2002
The Transporter," Like a 70's Hong Kong action flick!
","This movie is comparable to an 80's Chuck Norris film, or many of Bruce Lee's films.  I would not call it bad action wise, but not good story wise. I thought it would be like The Driver, but it evolves into Bradock Missing in Action,and then into a remake of Return of the Dragon.  Entertaining and gets rid of anger, which I needed to vent out yesterday, but I kept saying to myself you got to be kidding with some of the story.  Go see it if you like martial arts, and rocket attacks.  Notice the heat seeker goes after the warm oven, I appreciate that detail.  I give it a six out of ten.",6,0,1,17 October 2002
Seabiscuit," Believe the hype
","For once a film lives up to the hype.  I found this story interesting, and believable.  True stories grab my attention more than the made up ones.  I wonder how close the movie is too the facts, considering time restraints, and drama.  I never wanted to see this, but we borrowed the DVD from my sister and I was glued to the TV.  It even has a not too dragged out social message.  The actors look the part.  All the horse race action is done well. This movie reminds me of going to the track with my dad.  Sometimes you have to take chances in life!  In the end, I guess we must all keep moving on like the Seabiscuit in life.7 or 8 out of 10",7,0,0,15 April 2004
28 Days Later...," I liked it, and my wife hated it!
","Spoilers. I must give the British credit, for they know how to stretch a budget to its limits. My wife noticed the mansion they used was from the movie 'a bridge too far'.  Anyway she hated this film, found it boring and would give it a 3.  Myself, I found this movie entertaining.  Forget about the science fiction premise, this movie is about the human condition and the effects of stress on it.  My father says do gooders usually have the best intentions, but think with emotion instead of logic.  This is the premise of what causes the end of civilized England, the story at the end gives clues that the island nation contained the virus, and stopped it.  I love the thinking in this film especially the cute comment about eradiated food.  Working at the post office I see daily how stress, desperation, and stupidity play on the human condition.  The part where the survivors find the soldiers (not special forces but normal people) and what stress would do is accurate.  Bad situations test peoples' character and brings the worst out.  I believe the major had good intentions to begin with, trying to bring women in for his men, but creates a solution more terrible than the problem.  Not enough women and TOO MANY MEN.  I believe if the hero was not there to fight with them, then the soldiers would of started fighting with each other.  Bars try to keep the ratio even, the Antarctic station banned women for fear of love triangles, and when it was lifted they had a murder love triangle afterwards.  This film exploits this premise believably.  People fighting over the leftovers.  In the end, the film shows the virus only takes out our darker emotions of the infected when situations bring us into a rage.  I give it 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,7 July 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," Long Movie
","This is a long movie, in fact this movie is so long when my dad Watched this movie, in 1962, at the drive-in the sun started to rise.   Its a real life story from a book, and I find real life more interesting then fiction.  We do not no if Lawrence went mad, or was brilliant.  The story is entertaining, and the film ages well.  The acting is exceptional, other older films acting appears hackish or cornballish.  This film is a bit long, and I watched it over 2 days; furthermore I thought the war scenes would be bigger, a little disapointed with that.  In the end it a good movie and I gave it a 7.",7,1,8,29 June 2001
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," one very good movie!
","One very good movie! The movie is well cast, acted, and directed, but what really makes this movie good is the story. The story is well researched with how primates act. They defend their tribe,their young, and work in social groups. The movie shows how people behave like animals by fear, and intimidation. The movie adds aspects like gene therapy, and the use of viruses in medicines. The movie also shows when proper medical procedures are not used the world could face a pandemic. I love the movie's details where people in the airline industry make perfect incubators. The movie sets up part two perfectly. The apes rise and a pandemic faces humanity makes a great story. The details that the director and actors performance in the film was amazing. The character who has Alzheimer's disease plays the role painfully perfect. I found it hard to watch. The idea of the nasty airline pilot because of stress, being away from home, disrupted sleep patterns were great layering for a strong story. I will not ruin the story for you, but one might have to watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes a few times to appreciate this film. I give Rise of the Planet of the Apes eight out ten.",Null,2,6,12 August 2011
JFK," Gad will this film ever end
","It's too long, and stupid.  It could have been a comedy with that scene with Joe Pesci being whipped.  How could he have a straight face while filming that scene.  Funny part John Candy plays the only believable straight role in this film.  I did fall asleep before this one ended.  No before you ask, I am not with the government, who is trying to spread some misinformation! I do not know what's with Oliver Stone, but after this, and some of the scenes from Any Given Sunday and Nixon I am surprised this guy doesn't do a film on UFO's. 5/10",5,11,29,12 August 2002
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Surprise of the summer!
","Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood was either going be awful or great. No in between for Tarantino's latest. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood works for it is a buddy movie mixed in with Hollywood tales and experiences. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood submerges the viewer into 1969 Hollywood, full of elitists, cults, clicks and the Hollywood crowd. The viewers learns about Rick Dalton's acting woes, syndication problems, and personal acting problems. A producers guides Dalton and we see the change in movie Westerns from 50's to Italian westerns to the more gritter Westerns of the late 60's. Dalton craps on in is a needy character for the Cliff Booth character. (aka Dalton's personal stunt double) What we learn from the relationship from the stuntman's perspective that Booth finds the crap in Hollywood is par for him. First the viewer feels bad about the relationship until we find out that Dalton goes to bat for the black listed stuntman. Cliff faults balance out Dalton's fault as the film unfolds. Cliff is a Alpha male tough guy with no fear Navy Seal personality, who gets into many a tall tale. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood gives threw the movie experience a feel for Hollywood and what goes on in the industry, back in the day. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood gives the middle finger to P C Hollywood with it's 60's counterculture vibe with a surprise ending of what if the Manson family and it's countercultureism home invaded the wrong place. Well all I can say is the flame thrower is classic. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is on the edge, pushes the envelope for a anti Hollywood film. This fresh piece of film is the surprise of the summer.",8,10,21,16 August 2019
Gone Girl," A future classic
","Gone Girl is a future classic. Gone Girl will become another Citizen Kane and or Raiders of the lost Ark. All of Gone Girl's characters are believable. Director Fincher creates a narrative of empathy, understanding and dread for the missing woman. Gone Girl's writer brilliantly plays on the viewer's assumptions, and creates a sub story where the media, and public can be fooled by an intelligent, ruthless, vengeful sociopath. The only people who were not fooled was the lowly poor white Southerners, who figured out a con compared to the rich suburbanites; another sub-story about assumptions. The director, and story writer weave together a brilliant/shocking ending, which makes Gone Girl a movie classic. I personally love a story/film where after each scene the viewer is left wanting more! I give Gone Girl a ten out ten.",10,2,15,8 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino shocks again.
","2 out of 3 Tarantino movies are good and 1 out of 3 are duds. Going to see Django with my wife and friend, I thought Dajango was going be either very good or very bad! Dajngo is similar to Inglorious Bastards with over the top violence, surprise killings of characters, and plot twists. Tarantino uses some historical research then changes history! Django has several characters tell their sub-stories into making one big story. Waltz out shines Di Caprio and Foxx in Django as the showman, and mechanical bounty hunter. One learns even Waltz's character even has limits. Di Caprio's character loves his power at the plantation, and the game man ship with Waltz. Foxx is the man on a mission trying to find his lady. The surprise acting performance on par with Waltz is Jackson's. The surprise is how much a impact Jackson had with a small roll. Jackson was (behind Di Caprio) the second most powerful man at the plantation for he knew from the inside how and what the other slaves where planning. Jackson's character loved his power and a few of his comments gave Jackson the same power of a political adviser. Django, like Bastards, ends in a Tarantino style revenge flick, with all the gore too. I give Django an eight out of ten.",8,2,12,1 January 2013
Drive," Drive had a flat tire.
","The movie Drive had a flat tire, and no spare! There are some good scenes in Drive. However, the good aspect of this film could not save it. The aspects of the movie drive were the Retro 1980's G T A Vice City music score. The film was styled with lighting, acting, and some dialogue in a Miami Vice/Scarface style of that era. The car scenes, the few in the film, where good. The bad is when a movie is titled Drive one expects a car film. The car chase scenes where short and anti climatic. I said to myself: What? That is it for the car chase? The film had a nice artistic Michael Mann style acting, sets, visuals, but to much style over substance. The artistic style overwhelmed the movie and bogged down the story. The ending is way to anti climatic. There should have been more. I give drive 5 out of 10.",6,0,6,30 September 2011
Insidious," Take it or leave it!
","Insidious is an interesting movie! The script is well written. Is it a haunted house story? A haunted individual? The movie's story keeps you guessing. I found Insidious' answers to these questions stupid! I thought you have to be kidding. However, the movie's ending was strong. The story is complemented with great acting and directing. The movie had no slow spots or over acting. I would give Insidious an eight out of ten. The movie is worth seeing in the theatre. I would definitely V O D the movie. I did not recognize any of the actors in the movie. The story is fresh but hard to swallow. Astro projecting in one's sleep to another dimension. Unbelievable!",7,0,7,6 April 2011
2012," Why I hate Hollywood movies.
","I could only watch half of 2012 because it was so bad! 2012 is my definition of why I hate Hollywood movies. The Hollywood establishment loves to make statements, and create melodrama. Create a few political statements, and a few sappy emotional messages you have a dragged out and boring Hollywood movie. There is way too many sappy depressing end of the world scenes in this film. Please someone get me the crying towel! Then the rest of the movie is watching C G I which is boring. When C G I came out it was something new but now it is no longer that exciting. One could watch just as good graphics from a video game. I know we are suppose to turn our brains off when we watch this tripe. BUT COME ON! NO Way.... R Vs cannot outrun a volcano, or jump 900 feet. Plane engines stall when they fly through volcanic ash, and when debris/projectiles fly they will kill if you are in the disaster area. Please do yourself a favor and do not watch this. The real disaster is watching this movie. 3 out of 10",3,6,8,6 July 2011
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," 7 out of 10!
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is much different than the short story. Secret life of Walter Mitty starts out slowly with the life is depressing theme. Slave to the grind feel. Ben/Walter Mitty lives in a imaginary world in order to cope with life's struggles. I found the fantasy world way over the top, but one wonders what goes through people minds when who ever is zoned out. Suddenly Walter's life collapses, which is too real and painful to watch. The overly depressing first third of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty I give a 3 out of 10. The middle third of Walter Mitty movies has Walter pushed out of his comfort zone. A mystery must be solved, and will Walter save his job? The adventure starts and the story picks up. Middle third I give 7 out of 10. The bottom third has Mitt learn more about himself and become involved in real life experiences. Solving a mystery and finding himself is the bottom third; I give 10 out of 10. Well directed with great transaction scenes. Walter Mitty is well crafted. Acting has improved over the last 10 years, and the acting is executed perfectly. I average The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a 7 out of 10.",7,1,1,25 September 2017
The Lion King," Not bad!
","Not bad! The Lion King had a good story and pace. The Lion King had family deception, character development mixed in with a story about life. There was some P C headlines (attention grabbing stuff) about racism etc but the movie was tame. I guess the vegan, nature crowd would disagree the nature story about natures order and the food chain. My grand dad who was a game warded would find the story a good education about nature for the kids. Especially the over use part. The story about a boy Lion growing up and finding out the he will become the lion king is a good retelling of home away from home finding home again story. I miss the old school cartoons, but the C G I was okay. The beautiful C G I created great Disney magic. The father son segment was magic. The action ending of good vs evil would be exciting for any kid. 7 stars.",7,3,6,10 August 2019
The Mist," One good movie
","King's books and short stories transfer well to film. The Mist is a story about creturs from another dimension, and peoples reactions to the new dangerous environment. The story is similar to a socialology study, with subplot about people over reacting to extremes. I guess that is why the military is trained to react in a cold, not to panic condition. The characters, become suspicious of one another. Character start blaming one another, becoming judgmental of each person, and start to using violence etc. Well acted and directed. Each scene leave the viewer interested in the next scene. The brutal ending leaves the message about people's breaking points. A tragic ending where the protagonist becoming irrational, and makes a emotional decision. 9 out of 10. Do not miss this film.",9,4,9,28 November 2007
Driven," Stallone's come back movie!
","This is a good film, after the last couple of stinkers Stallone has done, this film puts him back into the grove.  Well written, where the characters go beyond 2 dimensional.  The people in the film have faults, good points, and bad points; in the end they can surprise you.  This film has great action scenes, tension, conflict, and a great German race car driver that my wife thinks portrays my own personality.  In the end I was entertained, thanks Sly, and keep the good work up, if you read this.   Mike",8,1,2,28 April 2001
I Am Legend," Surprisingly good
","A surprisingly good movie. After seeing the movie trailer, I did not know what to think of I am Legend. I though maybe a stinker. A well, directed, and written movie. I am Legend has a few slow spots, but overall has a fast pace. The story keeps the audience's attention, and wanting more with each scene. The flashbacks tell a story within a story. One gains an understanding with the movie's sub-story. A surprise ending. I like the theme about faith, and God's plan. 8 out of 10. Sometimes all we have is faith. This movie reminds me of my job at the post office where I am the only surviving sane person around. Just joking.",8,1,7,28 December 2007
The Bourne Legacy," They took the money and ran!
","They took the money and ran with the name of the Bourne series. The plot was the same predictable chase and try and kill the agent story. The supporting actors are inferior to the other installments in the series. There is no Matt Damon who adds a human element to the series. The locations, directing, and set was done on the cheap/rush. Nothing new with the Bourne Legacy. This installment looks like a non H B O made for T V movie. The Bourne Legacy is okay to watch, but inferior to the Matt Damon installment. I give this movie a 5 or 6 out of ten. They need to try something radically different to fix and continue the Bourne series.",5,4,11,15 August 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," Over Rated
","Film making has improved over the years, and this film is choppy like Death Wish.  Alot of 70's films appear grainy, compared to the work done today. This film dragged, maybe it was the mood I was in, but it dragged.  I found it slow paced, and not over the top. In the end this is just another movie. 5/10",5,11,29,25 July 2002
Unknown," just okay
","Liam Neeson is preforming many Harrison Ford style of serious action, and drama roles. Liam Neeson, I believe is replacing Harrison Ford as Ford gets older. The Unknown is another Harrison Ford style action/drama film. However, even Liam Neeson could not save 'Unknown'. 'Unknown' has a good story, and well acted. There is a but here and the but is the film seemed to be made in a rush and gave a disjointed feel. I was tired when I saw the film, which could affect my view on the film. 'Unknown' could be a film I need to view more than once to appreciate it. I give Unknown a 6 or maybe a 7 out of 10. My wife liked the movie more than I did.",6,0,1,25 June 2011
Gran Torino," A different time
","A good movie about a different time. Walt Kowalski's character is a person from a different time set. I grew up in East Kildonan in Winnipeg and like the movie's portrayal of Detroit. We had many Walt's around. People who called it as they see it. People who never held back. People WHO love to bust other people verbally. Not very politically correct place to live. I got my turn to be verbally busted and people love to see how you can take it and what your worth is. In the end, Walt viewed people by their actions and respect was earned. I think Walt learned a few things about other people in Grand Torino. In the end the right person earned the Gran Torino. I love how they portrayed Walt's own family as a group of self absorbed people who never had time for dad unless they wanted something from him. Too bad we think so much about our selves and not others in today's world.",8,2,6,16 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Best movie of the year so far!
","Best movie of the year so far! The Hurtlocker is about war, and the effects on the individual. Some people experience fear, while others experience a rush. Adrenaline has a the fight or flight effect on people. You can see this effect on the various characters in the movie, and the lead protagonist is hooked on adrenaline. I can see why the movie's protagonist he went back for another tour. The the Hurtlocker's pace is one of heart pounding adrenaline. One gains the feel of combat and bomb defusing from the Hurtlocker. I will give the Hurtlocker an eight out of ten. The Hurtlocker should win a couple of awards. A good movie to buy.",8,4,10,29 July 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Better than I thought!
","Dead Men tell no tales aka Pirates of the Caribbean is better than I thought, but I had low expectations. What worked: The beginning with the over the top bank heist. The vault going through the town. The mystery and magic with the boy, and the attractive women all needing to find Captain Sparrow. Strong acting by the main characters Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Johnny Depp etc. All the main antagonist characters' story-lines collide with wanting revenge with Captain Jack Sparrow. The antagonists' anger creates humor and interest about the flawed character Jack Sparrow. What did not work: The formulated all work together story-line which is getting old. The conclusion ends with the usually C G I special effects which is redundant and predictable. Not the movie of the summer but better than I thought! Entertaining. 7 stars out of ten.",7,1,3,13 June 2017
K-19: The Widowmaker," Not bad, but not great
","After I watched this movie I did not say 'wow this movie blew me away.' This is a good movie, but I have seen it before.  I like submarine movies, and Hunt for Red October and Das Boat create a better feel.  The Russian accents were horrible and the communist angle could be exploited more. The film is exciting, and I like the drama, but it is still a 6 out of 10.",7,1,1,20 July 2002
The Longest Day," Better than Saving Private Ryan!
","Last time I watch this one is the day my Grandfather died, to take my mind off it.  I forgot how well acted, directed, this film is, and what a huge budget.  This shows is an acting documentary, and cuts out the crap.  We did this all for nothing is a great line.  Check out the line up for this movie WoW! I do not tell many people to rent an older black and white film, but even with out color it is better than most. 8/10",8,3,7,14 October 2002
Slap Shot," Dated but funny
","This film helped ruin hockey, most people don't understand that fighting in hockey is usually done to protect the better player from getting hurt form a cheap body check, but enough of the hockey lecture.  I seen this movie too many times, but it still makes one laugh.  Some of the humor is dated, goes back to the 70's, but its still enjoyable too watch.  I love Doctor Hook Mc Craken in this film, he plays a 70's hockey goon perfectly.",7,3,9,29 December 2001
Patton," excellent

Grudge Match," Okay
","Grudge match started out strong with low ball guy humor. De Niro's character is a funny big mouth. Lines like 'I'm healthy I take all my shots! Jack Daniel etc' are hilarious. Again,Stallone plays the quiet character with a past. Stallone is pushed into the fight, after making a video game and De Niro shows up early. The confrontation gets the boxing event rolling. The second half of the film is too much. Like an old joke or a big mouth who is funny at first, Grudge match get old very fast. Robert De Niro's character Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen is an major idiot, jerk etc that you cannot help but hate. You just know McDonnen is going to screw up. For anyone who has been disappointed or annoyed in life will just hate McDonnen. The viewer does not find McDonnen funny or even tragic likable, but sad in a pathetic way. The 2nd half of Grudge Match just kills the movie! First half, I give an eight and the second half I give a two. Grudge Match is a six stars out of ten.",6,0,0,1 August 2016
Transformers," Transformers is just a fun movie to watch!
","Transformers is just a fun movie to watch. The viewer get to relieve his or her childhood. The four great qualities the movie has is (1) great special effects, (2) a 1980's Spielberg feel, (3) Fast pace, and(4)Lots of humor. The special effects were just over the top. The beginning scene were the helicopter transforms at the military base is great. I write no more or ruin the movie. Spielberg has a certain 1980's quality for movies and if the viewer has watched ET, Raiders, or Back to the Futurethey see similarities. A Marty Mc Fly character similarity with the lead protagonist. Michael Bay created a scary fast pace directing similar to The 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Transformers is a surreal film. The section 7 part of the film is hilarious. I love the section 7 agent. The movie is entertaining for both kids and adults. 9 out of 10. I would watch 'Transformers' again.",9,0,2,28 January 2008
Pawn Sacrifice," Intriguing
","Pawn Sacrifice is intriguing. One watches Pawn Sacrifice wanting to know more. The characters of Fisher and Spassasky were believable. The director creates a brilliance of Fisher's unpredictability which stymies the opposition. One is mesmerized by the recurring theme of Fisher's unpredictability. Why? What is he doing? The bizarre and unpredictable actions come to fruition as opponents become unhinged. Fisher's tactics made others fight on Fisher's terms. Were the tactics mental illness or planned? I do not know. . Was the C I A bankrolling Fisher? I speculate, maybe. In the end, we see Fisher's brilliance slowly drive him mad. A exciting movie on what could be a dull and dry topic, chess. 7 out of 10. Liev Schrieber should get a academy nomination for the the role of Spassasky. Liev Schrieber clapping at the greatest chess game ever played shows a love for a game which exceeds politics and personal rivalries was a memorable moment. Worth seeing.",7,5,8,4 October 2015
Men in Black II," Not as good but close to the original
","I loved the dog.  It is a bit shorter than the first; so they began it with a little cartoon.  I thought the cartoon was funny.  I thought we were in the wrong theater.  It was similar to the original with some new twists. There was some humor.  I was glad they used the worm guys again.  The movie showed the character flaws of both characters.  They left room for a part III.  Overall, it was an entertaining film.  7/10",7,1,3,8 July 2002
Lincoln," Movie will win awards, but just okay!
","Lincoln is just an okay movie. Here is the good and the bad of Lincoln. The good: Lincoln had excellent directing, acting, and the sets were outstanding. One experiences the feel of the times for Lincoln. What I experienced from Lincoln is Washington has not changed at all from 1865 to present. The movie is full of political corruption, bribes, trickery, and lies. The bad: The movie should have been called how to get an act passed through congress. Lincoln is a drama with too much dialogue. I thought there was going to battles, and information on the conspiracy and assassination of Lincoln and was disappointed. I thought Lincoln would be closer to Bill O'Reilly's book. Lincoln is a long winded movie, but made well enough just to be okay. I give Lincoln a six out of ten.",6,6,12,7 December 2012
Rules of Engagement," right on
","Spoiler I did not want to go see this film, for I thought it would be a politically correct film, with someone yelling what about the children. Well I was wrong, instead of a preachy film it was a mystery/courtroom drama story, with believable people.  The one part I did not understand was, how could a bunch of marines not see any guns when they where fired on. Otherwise this is a 7.",7,0,2,13 May 2001
Kelly's Heroes," Dated, but ok another one of those 24 hours of Eastwood movies on TBS
","Many of the actors in this film are dead, and the anti establishment theme is a bit dated.  Another one of those 24 hours of Eastwood on TBS, between them and CBC (in Canada) showing this film all the I can say this film is over kill on tv.

Donnie Brasco," Close to the book
","I read the book and find this movie quite close.  They had to merge a few characters and speed up time,  but when a book is over 1000 pages and five year of his life they did a credable job.  Believable and forgetabouit with Mike Maddison performances.  He's the most believable character in the whole film, and the guy who said 'did you think about making your big this week cause I hate to be looking for you' did a great suporting role.  Rent it tonight",8,0,2,2 April 2000
Evil Dead," Run of the mill horror movie!
","Evil Dead is a run of the mill horror movie which the remake lives off the past name! Evil Dead has minor character development and the viewer cares little for the cast. The film has more gore then scare. One is more creeped out than scared. Not much film tension with very little scare build up. One sees everything before the scare happens, and the scare build up is done by the numbers. However, there is a few creepy or gross moments. The acting was okay, but I ended up hating all the characters. They have left the movie open ended so they will have the option of creating a sequel. Maybe it will be like Saw or Friday the 13th where they run with the money and make continual parts. I give Evil Dead a five out of ten. My wife says a five out of ten is generous. A slow spring for movies.",5,13,25,12 April 2013
The Imitation Game," It was okay!
","It was an okay movie! What worked:Wellacted and directed movie. The mystery of could this machine work? Alan Turing characters comic bluntness. Turing job interview scene was hilarious. How intelligence system works, and Turing's ability to manipulate his boss. The portrayal of spy games and spy masters was compelling. What did not work: Turing was bright and right about issues, but lacked social graces. The viewer could see why Truing's co-workers and boss hated Turing. The declassification of knowing the German cold and the harsh decisions left the viewer cold. The Imitation Game okay, but hard to watch. Six out of ten stars.",6,2,4,16 January 2017
Caddyshack," Funny
","I like this film, and it ages well.  I don't know anyone who did not like this film; 6.9 ranking that's got to be wrong.  This movie had the perfect cast, everyone was not at their hight of fame yet, and if this film was done a few years later they could never afford the budget.  Ted Knight is highly unrated in this film, because of the other stars, but watch him closely and see the comic tension he creates.  Give this movie a chance.",8,0,1,13 June 2001
Shrek 2," Good sequel
","Spoilers!This film was a good sequel.  I love the voice of Eddie Murphy as Donkey, but the best had to be Puss, the voice of Antonio Banderas. The hair ball scene was great and you would understand completely if you have a cat.  In all, the story was a continuation of the first.  We follow the lifes of Shrek and the cast from after the wedding.  We learn more about the curse that was put upon Princess Fiona.  My opinion is that they should of stayed as normal looking people after taking a potion.  I love the end where they showed Donkey and the Dragon having mutant dragon/donkey offspring.  Puss does a good job singing. Parts of the story were swipes at LA and the Hollywood community.  I wonder if the fairy godmother was supposed to resemble Martha Stewart?  Good for both adults and children 7/10",7,0,0,24 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Stupid very stupid!
","Spoiler  Be warned this movie is stupid, but entertaining.  The director trying a comeback after the disappointing 'Jackie Brown' does better, but seems unable to hit his zenith of 'Pulp Fiction'.  Slow parts of this film, and over the top violence hurt 'Kill Bill', but unlike 'Jackie Brown' the story with over the top comedy makes this a watchable movie.  I was disappointed with the ending, but I should have knowing with the term volume 1 that it would leave you hanging.  I give this a 7 out of 10.  See this one before volume 2 comes out.",7,1,4,11 October 2003
Saw II," I just saw the movie! Does the movie make the cut?
","I just saw the movie! Does the movie make the cut? I found Saw 2 a dull blade compared to the first. The first movie is built on suspense which the second maintains, but saw 2's repetition loses the tension of the predecessor. The lack of character development along with too many characters , and the unlikable characters ruin the re pore with the audience. The elevator ending was stupid. The moral judgment of a sadist on other is a hard and de-humanizing display. Jig-saw lecturing the cop on morals is like Stalin lecturing Hitler on governmental responsibility. I cannot buy this! I like the first movie when the killer is just sick with a twisted logic. The doctor is a likable man a good formula, hard for the makers to improve on. 6 out of 10",6,4,14,29 October 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Silly and Stupid
","This movie is both silly and stupid, but I like it.  I like silly and stupid, and this is a great movie to watch on a Saturday with a couple of friends.  It has demented humor, and I can be a twisted sort, so I got a few laughs.  It has it all humor, action, and a very ruf edge.  This is not a terms of endurment type film, for what its worth the acting and directing is very good.  It is a unbelievable film, with a stupied concept, like Repo Man, and just as entertaining.  If you want to be entertained, watch this one for the fun of it.  This film is not for the serious at heart.",7,1,2,15 January 2001
Jurassic World," Better than the original
","Jurassic World is better than the original. I found Jurassic World to be a remake of Jurassic Park. Personally I find remake to be either great or awful! What worked: Chris Pratt plays a non P C alpha male which is balanced with intellect and compassion. Bryce Dallas Howard female character balance with Pratt perfectly. The female-male have a sexual tension mixed with strong personalities which create a spicy relationship. The children characters were believable and did not run hurt Jurassic by running around screaming. There is a story about socialization, how male and female interact, how groups interact and animals with nature . One see how nature survives and a social balance is created. Jurassic worlds warnings about modified genetics with the modified Dino. The special effects where great and made for a breath taking rollercoster ride. What did not work. Michael Crichton movies are always the same what we invent turns on US. Crichton stories always have technology vs humans. Seen on Crichton movie seen them all. Eight out of ten.",8,7,21,24 July 2015
Mission: Impossible II," 6
","It's ok, but you must like Woo's directing style to like this one. I gave it a 6, no real surprises, by the number action film.  Rent this one, it's nothing special.   The casting could have been done better, but when a actor make like 12 million a movie it seems to hurt casting usually.  If I watched it a couple more times I would like it more.",6,0,1,29 May 2000
World Trade Center," surprise of the summer
","Surprise of the summer! W T C shows the worst which happened bestowed by the enemies of America, while Americans show the best of humanity with the attack. A long movie, which did not drag. The story unfolds on several fronts. The coming together of America, and the human side. I believe the film is a dedication for all the heroes of that tragic day. A few questions the film never answered. Why did the gun fire by itself? Why was there a flame ball underground? Cage's character was right that the elevator shaft is the strongest part of the building to hide under. 8 out of 10. I wonder if there will be any spin off movies about the wars we presently face. Was there a ex-marine character that actually presently himself to help find survivors? If so, Kudos to him.",8,3,11,11 August 2006
Black Hawk Down," Realistic
","This movie is a factually based, and done in a way of a real life documentary.  My friend Tony told me about the book, and its pretty close to the movie.    There is a mention(very lightly) about not having heavy armor, from what Tony told me because it would look bad on CNN, and if I remember right this event cost Bill Clinton about 17 points in the polls, he would have lost the election if it was called right away.  I don't think CNN will affect foreign policy again, when they called for the US to help out a country, and Bush being ex CIA chief just wanted to convoy some food and get the hell out.  This movie shows why.  It's not a action movie I would call it more of a war/horror movie.  We see what army life is about, how well trained the special forces are, and the confusion, and horror of war.  The film is one constant feel of fear.  It was accurate, but according to Tony left  some of the grimmer parts out.  Where the troops got lost because the city has no street names, a lot of women and children died because the war lords used them as shields, and spotters.  You really feel bad for the men, and it must have been an eternity for help to arrive.",8,17,30,20 January 2002
The Dark Knight," On the long side, but still good!
","'The dark knight' length is on the long side, but still a good movie. I see a lot of post 9-11 in 'The dark Knight'. The Joker is like a terrorist who destroys without motive. Harvey Dent is the out of control administration which has to appear strong and good to keep society's hopes and aspirations balanced. 'The dark night' is the CIA, secret and clandestine, who's role is one of protector. The cell phone tap is similar to the Patriot act argument. When is too far too far? Batman never kills, unlike the Joker, in order to hunt a monster one does not become one. Self-sacrificing Batman chooses the good of the people over his girlfriend. The Joker loves to test people resolve. Batman is a unsung hero who's successes have to be unknown. Like Iran/Contra Batman takes the rap unfairly. Secrets are burnt for the good of everyone. 'The Dark knight' rides again lurking into the shadow combating the chaos evil brings. 7 out of 10 covert operations for 'The dark Knight'.",7,4,11,29 July 2008
Puss in Boots," Not bad for a cartoon.
","Not bad for a cartoon! Puss in Boots is entertaining for both children and adults. The movie has several adult related jokes, and themes. One sees many homages to Westerns in Puss in Boots. The movie has the usual messages about friendship, and the hero turn villain who redeems himself into a hero again. The movie has it all: hero, villains, betrayal, love interest, and humor. My wife took me out to see Puss in Boots, and we both liked it. Funny how animation has changed. One never sees the old painted animation anymore that I remember, back in the day yes I am dating myself of the old cartoons. I give Puss in Boots a seven out of ten. Not a good fall for movies, but this one is a nice surprise. Funny how there was no scary movies this Halloween!",Null,0,1,3 November 2011
Elysium," Watch the old Total Recall it is a better movie.
","Elysium is just another future style Total Recall movie. Watch the old Total Recall it is a better movie. The special effects are old news. One could see a message of today's political debates about immigration, health care, etc. What was effectively scary about Elysium is what happens to the earth with over population. With over population comes, poverty, unemployment, disease, and a employer who could can be nasty because of surplus in the labor market. The environment will suffer from over consumption, human waste, and people depleting the Eco-system. The movie started out believable, but I did not like the ending. What happens when the space station Elysium becomes over populated? None of the movies problems were solved. A depressing ending.",6,0,2,15 August 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," Too Long!!!!
","Too long, and not much of a story.  There is scenes in this film, that one ask what does this have to do with the story.  Good acting will go only so far, and with out a story the film dies.  Do not even rent this one. 2/10",2,13,37,31 July 2002
Taken," The best movie of the year so far.
","The best movie of the year so far, but the year is young. Nellson is a great actor. Nellson's stage presence of an angry father drives the movie. Nellson's character is an ex special forces operative whose daughter is kidnapped. Nellson's daughter is taken by a prostitution ring. When dad arrives to France the story's event become messy. Nellson gets nasty in this movie. Too many scumbags, Nellson has a few good one liners. A great action movie 8 out of 10. Worth seeing! Why did Nellson not use the help of his buddies is a good question for the film? His ex wife turns out to be an awful woman. She just treats him like garbage.",8,1,4,1 February 2009
This Is Spinal Tap," Ok
","This film has many funny spots, and is great to watch with a group of guys over beers.  The film came out at the peak of the 80's metal explosion, and is dated. I grew up in the 80's, and find this film on the mark for satire about big hair, leather pants, and overly macho attitudes.(which reminds me about hanging out at the 7/11 on a Friday night)  Anyways, this film is slow in spots, and should be watched with a group of people; some of the humor will be missed, and I caught it the second time around.  The airport scene, the interview at the end, and the amp that goes to 11 make this film interesting.",7,1,6,7 December 1999
Drag Me to Hell," not bad
","OK horror movie but redundant. I did not mind the story, but I like the movie Thinner way better. The story goes with a Curse, and a women tries to get it undone. The story is scary in parts, but other parts are just stupid. Way more scarier watching he promo than from actually watching the movie. Strong ending with a twist. The grave scene was over the top. I give the movie a six or seven out of ten. Drag me to hell is a rental or a cheap night movie. Maybe, a date movie too. If you want to watch a better movie which is similar to this one rent Thinner. You will find Thinner a thousand times better. This year has very few horror movie and not many good ones. Usually fall is better for horror movies.",6,0,2,30 May 2009
Grindhouse," The movie grinds down
","I like Grind House, but the second film grinds the pace down. Too much dialogue, and build up for the films conclusion. What work's with the 2 films are the weird tales which keeps the viewers attention. Kurt Russel really had fun with the role of stuntman Mike, which reverberates on film. The smoke meat secret in the first film is great. Tom S does great special effects in the first film. Robert always injects dance artistically well into a movie. One day Robert and Chirstphore Walken should do a film. The fake trailers were hilarious. Hobbo and a shot gun is my favorite. Cage's spot in the SS wolf movie is a laugh too. Well acted for a film which is too fun to be taken seriously. Here is a question is Stunt man Mike a throwback for Snake in Escape from New York? 7 out of 10. Worth rent. However I would fast-forward a few spot in the second film",7,2,4,20 June 2007
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," My wife likes the movie!
","Same story, but my wife likes the movie! Breaking Dawn has the same storyline and themes. Movie watchers experience the same sub stories of: the Cullens vs the evil vampires, alliances, the half human daughter, and what it is like to be a vampire! The themes of good vs evil, and the rules on how to be a good vampire continues. I found the movie redundant, but the final twenty five minutes has a plot twist. The plot twist saves the movie. B D part 2 has some good C G I and a few surprises I did not see coming. My wife said this and that was not in the book! Maybe part of the book did not translate well to film and the crew at B D 2 had to revamp the story. first part of B D 2 I give a 3 or 4 and the second half a 7. My wife would give B D 2 a 10. In the end, I guess B D 2 should be a 7 out of 10. On a side not I find all the Vampires look like they should be in a 1980's new wave music video.",7,3,10,1 December 2012
There's Something About Mary," Just Ok
","Spoiler!!! Toilet junior high humor.  I like this sort of humor, but such humor is either hit or miss.  The grandma on speed was funny, along with the cops part.  Other stuff was gross, or like the dog scene stupid.  I heard so much hype and found the movie not able to live up all the praise.  I hated the band, I was wondering if the bad singer getting shot was ment to be funny or relief? I will let you the reader decide.  Rent it, if there is nothing else left in the video store.  Better than being stuck with Ishtar; I still never had the nerve to rent that one.  Comedy is hard to do, and I found this style of movie gets graded the hardest.  6 out of 10 PS The Pizza guy was a twist, and was funny near the end; they should have used him sooner.  The end, was weired as they come.",6,1,2,13 May 2004
Mission: Impossible," Well I seen worse
","Not a bad movie, but his film was lacking something.  I find when Brian DePalma directs he creates, sometimes, very cold and sterile movies like this one, and Snake eyes.  Better then the second one in story, but colder in character then the first.  I hope they do not make a mission impossible three.",5,0,6,14 June 2001
Saw," WOW I just SAW this movie!
","Spoiler....'Saw' the movie is a perfect 10; well directed, acted, scripted, and all done on a low budget! The direction and story go hand and hand; the movie starts out as a mystery with the actors tell their stories. The characters stories intertwine, and meld together. Each individual story adds too the tension. There is a demented reality in this film which adds real scares. What evil lurks in the heart of an evil and insane man is revealed. This insane tension shows the directors skill, and the no name actors' ability. One could have a lower budget movie, without the over rated, and over paid actors in it. Where a 15 millions dollar payday only hurts the film's budget, and the movie over all. The only notable actor is Danny Glover aka Lethal Weapon. The conclusion tells all of motives, reasons, and why the film is called saw. I never saw the ending when it hit me. 10/10",10,0,3,2 November 2004
Super 8," A good movie!
","A good movie! Spielberg makes some good movies and Super 8 is one of them. The story is good, it has mystery, drama, comedy and action. One see in this movie the lives of the children and how the children deal with a supernatural mystery. The movie has the usual Spielberg special effect. Super 8 is well directed where the movie flows smoothly, has a rapid pace, and is not disjointed. I found the movie entertaining. I also like how the movie pays homage to older space movies. The movie is worth seeing. Super 8 is a 8 out of 10. Watch the credit at the end of the movie which shows the teenagers zombie movie. If you leave quickly you might miss it.",8,1,3,20 June 2011
The Last Samurai," Started out strong, but became sappy.
","The Last Samurai, started out strong, but like the Samurai in the movie it faded away with time.  The ending was too sweet, too sappy and too much.  I never understood why the man who modernized Japan, became the villain. The Industrialist fulfilled his obligation to the Emperor. In conclusion, Cruise fits well with the movie, but I hate the character Cruise evolves into.  I give it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,4,20 December 2003
Sinister," Sinister is a story right out of a Supernatural episode.
","Sinister is a story right out of a Supernatural episode! Except Sam and Dean would have the evil force salted and burned! Sinister has the Supernatural storyline of experts on evil, patterns, and ghosts. The movie mixes creepy dark 8 mm film footage in with the movie, which was influenced from the movie 8 mm. The dark walking into crime scene reminds the viewer of the movie Manhunter! Sinister is an excellent mix of the three mention movies/T V show which ends in a memorable ending. The movie has a feel of an evil presents which is in relentless pursuit of victims. Sinister is a different type of movie for Ethan Hawke. I give Sinister an eight out of ten.",8,1,3,13 October 2012
A Clockwork Orange," One of my better movies from my English Lit course
","Taking Dr Morton class in English lit/philosopy I found this the best book in the lot, and movie.  The movie transends the book well.  The story in the movie is better with the missing chapter, but the book is more complete with the extra chapter. The extra chapter makes my essay on what is evil easier. Read the book for the extra Chapter.  Now, on with the movie.  It is interesting, and the director get the feel right.  I like how they ended it, and it shows that violence be gets more violence.  Not for everyone 6 out of 10.",6,0,2,1 November 2003
Rio," My wife liked the movie but had some problems with it!
","Rio is a good movie. I enjoyed the story, but my wife had a few problems with the movie. The writers and producers really should have talked to some parrot lovers before shooting the movie. My wife had issues with the way they represented parrots: 1. Parrots have 4 toes not 3 2. Never ever feed your parrot from your mouth; a parrot can die from the bacteria in a human's mouth 3. Serving hot cocoa to a bird; stupid!! Chocolate is poisonous to birds; it will kill them. 4. Cockatoos are not villains; they are comedians or love muffins, the toucan should have been the villain, toucans eat little birds in the wild not fruit loops! One can tell my wife wrote the middle of the review. She hopes that some naive owners will not try some of these issues with their parrots. It sent a bad message. The only good thing my wife liked was that they showed poachers in a bad light! In conclusion, a nice ending which was fun and entertaining. I give the movie 7 squawks out of 10.",7,4,6,26 April 2011
Where Eagles Dare," Rambo before its time
","This film has more action in it than a Stalone flick.  For a 60's film wow. It has all the World War 2 stuff in it.  Nazi's, the warning buzzards, and a castle.  Kind of like Wolfenstien the video game.  Enertaining film, but not a classic.  A bit dated, but stunts, film quality etc gets better with time. Good late night movie!",6,3,9,16 April 2002
From Hell," Definitely from hell
","This film started out well, but continued to get unbelievable.  Johnny Depp plays a good role considering the script.  There is a hidden political message one will notice in this film.  Some parts of this film do not make any sense, but I will not say for it will ruin the film. 6/10",6,2,4,15 May 2002
Groundhog Day," Funny all the way through
","Not many comedies keep their momentum all the way through, but this one does.  I laughed at this movie until the end, and I gave it a 10.  No mater how many times I watch it or know the jokes ahead of time I still laugh. This film is like a old joke that never goes stale.  Well written, by SCTV's Harold Ramius, this film brings a fresh approach to comedy.  Bill Murrey is the best sort of jerk type guy for the role of a individual who has to live the same day over until he gets it right.  Buy this one!",10,0,3,30 March 2001
National Treasure," Disney meets 'Raiders of the lost Ark'
","Spoiler! National Treasure is an adult movie which kids can watch. Not overly violent or scary, but grown up enough that, Mr adult me, never though this was Disney. Casted perfectly, with the old UK USA rivalry for the treasure that each groups seeks. Sean Bean plays the perfect bad guy, and Cage play the humble, and non imposing role excellently. A bit of gen y and xers making fun of each other. The director keep a fast pace for a action movie. The script wonderfully mixes legend, history, and the Masons all together nicely. Watch for part 2, and I hope they do make a sequel. The best part of the film is when Cage plans to steal a item in this film. 8 out of 10. Worth seeing in the theater",8,0,1,28 November 2004
The Great Raid," Rangers all the way!
","If you like watching the history channel like I do you 'The Great Raid' is the summer movie for you. Not a flaw in The great raid. Directed and acted well. The script follows the historical and personal stories well. Movie is better than Pearl Harbor. The acting schools are better than years ago, and shows that no film needs a 9 million dollar actor which kills the budget, with cheap sets, and no script rewrite. Many years ago the need for name actors helped. Some of the no name actors do better films and acting, while the Julia Roberts, and Tom Cruises live on past glories and have been in disappointing films, with tired roles. Nice to not see all the computer animation in a film for a change, which is getting old. 9 or 10 out of 10. Nice to see a film which tells the story like it is. Not have all the Hollywood made up baloney. I rather watch the Duke if the film is fictitious. Good movie",9,4,8,18 August 2005
Limitless," 2011 version of Fight Club
","2011 version of Fight Club! When one sees Limitless and has watched Fight Club, they will notice similarities between the two movies. The beginning and the end of Limitless were inspired by Fight Club. How did I get here plot twist is used. The director's flow, style, mixed with the script's plot devices of blackouts, different personalities with the character, and the film's character's self-realization about himself creates a modern day version of Fight Club. Both movies show a protagonist who hates his current life and needs a change. Furthermore, both stories take off when the protagonist meets a sleazy antagonist character. Instead of the destruction of the main character, both Limitless and Fight club create a liberated protagonist. Is the protagonist liberated? One will not know unless there is a part two. If you like Fight Club you will love Limitless. Eight out of ten pills for limitless. I wonder if Cooper is another dynamic actor like Ed Norton?",8,0,2,30 March 2011
Rocky," Stalone's best
","As much as the media mocks Stallone, he won best picture for this film. He will never top this film, which made him a icon.  It's a story about a down on his luck loan collector/ boxers who gets a one time shot at the heavy weight championship, because of a late pull out by a contender, and the champ does not want to lose his money on the deal.  There is romance between Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life as Rocky, and together they make life livable. The rest of the cast is other down and outers who give the viewer a feeling of hopelessness until Rocky gets his chance.  This film is touching, and unforgettable.",9,93,129,9 April 2001
Don't Breathe," The surprise of the summer!
","Don't Breath is the summer movie surprise, so far, this year. Don't Breath started out weak. What did not work with Don't breath, at the begging was all the characters where scummy and unlikable. The other part of the beginning which I found hard to fathom is how the blind guy survive an attack by three people? Surprisingly, the movie improves when the blind man turns the light out in his house. The blind man has the advantage in the dark. In the dark, the viewer finds out how deranged the old blind man is. A instinctive primal fear of the dark sets in for rest of the film. As the robbers try to escape the house they find out what the blind man is hiding and will never let the robbers live. As the story unfolds, there is disturbing images and scenes. The ending is cold as the decaying as Detroit neighborhood surroundings. 7 stars. The makers leave room for part 2.",7,5,10,5 September 2016
Sicario," Blah!
","Blah but you can follow the story. Sicario has a story-line which keeps the viewer captive for how, and what will happen with the ending. Regrettably the characters are 2 dimensional and flat. Emily Blunt is the Jodi Foster type character from Silence of the Lambs who is disjointed and filled with doubt! Benicio Del Toro is the cold South of the border hit man right out of every mob movie. Josh Brolin the evil C I A guy aka Tommy Lee Jones style which was cold/calculating. Daniel Kaluuya flat character is the moral support of the Jodi Foster style character. The character development/character driven stories are so old/predictable which kills the story. Shocking ending became another predictable C I A government is evil story with the what did just do story-line. I wish there was a plot twist, or character twist. Saw the ending coming. 5 out of 10 stars.",5,2,4,2 January 2017
Pretty Woman," I just don't like this!
","I saw this film with my ex best friend and best man Dave.  I think he liked this film for Julia, and his eyes jumped right out of his head.  Julia did herself up for the male auidence; I wanted to go see Krate dude out for revenge 3 or some other mind numbing action film and old Dave or I guess back then new Dave wanted to see Julia.   I wish he ment her instead of well lets not go there; the acting is fine.  Richard and Roberts I never seen them act bad even with a bad story.  The story need something more to it like the Pizza movie Roberts was in before.  Acted well, just something missing in the story's execution.  The theme where people have hope, and can change is great, but the execution for the conclusion need's some juice. 5 out of 10.  Richard and Roberts should do more movie together there is a chemistry between them.  One can not help but see this in this film. Something tells me these actors are all right people.  I bet Julia, Richards and myself would argue on many issues, but their on screen warmth seem to be real.  I give credit for Julia's donation of money for 9/11 her tears where real.  Many other actor use event for their own purpose and never would give such a large amount of money.  Good for you Julie even if I don't agree with some of her views.PS  My wifes view is this film is opposite of mine she wrights a few of my review to give balance and found this story touching, warm and thinks Gear is a great actor.  My uncle calls him a b actor that fits a role.  Funny how opinions vary.",5,7,12,14 May 2004
Pretty Woman," My wife calls this film a nice romance; a dream
","My ex best friend and best man Dave went too see this film.  Dave's eyes popped out at Julia, I guess they dressed her up for the male audience; Myself wanted to see Karate Dude revenge or some other mind numbing movie. I found the acting done well, Gere and Roberts have never acted bad in a film I have seen.  They have a chemistry together and should do more films. Gere ages well like a wine.  Roberts sometimes, she is a real love her or hate  type of actress. She surprises me by doing some great movies.  I probably disagree with Gere and Roberts on many issues, but the warmth they show on screen I do believe is real.  Not many people would cry and donate the money Julia did for 9/11.  Good for you Julia,  a real person who isn't a caring phoney.  The story bothered me I found the execution  of it just lacking, for the conclusion where there is hope for the 2 main characters, and their power to change and  to become better people.  My wife who writes to give my reviews balance will state the following: The film was a fairy tale in that good things do happen to those that desire better in life.  The prince charming is out there for everyone.  7/10",5,2,6,14 May 2004
Pulp Fiction," Film of the 90's
","This director peaked when he made this film, I do not think he will ever be able to out do Pulp Fiction.  This films timing, cast, and story mixed perfectly, like a good meal.  It is a combination of talent and luck to make a film like this.      The timing is incredible, for it was released in the mid 90's during the hight of political correctness.  Harrison Ford could not pick up a gun in the movie clear and present danger.  Swearing, any bad stereo types of characters was tabu.  The film industry was getting very boring, and this shocker came out.  I was surprise there was no protests over this film.  The swearing, racial slears, violence, drug use, and rape pushed this film to new lows.  This film is well made not from cheap shock value. The shock value is a by-product of the sleazy characters.     It is the scripts characters and the story make this film mind blowing, and fresh.  The acting is incredibly strong, no one could a ford this cast now, because all the actors where either up and coming or over the hill during this film, and luckly instead of watching a actor get paid 20 million and the film suffers, we see a very strong cast.  The 4 stories all melt into one, and the films message is about choices in life, along with a anti violent message.  Unlike many movies of that time it does not preach this message, which insults the viewer, but brilliantly makes a subtle message.",9,0,1,19 February 2001
Jack Reacher," A detective story
","Reminds me of the 1970's and 80's detective shows! A difficult mystery needs to be solved, and a wrong righted. Jack Reacher every Friday at 9 LOL! Jack Reacher upgrades the detective genre with G T A style cars and car chases. The roar of the engine and cars are right out of a G T A game. The clothes, cars and style are similar to the Dean Winchester character from Supernatural. The walk, tone, and dialogue of Reacher is similar to Dean Winchester. What works for the movie Jack Reacher is the character Jack Reacher. Reacher is comparable to a Porsche. Reacher is a well oiled machine mentally, physically and spiritually. The character driven story revolves around how Reacher is always in control of situations, because Jack uses his wits before other means. A 3 D thinker who is one step ahead. The body and mind operate as one and his body with precision when needed. Interesting character who does not worry about the opinion of others and plays by his own rules. I give Reacher a seven out of ten.",7,2,7,10 January 2013
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Pulp Fiction meets True Romance
","This film is a splice between Pulp Fiction and True Romance.  What it lacks in budget, it makes up in wit.  A good story with a heavy English accent.  I love the ending; this film shows how many lives spin out of control by one event.  This is a must see for Guy Richie fans. 8/10  I wonder what he could have done with a bigger budget!",8,0,1,2 June 2002
Rocky III," Awesome
","Spoilers   Stallone writes a great script, with an excellent cast.  It is about hunger, determination, and eye of the tiger.  The film portrays Mr T as a hungry new fighter with intensity who challenges the champion, and Rocky has to over come the challenges of staying on top.  Hulk Hogan is in this film, and adds great comic relief to the boxer wrestler scenario. Great script, with Rock blaming himself for Mickeys death, and you feel his pain when Mickey dies, and Carl Weather's comes into the picture as Rocky's mentor for a favor.  This is movie if you watch it feeling low, it will motivate you.",8,0,0,1 May 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Geared for children and child like minds
",Spoiler!!!I do not like how Harry's family treated him.  It is surprising that a lot of families are like this. The parents spoil the one kid and mistreat the other. He was much better off at boarding school.  I like the seeker game that was kind of neat.  I like how they used owls to deliver the mail. Harry just looks like the ordinary kid next door.  The roles were cast well. I thought the creepy looking guy was the bad guy but I was wrong.  It shows you that one can not judge a book by its cover.  It will be interesting to see the next one in the series.  7/10,7,0,2,29 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Just ok. More of a video game than a movie
","Spoiler!!!The beginning of this movie was slow.  It looked like a Euro Dance Party off MTV.  I gave that part a 3 out of ten.  Then the action scenes I gave a 5 out of 10, it got a little long, but interesting effects. Then when the story downloaded, it became more of a interesting movie, and  turns into the old intelevision's dungeons and dragons video game;With opening and closing of doors.  Then the action became interesting, but it evolves into a video game like Double Dragon; I wished I had a Joy Stick or they showed points on the top of the screen. 8 out of 10.  Then they explained the Matrix, and I took it in Math recently and found the explanation of how it fixes itself logical. 10 out of 10.  Then the ending I found to be the biggest jip of all, like leaves me hanging, that is no ending at all.  It is like, when you program the VCR and it cuts off 10 minutes early and one never sees the movie ending.  (ending 1 out of 10)  Overall 6 out of 10.  PS Is there a video game out of this movie yet?",6,0,1,20 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," ok movie
","This movie is ok, it had a high budget, and interesting characters. Except for Ed Harris the movie's line up is full of no name actors, with no name performances.  I hate it when a movie is filmed ie like this one where it is suppose to be in Russia, and everyone has a British accent.  At least Ed Harris, gave and effort to sound German, and culturally act as one. This gives a movie believablity, and the director should of gave this consideration.  Then they have to add all this personal crap, and phony heroics to all ready interesting true story.  All these negative factors weighed down a film that could be a 8, but instead is a 6.",6,0,1,29 March 2001
A Beautiful Mind," I Can't Believe Crowe did not win best actor for this
",I can not believe Denzel Washington beat Crowe out for best actor on this. Russel Crowe acted circles around Washington.  I believed this is his best role.  It will be hard for him to beat this.  He was great in Gladitor but even better in A Beautiful Mind.  It was a sad movie where one overcomes one's disability through one's special gift.  They aged him through out the movie and did a fantastic job doing it.  I found the movie very inspiring. This one is a must see and a must own.  I wish I would of seen it in the theatre.  10/10,10,0,2,2 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the first!
","I was very surprised that this was better than the first.  Usually sequels are pretty bad, but this was entertaining.  It was different enough from the first one and fits well in the series.  This film leaves room for a part III.  I really like the owls as the postman.  The beginning is funny with his mean uncle and the cake.  This movie can be enjoyed by the whole family. Some parts might scare younger ones.  The film kept one guessing as to what would happen next.  Take the family to this one. 9/10",9,0,0,29 November 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Funny better that the trailer
","Watching the trailer makes one wonder will Mr and Mrs Smith be a good or bad film? I could not tell! Well, the movie has a relationship element which my wife enjoys, and a comedy element I enjoyed. Mr and Mrs Smith starts out strong and keeps a solid pace. The music is great and suits the movie. The action and comedy is well directed. Vince Vhaughn is a strong supporting role. Vhaughn can be annoying and funny at the same time, a hard task. Pitt and a few others could pull of the lead role. Pitt was able to act serious, and silly. Jolie is a mystery for the viewer to understand, and Jolie fits the character's actions. A good drive-in movie. Two movies for $7.50 is a great deal, and Mr and Mrs Smith is a great headliner. 7 out of 10. A great date movie. I feel my wife and I still date, just like the chemistry between the two lead actors portrayed in Mr and Mrs Smith.",7,2,8,12 June 2005
Die Hard," The Die Hard that started them all.
","I hate this one, but the story and action saves this film.  I believe it must be Willis character.  Reminds me of a jerk in high school that is popular, but everyone only pretends to like him;  Or someone at work who has to over prove all the time, and you wish he would just walk away!  At least Willi's character can back his actions, which is better than alot of 30 an 40 year olds who run around living in denial.  I guess this over macho 80's bi-product is the shame of my generation.  It has a lot of sappy Hollywood cliches.  The over syrupie cop who can not fire his gun, and why did they have the Run DMC limo driver in this film, what did he add to this film. The boring over done gender conflict the action hero has with his wife.  I do not know if this is because of Raider of the lost Ark, but the late 80's early  90's where full of blond bad guys, how over done.  Every late 80's action film has to copy 48 hours swearing to prove how macho one is. Despite this baggage the action saves this film.  The fire fight, the chopper explosion, and rocket attack make this film exciting.  I would watch this film, but probably route for the bad guys.  6/10",6,1,5,31 October 2002
Psycho," The temp plate for modern slasher movies!
","Psycho is the temp plate for moderns slasher movies! Tame by today's standards with smaller body counts and less graphic or creative murders. But, and I mean but , Scream, Jason, Michael Myers, and many slasher with knife movies follow the temp plate: (1) Psycho has a slow burn start, the audience knowing something bad will happen but when. The slow start where the characters not always, but usually doing something they should not dive into a scene where the audience get hit bam with a murder scene. (2) The mood setting music be it the sharp violin sounds of Psycho, the chi chi sounds of Friday the 13th creates a chill in the back of the audience. (3) The unpredictability of the unbalanced character in a creepy way. Norman Bates' odd conversation with the hotel guest create and uncomfortable uneasiness which resonates with the audience. (4) The ending answers questions of why, when it's too late and everyone is dead finds out Why! Bate's mother pushed Norman over the edge. However, the problem is never fixed the antagonist is still around for part 2. 7 out of 10",7,0,0,23 October 2017
American Made," Cruise is back!
","Cruise is back! After two bad movies, Tom usually makes a solid movie as a comeback. What I liked about American Made is true stories or based on true stories are more entertaining than made up fiction! The over unbelievable can not be made up. How much the CIA knew and or wanted to know is left to the viewer's interpretation in American Made. The film starts out with strong character development with a bored, risk taking pilot aka Tom Cruise fits the profile for a CIA operative and is recruited. Cruise nails down the alpha male con man perfectly. Memorable scenes in the middle with the drug cartels, dangerous missions and reverting back to normal family life. The Beary Seal/Tom Cruise character theme is once Seal got in the dirty business, one can not say no and becomes deeper and deeper involved. Not that the shady character did not enjoy the benefits of the job and adrenaline of being an operative. Much humor is added to the middle of American Made with small town Arkansas with the C I A and drug money changing the town overnight during a recession. American made has a strong ending with the reality of an operative being told there is a risk and you will be left on your own. Nine stars.",9,1,4,4 October 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not a bad movie but more the same!
","Not a bad movie, but more the same. I like Transformers two, but if you have seen the first movie you have basically seen the second one too. The script, acting and directing is good. I will not call Transpormers two a bad film. There is a but however here. The special effects were great in this film, but however are the same effects as in the first film. The special effects were mind blowing effect for the first film, but are the same old same old for the second film. Their is some comedy and a lot of eye candy in this film to provide balance for the special effects. I give the film a six out of ten. A decent summer film; it will be a soon to see on VOD.",6,0,4,4 July 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," one strong movie!
","One strong movie!Zero Dark Thirty is a well directed, and acted movie. One experiences and gains understanding of the intelligence community while watching the movie. Zero Dark Thirty begins with the intelligence gathering,(interrogation) and analyst part of the Central Intelligence Agency. One experiences the guilt, responsibility, politics and dangers of operations involving terrorism. The viewer sees the unfolding of intelligence operations morphing into a military operation. The Seal team six compound raid operation is detailed and accelerating final 20 minutes of the movie. I give Zero Dark Thirty a nine out of ten. Watch Zero Dark Thirty in the theater for the full experience.",9,1,9,15 January 2013
War of the Worlds," Best movie of the summer so far
","Best movie of the summer so far. I found the movie very captivating, exciting and interesting. Wells' is great writer, when one is listening to Freeman's narration of Wells' writing from the book. Wilfred, my friend, says the book War of the Worlds is short, and I find this hard to believe. The movie could have been longer and explained the event more. I do not direct movies, I will leave this question to Spielberg. Hard to believe such a concept could come from a mind in the 1800's. H G Wells' radio play caused panic with the idea, I believe back in the 30's. The movie is about survival during a war. Cruise plays someone who is lucky, and thinks at the same time. The part with the van is believable. The ending is the same as the 1953 movie my buddy Wilfred and I saw when we were both in grade 7. I find reading the book or seeing the earlier version will ruin the movie, so watch this one first. 8 out of 10 see this one before it leaves the theater.",8,3,11,1 July 2005
30 Days of Night," It was OK
","My wife and I went out to see 30 days of night. Monica, my wife, says the movie was OK. It would be awful to have 30 days of nights, and worse to have vampires around, which is the premise of the movie. How could the survivors live if the vampires could smell the human's blood? Well directed and acted. 30 days is similar to 'the thing, with the gross vampires, gross effects and the winter isolation which give a gloomy feel. The vampires wanted to leave no survivors so people would believe that vampires was just a myth. Hence, the vampires could continue on their feedings. I hate the end, but the end was original. My wife give a 5, but I give the movie a 6 out of 10. Definitely a rental",6,0,1,22 October 2007
Wedding Crashers," Okay
","A six or 7 out of ten. The actors did a good job. Vince and Owen were okay. The movie dragged in spots, I expected the movie to be stupid, but the movie dragged in a couple of spots. Will Ferrell appeared in the last third and saved the film. Will can be funny, but in a strong way like Ajax. To much much Will can kill a movie, but Will is great in a supporting role, and Will saves the Wedding crashers by himself. The last third of the movie was dying, and Will gave it fresh material. Typical low-end humor, in old school style, but not over done. Christopher Walken plays a very small role, and does not perform any humor. Walken can be very funny, like the Jayman in Envy. Not a bad film.",6,2,4,16 July 2005
Ice Age," Love that squirrel
",This was a great animation with lots of humor.  Denis Leary's voice is always recognizable.  This film is great for kids but also entertaining for adults.  The voices suited the characters.  This is one that I will purchase when it comes out.  I felt sorry for the doodoo birds.  A good family orientated film.  8/10,8,1,1,3 May 2002
Man on Fire," Not bad.
","I am not a big fan of D Washington but Man of Fire is a good movie. Washington plays the serious quiet role excellently. I doubt we will ever see Washington do a comedy! Man on Fire is about an ex government agent out for revenge. The Man on Fire is well motivated, and quietly good at his craft. One sees how the mind of an assassin works. The movie has the predictable surprise plot twist at the end. Watchable and entertaining. Man on Fire is well directed and acted. I found the movie left a message about how evil people can be. Man on Fire reminds me of the 1970's Charles Bronson movie era. I give Man on Fire a seven out of ten.",7,0,0,24 April 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Cruise has three good performances in a row.
","Edge of Tomorrow is the surprise hit of the summer so far. Edge of Tomorrow is a mix of Star ship trooper and Groundhog day. Tom Cruise relives the same battle over and over, which is a mystery? The story is intertwined at several levels with each new characters and scenes leading into a new plot twist. A well acted, directed movie, which Tom Cruise stands out! I have noticed that Tom Cruise has his charisma back. The first fifteen minutes is a strong performance which mixes charm and wit. Cruise's acting drives the movie with his demeanor and mannerism which create a screen chemistry that only movie star dynamic can add to a movie. A strong seven out of ten.",7,1,3,9 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," over hyped movie!
","Martin Scorsese is losing his gift as a director. The Wolf of Wall Street is another rendition of Scorsese's other movies. The narration, actions, and flow of Wolf of Wall Street is similar to Goodfellas, Casino and Mean Streets. Di Capiro's lead character is just another version of the Henry Hill character from the movie Goodfellas. Through the streetwise narration of Di Capiro one learns how the system is scammed, and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs, and prostitutes. The characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew of low lives. Scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with nudity, massive drug use, over the top sex, which can not compensate for the lack of story depth. 3 hours was way too long for a half hour story. Five stars out of ten.",5,78,140,1 January 2014
Army of Darkness," Stupid, fun
","I really like this film, it makes me laugh.  It is weird, and funny at the same time.  It has a book that bites, and other stupid gags.  I watched the collector edition, with the 2 different endings.  I like the original ending myself.  This is not for the serious crowd!",8,1,2,4 February 2002
The Last King of Scotland," worth renting on a summer evening!
","Worth renting on a summer evening! My first two days of holidays I always rent movies and order in pizza, while I sit on the couch. I first watched Alpha Dog and The last King of Scotland is a far superior movie. The acting is great! Forrest has done is best performance; I believe Forrest will never be able to out perform himself. The directing is at a good pace. The story keeps the viewer enthralled. 7 out of 10. I wonder how close the story is to the real life experience. This movie is not for the faint hearted. Who every plays the nasty security agents hits the mark. Forrest is a under rated actor. The protagonist in this film sure is stupid.",7,0,2,9 July 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Better than the other two.
","One of my few day shifts at the post office, so I was able to go!  The theater was right across from the plant and I met my buddy, Danny, who got free promo tickets for opening night or my buddy Dave won them but could not show.  I can not remember, but I think it is the latter.  It was exciting going to a premier showing; they had draws, local celebrities, save the Jets campaign, etc.  The movie was ok.  Another typical action movie, but I like the water Jug part.  I hope many of you can guess the mystery, my mathematically inclined friend did, and myself a little after the movie. Bruce Willis does not do the over the top annoying borderline jerk character, and I like the more realistic role. Typical ending 6/10",6,1,3,30 October 2002
It Chapter Two," Lacking!
","It Chapter Two is lacking. Many cliche here for an audience here: Gay couple which gets beat up by town toughs. (there is always the town tough angle) The black family burned out years ago ( there is always a bad town secret) The old tribal ritual which will get rid of the creature. ( there is always some ancient ritual. How and why it works is never explained) Well It Chapter Two becomes a formulated movie, which turns into story about childhood PTSD, and bad dreams. Every past memory must have the chasing dream sequence. Yet another cliche, which turns into another C G I fest. We never find out what, why of the clown, and or the history behind it. The remake is different from the book and other movies. The end is like a therapy session of shrinking down bad feelings and memories. Nothing about the clown, and more about the characters growing up and past. The first movie was what the second was not. Maybe the joke about not knowing how to finish a story is a joke about the movie. Maybe the break between part one and two made the story lacking. Well 3 stars there is something just lacking.",3,5,12,8 September 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Anchor garbage
","Stupid comedy done well is funny.   Stupid comedy poorly executed is stupid. This film tastes as flat as a 3 week open bottle of coke in the fridge. Most people in the theater laughed, because they expected a funny film, but the the laughter was contrived not the pee your pants laughter of a funny film. Will took the money and ran.  A couple more films like this  and Will will become another Chevy Chase, or maybe Will will be just a good support actor with performance like 'Old School'  The supporting cast comedy adds nothing, and the only gem of this film is the cameos of Vince Vhaughn, Luke Wilson,  Tim Robbins, and Ben Stiller.  Unlike the supporting cast these seasoned actors know facial expressions, mannerism etc.  Charisma goes a far way, but this script should of been turned down by Will or Will will become another Burt Reynolds, Cheve Chase, and John Tavolta who excellently act but kill their careers performing in b rate movies.  Will should get a better agent, or read his own scripts,  don't kill your careers for Will can make people laugh and that is special.  Stay away 3 out of 10",3,2,4,11 July 2004
American Gangster," Not as good as we own the night
","The comeback of 70's style movies is in full swing. Maybe 3-D movies will be next. I like the sound track, feel, and pace of the movie. Washington is a OK actor, and the rest of the cast is good. Crowe plays a strong role, but the script seem to typecast Crowe into a flat character. The script is strong, and the shoot out is memorable. Borlin shines playing a dirty cop. A true standout performance. The stages, camera angles, and diolouge is right out a 70's cop show. I liked the movie. I found We Own the Night had a slicker feel and more tension. I would rent Americian Gangster, but buy We Own the Night. 6 out of 10. Good for a Saturday movie night.",6,4,12,3 November 2007
The Green Mile," Stephen King
","Will be studied in English class just Jack London, or Robert Frost one day when after he dies years from now.  This film is original and keeps one guessing.

The Reader," Artsy
","The Reader is an artsy film. This movie is not for kids. The Reader is a very sexually charged movie. A young boy loses his youth to an older manipulative woman. The affair causes the protagonist pain with his future relationships. The woman is a Nazi with a sordid past, which comes full circle with the story. The viewer learns that the woman cannot read, and her shame or pride makes the character go through many painful and distasteful acts to hide her illiteracy. A sad train wreck conclusion is inevitable. A sad story about a sad part of history. I give this movie a 5 out of 10. Interesting story, well acted , and directed. However, the story left me bothered.",5,2,7,11 February 2009
Jaws," 'That was no boating accident

Great movie, great lines, suspense, and Robert Shaw as the old captain with his story about the Idianaplous made this a landmark for other films to follow.

Dark Shadows," Silly
","A good movie with a mix of comedy and silliness! The story is silly, which is about a cursed vampire who returns to his home town. The vampire (Depp) is reunited with the witch (Green) who cursed him. The witch has the hots for the vampire, and creates much drama as the spurred lovers. The comic part of the story is the drama/tension between Green and Depp. What makes the silly comedy work is the acting brilliance of Johny Depp. Depp's line delivery, and straight face seriousness creates perfect comic delivery. Many other actors would come across stale by over acting the scene. The movie started out silly and ended stupid which equals great comedy. I give Dark Shadows a seven out of ten.",7,2,7,15 May 2012
Hancock," A poor version of Ironman
","With Ironman and the Hulk we now have Hancock. I did not mind Handcock, but the movie is just OK. Humor plays a huge role for the movie. The humor saves the movie from being forgettable, and the scripts kills the movie with a sad storyline in the 2an half. The Hulk and Ironman had the huge climax, while Handcock was more anti-climatic. Not the worse movie, but I would not buy the film either. My friend knew the guy who wrote the comic or story. I went to see how the film played out. 6 dollars out of 10 for movie entertainment. Why is there so many superhero movie out there? I wonder if there is going be one too many superhero movie out there. Batman this week? I wonder what will be in the next 2 weeks.",6,1,4,16 July 2008

Are the bad guys from the government or a private security firm or both? Why is the FBI guy in the story? How will Mark get out of this predicament? The story unwinds at a entertaining pace. The ending like all action movies is over the top. I found the film gritty and mean. Shooter has a political message about special interest in government. 7 out of 10. I was over heated and came home early from work and found Shooter enthralling enough keep my attention off from being sick. A good DVD rental.",Null,1,4,10 July 2007
Inception," One good movie
",I really enjoyed Inception. I found the acting and directing excellent. The scripted was blended well with many plots and sub plot devices crafted into one story. The movie never deviates from the story's message. The movie's message is about what is reality and what is perception? The concept of an idea being like a virus for the human mind is great. One can plant the idea or virus by visiting the victims dreams and placing the idea in the persons subconscious is believable. I would give Inception four out of five stars. One of the better movies this year. Make Inception a movie night outing! I enjoyed it. The preview give this film no justices.,8,2,9,5 August 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Well just okay
","With Hollywood running out of idea we have another remake. Murder on the Orient Express is another soon to be forgotten remake. The producers try to make the new version with more of an edge and more P C, but yet try to maintain true to the original story. What worked: The acting was top notch, and the director keeps and even pace. There was no drag time. Kenneth Branagh crushed it as Hercule Poirot and the supporting characters complemented the main character, Hercule, with there limited character arches. What did not work: As much as the makers tried to do a modern upgrade of Murder on the Orient Express the story is still old. The murder mystery genera from the 70's and 80's aka Columba, Mattlock, Murder She Wrote etc follow the Agatha Christie model, which is tired, and old. Changing up a few characters, adds little spice to an old story. Having Johnny Depp in such a minor role is miss use of such a dramatic actor. A surprise ending, and watchable movie. But and there is a but just balances out and make just an okay movie. 6 out of 10 stars",6,3,9,14 November 2017
Sherlock Holmes," Not a bad movie!
","My wife wanted to see Sherlock Holmes and we just missed seeing the movie in the theater. My wife wants to see part two that is in the theater now. Therefore, I bought her part one for Christmas before we see Game of Shadows. If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes you will like the movie. Sherlock Holmes follows the series formula. The script has a supernatural mystery which Holmes is eventually able to solve using his intellect. Holmes logically deducts clues into conclusions. The characters are presented well by the actors and the script and acting melds perfectly. Guy Richie, the directer, interjects comedy and suspense into the movie perfectly creating a good pace for the film. I am happy that we watched part one first for the ending leaves a storyline for part two. I give Sherlock Holmes seven out of ten. Regrettably the movie's trailer gives the film no justice!",7,1,1,29 December 2011
The Secret Life of Pets," Some what good, some what bad!
","Somewhat good, somewhat bad! The Secret Life of Pets is an animated film about what pets do when the owners are gone. What's good: The characters The cats, dogs, and the budgie all have personalities. THe Cat is smug, the dogs are silly, but loyal etc. The pet stereo-types the cat chasing the light pointer, Dogs sniffing bums, chasing their tales. The Budgie who is clever but loves to kiss the glass. The ending is great about how pets provide unconditional love. Each pet suits certain personalities. The muscles bound guy with the little budgie. What's bad: The redundant home away from home find home again story, where everyone works together. Sweet Pea the budgie had no voice! The viewer had no idea of what the budgie was thinking. More laughs than slow time. My wife would give it a 8 out of 10, I would give it a 6 out of 10 so it gets a 7 out of 10.",7,3,7,9 July 2016
The Terminal," Not great but good
","I did not mind this movie.  It could have been very dry, considering how long one could make a movie about one place an airport.  It had villains namely the immigration officer.  Good guys Tom Hanks.  A love interest the flight attendant.  Even some mystery, the other people who work there.  The movie is sappy, but that is it's intention.  Directed at a quick pace.  The movie has a set goal, Tom Hanks visit to New York.  I believe the real life guy was stranded in the Paris airport, when trying to arrive to Holland.  My guess is that this is what influenced this movie.  I give this movie a 7 out of 10.  I believe people can adapt to many different environments.  Tom Hanks did his usual good acting and made the audience feel for this individual.  I could not even imagine being put in this situation.  I, personally, think that many people would go crazy.",7,3,6,27 June 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," A film of Eloquence
","I figured prison life to be much harsher, as seen in other films.  This is the films only weak point, but then the story would suffer if the film was like Fight club.  This is a story about a man who loses everything but still survives.  He uses his intelligence to outwit his attackers, and function in prison.  No matter what happens he still kept his dreams alive.  What is a man without dreams?  The word institutionalized is used in this film to describe what the prison does to the individual. Tim Robbins will not have the inner freedom of who he is change to what the prison dictates.  There are many interesting subplots that keeps the viewer's attention.  These subplots culminate into a unforgettable conclusion.",8,2,5,10 September 2001
The Cannonball Run," WOW What a disappointment!
","I was excited about seeing this movie.  When I was in grade 6 I wanted to see the king of burnt rubber Burt Reynolds.  This movie is based off the Cannonball, and the Gumball Rally.  A big budget, and big name actors alone can not make a movie.  Great idea but no script.  The first movie I saw on the VCR was this one, I waited 2 years to see it, and my sister's boyfriend Blake was right this film is flat. 4/10",4,4,8,14 May 2003
The Big Short," A good movie for a complicated story.
","The Big Short is a well acted movie where the character driven sub stories meld perfectly into the main story of the mortgage fraud of the U S housing market. Pitt's, Bale's, and Goseling's performances were believable money people. Pitt is an introvert whose quirks make the money man see the truth. Bale is an exesentialistic thinker who is ahead of the curve for market trends, Goseling is a slick Wall Street salesman. Surprisingly, Carrell stole the show as the hyper, (every one of the these movie characters would be regrettably labelled with a disability instead of a gift by today's mainstream society) brutally honest moral conscience of The Big Short. What The Big Short does well is merge the sub stories into explaining the complexities of the mortgage crisis. The biggest fraud in the history of the U S. Investors were fraudulently buying crap, bundled mortgages, which creates false demand and price increases in the housing market. As with all realists , ridicule and attacks follow until proved right. What hits most is when Carrell's character wallows in disbelief over the corruption as the housing market crashes, He refuses to sell his shares wanting to be proved wrong. He was hoping he was wrong. Seven out of ten stars. Time well spent.",7,1,1,13 February 2016
The Conjuring," Eight out of ten
","Eight out of ten, and here are the reasons why. The strong story is about how a demonic attack happens. How the Warren's detect and deal with demonic forces. The actors/characters create a mixture of fear and rational behavior which makes the conjuring believable. Director James Wan creates a slow build up of horror where the viewer feels a bad event is going to happen, but does not know what kind of event. The director created enough character development which builds up empathy for the family where one experiences the haunting as a family member. My wife found The Conjuring creepy. Myself, I found the Conjuring to be a good ghost story.",8,2,7,20 July 2013
Never Back Down," not bad
","My wife and my friends did not want to see this movie last Saturday, and I wanted too. So sad! We saw a awful movie instead. On Sunday my wife and I went to the movie, and it was great. The movie had a great theme were one fights in order to have peace. The antagonist fought for the wrong reasons glory, and attention. The mix of mixed martial art, a love interest, and the kid who got over his anger is a great story. Never Back down also show why the characters act the way they do. I hope the antagonist learned some humility from his defeat. 6 out of 10. Decent Karate movie. I love those movie and the crowd which attends them even more. 6 out of 10. PS I will never grow up.",6,3,10,17 March 2008
Halloween," The original
","This film started it all.  It is a horror classic, that has a low body count, and slow build up.  This movie is a slow burn!  It is scary, and Donald Pleasent creates the atmosphere for the evil Michael Myers.  This film is so over played on tv, but still worth watching. 8/10",8,0,4,7 June 2002
Back to the Future Part II," Have to watch the films together!
","Have to watch the films together! I watched some of the second film seperatly from the first. Ouch, not good! The 3 film is a series similar to the Sopranos. Recently watching the first film, and then catching the second film on TBS the viewer notices many jokes, hidden meanings which were missed when not viewing the movies recently together. The center theme of the script is the time line conitinuum. If broken, the result could be disastrous. 3 parts of the film I notice is that Michael J Fox wears the same clothes, uses the same expressions etc because it is the 1985 Marty. Genetics and history repeats itself is another inside joke in all three films. A polarity with time travel theme. As history repeats itself the same people do the same things, but a little differently. Biff, is the usually unhappy jerk, who is selfish, and believes everyone owes him. If Biff is not happy, then no one is. This movie is a great set up for what will happen in the third. One can watch ones self, but not interfere, and at the same time learn via the third person. In, second viewing I give this film a 7 out of 10. I wish we all could watch ourselves in the third person.",7,7,14,29 November 2004
Blow," a scaled down version of Good Fellows
","SPOILERS. Not a bad film, worth seeing at the movie house.  The film is done like Casino, and Good Fellows,  music, pace etc.  Its about a guy who is worried about money his whole life, and his mom would leave his dad for periods, because it was a big problem.  He never listen to his dad's advice about money that its not as important as people.  With the idea in his head about making alot of cash, and not having to work for it he became engrossed with greed.  Money, does not solve all his problems, and the film shows the life of a non violent drug dealer. How much was left out of this film I do not know, but it shows his  problems of back stabbing, phonies, bad relationships, ruined families, dishonesty, and incarceration, and it catches up.(to the point where his wife complains about money just as his mother did)  This guy gets betrayed several times in the movie and for the damage he does to society he get a 100 years.  Very solid!",7,0,1,30 April 2001
1408," The first 10 of the year and summer.
","1408 is the best film I have seen all year, and probably the best film of the summer. Jaskson plays a excellent hotel manager who tries to convince Mike, the author, not to stay in room 1408. The room evolves into a personal hell, and a haunting all in one. The way Mike figures to survive is brilliant. I do not want to write more and ruin the film. The directing is excellent. The movies tension is unbearable. I never get scared at movie and felt the fear. The camera angles and special effect were woven perfectly into a flawless story. Stphen King is a brilliant writer.Do not rent 1408, run do not walk to go see the movie. I would rather watch in the movie house then on DVD. 10 out of 10 A great drive in movie.",10,1,4,23 June 2007
Raging Bull," Better than average
","Boy, did this guy have a great relationship with women, he could single handily start the feminist movement.  At least this movie is honest. The guy's demons where rage, and jealously.  This movie is better than average, but drags in parts, and a few scenes were of little use to the story.  The acting was not the bad, but Goodfellas is the evolved version of this film. 7/10",7,0,2,22 July 2002
Taken 2," Not a bad movie but not as good as the original!
","Taken 2 not a bad movie,but not as good as the original. There are some weak points and strong points in the movie! The weak points are hilarious. The young daughter in the movie can throw random grenades in a crowded city without anyone getting hurt! The young daughter who is learning to drive can out-drive the police. There is always an object lose pipe etc to help out the protagonist. The positive parts of the movie are all the characters: good guys bad guys play believable roles. Taken two is well directed, which makes the movie fast paced. The action and fight scenes are comparably good to the Bourne Identity. Bourne is the standard all other action movie are compared too. All in all, Taken two has more positives than negatives. I give Taken 2 a six out of ten.",6,1,5,6 October 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Lame dumb stupid
","Spoiler       I can watch a movie and let the unbelievable bend, but this movie went way to far.  At least Hannable is mean in this film unlike the new movie entitled Hannable.  When Hannable can surgically chew some guards face off and put it on his perfectly and no one notices, thats just to lame for me.  How can this guy figure out what other criminals can do and whole room of FBI profilers can't.  Would you trust him even.  Jodi Foster and the guy have these weird deep conversations all the time.  Boring I can her the same weirdness on the bus on my way to work.  Like all copies of a copy this movie is awfuller then the original and then next version is even more stupid, and if they make a fourth, Hannable will probably be on the space shuttle. I give this a 3.",3,6,22,22 March 2001
Fifty Shades of Grey," Fifty shades of dysfunction and erotica!
","50 Shades of Grey is a provocative movie which pushes the forbidden theme! Not for the faint of heart or children, but not overly shocking. 50 Shades is not anymore shocking what one can see on H B O. With cable and internet smut standard are pushed to the point where the public has been desensitized. Directed and acted well. The viewer is interested in the characters and the character development. Shades digress into the sexually charged scenes and diverts into desegregation, which results into relationship conflict. The romantic themes of mystery, forbidden love, girl get boy and boy losses girl copy's the standards of the movie love story genre. Can the relationship be saved? Is Mr Grey redeemable? Questions which drive the movies story line. A love story with swanky fluff. Seven out of ten in the cheap thrills department. Many at the theater enjoyed the film.",7,1,4,11 March 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Not as good as The Dark Knight!
","The Dark knight Rises has a hard task living up to the predecessor The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises pales in comparison to the Dark Knight for the following reasons. The Dark Knight Rises did not have the excellent bad guy performance of Heath Ledger. There was no character dynamic in the movie compared to the last movie when Aaron Eckhart rivalled Christian Bale for the women. The characters in D K R were forgettable. The movie did not have enough of Christian Bale in it, which made the movie lack in dynamics that Bale brings to a film. In conclusion The Dark Knight Rises is just another comic book movie with special effects and a formulated script. The Dark Knight Rises to a six out of ten.",6,5,15,23 July 2012
Tombstone," Best Wester I've seen!!!
","This movie's casting is excellent, each actor executed his role perfectly.  Val Kilmer will never equal his performance as Doc Holliday, and Kurt Russel brought Earpp to life. I watched a show on Earpp's life before going to this movie, and it's script is historically close.  The unbelievable events in this movie is true, and life, sometimes, is more bazaar then fiction.  The way this story is crafted, and the director's feel for the era is well executed.  The movie left a feeling of being educated and entertained at the same time.",10,0,0,15 January 2001
Ben-Hur," Ages well
","This film ages well, and is still entertaining.  However, one can see the evolution of acting and it's improvement over the years.  Great script, excellent casting, and the chariot race is unbeatable.  This movie is spiritual, and the ending is spiritually motivating, leaving the viewer with a scene of hope and faith.",7,0,5,12 June 2001
Bull Durham," Funny but average
","Has its moments, but the movie sucks.  I hate the relationship part of the story.  The antics in the movie make me laugh.  I would watch it for 15 minutes, but not the whole movie.  Tim Robbens plays a very stupid guy. 5/10",5,3,9,9 September 2002
Signs," Big hat no cattle
","Spoiler!!!This film is all sizzle and no steak.  I watched the preview and expected more.  No bigtime special effects; UFO'S burning things, people melting, etc.  This film is done on a low budget, like the writer's other film Unbreakable.  The writer has some weak dialogs (ie the army guy) but the majority of the script is strong.  What works in this film results from the lack of special effects; not seeing the aliens, things that run around in the night, moving door knobs, noises, etc.  The locked in the basement scene made my heart race, what tension, but the ending is anti climatic after the basement scene.  I left the theatre wanting more, maybe part 2;  Maybe my expectations were too high. 6/10",6,1,3,2 August 2002
The Deer Hunter," Great cast no story
","This film has a great cast, which follows up with strong acting.  The story drags this film down, like a weight tied to my leg while I am trying too swim.  The story is weird, and confused.  The movie has no point.  I never seen a Polish wedding like this one with my relatives. 5/10",5,2,9,31 July 2002
Identity," You don't need a big budget to make a great picture
","This movie is influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.  A 03's version, with quite a few twists.  If you watch the film carefully you see, clues for the ending.  I caught a few, and missed others.  Nice to see something fresh, without a social message.  A film about what just is.  Interesting, but sad, I wonder if such things really happen?9 out of 10",9,0,2,27 April 2003
Live Free or Die Hard," Good summer movie
","For Canada Day my wife and I had a retro date weekend. Like many moons ago we went to the KFC and then to an action movie. I enjoyed Dieharder. The story is interesting, while the stunts were over the top, and I enjoyed the doses of humor. Dieharder had computer hackers attack the US. Bruce picks up a hacker and the wrong place wrong time story unfolds nicely. I say right place right time for America. The bad guys are bad, and the good guy is solid.The solid good guy Bruce Willis adapts and overcomes evil encounters with over the top stunts. The jet freeway deal, the traffic tunnel and ending stunts were great. I love the ending.Willis's sarcasm in dealing with the stress is a great tension reliever. I liked when he talks to himself in the annoyed tone via the tunnel scene. The humor is done at the right time for the wrong place plot.The directing and acting meld together well with the above mentioned Die-hard formula makes Dieharder entertaining. 7 out of 10. Worth seeing this summer. I wonder if this is the last of the 80's style action movies with Sly and Arnold out of the picture?",7,3,7,2 July 2007
Lucy," First half of the movie good, and second half stupid.
","First half of Lucy had an interesting story. Lucy is forced to carry drugs in her abdomen, and the drugs leak into her system. Lucy's story was similar to the movie Limitless. The protagonist becomes super smart. Well directed and acted with an interesting story line. I thought Lucy was going to be an entertaining movie. Regrettably, the second half of Lucy stalls! Lucy becomes a mix of The Matrix special effects and Residential Evil Video game story line. How can Lucy have god like powers from using more of her brain? Too much for the audience to believe/absorb. Second half, Lucy fights with video game special effects, which is a lazy way to end a story, which had no ending. I hate the idea of people becoming all knowing if there is no way people could grasp that knowledge. Five out of ten stars.",5,2,12,4 August 2014
Midway," Midway is a great movie!
","Midway is a great movie! The foreground of Midway is great the viewer got the feel of the Japanese war machine, and how Imperial Japan works. The intelligence community failures is displayed for Pearl and the character development of the U S characters proceeds as the movie progress. The Navy and the characters are perfectly created we the viewer, experience what the command structure and characters in the film. How strong the wives are. The confidence of a leader/ pilot has to be in-order to survive. Either do it or bounce off the Carrier. The command structure has to be trusting, yet strong. The middle of the movie is historically accurate. One experiences how military intelligence is a must for war. Many decision are made on educated gambles. If one did not know about World War 2 in the this film educates about Pacific Pear Harbor to Midway perfectly; The special effects are realistic! One experiences the nerve, and chaos of warfare, and the part with the brave pilot who hit two Carriers is memorable. The conclusion is great. One sees how luck, military mistakes, and listening to good intelligence is a must for battles. Midway is a well acted, directed, and executed. Much better than the original 1975 Midway, which side stories slowed the film. A must see. 9 stars.",9,5,7,6 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Watchable
","The Force Awakens is enjoyable to watch, but not original at all. The Force Awakens is a duplicate of the original Star Wars! The movie's script has another Death/planet star weapon which explodes. An escaped droid with a secret message. Another Darth Vader, which we can call mini Darth Vader. Awakens' story cumulates with another rebel attack ending. More light saber duels, an a character dies in Obe One fashion! However, not a bad film! What works well for The Force Awakens is: Retells the Star Wars story well. The beginning starts off strong with an evil dark side attack on a village. The introductions of new characters stirs excitement for the viewers. Who what they are and what they are doing? Preplexies the viewer. Regrettably Minus the new Vader, the new characters becomes stale and add little to the redundant story. What saves the storyline is the reintroduction of Hans Solo/Harrison Ford. Ford's charismatic performance save the stale script. Fisher and the rest of the old cast creates the old magic and momentum for the 2nd half The force awakens. The old cast ending creates excitement for next instalment. Worth watching! B B 8 is cute character worth watching. Fun to watch for a new generation of fans.",7,2,26,27 February 2016
Final Destination," This film is not as good as the second!
","The second film had a great car crash, and a strong beginning, but got weaker as the film continued.  The first film is wimpy, and the lead is a wimp also.  The film get stronger as it progresses, as if they where learning as they wrote the script.  I love the ending, and the films ending fit in with it philosophy.  Watch the second one first. 6/10",6,1,3,2 February 2003
The Purge," Interesting!
","The Purge is interesting, but not in a bad way! The Purge is an interesting movie with many themes. The storyline is about a family who lives in America and every once a year everything is legal for a 12 hour period. There viewer experiences many themes from the story. 1)Are humans nothing more than animals when all restraints are lifted? 2) People consist of the strong picking on the weak. Rich vs the poor. Neighbors pick on other neighbors when the opportunity arises.3)The idea that the purge cleans society of the unwanted. 4) Violence gets rid of vendettas. 5) The threat of violence keeps people in line because no bad boss or neighbor would live. The theme driven movie is enhanced by great acting, directing and a few interesting plot twists. Personally, I do not believe a lawless day could be viable. The whole city would burn down. I have to watch The Purge a second time to have an opinion. Seven out of ten.",7,2,4,12 June 2013
Munich," Nothing special
","Nothing Special. OK movie, started out strong. The film become too artish with the ending. I know the anxiety's were reflected, but I like the documentary feel of the beginning. Acting is perfect. The ending, what is with that? The dinner comment? I believe the actor wanted to escape his past at the ending. The commando part is good. A movie rental. Nothing special. OK film. I would not buy it. I wonder how real the film is? Not a date movie. Film in a dark tint, I wonder if such a back ground was for the mood of this film? No humor or release in the film. Comments about the policies and ideas of the people, in a political way.",6,1,4,5 March 2006
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Not as good as the first but still entertaining!
","The Purpose of The Hunger Games is to show that everyone is out for themselves and to trust no one! Resistance against the state is futile. Catching Fire has many counter themes which battle the divide and conquer strategy. The true act of defiance against the state from the original movie has manifested into cooperative defiance. The first part of the movie is back ground development to show the depravity of the sectors. The middle part of the movie is the crux of the story. In order to stamp out the idea of revolution a new game is made. One strike by Catines's Arrow will bring down the revolt, and show selfishness or self-sacrifice. The above mentioned moment question does happen during the games! Catching Fire bottom third is similar to The Empire Strikes Back with plot twists plot curves, and plot suggestions, which is a segue for part three. The movie is well written, directed and acted. Hoffman, and Sutherland have stand out roles which display how intellectuals, and those who know how to manipulate the media drive the machinery of government! Eight stars.",8,1,21,25 November 2013

","This film grows on the viewer, the first time I saw this film it reminded me of Goodfellas too much.  After, seeing the video a few times, I belong to a movie club, the movie rates as a classic.  Long movies usually become boring, however this story is easy to follow.  It is directed well, and acted well.  I read the book, and the film follows it closely, a few events changed because of time considerations and where shorting.  The film had to be long for it to reasonbly follow the book.  This is a interesting story, and the movie follows it accurately, and the viewer goes along the journey as he was there.

Too bad they keep copying it with the later movies.  We see a young Harrison Ford, and Alex, G do some of there best performances.  The story still captures my attention, and I can watch this film over and over.  I remember when I was eight, looking at night sky after my dad took me to this film,",8,1,2,22 March 2002
Hart's War," Sappy
","This film is so sappy I gave it a 3.  It has all the cliches, I have seen before.  Bruce Wills as the hard hearted leader who did it all for his men, the air man who just wants to make a difference, the officer who tries to make up for past mistakes, and the evil German commander.  This film is so sappy; it is time to get out the crying towel.  Everyone wants to sacrifice themselves.  The lead character is too preachy, and righteous, and I find the reason for this  is too hide the lack of story.  I left the theater and found no real point in the movie, it did not rap up into a big conclusion. Moreover, the court scene and the talking with his client was over kill. When we finally find out the plot twist, the movie dragged what should have been 15 minutes into an hour and an half.",3,9,14,16 February 2002
Cloud Atlas," Okay
","Cloud Atlas is a movie that has five stories running concurrently! The movie I believe is based on the space time continuum where past, present and future are all running concurrently in different dimensions. The movie tries to explain that we all are interconnected in the universe; where good deeds have a ripple effect! The characters face struggle and opposition in the battle between good and evil. Cloud Atlas explains the same story/themes over five different time periods to show a natural progression in the cycle of the universe. Cloud Atlas bounces back and forth through which could be hard to follow for some viewers, and the five stories makes for a long movie. I believe the way Cloud Atlas was directed and acted allowed the movie makers to pull it off as a big story which is hard to do.",6,11,30,28 October 2012
Thirteen Days," Great Kevin Costner Role
","Oh well I am a history buff, and watch all sorts of shows on the history channel.  I find historical movies interesting, and this one kept my attention.  I do not know how much of the film is factual, especially the fighting with the generals at the NSC, but the film documents who's who, and at what time events happened.  The factual spin makes this film work.  I like how Kevin Costner plays the old fashion type dad to bring reality to his character.  Bruce Greenwood played a realistic JFK. This movie, in my opinion, was one of Costner's best.",7,0,0,23 July 2001
300," Just OK
","I was taught by my history professor to never praise Sparta, but the Athenians instead. Sparta's militaristic, autocratic and closed society hurt growth more than it helped. I kept this in mind. I found the military strategy, planing and organization of the film excellent. CGI was way too much making the film like a comic book. Persia grew from the growth of other societies and won by scale according to the movie. I did not understand the king's denial when the deal was offered for Sparta to keep its own land and expand in exchange for use of services like their army. I guess there is a need for politicians. Gladiator, Troy, and Alexiader were better movies in different ways. There was a need to show more of the drudgery of Spartan life in the movie. Not a bad movie! 6 out of 10",6,0,2,5 August 2007

The mission has some problems and it takes a great effort to resolve them.  Good Ron Howard type of movie, but not a classic.",7,1,4,17 June 2001

","Not that John Wick was a classic but part two pales in comparison. I know the John Wick story is aka comic book/super hero style movie which will be thin on plot; Thin like a slice of roast beef served from a cheap relative . However, there is some good action scenes. Keanu Reeves looks, movie great as a physical actor! Regrettably, the story- line lags, which become laborious for the viewer to watch. Many of the action scenes are elongated to the point of boring. Way too many characters which are two dimensional. In fact so two dimensional the characters could fit into the adult film! Watchable. but I would give John Wick 2 a pass. John Wick 2 is about as original as the movie's title. 4 out of 10 stars.",4,4,8,24 March 2017

He was waiting in line from about 8 am on for his friends, I got to be number 11 in line for this film on the first day.  The line up was over 3 streets, and there were people with Darth Vader Masks, Light Sabers, etc.  It was more like going to an Oakland Raider game, than a movie.  The wait, and the build up did not disappoint the viewer.  This film was original, and not a copy of the first.  A plot that left the viewer hanging, and some great special effects.

The Ugly Truth," Not a bad movie.
","Not a bad movie! I like the movie. My wife's pick; I noticed the movie had a bigger women audience then men. I found the men in the audience did not mind this film. The protagonist in the film, plays a person who tells the Ugly truth about dating. In the end, he was right. The movie's message was about if one has a check list for the perfect mate, and he or she has to fit his or her mode then the relationship will not last; I see this thesis as the Ugly truth about love. The movie had a few funny parts, and a few Amerian Pie style humor in it. In the end, I would give The Ugly Truth a six out of ten. I think my wife would give the movie eight out of ten. Not a bad movie, but a rental.",6,1,6,28 July 2009
Gangs of New York," If you like stupid this film is for you
",This film has so many spots that do not make sense.  It has so many characters jumping back and forth to different sides that it was unbelievable.  Lewis stoled the show.  He was the only watchable element in this film.  Di Caprio did his usual C acting.  I do not know why this guy got into acting;  maybe he's related to someone.

The Cabin in the Woods," Stupid film but my kind of stupid!
","I really enjoyed watching 'The Cabin in the Woods'! Turn your brain off when watching 'The Cabin in the Woods' the movie is stupid but in a brilliant way! The movies concepts are so bizarre the viewer has an original script with new plot twists and devices which keeps the viewer enthralled. I never seen a horror movie begin like 'The Cabin in the Woods' has. I never seen a movie end like this one did! The script has a few social messages hidden into the film. One, society/media tries to control people, and fit them into typecast people. Two, there is a few people who are conscious of this, 3 d thinkers, and figure things out. 3 the movie has a low opinion of human nature and believes that we get what we deserve. Entertaining to watch! I give 'The Cabin in the Woods' an eight out of ten!",8,0,8,17 April 2012
Spectre," Been there done that before!
","Been there done that before. What worked: Spectre has some great over the top stunts. Spectre's script is fast paced. All the movie's scenes were well directed. What did not work: The acting had no strong stand out characters. Daniel Craig cannot create any comic relief as James Bond. The audience needs a comical break after too much tension. Craig cannot deliver a joke. Christopher Waltz's role was too small, and has no character development. A great actor Waltz who had no material to shine with. Not enough information about Spectre. What are they? What will they do? No idea! No clue creates story drag while watching. Always a count down with the Bond movies. Please stop doing this! Agh try a different ending. For a better story, and bad guys movie I suggest Man from Uncle for a better spy/agent experience. Left room for Spectre II. 6 out 10",6,1,4,16 November 2015
Braveheart," Good epic
","This film is a good epic, but not great, as many believe.  It is entertaining, and has outstanding acting.  The only weak link is the length, which bogs down the film.  A good scrip, but they could cut 20 minutes out of this film.  Mel Gibson, will be remembered as a great actor. I believe he has yet to perform his best work, and will act in many more successful roles. (he knows a stinker script when he see it, and his acting gets better with age)  I would rent this film, but hesitate to buy it. 7/10",7,1,4,5 April 2002
Mad Max: Fury Road," Middle of the Road!
","A middle of the Road forgettable movie: The hype was too big, and I can see why Gibson turned the movie down years ago. What worked: Tom Hardy hits the mark as the silent, and tormented Max. The director creates a strong visual rock video feel for Fury Road. The first fifteen minutes grabs my attention. What did not work: Once on the road the pursuit chase scene is way too long. A tiresome visual display of C G I. I miss the Gone in 60 second real car stunts! The bad guy characters are cartoonish. Hard for the viewer to relate and hate characters which are similar to the Transformers. What saves Fury Road is the Max character we all know no matter how hardened Max has become there still is a heart of gold in the man. Six out of ten stars. Nothing special here.",6,10,20,18 May 2015
Gladiator," A solid 7
","This is a good movie, not a great movie.  Better to see on the big screen, and it is worth the 8.50 I paid for. I am a follower of history, and when I entered the movie line for the film I hoped this would not turn into a either or  hollywood or politically correct film, in order to have a believable script.  It did, the story was a little hollywood, but gave a good description of the brutality, and views of the time. I will not spoil the story, but it is sort of out a Shakespearian play, with revenge being the main motivator in the story line.  This give you a good feel for the brutality of the time, and the sort of honor that follows this hypocrisy. A good epic. The budget was big enough to make this a believable epic, and the action is done with perfection.  It's nice to see lesser name actors in films these day, because it give you bigger over all budget for the film instead of watching some one get payed 30 million and it hurts the rest of the film. The film wasn't too long either, and that is good considering how long it was.  I gave it a 7 maybe, because it didn't grab me, but if I watch it another time I will probably like it more.",7,0,1,6 June 2000
Donnie Darko," This movie is starting to smell; it's a stinker
","Donnie Stinker would be a better title. I know some of the stupid stuff in this movie I heard in the news, but the rest is time space crap. I understand the ending and Donnie Darko is a hero, and I like that. Time lines or fate, can affect ones outcome, and this is what the script is about. 5/10.",5,3,8,30 April 2002
The Wedding Singer," Very 80's
","I do not dislike this film, and some of it is very 80's.  It is no Caddy Shack, but it not Vacation 2 either.  I like the Don Johnson, and Billy Idol part.  The Van Halen shirt bit was good also.  It is an okay comedy, but has it slow parts.  Worth watching on TV.  Survey says 6/10",6,0,2,6 November 2002
Back to the Future," Great movie
","One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought 'Back to the Future' at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films.",10,157,182,28 November 2004
Goodfellas," What can I say
","This movie is alot like the movie Mean streats, but with a higher budget. I read the book 'Wise guy' and the movie follow the book well.  When I read a book I have piture go threw my head of what I am reading, and this moive did this with out myself having to read the book again. Beliveable, and directed in the manner of the author telling the story.  The art of story tell is a lost one with many the entertainment industry marketing for a public with  a short attenion span, but in the world of Jerry Springer, and professional wrestling, where the product is directed at a 2 second attention span this moive cuts down the quick fix mentaliy of our time. This is a well crafted film, which has a story told and unravels in proper fourm.  This is a nice break from factory made fourmulated moives where you can guess the script 10 minitues into the movie.  Like the music industry where all the county music and dance music sounds the same, alot of movie go this route,this movie stands out from the repetition.",9,0,1,11 January 2001
The Bourne Supremacy," Lags behind the first film!
","Spoilers!!!What a bad summer for movies, hopefully the fall schedule will improve.  The film has a couple of huge flaws.  One, the director, I can understand some of the shakey camera work in trying to create anxiety, with fast choppy thinking.  Real life events can appear to the mind in this way, with the sensory overload.  Trouble with the camera work is too shakey, were the viewers see nothing, and too long where the viewer either gets sick or confused.  The style can be executed better.  Two, the reason for the attempt on Bourne's life was weak, unless Bourne 3 will reveal a different reason.  A huge let down for the climax.  The crowd scenes, car chases, and fights with Bourne's wet work rival is the strong part of this movie.  The ending saves the lack of story, and weak character in the first half.  Why would they kill off all the strong characters from the first movie?  The Donald Rumsfield look alike is believable, and the brush cut, military/republican conservative looking agent gave realism for this series. This is like killing M in the Bond series.  I hope Damon will not have this Clariss/Hannabil relationship with the new CIA women.  Get a more original idea.  7 out of 10",7,0,2,29 July 2004
The Great Gatsby," Probably a better book than a movie.
","Probably a better book than a movie. Watching Gatsby reminds me of a few English Literature book's I read then I watched the movie. Good book, but the translation turns flat as a movie. Gatsby is not a bad movie, but not a good movie either. The movie is well directed, acted, and has a strong cast. Gatsby's themes of owning everything, but not having what you really want. Reaching to far. Chasing after a women who's in it for her self. Who are your real friends? Living an empty life. Great themes which any English major would study. However, Gatsby is about a man who pushed self promotion. Like all loud, and attention oriented personalities people eventually grow tired of the noise. I found Gatsby a bit long. Gatsby is a six out of ten stars. Net flick it.",6,1,3,15 May 2013
The Proposal," Not a bad film.
","My wife wanted to go to 'The Proposal' really bad; Well, (I want to see a macho Rambo VS The Transformers film) and I went kicking and screaming along with her. No not really just joking, I do not mind Ben Afflick as an actor. The story is interesting and 'The Proposal' has a nice fast pace to it. Sandra plays a great boss from hell. There is some over the top humor in it. A good date night movie. I give the film a seven or eight out of ten. Tho Rambo VS The Transformers sounds cool I think my wife would rather have me buy her this film instead. I would not mind watching 'The Proposal' again on video or VOD the movie one night. Good movie.",8,1,4,30 June 2009
13 Hours," Realistic, gritty and gut wrenching.
","Realistic, gritty and gut-wrenching. 13 Hours is one of 2016 better movies! What worked: Realistic characters. The security team is hard driven Alph males go getters which are proactive people. The security team characters have nothing to prove, but need to decompress guy in style fashion! We see how such tough guys just react during stressful situations, but crash when the adrenaline come down. One gets a feel for the people. The politics, and short sightedness of of government official creates tension and clashes with the security team emulates the realistic working environment of the C I A. The government-less state where the local security could be your enemy displays the difficulties and fears for the dangerous security mission. The ending where, 13 Hour's creates a realistic gritty portrayal of the secret soldiers who gut wrenchingly disobeyed orders and fought sacrificed saving many, but not the ambassador during the Benghazi attacks. What did not work: 13 hours gives little input or reason about the incompetence, and lack of actions resulting help not arriving. Maybe time constrains, or not knowing why, is the reason for 13 Hours lack of answers. I would like to read the book now and find out more. 9 out of 10. Best movie of this type scene the Hurt locker.",9,3,11,7 February 2016
Cinderella Man," A solid 8 out of 10 Great Movie
","A solid 8 out of 10; a great movie. I believe Sylvester Stallone was influenced by the true story and one can see Rocky in Ron Howard's film. Great directing! One feels the hardships of the depression. The desperation of the families and the hopelessnes of unemployment. Russel Crow's method acting pays out with the mannerism of a real boxer. The actor who plays Max Bear steals the show. Boxing will always have Mike Tysons, and Mr T. Max Bear is a nasty in love with himself boxer. Reminds the viewer of Creed in Rocky with the same ring behaviour, except a bit meaner. I do not want to ruin the film by revealing more of the story. Watch C man in the movie theater. a first film to watch on rental night. 8 out of 10. I will buy this film",8,2,5,8 June 2005
Valkyrie," good movie
","The surprise of 2008, the critics downplayed this movie. Surprisely the movie is much better than the reviews. The only thing that would of made this movie believable is they needed German accents. Cruise was just too American sounding. The part I liked best about the movie is that it gave the viewer the feeling of what it was like to live in a police state. The better movies are always the ones that follow the events closely. Real life movies are always better than fiction. This movie is a 7 or 8 stars out of 10. Worth seeing in the theater. The actor (Tom Wilkinson) from Emily Rose is in this movie. He plays the German that plays both sides. A lot of British actors in this film. If the plan would of worked, I wonder if the war would have ended sooner.",7,2,5,1 January 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Like theTV show
","I only watch 23 minutes of the movie. I will give it back to my boss tomorrow. Just like the TV show. I can watch a half hour show, but not a whole movie. More of the same old same old. I think they are trying to milk the series for all its worth. I can not give a fair review, but I was not overly excited. 3 out of 10 donuts for this one. I would rather watch Old School or Semi-Pro for 2 hours than this. To TV ish. At least I did not have to pay for it. Reminds me of the X files movie. No one went to see X Files either. Go see Drillbit Taylor instead. I like Owen Wilson. Maybe even rent Wedding crashers. The Simpson did it even last a week in the theater.",3,3,6,2 April 2008
Draft Day," okay but sappy movie!
","Draft Day is well written, and directed movie. The story and characters are okay. Kevin Costner deals with the pressures of the owner, coach, and personal problems when dealing with the N F L draft. The question of can the General Manager create his own team? Costner is forced to deal, and create more deals to get the team Costner believes will win. Rival general managers try to out wit each other. Personal clashes, and questions arise. Is the first pick overall Callahan the real deal or a bust? Will the injured quarterback be able to return? These are the un-measurable x factors of sport. One experiences the pressures and uncertainty of N F L management. One sees the manager's success is based on both skill and luck! Six out of ten stars.",6,2,8,20 April 2014
The Wizard of Oz," A classic from another era!
","A classic from another era! I remember, as a child, watching The Wizard of Oz at least once a year. A great cast. Judy Garland's plays the great innocent girl. There is no place like home is a memorable line. The character's the cowardly lion, tin man, and scarecrow are memorable. A great fantasy with a villain the witch of the west. I will get your little dog too says it all. Having to find the Wizard who is the reluctant Hero creates the home away form home back to home story. The Star Wars of the 40's era film. My sister told me that half the film got burned and The Wizard of Oz middle was filmed in color. Begins in black and white, middle is color, and end in black and white adds a neat effect of a never world. Never get stuck in a tornado or you could end up in Oz. Let's not for get the little dog Totto was a great little extra for a film that added many great details for a classic film. Nine out of 10 stars.",9,3,4,20 October 2017
Dodgeball," Very 80's
","This film is very 80's the writers must have growen up in the 80's. Music,  Ben's style, and the jym is very much 80's.  Add chuckNorris and the humor style from Johnhy  Daneriously you got retro.  The jokes were funny, and the story is stupid, but it all works.  Alotof knee in the midsection jokes, and jokes about American pop culter.  I like the ESPN 8 idea, and the Jim McMahonanchor.  This film is all right.  I hope it last the test of time, but itcould be another comedy that is forgoten in 2 years.  I give it a 7out of 10.  Worth going to the movie theartier.   Any movie with William Shanter in it can not be that bad.  He has got to be theworlds most famious Canadian.",7,0,1,20 June 2004
Rock Star," Realistic
","Spoiler!!!!  I found this movie realistic.  I know the critics will hate this.  When I was a teenager, the media and boomers hated heavy metal; it did not reflect the Beatles culture of the past.  In fact it destroyed it, like what Rap did to metal.  I grew up in the 80's and wondered what it would of been like to live that Rock Star dream, of over excess.  This film is great as a almost documentary on the life.  This film shows how much fun fame, excess, and the continual high is, but shows the realities of excess, like too much water for a plant one starts to rot, and burns out.  It would be fun to rock on 15 000 fans, and live with the adulation of millions, but it has a cost.  The cost of excess on personal relationships, on one's values, what one is really expected to do in order to fit it.  The pecking order of the band, and what the members really want.  The lead character finds out the old lead singer is gay, and lived a quiet life, not this heterosexual full steam, party and die image.  In the end, the Roadie told of his chance at normality, and how he gave up a wife and kids for these demands.  Chris(Izzy) chose to live normality, instead of being with some stripper who wanted her turn on the ride before she had to go to work.  As in all scenes, we see that the fad of metal die and a more wimpy grunge era begin.  Instead of fading away with it, he choose to be with the one he loves.",7,1,2,8 September 2001
The Martian," Surprise of the year.
","The Martian is the movie surprise of 2015. Well written story. The viewer is compelled with anticipation of what will happen next. The problem of a stranded astronaut. The crew which left the astronaut and N A S A all try to solve the problem. The triple layered story is intertwined perfectly. The director (Scott) gives a good pace and feel for the social, political, and science problems of the story. Well acted. Matt Damon perfectly can physically act and create solitude scenes with no dialogue. Bean and Daniels create the problem solving interchange of N A S A. Jessica Chastain shines as the leader of the space crew. Chastains strong personality kills it in every scene. The extra character development of the characters using science and deductive reasoning makes for an interesting story. The movie is a bit long but worth it. 8 out 10",8,2,5,22 November 2015
The Fighter," Okay movie.
","The Fighter is a movie that one has to see more than once. One will pickup more details from a second screening. The acting is strong. Everyone played their characters perfectly. I found some of the characters extremely annoying, which made a few scenes hard to watch. The protagonist's mother and dysfunctional brother were very hard to watch. It seemed that these two characters were all about themselves. The story is based from real life. I find real life stories more entertaining than fiction. The movie is well directed, and has no slow spots. I cannot believe how much weight Christian Bale lost for this role! I give The fighter a 7 out of 10.",7,2,3,14 February 2011
The Island," One of the better movies this summer
","If anyone reading this review can remember Space 1999, which was on the space network for awhile, one can see where the Island got the set and costumes from. Not a bad movie. I like the idea of the island to keep the people under control. The rest of this is interesting like the movie Free Jack of many moons ago. Good acting and directing. The producer (Bay) makes very surreal movies. I don't understand the black guy, who is a hired gun, actions at the end of the movie. Bean always plays a bad guy. What would one do if they met themselves? See The Island in the movie house. 7 out of 10. Better than stealth a weak summer for movies. Wasn't there a movie called The Island with Michael Cain, which was on TBS a while back?",7,0,3,1 August 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," a alright movie
","The preview make the movie look too stupid. I thought the movie would be another Anchorman. A movie can be too much Will Ferel, like the Anchorman. This movie had a right mix, and the humor is spread out evenly. I did not like the comments on J C, for years of Catholic school I would be careful on such humor. Too much adverting in the movie. One restaurant chain is mention at least 5 time. I like the chain. Turn your brain off the movie is OK. 7 out of 10. If you miss it that is OK rent it. I like how the south has no problem joking about itself. Humor is hard to do! Ferel keeps getting better with time. I can see Ferel doing a few old Bill Murry roles. I like the I am on fire bit. The video game part is good. A bad summer for movies.",7,0,3,10 August 2006
Semi-Pro," Funy movie
","Read the old ABA web page and find out how much of the movie is true. Semi pro has many influences from the ABA. The slam dunk style, bear wrestling, and cow milking contests were some of the funny material which made a great movie. Real life is funnier than fiction. Semi pro has great material too work with. A goofy movie with a no better goofy actor than Will Ferrell. Ferrell pulls off a hard acting job of a fly by the seat of his pants owner/coach/manager and player etc ABA operator. The acting and directing is great but the true star which shines is the script, which is influenced by real life. Low ball humor, not for the whole family. 8 out of 10. My buddy Dax and his wife enjoyed the movie. What does the Tropics have to do with Flint, Michigan? I think the team moved from Florida. Funny the Nuggets almost went to the final in their first year with the NBA. I guess that is why the NHL stripped the WHA Jets of their team before they merged. Just an after thought.",8,8,10,13 March 2008
The Godfather," perfect
","This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.",10,664,988,16 May 2001
