Requiem for a Dream," Horrible, but terrific
","In just a few words, I would describe Requiem as the most moving film I´ve ever seen. But it was also the most disgusting. I had been warned, so I sat at the last row of seats in the theater. Anyway, I was like in a dream fuzz for more than an hour after the movie had ended and the characters had sunken into hell. And it wasn´t a sweet dream.I have listed my 100 favourites movies. This is my no. 10. But if you like ordinary American happy ending films, this may not be your cup of tea.",10,0,1,1 March 2002
