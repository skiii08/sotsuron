Hereditary," An interesting portrayal of schizophrenia
","The clues are all there. She shows nearly all of the symptoms. I think it was even mentioned that either her dad or her mother had schizophrenia (they were both mentally ill anyway) and I believe that's what hereditary refers to.The son also shows signs of mental illness and of course he would be prone to that after what happened.The husband seemed to be a therapist but maybe that's me reading into it. When he stopped playing along she torched him, and as they show with the chairs there was a struggle.The whole movie is shown from her and the sons point of view as the horror of their hereditary condition runs its course. Of course I don't think there ever was a Joan. When she goes to the movies the husband just accepts that she's going to the movies alone with no further questions so it's obviously there's a pattern where she leaves the house. Probably for the cult meetings.Not sure if this is all obvious or far fetched but I think it was interesting. Not really much of a review, more of an analysis but I hope you think it's interesting anyway.As a movie. Not really all that great. Felt like the girls tick was supposed to mimic other movies that had similar things, e.g. the clap from the Conjuring. Also the foreshadowing just wasn't that subtle. Teacher:'does the fact that the outcome is predetermined make it better or worse? Yes Steve what do you think' 'umm better?' 'Wrong, Sarah?' 'THE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE ARE ALL GONNA DIE NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO!!!' 'ahhh yes that's the answer I was looking for'. And sure it was a bit scary but it feels like there was no hope. I was convinced they were all going to die so why root for anyone?",5,1,1,30 May 2020
