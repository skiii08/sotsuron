The Rock," One of the greatest actions films ever made.
","I won't say there is is just one word to describe this movie, there is several, and there are all positive. This is fantastic.  The direction from Michael Bay is new and classy (although really MTV influenced) and the actors carry the film.  Standout performances come from Michael Biehn and Ed Harris, but just about everyone who has a line in the film is cast perfectly. The action itself is excellent.  It just hangs on the line between being stupid and exciting.  Again, through the direction and pacing, the fight sequences are vastly improved.If you have not seen this, you have not lived.",10,1,1,12 January 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Without a doubt, the most original film of the decade
","I recently just went to see this film for the second time, and I was still shocked by it.  The films greatest power is that it draws you in on a deep level, which cannot be avoided.  The fist time I saw this, I was laughing through most of it, until the end, which is the most scary climax I think I have ever seen on film.  This film is a gift to movie watchers everywhere, as it encourages you to use your imagination in a world filled with CGI filled eye candy.  To put it simply, your enjoyment of this film will very much depend on your imagination.  This film gives you the paper and brush, and you want to draw a picture.",Null,0,0,1 December 1999
Fight Club," Violent, Funny, Sad, action packed, a great film!
","Fight Club is an incredible film which, along with Se7en and The Game, propels David Fincher into my fave directors list.This is a fantastic satire on modern life and living, which succeeds through great acting, a great script and, as already mentioned, good direction.The movie flies along with twists and turns that keep the interest alive, while managing to ask questions about society, as it provides us with fight sequences to keep eye candy people (or yobs) happy.  So everybody wins.Watch it, it is excellent, without doubt one of the finest films of 1999.",10,0,1,17 January 2000
From Dusk Till Dawn," A modern day classic
","Some people may be shocked to think that this would be considered a modern day classic, but it is.  This film is fantastic.The premise sees Clooney and Tarantino as brothers in crime who escape jail and are trying to cross the boarder.  When they stop at a bar to meet some friends.......I will not give away the plot twist, the sayings or the ending that all make this film great.  Let me just say that it contains some kick ass direction, is scripted to perfection and has some of the coolest fight sequences this side of The Rock (1996).SEE IT NOW",Null,0,0,19 January 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," A worthly last Film for Stanley Kubrick
","I saw this movie with my friend, on the 27th September 1999, several weeks after the premiere.  It was fantastic.  The acting, enhanced by Kubrick's usual tight direction is superb and the music, whilist very simplistic, does a wonderful job.  My friend believes this to be the greatest film of the year so far.  I would only go as far as second (Existanz) but I would empore any fan of movies to watch it and for Stanley Kubrick lovers this is a total must.",Null,0,0,30 September 1999
Army of Darkness," Very Cool, I want some sugar baby!
","This film is really more of a straight out comedy then the other two Evil Dead films, and it is the better for it.  The Director has managed to bring the trilogy round from horror to comedy very well, and this film contains some classic moments and quotes of outright weridness (My personal fave remains the 'this...is...my...boomstick!!') Fans of the first two should enjoy this, and Bruce is very good in it, playing everything just right.And now to the ending.  I live in England so I have seen the international ending which is quite downbeat, and fits into the film nicely.  However, the video release of the film contains the other shop ending at the end, which I have not seen.  I have to say, I believe the more downbeat ending would be a fitting climax to Ash, considering the early events of last two films, but you shall have to see for yourself.Watch it, but like Evil Dead two, a few drinks wouldn't hurt.",Null,1,1,18 January 2000
Evil Dead II," A true Horror fan's film.
","I recently re-visited the Evil Dead Trilogy over Christmas.  This is a good movie if you are a horror fan.  The Gore effects are cool and there are many 'classic' sequences such as the famous scene involving a chainsaw and Ash's hand.A remake of the original, this is one of those rare films that is able to be both a horror film and a dark comedy as well.  Unlike Peter Jackson's excellent 'Braindead' and 'Bad taste' though, this film uses slightly more subtle methods to bring across its underlying themes.All in all, this is good fun.  Its not the classic that many horror fans would tell you it is, but have a few drinks and you'll love it.",Null,0,0,13 January 2000
