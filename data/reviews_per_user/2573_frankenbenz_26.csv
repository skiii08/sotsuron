National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Guilty Pleasure
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/I wanted to hate this movie, I truly did. I put it on hoping to be subject to a big budget piece of crap that I could tear to shreds. Nick Cage is a guy that makes himself easy to hate: loud, obnoxious, hammy, bad hair plugs and a career thanks to nepotism. But on the flip side, he's been in some great films and was hard not to love in those roles: Vampire's Kiss, Rumblefish, Birdy, Wild at Heart and guilty pleasures Face Off and The Rock. Even recently he's done some respectable work: The Weatherman and Lord of War. But before I get completely off track, I just finished watching National Treasure: Book of Secrets ...and, reluctantly, I liked it.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a great movie, but when you've got three academy award winners (Cage, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren) along with Harvey Keitel, Ed Harris and Bruce Greenberg, you can't help but at least consider it a great popcorn movie. OK, name recognition aside, Ed Harris is not worth mentioning here since he mails in a lazy performance where it seems the director (notorious hack John Turteltaub) kept forgetting to remind Harris he started the movie speaking with a faux southern drawl.Overall, NT is a hybrid of Indiana Jones and The DaVinci Code, so much so you can imagine exactly how the pitch went down in some studio execs office. What makes this movie work are many of the same things that made Indy and DaVinci work: pseudo-historical facts, conspiracy theories, puzzles, riddles, suspenseful life or death consequences in secret chambers and a mother lode at the end of the exhaustive trail.No this isn't high art. No this film is barely worth the effort I'm putting forth to write about it. This movie was fun: it invited me to participate in the puzzle solving, it revisited some interesting historical periods and it whet my appetite for some fascinating, clandestine conspiratorial details. At worst, this movie is a lazy parents excuse to educate kids with what would otherwise be found in boring history textbooks. What else would you expect from Disney?",7,0,1,13 May 2008
Frost_Nixon," A Howard Movie w/o archetypes?!!
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/Perhaps the best American film of 2008, Ron Howard's Frost / Nixon is a fascinating pseudo- documentary recounting the infamous interviews David Frost (Michael Sheen) conducted with resigned President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) in 1977. Adapted from playwright Peter Morgain's play, the screenplay ingeniously co-opts the wholly satisfying formula of a Rocky- esquire sports melodrama, only this time, the boxing takes place on a figurative chess board. What makes this movie so utterly fascinating to watch is the constant mental maneuvering between the adversarial leads, where Nixon takes on the invincible air of a seasoned champion, and Frost the outclassed, long-shot newcomer.For a number of reasons, this entire project was destined to be a success long before the cameras ever started to roll. Not only had the source material the good fortune of being polished to a brilliant sheen through its successful run in the theater, the two lead actors had the benefit of reprising the same roles they had been playing in the same play. Langella and Sheen deliver flawless and thoroughly convincing performances, both of them having mastered their roles long before the film was ever green-lit. Howard too has the upper hand on the material, much of it dealing with the inner workings of TV production, since his entire life has been spent either in front of the camera or behind it. It's unlikely any other director would be better suited to direct this material. The end result is unquestionably Howard's best work as helmer, thanks to a screenplay that is unlike anything else he's ever brought to the big screen; Frost / Nixon is a complex character study of two men, both equally compelling and both plagued by their own unique demons. There are no good guys or bad guys in Frost / Nixon and, despite his evil deeds, Nixon is given what feels like a fair shake...perhaps one he doesn't even deserve.",8,2,5,3 January 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Does a bigger Hulk make for a better movie?
","Edward Norton not only stars as Bruce Banner but pulls double duty as screenwriter, picking up where Zak Penn left off. Norton boasts being a Marvel kid while growing up and says he always loved the mythic dimension and contemporary themes of the Hulk. He also claims to be well versed on the original TV series, a nod I was hoping hinted towards a movie driven by character development, as opposed to (what Penn's work has previously exhibited) large scale spectacles of action.The film's opening credit sequence establishes ties to the TV series by replicating Banner's gamma ray accident, utilizing identical equipment and a few signature shots. Later on we're even treated to a cameo from Lou Ferrigno (who also voices this version of the Hulk), but once we jump into Banner's current situation as a fugitive hiding out in a Brazilian favela, the divide between the TV series and the movie starts to widen.Before long, General Ross (William Hurt) has caught a whiff of Banner's scent and dispatches a commando team led by über-soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to capture the outlaw scientist. Banner's concentrated efforts (meditation, jiu-jitsu) to keep the beast within from rearing its big, ugly, green head are wasted when the commando's push become a vicious shove in the darkened bowels of a Brazilian pop bottling plant. From the shadows, the Hulk emerges and shatters nearly everyone and everything around him including any potential for realism this movie may have had.Once the cartoony Hulk emerges, it displaces Banner's tortured struggle for normalcy as the focal point of the movie. That's not to say Norton doesn't get his share of screen time, but by the time the third act rolls around and Roth's English accented Russian soldier morphs into a hulk-like beast of his own, very little happens aside from things being smashed, blown up and punched at for the remainder of the movie. I might have even enjoyed all this mayhem if it didn't all look so incredibly animated, which (of course) it was.When you get to a point where you feel like you're watching a video game instead of a movie, there seems to be a disconnect. At this point, the characters you've been asked to invest into are bankrupted and the movie loses whatever potential it had to connect on any profound or engaging levels. Once the CG trumps the real world, I wondered if, despite its campiness, the Lou Ferrigno Hulk was a better alternative to the big-budget, physics defying cartoon Hulk before me now? There's no question the 70's series suffers from its campiness and budgetary constraints, but at least it managed to create a world where Banner was a compelling character worthy of holding my attention week after week. Is asking a $125 million dollar production to develop complex characters too much to ask? Is it easier making special FX and CG laden spectacles? Is it really a surefire formula for big box office? I'm sure Norton would beg to differ and based on the fact approximately 70 minutes of character driven footage is slated to be released on the inevitable Blu-Ray, maybe we'll be able to judge for ourselves whether character really is more compelling than CG.As it is, this installment of the Hulk leaves as much to be desired as Ang Lee's did back in 2003. Neither movie is terrible and both have their merits, but each one is incomplete and ultimately unsatisfying for their own unique reasons. In my humble opinion, Bill Bixby still holds the crown as the most complex and engaging Hulk on the block. Hard to believe 1970's low budget camp could out hustle a mega-budget, star laden block buster...but it does. I guess small is often better than big, even if we're talking about a hulk.",6,1,3,14 June 2008
Miracle," You Ess Eh! You Ess Eh!
","I don't like words like genius or miracle. Yet to my disdain these are popular words that get thrown around with reckless abandon. These days practically everyone with a pulse is a genius and anything remotely positive ends up labeled a miracle. I suppose we need something to believe in in these days, so it shouldn't come as a surprise hyperbole is becoming as common as hybrids on our roadways. Nobody wants to believe in miracles (or geniuses) more than Americans and if there aren't any immediately available, then why not revisit the past where the almighty red, white and blue shone like a blinding beacon of hope. No bigger evil comes to mind (with heartfelt apologies to terrorists) than the big red evil of the former Soviet Union and there's no better metaphor for winning the Cold War than beating those damn Russkies on a frozen sheet of ice where men do battle with skates and sticks. Yes I'm talking about hockey and if the Americans know one thing about hockey that would surely be that they beat the Commies at the 1980 Olympics (and went on to win the gold medal). In fact, I think it may very well be the only thing Americans know about hockey.It may be almost 30 years since the Team U.S.A. underdogs pulled off this major upset, but calling hard work, orchestrated team work and a refusal to quit a miracle is the equivalent of calling Gavin O'Connor's Miracle a masterpiece. Masterpiece status aside, the on-ice action is exceptionally well shot, with an incredible attention to detail and authenticity. Perhaps the best things about this movie is the director's decision to cast real hockey players in all the major roles, all of whom not only do an impressive job of acting, they also take on the brunt of all the stunt work.Typical of the sports melodrama genre, Miracle suffers from a few too many moments of pulled heart strings. The one trick O'Connor goes to too many times are the telegraphed reaction shots of secondary characters in the crowd. Annoyingly, Goaltender Jim Craig's father gets so many of these shots you can't help but pray for a deflected puck to pluck him in his sickingly over expressive face. On top of that, O'Connor makes an odd choice of closing the movie with an overly weighty voice over from Russell, a choice that practically undermines the relatively straight faced restraint characteristic of the rest of the movie. All in all, this is an entertaining movie, especially for hockey fans. A miracle? Not quite, but definitely something worth cheering about.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",7,0,2,18 July 2008
Stop-Loss," Stop. Please. Stop. I'm at a Loss.
","Over acted, heavy handed, full of speeches, preachy, on the nose, and over stylized in a way only MTV could be guilty of, Stop-Loss is agit-prop garbage. I expected a lot more with talented young actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but Screenwriter/Director Kimberly Peirce does a hatchet job of portraying the ill effects of war on American youth. I'm sure she did some work researching the Iraq war and the young men fighting in it, but you'd never guess it from watching Stop-Loss. In many ways this mess reminded me of Catherine Hardwicke's Lords of Dogtown, an equally inept, overly stylized, TV movie-like waste of solid subject matter.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",4,7,13,17 July 2008
Alien: Resurrection," Make it stop...please!
","You can't make a good movie without a good screenplay and thanks to the adolescent emptiness penned by TV hack Joss Whedon, this movie isn't just bad, it's horrible. Whedon seems to have a Star Wars hard-on for wisecracking space smugglers who save the day and AR is no exception. How many hackneyed one-liners can you cram into a movie? I lost count after 'Who do I have to f*** to get off this boat.' This isn't a franchise buoyed by timely wisecracks and Whedon's corny writing not only undermines Ripley, but it singlehandedly destroys AR. Considering the abilities of Jeunet and Khondji, who do add a visual flair to this otherwise waste of time, this film is proof positive that Mr. Whedon should stick to writing campy TV shows in lieu of destroying worthwhile movie franchises.",2,1,5,2 February 2008
Juno," If only I were as cool...
","Ever wish you could say the perfect thing every moment of your life? Screenwriter Cody Diablo pens a world where your wish is her characters command. After the first viewing, I was sold...after a few more viewings I'd rather have my ears stabbed by Celine Dion than sit through this hipfest again. Not only is the dialog painfully clever, most of the wall-to-frikkin-wall soundtrack is adolescent hipster pop-rock garbage. Remember the band Cub? If you're as haunted by their cloyingly amateurish Shonen Knife-ness as I was, then you'll loathe listening to the preenie angst chimed throughout Juno. A shame since great bands like B&S have songs cutting into the over abundance of squeaky juvenilia. Best Picture nomination? Hard to believe THIS was chosen over Superbad, let alone a film like The Assassination of Jesse James. I really do hate watching films that feel like a window into the screenwriter's slave-like devotion to cool.",6,26,54,24 January 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Lord of the Onion Rings
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/You can't seem to turn a corner these days without hearing about Guillermo del Toro's imagination. 'From the imagination of...' is the tagline of choice used to sell all things GDT and while his movies are usually set in mythical worlds with fantastic characters, are they really all that imaginative or simply reinvented retellings of other, far more imaginative yarns? From the prologue through to the end credits, GDT's latest offering, Hellboy II: The Golden Army seems to be a mixed bag of fantasy, all of which we've seen before: one part Tolkien, one part Gilliam, one part George Lucas and one part Ridley Scott. Like Lucas, GDT seems more interested in showing off his imagination than he is interested in telling an engaging story. Some scenes in HB2 play out like the Cantina sequence in Star Wars, others feel like plagiarized out takes from The Lord of the Rings, the production design looks to be borrowed from Brazil, Alien and Blade Runner. So what do I make of GDT's imagination? I'd say it's very inspired as opposed to very original.Pan's Labyrinth, although superior to HB2, also wears its influences a little bit too literally. With so much going on, PL is practically indistinguishable from the work of Lewis Carroll, Jim Henson and the Brothers Grimm. While there is little doubt Del Toro is a technically astute and visually compelling director, his brand of storytelling palatable and easy to digest, it really is a stretch to consider his work original, or truly imaginative. Whether you dissect Cronos, The Devil's Backbone or even more commercial outings such as Mimic or Blade II, Del Toro's work can best be described as a kid in a cinematic candy store, picking, choosing and recycling the work of his many influences. This isn't an entirely bad thing, and Del Toro (not unlike Quentin Tarantino) can always hide behind the time honored adage 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.' Flattering or not, GDT proves with Hellboy 2, there is no substitute for the real thing.",5,0,4,13 September 2008
Life of Pi," A Pi In The Sky Story
","www.eattheblinds.comWith the exception of Oliver Stone's ten-part mini-series The Untold History of the United States, no two films from 2012 do a better job at depicting what's wrong with the world today, than Craig Zobel's Compliance and Ang Lee's Life of Pi. Like the perfect wine pairing, these films should be watched back-to-back to bring out each one's full spectrum of flavor and insight. Don't make the mistake I did of watching Compliance first, better yet, save it for the second course -- a dish that will cool your palate after choking down Lee's turd-warm appetizer.The Life of Pi is a story achingly familiar, not for the subject matter itself, but in the way it is presented to us -- this is a cozy narrative formula audiences have gobbled up for decades, and based on Pi's critical reception it seems to be a taste no one is tiring of. Like Forrest Gump and countless other epic Hollywood yarns, Pi takes you on a magical, moral journey, a fiction tethered to the present in wholly unnecessary bouts of present-day exposition (presumably for those in the audience not paying strict attention). We are witness to the exotic and fantastic voyage of yesteryear by our humble narrator, told in CG-rich flashbacks, all in the name of getting the empty vessel of the aspiring writer (aka the audience) to a point where God is accepted. Unfortunately, this leap of faith comes after a Shaggy Dog twist reveals to us that the primrose path we've been led down, was in fact tended with manure. But fear not, since our heroic narrator has taken the initiative of convincing us the true story is so horrible, we will blithely prefer the flowery fiction he himself has succumbed to, so long ago. The last few times I remember a Hollywood film attempting to convince me fiction was preferable to reality was Tim Burton's Big Fish and Jeremy Leven's Don Juan De Marco. Perhaps I can forgive these two films for selling me on love and compassion, but Pi is selling us God...an entirely different can of worms.If after being misled for two plus hours you're still not sold on 'God' then you might be asking yourself: why exactly would the story of a tiger on a boat really be better than the gritty realist drama of four desperate humans on a lifeboat? I suppose the answer to why so many would prefer fiction over fact is perfectly presented in the hard to watch 'Inspired by True Events' Compliance. When a complete stranger calls and tells you he's a police officer, then you'd probably do whatever you were told to do, right? Even if this cop was pushing you to commit sexual assault, rape, etc.? I can't remember being more frustrated by poor decisions made by movie characters since I revisited the Friday the 13th franchise last summer, yet, Compliance's characters are purportedly based on real people who made real life stupid/criminal decisions. How could these people be so bloody stupid, you ask? After watching Life of Pi, you should have the answer you were looking for. It might also explain why so many of us bought the 'They hate us for our freedom' line.",5,1,14,7 March 2013
21," 21 Going on 11
","If I was eleven years old, there's a good chance I would have loved Robert Luketic's 21. But, unfortunately for the last 123 minutes of my life, the eleven year old kid is all grown up. Watching this movie I got the feeling it was Australian director Luketic's first film, but after fact checking I was a little shocked to see it was his fourth. Based on 21's steady parade of 'seen it all before' it's obvious he hasn't learned much in his four trips to the helm, unless of course his intent is to recycle every film-making cliché available. It's not that 21 was painful to watch, it actually is entertaining, but it begs one very real question: does Luketic have an original idea in his head?Things start off with the introduction of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), whom everyone refers to as 'the smartest guy they know.' Ben, despite being the smartest guy everyone knows, is stumped at how to come up with the 300 grand he needs to attend Harvard med school. Ben's hail mary is the Robinson scholarship, although the one thing keeping him from qualifying is a lack of real life experience -- can you guess where Ben finds it? I'll give you a hint: there's about 110 minutes of movie left.The problem with this setup is, while it does a great job providing us with a (requisite) dilemma, it spoils the (requisite) 3rd act twists. I guess the screenwriters felt sacrificing surprise was a small price to pay to establish Ben's motivation for getting involved with Prof. Micky Rosa's (Kevin Spacey) ragtag band of genius card counters. Either that, or they assumed the audience would completely and conveniently forget about the scholarship.While most young filmmakers worth their salt reference Welles, Godard, Fuller, Scorsese and other screen giants in their films, Luketic establishes very early into 21 his major influences are the makers of cookie cutter 1980's teen dramas. Case in point: the entrance of Ben's love interest Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). As we cut to the POV of Ben and his friends, we cut to an over-cranked, slow-motion shot of Taylor striding across the gym floor. The shot wouldn't be complete without the hit-you-over-the-head musical cue, and Luketic does not disappoint. The only thing missing was a wind machine tussling her golden locks. This shot is so cliché that even spoofs of it have become cliché. Perhaps Luketic missed the memo that this shot was officially retired after Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Remember the shot of Phoebe Cates, bikini clad and dripping wet, rising out of the swimming pool with nothing but the Cars 'Moving in Stereo' blasting across the soundtrack? Even Phoebe was smart enough to know her career had plateaued, prompting her to disappear into retirement/motherhood not long after. On another tangent, let me ask you this: if not one hockey player in the NHL has the arrogance (or ignorance) to don the number 99, what possesses Luketic to think he has the right to regurgitate this tired cliché of a shot?Throughout the movie, Luketic pulls out all the stops: voice over narration, flashbacks, montage sequences, time lapses, match dissolves, pop zooms, etc. His film-making is very democratic in the sense he refuses to leave anyone confused about what is going on. In other words, this is idiot proof film-making -- every idiot will be able to follow what's going on. The result: every nuance, every gesture, every raised eyebrow, every nod is shot in super slow motion and smash cut to an accompanying extreme close up. Luketic simply refuses to let subtlety get in the way of slapping the viewer across the face with what is going on. Even the product placement in 21 is shameless and overt, as evidenced in the bar scene when Ben orders 'two BUD LIGHTS' and then nails his mark as he perfectly positions the bottle's labels within the camera's line of sight. I feel sorry for the actors in the film since every reaction demanded of them is telegraphed with utter disdain for realism. Watching 21 I could imagine Luketic redirecting his actors: 'can you do it again, but make it bigger this time.' I'm at a loss to explain why Spacey would even sign on to play a character that is practically a parody of his previous work. I found it really hard not to snicker as he dispensed rat-tat-tat, yoda-like pez of wisdom.There's no question 21 is a paint by numbers affair, yet despite being formulaic and predictable, it somehow manages to be entertaining enough to not walk out of. The source material is definitely fascinating and the eye candy is worthy of most hip-hop music videos, but unless you are eleven years old, you can't excuse 21 for its bluntness. I mean really, are MIT geniuses really so stupid to think the same set of deliberate hand signals are never going to get detected? And if you do manage to stay through to the end, you will be witness to one of the most poorly directed chase scenes ever committed to celluloid.21 ends with a very literal soundtrack cue that is as on-the-nose as the Rolling Stones' track is infamous for being overused: you can't always get what you want. No sir, you sure can't.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",6,0,0,13 May 2008
Wanted," Ridiculous...and good.
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.comI detested the trailers and I'm not a fan of gene-pool lottery winner Angelina Jolie, so one movie I never thought I'd sit down to watch was Timur Bekmambetov's action orgy Wanted. Problem was, I kept coming across reviews that wrote about this film being a pleasant surprise. Considering all I had to lose was an hour and a half, I thought I'd give it a shot. Surprise, surprise...Wanted actually is a pleasant surprise.This surprise didn't come easy and it most definitely didn't come early. The first fifteen minutes or so was nothing less than a flip imitation of Fight Club, so lame that my finger hovered over the 'stop' button on my computer. But patience prevailed and once Wesley Gibson's (James McAvoy) fate was altered, there truly was no turning back. When Wanted shifts into second gear, it does so with a resounding thump of unbridled torque. Once Wanted screams aloud that its a thrill ride, it does something few action films ever have the smarts to do - it winks at the audience.This wink let's us know this isn't the real world, but that this is a movie...and a very silly movie at that. The remainder of Wanted is crammed full of implausibly over-the-top, yet very slick and expertly choreographed action sequences, each one upping the ante of ridiculousness. Wanted reminds us being silly and ridiculous is not the exclusive realm of the Farrelly Brothers, and not since John Woo made an art form out of corny, over-the-top action films has there been something with so much adrenaline and laugh-out-loud silliness as Wanted.Within this realm of excessive camp, Angelina Jolie fits as snug as silk stockings (not that I would actually know). The more serious she plays her character Fox (even the name is a groan inducing pun), the more you can't hate her freakishly abnormal 'good' looks and constant mugging for the camera. If she does take herself this seriously in real life, then she must be excruciating company, but if she has the sense of humor to understand her role here, then props to her. Her cheesy performance is destined to be parodied, yet few parodies will ever come close to besting her own efforts. She delivers every line of dialogue as if it were her last and every cat-like motion she slinks across the screen with is deliberately bon3r baiting.Beyond Jolie, the cast in Wanted is first rate. McAvoy does the fish-out-of-water routine with ease and Morgan Freeman is, well...Morgan Freeman. The pleasant bonus appearance is Terence Stamp who is, in my mind, one of the most underused actors around. I can't believe I'm saying it, but I had a laugh out loud riot watching Wanted. Never having met John Woo or Timur Bekmambetov, I can't say for sure if they take this junk seriously, but if taking the pi$$ out of a tired genre is their thing, then they're experts at this craft. If, on the other hand, they're not in on the joke...well, at least they're getting rich getting laughed at.",7,11,23,3 January 2009
Warrior," Old Genre / New Life
","www.eattheblinds.comThe sports genre has become as much of a cliché as the many clichés it has spawned: Rocky's Theme, Eye of the Tiger, etc. At this stage of the game, breathing new life into this old genre and sucking in an audience while surprising them along the way, is next to a near impossible feat. Somehow, writer/director Gavin O'Connor has pulled it off with the MMA masterpiece Warrior. Despite its complete checklist of boxing film / sports movie clichés, Warrior reaches so far beyond these clichés it practically redefines them. While respectful to reference (the original) Rocky, O'Connor legitimizes Warrior as a serious film, crafting it with visual and thematic nods to Michael Cimino's grand epic The Deer Hunter. Simply put, this isn't a sports film for meatheads (not that it won't please them), this is a sports film for audiences hungry for stark cinematic realism.Burgeoning superstar Tom Hardy (once again) mesmerizes as the tortured lead Tommy Conlon, who -- along with Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton -- make up a three headed beast with lethal acting chops. For a film I expected to detest, Warrior proved itself to be as big of an underdog champion as the unorthodox heroes it portrays.",9,4,7,7 March 2013
Tropic Thunder," Apocalypse Not
","Two days ago I plunked down $24 to take my girlfriend to see Tropic Thunder and, while it didn't disappoint, it did fall victim to the same shortcoming most comedies suffer: turning a high concept into a laugh sustaining 90 minute movie.TT starts out with three eye- wateringly funny mock trailers that introduce us to the stars of the fictional Vietnam war movie 'Tropic Thunder:' Tugg Speedman (Stiller) a brainless and vain action film star, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) a drug addicted fat pig of a fart famed comic and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) an Academy Award adorned Aussie method actor. When the film's director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) has his production threatened by ape-like studio magnate Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), Coogan takes the advice of 'Nam Vet Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) to throw his sissy actors into 'the sh##' in order to make the grittiest, most realistic war movie EVER.As you'd expect, things don't play out so well for Cockburn and as the three actors' misadventure devolves into a serious FUGAZI, we get a solid 40 minutes of gut crunching laughs. But then TT runs out of steam, it's clever concept and it's actors foibles paraded to the point of comedic fatigue and, aside from a remaining handful of insultingly un-PC jabs, the laughs devolve into a declining pattern of chuckles.Regardless of TT's inability to keep the laughs cranked up from beginning to end, Robert Downey Jr flexes chiseled comedic chops that harken back to his priceless supporting work as Wayne Gale in Natural Born Killers. While TT may be the best comedy of the summer, it is far from being one of the best comedies ever, yet in a movie-going comedy desert, TT is a tantalizing mirage worth seeing for RDJ's work alone. It should also be noted Stiller and fellow screenwriter Justin Theroux spent 10 years writing TT and, in true Stiller fashion, they take the pi## out of everything Hollywood deserves to be hated for and never stop to consider how hard they bite the same hands they've been eating out of for years. I might not love TT, but I definitely enjoyed it and have no problem advising friends to do like the TT tagline says: Get Some.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",7,1,8,13 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," Casino Royale v1.5
","Casino Royale was perhaps the best Bond film in the long running franchise; in short, it was grittier, more realistic and more human than any of its predecessors. By comparison, Quantum of Solace feels like a holding pattern. The latest Bond is a forgettable mix of passé locations, unmemorable (and impossibly blurred/overcut) action sequences, homogenized bad guys and a drowsy Daniel Craig. For no good reason, many of 007's signature traits are either toned down or completely missing from QoS: little charm, less glitz and few gadgets. Even more mysterious, is why QoS's chop licking theatrical trailer boasts a handful of shots noticeably absent from the finished product. On the poster of QoS, Bond -- with the seriously badass H&K UMP9 hoisted in the air -- advertises menace, but this proves to be false advertising. Not only is the movie devoid of any true menace, QoS doesn't even bother to put an UMP9 in Bond's hands. WTF? The talk that Director Marc Forster and screenwriter Paul Haggis are overrated A-listers is justified by QoS and if this limp incarnation of 007 does tepid box office business, Bond fans can only hope the duo are knocked back to their world of heavy-handed pseudo-indy melodramas and that the heavy lifting be left to those with foreign accents.",7,0,4,6 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," Top of the Coen's already impressive heap.
","So much more than a mere genre pic, the Coen Brother's No Country For Old Men is a masterpiece buoyed by sparse dialog, restrained performances, stark imagery and endless volumes of subtext.Without a doubt this is the Coen's most mature and accomplished film to date, an impressive feat considering how many great films are already behind them. What makes NCFOM so rewarding is the Coen's willingness to paint outside the lines, to throw convention on its ear and to remind audiences that the greatest movies always leave you with more questions than answers.After watching this film six times, I'm as captivated by it now as I was during the first viewing. Because NCFOM is so dense and so subtle, seeing it again has allowed me to pick up all the little pieces, confirming how tightly constructed, thought out and perfectly executed this film is. One particular scene, Llewelyn Moss' (Josh Brolin) death scene, caused a debate between a friend and myself. He felt cheated, arguing the Coen's had mistakenly left the footage of the actual killing on the cutting room floor. There was no doubt in my mind they never shot the scene for if they had it would have betrayed one of the principal themes woven into the story. I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name, but I know his work well enough to safely assume this ending fits into his fixation with unrelenting realism. In other words, in real life you don't always get the money shot since you never know when its going to come (no pun intended).In defense of my argument I cited the scene previous to Sheriff Bell's (Tommy Lee Jones) discovery of the freshly killed Moss. In this scene Moss' impending doom is foreshadowed when the girl at the pool asks him what he keeps looking out the window for. He answers 'lookin' for what's coming' and she shoots back 'but no one ever sees that.'The entire film is peppered with references to fate/destiny and the road that leads you there. Most telling is Anton Chigurh, brilliantly brought to life by Javier Bardem, who is obsessed with fate. When pitted against Moss' wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), Chigurh's frustration is stapled to his face when she refuses to let his coin decide if she should live or die. The very next scene, a surprise car crash that bludgeons Chigurh, is yet another reference to the universe blindsiding you at any moment's notice.Prior to Carla Jean's meeting with the Grim Reaper, Sheriff Bell tells her the bogus story about the guy who gets messed up by the dead steer: 'even in the contest between man and steer...the issue's not certain.' He then tells her about how air guns are now used to kill steer and they no longer know what hits 'em. The epilogue proves to be the final brush stroke, using Bell's dream to articulate the one and only absolute: that, one day, we'll all be dead.For once the Academy awarded the best film and best directing Oscars to the film and filmmakers most deserving. Time will tell, but I'm confident future generations will not debate this choice...in fact, I'm sure NCFOM will go down in history as one of the best films ever made. Now that it's on DVD, I look forward to many more viewings in the weeks, months and years to come.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",10,1,6,24 January 2008
Django Unchained," The Fine Art of Plagiarism
","www.eattheblinds.comThe last time I spent Xmas Day with Quentin Tarantino was in 1997. On that day, Jackie Brown and QT's shout outs to 70s Blaxploitation made my holidays worthy of celebration. From the good (White Dog), to the bad (Mean Johnny Barrows), to the flat out nasty (Maniac), B-movies have remained my greasy burger cure for Hollywood hangovers and nobody understands this craving better than Tarantino.Because of Death Proof, I marked 2007 as the end of Tarantino's short, but impressive career. Inglourious Basterds made me realize my prediction was a tad premature and last night's Xmas screening of Django Unchained had me swallowing my half-eaten words. In short, props are due: Quentin Tarantino -- the fast-food auteur -- is back on the map. What's also back is his talent for turning plagiarism into art and elevating the B-movie into art house splendor. Derivative yes, but this is a special talent no other rip-off artist has done as exceptionally well as QT. Tarantino doesn't merely copy, he cuts and pastes, and if plagiarism is art, Django Unchained is 2 hours and 46 minutes of glorious B-movie cinema spooning.While Django Unchained is a Runaway Slave flick bacon-wrapped with Spaghetti Western sauce and splattered with 'Argento Red' buckets of blood, it's also a monument of empowerment for a no-bullshit Hero who happens to be Black and proud. Despite refusing to watch DU, Spike Lee argues Tarantino is trivializing Slavery, an argument ignorantly reminiscent of the Catholic Church's attempt to smear Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ. The fact is, Tarantino's portrayal of slavery (and white supremacy) is contemptuous. Over and over, Tarantino exposes viewers to the viciousness, brutality, and ugliness of slavery and the racists responsible for it. He then ridicules these racists before he sends them all to hell at the hands of a true (Black) Hero.There really is only one thing to hate about this film and it comes in the form of a self- indulgent Director's cameo. Distracting beyond words, the scene is fortunately short lived and tactfully punctuated by Tarantino having himself blown to smithereens. Nitpicks aside, Django Unchained is steeped in so much of the 70s it looks, sounds and feels like golden age deja vu. With deserving cameos from Franco Nero (the original Django) and Bruce Dern, to the countless flashbacks recalling Peckinpah, George Roy Hill, Jeremiah Johnson, and volumes of others, Django Unchained is a cinematic standout in a digital age gone wrong. Do yourself a favor this holiday season and go see a brand-new Classic...on film (if you can).",8,2,6,7 March 2013
The Mist," Play Misty for Me
","The trailer did nothing to entice me, the concept seemed like a rehash of Carpenter's The Fog and the cast was a big fat 'who gives a shi#.' The Mist wasn't a film I had high hopes for, especially since hatchet man Stephen King wrote it (the same King who hated Kubrick's Shining) and one hit wonder Frank Shawshank Darabont was manning the helm. It did however star Thomas Jane who had my eye after great roles in Boogie Nights and The Thin Red Line; but this was also the same TJ who lost my attention after a spectacular string of worthless films. On top of all that, it had Marcia Gay Harden in it and the prospect of staring at her mope face wasn't working to The Mist's advantage.Five minutes into it, I knew I wasn't watching The Fog. As two hours whisked by, The Mist cheated me out of the perfect ending but it had earned my respect. Despite laughably bad CGI, a few dead spots killed by on-the-nose dialogue and characters a little too quick to propel the plot in a dire direction, The Mist delivered where most cookie cutter horror films don't. It wasn't completely predictable, it wasn't utterly mindless and it understood the two basic tenets of all good horror: mood and atmosphere. I haven't read the SK novella so I can't comment on whether the screenplay took its own liberties or not, but a lot of what was happening and being said provided the audience with a sub textual narrative critiquing religious fanaticism and fear mongering. The present day neo-con landscape is one where both fear and religion play pivotal roles in our daily lives and Darabont pulls no punches showing how these two societal cancers can and will lead us down a path of self destruction.The writing isn't brilliant social commentary and at times it suffers from being a bit too obvious. Nevertheless Darabont manages to get across a timely and relevant message without betraying the story and because he's able to pull off this delicate act, he elevates The Mist above the crowd of mindless horror clones dropping into theaters every few weeks. He also has to be commended for the brilliant casting of Gay Harden as a typical fundamentalist nut bag that you would personally love to shut up with a hollow point kiss. Fortunately for us, someone does in the most splendid of ways.Lastly, The Mist almost ends perfectly, yet instead opts for a denouement that is tragic, ironic and, ultimately, predictable. Something tells me this ending was penned by SK who probably patted himself on the back for having the ability to write something ironic.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",7,0,1,1 May 2008
The Dark Knight," You Complete Me...
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/The hype is right. The Dark Knight is the greatest super hero movie ever made. Some might even go so far as to say it's the best movie ever made, but don't put me in that faction. Sadly, saying this is the best super hero movie ever isn't really saying much considering it really only had itself (aka Batman Begins) to outdo. It goes without saying the super hero genre has been notoriously weak, with exceptions being: Richard Lester's Superman II, Richard Donner's Superman, Tim Burton's Batman & Batman Returns and Jon Favreau's Iron Man. TDK is epic. It runs for 152 minutes and there really is little or no fat in those two and a half hours. Director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonah shared screen writing duties and they have to be given tremendous credit for capturing the dark and distinct tone of graphic novels, in addition to penning subtextual elements critiquing certain moral and ethical hot button political issues. The plot is deep, dark and shares more in common with The Godfather than anything else in the super hero genre. In other words, this is much more than a mere comic book action movie.In fact, Nolan should be given credit for reinventing the genre, by taking it out of the realm of mere spectacle and for making its themes, story and characters the centerpiece. Whereas most comic book movies before TDK could be considered kids movies, TDK is unquestionably one for adults. Nolan's reinvention began with Batman Begins when he immersed Batman, Bruce Wayne and Gotham in the real world and with TDK Nolan ratchets up the realism by making a film that's as dramatically engaging as it is visceral. A fair amount of press has been given to Nolan's commitment to reproducing reality (via practical effects/stunts vs. CG) and there's no question the action feels palpable, but as impressive as the technical aspects behind TDK are, it is the writing that separates it from everything else in its genre.As impressive as the Nolan's writing and directing is, it's impossible to ignore the collective work of the ensemble cast. Not since Michael Cimino and his epic ensemble pieces has there been an A-list level of ensemble excellence associated with a true Hollywood blockbuster. While many big budget films assemble impressive rosters of Academy Award winning actors, they seldom demand little or no heavy lifting from their stars. TDK is, refreshingly, an exception to this current trend of throwaway performances.Without debate, Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker will cement the late actor's reputation, leaving admirers with little else to do but ponder what more this gifted actor could have accomplished. Ledger's disturbingly psychopathic Joker is an impressive counterpoint to his quiet and tortured performance in Brokeback Mountain proving Ledger not only possessed incredible range, but was easily the most talented (and interesting) actor of his generation. Yet, as exciting as Ledger is to watch as the Joker, this is Christian Bale's film and he turns in an equally impressive (yet far more subdued) performance as the psychologically complex and tortured anti-hero / industrialist Bruce Wayne. Bale literally seethes with contempt throughout TDK and if you've ever read Frank Miller's graphic novel Batman the Dark Knight Returns then it won't take much to envision a fifty-something Bale reprising the role of Batman down the road. With a little luck Nolan will be back at the helm.My plan is to return to the theater to see TDK again. I don't do this very often since few films warrant any reason to. The last time I did so was three separate screenings of Children of Men. COM is, in my mind, a contemporary masterpiece. Does TDK stand up to COM? Is it better?",9,1,5,13 September 2008
The World's Fastest Indian," I couldn't hate this movie even if I tried...and I tried
","I'm a sucker for sports movies that pit an underdog against impossible circumstances. I cry like a little boy every time I watch Field of Dreams, I'm inspired every time Rocky beats Apollo Creed, and so on. The funny thing is, none of these movies are in my film library which boasts over 500 titles. This realization dawned on me after I finished watching 2005's The World's Fastest Indian, a flawed but inspiring telling of the incredible true story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins).Munro was a 68 year old New Zealander who ventured by sea to the USA with the goal of setting a land speed record on his antique Indian motorcycle. Many of the clichÃ©s characteristic of underdog stories are in place (too old, too poor, too many odds stacked against, etc.), yet despite the all-too-familiar aspects present in WFI, it works exceptionally well. While WFI might be open to criticism for not setting Munro up against more dire obstacles on his journey, the obstacles present take on a less conventional role of being used to not only show the resilience of the human spirit, but also how charitable our fellow men/women are towards people who dare to dream big. Munro was an inspiring man and what makes his story worth telling isn't just what he does to inspire, it's what others do for him as a result of being inspired by Munro.Without being overly sentimental, WFI celebrates ingenuity, determination and most of all, human compassion towards one's neighbor. What exactly it was about WFI that hadn't inspired me to see it before remains a question as unanswerable as why I don't have any other inspiring underdog stories in my movie library. Perhaps I'm a little embarrassed to admit I'm a sucker for less than perfect films that make me cry like a little boy. Waaaaaaah!",8,0,0,6 December 2008
Departures," Departures: It's All In The Details
","2008's Academy Award Winner for Best Foreign Language Film didn't exactly come out of nowhere, but it was certainly the underdog in a race against Israel's Waltz With Bashir and France's Entre Les Murs. All three are worth seeing, but what makes Departures especially interesting is Director Yojiro Takita's filmography. Considering the last Japanese AA Winner was Akira Kurosawa (for a Russian-made film), Takita is in elite company, especially for a filmmaker who cut his teeth making Pinku films. Pinku (Pinku Eiga) is essentially softcore pornography, but like most things in Japanese Cinema, it's nothing like its American counterpart. Personally, I'm not a fan of Porn...but I am a fan of Pinku. The differences are myriad, but the fact a Pinku director would go on to helm a film as thought provoking, touching and poignant as Departures, comes as no surprise (even if it does suffer from unimpressive cinematography and a few corny moments). As much of a long shot as Departures was to win, the odds of an American porn Director making such a profound ascension to cinema's pantheon may be too staggering to even compute. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",8,1,3,9 December 2010
The Wrestler," The Return of the King
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is probably the best American film of 2008 and in it, Mickey Rourke delivers perhaps the best performance of 2008. Significantly, The Wrestler announces two important things: 1) Aronofsky has put behind him his film student fixation with gimmicky camera and editing techniques in favor of honest, straight forward film-making and 2) Mickey Rourke is back from the dead.In case you forgot (or are too young to remember), Rourke was once Hollywood's golden boy, a pretty face with more talent than any of his peers. At the time, the comparisons to Brando were inevitable, but they were also justified - Rourke was an exceptional talent. Just like Brando, Rourke's demons got the worse of him and the drugs, drink, and inexplicable detour into prize fighting, devastated both the man and his once promising career.In The Wrestler, Rourke plays Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a character so achingly human, you can't resist caring for, crying for and cheering for him. Credit this empathy to Rourke who invests everything in his portrayal of Ram. There's little doubt why Aronofsky cast Rourke as Ram - simply put, Rourke is Ram. And just like Ram, Rourke isn't capable of mailing in a performance; Ram sacrifices everything for his adoring fan, just as Rourke is willing to put everything on table to make The Ram real. When Ram tearfully acknowledges to his estranged daughter (Rachel Evan Wood) he screwed up, he hurt people, he hurt himself and that he regrets the price he's paid for his mistakes, it is obvious Rourke is plumbing the depths of his own despair.Rourke's ravaged face is a testament to how badly this man has had the sh## kicked out of him in both the boxing ring and in life. This face isn't the creation of a prosthetics or make- up artist, this is the face of a man with a past, with pain and, tragically, with very few people left to love him. This too is The Ram and this verisimilitude is precisely why The Wrestler is destined to be an American classic. It is a surprisingly tender, unpredictable and heart-felt emotional ride about a fallen idol from the 1980s, starring a fallen idol from the 1980s. With luck, this personal piece of work will be as cathartic to Rourke as it is for his fans. If so, welcome back Mickey...you've been missed.",9,2,4,13 January 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Falls...
","www.eattheblinds.comI'm torn. I keep trying to convince myself The Dark Knight Rises was more than just another mediocre summer blockbuster rife with conservative ideals, but that is was actually subversive art depicting a pathetic world condemned to suckle a poisonous teat. Perhaps my False Dilemma is over-simplistic, but isn't the entire plot of TDKR based on a False Dilemma? That the only alternative to a corrupt system is one that's much, much worse? Identical to the American political system, must we be forced to choose between the lesser of two evils? Does Writer/Director Christopher Nolan deserve props for editorializing (the arguably two- faced) Obama's 'Hope' and 'Change' is as bankrupt as 'I Believe in Harvey Dent'? After restlessly squirming through three hours of TDKR, I'm having a hard time convincing myself TDKR was Nolan's 'Fuck Off' to a bankrupt system. I want to give TDKR the benefit of the doubt by believing it was a cynic's portrayal of a hopeless world populated with idiots / necessarily controlled by the wicked and corrupt since this is our world, after all, and we probably don't deserve any better. But without reading too much into TDKR, we bear witness to a world in ruin, one that somehow remains worth fighting for, is in need of the same leaders who led us to the brink, but are the only ones truly capable of putting it back together again. To be the former, the TDKR has to be so exceptionally subtle, its meaning would most likely be lost. If so, this is a film -- arguably -- more bleak than Se7en, so dark and cynical it's careful to not tip its hat to the unsuspecting fools it also hopes to profit off of at the box office. The problem is, TDKR is too carefully constructed, and too perfectly crafted to be anything other than the blockbuster it was destined to be. Regardless, I still want to believe Nolan has pulled the wool over everyone's eyes, and that he truly is mercilessly misanthropic.Unfortunately what was supposed to be the grand finale of Nolan's series instead comes off as a cliché-ridden setup for a spin-off series the Hollywood machine will inevitably bleed to death. On the record as being finished with the franchise, Nolan certainly had every reason to reduce to rubble what he'd once resurrected. 'If I can't have her, then no one will.' While the cheesy one-liners peppered through The Dark Knight winked a reminder we were watching a comic book-based movie, they take precedence in TDKR, cementing the reality this franchise has jumped the shark. Catwoman's groan-inducing, and wholly unmotivated climactic kiss is a sucker punch on the nose that tells us the writers aren't interested in reinventing conventions anymore, they're now painting them by numbers. The biggest cheap-out is the gimmicky M. Night-like plot twist that completely undermines the villain Bain, a seemingly immovable force of evil we'd been tricked into believing was so exceptional, he may never be defeated. But the pointless shell game played with villains reduces the once frightening Bain into a castrated, then limply disposed of freak, all in favor of a 'eureka' moment of revelation where the true villain is (shocker) Bruce Wayne's love interest. But Nolan's faith in justice ensures the femme fatale meets her demise in one the most satire-worthy death shrugs ever committed to film.The plot of TDKR centers on how the people of Gotham were duped into believing a big fat lie, a joke not lost on me knowing I was duped into paying $13.50 to see it. Keeping with the theme of art imitating life, TDKR stands tall as a painful reminder I had shed tears of joy in 2008 for a fraud of a similar kind. The Nolan brother's manage to both pander to the trendiness of the Occupy Movement, and dismissively throw it under the bus. In this story where our 'Hero' ends up rising to the cause of the Corrupt, the Occupy Movement is painted with one bold brush stroke, as brutal fascists, far worse than the 1% who had 'heroically' sacrificed their ethics to keep peace in a world lacking civility. In TDKR, Batman no longer masquerades as a conflicted hero, he evolves into a full-blown sell-out, both as a vigilante, and -- in the real world -- as a movie franchise. The tacked on ending oh-so-cleverly ties all of our protagonists into one happy fun ball of bullshit. He's alive! Oh thank God we can now continue to worship our resurrected deity by emptying our wallets again, and again. Repent Sinner, for you're too stupid to deserve any better than the fate they've chosen for you.",5,6,12,7 March 2013
Iron Man," I Am (Almost) Iron Man
","At just over two hours, Iron Man packs in a lot of story, a lot of gadgetry, a lot of special effects and a lot of everything every other superhero movie throws at you to get your $12. But was it worth every penny? Yes and no.As I mentioned in my last Iron Man post, IM was one of my two favorite comic books when I was a kid. I actually own IM #2, although its probably worthless since its nearly in tatters. What I liked about IM was it was somewhat grounded in reality. In other words, Tony Stark was a real guy elevated to being a badass only because he was capable of building a badass suit. The other thing I liked about Stark were his flaws...and he had a lot of them.I went into the theater today with very high expectations. The trailers gave me glimpses of everything I liked about the comic book and perhaps even a lot more. But having ridiculously high expectations, it is pretty hard to ever be blown away. The truth is, I never felt blown away by IM and the reason I wasn't was simply because it was too much like every other comic book hero movie I've ever seen and I wanted it to be more.There is no question the gadgetry and techo porn in this movie was on hyperdrive and every time Stark was engineering his wares, I was there with him, wanting to be him, wanting to play with his toys (please don't read into that). Everything about Stark exudes cool: the gadgets, the clothes, the women, the cars, the house and yes, the attitude. This movie will do very well at the box office simply because it is wish fulfillment for every single guy with a hard drive and a hard on, which is damn near every heterosexual male in America (if not the world).But where this movie let me down is an area that might make me the worst person to have a fair opinion on this movie: I wanted it to do something completely different, I wanted it to redefine the genre. While it definitely ups the ante in terms of gadgetry, tech and special FX, it follows the same story arc that every other super hero movies follows: man undergoes metamorphosis, man reinvents himself, man sets out to right the world's wrongs, man is confronted by other man or entity who represents every thing that is wrong with the world, man battles foe in herculean climax scene, movie ends. Sure IM quite possibly is the mastery of this formula, but it didn't leave me feeling satisfied.As for the performances in the film, Robert Downey Jr is perfect. Knowing his personal past, we can see the parallel he shares with Tony Stark, trading in a life of excess for a rebirth into a stronger, more moral and more important person. Jeff Bridges oozes evil right down to the way he slurps at his scotch. Terrence Howard on the other hand is wall paper, barely noticeable and utterly bland. Gwyneth Paltrow convinced me of one thing: she is not a strong actor. Director Jon Favreau does a great job emulating the IM comic book world, packing this film full of thrills, eye candy and laughs. What I found most effective about this world is that it seems entirely plausible. Who knows, with the continuing advancements in tech, perhaps one day an engineer will build a real world Iron Man suit and when it rears its head in this ugly world, then and only then will there be an IM story worthy of my high expectations.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",8,0,5,2 May 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Deja Vu All Over Again.
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/You can't call Woody Allen's latest film crap. The truth is, if his name wasn't attached to it, it would pass as a serviceable piece of estrogen pandering movie-making, yet even without his name, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is plagued by the all-too visible Woody Allen watermark. At this twilight stage in Allen's career he seems hellbent on proving Renoir's rumination individual filmmakers are doomed to make the same film over and over again. The problem with this pattern of redoing everything he's done before, Allen is dangerously close to tarnishing his reputation and is well past the point of evidencing he's merely a mortal. It hurts to realize that this American icon is not a genius...he's just a guy who found his little niche and was savvy enough to perfect it. But Woody perfected this art nearly twenty years ago and in the twenty years since, he's done nothing but turn his art into an archetype.As longtime Allen watchers have come to expect, the actors may change, but the characters and the non-stop dialogue remains exactly the same. Perhaps there's comfort in this familiarity, which would explain why critics and his adoring followers are so reluctant to call Allen out for this sham. How many times can one stomach the same neuroses, the same speech patterns and rhythms, the same interchangeable references to classical music/literature/cinema and the same setup and delivery of jokes? Worst of all, the plots have been recycled so many times that they've become transparently predictable. Unless you're not acquainted with Allen's formula, seconds after polar opposites Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) meet the charming Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), you know exactly how ironically the events will play out. He may not be the genius we all once thought he was, but Woody is still a very smart guy, begging the question: isn't he aware of the pointlessness of remaking the same film ad nauseam? Isn't it embarrassing for him to reveal how incredibly limited his palate is? Isn't it humiliating to show he's got nothing left to offer? Does he even care?Yet despite the well worn formula, VCB still manages to be a watchable movie with a handful of great (albeith isolated) moments. Bardem and Penelope Cruz prove to be the scene stealers, perhaps taking liberty with their native tongue and adding a truly foreign (and fresh) dimension to the carefully regurgitated screenplay. Their chemistry proves to be as convincing as it is compelling and without these two, VCB would have been lost in expanding bog of forgettable films Woody has dutifully churned out on cue over the last few decades.",5,2,6,3 January 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Why Such Praise?
","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/One movie that won't be on my year-end best of 2008 list is Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. What's surprising to me is that I might be the only critic on the web to not have it on their list. After watching it last night, I want to know: why all the love for a routine melodrama dressed up as something exotic?As you expect from Boyle, SM is exceptionally stylish, fluid and kinetic. The more I think about why so many people love this movie, the more I come back to how expertly the film is crafted. It is a hyper film, bristling with action, drama, emotion and energy. India makes for a truly epic backdrop, with splashes of color, clutter and exotic wonder. With the languages breaking in and out of English, Hindi and other regional dialects, SM feels like a completely foreign, yet utterly accessible movie. In nearly ever superficial way imaginable, SM strives to be a palatable form of culture shock. Based on its success, it seems Boyle has succeeded.For the first half of the film, the story's winding structure deliberately keeps you guessing, your head spinning amidst a whirlwind of backstory and puzzling present tense. But by about the halfway mark, I found my bearings, and once I did, the artifice of the film started to reveal itself. At this point, a very simple, but (potentially) revealing question popped into my head: if this whole thing was set in the USA with familiar actors and locations, wouldn't it just be another syrupy sweet romantic melodrama?Perhaps the real culprit was when the story and character's transitioned from childhood to maturity. With the first half of SM reminiscent of the adventures of Satyajit Ray's Apu, I was swept up and completely sucked in by young Jamal's struggles. But once Jamal was transformed into a young man, the events unraveled into a predictable teenage soap opera, with plot lines seemingly plucked from The O.C. or Gossip Girl.By the time the end credits started to roll and the cast of actors broke into a choreographed song and dance routine, I felt like Boyle was mocking me. For a movie that starts out with such a kick to the gut in terms of gritty, gutter level realism, for it to end on such a completely phony level, I can't help but feel Boyle pulled the wool over everyone's eyes. Perhaps that's the point.It's no secret SM is a fairy tale, furthermore, much of it is lifted right out of the pages of Dickins' Oliver Twist. The film also references Puccini's Tosca, a three-act opera considered by many to be the most dramatic of all operas. Since Boyle unabashedly acknowledges SM's operatic and dramatic origins, then perhaps his fault is his ambition. His ambition is to turn a contrived melodrama into a social commentary, to thrust into the spotlight the issues of poverty, a developing India, the caste system, globalization and the injustices of capitalism. Big themes indeed, but Boyle is not Brecht and there's nothing post-modern about SM's shamefully manipulative attempt to hide behind realism. I might be the only critic on the web to dislike this movie...but at least I know why.",6,6,13,3 January 2009
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The (Not Quite) Last Crusade
","Tonight I wrapped up revisiting the Indy franchise with The Last Crusade. The five or so years between Temple of Doom and this installment gave Spielberg and Co. time to go back to basics, recast a few hundred Nazis, cart out another religious relic, reinforce some more Christian mythology and throw in a dose of Sean Connery for good measure. Benefiting TLC, the camp, corn and annoying female sidekick from TOD are long gone as is a supporting cast of way too many cute little kids that served an almost Ewok-like presence.The only kids in TLC are in the prologue which flashes back to the young Indy played by the late River Phoenix. The prologue's back story manages to cram in the origins of many (if not all) of Indy's trademarks: the hat, the whip, the fear of snakes and his overall look and demeanor. Phoenix convincingly apes Harrison Ford's signature Indy-isms and also manages to look like the kid Harrison probably was. True to the franchise, Spielberg rolls out a series of tributes, one of the best being the prologue's train sequence which feels like frames lifted right out from Buster Keaton's 1927 classic The General.What makes TLC a cut above TOD are the numerous real world locations, the pseudo- historical references and stunts grounded in real-world physics. Connery who is cast as Indy's dad, is a worthy addition to a strong cast and the constant adversarial banter between him and Ford doesn't get tired like the nagging supplied ad nausea by Kate Capshaw in TOD.While it can be argued TLC cannibalizes Raiders for success, I can't find a reason to argue with the old adage: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Like Raiders, TLC is truly an adventure, an homage to classic Hollywood serials that manages to elevate the genre well beyond that of any of its predecessors. I've maintained for years that Spielberg is a master story teller, but that his talents run threadbare when he steps out of his comfort zone. TLC is definitely in his comfort zone and after watching it tonight, I'm even more hopeful that The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will be a worthy addition to an already fantastic saga.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",7,3,6,1 May 2008
