Vertigo," Stuff dreams are made on... and nightmares
","'Vertigo' is generally considered as the finest movie of one of the greatest directors, ahead of other masterpieces such as 'Rear Window', 'North by Northwest', 'Notorious', 'Rebecca', etc. In the Sight & Sound poll 2012 (a reference worldwide survey issued every ten years), it is rated best film ever in front of 'Citizen Kane'. It has progressed consistently in the poll: not listed (1962), #12 (1972), #7 (1982), #4 (1992), #2 (2002). In itself this survey does not constitute an absolute value, however it provides a notion of the high esteem of many directors and professionals.The movie is based on a novel, 'D'Entre les Morts' (The Living and the Dead) by Boileau & Narcejac written a few years earlier (1954). However the book just provides a simple frame: the film gives it an altogether superior dimension. Its technical qualities have frequently been analysed: I will summarise some. What is more interesting is the fascination it exerts on many viewers, probably linked to its dreamlike essence (more below).*** WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS ***First, the objective qualities. They override the seeming flaws, which turn off some viewers and might explain the fact the movie was a critical and commercial failure when it came out: the plot is hardly credible, Gavin's ploy is far-fetched, there are long silent sequences, Kim Novak is not entirely convincing as Hitchcock himself noted (although he was maybe trying to partly blame her for the failure). However all this is secondary compared to outstanding direction, image, music and themes. Hitchcock did not aim for a simple thriller since he gives away the ploy much before the end: his ambition was far greater.The movie plays on the concepts of repetition and duality, illustrating the mystery of Madeleine/Carlotta, the double life of Madeleine/Judy and the dual structure (the fist part until Madeleine's death lasts 1h15, the second part 55'). We go to the same places before and after Madeleine dies: Ernie's restaurant, the flower shop, Dolores mission cemetery (the second time in Scottie's dream), the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Scottie's place, San Juan Bautista mission and its tower (with the same shots on the trees along the road, the second time darker).Madeleine is sometimes reflected in mirrors and windows, notably the first time she appears at Ernie's. There are two paintings of Carlotta: the real one and the fake one Midge paints (a 'double duality' since Midge represents herself as Carlotta). There are two hotels (McKittrick and Empire). Scottie falls in his dream as the policeman did in the first scene. 'Don't be so motherly', Scottie tells Midge; later on when he is in the hospital she says 'Mother is here'. Note we do not see Midge afterwards, as though she were discarded by Scottie's obsessive search for Madeleine.Visually, this repetition is illustrated by the image of the circle: the eyes and shapes of the opening credits, the cross-section of the tree at Redwoods State Park, Madeleine's and Carlotta's hairdo, the flowers. A notable exception: the staircase of the mission's tower is square. This is not because Hitchcock composed with what was available (since the mission has no such tower): the tower is where events tragically come to an end; the square breaks the iteration of the circle.All this already composes a major picture; moreover, its fine blend of reality and hallucination generate a unique magnetism. 'Life is a dream' (CalderÃ³n): no movie expresses this better than 'Vertigo'.1. There are obvious references: Madeleine tells about her nightmare and we see Scottie's.2. Many scenes feel dreamlike or, sometimes, nightmarish. Notably the two scenes in the tower and the trial (surprisingly situated on the spot of the accident), where the judge lambasts Scottie, completely overstepping his role: a typical nightmare situation where one is criticised without being able to answer. Ernie's is an unreal place with its red walls and its still atmosphere. When Scottie kisses Judy, the room turns around and we see the mission as in a daydream.3. Many scenes occur in San Francisco region landmarks (the above-mentioned, Golden Gate bridge, Cypress Point, Palace of fine Arts), yet we see few people: it is as if Scottie dreamt these events in remarkable places and only focused on Madeleine and himself. Also, when Scottie follows Madeleine, many parts are silent as dreams frequently are.4. There are strange lightings as if reality were altered: when we first see Madeleine, the light become unusually bright; it gets surprisingly dark in the bookstore; the cemetery scene is hazy; when Judy 'reincarnates' as Madeleine, she is surrounded by a green halo, looking like a ghost. Colours are voluntarily saturated. Another alteration of reality happens when Scottie thinks he sees Madeleine at Ernie's after she died: it actually is Kim Novak but she is replaced by another actress as she comes closer.5. Herrmann's haunting music is almost hypnotic.Hence it feels as though we were in Scottie's brain. We follow him throughout the movie with a few exceptions. We frequently see what he sees: he watches Madeleine, he follows her, he dreams, he feels 'vertigo' (with a special camera effect). The film could be interpreted as Scottie's dream or subjective view partly deformed by emotion.'Vertigo' also is a metaphor about love. In the first part, Scottie falls in love with Madeleine while she is playing a role. Do we love persons for what they are or for what we think they are? In the second part, he transforms Judy to have her look like Madeleine. Do we love persons only if they meet our desires? Judy complies because Scottie's happiness is more important than hers. Should we do anything to satisfy the person we love? Yet both forms of love (illusion and possession) lead to destruction. These metaphors are collateral but they add to the substance of this incomparable movie.",10,7,9,9 March 2016
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Satirical and cunning farce: you either love it or hate it
","'God created man in His own image' (Genesis, 1:27). He gave him humour, and saw it was good. Later, God created cinema, and saw it was good. Still later, God created the Monty Python, but was not sure it was good. It got out of hand, because this disrespectful bunch used God's creations, man, humour and cinema, to turn them against religion.So the story goes: some believers think 'Life of Brian' is blasphemous. It was banned on its initial release by several UK councils, Ireland and Norway. However, non-believers think this aspect is trivial. Let's try to neutrally assess how provocative the movie is.In any case, the religious satire needs to be tempered by two caveats: the movie not only mocks religion, but almost everything MP can lay their hands upon; the blasphemous parts are not hostile nor gratuitous. Let's explore both elements. I won't discuss humour, because it is subjective (for me the movie is hilarious).1. What do MP target apart from religion?<ul><li>People. Except Brian, humans are stupid and/or ridiculous morons. Brian's mother is greedy, vulgar and simple-minded. Persons quarrel foolishly precisely when Jesus voices his Sermon on the Mount, a message of love. Even Brian's girlfriend, brainwashed by ideology, abandons Brian on the cross when he asks to be freed.</li></ul><ul><li>Crowds. If individually people are pathetic, when they gather, they also are ugly. Women cruelly regroup at the beginning to lapidate a poor lad whose crime is trifle. An insensitive mob plays with prisoners' lives by asking for irrelevant pardons to make fun of Pilate's pronunciation. Crowds blindly worship Brian: 'We've got to work it out for ourselves', they repeat like brainless zombies. The suicide squad, well, commits suicide without freeing Brian.</li></ul><ul><li>Oppressive power. Romans imprison, crucify and execute. Yet the powerful are laughable. The mighty Pilate and Biggus Dikus are grotesque. A Roman patrol, instead of arresting Brian for a graffiti, makes him copy a hundred times 'Romans go home' in Latin (a reference to the slogan 'US go home' during the Vietnam War, which ended four years before the movie was released).</li></ul><ul><li>Vain ideology that delivers no results (a possible reference to left-wing politics). To resist oppression, the rebel group displays an impressive incompetence. They spend more time fighting each other than against Romans (People's Front of Judea, Judean People's Front, Judean Popular People's Front). They just talk pompously and don't manage to perform one single effective action during the entire movie: only does Brian graffiti the fortress. The rebel leader is cynical, cowardly and short-sighted.</li></ul><ul><li>Themselves. Like a schoolboy bunch, MP make fun of everything including their own movie. Each of them plays different roles, some completely silly. Graham Chapman appears in frontal nudity, very rare in cinema at the time. They introduce an absurd and useless scene parodying Star Wars (WTF?), whereby a spaceship captures Brian (FWTF?) and crashes after a battle (FWTFF?).</li></ul>2. The movie iconoclastically tackles various religious fundamentals. MP argued their movie is heretical, not blasphemous, because it mocks dogma but not God: granted, even though the representation of Jesus is ambiguous (see below). Also, it sometimes feels as if it does not criticise religion as much as the usage people make of it, since they are dumb as noted above.<ul><li>The Nativity. The three Wise Men mistake Brian for Jesus, implying the Latter was a man like any other.</li></ul><ul><li>The Crucifixion. Brian ends on the cross like Jesus: the loop with the initial confusion is looped. Crucifixion, which was actually widespread, is not shown as horrible but as a relatively minor punishment. The final scene is not tragic but comical: the crucified sing 'Always look on the bright side of life', one of MP's best songs. Understandably, this sequence was highly controversial.</li></ul><ul><li>The Messiah. It is easy to become one like Brian: a few words, some mystery and crowds will follow senselessly. Faith, as love, is blind.</li></ul><ul><li>The Sayings. Jesus's Sermon is misunderstood ('Blessed are the cheese-makers', 'Blessed are the Greek'). Yet it is unclear who is being made fun of: people who miss the point, or Jesus who accumulates the 'Blessed are'. Jesus is surrounded by a halo, but this positive view could be first or second degree.</li></ul><ul><li>Relics. When Brian drops a gourd and a shoe, his followers absurdly split into two groups, each worshipping a different relic. And that is how sects are born...</li></ul><ul><li>Fear. Religion is based on fear (Hell, Judgement Day, the deadly sins, the ten commandments, crucifixion representations, prohibitions). In the movie, would-be prophets distil fear with dreadful predictions... until a lunatic turns this rhetoric upside-down ('A friend shall lose his friend's hammer'). Again it is not clear if the target is religion, or people who need to be frightened in order to orientate their deeds.</li></ul><ul><li>Wows. A hermit breaks his silence wow... because Brian stepped on his foot. Wows appear as a useless and easily reversible commitment.</li></ul>-----In summary, 'Life of Brian' is farcical yet meaningful, richer than its simple blasphemous reputation: it blends MP's unique style into a consistent and funny satire. Historically well documented, it arguably is the best of the three movies they directed, less gratuitous and nonsensical than 'Holy Grail' and 'The Meaning of Life'.Behind the farce, the movie delivers a hedonistic message: even if life is bleak, let's have fun. People are idiotic and cruel, but also laughable. Oppressive powers can be ridiculed. Humans are condemned, but show resilience by singing. Ideology can be a risible delusion. We don't know if religion is right or wrong, but it can be caricatured.You will not like this movie if you are hermetic to MP's humour or if your religious beliefs are hurt, both being understandable reactions. But then, isn't comedy always irreverent?",10,10,16,5 December 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Solid Episode 3.9: an extra brick in the SW edifice
","After all, it is not so complex to make a good action movie.DON'TS. No Jar-Jar Binks. No ridiculous Ewoks. No Muppet Show, as in Jabba's lair at the beginning of Episode 6. Don't cast the worst actor of the galaxy in the main role, as in Episodes 2 and 3. Don't uselessly plagiarise previous Episodes, as Episode 7. No gratuitous and/or inflated action. No awkward situations. No idiotic dialogues. No blabbering about the Force. No pseudo-Freudian heaviness about being one's father, about killing one's father, about finding one's path.DO'S. Keep it simple, at last. Build a solid plot without inconsistencies. Maintain pacing, alternating fast and slow scenes. Justify action scenes with coherent reasons. Edit effectively. Insert funny dialogues. Cast talented actors (Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, etc.). Use efficient special effects for a valid point. Show gorgeous landscapes. Pay attention to details (examples: the broken glass falling into the vault highlights how imposing the place is; when Darth Vador emerges from darkness with his lightsaber at the end, the effect is striking). Renew the soundtrack and only hint at standard SW themes instead of recycling them throughout (although this can feel underwhelming for real fans). Resurrect late actors with CGI (Peter Cushing, Carrie Fisher), even though the result is not entirely satisfying. Have a mixed ending, where the mission is fulfilled but at the cost of many casualties.Also, solve Episode 4 flaws. I have been wondering for almost 40 years: why the heck did the mighty Empire allow such a dangerous weakness in the powerful Death Star, which they built with great care? And how did the Rebels manage to get the secret plans? Now we know. 'Rogue One' convincingly links with Episode 4: it purposefully stages situations and characters of the latter; it probably ends a few minutes or hours before Darth Vador jumps into an Imperial spaceship to chase Princess Leia who just flew away (regarding this, it would have been even better to see R2-D2 in her ship, in order to fully reconcile with the beginning of Episode 4, when she gives the plans to the droid). Nonetheless, the movie is more than just a spin-off: it is a full-blown Episode per se, with a developed story, credible new characters and real qualities. References to Episode 4 are not invasive: there is a fair balance between connection to the saga and autonomy.WHAT IS MISSING? The movie is not very original, it feels rather formatted; but then is it possible to completely overhaul a franchise that already has 7 episodes? There is not much character depth; actually the most touching role is K-2SO and we almost feel sorry when he goes down. Apart from Chirrut's fighting skills, action scenes are standard. Some emotional scenes are a bit silly, although they are limited. This is why I can only rate the movie 7/10. Good, but not amazing.STILL 'Rogue One' is for me the best of the franchise to date. Here, I have to confess I am not a huge SW fan (sincere apologies to the real fans, the Force is not given to everybody). Second best would be Episode 4: pleasant, not too serious, sets a mythology, however the style and special effects are dated. Third best would be Episode 5: truly great scenes, yet there is too much talk about the Force and Darth Vader's revelation he is Luke's father falls flat (sorry, fans). Then Episodes 2 and 3: some good scenes but mostly over the top. Episodes 1, 6 and 7 have already fallen into oblivion.-----'Rogue One' reviews are very contrasting. Some fans find it great, others feel cheated, which I can understand: the movie is not overwhelming and does not renew the saga. Yet it is entertaining, no-nonsense and visually impressive.Indeed, appreciating action movies is very subjective because the border is thin between good and terrible. There is a subtle balance to find in dialogues, pacing, action, emotions and music: too much or too little of an ingredient, and it flops. Also, impeccable acting is paramount: the same role can feel awesome or awful depending on who plays it. For instance in 'Rogue One', Chirrut and Baze are credible, individually and as a pair; however with less good actors they would just have been laughable. Likewise, the same dialogue can feel right or inane depending on how it is said (for instance between Galen and Orson or when Jyn and Saw meet again). Hence appreciation can easily fluctuate from one side to the opposite.The main reason for this volatility is that action movies essentially rely on form with limited content, and form alone is always on the edge since it cannot be compensated by interesting substance. To me 'Rogue One' passes the test, to an extent.",7,1,4,9 January 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The Emperor has no clothes
","Once upon a time in Hollywood, there was a famed Director-Emperor who mainly based his movies on violence. Sometimes he combined it with a pinch of humour ('Pulp Fiction', 'Django Unchained'). He carefully selected his soundtracks; maybe he should have become a D.J... As for substance, there was none.Rhythm and editing looked masterly, yet chiefly relied on violence. Nonlinear plots were praised, even though they were no innovation by far. Spirit seemed offbeat, whilst actually violence had become mainstream since long (Peckinpah, De Palma, Scorsese, John Woo, spaghetti westerns, etc.). Depiction of violence was deemed entertaining, however it was complacent and morally dubious. Style looked cool, but resembled video-clips'. Overall, if his movies were no better or worse than many Hollywood action pictures, they rapidly became cult, demonstrating that haemoglobin and flashy style always are easy pleasers.Despite his box-office hits, our Director was sometimes melancholic. He longed to prove he was an accomplished director not limited to a genre; he wanted to do something different, a movie without much bloodshed: yes, a real opus with content and not just form. He could do it! So he directed 'Jackie Brown' in 1997, and fans realised the Emperor had no clothes: without violence, it had nothing to show. Hence he afterwards reverted to the same good old gorish style.The vision of content still lingered in his mind, though. Time was getting short: he had promised he would only direct ten movies in his career. According to his own account, he directed eight before 2019 (more by other accounts, but we would not want to be deprived of additional masterpieces, would we?). Hence the next one, his ninth, had to be the good one! (He could afterwards crown his career with what he could do best, an apotheosis of unrestrained brutality.) He had a plan; he would not make the same mistake as for 'Jackie Brown', where setting was contemporary: he would direct a period movie, depicting the past and actual persons to miraculously generate content. So he directed 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood'. And the Emperor was naked again.<ul><li>There is no rhythm, since there is practically no violence to support it. The movie drags on and on and on for 2h40. Scenes are uselessly long: Sharon watches the film she plays in; Cliff goes to Spahn Ranch; Rick plays in 'Lancer' series. The latter does not show anything about directing; it is not interesting; it is barely parodic; it is not funny. Even some short scenes make no sense, for instance Rick and his wife unboarding the plane: what is the point of the slow motion? If the movie were cut down by a full hour, it would not be radically different. By contrast, the most memorable part is the carnage at the end, reviving Tarantino's good old style with energy and macabre farce. Spot on.</li></ul><ul><li>There is no consistent story, rather a succession of scenes. It would be fine if there were some substance, but there is none, as opposed to good pictures about Hollywood as we will see.</li></ul><ul><li>There is no insight about Hollywood, as opposed to <a href='/title/tt0043014/'>Sunset Blvd. (1950)</a> or <a href='/title/tt0105151/'>The Player (1992)</a> or <a href='/title/tt3203606/'>Trumbo (2015)</a>. Location and era are just a background, a pretext to make a period movie. Granted, there are references to Hollywood pictures, including Tarantino's, but without much purpose.</li></ul><ul><li>There is no historical accuracy since the so-called 'Manson family' is depicted as a bunch of pathetic amateurs failing their mission, instead of dangerous killers. What is the point of a ludicrous ending instead of showing compassion for five actual victims (of which an eight-month pregnant woman)? Actually, Tarantino is not interested by history, as show 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'Django Unchained' which deform grave events (WWII, slavery): at best, they would be uchronias. Some call it artistic licence, I call it lack of respect.</li></ul><ul><li>There is no character depth, as opposed to <a href='/title/tt0044391/'>The Bad and the Beautiful (1952)</a> or <a href='/title/tt0047880/'>The Big Knife (1955)</a> or <a href='/title/tt0074777/'>The Last Tycoon (1976)</a>. Rick feels his career is behind him and... well, that's it. We don't know anything else about him, nor do we about all other characters. Many are based on actual persons, but we learn very little about their life.</li></ul><ul><li>There is little humour, as opposed to <a href='/title/tt1655442/'>The Artist (2011)</a> or <a href='/title/tt0475290/'>Hail, Caesar! (2016)</a>. Some dialogues are funny, but spread over such a long time, they represent an average of one every half hour.</li></ul><ul><li>There is a stretched racist scene whereby a stupid arrogant Asian (Bruce Lee) makes a fool out of himself and then is ridiculed by a smart strong white man (Cliff). It is aggravated by the fact Mike Moh is the only non-white actor of the plethoric cast, which already says something about the movie (for info: there were ethnic minorities in 1969 USA). Tarantino is not racist, but the scene, intentionally or not, certainly is; anyone who does not believe so is probably not Asian. A typical mistake from a director who does not really think about the potential impact of his work. As a side note, if Cliff is just a stuntman, he does not stand the slightest chance against Bruce Lee; he might be a martial arts expert, but since we don't know anything about him, we cannot tell.</li></ul>So 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' slowly flows by. It is not terrible, just mediocre: without violence, nothing stands out. Interestingly, it not only exposes its own downsides, but by contrast Tarantino's other movies' main deficiency: over-reliance on easy violence as a fig leaf for lack of substance.I don't have an issue with action pictures, as long as they are technically and ethically decent (which to be fair Tarantino's partly are), and are not taken for more than what they stand for: entertainment. But I have trouble understanding why Tarantino should be praised more than other directors of the genre. And I do have an issue with unnecessary, complacent and dubious depiction of brutality. Fortunately 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' is Tarantino's ninth movie: one more and he will be relieved from his promise. As will we.PS: Apologies to Tarantino fans for this firm review, even though I refrained from expanding upon Tarantino's decades-long passivity in the Weinstein affair.",4,3,10,2 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Has the Saga reached its limits?
","Sorry fans, we need to face it: the SW saga might have come to a dead-end, and it is not a once-off consequence of the latest Episode's failures (on this, more below). It is rather the opposite: the failures are the logical consequence of the saga reaching its limits. Yes, the arguably most famous franchise in the world (and not only in cinema), after creating a mythology that fascinated millions of fans over the last forty years, has demonstrated that the universe is finite.WHAT HAPPENED?Quick flashback. In Episodes 1 to 6, George Lucas created a simple but strong concept, uniting three themes: filiation, the Force and good versus evil. (As a reminder, Lucas directed four of the six Episodes and wrote all of them.) In summary, how a father Anakin and his son Luke dealt with the bright and dark sides of the Force. The main character of Episodes 1-3 is Anakin, while in Episodes 4-6 it is Luke, with Anakin's strong presence despite his relatively limited appearances. All other themes are secondary, notably the struggle between the Empire and rebels: it is a background story. For instance, we never see how inhabitants of the galaxy live differently before and after the Empire seized power. SW is not about politics, the marginal exception being the Senate debates in Episodes 2 and 3.This strong backbone built on the three themes provided unity and progression to the six original Episodes, as we followed Anakin's iconic story throughout: childhood, training, relationship with Padme, marriage, turning to the dark side, Luke's and Leia's births, discovery of filiation, parent-child relationship, redemption, death. These events echoed everyday life, transposed to an epic level: for instance, everyone has a bright and a dark side; here it is dramatically depicted in the flesh (detractors will say naively). With Anakin's death, the destruction of the Empire and Luke being the ultimate Jedi defending the bright side, the saga was over.WHERE ARE WE NOW?The main issue with Episodes 7 and 8 is they recycle the original concept, developing no new form or, if they do, overplaying it. Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is the new Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vador (note they both have two names), moving between the bright and the dark sides. To a large extent, Rey is the new Luke, orphan wondering about her parents, learning about the Force and being unsuccessfully appealed by Kylo to the dark side. Rey and Kylo distantly communicate as Luke and Anakin did in Episodes 5 and 6 (note the similarity between the names Rey and Ren). Luke is the new Yoda, exiled on a remote planet and teaching Rey about the Force. Even side themes are similar: First Order is the new Empire; Snoke is the new Darth Sidious; the good guys struggle but eventually win or escape at the end.Even scenes are similar. Darth Vador brings Luke to Darth Sidious in Episode 6: Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, down to details (e.g. Snoke undoes Rey's handcuffs, for no reason actually). Battle on the white planet Hoth where the Empire's AT-ATs face the rebels' stronghold in Episode 5: battle on the white planet Crait where First Order's AT-ATs face the rebels' stronghold (the only difference is snow is replaced by... salt!). Ewoks from Episode 6 are replaced by other silly animals (porgs, fathiers, crystal wolves). Etcetera. And then of course space battles, ground battles, lightsaber fights, etc. but that is part of the standard SW catalogue.However copying previous Episodes does not prevent from gaping plot holes. Luke is just a grumpy old man, while Yoda was an intriguing character, funny yet powerful. We don't know anything about Snoke, while we followed Palpatine/Darth Sidious for a long time. So when Snoke goes down, we don't feel it is an important victory. Regenerating a saga requires more than a lazy script. Side stories don't fare better, for instance the lengthy yet shallow relationship between Rose and Finn. To be fair, Episode 8 does have a few qualities. Landscapes are gorgeous notably Luke's island. The final battle on Crait in white and red is spectacular although flawed. When Holdo crashes her spaceship into the First Order spaceship, the resulting images and silence are stunning (silence at last as it should be, since there are no sounds in space). The connection between Rey and Kylo is convincing. Some dialogues are good. CGI is better as ever, but then it is not a sufficient quality nowadays.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Strategically, the studio only has three options to expand the saga:1. Continue in the tradition of the former six Episodes. This will likely result in going around in circles, because we have pretty much exhausted the original three themes.2. Find a new style, for instance political fiction, comedy or tale. But would it still be SW or something else?3. A combination of the two above, which Episode 8 partly is: on top of reprocessing the saga, it includes some politics (casino, arms business, female hero), comedy (dialogues, situations, porgs) and tale (fathiers, crystal wolves, the ending with children). Yet cinematographically it is very difficult to successfully mix styles, as the relative failure of Episode 8 proves. Commercially however it is a smart move, because the studio can target new audiences, notably children with comedy and tale, thus ensuring long-term revenues, like the original SW fans provided for the last forty years.Apart from expanding the saga, the studio can deep-dive into former Episodes with spin-offs on how the rebels found the plans to the death star ('Rogue One'), about Han Solo's life, etc. So instead of going broad, they can go deep. Naturally to make money by seducing new audiences without repelling the original fans, they will do both. The former SW created a myth and a business; it now is a business about recycling the myth.",4,1,2,15 January 2018
Annie Hall," Stand-up comedy with depth
","When Woody Allen stars in one of his movies, you either love it or hate it. In the latter case, you can find it wordy, narcissistic, confused and neurotic. If you love it, well, you'll find it... wordy, narcissistic, confused and neurotic... but with talent!If we wanted to categorise Allen's films, we could discern a first period that ends with 'Annie Hall': these are generally comedies that look like a succession of sketches. As a reminder, before being a playwright and a film director, Allen started his career as a comedy writer and then a stand-up comedian, for almost twenty cumulated years: this influenced his first pictures.After 'Annie Hall', he found a style where comedy, if present, is a supporting element instead of a central focus. This movie is hence a turning point in Allen's career; it certainly is the best of his first period, and arguably one of his best ever. With retrospect, it seems as if he wanted to crown his first style before moving on to something different.STAND-UP, WOODY/ALVY!'Annie Hall' feels like a stand-up long feature, which constitutes its originality as well as its limit. The stand-up comedy style is fully assumed: it starts with Allen telling two jokes to the audience, and ends with another joke. The main character is a comedian and we see him on stage once, a reference to Allen's former career. Revealingly, he narrates the whole story. There is a self-parody component, whereby Allen caricatures himself as Alvy and the tone is detached.Throughout the movie there is at least a joke every minute, addressing very different topics, some of them serious, albeit generally in a light mode: life, love, death, the universe, relationships, time passing, childhood, WWII, knowledge, culture, humour, lifestyles, Jewish identity, psychoanalysis, drugs, sex and how (not) to cook a lobster.The movie is loaded with funny directing tricks. Even if most of them are not new, they efficiently support the humorous tone and keep the audience focused, since the stand-up style on its own is difficult to sustain on the long term: talking to the audience, placing the adult character in childhood scenes, having characters comment past scenes shown to them, subtitling characters' thoughts as they talk about something else, introducing a cartoon sequence, having an actual celebrity (McLuhan) intervening in the fiction, etc.VOYAGE INTO ALVY'S BRAIN...However 'Annie Hall' is more than this. Form, far from being random, is clever. Narration is non-linear, transitions are frequently made by thought associations (as in psychoanalysis), past and present mingle, shots are on average long: we are in Alvy's brain.Progressively, the movie gains depth, as the relationship between the main two characters evolves. Annie Hall matures from a naive woman, intellectually dominated by Alvy, to an elaborate lady who knows what she wants, while Alvy stagnates with his issues. (Here we must ask: what does the beautiful, classy, witty Annie find in the neurotic, possessive, paranoid Alvy? Answer: the mysteries of love.)... AND NOSTALGIAAdditionally, the movie increasingly becomes nostalgic. What gives it a special touch is the fact the story between the main two characters is partly inspired by the actual relationship between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton themselves: Keaton's actual family name is Hall and her nickname is Annie; Keaton admitted she recognised herself in the role; Allen and Keaton had a relationship for about a year in 1970, broke up and remained friends as in the movie. The fact the actual relationship ended approximately six years before the film adds a melancholic element.Retrospection is an essential theme. At the beginning we see past scenes (childhood, flashbacks), mainly in humorous mode. Occasionally some past scenes are tragic, for instance WWII with an extract of the documentary 'The Sorrow and the Pity', followed by the characters asking themselves: what would we have done during these troubled times?Increasingly, past elements are not coming from 'outside' of the movie (i.e. before the love story) but 'within'. This creates a nostalgic feeling: the happy times we witnessed are now gone. For instance when Alvy comes to Annie's place to chase the spider after they broke up, on her wall are the photos she took when he was previously struggling with the lobsters. Later on, Alvy dates another woman and again tries to cook lobsters. However while the earlier lobster scene was funny, his new date does not understand his humour: we are sorry the relationship between Alvy and Annie has ended, with their complicity and wits. At the end, Annie goes to see 'The Sorrow and the Pity' as she did before with Alvy, even though now they are separated.Accentuating the sense of nostalgia, the whole movie actually is a flashback made by Alvy about his relationship with Annie. Eventually, the end sequence culminates in nostalgic mood: past scenes between Alvy and Annie silently flow, while Annie sings off-screen 'Seems Like Old Times', a melancholic song if there ever was one. They are now simple friends; instead of spending time together, they just have a drink in a café. In the last shot, Alvy stays on the sidewalk to watch Annie leave: he still is in love with her.On top of flashbacks, this final sequence subtly refers to earlier episodes: a final nail in past's coffin. Annie singing refers to her previously singing 'It Had to be You' in the nightclub. But whereas the nightclub sequence was a noisy disaster, the final song is perfect: past scenes then shown are hence beautified and idealised. Also, Alvy makes a final joke about the absurdity of relationships: it closes the loop with his two jokes at the very beginning of the movie. However instead of facing the audience, his voice is now off-screen: without Annie, he fades into a shadow of his former self.Funny, nostalgic, partly absurd (as life is), sometimes awkward (as life is), 'Annie Hall' does deliver the eggs.",9,3,5,19 August 2016
Son of Saul," A poignant but debatable attempt to film Auschwitz
","WHY FILM SHOAH?Movies about the Shoah (or Holocaust) cannot be solely discussed on the same grounds as other movies e.g. plot, acting, direction, camera, settings, etc. They raise questions about history, remembrance and ethics.Some persons debate the fact that Shoah CAN be filmed and, if the answer is positive, HOW it should be filmed. A 'bad' movie (in terms of plot, acting, etc.) about Shoah is not just tedious, it could be considered as a lack of respect to the victims and survivors of camps and ghettos, as well as to their families. Even a 'good' movie that inaccurately depicts Shoah could be considered as a lack of respect. For instance, director Claude Lanzmann (documentaries 'Shoah', 'Sobibor', etc.) strongly rejected 'Schindler's List' even though in pure cinematographic terms it is compelling. For information the same Lanzmann approved of 'Son of Saul'.However these two questions (can and how) mainly result from a more fundamental question: WHY film Shoah? The most obvious answer is history and remembrance. But then why not only film documentaries (above-mentioned Lanzmann, 'Night and Fog' by Resnais, etc.) and write books (Primo Levi, Semprun, etc.)? Do we really need filmed fiction about Shoah?The strength about fiction is it can convey more emotion, but that is also its danger: can any emotion render the absolute horror? Are we not fooled by our empathy when maybe there is no possible empathy? Of course the distinction between documentary and fiction is not so clear-cut, since documentaries use artistic features (editing, commentary, sometimes music, etc.), while fictions can be filmed as documentaries. This is where 'Son of Saul' comes in and I apologise for this long, but I think necessary, introduction.AMBITIOUS YET SUBJECTIVE VISIONFirst, we cannot classify this movie as a mere 'Description of a day in Auschwitz' or a 'Movie where Shoah is a secondary element', but fundamentally as a movie about Shoah, by its ambition, its clear historical references and its intensity. I will not detail the plot, this is available elsewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, it is a very violent, disturbing movie (rated R in the US but I would not recommend it to anybody below 17 even accompanied by an adult).'Son of Saul' avoids the pitfall of voyeurism by focusing on the main character, Saul, and mainly showing what he sees. The dead bodies are mostly blurred, the cries are mostly distant. However this radical precept which is carried throughout all the movie (except for the last few minutes) almost constitutes a second-degree voyeurism where the director constantly seems to affirm 'Look how I avoid showing you fully what is happening'.Hence this strength of subjective view almost becomes a weakness as we empathise with Saul, notably his desire to bury what he thinks is his son, but less with other characters, even when his quest jeopardises the rebellion project. We do see to some extent how prisoners survive and die in the camp, but as a background to Saul's obsessive idea. Is the dead boy really his son? Is the rabbi really a rabbi or does he just want Saul's protection? Where is the body? Will they manage to bury it? So in a way the fiction of Saul blurs the documentary dimension of Auschwitz.CAN A MOVIE ABOUT SHOAH EVER BE ACCURATE?In most regards, 'Son of Saul' is historically accurate: the inhumane conditions, the constant struggle, the fights between prisoners, the role of the Kapos, the barbaric SS, the bargains, etc. As a side note, it also convincingly reconstitutes the way one of the authentic and very rare pictures from Auschwitz could have been taken by insiders (the pile of bodies outside).However actual conditions were certainly even more dramatic than those depicted: in general prisoners were much thinner and weaker, their clothes were dirty rags, their morale was very low, every moment was a tragedy. Also some elements cannot be shown easily: how do you film hunger, cold, pain, illness, despair? Can we blame the movie for not showing the full extent of the horror? I am not sure, because it might actually not be possible and even if it were, it would barely be watchable.It is difficult to rate such a movie. Should we rate a movie about Shoah? Considering the artists take the responsibility of making and showing it and hence of being exposed to criticism, probably we may, if we are careful enough to distinguish between aesthetics and ethics.For its audacity and cinematographic qualities 'Son of Saul' probably rates 8 or 9/10: direction and acting are outstanding. For what we could call the 'Shoah ethics' that I tried to describe in the introduction, I think it rates 6/10: a poignant but debatable attempt. Again, I am not sure any fiction could do much better. This is a personal point of view and I fully understand some persons were compelled and would rate it 10/10, or that others reject the movie with a 1/10. It really depends how one's own feelings react to such extreme images and artistic vision.",7,44,61,25 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The farce awakens: artificial remake of previous Episodes
","There are two ways to watch an action movie. Either one forgets about one's critical sense and simply enjoys action, settings, visual and sound effects, etc. (I wish I could do this.) To be fair, on most of these accounts 'Star Wars 7 - The Force Awakens' (SW7) delivers, notably the beginning in the desert (for instance the fighter chase among the imperial ships graveyard) and the beautiful final sequence on the island.Either one cannot help thinking about plot, characters, themes, etc. On these accounts, SW7 fails. I might be too critical, but after a moment I thought 'Wait, we've seen all of this before...', and afterwards '... done in a better way...', and finally '... so what is the point?' The movie is not really boring, it actually is quite enjoyable, but its flaws keep polluting the few qualities.*** WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS ***As highlighted by many critics, SW7 copies previous Episodes (notably 4): a planet of sand, the imperial army looking for a droid with secret plans, a villain with a dark mask and a dark cape, the same who turned from the bright side to the dark, a father and son on opposite sides (only reversed), good guys wandering into the villains' base, a death planet protected by a shield, ultimately destroyed by a raid of x-wing fighters, etc. Hence the movie feels more like a remake of Episode 4 with alterations than a sequel.Incidentally SW7 also uses material from other movies: the top villain looks like an orc from 'The Hobbit'; when Rey first touches the lightsaber, she has visions like Frodo using the ring in 'The Lord of the Rings'; Han Solo's spaceship with captured and escaped monsters reminds of 'Alien' series.This would be acceptable if it were shot in a new way. Unfortunately, not only the movie adds nothing to previous Episodes, but it falls short by many aspects. Below are a few examples only, space lacks to list more.1. Bigger is better. To have old stuff look new, just make it BIGGER: huge death planet, monstrous hologram of top villain, destruction of many planets instead of just one, gigantic collapses on the death planet, loads of explosions and fighting. Heavy historical references too: the stormtrooper gathering looks like a nazi meeting.2. Forget about dramatic build-up. In Episode 4, when the death star destroys a planet, it is a tragedy: there is suspense, tension, a gigantic explosion, grief, a Jedi feels disruption in the Force. Here the planet explodes, done, next scene. Also in previous Episodes, a character would learn about the Force at great length. This is serious stuff, remember Luke with Yoda in Episodes 5 and 6. Here Rey catches up instantly, using mind control, shooting, performing telekinesis and ultimately defeating Kylo Ren in an unbelievable lightsaber fight.3. Character depth, what is that? The main villain is supposed to be frightening, which he is until a certain point... then he just becomes ridiculous. He speaks to Darth Vador's melted helmet as if he could get an answer from it (generally, kids stop talking to objects when they are five years old). He takes his mask off for no reason in front of Rey, hence removing all mystery from the character. Just out of curiosity, why do your wear this if you don't need it to breathe like Darth Vador? Oh, because it looks and sounds cool (kids stop dressing up when they are ten). Eventually the sequence with Han Solo reaches abysses of silliness: sure I'll remove my mask (again), do I want to go home with you, I don't know, well why not, yes please help me, then maybe not, haha you're dead. Illustrating inner ambiguity and conflict requires more subtlety.Other characters don't fare much better. It is hard to believe Finn turning against First Order in the beginning. Rey's role mainly consists of action scenes, we do not see much else of her. Her flirt with Finn looks fake. Poe does not have much of a role, which is unfortunate because Oscar Isaac is a good actor. It is a deceit we only see a few seconds of Max von Sydow. Only does Han Solo provide a bit of depth, partly scoundrel, partly wiser, partly pathetic old man who lost his wife and son.4. Plot consistency, where? Poe and Rey both escape easily because they are just guarded by a single stormtrooper. At the end, four good guys have no issues moving around the heavily guarded starkiller base, finding the central part which is surprisingly unguarded, planting bombs there and escaping all this (if it weren't for Han Solo's grotesque attempt to talk to his son). Also, the end of this sequence, which according to the countdown is supposed to last less than two minutes, actually lasts more than ten on screen and plot-wise probably more than half an hour considering all the action going on.5. There is nothing like good dialogues. Unfortunately these are rare in SW7. They are lacking impact, wit and humour. For memo, the only best lines are: 'I talk first or you talk first?' (Poe to Kylo), 'The droid stole a freighter?' (Kylo) and 'Really, you're cold!' (Han to Chewie). All considered, the funniest dialogues and expressions are from the droid BB-8.To summarise, the director was probably so impressed taking over the franchise that he wanted to deliver a safe, standard no-brainer, but precisely because of this lack of creativity he failed. He used old recipes but instead of enhancing them he reduced them to caricatures. Anyhow, the studio was happy to cash in the expensively acquired concept, regardless of quality.",3,11,12,28 January 2016
Spectre," Decent first half... then mostly laughable
","Do you want to direct the next James Bond movie? Here are 10 simple tips.1. Over-inflate the conspiracy theory. Here the head of British Intelligence is part of Spectre (the organisation). Utterly incredible whichever angle you look from. For the next movie, think about the Queen of England or the Pope as Spectre #2 (since conveniently for a sequel #1 is still alive).2. Add family bonds. Here Spectre #1 is James' adoptive brother. Totally useless but fun. Next movie: cast Darth Vader saying 'James, I am your father'.3. Plan a few incredible escapes. Here Blofeld tortures Bond without removing his bomb-watch (everybody knows Bond's watch is just to give the time, right?) and leaves his accomplice free so she can recuperate the device. Next movie: Blofeld should tickle Bond unattached leaving him a gun in one hand and a grenade in another.4. Teach all these villains how to shoot and give them real ammunition. Here they seem to shoot randomly with blank bullets, missing Bond and/or Swann on various occasions notably outside their own premises.5. Transplant a brain to the same villains. Here they are expecting Bond at the Spectre meeting and try to capture him... but they don't immobilise his car, do not close the gates and don't have 10 killers surrounding him at once, just one Mickey Mouse. Also they have rings containing all the data from the whole Spectre organisation. It's very fair of villains to give out as much information as they are hacking.6. Actually transplant a brain to Bond himself since he prefers to have a dangerous car chase in a city and crash a useful car instead of just stopping and shooting the single villain behind him. That's what he's paid for, isn't he?7. Plan a few spectacular explosions, as in the movie when Bond takes ONE shot at ONE gas pipe... and all of the gigantic Spectre complex vanishes into thin air.8. Recycle good old Bond stuff: parade (Thunderball), death masks (Live And Let Die), helicopter in the opening sequence (For Your Eyes Only), tracker in Bond's arm (Casino Royale), building on top of a mountain (On Her Majesty's Secret Service), fight in a train (From Russia with Love), boat chase on Thames (The World Is Not Enough), car chase (various), snow chase (various), etc. etc.9. Throw in as much money as you want, payback will be enormous even in 2D. Crash a lot of cars, get some stolen in a parking lot, plan many shooting locations, have action, explosions, action and more action. Forget about cheap ideas like a solid plot and character depth as there were for instance in 'Casino Royale'.10. To be fair to the movie: as in 'Spectre', have good actors, some funny dialogue, thrilling scenes (Mexico), superb settings (Rome), slow scenes to enhance rhythm (Spectre meeting, hotel l'Americain, train station in the desert), criticism of the dangers of total surveillance. Unfortunately most of these good elements happen in the first part of the movie only (roughly up to the Spectre complex in the desert).",4,13,25,23 November 2015
