Mission: Impossible III," hilarious
","Best Hollywood Flick i've seen for a long time, except Capote which also was a whole lot of fun. P.Seymour Hoffmann is an awesome actor. I first saw him in the excellent movie 'Dead Poet Society' and he's getting better and better in every movie. In 25th hour i was glad to see him back to the big screen. Cruise is good as expected, that means good as one can be as an action character. The other characters are fitting in also well, thanks to a good and mostly logical script.The action is breathtaking.The plot developed so fast that i missed some details, some unanswered questions remained, but were whirled away by another turn in the script. There are a lot of turning points, which were a lot more surprising then in the previous M:I flicks. The first and second M:I movies are by all means worse than the third one.I watched it as cam-rip of the net, because the movie-industry is behind technical possibilities for greedy reasons as usual. E.g. like Television net income passed Hollywood in the middle of the last century.Talking of political correctness, i think i witnessed some of it in the movie when the bad boy said that the US will do what it can best, (declare war) Clean Up, Democracy, blah blah.I will definitely go to cinemas to watch it with my girlfriend. She might like it also for the romantic moments which were very enjoyable for an action movie. There's no typical Hollywood stickiness.I can't wait to watch it on a big cinema-scope screen. Well done Hollywood.",10,2,5,11 May 2006
50 First Dates," Adam Sandler most talented film-maker in Hollywood
","Since the first Sandler movie i watched, i -felt- the movies of Sandler. They were always very funny, adorable and a kind of dramatic. Of course on a very light level, but everything always fitted together. The best part is, that he doesn't take himself or one of his characters he is directing to serious. Movies that takes themselves to serious make me sick. That's why i like Bollywood movies, if you see Sharukan ( i know, its 3 words..) acting, you realize that fast.In 50 First Dates we of course don't see high-level acting Hollywood Giants, i don't want to compare him to Clint Eastwood or Al Pacino. But in his way, he his delivering a message to me and i'm receiving it. Enjoy live, be honest to others and laugh a lot. Thats a feeling all of his movies left me with.In this movie, additional to the usual funny and weird characters surrounding Sandler, one can experience a very good acting Drew Barrymore, which perfectly fits into this movie. She is fitting to the other characters in this film in a very sweet way: They all don't fulfill common expectations. I really enjoyed the movie and think its one of Sandlers best - IF you are in the mood for a love story.",9,0,1,22 September 2005
