Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas, not loosing his touch, changing his focus.
","Some years after it came out and there are still people buzzing about this movie.  Comparing and defending it against the others.Here is my thought on the entire situation as made obvious in this 4th presentation: Episode 1.I was 4 years old in 1977, I remember waiting in line for 2 or 3 showings (4 or 6 hours) so that we could watch 'Star Wars'.  Even at the age of 4 I was able to understand enough of what was going on to watch it more often than I have ever seen another movie.  By the time 'The Empire Strikes Back' came out, I had seen Star Wars over 50 times, this all in theaters as VCRs were not known back then.  I then watched #5 a lot and then #6 3 or 4 times. When I saw 'Return Of the Jedi' I was still young, yet saw that Lucas was dumbing down the story for the kids.  It still had its good moments yet was not as interesting as #4.I was working in a movie theater when the redigitized version came out about 1997 and watched them a few times when we had them.  And then when #1 came out I was very excited.  But Lucas decided that he wanted to make films for his grandkids rather than people that knew the story.  Fine it is his movie, do what you will, but my thoughts are this.  You don't need to talk down to kids to make them enjoy movies.  He could have kept the same seriousness in 'Jedi' and 'Phantom' as he did 'A New Hope' and still make kids enjoy them. Jar-Jar and the Frog-King's 'shake the head and make the cheeks splatter' are just a few ways to tell parents that this movie is not intended for people that know the plot, but rather for the kids of people that know the plot.He is no longer making Sci-Fi movies, but rather 'After-School specials'. Jake Lloyd was too old for the part he was playing, but they said he was perfect, so they kept him... WHY?  Yes he is a child actor and he wasn't that great, but a 4 year-old could not have done a worse job.  Why didn't they find a kid the age Anakin was suposed to be and just live with the fact kids can't act, Jake couldn't either.  We were suposed to feel sorry for Anakin, but Jake made me think, what a brat, why do they want to make YOU a Jedi so bad.  There was nothing endearing about him, even when he left his mom, she didn't seem too sorry to see him go.Even in the Indiana movies you can see Lucas making the series into kids movies.  He tried so hard to get the movie industry to get their SFX better so that he could redo #4 the way he intended, so much so that he made his own effects system, yet in #1 he hid behind the effects and decided not to put any effort in the story.Lucas is no longer a producer of good movies, just over priced, pre-school kids movies with a lot of special effects.",2,0,1,24 October 2002
Fight Club," A lot more than its commercials.
","When I saw the commercials for this and even after my brother said it was a better film than he thought it would be, it wasn't until he actually rented it for me that I realized this movie was nothing like its commercials lead on. I was expecting a modernized version of the 70's Kung-fu movies, but with the added 'Go out and stomp some schmuck off the streets' message to it.I was not expecting it to be a thought out story where someone took the time to hide an actually good moral in the entertainment. Tyler's true intentions are explained when he tells Jack why he sent the convenience store clerk home. If you are reading this, you probably already saw it, but if you have not and are just curious, I say it is definitely worth the time, if you are in for a multi-layered movie that can mix immediate audio and visual stimulus as well as a lasting story line that you can scrutinize over for a long time to come.  And if not for any of these reasons, there are probably more 'Good' Memorable Quotes in this movie than you could use in a year.",10,0,1,26 November 2001
Memento," How do you make the audience feel like they have amnesia?
","The main character has short term memory loss, can remember things before the accident, but everything after, he can only remember for a few minutes. He tries everything he can to remember things, from taking polaroid pictures of where his apartment is to tattooing messages to himself on his body.  The story was a very intriguing one all by itself, but the way the film was presented was even better.  I don't think I have ever seen a movie do such a good job of making the audience feel like they couldn't remember anything either.  Usually if you are watching, you know what happens before, so memory isn't an issue, but here, your memory doesn't help you very much. I thought it was well done in directing, cinematography and just an all around good plot. If you are going to rent this, give yourself enough time to watch it a few times before you return it.",10,1,2,31 January 2002
We Were Soldiers," Presented less like a Viet Nam movie, but more like WW2
","This film reminded me the film 'Tora, Tora, Tora!' rather than the other Viet Nam movies that I have seen.  In 'We were Soldiers' they actualy let you see the war from both sides.  Rather than the NVA as a group of silhouettes relentlessly advancing with seamingly no agenda, you watch as the officers plan the attacks as their soldiers write in their journals and think of their families.  You see the other side of the battle where they were scared but still attacked for their country.I think that showing both sides of the battle makes you realize that they were not shooting faceless people but rather husbands, sons, fathers, and that they would rather be home and happy just like anyone else, but that circumstances placed them in a situation to where they had to fight or die like their counterparts.  Then watching the American soldier's wives after their husbands died makes you wonder if the NVA wives were told in a similar manor.",7,1,2,19 September 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," I hated this the first time too.
","I saw there were a couple people that watched this once and hated it. When I first watched it, I was about 17.  My younger brother was watching it and just cracking up.  I thought it was boring and never even bothered to watch all of it.  What is weird is that I even liked the flying circus and watched it all the time, but this movie was just, 'BLAH'A few years later I was in a remote area for a year (Yosemite National Park) and there was nothing to do at night except watch TV if you had one.  One night the local bar had a 'Locals Only' party and the Holy Grail was the feature. 'DAMN, not that again' I thought.  But I got there and everyone was hysterical and reciting the entire movie.  I think something I missed before finaly stuck and I realized what a great movie this was.  If you saw it once and hated it, find a bunch of friends that liked it, get a big party going and have a blast. That might show you what it is all about.  Although it is good when you are alone, it is soo much better with friends.Yes I do now own this on VHS along with other python movies but when I got a DVD player, this was the one I bought.  Meaning of life, Life of Brian, '...and now for something completely different...' are also good but Holy Grail just has something there that the others are missing.  Maybe they were more serious with the others or something, but the Grail is now on my top 10 movies list.",9,5,8,8 May 2002
