Antz," I was disappointed
","Maybe I was a victim of high expectations, but after all I had heard about it, I was disappointed in Antz.  The animation was interesting and enjoyable.  But you have to be a fan of Woody Allen to enjoy the story. And I am not.  I didn't realize the  plot was so similar to the typical Woody Allen movie - watching him deal with his neuroses.Hear that A Bug's Life is much better, looking forward to seeing it.",4,8,14,25 March 1999
50 First Dates," Surprisingly good
","I am not a big fan of Sandler's movies, most of his stuff I find too over the top and sometimes even cruel.  So I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy '50 First Dates' so much.  The only other movie of his I liked was 'The Wedding Singer', which also starred Sandler and Barrymore.  I guess that is the recipe I need for a Sandler movie - add Barrymore.  They have very good chemistry on the screen.  '50 First Dates' was funny - of course.  But it was also touching and warm. Also liked Rob Schneider, as Sandler's friend he was funny and outlandish. The guy just cracks me up.  Not an outstanding movie, but it's entertaining and fun to watch.  I felt good after watching it - that's enough.  I give it a 7 (out of 10).",7,0,0,30 August 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Huh? Why?
","Boy, am I glad that I watched this movie for free. I would have been very unhappy if I had paid even a dime to see it. What a terrible movie!! Easily the worst movie I saw in 2005. It sucked!!! Plot? We don't need a plot! It's George, Brad, Julia and Catherine. Everyone will just want to watch them. Cheadle, the other member's of Ocean's 11, and Garcia - why did they bother to even show up? The acting was wooden, the plot non-existent, the camera work annoying.At least Ocean's 11 was watchable and even fun. But this drivel is insulting. George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones acted in a movie called Intolerable Cruelty together, but this movie was intolerable cruelty to the viewer.And now I hear there may be an Ocean's 13! WHY?!?!?!",2,0,0,9 January 2006
Lilo & Stitch," What were they thinking?
","Lilo & Stitch is quite possibly (no strike that), IS the worst Disney animated film I have ever seen!!  It is just a bunch of video bites strung together - no plot, no point.  Ol' Walt must have been thinking, 'I gotta get back down there, it's falling apart.'I have seen most animated Disney pictures - the ones that came out when I was a kid and those that have come out since I became an adult, I can't remember any that are anywhere close to being this bad.  Then I see that Ebert gave it 3.5 stars and it scores 85 on RottenTomatoes, what am I missing?  But my wife agrees, there went an hour and a-half we will never get back.",2,2,10,24 February 2003
