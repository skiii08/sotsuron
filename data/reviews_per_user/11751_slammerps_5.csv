Requiem for a Dream," The most powerfuly disturbing movie EVER! and this just in... drugs are BAD?????
","I could go on and on about this movie. I saw it a day or two after it's premiere at the Boston Film Festival. I read a review on here from someone who said it was 'worth a 400 mile drive.' I didn't have to go that far, thank god... but knowing what I know now, I would have if needed, and it would have been worth it. This movie was powerful, and disturbing. Darren Aronofsky has a masterpiece on his hands. In my mind he could retire now, after his second movie, and still be put in the book of great directors, AND be near the front of the page. His direction is innovate, using not only visual tricks, but also using sound to move us through the journey. He has done this like nobody has done before. The score is awesome, and moving.This movie is rated NC-17, or unrated depending on who you speak with, but everyone should have a chance to see this film. It should be shown at DARE class in schools. Ellen Burstyn should win an oscar for her performance... Marlon Wayans, shockingly, was great. This movie will change the way you look at him forever. Jared Leto & Jennifer Connelly did awesome jobs.
I wish there was something objective, something bad, or negative I could say about this film... but there isn't. Darren Aronofsky is the future of Filmmaking!Usually in my reviews I try to put a clever 'don't see this movie if ___fill in black___ because' line near the end... But with Requiem for a Dream I won't, because like I said,
EVERYONE should see this film! There is no reason not to! Be moved! Be disturbed! Be amazed! You will, no ifs, ands or buts about it!Pete's Movie Rating: 10",10,0,0,19 January 2001
The Big Lebowski," Watch out Farrellys, Coen Brothers do a comedy funnier & smarter
","The Big Lebowski is about a man with balls, THE DUDE. It wasn't his fault someone urinated on his rug, but thats only the beginning of this laugh out loud comedy from the people who brought you FARGO.The Coen Brothers got so much critical acclaim for their previous film, that they decided to mix it up here. And they did, some critics loved it, some hated it, after seeing Fargo I have to admit it wasn't what I expected. But they roll enough solid laughs and camera tricks to satisfy even the most vengeful critic (get over it, they wanted to do a comedy, and they did it better then most).Scoring a perfect 300 is THE DUDE. He is the guy you wish you could be if you had the guts to throw all responsibility behind you and enjoy life not caring what people think of you or what you do. The Dude never was shown rolling a bowling ball during the movie despite most of it taking place during a bowling match involving him.And also scoring a perfect 300 (may-be he won't shoot me) is Walter played by John Goodman. Never better or louder, Goodman plays a Volcanic Vietnam Vet, who shouts paranoid logic and profanity.Steve Buscemi may have had a good score but every time he tried to talk Walter told him to shut the ____ up, So I give him a 250. Hey what can I say, he played the 'loser in the group' better than most.And last but not least, a 200 to John Turturro who played a Hispanic pedophile bowling champ named Jesus.Pete's Movie Rating (out of 10): 9",8,0,1,11 January 2001
Save the Last Dance," A teen movie that tries, Stiles impresses
","This film is not about dancing, or a white girl in a black person world... It's about an interracial relationship between Sara and Derek. Sara is played by Julia Stiles who stared in Ten things I hate About You, a teen adaption of Shakespears: Tamping of the Shrew. You can't compare the two movies, other than the fact that both of them were well liked by critics, while still being classified as 'teen movies.'Stiles has what it takes to be a star in hollywood. If one thing that this movie proves, it's that Stiles will go on to bigger and better things (or atleast so I hope).I have read a few reviews knocking the dialogue in the film as being simple. I thought that it was better in that way because most teen movies contain teens with quirky smart talk that never happens in real life.The movie starts off simple and leads you on a journey with many twists that you don't expect.

Back to the Future," The best movie of all TIME
","It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another. A classic fish out of water story. I think what makes this movie so great is the people involved.Robert Zemeckis is one of the best sci-fi directors of our time. It's funny how it takes a big budget movie like Cast Away (2000) to make people take notice.FOX & LLoyd should win the nobel prize for chemistry. Brown is overexcited in his speeches, and his exaggerated facial expressions put Vince McMahon's (WWF) to shame.And Thomas Willson (BIFF) & Crispin Glover (George McFly) gave it their all, including possibly the best performances of their life.Back to the future is one of those movies where you believe in the characters, as much comic book as they are, and as hard as you try, you just can't pick a favorite. It's a popcorn movie that can be watched over and over again. And every time you watch it you will notice something you didn't spot before (check out the imdb trivia for this one).Pete's Movie Rating (out of 10): 1.21 jigawattsWhat the hell's a jigawatt?? Better than a 10, if thats possible!",10,1,2,11 January 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Odyssey gets a royal make-over, Coen Brothers Style!
","The Coen Brothers will always continue to amaze me. This movie was awesome, the photography of the movie is stunning, and the story pulls you into the journey.Their earlier, most acclaimed film 'Fargo', was a mean-spirited parody on dumb talking Minnesotans, instead this movie picked on the dumb talking people of Mississippi. OBWAT is a celebration of Southern culture, especially the folk music, (which for no aparent reason almost made the film itself.George Clooney did the best perfomance of his life, as only the Coen's can bring out. The Coen regulars did an awesome job once again.See this movie, even if you think the trailer looks stupid, or if you've never seen a Coen Brothers movie before... it's never too late to start, and be reborn (if you will).
