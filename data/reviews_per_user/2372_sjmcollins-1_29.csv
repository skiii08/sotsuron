Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great, ten times better than Vol. 1
","Great dialogue and great action scenes make Kill Bill-Vol. 2 Quentin Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction.  I really wasn't overly impressed with Vol.1.  The expectations were so high, and I felt like I got a Three Stooges cartoon.  This one, however, was elevated with the additions of Michael Madsen & David Carradine, and the focus on the relationship between The Bride and Bill.  The training with Pai Mei was great stuff, and the fight scenes were better in this one (the battle between The Bride & Elle Driver is an all-time classic).  Tarantino's obsession with the 70's is getting a little tiring, but it doesn't detract from the great dialogue (Bill's super-hero analogy is great).  After Jackie Brown & Kill Bill-Vol. 1, I just didn't have the enthusiasm for Tarantino like I did after Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs, but it's back now.  And Uma Thurman is outstanding in this.  She should really be in more high-profile roles than what she's getting.",Null,0,1,3 May 2004
Finding Neverland," Liked it
","The big Oscar push has been on for Johnny Depp in Finding Neverland, and while I've seen better male lead performances this year, Depp still gives a fine performance as J.M. Barrie, and the movie itself ends up being very heartwarming. The movie focuses on the inspiration gained by Barrie to write Peter Pan, and a fine ensemble cast led by Kate Winslet helps to show how Barrie gained a family along with a great play, regaining a sense of childhood innocence along the way. Neverland is more closely associated with Michael Jackson these days, and a reference to a similar scandal is hinted at about halfway through the film, but quickly brushed aside. I had a bit of a problem picking up Depp's dialogue at times, he seemed to fall to much into the accent, but it wasn't enough to be a major distraction.",7,1,2,1 January 2005
Monster," Yeah, she's worth the hype
","Charlize Theron gives this year's beautiful-girl-gone-ugly performance made for the Oscar voters, but I think it's the best one by far.  She plays serial killer Aileen Wuornos in a sympathetic light (maybe too sympathetic) and tries to provide an explanation as to why this woman went on the killing spree that she did.  Theron plays the role perfectly, and her face tells the story of why she would have such an extreme hatred for the johns that abused her over the course of her life.  Christina Ricci's character goes from shrinking violet to tough without as much explanation, but it's not a big enough flaw to take away from Theron's performance.",Null,0,0,20 January 2004
Dawn of the Dead," More evidence of horror going back to its roots
","Dawn of the Dead features no survivors, no happy endings, no self-aware dialogue, just straight forward action and horror, and after roughly 8 years of Scream imitations-it's a welcome change. This movie didn't necessarily chill me like George Romero's original Night Of The Living Dead, but that was a bit of a different scenario. Where that one was a few people holed up in a house with dozens of zombies outside, Dawn features an army of hundreds of zombies waiting outside a suburban mall for our dozen or so survivors inside. There are plenty of good old 80's horror movie situations, where you say to yourself 'Why is this idiot doing this?', but director Zack Snyder doesn't let things get too out of hand, and keeps things as realistic as possible. Michael Kelly (CJ) and Ty Burrell (Steve) offer some funny lines, and Mekhi Phifer (Andre) gives a performance that steadily becomes creepier as the movie goes on. Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later have cemented the return of the zombie film after a long absence.",7,0,0,22 January 2005
Lords of Dogtown," Showed a lot of spirit
","Catherine Hardwicke is 2 for 2 thus far in her directorial career, first with Thirteen and now with Lords Of Dogtown, a look at the pioneers of competitive skateboarding. John Robinson, Emile Hirsch, and Victor Rasuk are all strong in their lead roles (although Hirsch is a little too pretty to be a convincing tough guy), and Heath Ledger does a good job portraying burned up leader Skip--a guy who futilely tries to run an emerging cash cow with a stoner's philosophy. All of the actors are impressive skateboarders, and that adds to the raw realism the film conveys. Hardwicke does a good job showing how the sudden fame and fortune ultimately dissolves the friendships.",7,1,15,14 June 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Something for everyone
","(Spoilers) Shaun Of The Dead has romantic comedy, a couple of touching scenes, and some laugh-out loud dialogue provided by Nick Frost as sloppy roommate Ed. And this all happens while killing/escaping zombies! Writer/star Simon Pegg has put together a good bit of familiar elements to make the most original film of 2004. Pegg stars as title character Shaun, a late 20's/early 30's-ish average joe who's happiest just grabbing a pint at the local pub, or playing video games with roommate Ed. He has a beautiful girlfriend and a loving mother, neither of which fit into that equation, and it's obvious that underachieving Shaun needs an occasion to rise to. So why not zombies? Pegg and director Edgar Wright begin the zombie scenario as a joke, but soon the atmosphere turns tense as Shaun & Ed decide to lead their group of survivors to the pub to hole up, and there the movie turns surprisingly VERY tense, while STILL holding on to its wit. The movie is more comedy than horror, to be sure, but you'll be surprised at the chills it provides. Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,4 October 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Great special effects make up for familiar plot lines
","(Spoilers) Tremendous visuals provided in the first half and pretty non-offensive performances make The Day After Tomorrow a good early-summer big screen popcorn treat.  It's barely worth mentioning who stars in this, but we have Dennis Quaid (the comeback kid of the past 5 years) and Jake Gyllenhaal (mopey as ever), with Sela Ward thrown in a little as Dr. Mom, but the real star of the film is the special effects.  Incredible sights to be seen as we get helicopter views of Los Angeles being hit with 5-6 tornadoes at once, and New York City being washed away in a tidal wave.  As the 2nd Ice Age takes over, the movie begins to freeze a little as well, as we get a 1 in a billion rescue mission with the Hall boys (Quaid/Gyllenhall) avoiding ice-breaks, killer CGI wolves, and meanest of all, a gust of wind that'll freeze you solid instantaneously.  I also wish the movie would have dove into the long-term effects of the storm, instead of just focusing on the reaction shots of Vice President Cheney-look alike Becker (Kenneth Walsh) for borderline comedic effect.  Still and all, though, good summer movie.",Null,0,0,2 June 2004
Hotel Rwanda," Parallels Schindler's List
","Don Cheadle gives a great performance as Paul Rusesabagina in Hotel Rwanda, a film that documents the slaughter of a million Rwandans at the hands of their own countrymen. This is almost an African version of Schindler's List, as we witness an unwilling businessman suddenly thrust into the position of savior to a high number of outcasts with nowhere to go. Watching Cheadle's performance is like watching a drowning man try to keep his head above water, and I mean that in a good way--there are situations that look absolutely hopeless for Rusesabagina, but he finds ways to keep people alive at the last second. Nick Nolte gives a good performance as the exasperated Colonel Oliver, a man that is handcuffed with what he can do, but ends up being noble to the end. The scariest role is that of the anonymous radio voice coming over the Rwandan airwaves, encouraging the Hutu natives to wipe out the Tutsi minority. Cheadle is a very good actor, and this is his best role to date.",Null,0,0,19 January 2005
Closer," Good performances from Law & Owen overcome unlikeable characters, story gaps
","A good performance from Jude Law and a great performance from Clive Owen help elevate Mike Nichols' flawed Closer. The story centers around four rather unsavory (but attractive) characters who use and abuse each other unmercifully, but attempt to let each other down as gently as possible. The movie covers about 18 months of this story, but we primarily get the break-up scenes after the relationships of Dan (Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman), and Larry (Owen) and Anna (Julia Roberts) are established. These scenes are pretty intense, and contain language that will probably shake up a good deal of Roberts' loyal audience. These are the scenes that Owen shines in, as he shifts from wounded animal to drunken anger to conniving weasel effortlessly. It wouldn't be out of line to suggest a nomination of some kind for his work here. I had a few cosmetic problems with the film. Portman wears the same hair-do that she had for The Professional, and as a result looks like she's about 16, tops. Her performance is good enough, but I think someone with a few more miles on them, not quite as angelic-looking, could have given the film a little more punch. The half-year gaps in the story didn't help, either, as the attraction Dan & Larry had for Anna was never sufficiently fleshed out for my tastes. Let's be honest, these two don't exactly look like they would have much trouble finding women, and why they chose to fight so vigorously over a cold fish like Anna was a little perplexing. Roberts has the most difficult role to play in the film, as she is basically the prize that Larry and Dan are fighting over, and she serves as sort of a verbal punching bag for Law and Owen to spar with. She does an admirable job, but the two male leads, especially Owen, carry the film.",7,1,1,20 December 2004
Corpse Bride," Different doesn't equal better
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is another attempt at 'adult' animation that falls short. It's a strangely uninvolving little film that features another barrage of unnecessary Hollywood voices, money wasted that could have been spent on better writers--well, it's a Tim Burton movie, so visuals are more the point here. The main character, Victor Van Dort, bears a passing resemblance to Johnny Depp-a little wasted in-joke that goes nowhere. The visuals take you in at some points, but the story itself is so blah that you stop caring about halfway through. Burton was on a 10 year roll through 1999, but the last 6 years have yielded one disappointment after another.",5,3,7,15 October 2005
Cold Mountain," Very Good
","This is, for the most part, a pretty faithful adaptation of Charles Frazier's novel.  Having read the novel a months back, I'm in that difficult position of trying to objectively review a movie that can't capture the detail that the book did.  I could nitpick forever on little things that didn't jibe with the book, but that wouldn't change the fact that this a very entertaining movie, with good performances all around, and great casting on top of that.  I really can't remember a time when a movie cast characters that matched what I had pictured when I read a novel.  Renee Zellweger easily has the most colorful role, but Nicole Kidman & Jude Law (easily one of the best young actors today) are both very good in their roles as Ada & Inman.",Null,0,0,24 January 2004
"I, Robot"," A kinder, gentler version of The Terminator
","Many of the same principles (man vs. unpredictable machine) from The Terminator series is used in I, Robot, so a comparison is inevitable, and I, Robot isn't as hard hitting.  Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan make decent leads; Smith gets his vanity shots in (flexing as he gets out of bed, throwing in some 'aw, hell naw''s along the way) and Moynahan plays the beautiful scientist role that practically any just-over 30 ex-model could have played.  Smith shows more range than normal, though, playing Det. Del Spooner as a guy so obsessed with his job that not much else matters, even though he loves his grandma and watches out for some little street punk (Shia LeBeouf).  The premise is basically the same as The Terminator's, just that in this version, someone smells something wrong before Judgement Day. The head renegade robot sounds like David Hyde Pierce, which is hardly a replacement for Schwarzenegger or even Robert Patrick.",Null,0,0,2 August 2004
Collateral," Pretty familiar, but Cruise's charisma carries
","Another movie featuring a Zen-like hitman spouting off life theories, another Michael Mann movie featuring non-stop aerial city skyline views with a 80's-style guitar solo droning on in the background.  I was practically waiting for Crockett & Tubbs to come save the day, but their suits were already taken by Tom Cruise.  Petty criticisms aside, Tom Cruise once again throws so much charisma into a role that you can't help but enjoy a film based on that fact alone.  Vincent is a character that we've seen before in dozens of films since Quentin Tarrantino fashioned them as just as much talk as action in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but Cruise once again proves himself as one of the most talented actors around by pushing past the familiarities of the script and making the character the driving force behind the film.  The movie itself could have used a little tweaking, especially the way Vincent, a professional assassin, handled certain situations.  I don't see someone who values his own anonymity so much going on a killing spree in a crowded club the way Vincent did.  If you want to see a great movie assassin, check out Assassination Tango with Robert Duvall.",Null,0,0,16 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Long live the Potter series
","J.K. Rowling has creating an amazing universe that Harry Potter and his friends occupy, and I'm fascinated at the way each movie has allowed Harry to grow and mature from childhood to now early teenage years.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson all are outstanding as the leads, with Alan Rickman and David Thewlis providing solid support.  The special effects are once again spectacular, and I feel that CGI has never been put to better use than it has in the Potter series.  I found myself missing Richard Harris, however.  His world-weary hoarseness gave Dumbledore a type of regalness not achieved by replacement Michael Gambon.  That aside, the growth given to the characters whets your appetite for more in the series, and I'm already anxious for the next one.",Null,0,0,25 June 2004
Meet the Fockers," Vastly inferior sequel has a few cute moments
","(Spoiler) Meet The Parents was one of the funniest movies of the decade, as we witnessed put-upon everyman Ben Stiller terrorized by every guy's nightmare, the over-protective father-in-law, ready to believe the worst at all times, played famously by Robert DeNiro. There were a couple of slapstick scenes in the film that I still laugh at after numerous viewings, and much of the interaction rang true between Stiller and DeNiro. Nothing really rings true in Meet The Fockers, as the conflict between Stiller and DeNiro is replaced by Greg Focker's zany parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Hoffman and Streisand play likable enough characters, but don't seem too likely to have raised a kid like Greg. Their over-sexed, ultra-liberal characters are kind of charming, but not really laugh out loud funny. Director Jay Roach then goes for the lowest common denominator--the cute baby. Jack is now overly obsessed with his grandson, and the movie continuously cuts to his reaction shots--he cries when Greg talks to him, he laughs when someone gets kicked in the groin, etc. He also says a profanity for his first word, and repeats it constantly. I found it kind of stupid the first time. You can practically see the kid's mother/father offscreen coaching him through the word. Ben Stiller repeats his Along Came Polly/There's Something About Mary/Meet The Parents persona, but he gets shoved to the background a little in favor of Hoffman and Streisand, and it costs the film big. Sequels are good, even great, when there's more story to tell--but this just solidifies the notion that comedies should just quit while they're ahead.",4,11,21,25 February 2005
Before Sunset," A small masterpiece--OK, just a flat out masterpiece
","(Spoilers) Beautiful European scenery, captivating dialogue, and two great characters help to make Before Sunset an all-time classic in my book.  Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and Richard Linklater have created two extraordinary people with ordinary lives, but their ability to articulate their thoughts and emotions to each other puts them way above any movie couple I have ever seen.  10 years after they parted ways, Jesse (Hawke)and Celine (Delpy) feel each other out and then lay it all on the line after hearing one another's story.  This sequel surpasses the original, as Jesse and Celine have grown up, and now they have grown-up problems to boot, but their connection hasn't gone anywhere.  The open ending was perfect as well.  I hate to think we'll have to wait another 9 years for another sequel, but this story is worth the wait---10/10.",10,2,3,19 July 2004
Hellboy," Uninspired for the most part
","Hellboy kind of sleepwalks through a thousand old comic-book cliches, and doesn't really introduce anything new or refreshing to the genre.  The story skips over 60 years of the title character's life, and makes no effort at all to explain what may have happened in that period to shape a demon into U.S. government agent.  Needless to say, the World War II origin scene was the most inspired, and a better movie may have been lurking in the years that shaped Hellboy, not the end product.  What we are left with is Ron Perlman as a semi-ticked off, cigar chomping brute who non-chalantly dispatches his opponents and shows little to no concern about any danger that awaits him or others.  If you read comics as a kid (or now), you know this covers roughly a quarter of the Marvel roster. Hellboy's cohorts are nothing special either, Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) is almost a direct knock-off of Charlie McGee in Firestarter (we get no background on their romance), and John Myers (Rupert Evans) just sort of reacts to his partner's destructive tendencies.  The only interesting characters to me were Professor Broom (John Hurt) as Hellboy's 'father', and undead Nazi assassin Kroenen (Karel Roden).  The action scenes were pretty standard, typical CGI stuff.  I did like the fact that an actor portrayed Hellboy, and he wasn't computer-generated.  That makes the movie much more watchable.  Just don't be surprised if you've completely forgotten about this movie 2 hours after you've left the theatre.",Null,1,3,19 April 2004
The Incredibles," It's incredible, all right
","Pixar reaches new heights with The Incredibles, which covers the exploits of a superhero brought out of forced retirement, with his family along to boot.The action scenes are absolutely amazing, especially the scenes involving Dash running from Syndrome's minions--it recalls and actually surpasses the forest scenes from Return Of The Jedi. The scenes where Violet & Dash discover how to harness their powers while running for their lives are very thrilling as well. The voice work is nicely done, and doesn't include the show-offy mega-star stuff that's bringing some of these big animated films down a little (Sarah Vowell is the standout as junior-high age Violet Parr).The humor is a little more restrained than usual for these Pixar films (Toy Story & Finding Nemo provided more laughter), but the action scenes put this one on a pedestal all its own.",Null,0,1,11 December 2004
Dog Day Afternoon," Pretty good hostage movie
","Al Pacino and Charles Durning are the highlights of Dog Day Afternoon, a thriller concerning a pair of none-too-bright bank robbers and the hostage situation they find themselves thrown into.  John Cazale is also effective as dim but dangerous Sal, a guy who doesn't know that Wyoming is just a state, but seems capable of murdering his hostages with no trace of emotion. When he says he's prepared to send out bodies, I had a feeling he meant it. Some of the shouting-match negotiations between Sonny (Pacino) and Detective Moretti (Durning) are really funny.  While I thought it was pretty solid, I don't rate it as an all-time classic like others seem to.  With the exception of the last 12 minutes, there was a lack of intensity that I felt was needed for this type of movie.  Pacino seemed almost TOO gentlemanly toward his hostages, and it costs the atmosphere.",Null,0,3,30 May 2004
Hero," Intriguing story, lush scenery, but fight scenes detract
","Hero tells a very good story, and I felt myself taken in by it, but the movie could have been better in my opinion if the ballet-like fight scenes had been toned down a bit. When two warriors who are supposed to be battling are instead dancing around Broadway-style on a lake (albeit a very beautiful lake), the tension and impact are somewhat lost. Jet Li shows as much range and emotion as usual (none), but you don't doubt for a second that he is as deadly an assassin as could be found at that time. Daoming Chin is also effective as the king of Qin, as is Maggie Cheung as Flying Snow. The acting is there for each scene, but the visuals, while breathtaking at times, become over-the-top more than once. The fight scene between Flying Snow and Moon (Ziyi Zhang) could have been powerful if had been shot Kill Bill: Volume 2 style, but director Yimou Zhang instead bombards us with so many falling leaves that you can hardly tell what's going on. I know, I know, this is the way these movies are shot, but it's frustrating when you become involved in a gripping story and then are given 2 warriors fighting off thousands of soldiers by spinning around in circles.",Null,0,0,5 September 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Really good sports movie
","Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank are both excellent (and deserving of their Oscar nominations) in Million Dollar Baby, a great sports movie that will be mentioned for decades to come when sportswriters make their annual lists of the best movies to see. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a boxing trainer who doesn't like taking chances until he hooks up with Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) an untrained waitress with a killer punch. Morgan Freeman, to a certain extent, reprises his role in The Shawshank Redemption by narrating the movie in a letter written to Dunn's daughter. Freeman is such a natural at this, however, that it enhances this film just as much as it did Shawshank. I guess once a decade isn't overkill. Eastwood directs a movie that looks to be going in a much different direction that it ends up going in, as excruciating decisions are left to be made by Frankie after an injury leaves Maggie paralyzed. Where I thought we were about to see Rocky VI, Million Dollar Baby becomes a throat-catcher in its third act, as we see classic tough-guy Eastwood ripped to shreds by his surrogate daughter. This scenario has been played before, but Eastwood and Swank put a whole new touch to it, and it turns Million Dollar Baby into one of the best of 2004.",Null,0,1,31 January 2005
Shrek 2," Not as good as the first, but still good
","(Some spoilers) Shrek 2 centers around our green-skinned hero continuing his quest for acceptance, against his better instincts.  Another top-notch computer animation effort, with great visuals top to bottom.  Both Shreks demand second viewings to catch background detail that slip by as you try to follow the story the first go-round.  The character of Shrek is a bit less ogre-ish this time around, and that puts the film behind the original, as we depend on the supporting cast a little more.  The funniest scene involves an assassination attempt on Shrek by Puss In Boots (Antonio Bandaras), with all feline advantages and disadvantages being exposed during the battle.  The songs, as in the original, are outstandingly non-cartoonish.",Null,0,0,7 June 2004
Big Fish," OK, kind of forgettable
","(Some spoilers ahead) Tim Burton goes about as mainstream as he possibly can for Big Fish, but the results did not wow me as much as it has others.  Ewan McGregor & Albert Finney share duties as Ed Bloom, who (allegedly) lived a life of tall tales that bring a smile to everyone who hears them, with the exception of Ed's son, Will (Billy Crudup), who is so fed up with them that he ices the old man out for 3 years.  While I found Will's reaction a bit extreme, I could empathize with his plight.  Finney plays the type of long winded blowhard that only gathers a crowd in the movies.  In real life, people see this cat coming, they go in the other direction.  Jessica Lange is utterly wasted & given nothing at all to do, period, except smile at Finney & take a fully clothed bath with him.  McGregor, as usual, is charming to the nth degree & carries every scene he's in.  But the tall tales themselves are just no big deal, and I didn't find myself getting involved in any of them.  When death finally comes to Finney's Ed, I saw 4 grown men sitting around me crying like babies.  I didn't feel anything for this guy, so I just had some more popcorn.",Null,0,1,9 February 2004
The Last Samurai," Good battle scenes, a little melodramatic
","Ken Watanabe shines as Katsumoto in The Last Samurai, a wannabe epic that falls short of those expectations, but is still entertaining.  Tom Cruise's character, Captain Nathan Algren, begins the movie slaughtering dozens of samurai singlehandedly, then can't beat one in a stick fight, then after months of training, is presented once again as a one-man army, capable of taking down a half-dozen ninjas with nothing more than a smoking jacket and a far-away look.  Cruise's character is left with a few holes, such as why he hates Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) so much, and is also left with a half-realized romance that never has any payoff.  Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto, as his lead samurai rings with authenticity.  The first & final battle scenes are first-rate, while I would not put them on the level of Braveheart, Glory, or Ran, I still think they're outstanding.",Null,0,1,18 June 2004
Three Colors: Blue," Starts off well, but builds to nothing special
","(Spoilers) Juliette Binoche stars as Julie Vignon, a woman in serious need of grief counseling, in Blue, the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's colors trilogy.  The entire time I watched this, the thought kept rolling through my head: 'This woman needs to see someone'.  But that notwithstanding, Blue took me in early and then lost me toward the end.  The movie plays a series of events in the life of a woman who wants to completely start over after losing her husband and daughter.  Several oddballs come and go into her life, all the while kept at a cold distance by Binoche's Julie.  In the beginning, I felt sympathy for Julie (who wouldn't?), but as the film wore on, the lead character's distant emotions began to wear me down, and I lost interest.  The little surprises we learn toward the end didn't do too much for me, as Julie seems no better or worse than she did in the beginning. I'll mark this 'overrated'.",Null,2,5,7 May 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Too many stupid moments to make it recommendable
","(Spoilers) Anyone who watches Saturday Night Live knows that when Will Ferrell donned a mustache, his voice would drop an octave lower and he would put on an ultra cheesy/70's porn star/Malboro Man type of persona that was often hilarious.  Stick in a 5 minute sketch and it's gold, but stretch it over 90 minutes, and you're going to have big gaps of non-laughter, and Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy has too many.  It's the same old trap the ex-SNLer's keep falling into.  There are plenty of chuckle-worthy moments, but there's no real gut-buster bit here--and this movie is really nothing more than a series of bits.  Ferrell offers no surprises as Burgundy, like I said, if you've watched SNL, you know what this guy is going to say sometimes before he says it.  Steve Carell steals most of the laughs as deranged weatherman Brick Tamland, but his character is mostly hit-and-miss as well.  There's also an endless series of cameos (we're talking every other scene) by the same 3 or 4 guys who seem to adore sharing screen time with each other (Stiller, Vaughn, one of the Wilson brothers). Do yourself a favor and just rent SNL: The Best Of Will Ferrell instead.",Null,1,1,26 July 2004
Ray," Outstanding biography on Ray Charles
","Jamie Foxx earns an Oscar in Ray, an all-around tremendous film documenting the life of the legendary Ray Charles. Foxx has every one of Charles' mannerisms down to a 'T', and successfully portrays a flawed musical genius that makes no apologies for the tough business/personal decisions that he made to get to the top. Director Taylor Hackford does a great job showing Charles with warts and all, as we see Charles cheat on his wife and various mistresses, and dump old friends with no looking back. The real strength of the movie (beyond Foxx's performance) is the perfect balance between Charles's personal battles and the versatile music career he excelled at. We get a nice insight into how some of Charles's biggest hits came about--the show stopping 'What I'd Say' performance is incredible. Regina King is very good as Margie Hendricks, the Raylette that serves as Ray's wife on the road. Sharon Warren may have been overlooked by the Oscar people for her strong performance as Ray's mother. But Foxx owns this picture, and it would be highway robbery if the definitive performance of the year were passed over.",9,0,1,11 February 2005
The Terminal," Way too cutesy
","(Some spoilers) I can't remember the last time I rolled my eyes more watching a movie than I did watching The Terminal, basically a 21st century remake of the 1981 Gary Coleman masterpiece, On The Right Track.  We are to believe that not speaking English gives Victor Navorski a childlike innocence/perfection that surpasses all other fish-out-of-water characters, save the incomparable E.T.  Hanks leads a nauseatingly saccharine group, that includes, most offensively, Catherine Zeta-Jones as slutty flight attendant Amelia Warren, and Kumar Pallana as Gupta Rajan, the Indian janitor with the endless one-liners.  Gupta's idea of fun is to wet the floor then sit two feet away and laugh loudly as people slide and break bones.  His character is boorish and stupid almost to the point of offensiveness.  Zeta-Jones does nothing for the good name of flight attendants world-wide, as she alternates between sleeping with married men and trying to pick up Victor every time she comes in contact with him.  Her character is really left out in the lurch as the movie ends, as she seems to be in the same rut as when we first met her.  Hanks' character, of course, goes from total outcast to having every last man, woman, and teenager working at the airport gazing upon him with complete rapture.  There are numerous silly subplots, including a completely unbelieveable Star Trek type romance, and we are led to believe that no one working at the airport has any friends, family, life, etc. outside of the walls.  They're basically in Victor's shoes as well.  Sounds unbelieveable?  Spielberg didn't think so.",Null,0,1,6 July 2004
Cinderella Man," Great fight scenes, too many sappy moments
","Renee Zellweger almost succeeds in ruining Cinderella Man, the Ron Howardization of former heavyweight champion James J. Braddock's life. Russell Crowe gives a solid performance as the champ, but the script left no room for any blemish on Braddock's character, and the Irish saint thing really begins to wear thin by the third act, as Braddock is practically deified by his adoring Depression-era public. Zellwegger is the worst of the lot, sapping up each scene she's in as Braddock begins his comeback. It seems in the beginning of the film that she has no problem with Braddock's career, but turns on a dime when Jim announces his return to the ring. All the schmaltz aside though, the fight scenes themselves are fantastic. You can tell that Howard really did his homework on the old fight films and got everything down right. These scenes are the soul of the film, but I didn't get any Rocky-like chills due to the pandering nature of the film to tug at your heart strings.",6,2,5,6 June 2005
