The New World," Amazing way of expressing the creation of the so called 'New World' and 'new World Order'
","Those who expected to watch a typical American movie may have been disappointed. This was not a film of showing history from only a war point of view such as pure fighting and war scenes.The film has a very smooth flow and expressed the views in a rather intellectual way. people must take a close look at the personalities of the two main characters in the film.i would have to say that its one of the most impressive love movies made as well. The acting is breathtaking, especially of the indigenous girl. They managed to reflect the feelings and the way of living at the time very well. Also the main character of the 'New World' in comparison to the Red Indian also tries in an indirect way to show the differences between the systems, way of thinking and societies. There is no doubt that Red Indians must have liked the film more than the new owners of the USA as well as people who were expecting a typical American movie. I suppose this was the only non-typical American movie having the word' America' in its name.",10,3,7,7 March 2006
