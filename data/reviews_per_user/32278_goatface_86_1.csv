Marie Antoinette," best movie
","I saw this movie in Paris, France on the Champs Elysees in July. It was perfect. We went to see Versailles the day before. I have since read biographies and done other research on MA and the French Revolution. I am obsessed and this movie is so fun. The music is perfect. It is pretty accurate too. Enjoy it for what it is. The actors/actresses were great and it is a feast for the senses. The costuming is superb. I think that it gives a somewhat fair look of the views about the queen. She was inexperienced and young and was ignorant about the condition of the people of France. She never her whole life saw the ocean. As for the rest of the story there is so much more to tell. After leaving Versialles there were years of imprisonment and depressing events. I like that Sophia decided to end the movie when she did. The movie would have to be MUCH longer in order to tell the whole story. Overall I think this movie is a must see and can't wait to see it again. I'm also looking forward to bonus features on the DVD.",10,3,8,3 October 2006
