Deja Vu," Brilliant work of art
",This movie really played with my head the way that I had to pause it at least 5 times!! Dude my head couldn't bare this making the impossible true thing.you know I think the movie was made the way that the audience would really tries to make a sense out of its Complexity with out a doubt despite having 1000s of question colliding to gather inside his mind!!!! ÔÅä) You watch the movie you get nuts and the more you get confused the more you want to follow and you want to believe it as a possibility and that makes it more attractive. Beside I admit that Denzel played a Denzel thing this role was meant to assigned to him. Those who has the Donnie Darko as their first movie would shift that in the 2nd rank.

Hot Fuzz," Gr8 Movie
",Another masterpiece by Mr.Edgar Wright . The movie can not be categorized under any genre this is undoubtedly the mixture of feelings which makes you laugh hard and on the other hand scares the heck out of you meanwhile your romantic senses are tearing your heart out this movie is really something. While it takes you in very normal and calm village with normal people trying to convince the audience as if they are innocent and kind suddenly the movie changes the phase somehow that you can not believe it . I believe it is a work of art when a movie can make you laugh love and scared at the same time which is incredible. I'd really suggest this one to every one. Regards Vahid,9,1,3,18 November 2007
