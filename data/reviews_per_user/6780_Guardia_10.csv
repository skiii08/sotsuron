The Incredible Hulk," Incredible. As In 'Not Credible'.
","This rendition of the Hulk story sees Edward Norton as 'Bruce Banner'. He is a man in hiding in South America, living an anonymous life as a factory worker. Why? Well, the government (or rather a particular Army General) want to find him at any cost. Really, what we're looking at in this film, is the story of a victim. Banner was created by the government, and now, the government want him for their own ends. It's a little of the Frankenstein-complex yet again in American cinema, (see 'Robocop', 'Universal Soldier' for other takes on this premise.) It begins, and rather than sit through twenty-minutes plus of back-story, the decision was made to show all relevant explanatory scenes in an opening montage sequence. These scenes (although quite clumsy in their direction) were an inclusion I was grateful for. I thought this would help the film find some momentum. But, I was only half-right. We skip ahead to Bruce's anonymous existence in Brazil, and we are itching to see signs of the hulk within him. Only hints in some of his unusual behaviour would ever suggest that he has any more than an anti-social problem.When a clash between the government forces finally erupts, it is fairly underwhelming; a competently shot chase-scene plays out (Edward Norton runs like a girl!) and a poor 'fight' scene to conclude it. When the animal of the title is finally revealed, it is a shadowy, confusing environment, and we only see a glimpse. Here, the direction delays the unveiling of it's draw-card as long as it can. Also, like so many movies of late, I found myself enjoying the scenery more than the performances - Brazil has never looked like more colourful and fascinating in it's maze of slums and shanty-towns.Banner's nemesis 'General Ross', uses 'Blonksy' as his right-hand man. This role (play by Tim Roth) starts well enough (the David vs. Goliath notion is a nice touch), then gets a little over-the-top, then hits the outright ludicrous. He seems to have a major grudge over a special operation in Brazil that doesn't go his way. Just WHY this is such a problem for this guy is never made clear - he takes 'failure' (although he has several other attempts at the same mission) way too personally for a spec-ops soldier. This brooding resentment is amplified by General Ross' tampering, and we are promised a showdown between two Goliaths.The problem this films has is that it tries to make an underdog out of a superior character. A victim, a persecuted monster, the hulk is meant to draw sympathy AND be the unbeatable character. Sure, he takes his hits, but you're never worried that he won't succeed. The only way this film can raise the stakes is from turning things up from ten to eleven on the dial. And I'm not convinced that going to eleven makes the viewing experience that much better - rather, it overshadows everything else you've just sat through and invested in.The climax, although well done in isolation, is ridiculous in it's seriousness. The love interest is just an excuse to give Bruce someone to talk to - to explain his Jekyll and Hyde complex, (one scene in a cave is particularly stupid. Watch the continuously changing size of his body). The father/daughter relationship has a particularly bitter taste to it, and Roth's evolving psychosis happens much too suddenly - we see HIS transformation as a despicable 'abomination', but is it really that different from Banner's? Why is one worthy of sympathy, when another is demon that should be exterminated? Because it's 'uglier'?Comic book to film movies are never going to work for me in this format. Imposing the super-human character over today's society will always come across awkwardly for me. They seem to want it both ways: an unstoppable physical giant, worthy of the armed-forces complete attention, and an anonymous weak-bodied victim, who is cursed with the power others will kill for. This contrast, although interesting on paper, is increasingly hard to convey believably.",5,9,22,12 June 2008
Battleship Potemkin," Men or 'Maggots'...
","It was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch. The economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this.The film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with - you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens. Of course, this film has it's own agenda, but as it is a practically redundant cause, it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense.The tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving onto the mainland. Things escalate believably and for a film of it's era, it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film.This really is worth sitting through, (that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins).",8,1,2,6 May 2006
Full Metal Jacket," 'In Vietnam, the film doesn't suck...'
","An excellent film concerning war as a phenomenon in it's own right. What is so good about this film is that it makes no statement about war, it just presents it to you. Here we have Kubrick completely ignoring generic and traditional dramatic structure, as he sticks his neck out yet again to present one of the most uncompromising dramatic forms ever shot. It is brilliant.We follow 'Joker' (Matthew Modine) throughout the course of the movie, starting at boot camp and moving into Vietnam itself. We are not given any inside information in the film - we know and understand less than the characters themselves. All we know is, through the claustrophobia of the training barracks, that there is a war out there somewhere and that these soldiers will fight against something. Even the narration (provided by Modine) is empty and robotic, unlike the journal-esqu readings of 'Platoon'.We see their meaningless and detached involvements, and can not help but feel shut-out from even the most basic elements of the entire Vietnam conflict. All actions are amplified as we are so close in (yet paradoxically, so removed) to the platoon/squad that the big picture and any perspective is completely distorted and even lost. The enemy is portrayed as invisible, un-killable and even mythical - and when they are revealed at close-quarters, the futility and lawlessness of war and human behaviour is hammered home. Multiple viewings are highly recommended, however not necessary.",9,0,0,28 July 2005
The Aviator," The Nauseator
","What they did with this film was organise every little last detail FIRST. Then, when they had all the little DETAILS perfect, they tried to film them with actors in COSTUMES that were SO accurate....Why not focus on something thats worth filming, develop the screenplay RESPONSIBLY, and then hire any ass-head actor to play the part. THEN the film would be coming from the right end to begin with.This film from this particular director makes me think of those novels where an elderly and distinguished author teams up with young hot-shot but does not actually input anything substantial or significant.I got the feeling Scorcese was almost the Exec. Producer more than a director.The best compliment I can give this was that it was beautifully COMPETENT, and that is all.",4,5,9,13 February 2005
Alien vs. Predator," What just happened here?
",Plot: Simultaneously complicated in the wrong areas and simplified in others. Half-hearted attempts to add depth. Ideas are either not explained or abandoned.Music: Pedestrian and a poor simulation as if they could not get the rights for the music from Predator 1/2.Performances: Too much work goes into establishing boring characters only to have them killed by the way. They are not worth the audiences' investment.Originality: Very. I've never seen a movie this confusing. Why would they try to deliberately confuse the audience. I think I know why...CGI: Standard.,2,0,1,6 October 2004
Saw II," I 'Saw' it 'two'.
","This is an immature and decidedly teenage thriller movie. Unfortunately, the violence in this movie gets in the way of the potential horror of the script. The premise contains enough material to construct a half-way decent horror film, (as did the very similar 'Cube'), however, it cannot resist temptation, and indulges itself continuously with low-end graphic-novel style violence.Sure, the odd hack/stab/bullet/club is effective, but, with so many identical and self-referential films in this failing genre, each action halves the effect of the next. What impact does the first bullet have, say, after watching 60+mins of additional violence? Very little. It is it's own worst enemy.By the way, notice how for the length of the entire movie the swirling, 'tortured', rubbishy atmospheric soundtrack? This just further undermines any potential long-term horror as it consistently blending every scene into the next - every scene is equal. I've never seen a movie with so much violence and gore lack so much power.Thankfully the cinema I went to shows these films at a reduced price, so I'm too upset about this hunk of trash. Not scary, not suspenseful, not funny, not reasonable, but (thank God) not too long.",2,4,9,19 November 2005
Thor," Not Quite What I THORt
","'Thor' makes an excellent start as pseudo-historical action adventure, but its misguided focus on redundant elements within the script mean that the film falls short of the promise it makes early on. We begin at Asgard: it is portrayed artistically, magically, and convincingly - a golden, sacred, Romanesque kingdom ruled by the father-figure of the film: Odin.Sir A. Hopkins plays this character spot-on; he expresses wrath, pathos and vulnerability interchangeably. Under-used throughout the script, he is given only a moderate chance to flex his divine will and power, and he is put away fairly annoyingly to make way for the less convincing and single-sided character of Loki (portrayed unevenly by T. Hiddleston).Like all modern comic-to-film adventures, the fish-out-of-water mechanism is employed in what seems to be an ever shortening delay from the film's outset. Read: Thor is banished to Earth. Here he we see a cast of supporting players (N. Portman et al) who give Thor the vast majority of his admittedly explanatory dialog. There are a few tries at comic relief here (just how *would* a man-god react to a modern hospital, restaurant and so on...?), but they are fleeting.Action sequences are just as sparse, and even more baffling is that they are really rather small-scale. Lack of scope is what the film suffers from - and what seemed like the beginning of the end sequence was revealed to be *the* end sequence. Choreography is mixed too; there are some satisfying big hits, but they have to make their way through scrambling, scuffling brawls. Thor's most interesting enemy is dispatched late in the film, but this sequence seems to have arrived too late to have any sway on the plot for this viewer.3D effects are well executed, and the typical cheap shots of pointy things for the sake of pointy things is tastefully avoided. When it *does* happen, it is with purpose and sound timing. Visuals are smartly married to excellent sound design, the technical aspects are what carry this film through its slumbering second-reel.Cinematography is victim to repeated tilting of the frame. There is hardly a square shot in the film, and all mid-to-close shots are tilted up to 45-degrees or less. Even establishing shots are annoyingly angled, disfiguring the space of the sets and disorientating the viewer from the physicality of the character movements and local spaces of scenes.Performances are apt all round - it is a testament to the performers to see them break through some of the stilted characterizations. Thor himself is well played, though most of the performance is carried by physical presence, not emotive expression or dialog. His goofy costume is accurate but plasticy, his comrades literally look like sci-fi convention-goers. I exaggerate not.The film is worthwhile overall, but suffers from a small-minded script. At least Odin, blessed with divine knowledge, managed to take a nap through the dullest areas of the film. For this, I envied the Gods.",6,1,4,11 May 2011
Downfall," Yes, it's good.
","Very well-crafted film about the final Nazi involvement(s) of World War II. The viewer is taken (unflinchingly) behind the scenes of the Nazi administration.The film moves over all the major developments of the fall of Hitler. This is a triumph of scripting and editing from the production team, as it covers a lot of ground without rushing, and also without compromising dramatic structure.The film's attention to detail is excellent, as is it's clever cross-section of the War's effect on different protagonists - from a civilian boy to Hitler himself.Never boring, not going for cheap shots, and excellently filmed, this is the most competent take on WWII I have ever seen.",8,1,3,7 May 2005
Jaws," The 3 'R's' - Roy, Robert and Richard.
","Although it misrepresents true shark behavior, this film is pretty entertaining. The dramatic elements are off-set well with the action sequences, and the overall structure of the film is nicely balanced (even though it is quite long).Robert Shaw is probably the highlight character, and Roy Scheider is pretty good as Chief Brody. Richard Dreyfuss is just as good as Hooper, who is the 'rational' voice of the film, (opposing Quint's recklessness). The scene where Hooper tires to prove his way onto the 'Orca's' crew is worth the sitting alone - it is ridiculously hilarious.Spielberg used his resources effectively, and there are no real cop-out scenes or short-cuts taken within the story. The real threat of the shark becomes apparent suitably, and you suddenly feel as if there is real danger for the crew, however see-through the dramatic devices/special effects are.This film is too legendary for me to add anything more - it is general knowledge that it is (or should be) the definitive modern (Moby Dick) adventure story.(Question: When Brody cannot close the beaches because of the Mayor, why doesn't he just go over his head to the next level of Government?)",9,3,7,15 April 2005
The Birds," I'm not (Gull)ible
","This film is mainly a drawn-out drama. It deals with two main protagonists who meet by chance but then swiftly become the love interests.Exactly why there is a developing bird onslaught is really second to the physical events themselves, and how the main characters deal with the attack, (in their own unquestioning fashion). Sure, there are some crackpot theorists in the diner, (as well as an unconvincable ornithologist, who in my view should have been the FIRST to notice any unusual bird behavior, not the last), but nobody really helps the viewer out.There are some good moments too. The first hints of unusual avian behavior are curious and quite unexpected. Also, the feeling of seclusion and isolation in Bodego Bay are sufficient and quite appropriate, even if standard film-making techniques.You get the feeling that this story is a complete dramatic cul-de-sac. Any meaning or grand scheme behind the 'climax' of the film would only invalidate almost everything else that happened previously. I for one cannot think of any explanation(s) that would not make me regret the two-hour sitting. Can you?",6,4,6,18 May 2005
