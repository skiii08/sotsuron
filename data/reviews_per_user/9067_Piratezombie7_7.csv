Casablanca," best movie ever
","How many times have you heard a line from Casablanca in some other TV show or movie? I hear them all the time and there is a reason for that, this movie is one of the most famous and best movies of all time. The story line of the movie is griping no matter how many times you see it. I don't know the perspective of the people who saw the movie when it came out but for me anything with Nazi's getting their asses handed to them makes any movie awesome. The acting by Bogart is what I would say is the end all be all devil may care guy. Of course all the actors do exceptionally in this movie which really ties the movie together with the seriousness of everything sprinkled with humorous quips made by Bogart to loosen the tension.",Null,0,2,17 October 2011
Taxi Driver," Bang Bang, two in the head
","Taxi driver, to say the least, is one of the most extreme movies of all time. I saw this film when I was pretty young and I swear it made me afraid of Vets for the longest time. The movie dose however hold a place in my heart as a tale of a lost man. De Niro plays the character so well in every way. Hes a wanderer who slinks around the cities underbelly observing but not participating. It's strange to see a character surrounded by filth but not indulging in it, the director must have been a genius to have De Niro act the way he dose like hes moving with out purpose until he meets the prostitute at which time it seems the cinematographer chose to darken the movie to make it a little more suspenseful.",9,0,0,15 December 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Surprisingly wasn't entertained
","I know this movie is supposed to be one of the greatest movies of all time, and be timeless, but I just don't feel it. I will admit the acting is superb on all fronts, especially Tom Jode who's performance could bring a more sentimental man to tears. I feel horrible in saying this but I really was almost annoyed by the complaining and sunken in feeling through out the movie, very depressing. It may just be my mood at the time but I can't seem to get behind the cause of the characters no matter what. I wish I could but I guess the wealth of other great emotion films out there have made me numb to a person who isn't real, who never faced the problems in the movie.",Null,0,0,11 October 2011
The Exorcist," Apparently your mother isn't doing well in hell
","To say that the exorcist pushed the envelop when it come to horror movies would be an understatement. Nowadays you get horror films that try to stock up on gore to freak people out but the exorcist is classic for being one of the scariest movies I can think of without having any gore in it to gimmick people into being scared. This movie is so excellent that the scene were her head spins around actually kept me awake for many a night as a child. Taking on the issue of religion and exorcism was quite the endeavor and because of its success it set the stage for the creation of the exorcism sub-genre in the horror genre.The only movie I have seen that even stands close to the excellence of this movie would be last years The Rite with Anthony Hopkins. If you like this movie then see that one, and if you liked that one see this one.",9,1,2,15 December 2011
The Graduate," Heres to you Mr.s Robinson
",The Graduate came out in 1967 during the time of New Hollywood were all kinds of new subjects were used as film base. In this one the movie tackles the controversial topic of adultery. Dustin Hoffman's character Ben getting involved with a married women was something that up until the ending of the Hay code could not be talked about. The movie really tested what people could allow in a film and did it in a way that opened up many peoples minds to the use of film as a way to discus sensitive topics. Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Ben is much weaker then the character in the book but his shyness is actual quite interesting and works in a way that makes you almost feel for him.,8,2,2,15 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," who doesn't love singing?
","Who doesn't love singing, nobody, that's who. This is a movie that you can really smile to. I love this movie mainly because even when something horrible happens it is quickly resolved and leaves the viewer feeling content. So about the music, its phenomenal, every song is either extremely uplifting or seriously thought provoking. My personal favorite is 'Make 'em laugh' even though its not the main character its still the best and funniest number in the movie. I love when the curtain is pulled back at the end and all is revealed, it gives you such a good feeling to know the bad guy gets what she deserves in the end. I originally saw this movie when I was quite little but even today its still in my top ten.",Null,0,2,16 November 2011
Psycho," Hitchcock knows best
",Growing up I knew Psycho references way before I had even seen the movie. The infamy which this movie has earned is totally understandable because of how awesome it is. The storyline is one of my favorite of all suspense movies. Even though there is a lack of violence and gore in the movie it still acts as one of the best horror/suspense movie to date. The acting by the lead man is what i often reference if I am looking for a creepy model to base my acting off of. Hitchcock used a lack of gimmicks and effects in all of his movies but in Psycho the simplicity really adds to the creepiness and really makes for a great movie. Over all this is one of the best movies of all time and should be seen by all people who enjoy classic movies.,10,0,0,14 December 2011
