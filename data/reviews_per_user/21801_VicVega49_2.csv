Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Not to be rude but
","Nice source and usage of animation and action. The actors/ actresses were all good at their role. But the one thing that I noticed was the music. Not to be rude but Alan Silvestri really needs to work on that music. It is too much like an echo! Come on! This does sound stupid, does it? Well anyway, for anyone who wants to see this movie or it just catches their mind, I recommend that you give it a shot. because i sure as heck did, and it was the best movie that I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!! Except for the music. Still the music is not that bad. But if I were you, Watch the movie!!!!",10,0,0,7 March 2006
X-Men," A well thought out and organized movie
","A all around awesome movie, but perhaps could have had a little bit more action. The story line is also a little , as I should say, simple. But the movie itself kicks behind! Some of the actors including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian Mckellan, did a terrific job as their character.It had a whole lot of action, and kept sort of close to the comics. Singer did a fine job, as he may continue in the future. This movie should make fans of X-men proud, and carry on with their assortment of likings to it.Everything about this movie is very well thought out, along with being organized. The music i must say though might need a little working on, but the movie still rocks. I enjoyed it very much, and hope singer can make another good movie soon. Well done Singer!",9,0,0,26 May 2006
