Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I Enjoy this and thats all that matters
","I don't really understand why people dislike Episode I so much. I truly enjoyed this film in the theatres and bought the excellent DVD because of it. I think the movie was just about on par as the other films and was entertaining its own way. Some people claim that its not original or lacks of creativity, which is way off base. Its a Star Wars film so it has to borrow elements fromt the original films to make sense. It wouldn't be a particular interesting film if it was about slave life on Tatooine or the political underpinnings of the Republic Senate. It has to have certain elements from the original films to be a fun film which this film basically was. Granted the plot was a bit complicated and at times convoluted and there was scenes that seemed to drag(the dinner scene, the Anakin-Qui-Gon Stuf, etc.) but on the whole it was generally entertaining. I give this film a 9 out of 10.",10,29,43,18 November 2001
