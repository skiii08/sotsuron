Sucker Punch," Awesome animation
","Awesome animation. Yes.I love Sucker Punch, it's very entertaining. The graphic's so nice I can't wait to see the other scenes over and over. And I love how the baby doll jumped and held the sword like a pro. Too bad I didn't watch this movie when it first released. But there was HBO, airing Sucker Punch and then I fell in love.I'm a little confused to know that Sucker Punch, perhaps, in fact, doesn't get a worth feedback from the world. It has a great story, well let's call it as not-so-bad. And the animation is great too. So what's the matter? I think this movie is underrated. I like Sucker Punch better than Chronicle.",9,4,8,6 April 2014
