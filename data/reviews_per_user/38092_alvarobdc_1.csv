It," are It ratings as inflated as the 'famous' red balloons?
","To be fair, this It (2017) remake is better than the original one (1990), I think there is no doubt here. It is also an entertaining movie, so you can spend your money on watching it in movie theaters, it is OK.But being critic, I will call this film 'clichIt', for obvious reasons. Creating a scary atmosphere is hard, but that does not mean that you have to turn everything into the 'scarier version' of it, f.e. ruined house with scratchy doors, things that move themselves for no reason, etc., it really is a large list of 'scary items' that are too used in this movie.When I watched the movie, I had a good time, but I was not scared at all, maybe some Pennywhise appearances in screen made me fright. But this movie made me laugh more than scare, mainly thanks to Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard) jokes.An horror movie that makes you laugh more than panic? Not what I expected for sure.",7,1,7,13 September 2017
