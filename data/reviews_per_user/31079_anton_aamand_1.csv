The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Boring, boring movie
","The 2 first movies of hunger games were awesome. But this 3 movie was really boring. A movie made for money purpose I think. There was no action like the 2 first movies, and the history of the movie was really simple and boring. The acting was good though, but its not enough.A movie for me is good when I get inter tainted. By that I don't mean only laughing, but a range of all the emotions.I give it 3 out of 10 stars.I gave number 1 7 stars and number 2, 8 stars.I think some people like it because they have read the book, and therefore can relate to it.",3,56,99,18 November 2014
