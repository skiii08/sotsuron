Come and See," The horror
","It is a movie not for the faint hearted. It broke more times, than any other movie I've ever seen. It's absolutely shocking and hard to watch. You will be not prepared for the horror of war, you are about to witness. But you will probably leave with much more, then you've had before, so it's absolutely a must-watch. Hands down the most realistic depiction of the atrocities ever commited in any war.",10,1,4,21 February 2020
