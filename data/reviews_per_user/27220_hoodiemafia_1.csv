The Ring," Really good experience for the horror genre
",Not a conventional jump and got em horror movie and also an adaptation of its Japanese sister film.a movie for people who are genuinely interested in watching rather than just throwing it on.it has enough horror elements to keep you on edge while also interested in the mystery.alot of people are turned off by the ending but we are used to American horror films that have a clear an concise resolution not a Japanese rouge ending.very solid from beginning to end.ps. the movie is very clear cut and precise but can move a little bit fast...dont be afraid to google if you get confused,9,0,1,11 March 2020
