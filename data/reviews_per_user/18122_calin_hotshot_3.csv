Ford v Ferrari," A goofy attempt
","I actually was pretty excited to see this movie. As an athlete myself I must say I usually don't agree with the hollywoodization of sports in general, but with Mangold at the helm and two of the best actors in the business as the main characters I got pretty optimistic.
Needless to say, all three mentioned above do their best, but the writting behind this movie is laughable at best. It tries really hard to be profound, with characters just charghing wrecklesly through the streets to show how pissed of they are, but it never really gets to the level of sentiment you would expect from and oscar nominated movie. I honestly don't know what got that nomination besides the shameless pro-american message.
Ford v Ferrari, which is not even the main thing about this movie, could be easily described like this: take a race car driver and put him in a movie that's not even about racing (it's unlikely it'll be any good). That's about the jist of it, just the other way round.
If you want to make a movie about a sport, just call someone who actually knows that field and listen to them. Sad to say, probably without his fault since it's a nicely passed, good looking movie, this is one of Mangold's misses.
Props to Bale for another great performance. Damon was fine, I guess. Also the movie is way too long at 2h and a half",6,7,11,2 March 2020
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A little better than the first
","It's been some time since my last review, but I just got back from seeing the new Sherlock Holmes movie and I have to say that I really enjoyed myself. RDJ portrays a very convincing Sherlock Holmes(of course) as in the first movie, I can guarantee that you will laugh a lot on this one, Jude law is very good as Dr. Watson, but I have to say that I am a little disappointed with the fact that the role of Rachel McAdams was short, even tough people should be pleased with Noomi Rapace filling in for her. Jarred Harris makes a great villain in this one, as the main bad guy in the Sherlock Holmes Universe, I say he proves a real challenge for Holmes, being more dangerous and intelligent than Mark Stron's Lord Blackwood, but a little too diplomatic at times. The special effects are great as in the first movie, with excellent slow-motion action scenes and there are also a few of those mind images from Holmes before he starts kicking some a**! 'A Game of Shadows' did very well in my book so GO SEE IT! Because it's worth the money. Fingers crossed for a third.",9,0,2,30 December 2011
Thor," When you'll see 'Thor' you'll want to see more!
","Awesome, superb, epic!!! I've yet to see a movie that made me so eager to see it as 'Thor', I really couldn't wait for the premiere and... I wasn't disappointed, not one bit. The new Marvel movie about the Norse God of Thunder has the potential to become a top 3 best of all time superhero movies. While standing in the theatre and watching it for 2 hours made me feel like only 10 minutes had past since i've sat down, the story sums up pretty much all the essentials of the Mighty Avengers STORY, Hemsworth does a great job as the thunderer , great acting, a lot of charisma, he was cast perfectly,good accent too, excellent performance by Hopkins and an ever more impressive one by Hiddlestone as Loki. Special effects were superb, (Asgard looks amazing)but not forced over the edge, the movie has it's parts that make you laugh and also the fighting scenes are superb and sufficient, I couldn't have wanted more or less! Idris Elba does an excellent Heimdall and personally I loved Jaimie Alexander as Sif. The story really sticks together, Brannagh did a wonderful job from top to finish. Having already seen Iron man 1 and 2 and the Incredible Hulk, and now Thor, the big picture is starting to be clear: can't wait for Captain America! I just want to say AVENGERS! ASSEMBLE! This is my very first review, and I did it because I loved 'Thor'so much and I hope you will too and that this will be helpful!",8,12,24,30 April 2011
