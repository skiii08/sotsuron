Skyfall," What a waste of time
","Very disappointing movie. Not really BOND at all. If the main character's name was not James Bond, you would not thing that it is 007 movie. No gadgets, no cars, no girls and no cheesy one-liners.... The real Bond is sophisticated, knowledgeable and chauvinistic womanizer, who is using his head and gadgets. No need for Chuck Norris-style fights. Real Bond is gentleman-spy. But alas, with arrival of D Craig, we have another Bourne/whatever else action movies with tough, but sensitive agent. Blah.... No gadgets??? The new Q is looking like an IT geek, not convincing, and why would you have Q when there is no gadgets? Bond girl who gets kill off almost immediately. Plot, that has been over-used in so many movies. Stolen list of agents??? Really??? I mean, REALLY????????Very poor story telling:1) How was the list stolen? 2) Why was there a trap-door in jail? 3) How did Bond survive the fall?4) Why did Eve, after shooting Bond, did not shoot the villain â€“ she had a automatic rifle, you know...5) At one point, Eve is chasing the train, one minute later, she is so ahead she has a time to stop, take the gun out and 'think about shooting'6) How did Bond end up on the beach after the fall?7) WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MISSING LIST OF AGENTS?????? Frankly, this is the most over-rated and also the worst Bond movie ever!!!! Well done to Sam Mendez.",1,5,11,14 March 2013
