The Equalizer," Better than I had expected
","My expectation were not high when I began watching this movie (mostly due to the fact that there are a dozen movies like this out there, with similar Russian mob clichÃ©s). But I am a huge Denzel fan, and I must admit that there is a part of me that enjoys watching people get brutally punished for their sins.This movie made me feel happy, happy that justice exists at least in the movies. It gives me a break from the harsh realities of life and how helpless we are when it comes to crime syndicates. I enjoyed this movie more than I had expected, particularly the music which just seemed very dark and appropriate.Every man has a sadist hidden deep inside of him and since we live in a civilized society, take out your frustrations by watching this movie. It worked for me, it should work for you.",8,6,14,11 December 2014
Fast & Furious 6," I'm going to be very straightforward
","I'm usually descriptive in my reviews, but I'm not going to do that for this movie. This movie is simple entertainment. It does not require any brain power to understand the storyline in this movie. Beautiful cars. Beautiful girls. Hunky men. Yeap. Epic.The second you start using your brain while watching the movie, you start noticing the idiocy that had taken place. For instance, how huge will Dwayne Johnson go before he just turns from the Rock into the Boulder?Also, at the very last scene, how long is the damn runway? I mean seriously?Regardless, I still enjoyed the movie. It entertained me, and as a petrol head, this movie is definitely enjoyable.Should you watch it? Yeah, why not.",7,0,2,8 July 2013
Pacific Rim," Putting Transformers to shame
","Transformers was an amazing movie. When it first came out, it was a blockbuster movie. Everyone was talking about it, everyone bought the toys, everyone couldn't wait for a sequel.For quite some time, Transformers was left unchallenged. I mean really, that movie has a cult following. To challenge it would be stupid. Or is it?Pacific Rim proves that Transformers does not monopolize the giant robot/action/CGI movie industry. When I first watched it, I noticed two things: (1) The storyline was very predictable (2) I didn't care about '(1)', because most of time my face looked like this -> =O or =DTransformers had the wow factor, but it is a kid's movie compared to Pacific Rim. But the main reason I'd rate this movie 9 stars is because it brought the whole 'Godzilla' and 'King Kong' monster movies back in to limelight. They made evil mindless giants destroying cities cool again.Whats even better, this time, we fight back with giants of our own. If you're like me, you've played games like 'Mech Warrior' or 'Gears of War', then you will definitely love this movie. The giant robots are controlled by humans, like the giant robots in 'Power Rangers' but 1000 times cooler.In my opinion however, the main selling point of this movie is the fact that Guillermo del Toro really stretched the limits of his imagination this time, fusing the Eastern 'Godzilla' with the Western 'King Kong' and adding a pinch of 'Alien', creating his 'Kaiju'. He reflects these monsters with the robots too,creating 'Jaegers'. The wow factor in this movie is definitely that, combined with the amazing graphics. The tacky lines like the part where Mako Mori says 'For my family!' before slashing the Kaiju or the part where Raleigh says 'We're out of options' when they had a blade they didn't use until halfway through the movie, may make you frown a little when watching it. But that's all it does. You just frown. A little. You're still going to enjoy the movie, it really doesn't change anything.Ultimately, this movie is definitely going to be a classic. It doesn't matter what you may think, it's a movie that people will watch again and again, just to watch some robots beat the crap out of monsters. It is in the same league as the legendary 'Godzilla' and 'King Kong', and Guillermo del Toro is indeed deserving of awards (which I am sure he will get) for creating such a masterpiece.He has indeed, done it again.",9,2,8,12 July 2013
Nightcrawler," They got the angle just right
","I tried to come up with a slightly tacky title for my review, but I couldn't think of any.I'm not one for going into 'deep' movie plot analysis, I prefer reviewing movies from the perspective of a common person. Having said that, I though this movie is absolutely fantastic.Jake Gyllenhaal performed so well it gave me goosebumps. Well the goosebumps bit is a lie, but he did do extremely well. It is amazing how he personified a corporation. The sheer heartlessness of every single on of his actions depict the reality of the numerous corporations around the world. I love how it began with the audience not knowing what was going on. We were left with a blank sheet of paper for us to start jotting down details of who and what Louis Bloom is all about. Halfway through, I still had no idea who he was or why he's chosen his current path. But by the end, you realize that it doesn't matter. All that matters is what you see.The ending leaves you a little dazed and rather awestruck. It is a great movie, and will not be forgotten anytime in the near future.",8,0,1,11 December 2014
The Incredibles," Pixar does it again!
","I have to be honest, I started out as a hardcore 'cartoon only' Disney fan. Then came two of the greatest animated movies of all time, Toy Story and A Bugs Life. I loved these two movies so much that I knew, I was wrong. 3D cartoons had indeed created a pretty huge fan base, with Pixar spearheading this revolution. Incredibles is another brilliant movie by them. I love everything about it. I love how the characters are all unique in their own way, how the action sequences can be comical at the same time and most of all, I love that I can watch this with my family over and over again, and never get bored of it. That's how good it is. I may be overselling it, but mind you, it is a children's movie, and as such is created in such a way that it is easily understood by a child. This means that as adults, the storyline may seem a little underwhelming. Which is true to a certain extent. Regardless, it is without a shadow of a doubt, ENTERTAINING! And in the end, isn't that all that matters?",8,0,0,3 July 2013
The Last Samurai," One of the best Samurai movies out there
","Growing up in Asia in the 90's, I was exposed to a lot of samurai and ninja cartoons and movies. As a teenager, I've played many samurai games and even practice Kendo myself.Having said that, the Last Samurai holds true to the way of the samurai. The way in which Tom Cruise carries his role is done spectacularly. The beautifully choreographed fight sequences are worth of praise.The storyline of this movie however is nothing off the charts. In fact, it was down right predictable. However, it was a predictably interesting storyline. Combined with the music of Hans Zimmer, this movie never fails to bring up a few goosebumps or tears from me. Good music almost always equals to a good movie, and this movie has the perfect oriental styled orchestra music to feed your musical needs.The Last Samurai is one of those few movies that delivers a wholesome meal of Samurai action. If you love Samurais as much as I do, you're going to love this movie.",10,0,0,25 January 2012
