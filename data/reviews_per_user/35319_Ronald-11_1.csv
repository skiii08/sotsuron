Scarface," Scarface - A Victim of Tragic Virtue
","Unlike the original, 'Scarface' is no mere gangster movie.  This is a rare instance where the remake outshines the original, in this case with its withering criticism of American society and politics.  Forced into exile from Cuba by communist Fidel Castro, the ruthless Tony Montana finds America much more to his liking (a 'giant p**** waiting to be f***ed').  He is the true American, detesting Communism's totalitarian restrictions on individual freedom (a 'chuvato on every corner').  He personifies what to many is the true American success story, rapidly rising to the top by breaking the law, 'making his own moves'.  He is helped to the top by many ostensibly respectable and law-abiding Americans, including corrupt cops, lawyers, bankers and media people  - in exchange for a cut of the action, of course. In fact, America loves 'Scarface' - he takes all of the risks, while they sit back, exploit and collect.'Scarface' is ruthless but subscribes to his own code of morality ('I never ****ed anybody over who didn't have it coming to him').  Whether it is the Communist murderer Emilio Revenga, the Columbians who try to burn him, the boss who tries to kill him, or the cop who tried to milk him, Scarface is merely the an inexorable instrument of justice for people who 'have it coming to them'.With the assistance of a South American drug lord and a corrupt State Department official, Scarface is about to escape jail by fixing the judge. His total disregard for even basic rules ('Don't get high on your own supply', 'Don't underestimate the other guy's greed) and his radical indivdualism (Who put this thing together? - me.  Who do I trust? - me) are already leading him down the path of self-destruction. But in the end, he is brought down by a single act of mercy and goodness - his 'tragic virtue' - his affection for children.In addition to financially exploiting people like 'Scarface', our society uses him for psychological purposes.  He is the ruthless gangster-criminal we all point to as being worse than we are. ('So say hello to the bad guy'). But all he does is sell drugs to people who want to buy them and spend the cash on those willing the launder it.  'Scarface' would not be possible except for our own hypocritical evil.  Scarface is more lucid about this projection phenomenon and his own self-destructiveness than the other character is the film ('I always tell the truth - even when I lie').At the end of the film, Tony Montana appears to be more moral and more of a victim than most of the other characters.Even though I don't like most of Oliver Stone's work, I have to give him credit for this story and script - it will stand the test of time and eventually be recognized as an American classic.   Also, the acting is uniformly superb, from Pacino's brilliance to the major debuts by Pfeiffer, Mastroantonio and Bauer, to the remarkable performances by lesser knowns like Loggia, Shenar and Yulin.",Null,2,4,14 July 2001
