The Blair Witch Project," it's amazing how all in all sucking flick can attract as many admirers!
","i saw it. and all i can say once is far enough (i got even trouble to view it all through to the end and not to stop). my opinion is this movie sucks. well, we can praise it for originality but it is not enough. there is no suspense whatsoever, the only matter of first 4/5 of the movie is nonstop hysterical screaming heather and the fact that they are lost and sometimes they hear some strange sounds and occasionaly see some strange artefacts that look like witchcraft. i'm not in favor of tons of ketchup spilled in so called 'horrors' like hellraiser or nightmares on elm street, but this really lack the great dramatic suspense and the gradually raised tension of some hitchock and spielberg flicks.",2,0,2,20 February 2000
Casablanca," What else to say - it is a classic!
","Well, it is hard to say anything about this movie which has not been already said. But even though nowadays film makers have millions $ and thousands of hi-tech effects to film whatever they want, they should always come to movies like Casablanca to see how great performance can be done just with cleverly chosen music, brilliant acting and dialogues. Of course the movie is dependent on circumstances under which it was made and nobody would believe that things would really happen exactly like that, but the heck with it - it can easily be forgiven. And regarding the fact it was filmed in 40's when the war was far from being finished, the propagandistic aspect of the movie could have been far worse. The atmosphere of the movie is absolutely awesome and I think that nobody can declare himself to be a movie fan unless he saw Casablanca.",10,1,1,14 March 2002
We Were Soldiers," Not as bad as some people here say, not as good either
","SPOILERS HEREIN!Well, this is not a serious and compelling war movie like the Platoon was. Rather than that it resembles Saving Private Ryan in many ways. We need to thank these movies for one major thing. They portray the war in the naturalistic way. I can imagine someone may walk out of the theater after seeing some scenes of this movie, but hey, the war is even hundred times more gross than any movie can be. But starting with Saving Private Ryan, the trend to unleash the evil spirit of war and bring it to the movie screen started and this movie continues in it, and does pretty well. Also I liked, that the movie did not try to bring up any philosophical aspects, just shown the plain war, nothing more but also nothing less. Also the music is well written and accompanies the movie nicely, particularly I liked the main song.But then there comes the bad stuff. And that is the plot - well, although I definitely must give some credit to the writer for leaving out the usual Vietnam controversy stuff, there are numerous other unnecessary scenes, such as American flag waving in the highest emotional scenes, it has been currently some kind of fashion in the movies of this type, but is it REALLY THAT necessary? Also the scene with the soldiers gathering at the airport in the middle of the night to leave for Vietnam - come on, give me a break! And final, and the worst - why the heck Moore first leaves two thirds of his men die in the hellish battle and then second day suddenly calls for the airstrike? Does that make ANY sense whatsoever?  And then, am I the only one who thinks the soldiers behaved like monks in the monastery? No f-words, no profanity. Would that really happen in the situation like that? A bit unrealistic, at least for me.So the conclusion - I have to praise this flick for the portrayal of the hell of war. But I also have to put it down for unnecessary scenes, unrealistic political correctness and some flaws in acting. Lets break it even then - 5/10",6,1,2,23 November 2002
Lost in Translation," Very strong piece of work
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREINIt would be fair to say at first that I generally do not like so called 'romantic' movies, unless they convey an authentic feeling with which I could identify. And I must say this movie gets it big time. First, I very much like the way it portraits the cultural shock. And second, I just cannot believe Hollywood can make an ending like that. I do not want to spoil it but I really expected that he will at the last moment turn away and run to her and stay with her forever :))). It is something like Pavlov's reflex because I have seen so many movies in which the ending would be exactly like that. Therefore I must praise the folks who made this for not fulfilling the usual expectation. Plus the lead actors very both very good and the music was very beautifully crafted.My overall rating is a very strong 8 (of 10).",8,0,1,9 November 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Pure virtual reality
","Well, I was thinking a lot after seeing this movie. I was thinking why some people like this so much. Then I finally found out. Such movies are successful because they portrait the reality in the way people wish it to be. There are definitely many people who consider fast cars young chicks, adrenaline and all that other stuff around extremely cool. And this is a movie for them. Virtual reality, something that WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. The movie accomplished this task, no doubt about it. If you are in a target group - I would say that would be mostly men under 25 - you will probably like it. Fast cars, lot of racing scenes, dynamic music, clipish cinematography, easy-on-the-eyes chicks -  nothing important is missing. You will be attracted by the atmosphere of the movie so much, you will forgive it apparent non-senses, lame plot, dumb dialogues and unbelievability - but gosh, who cares, virtual reality does not have to be believable.All of us who expect movies to reflect reality at least to certain extent, and to portrait some aspects of life in original way, yes, we have to be disappointed. But we are not a target group. And makers of this movie hit THEIR target group big time, I am pretty sure about that.4/10 since I am not the target group.",4,0,1,11 March 2002
The Pianist," Why the best movies of the year hardly ever get an Oscar?
","Well, I am kind of used to that the best movie of the year never gets an Oscar recently (save for Forrest Gump and American Beauty of course). Most flagrant mistakes of the Academy are their choice of Titanic over As Good as It Gets in 1998 and awarding Chicago over the Pianist in 2003. And the worst thing is that the Schindler's List which is in some points similar yet worse than the Pianist was awarded. Well there is no justice on earth.
Anyway, the strongest point of this movie is the story. The survival of a jewish top pianist through the dreadful WW II in Warsaw, Poland. Of course, there have been numbers of movies like that but this one is so beautifully crafted that it leaves trails in your memory forever. After seing a movie like this one must be assured that the atrocities of WW II must never be forgotten.Couple the wonderful story with a great acting and cinematography and there is a masterpiece and you bet this one is. Go see it, because words are not enough here. 10/10 - It is a no-brainer.",10,0,1,28 October 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Original and pretty well done.
","I would be the last one giving any credit to any movie, in which Tom Cruise is cast. Most of his movies suck but this one is a great exception. I like the way the plot goes, Cruise and Kidman`s acting is far better, than their average. The most remarkable moment is the discussion after they smoke the pot, it is one of those where woman and man can never get to any conclusion at all :-)",8,0,1,3 September 2000
Enemy at the Gates," 5/10 for lack of realism and redundant love scenes
","Some of the following might be considered as SPOILER!Well this is exactly one of the movies you see and do not have to see again, even though you were not THAT disappointed. In another words, nice way to spend an evening when you have no better things to do.Now, let's discuss the details a little bit. First, since Saving Private Ryan Hollywood enjoys grossly naturalistic scenes in war movies. I think it is right since war IS like that. Even the most famous war flicks made in 60's focused on production and cast, but were far too nice to the viewing audience in not exposing them too much to the real stuff. Saving Private Ryan did that and so did Enemy At The Gates. But the good ends right there.
I am not detail specialist and I cannot tell whether the guns, uniforms and stuff used in the movie is historically right, but there are still some major things that are so screamingly unbelievable even in common sense. First, the boy, I know Russians use the legend of heroic kids acting like spies so much, but in fact most kids are not mentally capable to do this at their age. Second, the major. Acting like cold blooded professional the whole movie through, right? Then WHY THE HECK does he come up to the open area without noticing person standing on his left side also in open area during the final showdown? Could the best Nazi sniper be so foolish?And the love story? I refuse to give any comment on that. Americans just have to have melodramatic crap in every flick recently. So let them be.

A Beautiful Mind," Nice idea but not fulfilled
","The final thought that came into my mind when I saw the scrolling cast and credits of this movie was that it could have done better. It is not a bad movie, but there are some aspects that distort the picture. The idea of the movie is certainly extraordinary, acting is superb so is music and cinematography but dialogues destroy it. I have not seen so overdone dialogues for a long time and accompanied with strange way Nash speaks in the movie (which was probably intended to emphasis his difference from 'normal' people) often left me wondering, 'what the heck did he say?'. Anyway, I do not know whether this is the best movie of 2001, but I give it 7. It is definitely worth watching but it is definitely lacking the sense of masterpiece.",7,0,1,6 April 2002
War of the Worlds," Movies like this should come in U.S. and European editions
","First, I have to say I was completely astonished by this movie. It is dark. It is crude. You can really believe the horror of the characters. Great music, camera, effects, everything, Tom Cruise as the lead is top notch. So far, I would say I was watching a 10/10 movie. However, there are some things that make me to subtract at least one point. First, THE ENDING. Why THE HELL? Ummm.... well, it is a waste of time to point out that the Hollywood endings can totally screw up entirely awesome film, as they did million times before. I really think movies like this should come with different U.S. and European editions. U.S. edition could have cheesy sentimental endings like this movie and European edition could end... well, the worst thing is, that I can exactly imagine where the movie should have ended - beware of spoiler here - do you see it? The hand of the dead E.T. comes out of the tripod, some music comes in, maybe a shot of Tom and the girl, and here come the end titles. I would be more than happy with the ending like this, which would not undermine the atmosphere of the movie.Also, I think that bloody weed thing or whatever it was and ripping that guy towards the end of the movie were unnecessary, the movie would be better of without this scene.As I said, otherwise perfect. I would not be surprise, if Spielberg gets another Oscar for this.",9,0,2,9 July 2005
Gladiator," expensive production, realistic details, but not the story
","well, these movies are all the same. super expensive production, huge cast, stunning tricks and lot of ketchup spilled to arrange the bloody details. the production is awesome, acting not bad, but the story is not realistic at all. it seems to me that there is new wave of such movies, which were most popular in sixties coming on right now. the new ones are much more graphic, but often lack the atmosphere in comparison to the old ones. but i have to admit, gladiator is not that bad all in all. i like the opening scene especially, that is a masterpiece.",5,0,0,9 July 2000
