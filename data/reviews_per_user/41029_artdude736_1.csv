It," 'It' Definitely FLOATS Above All The Others In The 2017 Horror Genre
","I was surprised at just how much BETTER this remake was than the 1990 version of 'It'! For starters,ALL of the children cast did a phenomenal job. The actor who portrayed Pennywise was both creepier and more disturbing! This actor made the character his own and was nothing at all like Tim Curry.Enjoyed most of the writing and changes of this version of the movie. Overall, I thought 'It' was great and I'd go see it again.For fans of dumb-downed, Slasher Horror Films like 'Saw', this is NOT ONE OF THEM!!! This is a smart, entertaining horror film with good writing and character development. Go see 'IT' for yourself.",9,4,12,10 September 2017
