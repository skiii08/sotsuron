Ford v Ferrari," I'm Not a Car Person, but...
","CHRISTIAN BALE. CHRISTIAN BALE. Yes, Matt Damon was good, but CHRISTIAN BALE! He completely became Ken Miles, and he was mesmerizing! After Vice and then this, you can see what an incredible actor he is, with an unmatched range. The movie was directed very well, and had great scenes of race car driving. I also loved it for what it lacked...no gratuitous sex, violence, etc, that permeate today's movies. Just a great story! Do yourself a favor and see this movie!",10,7,18,15 November 2019
A Star Is Born," Great, but not a masterpiece
","I really, really did like this movie. Maybe even loved this movie! Yes, the acting is great, the plot realistic and gripping, the music phenomenal. Yes it's an incredible directorial debut! However, the movie was not uplifting, which I was hoping and expecting. Instead I left the theater depressed and feeling as if I just went through the wringer. Don't get me wrong, it was wonderful, it just wasn't anything near uplifting and beautiful. Having said this, I'd encourage anyone to see it once!",8,3,5,12 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Wow!!! Incredible and breathtaking!
","I am not a huge Star Wars aficionado, however even I appreciated how the previous movies in the series were tied together in this one. It was filled with special effects (make that amazing effects that made me wished the space age was here now), acted very well (love Daisy Ridley!), and had cameos by so many beloved actors of the past. I know some critics are panning this, but I thought it was great! My 25 year old son saw it with me, and loved it too!",9,2,15,29 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It was good but...
","Like most Quentin Tarantino films, this one follows the same formula. Take a plot, put it in a blender, chop it up, then put unrelated pieces together, until you have enough of a timeline for a full movie. It was strange, with some good lines and good parts of the plot, but also stupid ones, just for effect. By the time an hour had gone by I couldn't wait for it to be over. I don't really understand the Charles Manson and his followers being part of the film either...it was gratuitous to me, and disrespectful to Tate's family. It had zero to do with the plot, and was just thrown in, with a lot of graphic violence to top it off. I do love Leonardo DiCaprio, and look forward to seeing him in a better movie than this mishmash.",4,3,9,27 July 2019
1917," I didn't want to even like this movie, but instead I love it
","What superlatives can be used on a movie like this? One that touches the senses in ways that you never saw coming, that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go, haunting your thoughts at random moments for years after. This is '1917'. A brilliantly told story, cinematography that makes you realize what a movie should be, a heart stopping score, phenomenal acting, special effects that are top notch, and, most of all, a story that punches you right in the gut, and makes you so grateful for all of the soldiers who have ever fought for us, and given all so many times. It is a movie that I am going to watch on Veteran's Day, and more importantly, think of when I see a vet selling poppies, or needing help with something. Yes, this movie touches you that much. It should, hands down, get best picture, and several other Oscars too!",10,0,3,1 February 2020
Parasite," WTF is this???
","I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that 'the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good'. So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the 'really good' part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)",1,26,45,16 February 2020
