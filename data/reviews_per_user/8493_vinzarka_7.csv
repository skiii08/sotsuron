The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Why u spend money and our time for such bullshits?
","It is one of the most boring movie...no meaning...senseless and i don't understand some people who judge this movie because of the acting of main actor?!?!?! Who is responsible for wasting two hours of my life with such a loser subject? Maybe the game is famous and beautiful to play and this loser director should create something more nicer than just a game and i realized that this director is good to spend money for fake empty boring senseless ideas. I didn't understand anything what happened. I don't know what is the idea of this movie, what is the subject or what is the moral. I cannot tell even to my friends what happened in these two hours with this Katniss or Peeta or other amateur soldiers with their pretending moves. I would punish this director not to have chance to make a movie again in his life.",1,25,36,22 March 2015
The Revenant," Don't let Iñárritu in to Oscars!!!
","Zero emotions! The critics about this movie are unlimited. My expectations are so disappointing in all directions. This movie has no meaning. Pity for Leo DI Caprio that did the best to support his role and he really did it good but he cant make the story better. It looks Inarritu wanted to show off with things that public never seen before. It looks this famous director had nothing more to create and to attract with meaningful things and he created such fake and cannibal stories to look impressive and interesting. I would not let Inarritu in to participate in Oscars 2016. Maybe he need some rest to do a better movie and not to spend movie budget for his distracted and unfocused fantasies. Anyway, Good Luck to Leo!",1,9,18,27 February 2016
Non-Stop," Non good taste movie
",Is that movie which inspires terrorism? If this movie which learn us how to be protected or how we can be fought by terrorism? However...i don't like that idea and how this director treated that scenario.It started well. It looks that director was full of ideas and so energetic...but at the middle of movie that fantasy and imagination wanes. That hijacked airplane look kidnapped by technology and not by amateur people and at the end we see that these bad guys were so weak physically and they planned everything so perfectly but they couldn't manage even a weapon in their hands. The end was a bullshit. How the director closed that scenario was so poor and bad idea. Not smart at all! Good luck in next movie!,4,0,0,30 January 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Special movie
","I was surprised of this funny interesting subject. That story includes many interesting facts about how we can see things nd maybe how things can or could be. The acting between actor and events is amazing and the editing is sometimes so fast but with meaning. From the technical point i have no complain at all. Also the subject is more than 90% perfect and so constructed in every detail. The script is very funny and with a lot fantasy and impressing. What it considered a bit slowly is the part after the prison when they are escaped. The main actor is telling many and many things, in fat, bullshits, unnecessary. We know that we can put such things in movie...but when the film is so beautiful and full of nice information and lovely games, why the director did put such boring small parts of lazy conversation? however, congratulations!",8,1,3,8 January 2015
Call Me by Your Name," I didn't give 10 stars only for two reasons!
","I dont know where to start telling what a great movie it was! Acting perfect and original. Sceneries and these landscapes are my favorite and the most lovely ones included their lifestyles so near the nature with fruits and fresh juices.All life there was described so realistic. All relatioships were the most visualised simply the best. Oh the music! It was made for this film and this scenario and it fitted perfectly from beginning till the end. I didn't give 10 stars only for two reasons. There were some parts or episodes or moments that i fund unexplained or unnecessary or meaningless or not connected well in editing or the continuity of film. other reason is the coming of Oliver. He looked arrogant. It looks like he knew that in the house was a guy, gay, who wanted his attention etc etc. He was acting all the time with so much confidence about these gay feelings between them. The confidence was mixed with his knowledges about his profession and gay feelings. All the time he was treating Elio not in normal way that somebody would treat someone in these positions. It was a big exaggerated his attitude toward to this teenager Elio who knew almost nothing about sex and Elio was also exploring and facing a lot with opposite sex and thats too much for both roles.",9,0,3,26 January 2018
The Big Short," The most boring movie for 2015
",Under zero emotions! The story supposed to be great but it wasn't. That drama was not a drama but just some pieces of stories that this director tried to joined by force and to give a meaning during its way. Most of the biggest troubles was that camera that never stopped shaking and zooming in and out and moving up and down with no sense even in the most quiet portrait. There is no need to play with moving camera in senseless way to make the story more dramatic. Big disappointing even in some characters there. Not professional. Pretending! I would ask to this director to give me back the time i spent to watch his bullshit and maybe to tell to him how he can do this movie in more positive way.,1,22,53,27 February 2016
What We Do in the Shadows," Why i didn't laugh at all? Oh, i see...because it was the biggest bullshit in the world!!!
","I am not judging because of cinematography, because of the picture was very well and also their make up. i know i am pretending with such compliments but what else to say? It is really the most waster time of my life with such idiot scenario and this senseless acting without ingoing and outgoing somewhere. Pointless! It is a very big shock for me to watch that absurd horror movie. i still don't understand why they throw money for nothing? I accept that not everything is for everyone. I did read some reviews when people laughed loudly a lot a lot and a lot and i wish i was any of them. The most stupid characters with a messy story around them following nothing with their dialog.",1,32,119,31 March 2015
