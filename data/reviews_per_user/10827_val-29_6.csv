Ford v Ferrari," Awesome, Awesome and Awesome
","Not gonna bore you with a long review, One of my fave films this year !!",10,2,3,26 February 2020
First Man," Great Action, Intense Acting but not for NASA officiandos
","I have had a life long interest in the Apollo space programme so to start with I would have to say this is not particularly accurate. In an attempt to make an intense film they have overdone the sound/visual effects with respect to the rocket launches. Gemini was known as the 'bucking bronco' but watch the film (Gemini 8 launch) and any rocket suffering that much vibration would have disintegrated. The flight of the x15 is the same with Neil staring wide eyed and saying nothing, just breathing heavily in fear. The guy was a test pilot and on a test flight !! - he wouldn't have stopped talking as that was his job to report on the systems of the aircraft etc. As for flying experimental aircraft whilst scared witless, He is a test pilot for god's sake !!. The 'family' of astronauts is touched on but again all too intense and I agree with one user who said it was all a bit sombre and miserable. Lots of silent pauses and acting with a 'look'. However saying that I enjoyed the film as an action film with some powerful launch sequences as seen through the eyes of Neil. I know I said not very accurate but good cinema !! Well worth a watch but don't look for technical errors cause you will fill your notebook.",8,0,1,8 November 2018
Hidden Figures," Great film but don't take it as accurate
",I watched this film and loved it but having just read the book by Margot Lee Shetterley I realise how inaccurate it is. Most of the racism was experienced by the woman when they worked for the NACA (the forerunner of NASA) and once NASA was in place they didn't have segregation issues. Rather than write a large synopsis I refer you to the entry by M. Campbell below who has summed the film's accuracy up nicely.,Null,0,2,3 September 2017
Joker," 11/10 in my opinion - just WOW !!!
","Did not know what to expect, the joker is a cartoon character and this film has brought him to life. A psychological study of how an individual can descend into a criminal monster.
Great film and worthy of the hype surrounding it. This will be remembered as Phoenix's finest role and will define him as among the greats.",10,7,11,26 February 2020
Midway," Loved it
","Great movie, with a few historical errors but seat of the pants watching none-the-less.
Only slight criticism - Covering Pearl Harbour, Doolittle Raid, Coral Sea and Marshall Islands in the first hour was a bit head spinning and without some historical knowledge would leave the viewer confused.
Worth watching.",9,1,3,26 February 2020
Sully," OK at Best
","Having been interested in air crash investigations I have seen many documentaries on the subject. One thing that rings true is the professionalism and thoroughness of investigations by the NTSB who's sole aim is to establish the cause of the accident and advise any safety recommendations that may arise. They are not their to judge and certainly do not hold hearings until all obtainable facts are at their fingertips. When this film came out I was waiting to see it with baited breath. Unfortunately I found it disappointing. It chopped backwards and forwards in time which I accept is a story telling technique but I think it was a little overboard BUT accept that that is a personal issue. Where I have a big problem is the portrayal of the NTSB who came across as a 'Gestapo' type organisation intent on bringing Sully down. This is not a fair representation of the NTSB and I don't think it was necessary to sell the film. Please watch the many good documentaries on Air crash investigations, such as the 'Mayday' series - available on 'youtube'. The one on this particular incident will show you what I mean. Enough said !!",6,1,1,3 September 2017
