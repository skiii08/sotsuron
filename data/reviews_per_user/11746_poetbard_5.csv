Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," good, but could have been better
","The movie was entertaining. The special effects were supreme of course. The weak points were the occasional wooden acting and the somewhat incomplete character development. But the picture was surprisingly better than what I expected, given its unfavorable reviews.",8,0,0,24 May 1999
The Ring," long on atmosphere, short on logic
","What exactly is this film about? The ending really made no sense. The film was well acted and directed, but I felt cheated at the end. I spent two hours watching I don't know what.",6,0,0,6 November 2002
Before Sunset," instituted brilliance.
","No special effects. No action. No super big name stars. No great scenery. no large cast, in fact it's a cast of two.One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Marvelously underplayed romantic drama. Writing, acting, directing sublimely subtle. Only drawback, you must see Before Sunset first to get the full effect of this movie. But that's no hardship since that film is just as good. The two masterpieces form a segue. In age of overproduced eye candy this is a welcome relief. It's a modern day version of Marty. The duologue is believable. You really feel for these two. There are really only two characters, but you hardly notice. Their acting could be an exemplar on the craft. The script is engrossing. I can't praise these two films enough. If you remember and liked the film Marty then you'll love there two gems. (The two films and the the two actors Julie Deply and Etan Hawke",10,0,0,23 March 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," for some reason I sat still for three hours
","A true spectacular. Massive armies fighting. Actors speaking very stilted dialogue. Massive armies fighting. Massive armies fighting, for no particular reason. The evil one literally is chased up a tree. Deius ex machina all over the place. Massive armies fighting. Something about a gnome and a ring and a barefoot midget with hairy feet. For some reason I liked the movie, and I have no idea why.",8,0,0,21 December 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Almost a Buddhist parable
","What is the purpose of reincarnation if one has no memory of a previous life? How can you learn from your mistakes if you've forgotten that you ever made them? And what passes from a previous life to the next if there is no memory of a previous existence?In a subtle way this movie addresses these questions. But instead of lifetimes, love affairs are used. And it's love that passes through the generations. Soul mates are destined to find each other, again and again, despite the trivial incompatibilities. This is a marvelous, original movie. Beautifully, and acted directed. The film is not really a science fiction. It's a moral parable.",10,1,3,18 August 2005
