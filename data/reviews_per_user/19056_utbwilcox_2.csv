Blade Runner 2049," 2 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back
","Im stunned to see favorable reviews of this utter garbage. I walked out of the theater shaking my head wondering what the purpose of this movie was. There was no story, no true drama or suspense and the characters were not likable. It was neither edgy or original. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

Justice League," A lot of fun
","I was pleasantly surprised how much fun this one was. The characters were funny and had great chemistry together. Affleck was fabulous Bruce Wayne. I also now have high hopes for solo Aquaman and Flash movies. Going into the movie, I wasn't so sure. I hope Affleck stays on as Batman and they continue on this path they are on.",8,0,1,27 November 2017
