The Blair Witch Project," 'THAT'S YOUR MOTIVATION!!'
","Look, kids. I know that there may not have been any bloody, severed heads in this movie, but I am a firm believer that the scariest things are the ones you cannot see. BWP is not graphic. But it is scary as hell. A buncha kids, hangin' around in the woods so their overzealous and fearless(?) leader can do a school project for film class. They smoke, they drink, and they swear. I mean they freakin' SWEAR. And they get in way the hell over their head. Realistic dialogue, funny one liners, believeable characters, scenery that matches the story, and an ending that will leave your mouth open. Watch, and use your imaginations; what's up there us scarier than anything they could put on screen.",Null,0,1,15 October 2001
Silent Hill," A major disappointment
","I am a huge fan of the silent hill franchise of games, and I was so excited about the movie, especially since the look and the sound in the trailers seemed so true to what made the games so great. Because of that, I expected greatness, and a feeling that matched the vibe the games so skillfully send across. I did not find it. What I found was a deficit of psychological scares, a multitude of gore, merely for gore's sake, and a film untrue to the spirit of the game. I know some people were genuinely frightened by this film, and I guess I can understand that, sort of. I think, however, that many fans of the game will be sorely disappointed by the film. The attempts to throw in scares that would be familiar to gamers (i.e., Pyramid Head) seemed to be just that: thrown in. There were holes in the plot big enough to put my hand through, the end was unsatisfactory, and the gore was just pointless. In my opinion, despite the fantastic look of this movie, the feeling was just all wrong. Sigh. What a letdown",3,0,1,30 April 2006
All the President's Men," If you haven't seen this film yet, you need to.
","Watergate stood alone when the story broke. Never before in the history of American politics (to our knowledge, at least) had people so high up in the government been so deeply involved in such treachery. For that reason, 'APM' is an incredibly important movie. Hoffman and Redford are so believable as the two oft-clashing Washington Post reporters, it's as if you are actually watching Bernstein and Woodward uncover the story. The late Jason Robards is impossibly convincing as the unrelenting and brilliant Ben Bradlee. 'APM' is an absolute masterpiece, and should be required viewing for anyone who cares about their first amendment rights.",Null,1,1,18 January 2001
