Source Code," eight minutes of repetitive crap
","First, the pilot dies but he can still talk sensibly to the doctor, who put's his consciousness into the mind of a dead victim, by means of a computer who conveniently remember's the last eight minutes of the crash. Furthermore, the pilot is then able to replay this eight minutes in any way he chooses, which is absolute crap.. It doesn't make sense, and I can't see why anybody would like this film, everything is rubbish.. a programmer apparently, knows exactly what everyone is doing, thinking, saying where in fact they are all blown up already and is totally burnt... and the ending where decided by the audience score card. If he is already dead, and he is inside a computer(???) how come that he is still standing there, where in reality they already ended up the program by pushing the button..( it really doesn't make sense..none of it make sense..)Leaving everybody in the audience, wishing they could use the computer to go back and regain the TWO hours they lost watching this CRAP!!!",1,32,64,9 April 2011
Groundhog Day," You Couldn't Make This a Better Film Even if You Remade it Every Day for the Rest of Your Life!
","Easily my favorite film of all time, comedy or any other genre!Everything about it is just perfect (maybe they had a few tries to get it right?).I wouldn't get bored if I was stuck watching it again and again every day...I envy people seeing this one for the first time.Every time I watch it my cheeks hurt so much.Bill Murray's Best Movie, and he's made a few good ones.Cheers, Greg.PS: Is tomorrow another day?",10,2,4,12 August 2010
