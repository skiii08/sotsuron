Men in Black 3," Laughable
","Really sorry I spent the money to rent this movie on iTunes. It is fine that they didn't use a lot of the same people/aliens as used in the first two movies, but to alter the characters of the main characters just didn't seem real.In Men In Black filmed in 1997, Agent K was still hung up on his girlfriend he had to leave behind when he joined MIB in 1962. However, in MIB3 when J jumps back to 1969, Agent K has completely forgotten his girlfriend and is hung up on a fellow agent who later becomes his boss. Also in the first movie, K had a taste for Elvis and the Beatles, in this one he all of a sudden prefers cowboy music.Another oddity in this film is that J has a photo of Frank the pug hanging over his bed. This seems to be completely out of character for him.The first two movies seemed to be more about getting rid of the bad element and preserving harmony between humans and aliens on Earth. This movie in past and present elements seemed to be more about kill as many aliens as you possibly can.Historically speaking, in 1969 a black man would not have been high ranking in the US military with white men answering to him.This will be one Men In Black I will not be adding to my collection.",Null,2,5,3 February 2013
