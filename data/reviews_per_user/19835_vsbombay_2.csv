Moneyball," Beyond Baseball: Story about success and life
","Excellent Movie.I had no clue what the movie was about, except that it starred Brad Pitt. Had I known it was about Baseball, I probably would have waited to see it on DVD, as my knowledge about the sport is practically zero. I wouldn't confess that I know more about the sport now, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Moneyball may be based in the realms of American Baseball, but the movie goes well beyond that. On a meta note, the movie captures the notion of 'success' and 'failure' that society brands on individuals. In fact, if you have ever questioned what success means, this movie is for you.Brad Pitt does a fantastic job as the GM of the team. He gets into the role remarkably well, and very soon his glamorous personality is forgotten as he molds into the life of an overworked, under-appreciated team manager who is dealing with his own demons while trying to achieve success for his team.The movie has its funny moments when Jonah Hill, who plays the assistant GM, lights up the screen with his intellect, wit, and innocence. His performance is critical to the film and helps lighten the mood.On the whole, it is a great movie, which leaves one in a good mood, and makes one holistically reflect on things that are important in life.",Null,0,1,24 September 2011
Friends with Benefits," Absolute Entertainer
","I went to the movie with no expectations, and was thoroughly entertained. A laugh riot from the get go! A very funny movie that deals with dating, friends, relationships, and sex.The audience broke into laughter several times throughout the movie--clearly bits and pieces of the movie resonated with one and all.Performances by the actors was great--there was spontaneity, chemistry, and awesome screen presence. And of course, NYC is at its best. One cannot help but fall in love with the characters as they walk in Central Park or gush through Times Square.It is a light hearted movie that makes you feel good about life!",10,2,11,24 July 2011
