The Blair Witch Project," horrible movie
","This movie really sucks.  It wasn't scaring at all.  I have been more scared by Kool-Aid commercials.  You know the one where the Kool-Aid man just busts up through someone's wall.  If I had a camcorder and $35,000, I could make something a lot better than this piece of crap.",3,0,1,16 September 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Inferior to FOTR and Tolkien
","***Possible spoilers throughout***The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the greatest adventure/fantasy movies ever, The Two Towers is not.  The liberties taken with the book in translating it to the big screen are numerous, pointless, and damaging. There is no tension, no character development (Gimli is simply there for comic relief; he even axes an orc in the crotch, that never gets old), and no single rousing performance (with the notable exception of the CGI-generated Gollum/Smeagol).  The battle of Helms Deep is convoluted, unsuspenseful, and ridiculous, and Arwen seemed to be thrown into the movie to try and create a strong female lead (and something of a love triangle) where there wasn't one in the book.  Other things (e.g. the oiliphants) were included almost as if Jackson were going down a list checking things off before moving on to the next disappointment.  Where the book contained suspense, insightful dialogue, and yes, humor, Jackson has substituted some inferior jargon meant only to fluff the audience into thinking that this is somehow a masterpiece.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.",8,0,0,23 December 2002
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Don't buy the hype.
","Don't get me wrong this film is not totally useless.  The final ten minutes of the movie are extremely visceral and deeply moving.  But sitting through an hour and a half of sodomy and scatology is not easy to do.  I tried to like this movie, I really did.  But the content is so abhorrent, and presented with little or no artistic merit (aside from a few scenes), that it was really hard to find any redeeming qualities at all.  Is this movie an anti-Fascism masterpiece?  No. Is it just outlandish sensationalism?  Yes and no.  Pasolini shows a little brillance with the torture sequence at the end, but other than that this movie smells about as bad as the main course served for a feast in the film.  Just my two cents of course.  Go see it yourself, come back and prove me wrong.  3/10",2,3,12,6 September 2001
Windtalkers," really bad
","This movie is bad beyond words.  There really is no discernable plot, just 135 minutes of stuff blowing and people getting shot.  I thought it was never going to end, and when it finally did end, I knew nothing more about any of the characters or about the code, just that it was never broken.  If you like lots of violence with no story, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay away from this completely forgettable war film.",4,0,0,18 June 2002
Gladiator," Better than Spartacus!
",This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The acting is top notch and the story couldn't be better.  Some of the best fight scenes ever. Right up there with Apocalypse Now as the best historical fiction movie ever.  A perfect ten!,9,0,0,16 September 2000
