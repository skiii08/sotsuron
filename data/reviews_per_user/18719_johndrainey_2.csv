It," Movie for prepubescent kids
","I thought I was going to watch a horror movie but all I got was a bunch a kids running around with a soon to be menstruating chic. Along with the obligatory group of 4 bullies, a very boring, oh so seen it 20 times before movie.Where do they get the money to make this stuff. Beats me.",1,2,6,30 October 2017
Wonder Woman," History rewritten
","I know Hollywood loves money and will do anything to make it but how low can it go? Having ladies dash around at the beginning with mild French accents and skimpy tunics is fair enough but an English spy with an American accent, come on.To rewrite history for such a silly plot takes it so far from reality it limits the audience age group to 6 or less. Mind you I know a few 6 year olds who would roll their eyes.",1,17,38,17 July 2017
