Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat
","Best freaking movie of 2006!!!!! A hilarious movie where Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen), a Kazahkstani News Reporter makes his way to Los Angeles from New York to meet his love, Pamela Anderson. The movie starts off in Kazahkstan. Then, Borat and his parter, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) go to New York to start filming him and Borat discovers Pamela Anderson while suddenly watching an episode of Baywatch. Then Borat and Azamat make their way to LA stopping at a ranch to get a bear for their guard, a rodeo in Washington DC, a Bed N' Breakfast with old Jewish owners, a dinner party where Borat later meets up with his prostitute, and of course a Pamela Anderson autograph signing at Virgin Records. There are too many funny parts that I could not stop laughing.",10,1,12,18 November 2006
