"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Simon Pegg is enjoyable once more.
","I really, really liked this movie a lot more than I imagined I would. As you can tell from my title, I enjoy every movie that stars Pegg. He is very funny in this movie, he really has the ability to make a movie that is light and still very entertaining. He is natural at playing the character who has to persevere through a situation to reach his goal that seems so easily attainable for another person (Azaria in this case). There are good dramatic aspects with him winning back his love and being an excellent father throughout the course of the movie, save for a few slip-ups. It warms your heart while also making you laugh out loud at how naturally comedic Pegg can be. This is one that I have already watched multiple times and will definitely own one day. Overall, 8/10.",8,1,2,15 July 2013
3:10 to Yuma," Enjoyable western film
","I enjoy western films, mainly newer ones and this is a pretty decent one. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale both are enjoyable to watch as Crowe portrays a quiet, but ruthless leader of a small gang of outlaws while Bale is a simple rancher trying to make ends meat. There was a decent amount of action and gun play in the film and a couple characters being especially well trained at it as usual there is. The deeper story throughout is pretty decent and makes you feel for the characters. It is not the best that I have seen of this genre but with a pretty good story and Crowe and Bale having good performances this a decently enjoyable film that I could watch again.",7,1,2,8 July 2013
The Fast and the Furious," Pretty good high intensity movie
","I had never seen any of the fast and furious films before I just watched this one recently and had heard from some friends that they were absolutely amazing! I finally decided to watch the 1st one and see what it was all about. Brian O' Connor is a cop who is sent undercover into the street racing world to bust some crooks who have been stealing millions of dollars worth of electronics to pay for their extremely fast (and furious) cars. I enjoyed watching it but it was not a jump and amaze me completely movie. I enjoyed how Brian O' Connor was not revealed to be a cop until around 30 minutes or so into the movie. It made you feel for him that much more as he tried to gain respect in the hard undercover world of street racing. The races were very high intensity and fun to watch, even if I do not know hardly anything about cars. Vin Diesel has since lost his appeal but he was great as the big bad leader of the street racing team around him. Overall, 7/10.",7,3,4,11 July 2013
Django Unchained," Tarantino good as usual.
","Django is definitely a true Tarantino movie. It has some similarities to Inglorious Basterds, Waltz plays a similar character in both films. Django is a slave who is rescued by King Schultz, a former dentist now bounty hunter. He soon learns that Django's wife is at another plantation in Mississppi and he tells Django to work with him through the winter and make good money then he will assist Django is rescuing his wife. Tarantino is all over this movie, with good comedic moments and extremely bloody and violent fight scenes. It also has those scenes of extended dialogue known to Tarantino. I did not enjoy this movie as much as Tarantino, mostly because the violence in this movie is much more gruesome in my opinion and I simply like the 1940s time period better. The amount of very bloody violence turned my rating south somewhat, especially the dog scene and the two slaves fighting when Django and Schultz first meet Mrs. Candie. Those scenes were quite disturbing. On the other hand, Waltz's performance is phenomenal as usual. He is very entertaining to watch, always making every scene much more entertaining. The long dialogues could get boring, but he keeps them interesting. Foxx is also pretty good and so is Dicaprio. It is a rather long film, but keeps you entertained as to not notice the movie being that long. Overall 8/10.",9,1,5,14 August 2013
Super 8," Pretty good film, enjoyed it overall.
","Super 8 is about a group of kids in the late 70s who love horror films and are attempting to make their own zombie film. I really got into the kid characters and loved the adventure and imagination they all shared in making their own small movie. While I was very young when movies like The Goonies and The Sandlot came out, I do remember them. I see a lot of people comparing this to those movies and saying how it does not do Spielberg justice after they grew up with those kid adventure/coming of age movies. I remember those movies but was too young for them to have any big significance in my life so maybe that is why I love that aspect of Super 8. The ending is also another complaint of many and while it is nothing special it was just fine to me. There were a few problems I had with it, such as the teacher surviving the head-on collision with the train and maybe the wreck being worse than it might be if that happened in real life. Overall, I had an enjoyable time watching this film, feeling like I was there with those kids and on that great adventure. 8/10.",8,0,1,10 July 2013
Taken 2," Not terrible itself, but is when compared to the first.
","The first Taken movie is excellent in every way, it builds up to its climax nicely and the climax itself is very satisfying after all Mills goes through. Taken 2 is very rushed in that aspect. It is barely 90 minutes long and by the time Mills and his wife are taken, it seems a very short time before the credits are rolling. Some more problems I had were that it was centered around Mills and his wife being taken and not the daughter but Mills is taken for about 10 minutes and then escapes easily. His daughter was working on trying to pass her driving test back in the states after having failed it multiple times, so naturally she could drive a stick-shift like a pro huh?I give it a 6 because it is somewhat fun to watch despite the flaws I have with it. Liam Neeson is always good and seeing him whip up on some bad guys in a foreign country is enjoyable. Overall, 6/10.",6,0,0,15 July 2013
