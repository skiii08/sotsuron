Alien 3," I thought it was F'ing great!
","This movie has gotten a lot of negative reviews. But you you know what? I loved it! I have it on DVD and watch it occasionally.The whole premise, dark atmosphere, etc., different looking Alien and how it/they adapted to this planet, etc. I like it! It was hard that newt died, etc., but that was part of this story. I can see how it might have less of a mass appeal. And maybe how James Cameron made the amazing Aliens movie (one of the best movies of all time), and people expected the same momentum.It's also certainly more in the spirit of the first two rather then the following sequel. If you haven't seen it yet. Watch it, enjoy and be your own judge.",7,8,9,28 April 2010
Fury," Hollywar II, Crazywood
","Starts out pretty interesting. Captivating for a while.It's 'okay, see this?', 'war really sucks'. Okay, got that. About 60% was this gritty in your face war reality thing. Probably a little over the top. Okay get on with it already!The part about the German armor being superior, understood. That scene with the Sherman's fighting the Tiger looked like a reenactment from a documentary I saw. Then all of the sudden, the movie took a weird turn that can only happen in Hollywood fantasy land. Went totally surreal, and partially turned into a 70's style Nazi revenge movie.Didn't anyone notice with the German column that about every third solider was carrying a panzerfaust (German anti-tank rocket) over their shoulder. What a continuity/story error! When the German's arrive they are noticeably missing them. I guess on the way they neatly packed them into crates because the commander says 'sneak these over and shoot that tank, this is all we have left!'. On top of that there were what looked like at least a dozen of them.Really? The Panzerfaust were not like the crappy British PIAT spring launcher models. One would have been enough through the back of a standing still tank (even one PIAT).Actually the whole thing was crazy nonsense at this point. It's a static (not moving) Sherman tank, the men on foot surely could have moved out of the way of the slow rotating turret as they were close and could have avoided the limited arc of the front gun. Apparently these were stereotypical 'dumb' Germans that thought it would be better to run directly into the path of the machine guns instead.Way to go to kill a movie guys! It's like whom ever wrote this movie ran out of ideas and just gave up with a big heaping handful out of the bag of nonsense, stereotypes, and clich√©s. I felt insulted; as if everyone was pushed into the sub-moronic IQ level.It's too bad, I really wanted to like this movie. I'll give it some points though for still being entertaining at times.",6,6,14,30 November 2014
This Is the End," End of humanity, if this is the standard
","Obviously this was meant to be some kind of spoof on disaster movies.What they thought was funny was mostly, actually, crude and crass. There was for example way to many direct drug scenes and references. Apparently, the makers of this movie where in a drug induced haze for the most of it's creation.A lot of weird, supposedly straight, sexual innuendos and overt scenes that don't come off right since it's mostly dudes interacting (specifically, missing the female element to make sense). Revolting, and nausea inducing. Does everything really need to be so explicit to the last detail? Maybe for some people, but it's just not that funny, nor entertaining.All of the baloney, lack of any real writing, and almost no story to speak off, doesn't add up to any kind of movie you'ed want to watch. In the end the plan seems to be that you have to be majorly stoned to like this movie..",3,7,15,15 October 2013
About Time," More love story then anything else
","Reading the IMDb synopsis on the movie I was intrigued by the concept thinking it might be more sci-fi about time travel. But it turned out this was a minimal ingredient for what turns out to be a human interest story and more so a mushy love story.Not that this is bad necessarily, but I was hoping to see some cool sci- time travel concepts.Over all the main actor seems to pull it off pretty well. And there is a bevy of cute girls with nice jobs as well.If you are male just keep in mind this in more of a movie that you will want to watch with your girlfriend to get in a chick-flick quota..",6,1,5,3 January 2014
Youth," Too abstract
","Didn't know what to expect with this movie, but hey it had Michael Caine so I had to give it a go.Obviously, it's an art film. That is pretty obvious right away. That being said, I don't like art films. Or rather, pompous films cry out 'Hey I'm an art film!'. Now Stanley Kubrick's are mostly art films but they are not pretentious. His movies are art in their delivery, not an art grandstand like this one.The only saving grace were the titillating female nude scenes. But even then that was a little over the top, felt as if it was some kind of cheap exploit for lack of real story or substance.Maybe it was trying to poke fun at the pretensions of Hollywood and/or of film making in general. Sort of laughing at ones self kind of thing. At any rate I found it too abstract and for the most part a waste of time, talent, and a bore.Your better off going back and watching one of Micheal Caine's classics. Don't waste your time.",4,2,3,9 August 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Not another art film
","I don't get it.
The movie started out interesting but took some very strange turns.
I realized it was so supposed some kind of parody, deliberately being over the top and non-nonsensical.In the end I just didn't get it and didn't have the patients for it.
Maybe it's a movie that appeals to some people, but thought it was garbage.",1,7,11,5 August 2018
Gone Baby Gone," Gone, baby don't!
","Terrible, it would have been a mediocre movie at best, if it were not for some illogical points in the 'story' and bad acting on the part played by Casey Affleck.Now here is the spoiler in the next few lines. If you really do want to see this movie (trust me you don't), then read this after you've seen it.. This movie started out pretty raw and it does tug at your heart strings since it has issues with kids in it. At first I thought it was some sort of shock movie. One of those for lack of a better story, pushing the sock value (you've seen them before).I got to hand one thing to Ben. First time I was left watching a detective story thinking that the protagonist was a total frigging idiot! Give me Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade! This guy is a 'detective' with an IQ of a rock.The story has a few holes it in that make it fall apart. It got worse and worse about 3/4 into the movie.#1 He just shot the pedophile killer in the head and killed him. I didn't shed any tears for the guy, okay the guy deserved it. But then it doesn't explain how he got away with this murder. It left me thinking that 'okay, they must have made up a story with Remy to make it all self defense..'.Then the movie reaches it denouement, thinking there was some terrible conspiracy for money, only to find that the bad guys were not so bad after all. Then the detective does what does not make any sense at all, and gives up the child back to the drug addict mother. Just after the three cops basically gave up their careers, two of them their lives (one directly), not to mention several other people that either lied or gave up $130k in interest of the child. Makes even less sense, when he commits murder in a previous scene and gets away with it, but then he's morally inclined to take the child way from new loving adoptive (albeit illegal) parents. Not to mention sending the good retired Chief and wife to prison.. And then a few more final scenes that points out that he was even more of an idiot, and that what other people were telling him.Now all of this nonsensical line would have made sense (every movie need not have a 'happy ending' after all), but Casey Affleck just didn't bring it. Just maybe, it would have made some sort of melodramatic sense if he could have pulled it off right.No offense to the other reviewers, but Ben must have paid them well.I'm off to watch 'The Maltese Falcon' to wash the bad taste out of my mouth before I pluck my eyes out after watching this movie..",3,29,55,31 December 2007
Rush," Great!
","As of my little review here the movie as been out for about a year.Normally I'm not a big fan of the car racing genre, although I did like 'Days of Thunder', 'Le Mans' and some others. And I didn't think about it at the time it was Ron Howard directed.I'm glad I got around to give this movie a view. It was excellent! Much more of a just 'racing movie', much of a 'human interest' type movie as well. Makes me wish back when I was a young lad I paid more attention to formula racing back in 1976'ish.The bottom line is even if you are not a big fan of racing you will probably really appreciate this movie and love it.",9,2,3,18 August 2014
Divergent," Potter + Twilight + Hunger Games + Harlequin Romance = Vomit
","My title summons up my feeling for this movie.I could tell in the first 15 minutes I was going to hate it. But wife wanted to see it so I had to sit through it, plus I thought 'okay maybe somewhere maybe this movie might improve'..it never did.The worst problem I had with it was it was way too fantasy, unbelievable. Like from the start: So they run along this train..then you see 'oh, whew just in time!', yea right!If you are a person who knows anything about anything you will see there are just to many holes in this. Example if you know anything about trapeze arts you know you must land on the net just the right way (not on your head, or feet first, etc.) else you would probably end up crippled or even killed.Then anyone who knows anything about martial arts would see this so called advanced fighting technique of the future laughable. For that matter if you have the slightest understanding of physics you'ed see a lot of stuff happening improbable, if not downright impossible. And then shouldn't there be bodies all over the place with such reckless abandon? I could go on and on, it's like the writer(s) of this movie were in some sort of hallucinogenic stupor while they wrote it. The key parts of the story they seemed to have 'borrowed' from other trendy stories like the first book of Harry Potter, the Twilight concept, and a fair bit of Hunger Games thrown in.Also the whole movie is very stereotyped and predictable. You could literally see what was going to happen a mile away.Finally that literally got me nauseated was the way over the top dramatic and sappiness of it. Somewhere between the worst soap opera and some sort of teenaged 'reality' show. I'm pretty sure this story was geared for teenage girls, or otherwise I'm not sure what they were thinking.In the end my wife liked it (whom is not a teenager by the way), but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other then a 14 year old girl..I got to stop thinking and writing about this movie before I hurl..",4,0,1,26 July 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," One of the best movies ever
","Coming into this movie I didn't know what to expect. Other then the trailers which looked great, it could have been another superhero movie mess like the 'Green Lantern' (2011), and while 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014) was good, it was fairly forgettable.Now this movie was pure awesomeness!An excellent movie all around, very entertaining. In particular being around in the 70's and 80's and a lover of cinema, I loved all the music and little movie references.For the first time in a while I was lost in a movie, loosing sense of time, just enjoying it for what it was.Everything about it excellent, from the story to production, etc. Well done for all those that were involved with it's production!Go see it ASAP!",10,4,9,3 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Excellent!
","Easily one of the best movies I've seen seen in at least a year or two.I checked the 'spoiler' box just to be safe, but most people probably have heard a lot of the details of Alan Turing already.I knew a lot of Alan Turing and Bletchley Park et al, from many documentaries and, or, dramatizations about him and the Enigma machine, etc. But this was so finally done it had many more dynamics. Certainly the best dramatization movie thus far.For one thing the neat relationship to the woman that was his wife (despite him being homosexual). Incidentally whom I'm sure was a brilliant woman but frankly Joan Clarke doesn't look at all like Keira Knightley; but then that's the movies for you.Then what really struck me, was here this guy was Gay okay. It was different times back then. In England it was even a high crime. But in perspective you think about what he did, for at least the few people in government that knew what he did; out of how many lives the guy is directly responsible for saving..maybe millions?, they couldn't leave him alone.He was persecuted and publicly humiliated to the point where he commuted suicide at a relatively young age. This guy with all this courage, and the people that knew what he did for the country hadn't even a modicum of the same courage to stand up for the guy. He was clearly in this day one of the best war hero's of WW2.And if this wasn't tragic enough, one can only imagine what his work would have produced if he were not persecuted to death. We might have had personal computers by at least the 60's (vs the late 70's), etc.Also all the actors did excellent performances, the production value was very high, etc., about as perfect a movie as you would expect these days.A fine movie everyone should see, in particular to learn lessons of history..",10,5,13,11 January 2015
Steve Jobs," Unnecessary, rehash, tried, redundant, pointless..
","The movie hit the online provider circuit so I thought I'd give it a shot. I sat through about 15 minutes of wondering what was I watching, looking for something entertaining or new; for that matter what the hell it was even about..Looks like it should have been some short stage play called 'A day with Jobs' (giving it a lot more credit than it should).It only serves to ask 'Why another Jobs movie'?I like Michael Fassbender but he looks nothing, nor talks, nor acts like Jobs.Even the Ashton Kutcher version is better.Really there is no, nor ever was a reason for this movie to exist - redundant, unnecessary, tired, rehashed, just pointless.If you want to experience something entertaining and historic see the classic 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' TV movie. It's the best Steve Jobs movie (along with a Bill Gates tie-in).If you want to know about the real Steve Jobs and Apple history et al, read Job's autobiography, then Steve Woznia's autobiography 'iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon'.Skip this one, it's a complete waste of time..",2,3,7,25 September 2016
Dark Shadows," Loved it! See it!
","First, I didn't really expect so much from this movie. I had some expectations, some preconceived ideas, maybe it was a spoof of the old Dark Shadows TV show? Which I only vaguely remember as I was just a kid at the time. My impression was it was kind of a soap opera with Vampires.I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was way entertaining beyond all my expectations.I really do love movies, although not necessarily all of Tim Burton's. And not even so sure he 'made' it. He directed it, but JD produced it so I don't know. I liked 'Corpse Bride' but didn't care much for his Batman, and some of his others. But here, this movie was spot on in the genre!I haven't liked a dark creepy movie like this since Peter Jackson's 'The Frighteners' (a classic in it's own right), and it minded me a bit of those fun 'Adams Family' movies.Johnny Dep Vampire was so compelling, interesting, and just humorously perfect creepy.Now if it has much to do with the original Dark Shadows series, if I missed some spoofs, or inside jokes, I honestly could care less. I doubt it even matters unless you are a 55+ plus that really remembers the old show (and nothing wrong with that either). For pure entertainment value it kicked some serious A'! See it, enjoy, you might love it as I do.",8,2,7,2 September 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdbrain
","Okay I get it, some kind of art film.I guess I'm just your average, run of the mill, unsophisticated bloke. Not a whine tasting, cheese sniffing, artiste folie de grandeur..so I didn't feel the finer art of this movie.Sorry don't be fooled, the Emperor is indeed naked; this movie is flat out boring. I found this movie to be some sort of over dramatic soap opera. It was way too drawn out, just mildly entertaining. I do like the actors and the overall production was good. It was the whole concept/story that was bad.I wish I could get my hour back (until I got that 'WTF is this?' feeling) and watched something else instead..",4,6,13,11 January 2015
The Purge," Excellent! A new horror/thriller classic
","Didn't know what to expect as all I knew it was a 'horror' movie. And so good, it blew me away!It's really a cut above any thing in the horror, even more so in the thriller genre that I've seen in quite awhile.The best thing about it? It really had a story, a real concept to it. The whole movie finely done was an excellent carrier-wave for interesting messages.At first I thought the concept just another 'what if?', but then the idea started to permeate my psyche and it really hit me. Expletive, expletive!, Yea wow!, what if say this really happened? And to say the very least it rattled my nerves. I was on the edge of me seat the whole movie.I haven't seen anything with this kind of spirit and edge since 'Assault on Precinct 13' 1976 (not 2005 remake). The 2005 version was okay, but you have really have to see the 1976 version to appreciate it. Another classic movie in the same spirit is 'Westworld' 1973, and the edge of 'The Andromeda Strain' 1969.Has a sort of John Carpenter-ish feeling. It wasn't that surprising the director, James DeMonaco, also made the 'Assault on Precinct 13' 2005 version! He's one of my favorite directors now, I'm definitely looking forward to 'The Purge 2' and what ever else in the future.I was pretty surprised this movie has such a low score by some other reviewers. It's obvious what I think, but here is the thing: The message, the idea, might offend some people. Perhaps to a greater or lessor degree reflect on their own feelings/ideas/beliefs on society, morals, religion, etc. Questions like: Are people basically evil, or are they good? (I believe the later). Better works of art (what ever mediums including cinema) have this two way communication quality to them. You sort of look back at what you see and experience. Probably, possibly, this was a little to far for some people. Don't be deterred as in the end the stats don't lie. Looking here on IMDb I see this movie has actually done pretty well at the box office, and they are making a sequel too!If you like horror, thrillers, a thinking person's movie, or just great movie entertainment at it's finest, see this!",8,0,3,2 July 2013
Godzilla," Entertaining, but obviously could have been much better..
","Having been a fan of Godzilla and in general monster movies (like the 'Gamera' ones et al) I was really looking forward to this incarnation. Recalling back to the pre-internet, before DVD - even before VHS, days..you had to meticulously comb your local 'TV guide' for a chance to see once of these late night or early morning weekends.Now over all I found it pretty entertaining, but had a lot of holes in it where it probably could have been much better.First the movie sort felt like it took it self too seriously. Maybe the idea here was to capture the essence of 1956 (USA) version. Where you are sort of a bystander to the story, seeing it from a third-person point of view.To it's credit it captured other parts of the spirit of the movies like where the in the progression of the originals Godzilla is the hero. Also the acting and choice of actors was well, except I don't feel Ken Watanabe was the best role for a 'Dr. Serizawa'. In the original Serizawa hard this dark, sort of maniacal edge to him. After all he was some sort of scientific genius, and thus would be geeky/nerdy, with that weird edge you would expect.Where I think the movie ultimately fails to it's potential was too much of this third-person view. In all of the Godzilla movies I've seen (most if not all of them) more of the focus was on the fights and interactions of monsters. It was one of the thrilling parts. Even being limited by the SFX technology of the time (rubber suits, detailed miniatures, etc.) one of the more interesting aspects. In this movie very downplayed.Also part of the Godzilla experience was about character. You could see Godzilla had this personality, human like emotions, etc. He showed intelligence other then say just animalistic. Severally lacking in this movie.Finally another classic part of the formula this movie misses out on is Godzilla's interaction and affinity for children. In some of the movies you would see a young (in the 8 to 12 year old range) boy talk with and be be bonded buddies. It connected this kind of special understanding, sincerity, and innocence of the child's point of view. A connecting of fantasy and reality and adding more of a personal/human touch.As I write this I feel more and more that the creator's vision of this movie was fairly out of tune with what is/was really great about Godzilla. As if they should have studied more and could have consulted fans of the originals for advice, etc..In the end is was entertaining and worth watching!",6,2,3,28 August 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Lowbrow, crass, sophomoric, yet still entertaining..
","Just got back from the theater seeing this movie. Over all it was pretty entertaining, yet kind of let down too. I really wished I chose the other one that had Liam Neeson in it.It started out pretty well, but like most movies these days they feel they have to push it over the top.I think they were going for some kind of humorous feel, a bit of a spoof at parts, but it ended up feeling kind dirty and tasteless. It felt like instead of making a more quality story they went for the cheap thrills with a lot of four letter words, violence, and needless sexual overtones.In one particular scene it was non-stop over the top violent. I don't know what they were going for but everyone in the theater seemed to get tense. We were all wondering what the hell we just saw. Was this supposed to be funny or dramatic?And in the James Bond films (which this movie tries to spoof at points) the sex scenes are sort of implied, good enough, but this one became weird. Several people, mainly ladies, walked out on the film early.Over all fairly entertaining, but felt kind of cheapened by attempts to make it too edgy and contemporary..",6,1,7,21 March 2015
Her," To obvious
","First of all before the shills down vote my review.. I thought it was odd that all the highest rated reviews were at the top then all the mid to low score reviews are pushed towards the end do to unusual voting counts. It looks as though someone(s) are trying to manipulate the review for this movie.I've read what must have been hundreds of written over a dozen reviews here my self and this is the first time I've seen such an obvious pattern for a movie review here.Whomever is responsible for this, assuming you are part of this movie, you would want an all around honest review wouldn't you?. Not a manipulated one. No one learns anything if you want to view everything through your rose colored glasses and it isn't fair for people that pay to see your movie(s), the IMDb reader, etc.Now that being said, my own honest and unbiased review:Overall I thought the movie to be pretty interesting. Something fairly new, different, and thought-provoking at points.But where the movie falls flat is that the message(s) of it were just too obvious and implicit. Instead of just letting the story flow and let points be smoothly conveyed through an interesting story it had to be shoved in your face. At times to a point were I felt I was being preached too. Okay I get it. I really don't need everything so obviously pointed out ad nauseum!If more emphasis was on the actual movie, less on the 'moral(s) of the story' then it probably would have been a lot more interesting. Examples where this is done much better is 'Minority Report' 2002, and ' A.I. Artificial Intelligence' 2001.",6,11,27,10 January 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Feels a bit like the old Max, but disappointing
","I'm old enough to have caught all the original Mad Max movies when they hit the silver screen here in America.It was entertaining but I felt sort of let down. I expected more of original formula. As much as I like Tom Hardy in other movies, he honestly couldn't carry the Mad Max character. Then they tried to make up for it with some weird horror like montage/flashbacks. I got the feeling this 'Max' had either gone insane or maybe he was on some serious drugs.Mel has this sort of spark to him. His version was much stronger, more masculine, sort of like a superhero. Harding on the other hand seemed weak and kind of mushy.I'm starting to feel that Gibson would have been better again despite his age. Sure maybe he couldn't crawl under a truck anymore, but Arnold and Stallone carry an action movie fine and they are even older!It did have the Mad Max feel to it at times, but for the most part it seemed to have a lot more of the modern feel. Unfortunately this time Miller must have been wooed and couldn't resist the temptation to over do special effects like 90% of most action movies are these days. I'll say it again, and again, if you don't have story you don't have anything.Does every movie need to be one and half hours plus of pure SFX? It got to a point were the movie seemed too implausible and surreal.And then it seems like Miller was thinking 'screw it, I'm going to make this movie really mean something!'; and make this weird dynamic about some political statements all over. Miller seemed have gotten soft in the head. The originals were like 'Watch this wild strong guy try to survive in some apocalyptic wasteland' and that was all we needed.This move just doesn't have that magic. The original Max really had this edge to it. And it had a lot of character.In the end it's a pretty entertaining movie, but like me you'll probably leave a bit disappointed if you were a big fan of the originals..",6,13,43,14 May 2015
The Social Network," Great! Don't even have to be a Facebook fan to like it.
","I didn't know what to expect with this movie. In particular because similar movies in the same vein have almost always been bad so I was a bit jaded coming in.But this movie was a charm! The flow of it was excellent. Although it probably appeals to a wide audience, I felt it's very much a computer person's movie.The acting was great, the directing, everything was great.Frankly I don't care about Facebook. I don't waste time on it, and in my opinion putting all these personal details about your self anyone can just find you by name is just foolish.I've been involved in some underground, and, or, otherwise start-up operations and this really captured the excitement and feeling of it. And also like the movie in one of those biz adventures I've gotten screwed (although minuscule in comparison). The moral of the story is, always get stuff down on paper! The fact that so many businesses die before they even get started, starting things are so often so causal, etc. And then when money comes into play so do politics, greed, etc. If the Winklevoss brothers et al really thought they had something it seems to me if they would have Zuckerberg sign some sort of NDA first, or some kind of non-competition agreement, etc., they would be the 60% owners not Zuckerberg.A good companion to this move is 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' (look it up here on IMDb). See the parallel? It's like Mark Zuckerberg was the Bill Gates of the social networking world! In this case the Winklevoss team was Apple Computer. Ironically Gates was a speaker at Harvard in the movie.",10,0,2,21 November 2010
