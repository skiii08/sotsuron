First Man," A Masterpiece.
","A great film that doesn't show an untouchable hero, but a mourning husband and dad, who has lost his daughter. 'First Man' didn't focus on America or the incredible work that has been done by the Americans. It focuses on the human Neil Armstrong, the 'First Man'. So don't hate the film for not showing how they sticked the American Flag into the Moon surface because that's not what this film is about.
It simply isn't a patriotic hymn to the American technology, but a biography of a special person who had the privilege to be the first person to walk on the moon.
And I think that this film truly is a great biography of Neil Armstrong.
Go watch it and if you're American, for one time acknowledge art as it is and don't criticize everything that doesn't suit you.",10,2,7,15 December 2018
La La Land," I can't get enough of this movie!!!
","I don't know what Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz pured over this movie but since I first watched this piece of Art I've been hooked.
I must admit that at first I thought this is a totally overrated movie but I was curious on finding that out.
Now after 4 Times watching it in 3 months since Christmas 2017 I can Tell you:
Go and WATCH it. you will certainly Not regret it!",10,3,4,18 March 2018
