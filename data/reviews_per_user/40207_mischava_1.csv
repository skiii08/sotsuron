The Incredible Hulk," whywhywhywhywhy
","WHY??DID??THEY??MAKE??THIS?? This movie is BS and should never have been made, it doesn't stick to the comic at all, and the 'nice' connections to make us believe like Mr. McGee (from TOS) and the piano music when he's hitchhiking (again) aren't fooling me one bit. The storyline is boring, flat and simple, The relationship between the characters gave me the idea to watch another attempt of big egos who think they can do better. If you make fantasy, keep it credible. Extinguishing a kerosene fire by slapping hands... Even in this kind of crap it looks ridiculous and very unconvincing. Ang Lee's Hulk came quite close to the original idea, as is to see on the credit-list, there were some die-hard Marvel guys at work there. This is just a list of supposedly big names, who f''''Ã©d up an already proved-to-be-great story. (Accounting the millions of readers) And what the hell is Abomination doing in here? If that's really him, because my sleepy fellows, ABOMINATION IS ALSO GREEN! He arrived a quite different way than the comic wrote, he shouldn't show it's ugly face for years. This movie is an insult to the cast and crew from the 2003 version, and to us die hard hulk fans. I've been collecting Hulk comics from 1977, so I'm spoiled, I know, but this production I'll consider never being made, and stick to Ang Lee and Eric Bana's version who made THE ONE AND ONLY HULK MOVIE!",4,2,5,11 July 2008
