Black Swan," Black Swan, clichéd, and too long
","Hello film fanatics,I must start by saying, this film had great camera work, excellent acting, by Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and especially Barbara Hershey, for playing a controlling psychotic mother.With this being said the reason for my low rating is because it kind of drags on and on, yes I understand that Portman's character obviously has some issues with her marbles upstairs, mainly because of her controlling mother. And this is why this film didn't work for me. This kind of story has been done to death, from films such as Hitchcock's Psycho with the whole mother/Norman personality, David Lynch's Mullholland Dr. having the fake reality and also lesbian scenes (Which was filmed more elegant by Lynch than the director of this film.) Texas Chainsaw Massacre with the whole crazy family thing going on, and Raising Cain with John Lithgow which is another Psycho style film in itself.Why I'm mentioning these films,well it's because films like these they all have one thing in common,and that's the whole parental conditioning, also like Mullholland Dr.,the whole fake world kind of thing, through some kind of everyday environmental pressures coming from society. In this film I found it had little hints from films like that. I understand that taking great ideas from another film that you love, is a normal thing, and kind of hat's off to all the wonderful films from the past, but like I've said I'm just so bored of this kind of story, that's all. I really don't want to see another psychological crazy mental breakdown film again, we have enough already. And that's why I rated this film the way I did.Also the whole lesbian fantasy between Portman and Kunis, well that is really nothing shocking and nothing I haven't seen before, it just seemed like they were trying to play the shock value card, and by having an innocent actress such as Portman, that's really what makes the film pop! Or so they think. Let me ask you this, if they had an actress like Sharon Stone who was famous for showing her muffin, in Basic Instinct, would it have been so shocking, and that's my point, instead they showed Portman doing this. I really think that this scene is all this film is going to be remembered for, after time passes us by.I really just think this film was just two hours of ballet, with a little bit of paranoid psychosis, alternate personality syndrome mixed in with it. With this film I find also it's like being on a roller coaster with just one big hill and no little twist's and turns before the end. You stand in the big line up, waiting and anticipating for it to move forward, but nothing does, then after an hour waiting in the boring line up you finally get to go on the ride. Then it's like at the beginning of the ride your going up the hill, getting all intrigued by the character's then you get closer to the top, getting a little bit confused, then you finally reach the top, and then boom! Your flying down the hill, letting all the secrets of the film fly past you. Then the ride stops and it's over. No little twists and turns on the way to the end of the ride.To some it all up this film basically goes like this. A girl is under pressure from her mother and the ballet company, then she get's horny and wants to have sex with a woman but doesn't have the nerve to step outside of her little box of the ballet world and her controlling mother, then she goes nuts thinks she's some form of human/swan creature, and dies due to her mental issues, The End. So I'm just basically saying great acting, great camera work. But just bad writing with no original thought, just the same old 'mental problems' film, with hints of being lesbian. And besides no reputable ballet company would even hire a girl that has such low self confidence, also in the final act where she falls off of the guy who is holding her up, then crashes to the stage, I think the director of the ballet would have her replaced. She seemed to of hit that stage pretty damn hard, and then to go back out and finish the piece in total perfection, come on people, I think if I hit my knee that hard I would be limping around at least slightly, let alone doing ballet. We as an audience don't miss details like this. If you like that sort of thing then it's the film for you, but if you don't then don't watch it. And if you want to watch a decent ballet film then watch Dario Argento's 'Susperia'. It's not the greatest film but in my opinion just a nice well balanced story with great colour, good acting, excellent film work and imagination for it's time.Thanks for reading.",4,0,2,8 April 2011
Skyfall," The Names Bond, Mumbles Bond!
","I was very excited to see a new Bond flick. I went on a Monday so the crowds would be lower, but even still, the theatre was still almost full from with true Bond fans.It started off pretty exciting, with the classic theme in the opening shot. You really didn't know what was happening as Daniel Craig walks down the hallway carrying his PPK. As I moved through this film, I was excited waiting for it to get better, but on the other hand after I got home I decided to write this review.I really liked some of the aspects in this new instalment, but it just doesn't feel like a Bond film to me anymore, the whole serious Bond re-imaged version doesn't do anything for me. I kind of liked Casino Royale, it was a a different take on the franchise, but still, I think the 'Craig's' Bond is a little too dark. Not cheery, silly at times, and exciting like the old films. I love the look of Daniel Craig as Bond, but I just don't like his character's style.I find also that he seems to mumble and talk softly in a deep serious voice, half the time I have to think about what he just said. Everyone else around him speaks clearly, but when he talks, it's like listening to a person covering up their mouth with ones hand.I have seen all Daniel Craig's other films and don't have a problem, but when he plays Bond, all I hear is blah blah Blah Blah blah! The Bond girls didn't feel like Bond girls, the villain Javier Bardem was not too bad, his little virus schemes were pretty cool, but that's also another down turn of this film, you would think the MI6 would be more intelligent in this instalment with the addition of Q, he acts like a computer genius but still doesn't realize that the Virus Hack that triggers all these situations is the fact of tracking the villain, So every time they crack the code something bad happens. You would think they would be more intelligent than this, it's the MI6! In the end I gave it a 2 out of 10, just for the acting, I'd say Quantum of Solace was better, and more entertaining.Kind of sad for the 50th Anniversary. The action scenes were acceptable and entertaining, I had no feelings for the Bond girls, pretty plain and mediocre, Q had nothing to offer, It seemed all mixed up with technology, using prehistoric gadgets with new technology, the ending was also overlapping into the 'Connery' years.I don't feel that this reboot, re-image, whatever you want to call it is a good idea. Daniel Craig is a very great performer, but as Bond, he has the look, but no idea how to be him. I don't think it was his fault, I think that had to do with the writer. I know the original novels were more serious, but that's not the point, they filmed Bond all the way up to Craig's version as a spy that gets the job done, is silly at times, also can be serious.I think that's what the studios want when they first took the novel and put it to film, they wanted something at the time that people would get. This Bond is just drowned out by all the other spy films of late, and will probably be forgotten. The Series has ran out of steam after Brosnan and will never be the same. But they try to re-invent Bond, well why fix something that isn't broke? The credits say 'James Bond will return'. I hope not, this re-image ruined it, and just makes me want to go back and watch the old films.Also a downside is the fact that Bond doesn't save anyone in this film, he just doesn't get the job done. The Bond girl is killed stupidly and M dies. Pointless!",2,13,26,12 November 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Do 3D effects sacrifice the story
","I went to this movie with my girlfriend. I must say, putting up with the idiot teenagers behind me checking their vibrating phones seeing their lighted displays in the corner of my 3D glasses. I still wanted to see this film, I put the rhetoric behind me. The opening of the film was the narration of Alice, once again telling the fans of this series what we already know. It was without a doubt, boring hearing the story already known to us. But i think that the directors wanted to play the people that have never seen the film, only heard about it through gossip. The writers of this film, from what I see just wanted to make a 3D movie with the title called Resident Evil. The first three movies were really good. I know video game goers will knock me on this critique. But as a film buff and not a video game expert. I must say the directors and writers did an excellent job at making the first three films by making video game to movie history. They couldn't of done this without what George A. Romero did back in 1968. Because of technology, and video games, this genre has taken the next step.But I feel the first 8 minutes of this film were great, however, after this, it's just a lost weak version of it's original self, made just to sell some more 3D televisions. Ask yourself, if this movie you seen in 2D as you watched in 3D, is there a story here? Does this film feel like the rest of the series? Or is it just a popular pop phenomenon? Or just to go see a movie, and ask yourself is this just a film made to dazzle our senses with new technology. I must admit that this movie did do all of that. But I must ask again where is the story? That I can't answer. I think that Hollywood is taking us for a ride, so that the new generation will go to the movie theatre, to buy into a monster that is already dead. And that is all they want us to do. Spend money to fill in the years of lack luster entertainment. You see these days the film industry is dying, so now with new technology they have grasp the human race to go see the next new gimmick, just to see the next version of what movies are. Well, with this falsehood in mind, I will say this movie is a pathetic attempt to make money on the original franchise.How sad is this? Alice to me didn't feel like her own-self. With the plagiarist visual effects, and with the ending looking like Terminator verses the Matrix. To me and even the goofy teenagers sitting behind me agreed upon this one thought, where was the story. I listened to them saying, 'that sucked the other movies were way better.' It's pretty sad, even though I'm 33 years old that the 15 year old kids behind me think the same thing.And what was with the crazy zombie carrying the big, huge hammer/axe? Where did he come from? Why is he there? Is he just some lost relic of the S.T.A.R.S.program? I really don't know. All I have to say is where was the story line and why did I feel the 'MEAT' or the middle part of the film drag on too long? I found that the beginning action sequences were good.The middle part did nothing for me except for a few scares. And then the already done MATRIX/TERMINATOR ending. How disappointing.To sum it all up, I was disappointed from watching this film. Hollywood has obviously played a huge prank on us calling this Resident Evil. They paid too much attention to new 3D technology and the story suffered by trying to distract all of us through this 3D effect.Stay far away from this movie, and go home and watch the original films to shake the bugs off, of this disgrace in the story of Resident Evil 4.Also I must add, movies are hard to make. We fans are all critics on how things should be filmed. But these directors ,writers, and all the people that make films come together have been bought out by the newest technology, and they will keep playing this role until it dries up the money train. They have already done this in the past through the mass production of VHS, DVD, and Blueray Disc, which is the same form of DVD except 'They' claim, it's clearer. Hey, kids and movie goers out there, a real movie is something that makes us inspired, not by commercialized effects,but by the story. Real directors take written stories and put that on a visual canvas to make us see what they see. But the films made today are just all about selling the next 3d television. And who do you think owns the rights to these companies? Yes, you guessed it the production companies themselves. A film is, what it is, and nothing more. But when we put money before the true form of film, it suffers. It shouldn't matter what type of television we buy. The film you are watching should present itself as it is. We as a society have been brainwashed by the corporate empire to make us believe that 3D makes a better and more compelling story. But this is false there has to be a story before we use technology to enhance that aspect.",2,14,27,21 September 2010
The Thing," This is how a movie is made
","I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror. He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien. They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr. Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.",10,12,17,18 February 2010
Split," Step For Step Hitchcock Style Nothing New
","Just by watching the trailer for Split, we all know what this film is about. You guessed it, yes that's right, it's multiple personality disorder. Written and directed by the not so famous anymore M. Night Shyamalan, starring James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Hayley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula and Izzie Coffey. The film takes us on the journey of the latest craze, girls taken, and then locked in basements against their will. It's sort of a sado masochism type of film in a way, except it's captor(McAvoy) has many personalities running around, all the while still under supervision of a psychologist.Shyamalan goes through all the predictable steps to make us care about the victims and the villain, we get a surprise ending as to why we have to sit and watch this predictable rubbish, and it's end is just to make the studios buy into Shyamalan's work yet another time, it's all about money to further his venture's for another feature film.Watching the entire film, and after seeing it's final scene, I felt annoyed, and I wouldn't watch this film again. It's the same stunt he pulled with 'Sixth Sense', this type of 'oh wow' would of worked 25 years ago, but not now, society is just too smart for this type of silliness. This director is very cocky in my opinion, he's had a few good movies, but mostly duds, while riding on the coat tails of his so called inspiration Alfred Hitchcock. Copying director style is one thing, but making films with Hitchcock step for step direction is another, that's why Shyamalan to me is a sell out, he's doing it for the money, we all fell for that rhetoric with SIxth Sense and Signs, but those day's are over, and there is more younger director talent out there, and it isn't Shyamalan.",2,77,190,16 February 2017
Insidious," Just what I liked and Disliked, but over all a fun film!
","Now I'm not a famous critic, but this film is just a mix of really awesome scenes from films of the past mixing into a giant blender. But still has an original story, such a strange combination. What a great world we live in! This film seems to imitate classic films like The Exorcist, Amityville Horror, Poltergeist, Wes Craven's A New Nightmare, Yes even Darth Maull from Star Wars.This film actually does have an original story, that is pretty cool! But too bad the director filming this production was thinking on how to make these scenes way over pronounced. But it's still a fun ride. I understand that the DP of this film loves all the films I mentioned above or at least likes them. But he really didn't have to make them so superimposed. Basically we have a great story built on the shoulders of giants, now we all know that this is how great films are made, by borrowing really cool ideas, but really, let's be sensible, you don't have to overdue the filmmakers you love in your own production. This makes your film transparent. The idea of the Further region was really cool but ruined when they turned it into a circus act and theatrical production, they should have made it more gritty with a lot less colour. It was like watching a Technicolor Disney film from the 50's. They should of done the opposite with the colour scheme, and put the colour in the real world and the drab colour in the Further region. Because, when we dream and if there is colour in your dream it's never usually very vibrant. And that's what they didn't remember when making this film.Now on a positive note.....I did like the scare scenes in this even after all the down talk. I'm no film maker, but this review comes from just a fan of thrillers and horror films. But I'll be a man and tell you that I did get scared of the fright scenes they were very effective. This film is actually one of the scarier thrillers I've seen in a while, actually a long while. Being it was from the creators of Paranormal Activity and Saw, that's just a selling point and nothing more. The real talent behind the scares are the writers and DP's if it wasn't for great people like this we wouldn't ever have great scary films. But I'm just pointing out some of the things I liked and didn't like. I may sound a bit harsh. But that's what these reviews by normal everyday people are all about.

2012," A Certain Disgrace to the Intelligence of Movie Goers!
","I just watched this film after about 3 years, I couldn't dare myself to see this, because of all the hype behind it. I sometimes like conspiracy theory films, such as films like the X-Files.This film started out like Independence Day meets The Day After Tomorrow, films that are way better scripted than this. I felt as I watched this I was witnessing great actors such as John Cusack, Oliver Platt, and Danny Glover take a step down from how great they are. I really don't understand how and why they would take this role, I truly do not understand it.On a positive note the special effects were astounding, the only downside was that the effects were tied in with unbelievable writing. We watch Mr. Cusack hire a pilot to avoid the catastrophes, then when they arrive at the airport to take a plane to get away from it all, the pilot is dead or knocked unconscious. Now left to save Cusack's separated family is the new boyfriend of Cusack's now estranged wife to save the day. This man states that he had only a couple of flying lessons, but manages to fly around crashing skyscrapers and flaming balls of molten rock. Wow I wish I was that good! Finally, this film is a great ride if your into unbelievable situations preformed by normal everyday people. If you believe the world should of ended in 2012, then why am I still here in 2013? This was a great money grabber for Hollywood. It had great special effects with a bad script and excellent acting from the main stars. This recipe is destined for a disaster so to speak.The film is filled with American bravery from the President staying with the sinking ship of the United States of America(ya, right), to such laughable scenes of normal people going through the rat race of California streets collapsing around them. I think personally James Bond wouldn't even of survived this madness of a film.The score of the film was below par and done before, the shots of the film we have all seen before, the story seems way too familiar and beaten to death as we view this end of the world scenario. I will never watch this again, and will never recommend it to anyone. What a waste of actor talent and time. Disgusting. 2/10 for me, and the two stars go to the effects people and the actors. The writers should be fired from making any future motion pictures ever again.One last note: When trying to save humanity from the end of the world make sure your you don't drop your drill in the gears of the ocean vessel your trying to save. Because this one thing is the reason why everything could end, all because of one hand held power drill. What a joke! Tears are streaming from my eyes thinking about destroying Hollywood writers. This film is a mess. I also feel bad for Mr. Woody Harrelson, hoping he at least got a good paycheck from this load of cow manure.",2,4,6,14 April 2013
Event Horizon," The Dark Within Us
","I have just watched this movie again and I wanted to write a review on it. It is not a perfect film by any means. But it has a lot of fantasy thinking. The opening score of the film is very energetic with a mix between electronica style music and symphony with dark subtle undertones, it makes you feel that your on the last downward spiral of a really great roller coaster ride. And to ask a question, is the technology in this film based on fact or fiction? When I sit down to watch this movie it makes me believe every time that this kind of space travel might be plausible in the future. It is by any means a simple detective styled film, mixed in with horror and science fiction. An excellent combination by any standards of the film making process.I think this is why the story works for me. The way I look at horror films in general, or any film actually, is do the main characters appearing on screen seem likable? Bad or Good. And in this film they are. Sam Neil is excellent as usual and also Lawrence Fishburn, which I admit to be a very strong believable character of the film. The supporting cast does exactly what they are suppose to do within their character range. As we are all introduced at the beginning of the film, as the captain introduces the crew to Dr. Weir's character, this is why this works. We get to know the characters and learn to like them. The only character in the film that I feel uncomfortable with is Sam Neil's character. With the beginning intro of his wife committing suicide. So you know right away that this person is unstable. You could call it foreshadowing. So right away you know this character might be trouble. Because eventually you find out that he is the weakest person of the crew, unknowingly to the rest of the characters.The fact that the crew has no idea that what they are about to encounter makes this movie even more watchable. You feel how they feel confused and scared. Not knowing what is lurking in the bowels of the Event Horizon. It's like a being in a fugue state of mind, the flight or fright scenario. What would you do if you were seeing all these things that creep up to you from your bad past memories, contorting the them in front of you, and you know in your mind that maybe what you are seeing lifelike in front of your eyes, may or may not be true? Or is this unseen monster mocking your weaknesses? I would be frightened to these horrible visions. That's why I recommend this highly underrated film to everyone.The reason being, you don't really ever get to see where the ship Event Horizon went, or what the old crew encountered. You never really get to see the monster, the only thing that is portrayed in this wonderfully written and directed film is our own inner demons. And I think even today in the year 2010 that this is the true formula of making a great film, it's the idea of the unknown, the mystery and suspense. In all great horror films you always like the characters, you sometimes find something even in the monster that you see in yourself. I think that it is very hard to write something like this and make you feel that through the filming process. This movie has the quality of being a classic. And I truly appreciate all the hard work that was put into this film through the great acting and excellent film direction. It's always a lot of fun to watch from time to time. And is part of my movie collection.",8,0,1,8 October 2010
Evil Dead," A Gory Roller-coaster Of Horror Fun!
","I went into the theater with an open mind I really did not know what feeling to expect from this film, the original Evil Dead was campy and fun to watch, also it had awesome cinematography for it's time and creates a depth in the atmosphere around the characters in the film, and gave life to the surrounding woods that the cabin resides in.In this new version we have a young group of adults that arrive at a cabin in the woods, all for some type of radical drug intervention therapy, for the main character David's sister, things begin to go awry like in the original film, but done in a more life like sense, not so campy in this one. It takes a bit of time to get things rolling, but once events from the 'Book of the Dead' start to unravel, we get to see some excellent gore and make-up effects, that the first film should of had but did not(well not to this extent). I really liked the characters of the film, we get to know them and like them, David(Shiloh Fernandez) tries his best to deny the fact of all the events that just took place, that there must be some logical reason for them, even until the very end, just like Bruce Campbell did in the original.We also get to see some throwbacks from the original included in this film, which is a good thing. Kind of a 'hats off' to the fans of this series. Sam Raimi, Rob Tappert, and Bruce Campbell obviously had a close watch on the director Fede Alverez, these elements really show through in this edition.The cinematography was well done, the demons in the film we have all seen before in other films, but it's what they do to themselves that really sells the demon characters.Let's move on shall we? The gore! I understand that some people thought it was over the top.Now as a true fan of horror and gore, I didn't think this at all. Has anyone seen any of the 'Saw' films? I didn't think the gore was at all taking away from the original story, back when I was a kid and seen the Evil Dead for the first time on VHS I thought that was kind of gory. Now we have newer films like 'Saw' as I mentioned, and 'Hostel' these films make the original Evil Dead seem like a kids film(as for the gore I mean). I truly don't see what the big deal is. It seems to me that the Producers of this film finally got to do what they wanted to, and not be under minded by the MPAA. Evil Dead 2013, I can say I really liked it, it had great character cohesion, excellent camera work, and the fact that it wasn't filled with terrible acting, and girls with fake boobs running around topless. We all remember the terrible 'Piranha' remakes don't we?(If you don't know what I mean then that's a bonus for you). That film that I just mentioned strayed so far away from the original film that it was degrading to my intelligence, and all the rest of us that love horror.The Evil Dead was also tweaked a bit by changing the reason why these characters were going to the cabin in the first place. I liked that they didn't use the traditional young adults 'going to the woods storyline' just to have sex and do drugs(This could of happened if it was directed by the Michael Bay horror film revamp industry). This film is not perfect in any way, but I would definitely watch it again, not as much as the original I will always cherish that version.Final Thought. This new vision is an updated more polished version of the original, but I feel it will never replace the magic of the original cult classic. I am also not a fan of most recent remakes, but this is worth a watch. Finally a remake that made me feel glad for taking the time to watch it, I actually didn't feel let down leaving the theater this time around for once. Bravo!",7,9,28,8 April 2013
Jurassic World," Jurassic Park Remake
","I give this a negative 10 out of a positive 10. Aside from IMDb's idiot scale, and it's paid off Metacritic garbage. Jurassic Park(1994) was one of the most ground breaking films of it's time.Jurassic World is one of the most disappointing films of it's time. Let me explain.Jurassic World is like a mixture between going to Disney World for the first time(in 1984, with the whole Monorail Idea) but with Dinosaurs. There is no magic here, only lot's and lot's of CGI, Spielberg's original film was amazing, not only because he rewrote how Dino's should look, but realized some things must be old school as well.(this film takes a very lazy George Lucas approach ALL CGI) Not everything should be digitized. If you think my logic is incorrect, I must ask you one question, have you seen the remake of Spielberg's Poltergeist? I will tell you how that turned out, just go and visit Rotten Tomatoes. It was listed as rotten. Jurassic World is nothing but a recreation or reboot of the original, in order to squeeze a few more bucks out of Dino's. It really did nothing for me, all the original character's were there, the Park Owner, the Protector of the Dino's, the Creator, also the know it all's, along with the kids seeking adventure. (another carbon copy) Even with the new invention of creating a hybrid Dino, there really is nothing new to this story, this all happened in the original! Also the scenes involving mass panic was just accentuated by making the visitors a bunch of whiny rich CEO's. Conclusion.If your into the latest in sub par CGI films without a story, and like bland characters that have the same roles in 1994 and you also like films that are all about effect's and no content, or originality then I must say this is the film for you!But if your a more down to earth person that wants something more original, and doesn't try to copy everything Spielberg sis the first time while filming Jurassic Park, well I must say avoid this film at all cost's.",1,28,57,24 June 2015
Elysium," A Technological Mish Mash Mess.
","Just got back from the flicks, It's Monday night weekend after the premier. Elysium is a dramatic outlook on how things in our reality could end up. This is the story of a civilization that has actually separated the 1% rich people living in a Kubrickesque space station while the other 99% poor and disease ridden people still live on the planet and doing what they can to survive. Life on earth actually doesn't look that much different from our own reality just on a larger scale. The population on planet Earth would do anything to get a one way ticket to Elysium so that they could cure themselves of all their impurities with healing beds which is a device you lay on and completely heals every faulty molecule in their bodies.Matt Damon plays Max who at times seems kind of weak and dismal, portrayed as a beat down factory worker slaving away in a factory that produces robots for the rich,He also has a criminal past but now is trying live a straight miserable life instead of a miserable criminal life. All the while thinking of his boyhood fantasy, which was whisking away his girlfriend up to the space station Elysium.An accident at work leaves him with only 5 days to live. Of course here comes the old story of a small group of men taking on the 1% rich elite.Jodie Foster who I love and have always enjoyed watching plays a cold hearted conniving woman who is in charge of the security of Elysium. It's kind of nice to see her in a different role as a villain. But, her character Delacourt becomes highly annoying the more she is on screen. Aside from her terrible fake accent, which I think was supposed to sound British or something your guess is as good as mine. Delacourt turns against the President of the Station when he undermines her authority when she goes trigger happy and orders one of her rogue agents on Earth to kill 47 people that tried to land on a station after they stole fake ID's that get branded on there skin so that the station will recognize them as a citizen. Delacourt(Foster) feels that these people are threatening the very fabric of the stations population.I'm not adding all the storyline details to this review that would take way too long to point out all the faults on why this film doesn't work well. So read on for the short version.......Matt Damon and Jodie Foster seemed very detached from their characters, I don't know if it was the directing or not. The film seemed rushed in most parts even though it had a fairly lengthy runtime of 1hr 49mins. The technology in the film also doesn't match up. The station has the ability to have biobeds which can heal any disease in human history but they still have to use key cards to move from room to room in high security areas. The space station itself looks just like something from 2001 A Space Odyssey, except it has an artificial atmosphere made by plant life and trees. The fight scenes were of course filmed in seizure cam mode(If you don't know what that is, it's short for nauseating and annoying). Jodi Foster's role is pretty much pointless in the end. Max and his cohorts eventually land on Elysium to set things straight. Max's computer hacking friend in one scene has to decode a bunch of secure doors with a pin reader laptop that looks like it's more from 1990's than 200 years from now, all to gain access to the mainframe eventually rebooting the station so that it accepts all citizens as equal not just the rich elite.The more I think about this film the more I hate it. The visuals are stunning, the sound is amazing, but the storyline is old and rotten like a song being put on repeat. The film seems out of place and cliché most of the time. The villains in the film are boring and not worth mentioning except for the fact that they stole the main villain from Mad Max.I don't understand how they have the ability to heal everyone but still use computers with keyboards and doors with key cards. Most of the technology is not explained it's just thrown abruptly on the screen, and never gives us any explanation. As far as I'm concerned by the time we figure out how to molecularly heal our bodies of all diseases we will all be past this pathetic storyline of monetary gain and greed. The story is dumb and a waste of time, I expect this form of acting from Matt Damon, but not from Jodie Foster, she should of turn this role down. Also we have all seen Matt Damon in this type of gun wielding role way too many times to even give a crap.The two sides of the coin good and bad are certainly operating on two different frequencies and never truly are in tune with one another. This film had a lot of potential but spirals out of control, due to lack of character substance, and integrity. The film looses it's cohesion after the first half hour. Don't waste your time.",3,7,15,13 August 2013
This Is Spinal Tap," Silly situations made to be serious.
","I vote this film highly, I have caught bits and pieces over the years on TV but had never had the chance to actually watch it. And I grew up in the 80's.I thought most of my younger years that Spinal Tap was a real band. I was only about 7 years old when this came out, so please forgive me. I sat down to watch this, and realized, no they are not real, and yes it is very funny how Rob Reiner takes previous films like Led Zepplin's 'The Song Remains the Same' documentary film, and turns it on it's head. Especially when the lead singer in this film tries to do the Jimmy Page and instead of a violin bow on a guitar he actually takes a whole violin and uses it to play the guitar. This was hilarious, or when they try to sing popular tunes from other bands they always forget the words. I could go on and on.This film captures most of all the rock documentaries that I have seen from Zepplin to the Rolling Stones documentaries, it's so interesting how Reiner captures that by the film grade and just the acting in general. This film is actually looks and feels like Depeche Mode 101 directed by D.A Pennebaker. But that film wasn't made until a few years after. But it's funny how close it is to this film, kinda creepy.I'd say 'This is Spinal Tap' is a very funny film in an indirect British humour kind of way. The humour is very subtle, and sometimes have to think about it. It's one of those films where you have to watch it multiple times and see something different every time. I love how the film goes from the band being very popular to playing concerts to a smaller and smaller audience, this is another subtle thing I noticed.Great film, I loved it too bad it took 35 years to get around to it. The only problem I have is that is was too short.",9,1,3,14 October 2012
Sinister," This film is Sinister!
","Scott Derrickson's Sinister gives us confusion with an old fashion detective twist. Ethan Hawke delivers a stellar performance in this latest title Sinister. We start out this wonder macabre film with us witnessing a family getting hanged, then we move onto a family moving in to a new house where the hanging took place.At first glance I thought this would be the traditional writer/detective style film, as we move along with Ethan Hawke's character I thought this is going to be one of those 'who done it?' type films.I was wrong, Ethan Hawke brings us through a dark portal where we don't know what is real or I should say unreality and not of this world. We all learn as the film moves on that this maybe a serial killer at work. But I just wondered throughout the film why in 1998, in which year one of the murders took place why this was being filmed on 8mm? I guess it was because that's when all these murders started, when most people had an 8mm video camera at their dispose starting in the 1960's, where all these murders began, or maybe it's because that's when home movies started to become popular. Your guess is as good as mine.In this paranormal film I find there were plenty of scares, not really by the ghosts or demons, but by the dark atmosphere of the film, and also by it's strange sounding score, it also uses a lot of imagery to get that aspect across to it's audience. I really love this film, but in the same thought, it is a very dark psychological film. I have some mixed feelings, but all good feelings about the style of this film, it is a true noir horror, with a unhappy ending. Mr.Derricksons used a lot of old school camera technique's not really seen in new films. The dead children that appear had a mix of good make up and also great slow motion effects, which I haven't seen since the film 'The Cell' It has an ending being positive or negative, it could go either way.The only thing that annoyed me about this film is the very end when Mr. Boogie flashed in front of us before the credits rolled. I thought that was kind of immature for the director to do such a thing, it wasn't scary, and felt kind of cheap to try and squeeze in that one last scare. They should of left it as is, with the camera panning out on the box of 'Home Movies', that would of been much classier. Overall a very entertaining watch.",8,1,4,14 February 2013
Life," Space Star Fish Snorefest
","This film is predictable and cliché and just down right boring. Absolutely no character development by either the stars of the film or from the actual life form, 40 minutes takes place in a sealed off science chamber with a new life form and a mouse. Then we get to see a jelly belly starfish take out the characters one by one. Kind of like what Jason Vorhees does in the Friday the 13th franchise. This film has two major stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds, their acting was sub par, they are two actors that can't do a space film, it just doesn't seem like their type of role for some reason. The whole film from start to finish feels off to me. It could be the fact that we have seen this type of story so many times before. I could just imagine all the people that actually paid to see this garbage, probably checking the time on their smartphones after the first 20 minutes. Final Verdict.Save your money for something else, this film is just a tired story line with two major stars in it, that's the only thing that sold tickets. It was just a paycheck to these two main stars, and that's about it. On a side note, I see a score of 7.0, the studios must have their fake accounts up and running for this film. IMDb is so stupid, they think it's real users don't know what they do, bunch of half wit inbreeds that run this stupid website",1,38,75,1 April 2017
Cloud Atlas," String Theory Is Cloud Atlas
","Cloud Atlas is a story based on string theory, and what I mean by that is, all things throughout our universe or multi-verse have repercussions on every decision we make.In this film we see many stories with certain outcomes from what choices the characters make, a negative action can have a reaction to another life connected to it, and so can a positive action. It's like tapping on the strings of a grand piano. String theory basically claims that all life is connected in one way or another, kind of like the 'six degrees of separation', it's a new concept, but an interesting one.Cloud Atlas gives us the view of different characters from different points in time, and also from different universe's. It's a very interesting story that makes us think beyond what we really are.This film is filled with comedic instances also very horrific ones, it gives us a bird's eye view of such wonderful scientific theories in which we can not explain, as of yet. I enjoyed the telling of the intersecting stories that seem to have a few plots in common no matter what time, or universe they took place.Cloud Atlas, is a different kind of story telling, with radical ideas, I for one enjoyed this film, even though it is a long runtime, I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a story beyond our logic and beyond our dreams. This film just makes me wonder of who we really are, and most importantly what we are.",8,1,3,27 February 2013
