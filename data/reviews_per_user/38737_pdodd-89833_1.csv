Vertigo," More plot holes than a collander
","Why the widespread adulation of Hitchcock ? Vertigo requires one buys into the totally unbelievable plot and sub-plots, which is only possible if one possesses no critical faculty whatsoever, thus for the discerning viewer, the only possible judgement on the film is that the whole affair is 'daft', and a waste of time, and unworthy of the generous acclaim heaped on it by the so-called 'learned critics'. In many of his films Hitchcock sneers at his audience, promulgating his personal distaste of the human race, investing his films with misogyny, viciousness, scorn and his own sense of omnipotence in manipulating characters with scant disregard for any valid sense of human feeling. In 'Vertigo', the two main characters are lonely losers, who, unaware of their own failings, who look for redemption where there can be none due to their unredeemed flaws.",3,4,10,27 December 2016
