Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," One of the best Star Wars movies ever!
","When I first saw this in the theater I thought the best part was the war in Scarif. You really think that something might go wrong for the Rebel Alliance but they desperately work it out! Another good thing is that the heroes die in the end, which doesn't make a happy ending (which is good in my opinion). And the last best part of this was the romance between Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor, they die holding hands! 9/10. Great entertainment!",9,3,5,14 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The best parts were...
","The best parts of this movie were the dialogues between Rey, Luke and Yoda. The ending of Luke was very good too!",9,3,19,24 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A great comeback of Star Wars!
",In my opinion the best parts of this were the character Rey and the great participation of Harrison Ford as Han Solo. I liked very much the part where Solo says the Force is real with the Jedi and the Sith!,8,1,17,7 July 2018
