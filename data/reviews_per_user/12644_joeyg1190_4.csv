Casablanca," Casablanca (1942)
","Unarguably one of the greatest American achievements in cinema, this film is truly a classic. Bogart and Bergman have incredible chemistry together and the script and the directing and the atmosphere is intoxicating. One of the greatest roles of Bogart's career.",10,1,1,12 September 2018
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Life of Brian (1979)
","Here we have a truly hilarious film. There is one scene of graphic nudity that I found excessive. Otherwise, the raunchy jokes and gags are often hysterical. Some audiences will be appalled by the sacrilegious plot. Others will find the controversial plot to be the most satisfying element of the film. The movie will also be especially amusing to those who appreciate dark humor.",9,1,2,10 November 2018
Alien," Alien (1979)
","This film certainly deserves to be called a classic. Though the first forty minutes or so are very slow, the film is a special masterpiece and much more than a mere sci-fi flick. The Xenomorph is a truly remarkably designed creature and Ridley Scott raises the bar for what a truly suspenseful, terrifying film should be like. Sigourney Weaver is excellent as the protagonist Ellen Ripley.",10,0,1,4 September 2018
Paths of Glory," Paths of Glory (1957)
","What we have here is a truly powerful anti-war film. Kubrick does a phenomenal job with directing this masterpiece and Kirk Douglas delivers the performance of a lifetime. The final scene is sure to bring a tear to many eyes, as it reminds us that, regardless of the different sides of war we may find ourselves on, we are all human beings.",10,0,1,10 November 2018
