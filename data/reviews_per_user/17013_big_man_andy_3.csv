Alien 3," A classic
","This film is an absolutely spectacular movie. Many see this as the poorest of the alien saga but i think its one of the best. A spectacular story bringing back a very claustrophobic feel the original had. David Fincher directed this perfectly and if you have seen the 1991 assembly-cut on the quadrilogy it really opens up the plot into more detail an helps you understand what happens. This is a brilliant film underrated by most. Ripleys death scene at the end was poor how could she hold the thing after its just bust through her ribs and out her stomach????? Interesting how all of the criminals seem to be English well stereo-type English anyway. David Finchers direction is superb. The dark, evil tone of the film was set perfectly by him. This film is a very underrated piece of cinema. The acting was very strong as was the soundtrack. Something about this film just set it out from the rest. All in all a superb film and the second best in the Alien franchise. Go back out and give it a watch!",10,22,24,26 May 2005
Gremlins," Another one of the 80's finest
","Throughout the 80's cinema goers experienced some incredible movies and were treated to some very special moments and Gremlins firmly cements itself into the top draw of the era.While Gremlins is a 'Very' black comedy it still appeals to most people. Whether it's the scary side, or the cute side (provided by Gizmo) the film delights and scares people still to this day.After viewing both of the films again very recently with my girlfriend, who has never seen either before, it was great to see the reaction of a new viewer watching 25 years after its release.Very well directed, shame about some of the acting and some of the music pieces are haunting.Now what makes it so special? Well ...to be honest i don't know, it just has a magic factor to it that holds you throughout and keeps you wanting to revisit time after time. Having both Gremlins and Gremlins 2 in your DVD/Blu-ray collection is a must, if not i urge you to pick them up! Especially if you have never seen them! Now all i have to decide is which film is better 1 ...or 2?",9,0,2,24 December 2009
Men in Black," Awesome
","This is an awesome film!! I love this movie, Will Smith is awesome as J and Tommy Lee Jones is as good as he always is as K. The Story was brilliant and really makes you think. Brilliant theme song and so much better than the 2nd one, which in my opinion was quite poor. The cockroach guy is kinda weird but nice idea. Gets a little stupid at the end which why i gave it a 9 not 10. Z is pretty cool got a few good lines very good film. I'm very annoyed to see that its not in top 250 i think people should watch it again and re vote.Brilliant film any one who don't like it is a fool! If you haven't seen it run down to your local video store and get it NOW!",9,1,1,23 September 2005
