Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful disappointment
","I loved the original blade runner. It's one of my top 3 movies of all time. I never had very high expectations for this sequel, because I knew it could never live up to the original. But I wanted to see it for the sake of nostalgia and I was genuinely curious to see what they had decided to do. I'll start with the positive. The cinematography, CGI, and atmosphere generated by the settings were all incredible. I prefer the original's, however, as it had a somewhat 'darker' nature to it. That being said, 2049 is Oscar-worthy in these departments. 10/10 here. The music was alright and felt fitting. Now the bad... Which is the rest of the film. The plot was entirely underwhelming and undermining the original, the themes almost coming across as desperate attempts to be as ground breaking as the original. In fact, I disliked the concept so much that it took away from the original movie, which sucked. The acting was mostly poor, though what can one expect from a sullen sulker like Gosling (he doesn't act, he just sort of glowers). The love sub-plot was weak and STRANGE, and Jared Leto... honestly, all I can say/ask is 'what the heck?'. Not even Harrison Ford and the nostalgia trap at the very end of the movie (the music) could save this disaster of a film.In summary, this film is stunning visually, and that's all. Watch it for what it is: a chance to show off the advances in CGI. Do what I did, expect the worst. I am still glad I saw it.",4,9,17,3 November 2017
