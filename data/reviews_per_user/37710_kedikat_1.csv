10 Cloverfield Lane," Great multiple plot lines.
","The possible plot lines are varied from the start. They continue in multiple possibilities for almost the whole movie. Some new ones popping up. Which is surprising considering the cramped quarters. You never get any extra clues from jumping into another character's point of view. The very few clues, are only observed from the one character.I really like the way it very casually connects to Clovefield. It would be interesting to see some other stories try and connect to that. Cloverfield left an abundance of loose ends. Seems ripe for others to link into it. Could be a lot of fun to see independent stories build on that original mystery.",9,2,2,1 July 2016
