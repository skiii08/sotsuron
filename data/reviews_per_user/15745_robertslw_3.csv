First Man," 'First Man' is an out of this world experience
","Damien Chazelle's 'First Man' opens on a dark, cramped cockpit shaking viciously while piloted by Ryan Gosling's Neil Armstrong. His eyes are filled with fear and panic until the cockpit is suddenly illuminated by the sunlight reflecting off the Earth's horizon in the upper echelons of the atmosphere. Relief, followed by astonishment, washes over his face as he hovers in the vast beauty of space. He then begins to plummet and the fear returns.All of this terror, beauty and astonishment carries throughout the rest of the film. These feelings soon lead to an unforgettable, visceral and dazzling experience.The eight years of trials and tribulations Armstrong had to endure before the Apollo 11 mission that made him an American hero is the fulcrum of 'First Man.' While this characterizes the basic synopsis, there is so much more to the film regarding the man inside the spacesuit.Armstrong's complexity is mesmerizing. All the insecurities, fears and determination he experienced is felt through Gosling's stoic performance. His subtle changes of demeanor throughout the film with every loss he experiences add a sense of weight and suspense to an outcome everyone is aware of.Gosling's moments of vulnerability are incredibly believable as well. His quivering lip and fight to hold back tears in moments of distress help show why Armstrong is considered a hero today - he was just a man who had to overcome many obstacles.He did not overcome these obstacles alone, however. His wife, Janet Armstrong, is masterfully portrayed by Claire Foy. She brings a fiery intensity which encapsulates Janet's concerns for their family while also trying to support all his endeavors to the best of her ability. Scenes of her nervously sitting hunched over the radio during the Gemini 8 and Apollo 11 missions while also tending to the children's needs gives the audience an authentic look at how important she truly was to her family.While all these performances help depict the scale of this arduous journey, the directorial work by the Academy Award-winning Chazelle puts you directly in Armstrong's shoes. When Gosling approaches the Gemini 8 shuttle, the corridor shakes and hanging lights sway, ramping up the intensity and puting the viewer in his perspective, experiencing his fear.Chazelle's constant implementation of close-up shots also allows the audience to notice every expression the actors bring, creating a deeper connection to this true story.A cornerstone of this film, of course, is the interstellar aspects - specifically outer space and the moon. Created using using computer-generated imagery, these aspects made for some breathtaking moments. The vast empty space surrounding the shuttle in certain scenes brings a strange beauty to the serene void confirming why Armstrong and many others were allured by the mission. The recreation of the moon is incredibly realistic as well, making the scenes on the lunar surface feel tangible.All of these emotionally impactful scenes are supported by a beautiful score that at times seemed whimsical, and at others suspenseful. This makes the danger of the journey feel incredibly real while making the payoffs feel magical.'First Man' combines a variety of filmmaking aspects to create one of the greatest depictions of Armstrong and his mindset during his times at NASA while also creating an unforgettable experience that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible.",9,0,1,23 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper's 'A Star is Born' shines bright
","'Twelve notes and the octave repeats. It's the same story, told over and over, forever. All any artist can offer the world is how they see those 12 notes. That's it.'These are words said late in Bradley Cooper's directorial debut 'A Star Is Born.' Ultimately, this statement is the mindset of Cooper's take on the fourth remake of this classic and it works wholeheartedly.The film centers on Cooper's washed-up, alcoholic musician Jack falling in love with Lady Gaga's Ally, trying to rocket her to stardom after realizing her insane musical talent.The performances by Cooper and Gaga are absolutely mesmerizing. This is Gaga's first attempt at acting in a feature film and she succeeds in almost every aspect. She executes all of her dialogue with a sincerity that many other musicians-turned-actors fail to bring to their film debuts. Cooper also uses many close-ups of Gaga in the film and her facial acting is enthralling. All the emotions Ally experiences throughout the film - from anxiety to astoundment - can be felt through every eye twitch and expression.Cooper portrays the washed-up Jack to a T. His gruff voice and demeanor are incredibly believable, the acting is also completely subtle with all the little ticks Cooper adds. He builds his character's disease of tinnitus - specifically by constantly leaning into conversations to hear better - and the audience gets completely lost in the performance.His work behind the camera is mind-blowing, especially as his first time directing a feature film. The framing of certain scenes and moments cause chills to run down the viewer's spine - sparking emotions from absolute heartbreak to joyous celebration.The cinematography is also breathtaking. Every scene has some sort of color combination that creates shots that leaves jaws on the floor. A scene of Ally walking out of a bathroom stall enraged after a call with an ex-lover could have been very by-the-books, but Cooper's use of lighting, costume and set design leads to a shot of Gaga screaming, perfectly-centered, surrounded by a black-and-white tiled bathroom that's been ingrained in my mind since I left the theater.All of these aspects are perfectly executed in the visceral concert scenes scattered throughout the film. Everything from the excellent framing to the stellar performances is on display for everyone to take in. You can feel every ounce of soul the actors put into their singing and it's mostly because all the performances were shot on location with no autotune, creating a genuine concert experience.The only place where the film falters is its pacing near the final act. The film switches focus to certain characters near the end because of specific plot developments, which slows the pace, but doesn't bring it to a grinding stop.This pacing switch is made up for in the third act when everything built up in the film pays off in a heartbreaking way that feels completely earned.This story might have have been told multiple times, but Cooper's unique eye behind and in front of the camera along with Gaga's realistic, poignant performance created a fresh and emotional take on a classic. 'A Star Is Born' is a must-see and definitely worth the price of admission.",8,1,2,23 October 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Fargo meets In Bruges
","Two of the finest dark comedies released in the past 20 years have included 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths' both of these films were written and directed by Martin Mcdonagh. 5 years after his release of 'Seven Psychopaths' Martin Mcdonagh has released 'Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing Missouri' another perfect black comedy filled with a a lovable but flawed cast of characters.'In Three Billboard Outside of Ebbing Missouri' Frances McDormand plays a mother named Mildred who desperately wants justice for her daughter who was raped and murdered. She decides to take action into her own hands by putting up three very abrasive Billboards that criticize the cops who failed to solve this case. In doing this Mildred angers many cops and citizens including Sam Rockwell's Dixon and Woody Harrellson's Willoughby in the small town of Ebbing Missouri leading to torment that can be humorous at times while also being darkly disturbing.Three Billboards succeeds at everything it sets off to do. The one thing it succeeds at the most, however, is the introduction of the huge ensemble cast in a fluid and natural way. Each one of the characters has been fully developed in a satisfying way leading to redemption in some cases and tragedy in others. The main reason this development works so well is the performances. Frances McDormand is fantastic as Mildred and makes you feel the desperation, and regret every time she is on screen. Sam Rockwell is FANTASTIC as the dim-witted corrupt cop Dixon. Rockwell's performance offers a huge amount of comedy while also offering some the most disturbing moments in the film. Woody Harrellson Peter Dinklage and Lucas Hedges all also do a fantastic job in the film.The Cinematography was stellar, it fills the small town of Ebbing Missouri with life and beauty. There is one stellar one shot in the film that never shies away from the horrific event that is occurring on screen.All in All 'Three Billboard Outside of Ebbing Missouri' is a funny dark ride that pays off in every way because of the great acting by every member of the ensemble cast and the direction by Martin Mcdonagh",10,7,16,29 November 2017
