Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Squandered Potential.
","Well. I'd like to make one thing clear before continuing. I really don't like this film. I don't dislike it as much as Attack of the Clones but I still really don't enjoy The Phantom Menace. But if you do, then more power to you. I'm not going to try and take away any merit found in this film that I cannot see. I'll simply be explaining why I think this film is deeply flawed and not as good as the originals. As I said before, I think Attack of the Clones is worse and I would likely be crueler whilst reviewing that film but that's besides the point. The Phantom Menace is flawed because of:1. A very VERY poorly written script.2. Sterile, fake looking, poorly aged CGI characters and environments.3. Questionable acting (mainly as a result of the two above points)4. A bizarrely dull, politically focused plot.
4.5. A scattershot conclusion split into four different - simultaneous - sequences (the Gungan war against the droids, the castle infiltration, Anakin flying in space and Obi-Wan and Quai-Gon Jin VS Darth Maul)And lastly, as well as possibly the biggest crime this film commits...5. Wasted PotentialI'll elaborate on that last one later.1.The script is just a disaster. It's difficult to blame some of the actors at times just because of how inept Lucas' tired dialogue is. It is strangely focused on some sort of protection deal between a band of aliens on Sidious' payroll and Queen Amidala, for the first 20 minutes or so. The dialogue doesn't serve to advance the plot or develop the characters, it just enables Lucas to insert as many lame gags as he can as well as ret-con the universe from the originals. The introduction of 'Midichlorians' was the straw that broke the camels back for me with this film. To take a concept so vast and mysterious as The Force and liquidise it into something so boringly tangible was crushing to listen to. It essentially voided Yoda's entire teachings to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back as Yoda explains that The Force isn't about the physical and yet Lucas literally makes it about how many 'Midichlorians' are in your blood cells. Ridiculous and an insult to the original idea.2. The CGI is astonishingly bad and has aged as well as I would imagine milk from the time of the films release has. It just looks ridiculous, particularly when considering how much time is spent with JarJar next to the main cast in which we are supposed to believe he is real. The environments look pretty hideous, especially during the Gungan war segment, which looks like the old Windows XP desktop background. There is just too much of it as well, far too much time is spent panning across fake looking environments or CGI characters interacting with one another. Not only is that just uninspired, it's not remotely pleasant or impressive to look at, quite the opposite. Some of the designs are plain ugly and honestly can be quite disturbing, particularly the Gungan higher ups. Fortunately they aren't given much screen time. The biggest problem this brought was the lack of authenticity to the acting. The actors spent the majority of the shooting inside a blue room with nothing to look at or interact with, which would make it incredibly hard for them to emote or be invested in what's supposed to be happening in the context of the film. Overall, the CGI that Lucas revelled in only serves to make the film magnificently worse. It is treated as a crutch rather than a tool to be used sparingly for the betterment of the film's visual style which fundamentally breaks it at its core.3. The performances across the board aren't offensive, but they leave a lot to be desired and, in all honesty, some of them really are bad. Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson (the two leads I suppose seeing as there isn't really a main character) are both talented actors, but the script + the sterile blue screen environments they spent most of the film shooting in front of, caused them to falter. They aren't bad, just stiff and lifeless with little emotion or passion which is fitting given the conditions that they were performing in. But again, the film suffers from Lucas' poor decision making. Natalie Portman is ok I suppose, she doesn't really do very much other than speak to Anakin. Speaking of which... Jake Lloyd is terrible. Yes he's a child, but that's hardly an excuse because they're were a plethora of capable child actors out there that Lucas could've cast. The decision baffles me because time and time again throughout this film he proves he has no aptitude for acting whatsoever. 'I'll try spinning, that's a good trick' a perfect example of Lucas' bad script accented by crummy line delivery.4. The plot is a total mess. It starts with lame political debates to interactions with poorly rendered, horrific looking fish people to princess saving to pod racing and finally fighting a satanic looking man with horns to the death. The first 40 minutes or so are a total bore filled with mindless action and lame, unfunny jokes. The Pod race is somewhat entertaining but the visual effects are far from impressive. The final confrontation with Darth Maul incorporates highly impressive choreography and a wonderful score to accompany it. But for me personally, it's too clean cut and perfect looking. It lacks the raw emotion of the final confrontation in The Empire Strikes Back and especially Return of the Jedi. It's an epic spectacle but I couldn't care less about any of the characters because the film hasn't developed them enough, especially Darth Maul who mutters about three lines throughout the whole film. It's all flash no substance, the scale of an ocean with the depth of a puddle.4.5The conclusion is also a massive mess. In spite of what I said about the Darth Maul fight, it is by far the best thing about this film and if the conclusion had focused solely on it then it perhaps would've resonated more with me. However, it is only one quarter of a four part ending with the additional three sequences moving alongside at the same time. They're all not nearly as interesting or half as cool looking as the lightsaber duel. The least terrible of the remaining three is probably Anakin flying around in space, even though the acting is still very poor from Lloyd. The castle infiltration and the Gungan war against the droids are both absolutely needless and awful. The castle sequence is just such a bore and the war is an ugly, unfunny, chaotic disaster depicted entirely through CGI.(Also as a final side note I'd like to mention how utterly rubbish the Droids are. Stormtroopers were very inept at fighting but they at the very least represented a physical presence of the Empire. The Droids get cut down by lightsabers like butter with a hot knife. They present absolutely no threat to anyone and exude no presence whatsoever. Not to mention they look terrible as well as they are entirely CGI. Godawful looking, easily defeated, pathetic toothpick robots that serve as nothing more than cannon fodder for the Jedi).5. And finally, The Phantom Menace's biggest failure:Wasted Potential. What do I mean? I mean that the film had everything it needed conceptually to be great.
It had a lineup of perfectly capable actors: (save for Jake Lloyd) Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Iain McDiarmid etc.
It had John Williams, the genius who composed the iconic score of the originals.
It had all new CGI potential that could've been utilised effectively if used only when needed.
It had a very interesting premise - the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader, and this would be the first chapter to explore it.But alas, it managed to squander every ounce of potential and delivered to us one of the biggest disappointments in cinematic history.I'm honestly glad if you can enjoy this film and the rest of the prequels for that matter.But to me, these films are nothing but a painful insight into Lucas' ineptitude and ego when it comes to his own property when left entirely in charge.",2,2,2,3 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I'm at a loss with the praise this film is garnering...
","I can't understand why people seem to be defending this film so much. I'm all for expressing your own opinions and I totally respect that, but all of the positive reviews I am reading seem to only concern themselves with refuting the points against 'Attack of the Clones' rather than presenting legitimate reasons to justify the 9 star ratings.I do believe it to be a little ignorant to throw the entire prequel saga under the bus because this film's successor is indeed somewhat of an improvement upon the two that preceded it. However, Revenge of the Sith was far too little far too late because The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones both, for lack of a better phrase.The thing that perplexes me the most is the defence and even praise of the special effects, when the fact is they look terribly dated and far too clean cut to come across as convincing. Not to mention that they are overused to the point that the film basically becomes a live action cartoon.Remember when the light sabre was a mystical device that was only shown in times of crisis or importance, to convey the significance and power of this honourable weapon? Yeah just forget all that and watch 500 Jedi jump into an arena in broad day light and slice a bunch of poorly rendered, CGI toothpick robots like butter with a hot knife.
The point being that the light sabre has gone from being a mysterious and wondrous commodity. to nothing more than a nostalgia prop that hardcore fans / children can drool over while Lucas renders as many as he possibly can into each frame.Do you remember when Yoda was an actual character that betrayed the stigma of the hero being a mighty and strong warrior to convey the message that the force is not about the physical? Forget all that nonsense and watch in awe as he pulls out a mini light sabre and starts barrel rolling more than an attack jet.The issue with poor continuity and overuse of CGI could be overlooked if the story and characters were compelling, which they certainly aren't. I am fully aware that Lucas' script is far from stellar but that can't be used as justification for Hayden Christensen. I'm sorry but the kid cannot act, nothing about his portrayal is convincing and when people say 'he is good at making himself look angry' I'm afraid that is not even nearly ample enough to forgive the rest of his quite frankly appalling performance. Ewan McGregor is there, and he does things, that relate to the plot I guess. Natalie Portman is there to be eye candy and to 'fall in love' with Anakin in a less convincing manner than a Primary school adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.The entire final action sequence just blows, it's all flash no substance which quite honestly seems to be what Lucas was going for considering the script.I am not calling this film bad as a hater of all things new. I am not calling this film bad as a nostalgia blinded, fan of the originals. I am calling this film bad as a lover of film, please understand that.",2,4,6,13 October 2019
The Great Gatsby," What a bore.
","Now I've not read the source material so I can't compare and contrast in that respect. I'll be looking at this on a purely cinematic level.So I love Leo DiCaprio, I love Tobey Maguire, they are both wonderful actors and give pretty solid performances here... and that is honestly about as much praise as I can give.This film is just flat out bad, certainly not in a funny way either. It's so unrelentingly boring that I found my self having to take breaks at 20 minute intervals because I simply couldn't sit through it all at once. The worst part is when it isn't just a boring, uninspired montage of expository dialogue, it becomes a loud, obnoxious mess of misplaced modern music and really really terrible editing. I'm aware that a lot of films based in older settings use modern music as a sort of juxtaposition but in this film it's abused to the point of annoyance. Also why does Gatsby have to say 'old sport' at the end of every single sentence? I get what they were going for and I don't know if that's how it was in the book, but for god sakes why does he need to say it so abundantly? If you took a shot for every time Gatsby says that phrase, you'd be dead in 30 seconds, if you hadn't already died of boredom.Honestly what a waste of time, I'm amazed I actually managed to force myself through to the end of this snooze fest. Absolutely do not recommend.",3,1,2,28 March 2020
