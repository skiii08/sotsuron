Alien 3," Better than Resurrection at least
","OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's 'aliens' weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the 'what if' alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more 'killer instinct' then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.",7,0,2,25 May 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Pretty good vampire film
","Its been a long time since Iv'e seen a 'Good' vampire film after Blade and Fright Night. While I must say, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, is a damn good vampire movie! It may not have been the vampire film we were waiting for and might not be better than Blade or Fright Night, it'll definitely take away that 'ich' for a new vampire film. The story is decent for this film, even though it has plot holes. The movie is better seen in 3D 'cause there's a lot of it! However, I don't think this movie is an R-rated film, even with all the cuss words that are said in the movie. It just feels more like PG-13 film if you ask me. Not matter the rating, this is a great vampire film to watch till the next Blade film finally comes out. If you plan on watching this movie, watch it in 3D.",9,0,1,25 May 2013
