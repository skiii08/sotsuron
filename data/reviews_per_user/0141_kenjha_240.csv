The Devil's Advocate," Guilty as Sin
","A hotshot Florida lawyer is hired by a powerful New York law firm. Pacino is tailor-made for the role of the larger-than-life owner of the law firm. Reeves is miscast as the whiz kid lawyer who's in for more than he bargains for; his performance is so wooden that one can see every acting muscle being flexed to no avail. Theron and Nielsen are fine as the love interests. The film is reminiscent of 'Rosemary's Baby,' but is not as compelling as that film. Starting with an intriguing premise, it is engaging enough for the most part, but becomes increasingly ridiculous, including a contrived finale that seems to have been tacked on as an afterthought.",6,4,6,4 July 2010
The King's Speech," Good History Lesson
","This historical drama recounts the plight of King George VI, who must deal with his stammering problem after unexpectedly ascending to the throne. This doesn't sound like material that would translate into a winning film, but it turns out to be quite entertaining. Firth is fine as the King, a role that finally brought an Oscar to one of the most reliable British actors. Rush is equally good as the speech therapist whose unorthodox methods and uncouth manner infuriate the king. Ironically, when the king delivers his big speech to rally his country against the Germans, the music that is playing on the soundtrack is the Seventh Symphony of Beethoven, the great German composer.",8,0,2,9 August 2011
Vertigo," Hitchcock's Masterpiece
","A retired San Francisco police detective becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to tail. This is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film, a dark, fascinating mystery about obsession and control. Stewart is excellent as the befuddled detective. Novak was a limited actress but in this film her stiffness and other-worldly beauty are perfectly suited to the role of the elusive woman that Stewart must have. From the great opening scene where Stewart's vertigo is revealed to the plot twist midway to the haunting finale, this is an expertly constructed film. The on-location shooting is a big plus and Herrmann provides another of his memorable scores.",10,3,8,5 December 2009
Black Swan," Not Bad but Clichéd
","A fragile dancer lands the lead role in 'Swan Lake,' but struggles to meet the expectations of the ballet director. Portman received a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of the unstable young woman who not only has to deal with a demanding and lecherous boss but also an oppressive mother. Unfortunately the film is full of clichés: the boss demanding sexual favors (Cassel), the has-been star (Ryder), the manipulative understudy (Kunis), the stage mother (Hershey). The depiction of Portman's psychological descent from White Swan to Black Swan is simplistic and some of the scenes are gratuitously graphic. The dance scenes are well done, helped by Tchaikovky's great score.",7,1,3,7 August 2011
Changeling," Heart-Wrenching Drama
","A woman's son goes missing and is returned to her by the police a few months later, except that it's a different boy. This is a heart-wrenching drama based on true events in 1920s L.A. Jolie gives a moving performance as the woman who must deal with not only the loss of her son, but also a corrupt police department determined to discredit her for insisting that the kid is not her son. Eastwood does a great job of evoking the period and building the tension. After an intriguing start, however, the film does seem to lose some its focus and lingers too much on subsidiary aspects of the case. The supporting cast is good, but why does Malkovich deliver his lines in a robotic cadence?",8,2,6,9 July 2010
Scarface," Overdone
","Violent and inferior remake of the 1932 classic is entertaining but overdone. The plot is lame. Tony goes from (dishwashing) rags to riches in a few months. He shoots people all over the place but when he's got to kill a man for Sosa he employs an elaborate plan with a car bomb. The finale is the definition of 'over the top.' Pacino seems to be doing a parody of a gangster, with the annoying Cuban accent (you keep expecting him to say, 'Luuucy, I'm home.'), the angry scowl, and the tough guy talk. DePalma's camera work is at times overly flashy, thereby becoming a distraction rather than enhancing the action. He also could have used a decent editor.",7,1,2,28 May 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat only leetle funny
",Reporter from Khazakhstan is sent to U. S. to film a documentary but becomes obsessed with finding Pamela Anderson. The film is nothing more than a series of jokes. The jokes are hit-and-miss and when they are misses the film drags because there is nothing else to sustain interest. It's too little crude humor spread out over the length of a feature film. The best bits have to do with Borat getting lessons on the English language and in social manners. Cohen has a field day as Borat and the British actor is quite believable as an Eastern European. Viewers will have a hard time purging their memories of Cohen and the very large Davitian wrestling in the nude.,6,0,2,23 May 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," Fun but Uneven
","A victim of mistaken identity, a man finds himself in the position of committing a murder or being killed by underworld figures. The plot has similarities to 'North by Northwest,' a fact that is even mentioned in this movie. The first half of the film is quite good, with break-neck pacing and witty dialog propelling the story forward, although it is not clear what is going on. Then the plot turns dark as the loose ends are tied and the big pictures starts to become clear; the film also starts to become less fun at this point. There are good performances from Hartnett, Liu, Freeman, Kingsley, and Willis. Well-made but a bit too clever for its own good.",7,1,3,1 September 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Annoying Aronofsky
","The startling message of this movie is that drugs are bad. Who knew?There's no plot, only a series of scenes showing the effect of drugs. Burstyn gives a good performance and is the only character with any depth; the others are nothing more than stereotypes. Aronofsky uses every trick he learned in film school: split screens, fast motion, slow motion, extreme closeups, trick photography, repetitive shots, etc. While he no doubt thinks he is being innovative, his repeated attempts to call attention to himself is simply annoying and distracting. Someone should take his camera away for assault on the audience with a deadly weapon. There is a good score performed by the Kronos Quartet.",5,1,4,4 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Horrible
","After the phenomenal success of the 'Star Wars' trilogy, one can't blame Lucas for going for more gold, but after 16 years this is what he came up with? This horrible film has a collection of weird and annoying characters engaged in tedious, mindless action. There is no rhyme or rhythm to the proceedings. The dialog is laughably bad. What's with the goofy dialect for Jar Jar and why does this doofus get so much screen time? Lucas fails miserably not only with his embarrassing script, but also with his inept direction. He is a special effects wizard and seems to be clueless about storytelling and acting. Why does he have Portman deliver her lines like a robot? A major disappointment.",2,5,11,3 May 2009
3:10 to Yuma," Routine Remake
","In this remake of the 1957 Western, a rancher escorts an outlaw to a train so he can collect a bounty. Bale is pretty good as the rancher determined to complete his mission. Crowe is OK if underwhelming as the outlaw, never quite believable as a man of the West. Fonda is fine as a crusty old bounty hunter. The original was well made but was marred by an unsatisfying ending. The good news is that this remake changes the ending. The bad news is that it is even more unsatisfying. In fact the ending is nonsensical. The plot has also been expanded from the original, losing some of the tension in the process. If nothing else, the filmmakers should be applauded for keeping the genre alive.",7,1,2,9 April 2010
The Sound of Music," Lovely Sound
","Sure, it's corny and an easy target for cynical viewers, but this is grand entertainment for the whole family. Andrews and Plummer are quite good in the leads and the children are all adorable (awww!). The cinematography beautifully captures the Austrian countryside. It is all masterfully guided by Wise, an under-rated director who also made the other great musical of the 1960s, 'West Side Story.' Despite its great length, it manages to stay engaging, thanks to a fine script. Most of all, there is the wonderful music of Rodgers and Hammerstein, including 'My Favorite Things,' 'Do Re Mi,' and the title tune, starting with that memorable aerial shot.",9,3,10,9 August 2006
Skyfall," Best in Craig's List So Far
","A former agent with a personal vendetta against M goes postal against MI6. It seems this franchise has undergone a number of reboots in the last couple of decades in attempts to stay relevant half a century after it was launched. Some of the changes make no sense, seeming to have been implemented in a vacuum, ignoring the preceding films. Other than long- term changes, this one is more low-tech than recent entries in this series, and this is a refreshing change. The final showdown between Bond and the villain takes place at an isolated mansion, and is a throwback to an old-fashioned action movie. In his third outing, Craig appears to be becoming more comfortable as 007. Bardem makes an amusing if goofy villain.",7,3,6,30 March 2013
The Hangover," Mildly Amusing
","For his bachelor party, a man goes to Vegas with his buddies. Hilarity ensues...sort of. The film tries very hard to to be funny but fails to deliver many laughs. It is entertaining and provides enough amusement to keep it from dragging. The script consists of a series of vignettes that don't all come together the way they do in the best comedies. The sophistication level of the comedy is pretty low, a step above 'The Three Stooges,' and there is a sense of deja-vu to it all. There is a Vegas segment in the 1999 comedy 'Go' that is more amusing that anything here. The main source of laughs here is the doofus brother-in-law played by Galifianakis.",7,5,8,9 April 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Warning: Eye Rolling May Cause Dizziness
","It starts with a scene that would have us believe that an ancient civilization implemented a high-tech security system to safeguard an idol. Yes, the movie is exciting but the action is so utterly ridiculous that it makes James Bond films and 'The Road Runner' cartoons look realistic. While it's understandable that one has to suspend disbelief when watching a film, the level of stupidity suggests that Spielberg has no respect for the viewer's intelligence. Scenes such as Jones's stunt under the moving vehicle and the revelation of the contents of the ark are sure to have any adult viewer rolling his eyes so often that there's danger of collapsing from dizziness.",4,6,16,26 December 2012
Spartacus," Exciting Kubrick epic
","Epic tale of slave revolt against the Roman empire is grandly filmed by Kubrick with an all-star cast. Douglas is well cast in the title role, Simmons is beautiful as fellow slave, and Laughton is great as usual as a senator. Ustinov, however, steals the film in his Oscar-winning role as a slave trainer. Gavin is given above-the-title billing but barely has five minutes of screen time. However, the film is too long at nearly three and half hours and, like the director's Barry Lyndon, would have benefited from tighter editing. Some of the scenes in Rome specially could have been trimmed. The early scenes in the training camp are the best although the battle scene is impressive. 8/10.",8,0,1,2 April 2006
United 93," Air Sickness
","Most of this atrocious film is devoted to air traffic controllers babbling on endlessly about possible hijackings. This is inter-cut with closeups of flight monitoring instrumentation. It's meant to convey urgency but it induces boredom and nausea. It's amazing that Greengrass was Oscar nominated for this as it is one of the most incompetent directorial efforts in recent memory. His shaky, hand-held camera is extremely distracting, making it difficult to focus on the film. Not only that, but he favors extreme closeups and whiplash-inducing camera movements that serve to make the action confusing. Somebody please take this hack's camera away. The 9/11 victims deserve better.",1,29,65,17 January 2010
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Stupid Alien Tricks
","Amazingly successful movie about a boy and his alien gets off to an OK start but becomes increasingly annoying, thanks to a stupid and overly sentimental script and Spielberg's manipulative yet amateurish direction. Even setting aside the alien story, the situations are so contrived that they insult the viewer's intelligence. ET seems to have been given random and contradictory features and powers. The federal authorities, who apparently don't say a word to each other, are basically like robots. The part where ET gets sick and the feds put on the astronaut suits is utterly ridiculous. Williams's score is memorable if overused to pull emotional strings.",6,0,2,30 November 2007
Casablanca," You Must Remember This
","It doesn't get much better than this drama about war time intrigue and romance. Bogart gives the best performance of his storied career in the quintessential role of the tough, cynical loner with a soft heart. Bergman is simply luminous. Henried does well in a thankless role. Rains nearly steals the film as a crooked but lovable police inspector. The script has more memorable lines than any other, the cinematography is crisp, and nobody sings 'As Time Goes By' like Wilson. Curtiz, an underrated director, deserves much of the credit for the iconic images of this unforgettable classic. Thankfully, to paraphrase a line from the film, we'll always have 'Casablanca.'",10,4,5,17 January 2010
Minority Report," Tedious
","Silly science fiction movie about a man who is on the run from the cops trying to defend himself against a crime he is supposed to commit in the future. He's in trouble because three women in a swimming pool see future crimes. It all sounds preposterous and Spielberg has done nothing to make it any more interesting. In fact Spielberg is so absorbed with special effects that the convoluted and confusing plot seems to have been put on the back burner. With the plot failing to sustain interest and the characters difficult to identify with, the special effects become pretty tedious to watch very quickly. Cruise tries to look intense.",6,0,5,22 June 2006
Lifeboat," Tallulah!
","Engrossing drama about a group of survivors of a torpedo attack on a small boat. There is terrific ensemble acting by the whole cast, but the star of the film is Bankhead, playing a glamorous and flirtatious journalist. This marvelous actress worked mostly on the stage and did not have much success on the screen, with this film being her best by far. Although she did not have a particularly attractive face, she had a sensuous presence and a husky voice that oozed sex appeal. It's unfortunate that Hollywood could not take advantage of her talents. Although the entire film takes place on the boat, it never becomes tiresome, thanks to an engaging script, interesting characters, and Hitchcock's masterful direction.",8,2,2,9 August 2006
Training Day," Meandering and Ridiculous
","A rookie cop spends a day getting schooled in the ways of street life by a decorated narcotics officer. Washington, playing against type as the epitome of a bad cop, is so over the top that it is not surprising that he won an Oscar for this role. He is supposed to be charismatic but the character is not the least bit likable. The script starts off as meandering, with hardly any sustained narrative during the first half; it then crams in too much plot and ends up as unbelievably stupid, including a key scene that hinges on a silly coincidence. The action scenes are utterly ridiculous, with Fuqua not making any attempt to infuse credibility into them.",3,2,6,28 September 2010
In Bruges," A Hit
","After a botched job, two London hit men are sent to Bruges, Belgium to lay low for a while, unaware of what their evil boss has planned for them. A delightful black comedy, highlighted by the witty banter between Farrell and Gleeson, the hit men with contrasting interests. The two actors work well together and Fiennes is hilarious as their quick-tempered boss. The dramatic elements are somewhat weak and don't mesh very well with the comedy, and the last part of the film goes a bit too far with the violence. However, for the most part, this film is quite enjoyable. A remarkable feature film debut for McDonagh, who wrote and directed.",8,1,3,3 April 2009
Chinatown," Polanski's Peak
","Nicholson is ideally cast as a private detective in the mold of Philip Marlowe who's drawn into a mysterious web of murder, politics, and corruption. Dunaway gives perhaps the best performance of her career as the tormented Femme Fatale with a secret past. The fine supporting cast includes Huston as a menacing patriarch. This is the best film on Polanski's impressive resume and he beautifully evokes 1930s L.A. with a film noir look composed of muted colors, perfectly complemented by Goldsmith's moody score and Towne's Oscar-winning script. The director also has a memorable cameo as a knife-wielding heavy. A haunting masterpiece.",9,1,3,8 June 2006
To Be or Not to Be," Lombard's Curtain Call
","An acting troupe joins the resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Poland. This is a scathing farce masterfully directed by the incomparable Lubitsch, one of the earliest anti-Nazi films. It's hard to watch this without thinking about Lombard's tragic death soon after filming was completed. She shows for the final time why she was one of the premier comediennes of the silver screen, delivering laughs with her uncanny timing and delivery. Benny has the role of his career as the hammy actor whose love for Lombard is exceeded only by his love for himself. Lubitch not only provides sparkling comedy but also adeptly executes the action scenes.",9,1,3,29 December 2010
Fight Club," The Joys of Sado-Masochism
","A man tired of his yuppie condo and dead-end job moves into a dilapidated house with a stranger and starts an underground club where young men beat each other up to bloody pulp just for the fun of it. When that becomes old, they engage in terrorist activities. There is a lame plot twist, which should not surprise most viewers, that blows the story full of holes and turns the movie from merely bad to abominably bad, culminating in a laughably ludicrous finale. The message of this paean to sado-masochism is that a man has to suffer and inflict pain on others in order to...sell tickets. What is most disturbing is that many consider this vile piece of garbage to be a masterpiece, a sad reflection of our society.",1,13,37,9 July 2007
Citizen Kane," Admirable
","Is this the greatest film of all time? No, but it is certainly one of the greatest, an audacious film debut for boy genius Welles. In fact, Welles perhaps goes a little overboard with his showy camera angles and juxtapositioning of lights and shadows. This is such a groundbreaking film, however, that he can be forgiven for his excesses. Toland's magnificent deep-focus cinematography adds to the visual elegance of the film. Welles does fine in the title role, although he was never a great actor. Cotten is terrific as one of Kane's friends, particularly in his scenes as an old man. Despite all its greatness, however, it is a film to be admired rather than loved.",10,1,2,4 September 2009
Memento," Muddled
","A man is determined to avenge the murder of his wife, but his mission is complicated by the fact that he suffers from short-term memory loss. The film is unique in that it tells the story backwards, starting at the end and moving to the beginning scene by scene. The purpose of this narrative device is to let the viewer experience what the protagonist is going through. It may have seemed like a clever idea on paper, but it makes for a muddled and unsatisfying film. The plot is preposterous and there are too many loose ends. Nolan seems more interested in propagating a gimmick than in telling a compelling story. It's not bad, but it's really not worth the trouble. Pearce is good.",6,1,4,28 December 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious Film-making
","During WWII, a crack Jewish outfit seeks revenge against the Nazis in occupied France. This is a good-looking film, marked by sumptuous cinematography and a fine score. There are good performances from Pitt, Laurent, and Kruger, but the film belongs to Waltz, who is mesmerizing as a cold, calculating Nazi officer with polite manners. Tarantino is a fine story-teller and he is at his best in seemingly mundane scenes where tension builds, such as the scenes in the farm house and the tavern. What holds his films back is his sick obsession with graphic violence. Fortunately, there are only a few minutes of that here. Despite its epic length, this film does not drag for a moment.",9,0,4,9 April 2010
Shakespeare in Love," Fluffy Romance
","In this romantic comedy-drama, Shakespeare falls in love with a young woman and is inspired to write 'Romeo and Juliet.' The period is nicely evoked and it is a pleasant enough film, although hardly worthy of the Best Picture Oscar. The weighty subject matter makes it appear to be more than the fluff that it is. Paltrow radiates charm and does a decent British accent. In the silly tradition of Clark Kent and his glasses, she puts on a mustache and nobody recognizes her, including her lover. Fiennes is OK if a bit too brooding as the bard. It's strange seeing Affleck among the fine cast of British actors, but he does not embarrass himself. Dench hams it up as Queen Elizabeth.",7,0,1,30 December 2011
The Hunger Games," Repulsively Ridiculous
","In a dystopian future, the government picks youngsters to engage in a fight to death. The premise of the film and the source novel is repulsively ridiculous. Not only are kids forced to brutally fight each other, but the event is televised for the pleasure of the masses. Seriously? What kind of society gets its entertainment by watching children kill each other? What point is being made here? If one looks past the silly and disturbing premise, however, it is an entertaining action film for the most part. Lawrence is OK as the surly heroine, but all the characters are strictly one-dimensional. Tucci hams it up as the TV host of the games, unable to contain his glee over the violence, likely reflecting the view of the filmmakers.",6,5,11,20 July 2013
Mississippi Burning," Explosive Drama
","Two FBI agents go to Mississippi in 1964 to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights activists. Based on true events, this is an absorbing drama about one of the most explosive chapters of American history. Hackman is terrific as an agent who doesn't condone the racism, but understands the culture of hatred, having grown up in the South himself. Dafoe is equally good as a young agent who struggles to reconcile his idealistic views about justice with the reality he confronts. McDormand is also fine as the good wife of a redneck sheriff. Parker wisely uses a documentary approach to infuse the events with a sense of authenticity.",8,2,2,12 August 2011
Au Revoir les Enfants," Underwhelming
","Like most people, Malle had an uneventful childhood as he attended a boarding school in France. Unlike most people, Malle felt a need to make a movie about this rather dull period of his life. There is nothing very interesting about watching boys going through their daily routines at school. There is no plot, just random episodes that fail to sustain a narrative flow. There's an extended scene where the two main characters are separated from their troop while playing a game in the woods. It seems like it's building up to something dramatic, but it just fizzles out. The final scene is powerful, but does not warrant having to sit through the rest of this underwhelming drama.",4,8,22,7 August 2011
The Impossible," Impossibly Inept
","This drama looks at the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami on a British family vacationing in Thailand. Although based on a true story, this is an unbelievably melodramatic film that feels contrived, with every plot point staged for maximum emotional impact. One of the problems is the singular focus on a tourist family. With all the devastation to the locals, it is hard to sympathize with the plight of an affluent white family. Poorly scripted and directed, it is shamefully manipulative, going for cheap emotions at every turn. Watts and McGregor are decent actors but can't overcome the material they have to work with here. The victims of the tragedy deserve something better than this inept homage.",4,15,30,16 June 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Mild Spoof
","In this spoof of 'Dawn of the Dead,' London is under siege by zombies as a sales clerk heroically attempts to lead his family and friends to safety. The film wants to have it both ways - be a gory horror film and be a comedy, with the result being mild amusement. The funniest moments are the TV reports about zombies and the best way to deal with them. While the concept is initially somewhat funny in that understated British humor style, it soon runs of steam and goes on far too long. Pegg, who co-wrote the screenplay, makes a good nerdy hero. Somehow this middling comedy has achieved the same kind of cult status as the film it is spoofing.",7,0,1,5 December 2009
Argo," Exiting but Contrived
","In this dramatization of the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, a CIA agent devises a plan to rescue six Americans. While not Oscar worthy, this is an exciting look at the daring plan that was classified until recently. Afleck is turning into a competent director, but he should hold on to his acting gig for now. He and the writers go a bit overboard here in trying to add excitement to the historical events. Although the film is shot in a documentary style and implies authenticity, the final act is too contrived in building up the suspense to be believable as a true depiction. The acting is pretty good, with Arkin and Goodman coming off best as a couple of Hollywood personalities involved in the rescue mission.",7,0,2,7 April 2013
12 Angry Men," Best jury movie ever
","A Hispanic teen is accused of killing his father. Tweleve jurors are sequestered to decide the kid's fate. The jurors take a vote before beginning deliberations and all but one vote guilty. So begins this highly engrossing drama based on a play. Directing his first feature film, Lumet does a fantastic job of building the tension, with virtually all the action taking place inside a steamy jury room. As the calming voice of reason, Fonda leads a great cast, a motley crew of jurors composed of characters from all walks of life: the meek (Fieldler), the hothead (Cobb), the thoughtful old man (Sweeney), the poor (Klugman), the disinterested (Webber). We get to know each juror over the course of the movie as Fonda makes the case for a reasonable doubt. Not to be missed.",10,0,1,12 April 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Engaging adventure film
","Fine adventure film based on C. S. Lewis novel about two brothers and two sisters who magically enter a land where they must join forces with a lion king to fight an evil queen. The unknown actors who play the children are all quite capable without trying to be too cute. Swinton is perfect as the cold-blooded ice queen. The director keeps the story moving along at a good pace, as we are introduced to strange characters such as talking beavers and creatures that are half-horse/half-man. There may be some theological undertones but the movie, to its credit, does not dwell on them. Ultimately, however, the story gets pretty absurd, specially with the events concerning the lion.",7,0,1,9 April 2006
Elizabeth," Royal Failure
","Given that the filmmakers have taken liberties with historical facts in this account of the rise to power in England of Elizabeth I, it is surprising how dull the script is. It's also quite muddled, making it a chore to figure out who's doing what to whom. Blanchett is fine in the title role and is ably supported by Rush. Fiennes is underwhelming as the queen's lover. Kapur's amateurish camera work, particularly the overuse of overhead shots, doesn't help matters. Despite his indulgent attempts to call attention to himself, he remains one of only a handful of directors of Best Picture Oscar nominees not to be nominated for Best Director. At least the costumes are colorful.",4,4,6,3 May 2009
Ted," Unbearable
","A grown man lives with a talking teddy bear, which makes his girlfriend unhappy. The stuffed toy not only talks, but he spews profanity, drinks beer, smokes pot, and is sex-crazed. Isn't that hilarious? This movie is for those who find this concept irresistibly funny. The keyword here is 'concept,' because other than being foul-mouthed, the little guy doesn't say anything funny. The dialog and situations are painfully lacking in humor and the film goes on much too long. Not only is Macfarlane's script lacking in wit, but he wallows in phony sentimentality and sappy romance, making it unbearable. Wahlberg is a limited actor who is not suited to dumb comedies. He should stick with dumb action movies.",3,4,9,9 March 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," Intriguing but Sloppy
","A retired Argentinian federal agent writes a book based on his recollections of a 25-year old unsolved murder case. Darin and Villamil give good performances as government co-workers whose relationship is fraught with unconsummated sexual tension. It is an intriguing story, but the execution is sloppy. There are too many loose ends and the plot elements pertaining to the murder suspect are so ludicrously contrived in terms of how he is targeted, caught, and convicted that it's hard to take this film seriously. Furthermore, after all the buildup, the conclusion is rather underwhelming. It's not a bad film by any means, but it falls far short of its lofty reputation.",7,5,8,28 December 2010
Billy Elliot," Sentimental and Manipulative
","Against the wishes of his tough father, an 11-year old boy in an English mining town dreams of being a ballet dancer. There are fine performances from Walters as the local ballet teacher and Lewis as the father who thinks his son is a sissy. Bell does well as the little boy with happy feet. Daldry displays a visual elegance, but does not always succeed in balancing the parallel stories of Billy and the coal miner's strike. Ultimately the film becomes too sentimental and manipulative, grabbing every opportunity to tug at the viewer's heartstrings. It also advances the stereotype of male ballet dancers being gay. It's well made for what it is, but what is is sappy and predictable.",7,1,2,5 December 2009
Black Book," Good Book
","In Nazi-occupied Netherlands, a Jewish woman becomes a spy for Resistance fighters. The story has a familiar feel to it and is somewhat simplistic and unbelievable, but manages to be interesting nonetheless after a meandering beginning. It goes on a bit too long but doesn't really drag. van Houten is quite effective as the Dutch woman who changes her identity and appearance to pass herself off as a non-Jew. The supporting cast is pretty good. Verhoeven, who has a tendency to impose style over substance in films like 'The Fourth Man,' is surprisingly restrained here, letting the story unfold without overwhelming it.",8,1,3,3 April 2009
Superbad," Amusing but Overlong
","Nerdy high-schoolers attempt to get in with the hip crowd by promising to supply booze for a party. The cops played by Hader and Rogen are funny, particularly in their first appearance as they investigate a robbery. Other comic highlights include the whole business with the fake ID and the somewhat disturbing segment about young Hill's obsession with the male organ. While it has many amusing moments, it goes on much too long for a comedy. The filmmakers attempt to make the scenes of male bonding touching, but they are rather contrived and lame. It's also hard to buy that a young woman like Stone will have anything to do with someone like Hill.",7,0,2,4 July 2010
The Great Dictator," Great Chaplin
","The eerie resemblance between Chaplin's Little Tramp character and Hitler is used to good advantage in this satire. Chaplin waited until this 1940 film to make his first talkie and much of his dialog is gibberish! However, comedy is the universal language and there is much here that is quite amusing. One of the iconic scenes has Chaplin playing with a gas-filled globe, as he contemplates world domination. The scene goes on a bit too long, however, as does the film in general before concluding with an unnecessarily preachy speech. Despite some heavy-handedness, Chaplin is to be applauded for bringing attention to Hitler's atrocities before they became widely known.",8,1,2,7 January 2010
The Others," Creepy but Poorly Paced
","A woman living in a dreary old house with her two small children encounters strange phenomena. The film has a very creepy atmosphere, which is good except that it's all atmosphere. Nothing much happens through most of the film and the pacing is excruciatingly slow. One can sense a twist coming at the end, but the end can't come soon enough. When it comes, the twist turns out to be fairly clever, but the payoff is not worth the time spent getting there. Kidman's performance is very mannered initially and over the top later. Flanagan is quite striking as the old maid. Basically, the film has a good premise but the execution leaves much to be desired.",5,1,2,28 September 2010
Ed Wood," Witless and Tiresome
","This biography of the unbelievably incompetent director of such atrocities as 'Glen or Glenda' and 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' is meant to be a comedy but it's not funny. Depp brings a lot of energy to the title role, although he seems to be basically doing an impression of Billy Crystal. What, Billy wasn't available? Landau is OK as Bela Lugosi, but it's hardly a performance worthy of an Oscar. Burton operates under the premise that watching an idiot at work is so entertaining that no real plot is necessary. And he's right - for about ten minutes. After that it becomes tiresome and goes on far too long. In a small bit, D'Onofrio does an uncanny impression of Orson Welles.",6,3,7,11 December 2009
The Hustler," Depressing
","This film about a pool hustler features gritty cinematography and good acting. However, it is a depressing ode to gambling and drinking. The acting by Newman, Gleason, Laurie, and Scott is good but this is a tough movie to sit through, especially given its excessive length. Much of the film is devoted to the relationship between Newman and Laurie. The problem is that neither character is likable or interesting. He is basically an arrogant jerk. She is a depressed alcoholic with very low self-esteem. Rossen, a writer who directed only ten films, takes this material much too seriously. All the characters take turns giving their big speeches about life. It's no fun.",7,3,6,10 September 2009
Juno," Calculated but Entertaining
","A pregnant teen thinks about having an abortion, but then agrees to let a childless yuppie couple adopt the baby. This is generally entertaining but seems too calculated to be a genuine comedy-drama. Juno is meant to be an endearing young woman but she seems artificial. She's too much of a smart-ass for a sixteen-year-old, too nonchalant about the pickle she's gotten herself into, delivering one-liners like a stand-up comedian. It appears the filmmakers are trying too hard to be hip, but end up with something that feels like an after-school special. Page, Cera, Garner, Bateman, Janney, and Simmons all deliver good performances.",7,2,8,28 September 2010
L.A. Confidential," Neo Noir
","Ihe early 1950s, the L.A. police department, rampant with corruption, tackles the sleazy underbelly of the city. The film focuses on three different types of cops played by Spacey, Crowe, and Pearce, and all three actors turn in fine performances, along with Basinger, who won an Oscar for playing a prostitute who's a Veronica Lake look-alike. The set pieces and cinematography effectively evoke the period. It recalls the great film noirs of the 1940s. And like some of those classics ('The Big Sleep,' for instance), the plot is a bit too convoluted, although everything eventually becomes clear. Mainly, however, it's about the ambiance, and the film succeeds in capturing a mood.",8,0,1,4 July 2010
Match Point," Game, Set, and Match to Mr. Allen
","Woody's first film outside New York is like a breath of fresh air. Here he revisits the dramatic landscape of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' with shades of 'Crime and Punishment' and 'A Place in the Sun.' However, he masterfully blends all these familiar themes into something his very own, thanks to a clever script. Rhys Meyers, who played Elvis Presley earlier and certainly resembles him, is fine as a social-climbing tennis pro caught between two women. Johansson looks ravishing as the object of his affection and she gives a terrific performance as the other woman. In weaving his intriguing tale, Allen generates some suspenseful moments that would do Hitchcock proud.",8,4,6,25 June 2006
Zodiac," Rambling Thriller
","Based on true events in late 1960s and early 1970s, a cartoonist for a San Francisco newspaper becomes obsessed with finding the Zodiac killer. The film moves in fits and starts as the detectives investigating the crime pursue one fruitless lead after another. Although fascinating initially, this approach becomes somewhat tiresome after a while, especially considering the running time of nearly three hours. This one could have benefited from tighter editing. There are good performances from Ruffalo and Edwards as detectives, Downey as an alcoholic reporter, and Gyllenhaal as the cartoonist, whose book is the basis for the rambling screenplay.",7,1,2,9 April 2010
The Prestige," Muddled Magic
","A couple of magicians develop a heated rivalry around the start of the 20th century in London. Nolan has a nice visual flair but can't elicit good performances from his big-name cast. The acting of Jackman and Bale, the latter sporting a bad English accent, may be kindly described as average. Caine fares better, although he seems to be still playing Batman's butler. Johansson is wasted in a negligible role. The script is so contrived, muddled, disjointed, and utterly ridiculous, and the characters are so poorly developed, that one doesn't care who wins the rivalry. It's a dull and long-winded story with an unsatisfying conclusion.",5,1,4,10 August 2008
The Terminator," Top-Notch Sci-Fi
","This is one of the best sci-fi films, with Schwarzenegger traveling back in time to kill the mother of a future revolutionary. The plot doesn't holdup too well on scrutiny, but that's why it's called science fiction. Arnold makes one of filmdom's meanest villains and gets to utter one of his famous lines, 'I'll be back.' Biehn is likable as the hero and Hamilton makes a lovely damsel in distress. Cameron, working with a small budget in only his second feature film as director, keeps the action moving at a break-neck pace as the tension mounts. It gets a little silly towards the end, but is quite entertaining for the most part.",8,0,1,3 August 2008
Catch-22," Lost in Translation
","The popular Heller novel is brought to the screen with an impressive all-star cast but something must have gotten lost in the translation because this one is painful to watch. Arkin is fine as a flier who tries to have himself declared insane so he doesn't have to fly. In fact, most of the cast is pretty good, with the exception of Balsam and Henry, who are annoying. Henry also gets the blame for the disjointed, rambling screenplay. Nichols has a made a number of good films and one enduring classic, 'The Graduate,' but when he is off he is infuriating. Here, he is way off, creating a lackluster mixture of uninspired comedy and indulgent, pretentious drama.",4,1,3,3 September 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Stars Shine
","This phenomenally successful Western about lovable bank robbers made Redford into a star and spawned a drove of buddy-buddy movies. The main attraction here is the chemistry and the witty banter between Newman and Redford, which is so enjoyable that it makes up for Hill's pretentious direction. Ross's role is so inconsequential that she shouldn't have bothered to show up. The plot is very thin and the film has little rhythm to it. The 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head' sequence is silly, and the long montage of still pictures before they head to Bolivia kills the film's momentum. This film is the antithesis of 'The Wild Bunch,' the great Western released the same year.",8,0,1,7 July 2008
Crash," A portrait of L.A. in black and white
","Similar to Robert Altman's Short Cuts, this film features a set of interweaving stories in L.A. against a backdrop of racial tension. Some of the stories are more interesting than others. For example, the plot line concerning the locksmith and the Persian shop owner is compelling whereas the one about the black cop and his mother is not well developed. Some of the situations seem forced just to make a point. The transformation of the Bullock character from a whiny, racist bitch to Mother Teresa following a tumble down the stairs is unconvincing. The shooting of the black kid by the good white cop also rings false. However, excellent ensemble acting by all makes this worth watching.",8,0,1,8 April 2006
Snatch," Jolly Good
","A hodgepodge of plot lines comprise this comedy about the low-lifes of London, featuring characters such as 'Franky Four Fingers' and 'Boris the Blade.' Ritchie's followup to 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is far superior because he has much better script to work with. As with the earlier film, Ritchie goes a little overboard with his hyperactive camera-work, but is not as distracting because of the amusing situations and funny dialog. The running joke is that nobody can understand boxer Pitt's Irish Gypsy accent; ironically, to those outside Britain, it is hard to understand what most of the characters are saying. Thank heavens for subtitles.",8,1,2,7 July 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Cold War as Comedy
","An unstable general initiates the doomsday scenario by ordering a nuclear attack against the Soviet Union. Filled with quotable lines and memorable characters, this is the ultimate black comedy, finding absurdist humor in a deadly serious subject, especially relevant when the cold war was raging. Kubrick's stark, documentary style contrasts perfectly with the comic proceedings, creating a sense of uneasiness. Sellers is excellent playing three characters, including the title role of a mad scientist. Scott is hilarious as a war hawk general. Hayden has the role of his career as the demented general railing against the 'Russkies.' Pickens and Wynn round out the superb cast.",9,1,2,7 January 2010
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," It's a Wrap
","The second trilogy (or first, depending on how you look at it) concludes with a bang. Unlike the open-ended and unsatisfying 'The Empire Strikes Back,' this one wraps up the loose ends. While there is plenty of action, the film goes on too long and there are too many annoying creatures, not to mention the unbearable robots C3PO and R2D2. Yoda makes a cameo appearance. It's also pointless to have some of the creatures speak English while others speak in some alien tongue with subtitles. Is this meant to depict some kind of realism? The battle scenes are well executed and exciting, although they do tend to become repetitive.",8,0,1,31 December 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Alice in Labyrinth
","This fairy tale with parallels to 'Alice in Wonderland' has a little girl encountering bizarre characters in an alternate universe. The cinematography is quite impressive and del Toro displays a fine visual flair. However, the script is too random and contrived to be interesting and the characters are one-dimensional. The captain, for example, is pure evil, lacking a single redeeming character; his wife is a whiny weakling. The film intersperses the fairy tale with the account of the fascist army fighting insurgents, but the two threads don't complement each other. It's like watching two movies. del Toro's obsession with stomach-churning violence doesn't help matters.",5,24,48,7 January 2010
The Way Back," Random and Contrived
","During WWII, a group of men escapes a Siberian prison and heads towards the Himalayas. Inexplicably, we are told at the outset that only three will reach their destination. So much for suspense. The 1950s book that the film is based on was presented as factual but has since been proved to be fictional. The plot is too random and contrived to sustain interest. The characters speak multiple languages and subtitles are provided when they are not speaking English. However, through much of the film, the actors (with the exception of Harris) speak English in heavy European accents without subtitles, making it very hard to understand what they are saying.",6,2,4,30 December 2011
Knocked Up," Lame Comedy, Clichéd Drama
","The inexplicable premise here is that a pretty and successful young woman chooses to have a one-night stand with an overweight, unemployed, pot-smoking doofus. Not only that, but after becoming pregnant, she wants to spend eternity with this loser. Furthermore, rather than being thankful for having snared a babe who's clearly out of his league, the unattractive slob lashes out at her. Although marketed as a comedy, the film really strives to be a penetrating and touching drama about relationships, but fails miserably due to stereotyped characters and a clichéd plot. Apatow's idea of humor is to insert the f-word into every line of dialog. Comedy or drama, the excessive length makes it drag.",4,3,5,1 May 2010
Alien," Suspenseful, Old-Fashioned Thriller
","A strange being gets on board a spaceship and starts knocking off the crew one by one. This is an old-fashioned thriller along the lines of 'And Then There were None,' except that the creepy mansion has been replaced by a futuristic spaceship. It starts off rather slow, but kicks into overdrive once the alien gets on board. The creature's entrance is one of the most startling scenes in horror film history. In only his second feature film, Scott's direction is superb, extracting every ounce of suspense from the situation. Weaver gives a star-making performance as the tough but feminine and sexy Ripley. The supporting cast is fine, particularly Skerritt, Cartwright, and Kotto.",9,1,3,1 November 2008
The Best Years of Our Lives," One of the Best Films of Our Lives
","WWII veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life. This superb drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer Toland. Despite its near three-hour length, it does not drag for a minute. The script by Sherwood features very human characters and great dialog. Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Also good are Wright as a love-sick young woman, Mayo as Andrews' trampy wife, and real-life veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands. However, top honors go to March and Loy as a long-married couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other.",10,13,14,5 February 2007
The Town," Routine Crime Drama
","Four friends rob banks in a Boston suburb while the FBI is in pursuit. The plot is routine and mostly uninteresting. These guys keep robbing banks and armored cars as if they have no money. It is not clear why they keep taking risks rather than living comfortably with the loot they have accumulated. Afleck seems mostly preoccupied with getting the Boston accent down, with the result being a monotonous performance. Hamm does his acting through his stubble. Renner comes off best, playing Afleck's hot-tempered buddy. It's illogical that Afleck would become romantically involved with a woman that he held hostage. The action scenes feel stale and drawn out.",6,0,5,12 February 2011
Taxi Driver," Violent Fare
","A lonely, disillusioned taxi driver is disgusted by the filth he sees around him in NYC and decides to take matters into his own hands. As with his other films, Scorsese does a fine job of capturing the seedy side of NYC, helped tremendously by a moody score by Herrmann, who died before release. Although the film is told entirely from the point of view of the driver (well played by De Niro), we are given few clues as to what makes him tick or what pushes him over the edge. It shows the actions of a disturbed man but does not explore his psyche. Scorsese's overly busy camera work is a distraction at times. Ultimately, the film falls short because it glorifies violence and pushes a fascist agenda.",7,0,0,7 January 2010
Shutter Island," Intriguing Thriller
","During the 1950s, a U.S. marshal investigates the disappearance of an inmate at a facility for the criminally insane on a remote island. This film has has all the elements for a good, old-fashioned thriller (rain, fog, creepy old buildings, sinister characters, mysterious events), and while it sputters here and there, it ultimately delivers the goods. In somewhat of a departure from his usual fare, Scorsese creates a haunting atmosphere, helped by the fine cinematography and a clever, intriguing screenplay. Heading a good cast, DiCaprio is convincing as an earnest cop who becomes emotionally involved in his assignment, one that becomes a journey of self-discovery.",8,0,2,9 July 2010
Life of Pi," Pretty but Pointless
","After his ship is hit by a storm, a young Indian man finds himself adrift on a boat with a tiger. The cinematography is so dazzling that Lee won an Oscar for this, one of the few instances where a director has won without the film winning Best Picture. Unfortunately, Lee is better with the special effects than with the actors, whose performances are uneven at best. While the movie looks great, like pretty postcards, the script, based on a popular novel, is too weak to sustain interest. The story, disjointed and somewhat clumsily structured with flashbacks, is fantastic and nonsensical, and ultimately pointless. The characters are meant to be wise and worldly but come across as shallow caricatures.",5,8,13,8 June 2013
Full Metal Jacket," Riveting
","A look at a few months in the life of a group of marines from boot camp to the battle front in Vietnam. Kubrick's depiction of basic training is riveting, perhaps the best ever put on film, as the tension builds slowly but surely. In fact, these camp scenes are so good that once the action shifts to the war zone, it is somewhat of a letdown, as the film flounders aimlessly for a while. However, it then finishes with a bang. Kubrick's presentation of platoon life is far more interesting than what Oliver Stone offered in 'Platoon' the previous year. Modine heads a good cast of young actors. Ermey is excellent as the drill instructor.",8,0,1,31 December 2008
Forrest Gump," Whole is Less Than Sum of Parts
","Dumb luck allows a moron to be present during numerous historical events and to become fabulously rich. This film consists of numerous amusing episodes that don't add up to a satisfactory whole. There is so much emphasis on cleverly incorporating Gump into historic moments that the narrative flow suffers. As such, the skits become tiresome after a while, especially given the excessive length of the movie. Hanks's performance is interesting but overdone, as he shifts from robotic to goofy to emotional, making Gump not so much a character as a caricature. The effects showing Gump interacting with the likes of JFK, LBJ, Nixon, and John Lennon are well done.",7,0,3,31 December 2010
Gone Baby Gone," Effective Affleck
","Police and private detectives investigate the disappearance of a little girl in Boston. A surprisingly effective directorial debut for Affleck, who creates a grim atmosphere and elicits good performances from his cast, particularly brother Casey as a tough detective and Harris as a grizzled cop. However, Ryan steals the film in a standout performance as the mother of the missing girl, a floozy of a woman. Because of the setting and genre, it invites comparisons to 'Mystic River' and 'The Departed.' It's not as good as either of those, but is an absorbing film nevertheless. One complaint is that the actors, especially Affleck, tend to mumble, necessitating subtitles.",7,1,2,16 March 2009
The Godfather: Part II," Best Sequel Ever
","This, perhaps the greatest sequel ever, tells the parallel stories of Michael's struggles as the new Godfather and the rise of the legendary Vito Corleone. The presentation of Vito's story is particularly impressive, with DeNiro in a fine performance. Michael's story tends to bog down at times but never fails to be compelling. Pacino is terrific, as are Duvall, Cazale, and Strasberg. The cinematography is beautiful and Rota builds on his memorable score from the first film. Coppola pushes all the right buttons, letting the stories unfold majestically. Having made the two Godfather films by age 35, the talented director had nowhere to go but down.",10,3,4,27 December 2008
Fargo," Coens Masterpiece
","A man hires a couple of goons to kidnap his wife so he can split with them the ransom that her father will pay. Of course, nothing goes as planned. The Coen Brothers are in peak form here - from the clever script to the marvelous visual presentation of the bleak Minnesota winter. In fact, they have yet to surpass this superb black comedy. Buscemi and Stormare are hilarious as the kidnappers with opposite personalities. Macy is perfectly cast as the schmuck who hires the kidnappers. McDormand won a well deserved Oscar for her spot-on performance as a pregnant policewoman. Even minor characters (such as the hookers) are memorable and the score is terrific.",9,0,0,4 September 2009
The Aviator," A Long Flight
","Overlong but generally engaging biography of the legendary Howard Hughes. DiCaprio is quite believable as the high-flying millionaire. Blanchett is also convincing as Katherine Hepburn. An all-star cast fills out the rest of the cast. This one could have used a good editor as Scorcese decides to give us a complete portrait of Hughes, warts and all, as in nearly three hours of ALL. The scenes of Hughes' withdrawal into a darkened room drag on way too long. The film is at its best in the early parts as Hughes starts his Hollywood career. There is a hilarious scene where Hughes has Prof. Fritz (Holm) explain to the censor's board why Jane Russell's breasts are not obscene.",8,3,4,11 August 2006
Léon: The Professional," Clichéd and Contrived
","Clichés abound in this contrived thriller about a hit-man who ends up adopting a 12-year-old girl. As the orphan, Portman is wonderful in her film debut. As Leon, Reno does OK but his character is unbelievable and underdeveloped. It is hard to believe that Leon, an uneducated, dim-witted, child-like fellow who loves plants and drinks milk is also a cold-blooded killer. He tells Portman she shouldn't use foul language but teaches her how to kill people. What a guy! Oldman, who would play Beethoven in his next film, is horribly over-the-top as a Beethoven-loving psycho DEA agent. On the plus side, the score is nice and the celebrity impersonations by Portman and Reno are amusing.",6,10,21,28 June 2008
Burn After Reading," Laugh While Watching
","After the disappointing 'No Country for Old Men,' the Coen brothers come alive in this hilarious black comedy. The cast seems to be having a field day. Malkovich is a riot as a pompous, angry CIA agent who quits his job to write his memoirs. McDormand is rather touching as a woman determined to get plastic surgery while Clooney playfully spoofs his leading man image. Pitt steals the film as a dim-witted blackmailer. The script is absurdly clever and the dialog is full of zingers. Perhaps the most amusing scenes involve CIA agent Rasche trying to explain to superior Simmons what the heck is going on with the multitude of characters and subplots.",8,1,6,16 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Forgettable
","A wounded man is pulled out of the sea by fishermen who help him recuperate, but he suffers from amnesia and doesn't know why people are trying to kill him. The first in a series of films based on Ludlum novels is slick but silly. The pickles that Bourne gets out of are more ludicrous than a James Bond film. The silly stunts would be fun if, like Bond, the film didn't take itself so seriously, but this a humorless affair. Damon is rather one-dimensional as the hero. The quirky camera work that worked well for director Liman in 'Go,' his enjoyable 1999 comedy, is not suited to this drab endeavor. What's more, it rambles on too long.",5,1,2,9 April 2010
The Killing Fields," Tedious and Long-Winded
","The first hour or so feels like an overlong documentary about the war in Cambodia. There's no rhyme or reason to the narrative. It's just a random collection of scenes depicting a country in turmoil, and it becomes tedious. Joffe used the same heavy-handed and long-winded approach in his next film, 'The Mission.' Ngor is likable and sympathetic as the Cambodian journalist. The same can't be said of Waterston, who basically comes across as whiny, humorless, and self-centered as the New York Times writer whose memoir is the basis for the film. Malkovich is notable in only his second film. Surprisingly, there are long scenes with Cambodian dialog but no subtitles.",6,3,7,7 August 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Lord of Tedium
","An important ring must be destroyed to save the Universe or at least the Middle Earth part of it. Frodo could just flush it down a toilet and be done with it but then the story couldn't be dragged out to ten hours over three films. Tolkien's big story is brought to the screen in a big way by Jackson. The plot is pretty ridiculous but could have been made into an enjoyable film by someone who does not take himself as seriously as Jackson. The plot unfolds in tedious detail as we meet an assortment of strange characters, human and otherwise. The monster in the cave is laughably bad, befitting a 1950s Japanese movie. All the actors try to look dignified, as if they were filming a Shakespeare tragedy, instead of this hokum.",5,1,2,7 May 2006
The Thing," Disgusting
","An alien with the ability to take the forms of humans and animals infiltrates a scientific outpost in the Antarctic. This big-budget remake of the 1951 film proves that bigger isn't better, marred by poor acting, directing, and script. Carpenter thinks that slimy creatures and graphic mutilations are entertaining, but it's just disgusting. There is no subtlety at work here. This film has parallels to 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (the original) and 'Alien,' but one of the reasons it falls far short of those landmark sci-fi classics is that there's little build-up of suspense. The characters are one-dimensional. It's all about special effects.",4,10,22,9 August 2011
American Psycho," After Good Start, Falls Apart
","During the 1980s, a Wall Street yuppie leads an alternate life as a serial killer. This starts out as a delicious black comedy, with Bale delivering a terrific performance as a man who is not only a cold-blooded killer but a connoisseur of pop music. It's quite amusing listening to him analyze the music of Huey Louis and Whitney Houston. Unfortunately, the film falls apart down the stretch. Harron's direction is crisp, but the screenplay fails to reach a satisfactory conclusion, perhaps a difficult feat to pull off given the nature of the source novel. There are too many loose ends and the ending is much too ambiguous.",7,0,1,17 July 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," Little is right
","Film about a family heading west to have their little girl participate in a beauty contest is entertaining but hardly the great film many have made it out to be and lacks originality. The plot seems to be a reworking of 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' including the routine about the dead grandparent in the car, except that the humor is darker and it's not as funny as the Chevy Chase movie. The cast is good, particularly Arkin in his Oscar-winning role of the foul-mouthed patriarch. Breslin is cute without being cloying. The plot is far-fetched and predictable and the characters are basically caricatures. It's amusing enough but how could it possibly get nominated for Best Picture Oscar?",7,1,3,7 March 2007
North by Northwest," Hitchcock in Peak Form
","Probably no director has made such masterpieces back to back as 'Vertigo,' this film, and 'Psycho.' Although a bit long in the tooth, Grant is terrific as a man mistakenly drawn into a game of wits between the CIA and a group of spies. Saint is the ultimate icy blond, Mason makes an urbane villain, and Landau is creepy as Mason's sidekick. The dialog between Grant and Saint is surprisingly risqué for its time. Hitchcock keeps the action moving at a frenetic pace while building the suspense, helped by Hermann's marvelous score. The crop-dusting plane scene is justifiably famous, as is the finale atop Mount Rushmore. A masterful blend of action and comedy.",10,2,5,5 June 2008
Hugo," Good-Looking but Dreary
","After the deaths of his father and uncle, a little boy lives inside a big clock in a train station in 1930s Paris. In this visually opulent film, Scorsese pays homage to early cinema, but it's a case of all dressed up with nowhere to go. It lacks the script to make a compelling narrative out of the basic premise and it goes on much too long. The story of the automaton that the boy's father left to him is supposed to be touching, but it becomes dreary. There are too many shots of the machinery behind the clock. The subplot involving Cohen is supposed to be funny but comes across as lame. Kingsley is pretty good. It's good to see Lee still acting. Mortimer is wasted in a meaningless role.",5,2,7,26 December 2012
The Shining," Kubrick's Worst
","It is hard to believe that the man who made 'Paths of Glory' and 'Dr. Strangelove' could have created this nonsense. It starts off with a fairly interesting premise but soon turns south, thanks to a story that is silly and characters that are one-dimensional and under-developed. Nicholson's acting is way over the top with the only redeeming quality being that it's pretty funny at times. Duvall is at her bug-eyed, buck-toothed worst as Nicholson's simpering ninny of a wife. The blame for this must fall on Kubrick, as both actors have shown that they are capable of better performances. While visually opulent, the film is totally lacking in subtlety, a huge disappointment from a master filmmaker.",5,6,13,25 November 2006
American Beauty," American Ugly
","Much-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia, dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter's friend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious. Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is populated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches on what the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocre at best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves and awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best described as mugging. Benning does not fare much better as his desperate wife.",6,20,39,11 August 2006
Judgment at Nuremberg," Absorbing but Uneven
","This is a long-winded but absorbing drama about Nazi leaders being tried for war crimes. Mann's script raises some intriguing issues about law and morality. It features an impressive all-star, although everybody seems to be bucking for an Oscar. Except for Tracy and Dietrich, everybody has bursts of overacting. Schell is interesting to watch not because his is a great performance, but because he is so incredibly hammy. Clift is touching as a witness. Much of the blame for overacting must go to Kramer, who tends to be heavy-handed and theatrical. His direction of the courtroom scenes is frustrating to watch because of his ever-moving camera and amateurish zooms.",7,3,5,3 May 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator 2: The Remake
","Advertised as a sequel to 'The Terminator,' this feels more like a remake. Pretty much the same plot outline is rehashed except that it lacks the freshness and pacing of the original. Cameron does not seem to be as interested in telling a good story as in flaunting his special effects. The dialog is cheesy and the characters are caricatures. Sarah, a likable character in the original, has turned into a raving lunatic. John Connor is such an annoying little brat that one roots for him to be terminated. Arnold 2, playing puppy dog to the kid, is not nearly as interesting as Arnold 1. The final battle is dragged out way too long and the conclusion is corny.",5,2,9,25 September 2008
Duck Soup," Support Marxism
","Groucho becomes the leader of Freedonia and must deal with spies Chico and Harpo from a neighboring country. Not all the jokes are funny but there are a lot more hits than misses. There are many great lines, with Dumont being the target of many of Groucho's put-downs. However, the highlight is the silent gag where Groucho and Harpo look at each other in the 'mirror,' one of the funniest scenes in all of cinema. Unlike some of their other films, this one does not get bogged down by musical interludes. In fact, the song and dance routine where war is declared on Sylvania is quite amusing. With a running time of less than 70 minutes, this zany comedy does not overstay its welcome.",8,2,4,20 September 2006
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Then was better
","Coppola couldn't leave well enough alone. Redux adds an embarrassing scene where the Suzy-Q Playboy Bunnies sell their bodies for chopper fuel. There is also a long, boring episode at a French plantation where Sheen ends up sacking a Frenchwoman with an accent so thick that nary a word from her is comprehensible. Other scenes have also been expanded, making the film as bloated as Brando. However, the spectacular imagery remains intact, along with the soundtrack of classic 1960s songs and, in that rousing attack on the village, Wagner. Rather than improving the film, this overindulgent director's cut cancels out some of the positive qualities of the 1979 version, reducing the rating from 8 to 7.",7,1,2,12 May 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Unnecessary Remake
","A journalist teams up with a computer hacker to find a woman missing for 40 years. As Larsson's popular novel was made into a decent Swedish film two years earlier, was a Hollywood remake really necessary? Everything is overdone, starting with the ridiculous opening credits. It is poorly paced and goes on much too long, yet the plot is a bit murky at times. Craig does better in the role of the journalist than Nyqvist in the original film. As for the Lisbeth, the edge goes to Rapace, who wasn't particularly good in the original, but Mara is too robotic here. However, Lisbeth is such a one-note character that it would be difficult for any actress to make her anything more than a caricature.",6,3,4,26 December 2012
Being John Malkovich," Malkovich is marvelous
","A bizarre and deliciously inventive comedy. Cusack is excellent as a puppeteer who stumbles into a portal that leads to the head of John Malkovich. Keener is a delight as a woman that Cusack and wife Diaz are both attracted to. TV veterans Bean and Place provide good support. And nobody plays John Malkovich better than John Malkovich. His is a masterfully controlled performance that does not lapse into caricature. Like screenwriter Kaufman's 'Adaptation' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Minde,' this film is based on a far-fetched premise, but, whereas those two films fall apart after promising starts, the brilliance is sustained here. A good deal of the credit for that goes to Jonze.",8,3,5,27 May 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Amusing but Overlong
","The title says it all. Unfortunately, the filmmakers choose to belabor the point, taking nearly two hours to milk the concept for all it's worth. As a general rule, comedies should be closer to 90 minutes than two hours. There isn't enough material here to support such a long running time, spreading the joke thin. The film is intermittently amusing, thanks mostly to Carrell. The actor brings not only humor but also some humanity to the title role, overcoming Apatow's penchant for focusing on raunchiness and sophomoric comedy. Keener, a terrific actress who has been criminally underused in films, plays the woman who has the opportunity to rid our hero of his distinctive affliction.",7,0,1,28 September 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Misses the Mark
","A reporter in Iraq meets an Army specialist who comes from a crack unit that uses paranormal powers to subdue enemies...and goats. The premise sounds promising but the film fails to mine the situation for its comic potential. It would have been interesting to see what the Coen Brothers could have done with it. Alas, the man behind the camera is a TV actor making his film debut as director. Clooney excels at this sort of farce and his deadpan performance here is spot on, but he's just not given much to work with. Everything seems to be in place for a hilarious spoof, but the script is disjointed and there just aren't enough laughs. A good cast is wasted.",6,1,3,7 August 2011
Aliens," More the Merrier
","As the title indicates, this sequel to 'Alien' is literally more of the same. The plot is pretty much a rehash of the first film except that there are more characters and instead of a spaceship, the aliens do their terrorizing at a remote outpost in space. Cameron is good at this sort of thing and he keeps the action moving at a rapid pace while sustaining the level of suspense. On the negative side, it goes on a bit too long and the parallels to the original show a lack of imagination on the part of the writers. Weaver is fine reprising the role of Ripley. Reiser makes a good villain. Paxton provides the comic relief as a cowardly marine.",8,2,3,27 December 2008
The Exorcist," Souper Thriller
","This horror film about a girl possessed by the devil became a box office blockbuster. The acting is pretty good and Friedkin creates a chilling atmosphere. However, the story is quite silly. It is not so much a horror film as an exercise in gross effects, with pea soup playing a prominent role. In fact, some of Blair's antics are more comical than scary. The expository scenes are not very interesting, and the prologue in Iraq, while well filmed, does not fit in with the rest of the film. The plot has some holes, and even if one accepts the premise of possession, there is no logic to someone turning her head 360 degrees without dying. It's simply cheap thrills.",7,3,4,3 May 2009
Gandhi," Lavish Biopic
","This lavish production recounts the life and times of the great Indian leader over several decades. Attenborough tackles a biography of epic length and manages to make it interesting for the most part. Only in the final act, which focuses on the civil war between the Hindus and the Muslims, does the film run out of steam somewhat. Kingsley, who is half Indian, is nothing short of brilliant in the title role, providing an uncanny impersonation in terms of looks, vocals, and mannerisms of a man who espoused the power of non-violent resistance. In addition to Bergen and Martin as American journalists, the cast features cameos by a number of notable British actors.",8,0,2,9 August 2011
American History X," Absorbing Lesson
","A high school student idolizes his neo-Nazi older brother who is released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two black men. Norton is excellent in fleshing out a character who is scary because he is intelligent but filled with hate against minorities. Furlong gives a finely understated performance as his quiet younger brother. In fact, the entire cast does a good job, including D'Angelo as Norton's mother and Gould as a Jewish teacher subjected to Norton's venomous rage. A remarkable film debut for director Kaye, although his at-times overly flashy camera-work and use of extreme closeups for no apparent reason is distracting.",8,1,2,20 October 2008
Duck You Sucker," The Ugly
","Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a masterpiece. His other Westerns range from good ('The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly') to bad (the two 'Dollars' films) to ugly (this one). The opening shot has Steiger, doing an Eli Wallach impersonation by way of Strother Martin, relieving himself on a tree and goes downhill from there. It moves very slowly and lacks any drama, humor, or plot elements to sustain interest. Some scenes go on forever and the last hour of the movie becomes so dull and repetitious that it is almost unwatchable. Leone used extreme closeups to good effect in his earlier films but here he just goes overboard with it. Ugh!",2,16,36,4 October 2007
Enchanted," Fair Tale
","Cartoon characters jump into a well and emerge from a sewer under a busy street in live action New York City. This Disney fare borrows from other Disney movies as well as a number of other fish-out-of-water stories but manages to be fairly entertaining. Adams is charming as the modern Cinderella who must cope with a world where everything does not go as smoothly as in a fairy tale. Dempsey is given little to do but look handsome and he does it well enough. Sarandon has a small role as the wicked stepmother but she vamps it up. The squirrel is cute as are all the other animals. It's all very predictable, but that's what endears it to the kids to whom it is targeted.",7,0,1,12 April 2008
Die Hard 2," Here We Go Again
","A cop waiting at Washington's Dulles Airport happens to sniff out a plan to free a terrorist leader. The thinking on the part of the filmmakers was that the formula worked the first time so why change it? This sequel pretty much uses the template of the first film, with Willis again single-handedly taking on a team of bad guys. Even though they don't fit the story, a subplot involving Bedila and Atherton is squeezed in so as not to stray from the proved formula. As with the previous film, the plot is preposterously stupid but mostly entertaining. Willis looks very comfortable as the wise-cracking superhero and is fun to watch.",6,1,3,30 December 2011
Quantum of Solace," Not a Quantum of Fun
","In this 22th entry in the series and the second with Craig, Agent 007 is on a path of vengeance for the death of his girlfriend. A serious and angry Bond is no fun. Perhaps that's why this is the worst entry since 'License to Kill,' the last time it became personal for him as he sought those responsible for shooting his CIA buddy Felix Leiter. Leiter is fine now, except that he's turned into a black man. The action scenes are so poorly shot and edited that it's impossible to figure our who's doing what to whom. Unfortunately the first 30 minutes is all mindless action with no discernible plot. Craig's Bond is dour and charmless. One positive is that it's shortest film in the series.",5,15,21,9 April 2010
The Dirty Dozen," Dirty but Average
","A pretty good action film, it has Marvin leading a group of convicts on a mission to destroy a Nazi headquarter. The characters are clichÃ©s and some of the all-star cast hams it up but there are good performances from Marvin, Cassavetes, and Jaeckel. The early parts of the movie leading up to the mission are a little too drawn out, but the action picks up when the dozen reaches its target. Nobody in the group is likable to begin with and they become less endearing after their reprehensible actions against the Germans, which involves killing innocent women. The side plot involving the games between Marvin and Ryan is silly and receives too much focus.",7,0,3,7 October 2007
Gone with the Wind," Grand Entertainment
","The Mitchell novel becomes an unforgettable screen epic. This is grand entertainment featuring superb Technicolor cinematography, a memorable score, and lavish production values. Despite it's formidable length, it doesn't drag for a minute. However, it does become too melodramatic at times and the acting is uneven. Gable is charming, and de Havilland is fine, although her Melanie is so sweet that it's sickening. This film, however, belongs to Leigh, who is fabulous as the scheming Scarlett. Howard is totally miscast - too old, too plain-looking, too wimpy, and too British for anyone to believe that Scarlett would be obsessed with him.",8,0,1,9 August 2011
No Country for Old Men," Half-Baked
","From their very first film, the marvelous 'Blood Simple,' the Coen brothers have displayed a terrific visual style. This film is no exception, featuring some beautiful scenes as well as as some well-executed action. Unfortunately it's all style, no substance. It starts off well but is undone by a very unsatisfying denouement. Too much time is spent on Jones' opaque and uninteresting monologues. The plot is confusing and full of holes, with irrelevant characters wandering in and out who are not even introduced to the audience. It seems as if the Coens lost interest at some point and decided to release the film unfinished and rough around the edges. Quite disappointing.",6,3,8,4 April 2008
District 9," Subpar Sci-Fi
","Aliens land in Johannesburg and are kept in encampment for two decades before they start running amok. The first half an hour or so of this movie plays like a comedy - like a spoof of sci-fi films. It then turns into a silly sci-fi film that is mildly entertaining but rambles on much too long. The aliens are portrayed as thug-like and they look quite ridiculous. Apparently the film has some serious underlying message about apartheid and discrimination, but the plot is too silly to take anything here seriously. Even within the ground rules established by the film, the central plot device involving spaceship fuel makes no sense.",5,6,11,1 May 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Jesse Was Actually Bored to Death
","Even if one is not versed in history, the title gives away the ending so there's no suspense here. The point of the movie is the journey, but this one is so mind-numbingly boring that one has to repeatedly ask, 'Are we there yet?' About 13 hours into the movie, Robert finally shoots Jesse (hurray!). However, the film goes on for another three hours after that! In fact, it may still be playing. There are too many talking heads blabbering on and on about uninteresting things and much of the dialog is either slurred or mumbled (especially Afleck). The pompous narration adds to the misery. And what's with the repeated usage of the lens with blurry edges? Epic failure.",2,8,16,4 September 2009
Batman Begins," Bat-ting Average
","This is a dark, brooding film that explores the origin of Batman. Bale makes a good Batman, playing him as an earnest young crime-fighter. The cast is impressive, including such veterans as Caine, Freeman, Neeson, Wilkinson, and Oldman. Murphy makes a creepy villain while Mrs. Cruise is OK as the love interest. The problem is that the plot becomes too convoluted and the story is basically a rehash of previous Batman and Spiderman films. Ultimately, it amounts to nothing more that what it is: a silly comic book with lots of explosions and gadgets, including the ridiculous masks that change with emotions. The Batmobile looks more like a tank than a sleek sports car.",7,0,2,23 December 2007
Bridesmaids," Women Do Raunch
","The title characters squabble over which one is the best friend of the bride, thereby disrupting the festivities. The film sets out to prove that women can be as raunchy and disgusting as men, as if that's something to be proud of. While it is generally entertaining, much of it feels stale and the laughs are few and far between; perhaps women will find it more funny than men. The film's claim to fame is a scene where the women suffer from food poisoning, but the most amusing scene is the one where Wiig is trying to get the cop's attention by performing a series of illegal stunts in her car. For a comedy of this type, it goes on much too long.",7,2,4,26 December 2012
The Princess Bride," Silly Fun
","An evil prince wants to make the fair Buttercup his bride but her heart belongs to another. This fun adventure film features swashbuckling heroes, cowardly villains, a magician who sounds like a Jewish stand-up comic, and Rodents of Unsual Size. Wright is lovely if rather wooden in the title role. Elwes is appropriately dashing as the hero. The best performance is given by Patinkin as a vengeful man bent on finding the six-fingered man who killed his father. It's all a story told by Falk to grandson Savage and their scenes are quite amusing. It is a very simple and silly story that is enjoyable to watch but hardly the neo-classic some have made it out to be.",7,1,2,2 September 2007
Zulu," Overlong and Tedious
","This is an overlong and tedious war film with little plot. The first third of the film focuses on the British soldiers as they prepare for the Zulu attack, but these scenes are random and dull. The rest of the film is devoted to poorly executed battle scenes featuring fake combat and theatrical deaths. Although they outnumber the British 40 to one, the Zulu attack in small waves using spears and predictably get slaughtered by the gun-wielding British. Why would the Zulu utilize such an idiotic tactic after having demonstrated their military prowess in slaughtering 1200 British soldiers days before? Baker and Caine (in his film debut) are OK, but Hawkins chews the scenery as a preacher.",4,11,25,22 March 2011
Saving Private Ryan," The Neverending Story
","There is probably an exciting 90-minute movie lurking inside this never ending war epic about the search for a soldier. However, in an attempt to make a war movie to end all war movies, Spielberg did not leave anything on the cutting room floor, releasing the film with a running time of 17 hours or so. The much-admired battle scene depicting the Normandy landing is well done but what's the point of having it go on for 20 minutes, with gratuitous shots of severed limbs and guts literally spilling out? OK, war is hell, but many other films have made this point far more eloquently and succinctly. The acting is pretty good, although the characters are all war movie stereotypes.",7,1,3,9 April 2010
Revolutionary Road," What Lies Beneath
","In 1950s Connecticut, a seemingly happy young couple copes with personal problems. It's a beautifully realized film based on a 1961 novel by Richard Yates, although the screenplay is somewhat choppy. Mendes does an excellent job of evoking a period where life seemed to be simpler, but, as always, there were people who had to fight personal demons. Winslet and DiCaprio are terrific as the volatile couple, with the former seeking escape from her mundane existence while making life hell for the latter. Standouts in the supporting cast are Bates as a real estate agent and Shannon, funny and scary, as her mentally disturbed son. Newman provides a rather haunting score.",8,0,0,2 August 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," Landscape of Arabia
","The story of T. E. Lawrence as he fights for the Arab cause becomes a sprawling screen epic, magnificently photographed under the keen eye of Lean. The film made O'Toole a star and boasts an all-star. This is a fine film, but is extremely overrated. The plot, what little there is of it, is generally uninteresting and rambling, causing the middle part of the film to drag terribly. An hour or so could easily have been trimmed from the middle, thereby producing a tighter and more compelling story. The acting is uneven, with Guinness underacting and Quinn overacting as Arabs. Ultimately, though, the cinematography and score manage to compensate somewhat for the weaknesses in the script.",8,8,14,2 May 2006
City of God," City of Brilliance
","This saga about kids growing up in a violent and drug-infested neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro is fresh and vibrant from its droll opening scene to its riveting finale. It is brilliantly directed by Meirelles, who fuses an innovative story-telling technique with a fine script and terrific camera-work to create a memorable cinematic experience. The tension is palpable throughout, specially in a heart-wrenching scene where one child is prodded to shoot another as a gang initiation ritual. Although the subject matter is violence, the film never dwells on it, focusing instead on characters and circumstances. There is fine ensemble acting from a cast of non-stars.",9,3,6,18 May 2007
Cars," Flat Tires
","Mildly amusing tale of brash rookie race car who learns lessons in humility after being stranded in a small town. The animation is pretty good but the story is not up to the standard of Finding Nemo or Monsters, Inc. The script is predictable and the characters are all clichés. The cop car and the deputy are like Andy Taylor and Barney Fife. The jokes are rather stale. Just the concept of talking cars becomes tiresome after a while. There is one nice song ('Life is a Highway'); perhaps more music would have livened things up. Wilson does OK as the hero car and Newman brings the right gravitas to the voice of the wise old champion.",6,4,11,20 June 2006
JFK," Long-Winded Paranoia Theory
","A New Orleans DA becomes obsessed with the Kennedy assassination. Although presented like a documentary, this is nothing more than a propaganda film to advance Stone's paranoid conspiracy theory. It rambles on for an ungodly three and a half hours, and it's pretty much all talk. Most of the film seems like a prologue to the final half hour, where the conspiracy theory is finally presented. Basically, Stone believes that everybody conspired against JFK, including the White House, the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, and the Boys Club of America. Costner's character is meant to be sincere and honorable but comes across as pompous. The large all-star cast is impressive.",4,4,15,22 March 2011
Django Unchained," Ugly and Uninteresting
","A bounty hunter helps a slave rescue his wife. Tarantino has a sick obsession with violence. In films like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Inglorious Basterds,' the scripts are so interesting that one can overlook the blood-fest. Unfortunately, the script for this Western is so long and dreary that the repellent violence can't be ignored. The film actually gets off to a fairly engaging start, thanks to a gem of a performance from Waltz as dentist slash bounty hunter. Foxx is much less interesting as Django, a perpetually angry and arrogant slave. Things take a turn for the dreary when DiCaprio enters the picture as an evil slave owner. Soon thereafter the film runs out of steam but still rambles on for about an hour.",5,14,21,4 May 2013
The Lives of Others," The Dull Lives of Others
","This much-praised film tells the story of a celebrity couple in East Germany being spied on by the government. Koch and Gedeck are too subdued as the couple but Muhe gives a fine performance as the man who listens in on the couple's wire-tapped apartment. The problem is that the film moves very slowly and goes on too long. While the basic premise of the story is interesting, von Donnersmarck (great name!) does little to enliven the film or tap into the potential for suspense. A more talented director could have made this into a fine thriller. A couple of key plot elements are too contrived and some of the actions of characters are unexpected and left unexplained.",6,9,28,27 October 2007
Good Will Hunting," Pretentious and Manipulative
","A math genius works as a janitor at MIT, unable to overcome his difficult upbringing. The premise of this film is ludicrous. It really requires suspension of belief to buy that Damon, who never attended college, has become a genius by reading books. The pretentious and manipulative script by Damon and Afleck really reaches: not only can he do complex math problems, but he can hold his own with anyone when discussing politics, philosophy, economics, literature, and history. We are supposed to root for Damon, but he's such an arrogant jerk that one roots for someone to punch him out. Williams is fine as a psychologist, but it's a role he has played a number of times. Driver does well as Damon's needy girlfriend.",5,7,13,20 July 2013
Schindler's List," Bloated and Artsy
","Spielberg's List: (1) This is a SERIOUS film so shoot it in black and white (except for some gimmicky use of color) with such stark contrast between extremely bright artificial lighting and darkness that every scene screams ARTIST AT WORK. (2) To make it clear that the Nazis were evil, have a scene where they randomly shoot Jews. And another scene. And another and another... (3) To really drive home the point that this is an IMPORTANT film about a SOMBRE topic, fill it with enough repetitive scenes that it lasts nearly as long as WWII. (4) Rinse. (5) Repeat. Schindler was no doubt a great man, but his saintliness is way overdone. Neeson is fine, but Fiennes chews the scenery.",5,4,10,28 September 2010
Dog Day Afternoon," Intense but Overlong
","This is based on the true story of a bank robbery that went awry. It gets off to an intriguing start, jumping right into the robbery with great intensity and moments of humor, but it soon loses the momentum. It seems the filmmakers had a beginning and an end in mind, but didn't know how to fill the middle. The middle, featuring interactions with the robber's family and gay lover, is just soap opera, causing the film to drag. The film opens with about five minutes of random shots of NYC, serving no purpose other than to pad the running time when it's already overlong. Although Lumet tends to encourage overacting, Pacino is very good and the supporting cast is solid.",7,0,0,22 July 2010
Amadeus," Too Many Scenes
","This mostly fictional account of the relationship between Mozart and Salieri, a journeyman contemporary composer, is well filmed but has 'too many scenes,' to paraphrase Emperor Joseph. At three hours, it overstays its welcome with repetitive scenes. Was it necessary to spend 20 minutes on 'Don Giovanni'? The film's portrayal of Mozart as a vulgar buffoon is hard to reconcile with his genius for creating sublime music. Also, it gives the impression that Mozart only composed operas whereas the vast majority of his output is non-operatic. While Abraham is brilliant as Salieri, Hulce's idiot act becomes tiresome, and Berridge is badly miscast as Constanze. Jones is amusing.",7,3,8,7 January 2010
The Game," The Lame
","A fabulously rich investment manager signs up for a mysterious activity known as 'The Game,' which completely disrupts his life. It gets off to an intriguing start, as the anticipation builds for the game. Then the game begins and weird things start happening to Douglas that make no sense outside of sci-fi/fantasy realm. Yet, one watches with some interest expecting everything to be sorted out at some point, a point that never really comes. When the inevitable twist is revealed, one is left bewildered because it invalidates pretty much everything that has happened in the movie. This unbelievably stupid movie doesn't just call for suspension of disbelief, but also suspension of intelligence.",2,6,15,30 December 2011
The Man Who Would Be King," The Film that Would be Grand
","A couple of British blokes make their way to a primitive land near India in hopes of declaring themselves kings. A short story by Kipling is stretched a little thin in this overlong adventure. The first part of the film, before the journey to Kafiristan, is rather long and uninteresting. It is well acted by Connery and Caine as the duo seeking the crown, Jaffrey as their faithful friend in the foreign land, and Plummer as Kipling. Huston tries to make a grand adventure out of it, but there is not enough material to support such an ambitious effort. Some of the violence is gratuitous, and Kipling's imperialistic views can be hard to stomach.",7,1,11,16 March 2009
Ghostbusters," Do Not Call
","NYC is inundated with ghosts, leading to steady employment for a trio of ghost busters. This is supposed to be a comedy, but there's hardly anything here that's worth a chuckle. The script is meant to deliver both thrills and laughs, but fails miserably on both fronts. To paraphrase the only piece of dialog that is even mildly amusing here: this film is witless - it's true; it has no wit. Aykroyd and Ramis co-wrote the uninspired script and gave themselves boring straight-man roles. Murray is supposed to be the funny one and he tries to enliven things, but he's given little to work with. The special effects are cheesy and this lame film rambles on far too long.",5,8,16,28 September 2010
Gran Torino," Dirty Wally
","After his wife's death, a bitter old man wants to be left alone but is reluctantly drawn into the lives of his Hmong neighbors. Eastwood takes center stage here both in front of and behind the camera. Approaching his 80th birthday, he shows himself to be in his creative prime. It's not clear if Walt is really a bigot who undergoes a transformation or his gruff demeanor is just a shield he uses to guard his privacy. Perhaps the ambiguity is intentional. If this turns out to be Eastwood's final performance, it's quite a farewell. The scenes in the barber shop are hilarious, especially when Eastwood and Lynch teach Thao how real men talk. However, the finale is not believable.",8,0,7,12 September 2009
Shrek the Third," Shrek the Thud
","'Shrek' was a delightful film, featuring a fresh animation style and a lovable ogre. Unfortunately it made a lot of money; hence, the inevitable sequels. This one is less than inspired, with a tired script that seems to run out of ideas. The comedy is stale, with only a few chuckles here and there. The funniest bit is the frog king, whose death scene drags on forever. The all-star cast of voices is nice but cartoons are only as good as the story. There are too many characters crammed into a flimsy plot. As a result, it feels episodic and underwhelming. The worst part is knowing that Shrek IV is on the horizon.",6,0,0,3 June 2007
The Hurt Locker," Worst Best Picture Oscar Winner Ever
","American soldiers in Iraq defuse explosives while dodging sniper fire. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. And so it goes on and on and on for a mind-numbing 13 hours or so. The central character is an arrogant jerk; the other characters are stereotypes from central casting. There is no plot - just random encounters with insurgents. The most annoying aspect is the camera work. There's a scene in this film where the hero complains about the shaky camera work in an adult DVD he has purchased. Well, if he could step back he would notice that the film he's in is all shaky camera work and incessant zooming. It's nauseating. Somebody please take away Bigelow's camera. She is a clueless hack.",2,26,38,9 April 2010
Moulin Rouge!," All Around Ineptitude
","This musical is like a melding of a bad opera, an unfunny vaudeville show, and an annoying music video. The concept of constructing a story based on lyrics of popular songs has potential, but is undermined by inept direction and editing. Luhrmann is a clueless hack better suited to making MTV videos than a feature film. This is the perfect film for those suffering from attention deficit disorder. The editing is so frantic that few shots last more than a second. The incessant cutting and zooming is nauseating. The plot is clichéd and melodramatic, capped by a ludicrous finale. On the plus side, McGregor brings energy to his role and Kidman has never looked more beautiful.",2,6,11,12 February 2011
Slap Shot," Lackluster Sports Drama
","A minor league hockey team tries to salvage its losing season while dealing with the possibility of being sold. It is not clear what this film is meant to be. It's advertised as a comedy, but there's hardly anything funny here. There are endless scenes of home and road games that do little to propel the narrative. Newman is the player-coach, although he's too old to be playing and is not shown doing any coaching. The characters are undeveloped and uninteresting. This is inexplicably regarded as one of the best sports films. Director Hill is reunited with Newman, but the magic of 'Butch Cassidy' and 'The Sting' is missing here; perhaps if Robert Redford played Newman's teammate...",5,3,8,26 December 2012
Patton," Long-Winded
","Scott is terrific in the title role, creating a well-rounded portrait of the controversial general. He won a well-deserved Oscar, although he refused the award in protest. While the film is generally well done, the script is too long-winded, like a boring history lesson. Unless one is a military buff, the story (co-scripted by Coppola) isn't interesting enough to sustain a running time of nearly three hours. Tighter editing, particularly with regard to the early battle scenes, would have made for a more absorbing film. Schaffner tries to enliven things with flashy camera work, but it comes across as occasionally goofy instead. Goldsmith's score is well suited to the military theme.",7,1,4,5 September 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Silly Story Well Told
","Based on a story by Fitzgerald, a man is born old and gets younger as time passes. Given the silliness of the story, the filmmakers are to be commended for making an absorbing film out of it. Pitt is quite good, particularly in the early scenes as he plays an adolescent who looks like a little old man. Blanchett is OK as his love interest, but is not effective as a mumbling old lady. Benjamin's tale is told in flashbacks, as his love lies on her deathbed, but this framing mechanism seems too contrived. It is meticulously directed by Fincher. Although some superfluous scenes could easily have been deleted, it rarely drags despite the length of nearly three hours.",8,0,2,2 August 2009
Children of Men," Dreary and Depressing
","In 2027, when all women in the world are infertile, a British woman miraculously becomes pregnant and is escorted by a reluctant bureaucrat through a desolate world of warring groups to a safe haven. A fairly simple story is tediously dragged out. The film is uninteresting and depressing, a bad combination. The objectives of the militant group that Moore belongs to are never clearly explained. The characters are not fleshed out so the viewer has no rooting interest. Owen does OK as the hero. Moore's role is so small that she shouldn't have bothered. Caine, playing an old hippie, is lively but his character adds little to the story.",5,4,6,24 August 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Thousand Dollar Baby
","Eastwood and Freeman are good as the grumpy and wise, respectively, old men running a boxing gym but the film belongs to Swank, who is terrific as a determined female boxer. The boxing scenes are well staged. However, some of the characters are cartoonish and the plot is implausible. Maggie's family is portrayed as poor white trash without a single redeeming quality. It is hard to believe that Maggie, who is an angel, could have come from such a family. The plot device of Eastwood unable to connect with his daughter while building a relationship with Swank is too obvious. It explores some serious themes but treats them superficially. All in all, it is well-acted by the three stars but it certainly is not worthy of Best Picture or Best Director Oscar.",7,0,2,28 July 2006
Garden State," All Things Braff
","A struggling young actor returns to his home town in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral and connects with friends old and new. This is an offbeat comedy-drama that has its moments but doesn't really rise above mediocrity. Besides his starring role, Braff makes a promising debut as director and writer, although he does not excel in any of the three facets and the film comes across as somewhat of an ego trip. As an actor, he relies too much on his deadpan look for laughs. The script fails to sustain interest and shifts uneasily between comedy and drama. Portman is interesting if a bit too goofy as an unstable young woman he meets and falls in love with.",7,1,2,28 September 2010
Donnie Brasco," Another Gansgter Film
","An FBI agent goes undercover with the mob in New York City, endangering his life while collecting evidence to expose the mafia. This is another in a seemingly endless series of movies based on true stories about the mafia. And most of them star either Pacino or De Niro. In this case it is Pacino, doing his usual crime boss shtick. Despite the claims about being based on a true story, it is hard to believe that a fresh-faced cop like Depp would be able to fool so many hardened criminals. While well enough made, it really does have a sense of Deja Vu. Not only that, but as seems to be standard practice with these kinds of films, it goes on far too long.",7,0,1,17 November 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Entertaining but Clichéd
","A journalist is hired by a rich man to investigate the disappearance 40 years earlier of his niece. This Swedish film of the first entry in the phenomenally successful 'Millenium' trilogy of Larsson is entertaining in spite of uninspired casting, undeveloped characters, and a clichéd plot. Nyqvist is too bland of an actor to play the leading role while Rapace is just weird in the title role. The plot is contrived and far-fetched. Apparently, in Sweden everything is documented and readily accessible by the public, including expense reports of private citizens. Extraneous subplots (libel suit, Lisabeth's guardian) detract from the main story line and make the film overlong.",7,1,5,9 July 2010
World Trade Center," It Falls Flat
","One would think the subject is perfect for an emotional and exciting film, but this one falls completely flat. It is a mind-numbingly boring example of connect-the-dots filmmaking. There are endless shots of guys trapped under rubble followed by shots of concerned family members. Rinse. Repeat. Although based on real life people, the characters seem to be from central casting. The dialog is so dreadfully inane that one feels bad for the actors forced to deliver such pedestrian lines. Genius director Stone apparently wanted viewers to truly experience the pain and suffering of that fateful day: by having them sit through this wretched film. The victims and heroes of 9/11 deserve a better tribute.",3,0,2,28 September 2010
Black Snake Moan," Trashy and Dreary
","The town slut wakes up to find herself chained to the radiator of a man who sings the blues. It sounds like a great premise for a comedy, but this is a serious film. Ricci has little to do here except look slutty but she does so quite well. Jackson turns in a solid performance as the man who tries to cleanse her of her sins. It's hard, however, to get past the ridiculousness of the script. Another problem is that the film goes on too long. Once the premise has been established, the film has nowhere to go really, and it begins to drag. The promos for the film try to play up the angle of a luscious, young white woman chained by a black man, but it fails to deliver even as a trashy guilty pleasure.",4,4,12,26 December 2012
Black Hawk Down," Tedious and Rambling
","This war movie recounts U.S. military action in Somalia in 1993. It is action-packed, which is not surprising given Scott's reputation as an action director. In fact, there is little here beyond battle scenes. There is no plot other than American forces taking on the forces of the Somali dictator. As there is no drama, there's nothing to hold the interest of any viewers who are not military buffs. The battle scenes become increasingly tedious, and the film rambles on for nearly two and half hours. The early scenes focus on the strategy of the Americans, but there's little that is compelling and the characters are strictly out of central casting, wasting a good cast.",2,2,7,30 December 2011
Big Fish," A Good Catch
","A dying man reflects on his life and all the great adventures he has experienced - or is he telling tall tales? Although somewhat disjointed and not completely satisfying, this unique film is quite charming. Finney is the old man and McGregor plays him in his younger days as a dashing hero. Both turn in capable performances, helped by a good supporting cast that includes a host of familiar faces, including Crudup as Finney's son, Lange as his wife, and DeVito as a circus performer. It's funny to see Devito tower over the even more diminutive Deep Roy. This is perhaps Burton's best film, as he perfectly captures the whimsy and playfulness of the story.",8,0,1,3 April 2009
The Insider," Fascinating Drama
","A former employee of a tobacco company wants to blow the whistle on the illegal practices of Big Tobacco but is faced with legal issues as well as threats to his family. This is a fascinating recreation of the events leading up to the broadcast of a '60 Minutes' interview with whistle blower Jeffrey Wigand. There are excellent performances from Crowe as Wigand, Pacino as a '60 Minutes' producer, and Plummer as Mike Wallace. Despite the long running time, the tension builds continually and the film never drags, thanks to the expert screenplay. The film succeeds in spite of Mann, the hack director who tries to always draw attention to himself with his distracting camera work.",8,2,2,9 July 2010
The Dark Knight," Dark and Dreary
","Although an average film, 'Batman Begins' had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolan's dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make 'Batman Ends.'",4,29,61,3 May 2009
Into the Wild," Clichés Abound
","This film recounts the true story of Chris McCandless, a young man who decided to drop out of society and go live in the wilds of Alaska. Penn should stick to his day job. He employs every cinematic cliché known to man in an attempt to romanticize the story and portray the McCandless as a hero. Apparently McCandless was so charming that he instantly bonded with everyone he met on his journey, and everyone he met was a hippie. However, based on the evidence presented here, the guy was nothing more than a pretentious, self-absorbed, and irresponsible jerk who put his family through hell. Slow motion is utilized in every other scene, effectively doubling the length of the film.",3,3,5,28 September 2010
Annie Hall," Allen's first masterpiece
","Woody's first mature film after the early funny ones breaks new ground with its interesting technique of having characters talk to earlier versions of themselves that they visit in flashbacks. He also has the characters voice their inner thoughts to funny effects. It was rightfully acclaimed at the time of its release. In retrospect, this film is still wonderful but has lost some of its edge because the remarkably prolific Allen has since made a number of films that are equally good and at least one, 'Manhattan,' that is better. There are a number great lines but the most famous line from this movie will always be the one uttered by Keaton in the title role: 'La-di-da.'",8,0,1,11 August 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Snail Odyssey
","Kubrick has made some great films. He also made this drivel - a space film that moves at a snail's pace and has no plot or meaning. The first third of the film, including the never-ending opening sequence with monkeys, is mind-numbingly boring. The last third, a psychedelic trip across space and time, is fascinating - if one's on drugs. Only the middle part, featuring that funny guy HAL 9000, is somewhat interesting. To the masses who adore this indulgent nonsense about monoliths and star babies, it supposedly reveals great truths about life, the universe, and everything. The real truth is that the emperor is not wearing any clothes.",4,18,38,2 June 2009
Blood Diamond," This Diamond Doesn't Shine
","Against the backdrop of the civil war in Sierra Leone, a soldier of fortune and a fisherman try to retrieve a rare diamond that the latter has buried. The ravages of war are effectively conveyed but it takes a while for a narrative to emerge from all that chaos. And the narrative is less than compelling due to a weak script and undeveloped characters. Although they find time to espouse philosophy in breaks between frequent gun battles, the characters remain one-dimensional. The film is meant to be emotionally gripping but is tedious instead. DiCaprio sports a goofy accent. Connelly proves the camera is mightier than the sword. Hounsou looks intense. Zwich favors melodramatics.",5,2,5,4 September 2009
The Graduate," A Cultural Milestone
","After graduating from college, a young man has an affair with an older woman before falling in love with her daughter. This film about alienation and great expectations is a perfect mix of comedy and drama, a cultural milestone. Nichols's direction is so marvelously innovative in terms of camera work and editing that it still feels fresh decades after its release. An integral component of the success of this film is the superb soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel, full of memorable tunes. Hoffman is excellent in his star-making turn, an impeccable comic performance. In Mrs. Robinson, Bancroft creates a figure who is sexy, vulnerable, and tragic. The seduction scenes are hilarious.",10,0,0,10 December 2009
Singin' in the Rain," Simply the Best
","The question isn't whether this is the best musical ever, but whether it is the best film ever. Unlike most musicals, this one has a terrific story about Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies. Kelly, Reynolds, and O'Connor have great chemistry. Mitchell is marvelous as the studio head while Hagen's performance is a comic gem. Kelly and Donen are in peak form behind the camera. The musical highlights include 'Make 'Em Laugh,' 'Good Morning,' 'All I Do is Dream of You,' and 'Moses.' However, nothing ever put on celluloid can touch the jubilant glory of Kelly's romp in the rain to the title song. It is the most magical moment in the history of cinema. What a glorious feeling!",10,0,1,4 September 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternal Boredom of the Dreary Mind
","After the relationship between a couple sours, they don't just cut their losses and move on, letting time heal their wounds. No, the woman undergoes a novel procedure that selectively erases her memory of him. Not to be outdone, he decides to have the same procedure himself to purge her from his brain but then starts to have second thoughts during the procedure. After an intriguing start, the convoluted plot turns into a dreary mess, much like writer Kaufman's 'Adaptation.' It flashes forward and backward in time and veers from reality to dreams to subconscious thought to some combination thereof. The end result of all this brilliant movie-making is nausea for the viewer. It wastes a decent cast.",6,4,8,12 May 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," Fine Finale for Leone
","Epic story about the rise and fall of four gangsters over the course of over forty years. The film has a somewhat complex structure as it switches back and forth between three eras (1920's, 30's, 60's). Despite its extreme length, it manages to sustain interest thanks to Leone's masterful direction and excellent period detail, reminiscent of The Godfather Part II. The film is at its best in showing the early years in New York City, beautifully evoking a bygone era. The child actors, including a young Jennifer Connelly, are very good. The script leaves some loose ends (who the men are chasing DeNiro at the beginning is never explained, the Pesci character abruptly disappears) but is still satisfying. Morricone provides another fine score. A fitting swan song for the stylish Leone.",8,0,3,30 April 2006
Taken," Ridiculous
","After his daughter is kidnapped, a CIA agent goes after the bad guys with a vengeance. It is interesting that writer Bresson receives before the title screen credit because the script here is atrocious, nearly as bad as his 'La Femme Nikita.' It starts off as merely sub-par in the expository scenes, where the cardboard characters are introduced, including a 17- year-old daughter who looks about 25 and behaves like 12. Then the kidnapping occurs and the film becomes increasingly ridiculous. Neeson single-handedly takes out about seven hundred bad guys in Paris while barely getting a scratch on himself. And he does this with a straight face. The guy makes James Bond look like a wimp.",3,2,6,26 December 2012
This Is Spinal Tap," This is Hilarious
","This is an inspired rockumentary or mockumentary about legendary British heavy metal band Spinal Tap trying to make a comeback on an American tour. It is such an audacious directorial debut for Reiner, who also plays a filmmaker documenting the comeback tour, that he has yet to make a better film. It's brimming with hilarious moments (interviews, song lyrics, stage performances, internal squabbles). What really makes it work is that McKean, Guest, and Shearer look totally believable as band members. Highlights include the rant about miniature sandwiches, the Stonehenge fiasco, the band unable to find the stage in Cleveland, and the amp that goes to 11.",8,1,5,9 April 2010
Avatar," I See Blue People
","In the future, a paraplegic marine's avatar (a goofy blue-skinned cartoon-like incarnation of himself that he controls while sleeping) is sent on a mission to mingle with the natives of a distant planet. The pictures are pretty but the story is a lame rehash of a theme that has been done much better before. The movie becomes increasingly tedious as it lumbers along for nearly three hours. Cameron is not so much interested in making a compelling movie as in flaunting his prowess with special effects. Weaver's presence only serves to remind one of how good a sci-fi film can be ('Alien'). This nonsensical movie plays out like a dull computer game.",3,5,8,4 July 2010
Chariots of Fire," Plodding Drama
","This Oscar winner recounts the true story of two British runners who competed in the Paris Olympics of 1924. It opens and closes with a marvelous sequence with men running on the beach in slow motion to the now-familiar Vangelis theme. What comes in between, however, is a plodding drama that unfolds at a pace that is much too leisurely. There are too many heavy-handed conversations about God and country. The two main characters, an angry Jew and a Bible-thumping Christian, are so self-righteous that one doesn't give a damn what happens to them. The running scenes are exciting but slow-motion is overused. Sadly, Charleson and Davis both died young from AIDS.",6,1,7,7 August 2011
Drag Me to Hell," Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned
","After being rejected for a loan, an old gypsy woman puts a curse on the loan officer, making her life miserable. This horror film creates a very eerie atmosphere, with mysterious forces in action in the dark. However, it's more comical than scary and that may be by design. It seems Raimi is having fun with this and not taking any of it too seriously. Some scenes involving slimy critters and bodily fluids go too far however. Lohman does fine as the loan officer who picks the wrong customer to tick off. Long plays her boyfriend and it's hard to see him as anyone other than the Mac guy. It's all quite silly but one could do worse.",6,0,2,28 September 2010
The Artist," Not Talking' in the Rain
","As Hollywood makes the transition from silent films to talkies in 1927, a silent star is not able to adapt. Not only does this film cover the same theme as 'Singin' in the Rain,' but Dujardin looks like Gene Kelly. While nicely crafted and well acted, much of the praise that the film has garnered is due to the gimmick that it looks like a silent film. There's a reason silent films have not been made since talkies emerged. Talking adds an important dimension to films. Without this dimension, this simple film runs out of steam half-way through. Dujardin is expressive, but his character is too aloof and self-centered to elicit much sympathy. Bejo is charming. The dog is adorable.",7,1,4,26 December 2012
There's Something About Mary," Lame Comedy
","Years after a disastrous date with the high school beauty queen, a nerd hires a private detective to find her. The film has some amusing moments (Stiller wrestling a little dog, the famous hair gel scene), but the pacing is too lethargic for a comedy and it goes on much too long. The humor is sophomoric, which is fine if the gags are funny but for the most part they are not. Diaz displays a fine flair for comedy. This role served as a blueprint for Stiller's career while the film did so for the Farrelly Brothers (who'll never be confused for the Coen Brothers). Dillon seems to be having fun. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the audience.",6,4,9,9 April 2010
Mission: Impossible," Impossibly Stupid
","Super agents look tense and blow up stuff. It's a good thing Peter Graves was alive when this came out, or he would have been turning over in his grave at the treatment of his character from the beloved TV show. The script is by turns confusing and dull. An early action sequence where the team tries to do something to somebody at a party at a mansion is very clumsily executed by De Palma. A later sequence at the CIA headquarters comes off a little better but is quite far-fetched. The most ludicrous, however, is the final action sequence aboard a moving train. The cast is stellar, but only Redgrave turns in a noteworthy performance.",3,0,2,27 December 2012
Super 8," Super Bad
","A group of stereotypical teenagers accidentally discovers something really bad. Although directed by Abrams, it has all the earmarks of a Spielberg film, as it is focused on kids in peril and borrows bits and pieces from the likes of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' 'The Goonies,' and 'E.T.' Abrams shows that he can match Spielberg when it comes to mind-numbingly stupid movies. The film starts off as merely bad but ends up being utterly ridiculous. Apparently the alien here is not of the friendly variety from 'Close Encounters' and 'E.T.,' as this one sucks electricity out of the town, kills people, causes dogs to go bonkers, and causes stuff to explode.",1,2,5,27 December 2012
Life Is Beautiful," Touching Comedy-Drama
","During WWII, a Jewish couple and its young son are sent to a concentration camp. Benigni won an Oscar for his wonderful portrayal of an eternal optimist. The film effectively blends humor with the atrocities of war, eventually proving to be a touching story. It is not necessarily believable but the sheer force of Benigni's personality is enough to allow one to go along for the ride. Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife, plays his wife while little Cantarini does well as the five-year old son who Benigni tries to shield from the horrors of the concentration camp. Buchholz, best remembered as an impetuous young member of 'The Magnificent Seven,' has one of his final roles here as an eccentric German.",8,1,2,8 June 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Crime and Punishment
","Kubrick's adaptation of the Burgess novel is a feast for the eyes and the ears. McDowell is excellent as a young criminal in a futuristic England who, along with his 'droogs,' engages in senseless acts of ultra-violence. Kubrick infuses the film with spectacular visuals that seem fresh and cutting-edge even after four decades. Basically, this is a black comedy about crime, punishment, and free will, and there are many hilarious moments. In a fine cast, Magee and Bates stand out. The great soundtrack features Beethoven's glorious Ninth Symphony, Rossini's 'The Thieving Magpie,' Purcell's 'Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary' (peculiarly uncredited), and 'Singin' in the Rain.'",9,0,1,30 December 2011
Where Eagles Dare," Utterly Implausible
","During WWII, an Allied force infiltrates a German castle in the Bavarian alps. The plot is contrived and the action is mindless. It is so utterly implausible that it makes James Bond films seem realistic. It is laughable how easily the Allied force infiltrates the German stronghold - not even their accents give them away, although this issue is circumvented by having all characters speak English in their own accents. The good guys kill hundreds of Nazis and blow up buildings and bridges with their unlimited supply of explosives. The Nazis, on the other hand, are so inept that they don't get a scratch on Burton's gang, and it takes them 15 minutes to break down a locked door.",5,18,33,30 December 2011
The Fly," Gross
","In this remake of the 1958 film, a scientist develops a machine to transport matter via disintegration and reintegration, but a fly in the ointment leads to tragedy. It gets off to an intriguing start, helped by good performances by Goldblum and Davis. It then becomes more and more ludicrous and all logic is tossed aside, even if one accepts the basic premise of the story. While the horror was suggestive in the original film, here everything is explicit and it's not even horror. Cronenberg seems far less interested in horror than in grossing out the audience. From hideous makeup to oozing body fluids, the film wallows in gratuitous grossness.",6,1,4,28 September 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Pretentious and Ponderous Pasolini
","Fascists kidnap a group of teenagers and put them through months of torture. This is supposed to make some point about fascism being bad (who knew?) but is little more than a cheap exploitation film. Although his supporters see the work of a genius, Pasolini blurs the boundary between art and pornography. He seems to be particularly obsessed with bodily functions that are best kept behind closed bathroom doors. It is not clear what the director's intentions are, but he certainly fails to convey any coherent message. The only thing that's clear is that this is the work of a sick mind. It does not even work as a guilty pleasure of depravity, as much of it is just tedious and pretentious.",2,3,11,31 December 2008
Limitless," Listless
","A writer suffering from a severe case of writer's block finds a pill that essentially turns him into Superman. Not only does the pill boost his brain power and stamina, it also makes him an expert on anything he has read or seen since birth. It's a silly premise that has the potential for a good comedy, but doesn't really work as drama. Given that Cooper proceeds to take the pills despite the dangerous side effects, the story could have worked along the theme of a Faustian bargain. However, the film is not up to the challenge. The filmmakers are unsure of where to go, and the story just rambles rather aimlessly, culminating in an unsatisfying ending.",5,0,1,20 January 2013
The Red Violin," Segmented Symphony
","The history of a famous violin, as it changes hands over centuries, provides the framework for this episodic film. The cinematography, particularly in the period episodes, is exquisite, and the score is nice. However, the segmented structure makes it difficult to become involved with the story and the characters. The dialog in the Oxford segment is laughably bad. The Chinese segment belongs in another movie. The Montreal segment, which the story centers around, is repetitious and uninteresting. Other than the violin, there is nothing compelling holding the segments of the film together, and it tends to drag due to its excessive length.",4,3,5,3 May 2009
Some Like It Hot," Almost Perfect
","Wilder directs this classic comedy about musicians trying to escape from the mob with great verve and elicits memorable performances. It features the definitive dumb blonde performance by Monroe as Sugar Kane. Curtis does a good impression of Cary Grant, with whom he worked in 'Operation Petticoat' the same year. Lemmon has one of his best roles as a woman in love. Brown is delightful as the man who lusts after Lemmon and gets to utter the film's famous closing line. The only quibbles are that the characters are cartoony and the violence is somewhat jarring for a comedy. As great as this is, Wilder would follow it up with another great comedy, 'The Apartment.'",9,3,6,23 November 2007
Inside Man," Muddled Heist Drama
",New York police negotiates with bank robbers who have take hostages. The plot is basically a rehash of other heist films except that this one is rather muddled. It clumsily moves back and forth in time in an attempt to be edgy but winds up being confusing instead. There are enough plot holes to drive a Brink's truck through. There is very little suspense and the ending is quite underwhelming. The plot thread involving Plummer is predictable and nonsensical. Washington does his usual cool guy schtick; his reaction to the hostage situation is much too nonchalant. Owen isn't given much to do. Foster is too arrogant and it's not clear who she is and how she holds so much power.,6,1,3,28 September 2010
Hoosiers," OK Hoop Drama
","A shy but talented young man leads his small town high school basketball team to the state championship. The small town atmosphere is nicely evoked in this film, which was inspired by the true story of the Milan High School's 1954 state title in Indiana. The game action is well simulated, but it seems too calculated and predictable to create true excitement. Hackman is terrific as usual as the coach who's been given a second chance to revive his career. Hershey is also effective as a teacher that Hackman initially clashes with. Hopper has a showy role as a former star player who's now a drunk, but is given a chance by Hackman to redeem himself.",7,0,0,26 December 2012
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Slick but Unpleasant
","This slick film details the lives of a bunch of blokes in the British underworld as they fight over drug money. The Cockney accents of most of the characters are so thick that anyone outside Britain would have to have the subtitles turned on to understand what is going on. There are too many characters and not a single one of them is likable. It's difficult to keep track of the three gangs, who all seem to have similar looking young men. The plot is interesting though somewhat convoluted. Ritchie directs with a lot of energy but his cinematic tricks (freeze-frames and voice-overs) are distracting. Songs are overused on the soundtrack.",6,10,19,28 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," This Goblet is Overflowing
","The good news is that it is better than the previous installment (Prisoner of Azkaban). The bad news is that it's not as good as the first two, which had a sense of freshness and wonder about them. It does a nice job of evoking the Hogwarts environment but is undone by too many characters, too much plot, and too much special effects. To fully appreciate this, one must have read not only the book it's based on but the previous books as well. The Rowling books manage to be ponderous and silly while taking themselves too seriously; these qualities, unfortunately, have been faithfully transferred to the screen.",6,1,2,29 July 2007
Three Colors: Blue," Boo
","A woman tries to cope with the death of her husband, a famous composer, and child in a car accident. This is the first of a trilogy of films about colors by Kieslowski, and it is about as pretentious as one would expect with such a contrived premise. OK, we get it that grieving equates with blue, but the director raises the indulgence quotient to extreme levels with weird sound and visual effects. Sporadically, the screen goes dark - it's not clear if this is symbolic of the widow's mental state or just a case of sloppy editing. Binoche is a good actress but she isn't given much to work with here. The film just rambles on pointlessly, with one tedious scene after another.",2,23,42,9 April 2010
The Untouchables," De Palma's Masterpiece
","De Palma has always been a stylist, but many of his films have become examples of style over substance due to weak scripts. Here he has the luxury of working with a marvelous script by Mamet, one that is refreshingly simple and direct in pitting the good guys against the bad guys. De Palma's dynamic direction is marked by a fluid camera, aided by evocative sets, crisp cinematography, and another great score by Morricone. Costner is well cast as Ness, but is overshadowed by Connery as a seasoned cop and De Niro as Capone. The highlight of the film is the sequence at the train station that pays homage to the Oddessa steps scene of Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin.'",9,0,0,2 August 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Stars Shine, Script Doesn't
","Assassins have been married for years without knowing about each other's secret profession, but things get complicated when they become each other's targets. The story is silly but the potential is there for a delicious black comedy. Unfortunately, the film is let down by a mediocre script that is more concerned with explosions than characters and wit. It gets off to an interesting start, but becomes increasingly preposterous and eventually turns into a routine action film with mindless shootouts and car chases. Pitt and Jolie have great chemistry as the couple with a boring marriage, a pairing that ignited sparks off-screen for the stars.",6,0,3,26 December 2012
The Departed," Scorsese's Best
","This absorbing crime drama set in Boston focuses on the dynamics of a situation where a mob informant joins the police force and an undercover cop infiltrates the mob. Perhaps the best film of Scorsese's distinguished career, it ratchets up the tension from the beginning and doesn't let up for a moment despite its long running time. Although violent, Scorsese does not dwell on the violence as he does in some of his earlier films. The all-star cast is in top form. DiCaprio is gritty as the earnest undercover cop, Damon is appropriately slimy as the informant, and Nicholson is in his element as the mob boss. Sheen, Wahlberg, and Baldwin provide good support.",9,2,6,15 December 2007
Die Hard," Stupid but Fun
","A New York cop takes on a group on terrorists holding hostages in a Los Angelos office building. In a role that catapulted him into a box office star, Willis is terrific as the wise-cracking cop. He is matched by Rickman, marvelous in his film debut as the sneering bad guy. Bedelia is given little to do. VelJohnson is likable as a cop, although his banter with Willis is rather corny. It gets off to a great start and could have been a great film. However, some stupid characters are introduced and the plot becomes increasingly silly as it goes along. McTiernan shows a flair for action, keeping things moving at a frenetic pace.",8,1,2,4 September 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Atmospheric Thriller
","A young couple moves into a New York City apartment, where strange things start happening. Making his first American film, Polanski expertly creates a suspenseful atmosphere where tension builds slowly but surely in this influential supernatural thriller, helped by a haunting score. As with his earlier 'Repulsion,' the director conveys horror not so much by what is shown as what is suggested. As a young woman undergoing a difficult pregnancy, to put it mildly, Farrow is terrific in a star-making turn. Cassavetes may be miscast as her husband, but Gordon and Blackmer are quite effective as nosy neighbors. The cast features such familiar faces as Bellamy, Cook, Henry, and Grodin.",8,1,2,8 June 2013
When Harry Met Sally...," Woody Lite
","The relationship between the title characters is explored over the course of a dozen years. This treads the same ground that Woody Allen's romantic comedies have been exploring for decades except that this feels like one of his lesser efforts because Reiner is not in the same league as Allen. This is an uninspired, by-the-numbers exercise that is fondly remembered by audiences primarily for its single funny scene - the fake orgasm by Ryan at a deli. Unfortunately, everything else about this witless comedy also seems fake, including the emotions and the relationships. The intermittent interviews with the couples is meant to be touching, but comes across as pathetically contrived.",5,8,17,9 April 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," Zero is Right
","This is what happens when you encourage bad effort. The team of Bigelow and Boal was showered with praise for the horrible 'The Hurt Locker.' Now the inept team is back with an effort that's equally bad if not worse. Told in a documentary style, this is basically the story of investigative journalism, which can be riveting if done right, as in 'All the President's Men.' Boal's script, however, is so excruciatingly boring that this one is painful to sit through. Bigelow does not help matters with her drab direction. The film is nothing more than a series of meetings, interviews, and torture scenes. Even the finale, where the force makes its way through Bin Laden's compound, fails to be compelling.",1,28,56,30 March 2013
There Will Be Blood," Epic Mediocrity
","This leisurely-paced drama recounts the life and times of a ruthless oil tycoon. There are fine performances from Day-Lewis (seemingly doing a John Huston impression) and Dano, but there is little to the plot to hold one's interest for nearly three hours. Anderson is the emperor with no clothes. As with 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia,' he makes an overlong film out of mediocre material, believing that audiences will equate great length with great film (and apparently the masses have done just that). Like 'Magnolia,' this too meanders aimlessly and has a ridiculous ending. The dissonant score is interesting if sometimes grating, and doesn't seem to be in sync with the visuals.",6,3,7,3 August 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," This bird don't sing
","This much-praised movie is about a lawyer and his children living in a racially divisive South in the 1930s. Although the central theme concerns the lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman, much of the film is devoted to the exploits of the children as they play games and make trouble. Therein lies the problem. Watching the children at play is only mildly interesting. The focus shifts to the rape trial for a while and then its back to the children and a weird neighbor (Duvall), who seems to be from another movie. The film is poorly constructed, lacking focus. Peck is good as Finch, who is portrayed as a decent fellow but certainly not the greatest hero in American cinema as AFI would have us believe. Considering its reputation, a very disappointing film.",6,21,36,12 May 2006
A Hard Day's Night," A Day in the Life
","Coinciding with the release of their third album, this film debut of the Beatles is an irreverent look at a typical day in the life of the quartet from Liverpool. There isn't much of a plot - just a series of vignettes that appear spontaneous and unscripted. Lester, making only his second feature film, uses a hand-held camera much of the time, conveying a sense of urgency. It still feels fresh four decades later and is a precursor to the music videos that became popular two decades later. John, Paul, George, and Ringo show themselves to be natural actors. Musical highlights include 'All My Loving,' 'Can't Buy Me Love,' 'And I Love Her,' 'She Loves You,' and of course the title song.",8,2,2,7 January 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Crazy is Funny
","The Kesey novel about the inmates of an insane asylum is turned into this Oscar-fest by director Forman. Nicholson comes alive as the convict who convinces authorities he is crazy rather than a criminal and then creates havoc at the asylum. Fletcher is perfect as the strict, unemotional, and rather sadistic nurse that Nicholson clashes with. The other inmates are excellently played by a cast that includes then unknowns like De Vito and Lloyd. Dourif is impressive in his film debut. The first half of the film is the best, particularly the therapy sessions that are both funny and poignant. Later, it turns serious and loses some its momentum.",8,0,1,5 December 2009
Downfall," Repetitious History
","This is a documentary-like account of the final days of the Third Reich, with Hitler alternating between delusions of power and acknowledgment of defeat as the Russian Red Army closes in on Berlin. It is very well filmed, but offers no new historical perspective except perhaps to present Hitler as something more than a one-dimensional monster. Its biggest flaw is its sense of repetitiveness. There are countless scenes of Hitler meeting with his generals and discussing flawed tactics. Then the suicide scenes start and these go on forever. Since there is hardly any plot and certainly no suspense, the extreme length of the film becomes tiresome after a while.",6,1,10,20 July 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Horrifically Inept
","Bram Stoker must be turning over in his grave. This horrifically inept adaptation of the famous novel earns the distinction of being the worst movie ever made by an Oscar-winning director. It is hard to believe that the man who gave us 'The Godfather' is responsible for this travesty. Although the title suggests a faithfulness to the novel, the film takes liberties and none for the better. Although the cinematography is beautiful and there is a fine score, the plot is incoherent and quite tedious. Coppola adds gratuitous violence and gross scenes to make it look edgy, but fails miserably. Both Reeves and Ryder look out of place in this setting.",1,17,31,20 October 2008
American Gangster," Overdone
","This film looks at the rise of a black gangster in NYC in the early 1970s. The plot has similarities to 'The Godfather,' but this film is a far cry from that classic. Although he sports a glum look to convey toughness and ruthlessness, Washington is miscast as the drug lord, a truly despicable character that is at odds with the actor's persona. Crowe fares better as an honest cop. Scott is certainly a competent director but the film could have used a good editor. While the plot is rather simplistic (was it really this easy for Frank Lucas to become a drug lord?), it is drawn out to epic length with repetitive scenes that add little to the narrative.",6,1,3,4 September 2009
The Mission," Mission: Impossibly Boring
","The highlights of this film about Jesuit priests in the South American jungles are beautiful cinematography and an intriguing score. There are a lot more lowlights. De Niro goes from a slave trader and killer to a noble hero but the transformation is not believable because the character has no depth. He is redeemed, he cries, he laughs, he gets a hug from Irons, but we have no idea what's going on inside. His line 'Are you laughing at me?' is almost a parody of his 'Are you talking to me?' from 'Taxi Driver.' Joffe has no feel for pace as he lets the camera linger on mundane events, making the film seem about seven hours long. Even the big finale is a letdown, with poorly staged battle scenes.",5,11,21,25 September 2006
The Reader," Solid Drama
","Years after a young man ends an affair with an older woman in post-WW2 Germany, she is accused of war crimes. The first third of the film, which focuses on the affair, goes on a bit too long and runs out of steam, but things become interesting thereafter as we eventually learn the fate of the woman. Winslet is quite good in her Oscar-winning role, effectively conveying the conflicting emotions of her tragic character. She is ably supported by Kross and Fiennes, playing her lover as an eager young man and a reserved older man, respectively. Daldry's direction is marked by visual elegance and dramatic moments that are moving but not overly sentimental, helped by a fine score by Muhly.",8,0,1,2 June 2009
Jaws," Bruce Almighty
","This blockbuster about a shark feasting on crowds at a summer resort launched Spielberg's career into the stratosphere. The success of this film can be attributed to the chemistry among the three stars: Scheider as the police chief, Shaw as the shark hunter, and Dreyfuss as a marine scientist. Shaw, who met with an untimely death three years later, is particularly memorable as the cantankerous Quint. Of course they are just supporting actors to the real star: Bruce the shark. Spielberg does a masterful job of generating suspense and terror. Williams adds to the tension with the throbbing theme music that is quite effective if unoriginal (he lifted it from Dvorak's Ninth Symphony).",8,7,14,3 May 2009
The Wrestler," Ugly
","A washed-up pro wrestler tries to hang on to his fading glory days while struggling with life outside the ring. The first third of this ugly movie wallows in the atrocities of wrestling, with revolting scenes of flesh wounds and bloodletting. It gets better as the focus shifts out of the ring, but clichés abound. Rourke is surprisingly good, providing a sympathetic portrait of a loser. Tomei is also good as an aging stripper. Aronofsky is so obsessed with the back of Rourke's head that about a quarter of the film is devoted to a hand-held camera following Rourke from behind as he walks around. This is the genius director's idea of riveting film-making.",5,3,5,17 July 2010
Shooter," Video Game Thriller
","A sniper hired to protect the president instead gets framed for the assassination attempt and must go on the lam. The film moves at a rapid pace and the action is non-stop and generally entertaining. Wahlberg is a capable action star and Pena is likable as an FBI agent. Unfortunately, much of the action is so mindlessly stupid that it's hard to become invested in the plot. Wahlberg is like a video game superhero who gets out of any jam, even when he is outnumbered hundred to one. James Bond has nothing on this guy. The plot has all the clichés one associates with political thrillers, including government conspiracies and crooked politicians.",6,0,0,28 September 2010
Inception," Insipid
","Nolan has made some of the dreariest films in recent memory, but this incomprehensible nonsense takes the cake. While keeping a straight face, actors deliver lines such as 'dreams within dreams is too unstable' and 'if we get killed we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn into scrambled egg.' DiCaprio and company supply the ham. This movie tells us that ten hours of real time is equivalent to one week of dream time. That explains why this nightmare of a movie feels like it goes on for two days despite the running time of two and a half hours. And if one falls asleep while watching, the only way to resume one's normal life is to limbo under a totem pole.",1,41,77,12 February 2011
WALL·E," Worst-E
","Pixar has turned out some fine animation films, including such charming offerings as 'Finding Nemo' and 'Ratatouille.' This boy-robot meets girl-robot film is one of the company's worst. It is a bleak, boring story of a robot left behind to cleanup the Earth after it has been abandoned by humans. The title character is supposed to be cute and endearing, but the film is simply too uninteresting for one to care. The dialog-free first third of the film drags. When the action moves to the spaceship holding the humans it becomes mildly amusing, thanks to the antics of the captain, but it's not enough to save this from being a dud.",2,3,15,16 March 2009
The Terminal," Terminally Stupid
","A preposterous film about a foreigner stuck at an airport for months because circumstances make him a man without a country. It becomes more absurd as it goes along. He can barely speak a line of English in the beginning. In a matter of days he's mastered the language by watching TV. Then uber babe flight attendant Zeta-Jones falls for this fat, homeless slob. He then stays up all night and finds the tools and materials to build a monument of love for her in the form of a huge fountain. To top it all off is the unbelievably lame ending when we finally learn what he's been carrying around in the stupid coffee can the whole time. The characters are stereotypes and the situations are contrived. It is mildly entertaining but a big disappointment.",6,2,5,26 May 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Voter Fraud!
","This movie provides positive proof that the IMDb website has security holes. Somehow the family members of the filmmakers hacked the system to grossly inflate the votes for this movie. How else to explain the No. 2 ranking of a film that probably does not belong in the Top 2000? It is an entertaining prison yarn but there are at least twenty prison movies that are superior to this and the filmmakers had the good sense to borrow from these (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, etc.). In fact, the same director's The Green Mile, which is also based on a Stephen King story and set in a prison, is a better film. On the acting front, Robbins and Freeman are always watchable.",7,2,6,7 May 2006
Platoon," Repetitious and Uncompelling
","In his breakthrough film, Stone relates the travails of a platoon of soldiers in Vietnam. The point Stone wants to make is that war is brutal. And he keeps making that point over and over again for two hours. The film is nothing more than a series of battle scenes, with interludes for drugs and booze. The battles are less than compelling because they are against a faceless enemy. Almost every line of the dialog includes a popular four-letter word and its adjective form. Furthermore, everybody spews clichés. On the plus side, some of the cinematography is quite beautiful and Barber's 'Adagio for Strings' is used effectively. The acting is pretty good, especially Dafoe.",6,2,5,27 October 2008
Halloween," No Treat
","An unstable boy who killed his sister on Halloween grows up into an unstable superhuman who escapes from an asylum so he can resume his hobby of killing people on Halloween. How he turned into a superhuman (he simply shakes off stabs and gunshots) while in captivity is never explained. This cliché-ridden thriller is praised (blamed) for spawning the slasher films of the 1980s - a dubious distinction. Of course the teens all behave stupidly, making themselves vulnerable to the killer. Carpenter gets the blame for not only the direction but also for the terrible script and the score that he swiped from 'The Exorcist.' Curtis is pretty good in her film debut.",4,2,5,3 April 2009
Carrie," Campy Comedy
","A shy high school student who has led a very sheltered life becomes the target of bullies before she unleashes her wrath upon them. Spacek manages to make her character sympathetic, but she, like all the actors here, was in her late 20's, too old to be believable as a high school student. Laurie is hilariously over the top as Carrie's mother, a God-fearing woman. The special effects are cheesy. It's somewhat enjoyable if one treats it like a campy comedy, which it is unintentionally. The last 15 minutes unfolds in slow motion and drag on for about half an hour; perhaps De Palma did not shoot enough footage to meet the requisite running time.",6,1,7,28 September 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Falls
","Batman used to be a fun character. Then Nolan took over and ran the franchise into the ground. 'Batman Begins' was not bad actually, but 'The Dark Knight' was terrible. His third effort in the series hits a new low, an agonizingly long and tedious affair featuring a convoluted but sophomoric story riddled with cartoon characters. With his inane script and sluggish direction, Nolan once again demonstrates why he is one of the biggest hacks working in the movies these days. Although it has a large, impressive cast of familiar faces, none of the characters is the least bit interesting. Only good news is rumors that this might be Nolan's last Batman film.",1,6,14,12 January 2013
Iron Man," Leaden
","The head of a company that makes national defense weapons is kidnapped by Arabs and develops an iron armor to escape, later using the suit to become a super hero. This film seems like a rehash of Batman and Spiderman except it is much worse than any film in those two series. The director's obsession with tedious special effects adds to the woes of an awful script. The climactic battle between Good Medium-Sized Iron Man and Bad Over-Sized Iron Man is utterly ridiculous. Downey gives a pretty good performance, keeping this from becoming a total failure. The best thing about the film is the relationship between him and Paltrow. The worst is that stupid device in Iron Man's chest.",3,2,6,27 December 2008
Blade Runner," Raider of the Lost Replicants
","In this cult favorite, a detective tracks down dangerous replicants in a dark, seedy Los Angelos of the future. Scott creates a memorably bleak atmosphere, but the plot is not compelling enough to draw in the viewer. The camera spends too much time slowly panning over the futuristic sets. Ford does OK as the raider of the lost replicants but the characters are thinly drawn and too far removed from reality to be interesting. Hauer is intense as usual as the lead replicant and Cassidy shows her stuff as a butt-kicking replicant. The climactic battle between Ford and Hauer is disappointing, marked by scenes repulsive violence.",6,0,3,16 August 2006
Ben-Hur," Epic Entertainment
","The story of a Jewish prince who lived in the time of Christ in Jerusalem becomes an impressive screen epic. Heston gives one of his best performances in the title role. Boyd makes a worthy rival as a Roman leader. Harareet's looks are better than her acting. Despite its excessive length, Wyler manages to keeps things moving at a nice pace for the most part. The justly famous chariot race is tremendously exciting. Unfortunately the film goes on for nearly an hour after the race and gets somewhat bogged down in switching focus to the story of Christ. The cinematography is sweeping and colorful and Rozsa's score is appropriately majestic.",8,0,2,10 August 2008
Casino Royale," Bond Rating is Down
","Craig seems to be the wrong choice to take over the role of 007. He is serious and mean-spirited instead of suave and witty, as we have come to expect of Bond. Unlike other Bonds, the pre-credits sequence is dull. While some of the action scenes are well executed, the excitement is not sustained because the plot is choppy and convoluted. Bond is newly minted as 007 in this one but the film takes place in 2006, totally oblivious to all the previous Bond films. There is no chemistry between Craig and Green and their romance becomes too sappy. Bond films are supposed to be silly and fun, laced with babes, gadgets, and double-entendres. This one take itself too seriously and goes on far too long.",6,10,17,2 July 2007
Trainspotting," Revolting
","This rambling film looks at Scottish teens doing drugs. There isn't much of a plot. The teens sit around shooting heroin and talking about mostly uninteresting things in thick accents laden with Scottish slang. There are some repulsive scenes, such McGregor sticking his hands into the filthiest toilet in Scotland right having done his business and before flushing it. We are also treated to blood-splattering violence and scenes of needles penetrating the skin. While Boyle displays an interesting visual style, it is not clear what the point of this film is. It's either glorifying drugs or saying that drugs are bad. Either way, it does not qualify as entertainment.",3,10,23,3 April 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Pretentious Woody
","Two American women spend a summer in Barcelona and become involved with a local artist with a psycho ex-wife. Bardem is the stereotypical European artist with a tortured soul who is so irresistible to women that they are willing to share his bed five minutes after meeting him. Hall and Johansson are OK as the women who can't stay away from him. The film is pretentious and rather boring until Cruz enters the picture half way through as Bardem's crazed ex-wife, bringing with her the energy and passion that the film otherwise lacks. The score is tiresome and the superfluous narration is annoying. Allen continues to churn them out annually although he rarely has anything fresh to offer.",7,0,3,5 December 2009
Identity," Ludicrous Thriller
","A group of strangers is stranded at a remote motel on a stormy night, as a killer strikes. This thriller, patterned after 'And Then There Were None,' gets off to an intriguing if silly start, as a convoluted premise is used to gather the victims at the motel. In fact, it has the makings of a delicious black comedy, but that's a road not taken. As the victims start falling, the film becomes increasingly ludicrous until it reaches a mind-blowing, idiotic resolution. Until things fall apart at the end, it is fairly entertaining, although the violence is off-putting. It's a shame that it doesn't add up to much because it has a pretty good cast.",4,1,5,7 January 2013
Speed," Stupid
","A cop is having a bad day, having to deal first with an elevator booby-trapped with a bomb, then a bus, and finally a train. Apparently the filmmakers were saving an airplane for the sequel. It starts off stupid and gets stupider as it goes along. The script is mind-numbingly idiotic and doesn't know when to call it a day. The direction is so incompetent that De Bont should have been forced to go back to his day job of cinematographer. Reeves is OK as an action hero but looks lost if he has to flex any acting muscles, such as the scenes where he tries to show anger. Bullock is given little to do except look cute, which she manages quite well. Hopper is a shameless ham.",4,5,13,7 August 2011
Amélie," Annoying
","A smug-faced Parisian pixie with a tenuous grasp of reality decides she is going to influence other people's lives whether they like it or not. Amelie has got to be one of the most annoying characters in recent cinema. She is mousy, meddlesome, mean, and manipulative - and these characteristics are supposed to make her lovable. The film operates under the concept that quirky equals charming. The narration is supposed to be cute and funny, but is grating instead. The plot rambles on pointlessly. The director repeatedly uses zooms and weird sound effects to convey some sort of whimsical film-making but manages to simply be distracting. It's unbelievable that this won an Oscar.",4,29,53,17 November 2009
The Producers," Utterly Unfunny
","A sleazy producer conspires with his meek accountant to stage a flop play so that they can pocket the investments. And hilarity ensues...Not! Brooks made his film debut as director and writer with this lame comedy that inexplicably won a screenplay Oscar and is regarded as a classic. Although it is mercifully short, there is not a single chuckle-worthy moment in the entire film. The vaudevillian comedy is sophomoric and utterly unfunny. Everybody overacts embarrassingly. Ironically, the only good thing about this turkey is the 'Springtime for Hitler' number that the audience is supposed to find atrocious.",3,10,21,28 September 2010
Rear Window," A Stunning View
","Bound to a wheelchair following an accident, a photographer passes time by spying on his neighbors and believes that one of them has committed a murder. Hitchcock was at the peak of his creative powers in the 1950s, and this is one of his masterpieces. He's quite innovative in using a single, confined set to tell his suspenseful story. Stewart perfectly conveys the frustrations, fears, and vulnerabilities of the hapless photographer. Kelly's brief career peaked in 1954 and this is arguably her best film. Ritter is marvelous as Stewart's wisecracking caregiver. Interestingly, Burr, who plays the murder suspect here, would go on to play the wheelchair-bound cop Ironside on TV.",10,0,1,9 April 2010
The Matrix," Silly
","Extremely silly nonsense about a future where machines have taken over the world and life on earth is a virtual reality controlled by computer programs in some alternate universe. This is one of the worst movies from a major studio, featuring a convoluted and boring plot that's all over the place and goes on way too long. The slow-motion fight scenes are laughably bad. Reeves looks lost throughout the movie. Fishburne spews clichés as some sort of a zen master. The Wachowski Brothers, who showed so much promise with 'Bound,' their first feature, not only wrote the terrible script but also dreamed up the lame special effects. This is an utter waste of time.",1,10,24,26 January 2008
Casino," Narrated for the Blind
","Fueled by mob bosses, two long-time friends make it big in Las Vegas. Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in 'Goodfellas,' but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their 'Goodfellas' roles. Stone is alluring.",6,2,3,28 September 2010
Heat," Not So Hot
","This cops and robbers film has a stupid script but boasts an impressive cast. Pacino has some good moments but generally chews the scenery as a cop trying to nab the bad guys while dealing with family issues. DeNiro plays pretty much the same role he played in 'Goodfellas.' While Pacino screams, Kilmer and Voight, both sporting long blonde locks, mumble their lines in such low tones that they are barely comprehensible, causing the viewer to constantly adjust the volume. Mann directs with the slickness of a video game, but the film becomes tiresome because there are too many characters and plot lines. It is much too long; the quality of a film is not measured by its length.",6,2,9,5 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Long Time Ago, It Started
","The one that began it all is also the best in the series. Whereas the later films become too bogged down with plot and perhaps take themselves too seriously, this one is just plain fun. It pays homage to the great adventure films of yesteryear, including 'The Searchers.' Hamill and Fisher failed to capitalize on the success of this series while Ford parlayed his role as the wise-cracking Han Solo into super-stardom. Despite his disdain for the film, Guinness is masterful as Obi-Wan. The majestic score by John Williams definitely adds to the excitement. Interestingly, Lucas did not direct the two sequels, but returned to direct the second trilogy.",9,4,6,12 October 2007
Thirteen Days," Focus is Off
","In this dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, President Kennedy must deal with Soviet aggression as tension mounts. Although the historical event has built-in suspense, the filmmakers manage to sap the excitement to some extent by rambling on too long and lingering too much on uninteresting details. The main problem is that the focus is not on Kennedy, but on O'Donnell, the cabinet member played by Costner whose importance in the crisis is exaggerated in this account. To make matters worse, Costner sports a laughable and horribly distracting Boston accent. Culp is also a bit too mannered as RFK. Greenwood, on the other hand, gives a finely understated performance as Kennedy.",6,1,3,26 December 2012
300," Bloody Awful
","300 Spartan men in underwear and capes go against a Persian army of tens of thousands and manage to cut off a lot of Persian body parts. The computer-generated imagery looks cold, gray, and depressing in this bloody recreation of the events of 480 BC, based on Miller's graphic novel. Unlike 'Sin City,' another Miller work that was successfully transferred to the screen by Miller himself, this one fails miserably under the overwrought direction of Snyder. The acting consists of little more than flexed muscles and gnashed teeth. Snyder's obsession with slow motion is maddening. Without slow motion, used in every other scene for no apparent reason, the movie would only last about 42 minutes.",1,6,14,26 October 2007
Jackie Brown," Entertaining
","Grier, a star of 'blaxploitation' films of the 1970s, is back in this tribute to such films, playing the title role of a flight attendant who becomes a pawn between the police and a notorious arms dealer. In adapting the Elmore Leonard novel, Tarantino shows himself to be an expert story-teller, keeping the film consistently entertaining despite the long running time. Considering the film's theme and the director's obsession with violence, this one is surprisingly and refreshingly restrained on that front. The interesting characters are fleshed out by an excellent cast, with Forster particularly impressive in an understated performance as a lonely, middle-aged bail bondsman.",8,0,2,2 May 2010
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Tedious Nonsense
","King Arthur and his men search for the Holy Grail. Hilarity ensues...sporadically. There are some amusing exchanges of dialog, but collectively the funny bits constitute about 15 minutes of the running time. The rest of the comedy is so forced and tedious, including the overly cute opening credits, that it takes forever for the hour and a half to pass. The prancing about making hoof noises with coconuts is stupid enough, but then there are these lame animations that are not the least bit amusing. The sets are apparently meant to be cheesy, but they are so cheap-looking that most TV commercials have better production values than this eyesore.",3,7,21,7 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire Strikes Out
","The second 'Star Wars' film to be released has non-stop action, but the problem is that there is no compelling plot to make the action interesting. Endless shots of star ships gliding through space soon become tedious. The last third of the movie does generate some interest but it's too little, too late to save this from being more than a mediocre entry in the series. The other problem is that it just stops abruptly, relying too much on the sequel to clean up the loose ends. The dialog is amateurish and there is too much emphasis on special effects. Yoda is cute but Chewbacca and R2-D2 become increasingly annoying with the silly noises they make.",7,6,14,12 October 2007
Saboteur," Enjoyable Grade B Hitchcock
","Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the lam, looking for the real culprit. The familiar Hitchcock theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is nicely played out in this entertaining fare that has elements of 'The Thirty Nine Steps' and 'North by Northwest,' although it is not as good as either of those classics. There are some impressive set pieces, including the finale on the Statue of Liberty. The plot is implausible and unconvincing and, after a terrific start, it seems to run out of steam. Cummings is likable if somewhat stiff in the lead. Lane is the blonde but not the cool variety of the director's later films. The supporting roles are generally well played.",7,1,2,20 September 2006
Gangs of New York," Ugly and Overlong
","Gangs engage in turf war in 1860s New York. This is yet another example of Scorsese's disturbing obsession with violence. The film starts and ends with ludicrous battle scenes. In between there are some good moments but there is too much padding, needlessly extending the running time to nearly three hours. It's obvious from the outset how it's going to end, but the narrative meanders and is often over-the-top. The gritty atmosphere of mid 19th century New York is well captured, but the director's depiction of 19th century New York was more impressive in 'The Age of Innocence,' also featuring Day-Lewis. Here Day-Lewis chews the scenery as a ruthless butcher. DiCaprio looks intense.",4,1,6,7 August 2011
Braveheart," Inept Epic
","In the 13th century, Scots battle to overthrow the English and gain independence. This is nothing but a big, bloated turkey that seems like it's never going to end. It is not clear where Gibson is worse - the hammy performance in front of the camera or the inept direction behind it. Gibson often has the camera linger on himself as he strikes heroic poses. Too much screen time is devoted to bloody battle scenes, causing the film to become increasingly tedious. The only respite from the repulsive bloodbath is romantic scenes that look like shampoo commercials. We also have Gibson to thank for showing us what's under those kilts.",4,10,20,30 December 2011
True Romance," True Revulsion
","Man and hooker fall in love after one night of watching Kung Fu movies and get married and then he goes off to kill her pimp. The beginning is stupid and amateurish. Then the mob gets involved and it gets better, thanks to the infusion of humor and the presence of the likes of Hopper, Walken, Gandolfini, and Pitt. However, Slater and Arquette are unappealing and annoying as the leads and their characters are clichés. The violence is gratuitous and revolting. Why do directors think watching people get cut is entertaining or artistic? Scott so overuses the closeup that it loses its purpose; he should get a few pointers from his brother, Ridley, about the fine art of directing.",6,1,4,2 June 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Over-Boyled
","The film captures the color and vibrancy of Mumbai, but the script is stupid, amateurish, contrived, melodramatic, and completely illogical. The preposterous notion that a game show contestant suspected of cheating would be tortured by the police is an insult to India. A competent director may have overcome the shortcomings of the script, but Boyle is obsessed with his distracting visual style (tilted camera, fast inter-cutting, excessive closeups) at the expense of story and character development and acting. His over-indulgent style is better suited to music videos. Also, as with his earlier 'Trainspotting,' this one features a revolting toilet scene. What's with that?",6,6,11,3 May 2009
Gladiator," High Level of Excitement
","In ancient Rome, a gladiator seeks revenge against the emperor's son after the latter kills his family. Despite the extensive running time, the film does not drag at all. The credit for this goes to Scott, who directs with a sure hand and sustains a high level of excitement. However, scenes of bloody violence are gratuitous. The script may not be historically accurate but it is surely entertaining. Crowe is fine in the title role, turning in a quietly effective performance. Equally good is Phoenix as the evil emperor, a despicable weasel. Nielsen has little to do other than look worried but she looks quite beautiful doing it.",8,0,0,30 December 2011
Donnie Darko," Tedious Nonsense
","This is a bizarre sci-fi film about a dysfunctional family, with an unstable teen-aged son who talks to a large rabbit. Where's Jimmy Stewart when you need him? Unlike 'Harvey,' this one isn't played for laughs. The characters are poorly drawn and none of them are likable. The Darko family is so cartoon-like that it's hard to care what happens to them.The script is meant to be thought-provoking but is instead headache-inducing. It's nonsensical, overlong, tedious, indulgent, and pointless. Kelly, directing his first feature film, is in over his head, unsure about what kind of movie he wants to make. Kelly is also responsible for the lame script.",3,6,11,4 July 2010
The Social Network," Geek Tragedy
","This film chronicles the founding of the website Facebook. The story is told in flashbacks, turning a simple tale into a rather clumsy narrative. It is somewhat of a geek tragedy in that Zuckerberg, the founder of the most successful social network ever built, is a social misfit - basically a rude, arrogant jerk. Yes, it's the story of the little guy who makes it big, but the little guy is such a wet blanket that one can't root for him. Eisenberg delivers his lines so rapidly that one has to strain to understand what he's saying. Sprinking the dialog with technical jargon doesn't help matters. It's entertaining for the most part, but never rises above mediocrity.",7,1,2,22 March 2011
Back to the Future," Entertaining
","In this entertaining sci-fi comedy, a young man is inadvertently sent back 30 years via a time machine (a Delorean car) and unwittingly interferes with the mating of his parents, thereby putting his future in jeopardy. The plot is silly and full of holes, but it is fun to watch. Most of the characters are stereotypes that seem to have stepped out of sitcoms. Fox became a star with this film and Thompson is good as his mother. This was an early success for the talented Zemeckis, who keeps the action moving at a fast clip. The scenes leading to the trip back to the future are very exiting and well executed. This film was a huge success and was followed by a couple of sequels.",8,1,1,6 January 2008
Goodfellas," Good, Bad, and Ugly Fellas
","This movie is about despicable characters committing deplorable acts yet it manages to be interesting if overlong, with too much time spent establishing the gangster lifestyle that we already know about from films such as 'The Godfather.' Once it gets going about half way through, however, it becomes rather compelling. Scorsese is the master of this sort of film, although his trademark obsession with violence is disturbing. De Niro plays the same character that he has played in a dozen movies. Although there are no likable characters, Pesci's is the worst. Bracco is sexy. Liotta is creepy-looking. This one probably holds the record for the number of f-words uttered.",8,0,0,2 May 2008
Jurassic Park," Mild Amusement Park
","Cloned dinosaurs run amok at an amusement park! Yes, the plot is as ridiculous as it sounds. However, even if one accepts the silly premise, the film rarely rises above the level of a 1950s monster movie like Godzilla and it goes on too long. It's not clear why the dinos are angry, perhaps they're thinking, we came back after 65 million years for this cheesy movie? The computer-generated creatures (no actual dinosaurs were harmed during the filming) are the main attraction here and they're fairly well done. Goldblum has some funny lines and seems to be having fun. The rest of the performances are so mundane that they may as well have been computer generated.",6,3,7,15 May 2009
All the President's Men," Journalism 101
","This is an authentic-looking recreation of the investigative work done by Washington Post reporters in uncovering the Watergate scandal. Redford and Hoffman are convincing as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, who wrote the book that the movie is based on. Warden and Balsam, two of the '12 Angry Men,' are fine as senior editors while Robards is marvelous as executive editor Ben Bradlee. It is probably the best film ever about investigative journalism, although it does tend to become too bogged down at times with minute details and name-dropping. While there isn't much suspense (the outcome is already known), it is a fascinating look at how a major newspaper operates.",8,1,2,30 September 2010
The Fighter," Loser
","The story follows the same basic narrative as just about every other boxing movie ever made. The only thing that differentiates this film from others about boxing is the people surrounding the boxer. Unfortunately, there's little to like about those people. It is hard to feel any sympathy for these characters because they are the very definition of 'poor white trash.' Poor script and direction don't help matters. Wahlberg is rather bland in the title role, and there's no way he is a welter weight. Bale is annoying as his crack-addicted brother, with much of what he says unintelligible due to slurring and mumbling. Adams outshines her costars as a tough broad.",6,0,2,7 August 2011
Up in the Air," The Road of Life
","Working for a corporate downsizing company, a man flies around the country firing people. Clooney is well cast as the man who loves his road job because he has nothing to come home to. Farmiga is fine as a worldly woman Clooney meets and romances on the road. Rounding out the trio of main characters is Kendrick as a spunky young woman with bright ideas and little life experience. It is solidly directed by Reitman, who lets the characters evolve and interact without forcing the issue. There is not much of a plot; the point here is getting to know the characters on the road of life. And in this fine mixture of comedy and drama, the characters are worth spending some time with.",8,0,2,9 April 2010
Atonement," Astonishing
","An imaginative and spoiled child of a rich family accuses a servant of sexual abuse, leading to tragic consequences. Director Wright brings an astonishing visual elegance to the film, so much so that many of the shots look contrived, but one can't help but admire the beauty of the compositions. There is a cut-free five-minute tracking shot of soldiers on Dunkirk beach. Basically, Wright is showing off with this shot, but it's still impressive. Not impressive enough, however, to nab him an Oscar nomination for Best Director. The acting is excellent, particularly McAvoy as the servant boy and Garai as his accuser at an older age, seeking atonement for her actions as a child.",8,0,1,4 July 2010
V for Vendetta," V for Very Good
","In a future where Great Britain is a fascist state ruled by a Big Brother-like figure, a masked revolutionary wages war against the powers that be by terrorist means. This engaging drama is an impressive directorial debut for McTigue, who obviously has been influenced by the Wachowski brothers, with whom he worked on the Matrix films. The visual imagery is rather striking if sometimes overtly symbolic. Portman turns in a fine performance as a young woman who becomes allied with V, the masked man. Although we never see his face, Weaving brings surprising depth to the role of V. Ironically, Hurt, who tried to escape the oppression of Big Brother in 'Nineteen Eighty-Four,' plays the Big Brother figure here.",8,0,3,11 October 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Meandering Comedy
","The Coen Brothers ought to be applauded for attempting to make a film out of 'The Oddyssey,' but it goes about as well well as one would expect of a film made out of an ancient epic poem. It has its moments but the narrative is too meandering to hold together. Clooney is fine, as is the rest of the cast, but the comedy is too broad to make this anything more than a curiosity piece. The songs are tuneful, particularly 'The Man of Constant Sorrow.' The title of the film pays homage to the Preston Sturges classic 'Sullivan's Travels,' in which Joel McCrea, tired of making fluff, aspires to make a serious film with this title.",6,1,2,26 December 2012
The Godfather," Mafia 101
","The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.",10,7,12,27 December 2008
