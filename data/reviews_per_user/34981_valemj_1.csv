Marie Antoinette," I would have rather seen The Marine...This movie was awful.
","The screenplay was probably only 2 pages long. There was no dialogue, literally. This movie was a huge disappointment; I wanted to see beautiful shots of Versailles for 2 and half hours I would look pictures up on the internet, but I ended up paying 9 dollars to do so. I felt dirty after I left the theatre, so I went home and took a cold shower. If you want to see this movie, do yourself a favor take the money you were about to buy the ticket with and either flush it down the toilet, or go to a bookstore and buy a paperback novel that interests you. I, like I am sure many other people was expecting witty dialogue and another take historically on the life of Marie Antoinette, but what we got was a boring half-ass effort, which would make Francis Ford Coppola want to change his last name.",1,24,49,23 October 2006
