The Avengers," It does what it came to do (and maybe a bit more)
","I just came out of the cinemas from watching it on the first day and I have to admit it was better than I expected. I expected an action movie with awesome graphics and fight scenes, and that's what you get, world class entertainment. I enjoyed the character development and subtle hints that give a bigger meaning. Also this movie has a chunk of comedy, not the annoying kind but the kind that blends into the movie perfectly to give you a laugh but not take away the seriousness of the film (too much). It was clich√© but what can you expect. The actor's are flawless and keep up with who they are meant to be. The only part I really didn't like, but also didn't expect was the lack of feeling. A lot of the good movies I watch I come out feeling different, like the movie has effected me, but I felt nothing, (except for one part but it wasn't enough to give a real feeling to the movie). All in all, this is an action packed movie, sure to give you entertainment, not boring at all, funny, has some smart moments and a must see movie for anyone.",8,4,10,25 April 2012
