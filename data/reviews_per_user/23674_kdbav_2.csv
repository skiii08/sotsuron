The Blair Witch Project," Really scary *NOT*
","Imagine 3 moaning and complaining teenagers that manage to get lost in the woods while having a map and a compass. You got it: not quite smart... Started out promising, though: this could have been a fine mystery. Nice interviews with the townspeople. Unfortunately the lack of acting, music, story and plot make this the most boring thing ever put on celluloid (even Picnic at hanging rock by Peter Weir was more entertaining and if that wasn't boring what is?). It wasn't scary and what's more it wasn't even funny, 'witch' is a main feature of any horror movie I had seen so far...",Null,1,2,11 November 2001
Memento," Avoid at all cost
","In short: this is an arty-f*rty, unbelievably overrated, I-would-like-to-be-David-Lynch movie without any interesting acting or a story worth remembering. There are major plot holes that don't get filled. The acting is below average: three sorts of expressions on the main character is all we get.It ends before the story starts (telling a story backwards, means you stop with the beginning, doesn't it?).Some may think that people with high IQ's would probably like it.Trust me, they don't.This is a real waste of time and a major contender for the 'overhyped motion picture of all times' award.",1,4,12,30 December 2011
