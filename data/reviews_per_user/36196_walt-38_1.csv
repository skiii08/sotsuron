Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas fell asleep
","I would like to start this review on a positive note.  I loved the special effects.  I have never seen anything like them.  The fighting scenes between Jedi were the most awe-inspiring I have ever seen in any movie.Now for the things that I thought were bad.  The space fighter scenes were lacking in comparison to the original trilogy.  The viewer doesn't get to know the good guys like one does in episodes 4-6. I also didn't like how Anakin just does everything by accident. Lucas could have explained some sort of connection with the force.I also thought that Lucas left some of the scenes unfinished.  One of the scenes left unfinished was Darth Maul on Tatooine.  Lucas could have anything happen to make that a little more realistic.All in all, I thought that this movie is a poor showing of Lucas's perfectionism that we all know.  It seems that he rushed the movie.  I don't understand how someone could make a move for 16 years and still rush it.Now for what I rate the movie.  If it were not a Star Wars movie it would have been much better in my mind.  As a regular movie I give it a 8.5.  As a Star Wars movie, a 5.  This is based on the above comments and the other three movies.  Lucas swayed too much from the equation that worked in the original movies, and this takes a lot away from Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.  I am hoping that episodes 2 and 3 make me change my mind about the quality of this move or I will be a very disappointed Star Wars fan.",7,0,1,28 May 1999
