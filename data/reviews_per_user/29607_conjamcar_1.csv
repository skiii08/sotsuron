Blade Runner 2049," Solid Sci-Fi
","I really liked the original, and this follow up is quite good as well. It is not as campy as the original. The storyline is fairly direct, and the twist and turns flow. You get enough of the future creepy dynamics that good sci-fi always has, and just enough moral dilemma, without being preachy. Gosling (K), does a good job of carrying you through the movie.",9,0,3,26 January 2018
