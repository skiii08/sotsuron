Blade Runner 2049," Unbelievable cinematography, incredible boring
","Undoubtedly is Blade Runner (1982) my all time best movie, a real masterpiece which I gave a 10/10 score, the only movie I ever quoted that high at IMDb. What a disappointment to watch this sequel. Even Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets was less boring. Why for G'd s sake, the 75-year old Harrison Ford, who's career already ended about 20 years ago, had to play such a big sequence in this movie. Mainly for commercial reasons I guess. I don't get this one. With his role he probably damaged the concept of this movie more then any one else could do. Anyway, the cinematography, the music and the sound were excellent. I really love the sound of this movie. But never compare it with the music of Blade Runner (1982) made by Vangelis. Maybe, when I watch this movie a few times more, it will be better. But I am afraid that it won't change my first impression.Lucky me that Ridley Scott gave me so much more p.e. Prometheus, The Martian, American Gangster, Hannibal and the Alien movies. Thanks for that Ridley, you are my master of suspense, quality and entertainment.",7,4,9,23 October 2017
