Sucker Punch," True to its purpose.
","I've seen a lot of reviews lately hating on the haters who want a good plot in their action movies, telling them that they simply need to 'suspend' their disbelief. How many times must we do this before we lose track of what really makes a good movie? Big names and explosions don't give any reason or excuse for a film to not have a plot or meaning. Sorry folks, that's not a movie you are watching, it's a nice soundtrack and a whole lot of TNT on set. Your seven to nine dollars is better spent elsewhere to further your intellect. However, I am pleased to announce to all you action junkies and more sophisticated, plot-wanting movie goers alike, there is a decent amount of both in this mind-bending adventure, albeit a little more of the former. The story is set in no time, within five minutes of the opening scene one realizes what is most likely going to end up happening. However, the story stays true to its purpose and doesn't linger on unnecessary flashbacks, thoughts, or fills. No, like the characters that it portrays, the story moves without a dull moment with a purpose not seen in movies like these very often. Pounding through obstacles and trials, it carries an audience through each scene with a gritty grace that matches the setting wonderfully.Don't lose hope now all you testosterone-filled he-men out there. This only means that all those explosions, guns, and slo-mo action scenes make sense and are happening for a reason. Let me tell you that there are enough of them to make even the biggest dreamer satisfied. I should know, I'm one of them. You guys know that feeling when it seems that you could have directed that part in the movie it matched your style so perfectly? There were a few of those in this one. I almost could feel Zach Snyder reading my mind asking me how to make certain fight scenes. Crazy stuff. But you all know what I'm talking about.The movie does not apologize for what it is. The noir feel of the lens and ironic choices of music combine for a great cinematic experience. It is definitely an eye opener and should keep one in their seat, if for nothing else, the filming style. Bottom line? Watch it. But be careful if you have younger ones as it has a PG-13 rating, but some of the story can get a little um... risqu√©. A few foul words too. Just sayin'. If you appreciate it as nothing else. Respect it as an art. It was beautifully directed and deserves to at least be given a shot. Excuse the pun.",8,3,10,26 March 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Finally, a hero with character and not money, brains, or women.
","There was an atmosphere around Captain America that other superhero movies seem to be lacking in different amounts and that is the likability and humility of the way this particular hero is portrayed. Odd enough, as America is often branded as being the epitome of arrogance and pride. But instead of being somewhat disgusted with the protagonist's bravado and sleazy 'charm' as other movies may want you to completely buy into, I found myself cheering for Captain America, not because I didn't want evil to win, but because I didn't want good to lose. It seems to me like some of the more recent super hero movies force the audience to cheer for the lesser evil. Sure, the hero's a jerk, but hey, if he doesn't do anything about it then the world will explode. Yay, hero. Captain America has you cheering for him the whole way through because he keeps his integrity and stays true to what he stands for. The movie is quite clean, funny, and keeps its head on track. The villains are evil enough, but not obsessively dark as if trying to be villainy. The only small gripe I had was that I wanted to see more of Captain America in action! I know this was an origin story so we had to keep it simple and build the base of this hero but to see a couple more built up action scenes of Captain hitting people with his shield would have been great! Don't get me wrong, the ones they had were fine, but I just would have liked to see more is all. The effects were great, I wasn't concerned with plot holes or awkward gaps, and it kept my interest(most important factor in my book). Just got back from the 12:00 screening and ran out before I had to listen to all the goofy comic book nerds rave about what they just saw. From a total newbie to this comic-screen adaption, this was a pleasant experience that I would recommend. 8/10",8,10,26,22 July 2011
