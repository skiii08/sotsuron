The Incredible Hulk," Horrible movie
","You know how some movies make you want to get popcorn and a drink just to enjoy the movie that much better? This one put me to sleep. Considering how much dumber General Ross got, this also added a ton more openings in the story line. Not to mention the worst part is, the CGI and the camera worked was completely horrible. In several scenes you will notice a very clear difference in hulks. You will have the 2 foot taller hulk who looks like he works out every day at the gym but nothing hard. Then you have the massive, I'm throwing this car and ill just do it with just 1 hand..ha ha. Sorry bad joke, but honestly I wouldn't even rent the movie nor waste my money to see this. I wish I saw Iron man again. If you want my opinion...save your gas money and food money for batman. That just cant be a disappointment.",4,3,7,20 June 2008
Suicide Squad," Confusing and horrible screening (Possible spoilers)
","I think this actually is the worst movie all year long.The introduction was horrific in that made 0 sense in the set up. I felt like the style that DC went with was close to Batman Forever when they went neon crazy.Only a few of the characters were done well, the rest were atrocious to the names they played. I don't blame the actors/actresses but the director and whoever wrote this movie. I am not sure how the actors weren't outraged by how complied the movie and left out (I am hoping left out) very important details about the story/characters.Random scenes will happen through out this movie that leave you in a confused state as to which why they were placed there. Other scenes in the movie cut out something that was crucial to the plot. Marvel does 1 thing well and that is the humor in the movies. DC almost completely left out humor. Most of the humor you already saw in the trailer and when you see it, its not that funny anymore. If you are a comic book reader or avid DC fan, you will not enjoy this movie. If you have no idea what is going on then you will most likely just see missed scenes and confusion.Deadshot, Joker, Harley Quinn really made this movie and truth be told...They needed more joker.",2,1,2,5 August 2016
