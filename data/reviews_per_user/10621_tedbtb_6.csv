Ford v Ferrari," Forgot any bad reviews...See it!!!!
","Two words....Timeless epic! Went into this movie thinking it was another attempt to use a star studded cast to take my money and grab my Interest. That's exactly what it was and I've never been happier. Film is expertly written, expertly performed and expertly directed. One of those once in every two years kind of film, one you can pull out on a rainy night in 10 years from now and be ever so glad you did. It Is long....it is a typical testosterone film....but it's so worth the watch!!!!! Brilliant!!!!",10,3,6,20 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Classic Quentin
",Exactly what it says on the tin....or at the top of the cover in this case. What we've come to know and love from Tarantino films....the acting is immense and the ability to twist fact with fiction in the storyline is transitionally smooth and unexpected. You know it's coming....but you never know where or when. Must watch!,8,1,2,16 November 2019
The Dark Knight," Speaks for itself
","One of the greats! The acting is unparalleled all round. The storyline has as much twisting and turning to it as a flamenco dancer. If you haven't seen it, your not only missing out, you letting one of the Da Vinci's of the film industry pass you by.",9,2,2,16 November 2019
When Harry Met Sally...," A classic
","A film to cheer up the lull of a Monday afternoon. A classic Meg Ryan film. Harry met sally focuses on the push and pull of both sexes. The film achieves this through the use of comedy. Its clever and almost silly one liners are incredibly quotable and leave a smirk on the face no matter how many times of viewing. The transition of the protagonists in terms of growth is, for the most part, largely predictable, but hugely enjoyable. Relatable and memorable moments will create an everlasting archive of quotes and similarities that can be summoned occasion after occasion in later life.",8,2,2,16 November 2019
Man on Fire," 'Creasy's art is death'
","A phenomenal composite of emotions. First watched this film years back and have just again re-watched it. Have never understood the mixed bag of reviews. There's seems to be an underlying comparison of Scott vs Tarantino from the more 'verified' reviewers that undoubtedly takes away from a masterclass of acting in of itself. The storyline has an astounding gradualism, slowly easing you in to understanding the pain of the protagonist; 'Creasy', who is Clearly haunted and disillusioned from his inescapable past. 'Nothing more dangerous than a man alone with his thoughts' rings true. As the movie progresses, the relationship between both Pita and Creasy intensifies. 'He shows her that it's okay to live again'. The U-turn this takes when she is taken away is sharp. The movie adopts a heads and tails kind of approach with so much pain and emotion initially, to so much anger and violence eventually. This U-turn is both gripping and exhilarating, it will have your eyes unblinkingly hypnotised to the screen. As of all good films, the ending is not one to disappoint. You will either cry at the knowing sadness of loosing Creasy or the love that Pita and Creasy both have for one another. It's simply one or the other. Master piece!",9,2,2,16 November 2019
American Gangster," 'Now, where was I?'
","A rainy day, late night kind of film. The quality of acting, directing and overall storyline will cement a place in the memory long after watching. Has a realism and unpredictability to it that is rarely achieved in other gangster style drug related films. One of the best! And one of my go too's! Tremendous performances from both Washington and Crowe. Can't recommend highly enough.",9,8,10,16 November 2019
