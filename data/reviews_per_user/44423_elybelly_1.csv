Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," How did this receive an R rating?
","'Strong and crude sexual content' does not even BEGIN to describe the numerous inappropriate scenes in this film. By no means would I consider myself a prude. In fact, as a red-blooded college student I would say that when it comes to film I tend to lean liberal. Like everyone else, I had seen previews of 'Borat' and was expecting to see him in the yellow thong, I was braced for some nudity, I was even prepared to politely giggle at the several references to incest sprinkled throughout the film. What I was not prepared for, by any means, was the 6.5 minute long nude scene that occurs 30 minutes before the end of the film. For those of you who insist on seeing this movie, I will spare you anything that may be considered a 'spoiler'. Just suffice it to say that after the aforementioned that another reviewer has deemed a 'racier scene', I was ready to walk out. The scene wound up being a blight on an otherwise predictable film. The only parts that were amusing were those that have already been plastered throughout television commercials and movie previews. If you are queasy (and I think anyone would be after seeing this movie), save yourself the $10 and watch the trailers.",2,12,27,4 November 2006
