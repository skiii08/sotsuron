The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Beautiful
","I've just came back home from the cinema. This picture is shown nowadays as a part of Czech film show called 'Projekt 100'. I decided in the afternoon to go and see it. I had no idea what the film is like. And now I am back - fully impressed. Wow. How can somebody touch one's deepest feelings so strongly? In the middle of the film I caught myself all shivering because of the beauty wishing that it never ends. I've seen lots of great movies, but this is one of the best, I can say. The colours, the music, the story, the people, their eyes, old streets, trees and leaves... Amazing work Mr. Kieslowski! Thank you. PS> I haven't seen any of his films before. Are the other ones also that beautiful? I must see The three colours trilogy soon.",10,7,13,14 January 2006
