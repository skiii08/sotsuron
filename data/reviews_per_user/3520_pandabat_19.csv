Marie Antoinette," Art Imitates Marie Antoinette's Life - Vacant and Meaningless
","For all intents and purposes, this is a fashion show that has been turned into a movie. Yes, the costumes are sumptuous, and yes, the palatial backdrops are majestic, but somewhere along the way it was forgotten that movies should have a story of some sort or enough heart and soul to make up for the lack of same. For me, this effort had neither.It begins well enough with the Austrian princess being sent to France for an arranged marriage to cement the newly formed allegiance between France and Austria. Her youthful exuberance combined with exasperation and bewilderment at the ways of the French court provide some levity, as indeed does the awkwardness of her fledging relationship with Louis August, who is portrayed as a young man who lacks confidence with members of the opposite sex. At least that is what we must assume and this is where the movie begins to falter, for it does not go on to make a character of Louis nor do so of any other player. All except Marie Antoinette are paper thin types, two-dimensional entities appearing on-screen for a time to say some words but add little else. We do not know why Louis is so distant or if, following the birth of the couple's first child, he remains a truly distant husband or really resembles a lukewarm lover. Schwartzmann is truly wasted in this role.That said, it is only after the first child's birth that we see that the movie may change direction. There are beautiful and lovingly shot scenes where we see Marie Antoinette blossom in motherhood and experience a blissful return to nature from the indulgent excesses of the court. This too however must pass and when we return to the court with the protagonist, we also return to her boring, empty life there. The director might have been trying to get some of this across but I doubt that most of the movie was meant to feel that way. Dunst's portrayal of the character comes across as a girlish person prone to inner thinking and whimsical consumption. This may be true, I do not know, but it leaves us with little view inside the only character in the movie.It's not all terrible there are some good shots, some comedic moments and towards the end of the movie, there is a nice touch where part of the story is told through the changing of a painting, which I found clever. It is not enough though and as the revolution in France is beginning, the movie is coming to an end. The revolution does hint that the movie may end with some drama. Alas it does not and it more peters out than anything else. I felt cheated of my time. If you love fancy dresses then maybe there's enough here to keep you ooh-ing and aah-ing but if, like myself, that is not enough to keep you interested then I suggest 'Dangerous Liasons' as a great movie covering a similar period within France.",3,4,9,14 November 2006
Madagascar," Nice and simple
","I actually missed the first couple of minutes of this but picked up the story well enough anyway. Animals from New York zoo, due to a zebra wishing to broaden his horizons, end up on the island of Madagascar. They're obviously new to the wild and must discover themselves and find out who and what they are, which is also what the native lemurs are wondering as they regard the new arrivals with an eye to their own problems. Needless to say, adventure ensues and the audience is taken for a good ride. The use of colour is excellent with bright and vibrant primary colours to the fore. This bold presentation grabs even children's attentions. All the animals are well voiced and there are no truly scary scenes like, say, The Lion King. While the main characters bring the story along the surprise stars of the show are, for me, the barely-used penguins who get all the best lines. Not as good as Shrek or Toy Story (1 & 2), but I enjoyed it more than say The Incredibles or Finding Nemo. Great all round family movie with plenty for the grown-ups as well as the kids.",7,1,2,11 July 2005
Crash," Crashed at the end
","What a good movie! Notice the use of good rather than great. I was really enjoying this one. There was a broad range of characters played by a more than able cast of varying experience and backgrounds. There were some great moments of dialogue, tension, humour and emotion where the audience were held at the edge of their seats, wondering if this time tragedy would strike. There was an intricate web of a storyline, weaving strands of interconnectivity to each thread of this tale of racism in LA and delicately pulling it all together. Alas it was in the drawing together of these tales that the film went wrong for me. Elements that had more emotional impact seemed to be finalized first, leaving more trivial, less weighty aspects to the very, very end which meant I was leaving the cinema not feeling very much about the whole thing rather than leaving with stronger feelings. It seemed to blow its load prematurely and a little reordering at the end would have made this a better movie for me. Despite this fudging, it's still one of the best movies in theatres at the moment and if you miss it there, do make a point of seeing it on DVD/TV.",8,0,2,5 September 2005
The Aviator," What a turkey
","What happened at the Oscars? Why should the man behind this get Best Director. Apart from a couple of flight scenes, this movie was painful to watch. The main actors (DiCaprio and Blanchett) were completely miscast in their roles. There is little story to speak of. There's no background to base Hughes' life on when the movie begins, no depth or realism to his grittier, seedier side and no bite or grip taken on his madness. Instead we get a bird's eye view, gently floating over the mostly trivial aspects of his life. I learned nothing from this movie. I was not wowed by any special effects. I did not gasp at any beautiful cinematography. I did not revel in the absolute immersion of an actor in his character. I did not feel that I had to go out and buy the soundtrack, though this might be because I already have 'The Cat's Meow' soundtrack which shares some of the tunes and certainly the spirit and, by the by, is a far superior movie in my estimation. I will never get the time that I spent watching this back. Scrocese has made some good movies and some great movies but this idea, unlike it's protagonist, does not fly!",3,3,6,18 July 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Scores a 7 ... just
","I actually did laugh out loud a couple of times when I went to see this in the cinema, which can be pretty rare for me. The title's pretty self explanatory so no need for any plot summaries but suffice to say, you'll get almost what you expect. For me this movie was a bit over hyped. I can see that the score for this movie is coming down a bit recently from where it was and due to the timing, can only suspect that this has a little to do with US humour vs. rest of the world humour. Also, it must be noted that leading man Carrell is the main character in the US version of 'The Office' which may (or may not) be lending extra weight to his role here and indeed be contributing to jokes which non-US viewers may not get. The movie, as I say, has its funny moments but these tend to be toward the start rather than nearer the end. Like most comedies, it loses its bite half way through and ends up concentrating more on the emotions and relationships rather than purely on the laughs. I found the ending to this to be especially weak and failed to see the relevance of the 'musical element', unless the makers were trying to be kooky, which never really works when one tries too hard. Not bad but, due to being about 10-15 minutes overlong because of the repetition of some jokes, not as great as I'd hoped.",7,1,2,15 September 2005
The Machinist," What was the point of making this movie?
","I'll start with the positive. The movie looks good with the faded color lending weight to our protagonist's jaded view of the world. The performances were also applaudable.However, what was the point of making this movie? (Here comes the spoiler, if you can even call it that!!) From the moment where Ivan first disappears from view and is not recognised by co-workers in the factory, I started to say to myself 'Please, not another alter-ego/split-personality story. Fight Club's done this already and done it rather well!' Alas, my fears were eventually realised but I remained optimistic, hopeful that maybe something imaginative might be done after the denouement. Once again I was disappointed.This is a simplistic, boring story. It's a pity, as it's the best acting that I've seen Christian Bale do and the films palette is strangely appealing but if you want my advice, keep your money for something else!",5,39,67,1 April 2005
Batman Begins," Just missed ...
","It took some time for this movie to get going. Did I mention that it took some time for this movie to get going? Almost as long as it's taking this comment in fact. I suppose that one could put this slow build-up of tension, character and background down to an exposition which would ultimately pay off later in the franchise but even later in the movie, there are many slack and dull times.I truly wonder are Christian Bale's choices in movies. The Machinist in which he recently appeared was very stylistic, again a comic book world and Bale's performance was fine but all in all the plot lacked a core essence and the same is unfortunately true here. Although not an avid comic fan, I am sure that this will have been the most realistic and satisfying big-screen incarnation of the Caped Crusader. Certainly elements in the movie captured that unreal reality, mostly those involving the hallucinogenic drug sequences. Bale is fine in the role but the story could have been sharper and tighter.Support comes from Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes. Again, their performances can't be faulted but there was severe under-use of Neeson's and Murphy's characters. They were almost passing shadows, barely at the forefront of things, which is something that I find unusual in a superhero-type movie. Yes, some of the tension of the movie was supposed to be Bruce Wayne's own internal struggle with himself and his morals, compassion and sense of justice. In the end though the right balance for this versus his external enemies is not reached and the movie ends up in an unstable equilibrium in which few can be comfortable. Holmes' character is practically pointless, merely a foil for some ideas, a hint of love interest and a plot device, which is clumsily used in her awkward final scene.I was looking forward to this movie and really enjoyed parts of it but the sum of those parts does not good a movie make and so in the end Batman Begins just ends up being better than average. Hopefully the inevitable sequel will deal more with issues that are communicated to the audience because in this movie Bruce Wayne was too good at keeping it all to himself and leaving the audience with little to chew on. Disappointing!",6,1,3,30 June 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," More like a choking factory
","It's been years since I've seen the original movie and yet still I remember enjoying it and of course the 'oompa loom-pa' song. The same cannot be said of this remake. I was intrigued upon hearing that this would be a darker Willy Wonka but Depp's performance here seems unusually off the mark. All the Michael Jackson-isms aside (intentional or not), the character seems never to be really understanding his own malevolence and so comes across as more innocently dangerous than dark and plotting! The songs in the movie are terrible and forgettable with the exception of the puppets' performance of 'Willy Wonka' prior to everyone's entry into the factory on their tour. The cast do well enough with what's given but rather like 'Attack of The Clones', it does seem that everyone got sick of looking at blue screen sets. Some nice kaleidoscopic set-pieces do little to offset the general feeling of boredom that comes on after the first 20-25 minutes or so of the movie, which are actually okay. In the end, I was happy to get my bum off the seat and walking again. If I am ever to watch a version of this movie again, I shall be opting for the older, brighter and altogether more enjoyable version!",5,0,1,3 August 2005
Green Street Hooligans," Worse than a nil-all draw
","There is nothing right in this movie. An American journalism student who has been kicked out of Harvard because he was framed by his roommate comes to London to visit his sister who is now married and has a child there. Very, very, very shortly after arriving he is sent away for the day to a soccer match with Sam, brother-in-law to the American's sister. Sam's patently a hardcore soccer fan who doesn't particularly want to bring a yank to the match with his mates. After a jokingly pathetic attempt to stand up to Sam and his yobbish behaviour (and attempted mugging), Sam suddenly finds a respect for the American. This quick turn was the beginning of the end. What follows is an even more unbelievable saga of bad London accents, shaky fight scenes scared of being too explicit, and pathetic, moronic and loutish behaviour (well I suppose it is a football-hooligan movie). The protagonist learns to fight with great ease against seasoned street fighters despite never having being in a fight in his life. Loyalties seem to flip at a moment's notice and characters behave in ways which make no sense at all, such as a mother who abhors violence and wishes to leave London because of it driving her infant child into practically the most violent gang fight that there could be, stopping the vehicle and getting out of it, with him still strapped inside! The audience are supposed to feel some sort of connection to the song 'I'm forever blowing bubbles', the anthem of West Ham (the featured team) but it comes across as a drink inspired wail of oblivion, which is where this movie made me want to go. Avoid, avoid, avoid!!",4,0,0,15 September 2005
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A New Entry In My All-Time Top 10 Worst Movies Ever
","Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! Granted the good word I had heard about this movie had indeed come from those who would at least sympathise with the Republican movement but, to be honest, I was nonetheless looking forward to seeing this movie which was to be a no-nonsense film shot in the very county in Ireland in which I grew up. I was wide of the mark in my ignorant optimism and how dull was the resulting pain in my head after viewing this.When one sees a movie such as, say, 'The Dukes of Hazzard', one enters the cinema with expectations set rather low and is thus rarely disappointed. 'The Wind That Shakes The Barley' had presented itself as something more and the bar had been raised appropriately. It merely a pity that, to me, the bar was to be vaulted over and not, as this movie excelled at doing, limbo-danced under.The acting, directing, cinematography, script, editing, sound and plot were all poor, albeit with a few exceptions in the acting department. I do however get the feeling that some actors were directed to stutter their lines in an effort to make the dialogue seem more real but this only resulted in the poor lines jarring even further. In fairness to the actors, there were no characters to work with in this effort, only stereotypes.Some points of note: - the amateur camera-work when panning left and right and up and down and left and up and down and right when the main house of the movie is set on fire - the primary school-like debate on the issues in an office - the main character moaning how he had tried to avoid getting involved in the war but couldn't and then tried to get out but couldn't. Rubbish! His friend was killed but he was to leave for London. What stopped him was seeing a train driver get a bit duffed up for refusing to carry soldiers! He made zero attempt to leave the war - none! - the simplified version of events around the shelling of Republicans in Dublin's Four Courts was almost funny.I hope I never have to watch this movie again and not because of its harrowing drama, which is sadly lacking, but because it was one of those movies where I almost walked out for the first time. To shoot a movie in a beautiful area, such as West Cork, and for none of it to come through on-screen is truly a remarkable feat. How this won a prize in Cannes is anyone's guess. The wind may shake the barley but, for my money, all it's doing here is blowing tumbleweed through this ghost-town of a movie.",2,16,35,2 August 2006
The Descent," Shocks in the Dark
","I'm glad I went to this without really knowing anything at all about it. It begins in a gentle way until the main characters life becomes completely and suddenly unravelled. Cut to the future and we see her and her friends united together to go explore a cave system in the Appelachian mountains. What begins as a journey of discovery and team work descends to a journey of survival and self-preservation. The claustrophobic possibilities of caving are captured pretty well in this movie and certainly the camera angles must have been pretty hard to work out. There are shocks aplenty here and gore comes as a more than hefty side-salad. The characters are barely more than two dimensional and their decision making and rashness within the confines of the caves leaves a lot to be desired at times; in fact it borders on the laughable to see people running full speed around a cave with no protective headgear on - I'll say no more. However flaws aside, this is still a good ride. The use of women as the thrill-seeking risk takers makes a change from the muscle bound 'jocks' that we're used to and indeed later on leads to the questioning of the validity of tighter emotional bonding between women while also exploring and exploiting the exposure of women to predators in the dark. This is something that probably plays on very real fears for women in the audience but I can only speculate. As a man, I quite enjoyed it. It's sharp, shocking and packs a punch that keeps you rolling from the start of the action to the pointed finish. I tried caving once and enjoyed it. If you fancy trying it, it's probably best to try it before you watch this movie!",8,1,3,11 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Bore Of The Worlds
","Following on from 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind' and 'E.T.', Spielberg once again casts working class America against other-worldly beings. This time however there are no tender moments shared over M&Ms or sweetness and light in the mother-ship. These are some hard, tough creatures who have had the technology and knowledge to plot against us for quite some time. Quite why they were plotting against us or regarding our planet with envy was never explained but worse than that, which was also unexplained, was why such an obviously advanced civilisation did not heed the basic quarantine/bio-hazard rules that we puny humans follow when we go to new environments. Perhaps viruses never evolved on their home-world, I don't know but it was an unconvincing and sudden ending to a movie which was only held together by its special effects and the outstanding performance of Dakota Fanning. I need day no more about her. It was almost painful to see Tim Robbins sink to his character in this movie; a shell-shocked lunatic with a shotgun and penchant for violence which would desperately worsen his situation rather than better it. Tom himself is of course on 'Cruise' control (sorry, couldn't help myself) and there are plenty of 'running' scenes (a la opening of Vanilla Sky) - something which seem compulsory for his movies these days, always with the running! The movie started well and built up tension but once the aliens exposed their machinery, we entered into a series of set pieces with the main characters constantly just escaping (by millimeters in some places) their deaths at the hands of the invaders. The fact that they consistently escaped while all others around them seemed to perish became very tiresome and unconvincing and the 'Lazarus'-type return from the dead of the son at the end was ridiculous and unnecessary and, at least for me, took away any little bit of consequence that the movie had. Even Morgan Freeman's voice-over seems bizarre in this. Worth seeing once on the big screen for all the flashy lights and explosions. Go with low expectations though! An empty, disappointing movie.",6,1,3,7 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," A few laughs, but not many
","Welcome to one view of the world of the 30-something single male. Always on the look-out for the next available girl, partying like you're 21 again and so on. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play two guys living just like this, crashing weddings with fake back stories and having one hell of a time until, at the wedding of the powerful government Secretary (played by Christopher Walkin), one falls in love with the Secretary's daughter and the other has a fling with his other daughter and thinks her certifiable! Needless to say, much buffoonery and attempts at merriment ensue. Mostly, I found myself barely sniggering but there are a few memorable moments. The one-on-one scene between the Secretary's odd son and Vince Vaughn is one where I laughed out loud and some of the best moments are when Owen Wilson goes to meet the original Wedding Crasher, called Chaz, played by the show stealing Will Ferrell. Walkin is sadly under used which is a real shame as good use of his character could have added more to the uneven comedy. The two main girls look good and carry off their roles quite well but Vaughn and Wilson seem, despite their hell-raising roles, to be on cruise control and subdued. Overall, if you're after laughs you'll get a couple here but don't expect your sides to split!",6,0,2,17 August 2005
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Nonsense
","Yet another big screen adaptation of a comic. There must be few franchises left to sell off at this stage. How and ever, this one follows on the heels of the recent Batman Begins, which was an inward looking, pensive and insubstantial work. Fantastic Four on the other hand gives you exactly what you expect; a big, bright movie for your money. Critics have been hard on this movie and so maybe I Dido't expect enough going in to the show. Bar an inexplicable scene where Storm goes naked and invisible on a bridge for a reason that I seemed to miss, I can find little to complain about. Okay, so the humour's not hilarious and the plot's predictable enough but for someone who knows nothing of the comic book, this was a summer blockbuster that didn't leave me feeling deflated! No Oscars I'd say but passes the time amiably!",7,0,1,3 August 2005
Sin City," Escape To Another Place
","The strength and power of this movie lie in it's depiction of unreality. A comic book world is perfectly created here along with a comic book atmosphere. Everything here is mega-cool, melodramatic and ultra violent, all with the safe distance of fantasy. The men are blatantly macho with only the evil characters being unnecessarily rough, lacking in a moral motive for their actions. The women are sharp of tongue, tough as nails and sexy as hell! The intermittent use of colour that is used to emphasise or draw attention to something also works well and gives Sin City one of the most original styles seen on screen. Three stories are told here and while they don't really have much to do with each other, bar their setting in Sin City, the movie still fits together. It's probably a little over-long but generally it rolls along well and there's a good few laughs, even if half of them are at some poor stool getting his posterior royally kicked. Well worth seeing but just short of perfect!",8,0,1,15 June 2005
The Martian," Well-made but vaguely disappointing and flat with no emotional engagement
","Hmmm, it wasn't THAT good. It's well made and Damon probably saves it from utter failure but despite all the 'science' there are many contrivances, conveniences and plot holes. Characters are depressingly flat (she's the computer nerd that keeps a hex chart on her PC, he's the chemist that can do Heisenberg-type feats with kitchen ingredients, she's the tight-laced mission commander with a secret passion for disco music, sigh, he's the Nasa bigwig who just sees the numbers, he's the genius loner doing the hard math and lives off only coffee, sigh, you get the picture) and dialogue is trying too hard to be clever and snappy. The dynamics of the team on the mission are too perfect to be really believable and, for me, all the buddy-buddy, black-and-white, suits vs astronauts stuff is so by the numbers that it really annoyed. The structure of the plot is very procedural and it seems that Watney only needed to encounter each kind of problem once - when he had it solved then it never happened again despite all the equipment on Mars getting older and older and ... but I digress. There was also one too many scenes in which someone had a brainwave in relation to a problem and then walks away mumbling to themselves while someone else follows them saying 'What? What? What did you think of?'. In the end, I didn't care what happened to anyone. The movie didn't engage me in that way - sure it was interesting and nice to look at but it main message is that science shall save you if you work it. Science may be the new religion but fanaticism to anything is a blinding and dangerous thing. There are some people at whom this film is perfectly targeted but for many more this will be a good-looking and distracting work with little real satisfaction. I'd still give it 6/10 and on a good day when my disappointment abates I might up that to a 7/10 at best!",6,8,78,1 October 2015
V for Vendetta," Did I see the same version as everyone else?
","Wow! As a lot of the comments I am seeing for this movie are very positive, I am just wondering if I have seen the same version, or cut, of the movie as everyone else seemingly has. I cannot see how this was enjoyed, as a whole, by anyone. Yes, there may have been certain scenes which certain people may have enjoyed but overall, there's little to be impressed with. The exploding buildings were fine but very reminiscent of Independence Day in that some of them just weren't real enough. The script was, well, poor (the alliterative sequence aside - alas, this too was overdone). The characters were bare types and I don't think anyone had to use much of their acting powers in orders to portray them. John Hurt barking out from a screen being a prime example. V's and Evey's relationship, such as it appeared to blossom from nowhere ('Oh you've tortured me and kept me as a prisoner, let me kiss you!), was unconvincing. The story didn't have much content either and the movie ran far too long. You found yourself waiting to see what the point of it all was and in the end discovered that there was little point at all. The only value that the movie has for me is that, perhaps, it is an attempt to bring to mainstream America the ideas and concepts of fear that have been used by US government to oppress the people of the US, to start and continue wars, to remove and ignore human rights, to add new 'big-brother' style laws and to make the rich and powerful richer and yet more powerful, as Mr. Noam Chomsky's been saying for years. I know not of the comic from which this hails but I would say that unless you're a fan of same, do not bother going!",5,15,30,10 April 2006
The Island," Typical Summer Fare
","Yes, this is typical summer fare and typical Michael Bay movie-making. You know what you're going to get; big explosions, beautiful people, chases, spectacular bits of scenery flying all over the place and the girl and the boy getting together in the end. This is a tale of clones being produced by a facility who find out that the lottery prize which they all want to win is a poison chalice. They escape and the hunt for them begins. Cue all manner of mayhem from train wheels to big rocket bikes. The acting is fine as there's not really a whole lot needed. Steve Buscemi makes a welcome appearance but alas not for too long. There's not much time to take a breath here and it all rolls along predictably enough to the inevitable climax and over-the-top final scene, where something more subtle would have worked better (but that's not a word that's in this director's vocabulary). A blockbusting movie that does quite bust the blocks but does at least leave them dented.",6,0,0,15 August 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not Ferrell's best work
","Disappointed is probably the best word to sum up how I feel about this movie. Having already sat through the appalling Disney/Pixar vehicle, 'Cars', earlier in the year, I was looking forward to an altogether better movie based around motor racing this time around. The trailer was good and much of Ferrell's other work has had me on the floor laughing. Alas, it was not to be and at 108 minutes, this film's about 25 minutes too long for what it has to offer. Of course, much of it has been ad-libbed (you can see the actors almost about to laugh at what's going on in several scenes) but I felt it strange that some of the funniest material, both in the trailer and in the end credits, did not make it into the movie itself, which certainly could've done with them. It's not that you won't laugh at what is there, it's just that what is there is a little thin on the ground and interspersed with scenes and shots that are too long and lingering to help the comedy but which also do not sit well in a movie with a tone as obviously farcical as this one's. Some of the jokes also rely too heavily on, how do I say this, conservative sensitivities and, while funny the first time, do feel jaded after a few airings. Ferrell and Reilly do reasonably well, even if their catchphrase is overdone by the end, but Sascha Baron-Cohen never really fits properly into his part. It's hard to put a finger on it but it's probably down to the character not being his own creation: he's not sitting in his own skin so to speak. I'm sure that the Borat movie will make amends for this. Let's hope that that's not yet another disappointment. As for Talladega Nights, well, it's probably best watched with your mates on TV/DVD after you've all had a few beers.",5,0,2,25 September 2006
