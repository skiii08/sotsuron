The Avengers," Comic Book Heroes
","This movie is meant for those 8 and up. It is also meant for those who like SciFi Fantasy. The Avengers, a group of single comic book heroes, get together to save the world from Lokki. Samuel Jackson, the head of the Earth's protective forces, plays his role well. The characters are shallow, but let's face it, it's comic book time. It is fast paced and contains interesting toys and gadgets. It works as a great party movie. I loved the sets, the colors, and the characters, all in one film. Thor even comes to the rescue. All in all, the movie is very entertaining and is well worth its greater than 2 hour booty killer time. Get a bowl of pop corn and a group of friends, turn this movie into a SciFi party. I give it 5 thumbs up.",5,9,18,7 April 2013
Fight Club," Lackluster Movie
","This movie seems geared for the male over 13 crowd. It has quite a bit of violence in the money Others may think it makes statements. It does. It seems anti establishment. I can get that listening to my son as his teenage years fly by. I don't believe that it has much, if any, redemptive value. We all at some time want to rebel against the world. We all want to knock someone off their block. However, most of us don't and we learn to accept the world and rules of the world. I was surprised to see Brad Pitt in this movie. I guess we all need part time work somewhere and at sometime. This film has a very small amount of entertaining value. Use your time wiser, watch something else.",2,0,4,5 April 2013
12 Angry Men," Many talented actors
","12 Angry men is a film in which maybe those over 25 would enjoy. It explores prejudices and preconceived notions which people had in the 1950s. Actors such as Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, and Ed Begley give good performances and make their characters believable. Without these good performances, it could have been a boring movie with meaningless discussions in the jury room and in the court room. These talented actors bring life to the movies. The movie could edit out 5-10 minutes. It is a classic so it warrants watching. Otherwise, a bit slow. The movie had a predictable outcome.Watch it alone for the performance of it best actor, Henry Fonda.",4,2,14,5 April 2013
Insomnia," Al Pacino and Robin Williams, are very good in this movie.
","Insomnia is a movie for those 18 and older who enjoy mystery/thriller movies. The movie is a good film for late at night when you can devote some 'alone' time to the movie or possibly when you are eating dinner by yourself. The actors, Al Pacino and Robin Williams, are very good in this movie. The rest of the cast are okay. Once the film is over and one has had a good night's sleep, the movie is easily forgotten in the long scheme of movies. The pace of the film is a bit slow. The movie does eventually draw you into the action as well as emotionally into support of the character played by Al Pacino. This is a movie to watch with a glass of wine to savor both the beverage and the movie.",3,1,4,12 February 2014
Elf," Christmas season fun
","This film is for those 8 and up. Elf makes a good Christmas season film. The film works well in January too in the winter weather. Elf will put a smile on your face. Will Ferrell makes a funny human elf. Bob Newhart makes a cute papa elf. The film can even make a good background movie while decorating the house for Christmas. It is a light hearted film and should entertain the whole family. String popcorn, eat popcorn, and make merry while watching this film. Buddy Elf tries so hard to fit into his new human family. It doesn't matter who you are, we are at least once in our lives, the new kid on the block. We learn to fit in and we desire acceptance and affection. For about an hour and 40 minutes the film will entertain you. Four thumbs up.",4,2,5,7 April 2013
Pacific Rim," the story gets old fast.
","Pacific Rim is a movie best enjoyed by fans of Science Fiction and action packed movies. The movie best reminds me of those rock 'em,, sock 'em video games -- monsters and robots. The movie is colorful and holds your attention. However, to me, the story gets old fast. I really don't think that there were any acting challenges, except for the wildly creative monsters and their movements. The monsters remind me of the ever-ready battery commercials -- they keep coming and coming and don't stop. Overkill is the act of the day. This movie is great for a party or having a bunch of friends get together. I give it three thumbs up for its colorful action.",3,1,1,2 May 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Al Capone, the new Godfather
","Al Capone gives a whole different interpretation as the new Godfather. A good adult film to enjoy. Approximated the perfect length. With Al Capone we all learn the lesson which his father taught him. 'My father taught me many things. Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer' It seems that even the Xfiles used this lesson. Robert Duvall as the family lawyer becomes the 'family legal lion.' In this movie, the fictional history of Al Capone's father's rise as a mafioso is depicted. With this film and its predecessor, The Godfather, we are taught that crime does pay. In fact, it pays well for those who are very smart, very cunning, very rich, and very powerful -- otherwise you die. The music is similar to that of the Godfather. Where Marlon Brando was more of a loving man, Al Capone's godfather portrayal is one of of rigid ruthlessness. However, the ruthlessness is necessary for survival of the family's power.",7,0,6,5 April 2013
Oblivion," The film is carried by Tom Cruise.
","Oblivion is a film which would appeal to those 14 and older and for those who are Science fiction fans. The film is carried by Tom Cruise. He is the film. The film's pace is very slow. In fact, it takes 45 minutes to an hour before any real action begins to take place. The film reminded me of the strategy in Independence Day whereby the alien ship was destroyed from within except that in this one, the deliverers of the bomb don't make it out. This is a prime time movie. It is not really a family film, although young teens and older might also enjoy the film. Younger children might get confused with all the clones running around. Bring the popcorn and break out the soda for this film. Enjoy.",4,0,2,3 March 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Love that JR Tolkien
","This movie is geared to the adventurer in all of us. Those who are 7 and older and like to fantasize about different worlds here on earth will enjoy this movie. We are introduced to not only to hobbit land, but also to magical elf land. We meet Frodo and Sam, the heroes of the Lord of the Rings. However, in this version we believe that Sam is more of an annoyance than an ultimate hero. We meet the saviors of men from evil who become the fellowship of the ring with Gandalf as the guide, but not the conqueror. While reading the book, I had no idea how the scene with Gandalf and the mountain terror could ever make it on the big screen. However, it was good. The ending of the movie was like the beginning of another adventure, one which I could not hardly wait for the next in the series of Lord Of The Rings film. This movie is wondrously entertaining and truly a joy to watch.",7,0,0,6 April 2013
Dark City," Good SciFi/Fantasy
","I recommend this film for those over 12. The young teens won't understand much of it they will go in for the neat lighting effects, the scenery, the fast pace of the film, and the comic book like script. I watched this movie because 1) I am a SciFi fan and 2) Keifer Sutherland was in this film. This film sort of reminds me of the movie, The Matrix. The movie keeps you interested and wondering what was coming around the corner next. The lighting in the film gives it a somewhat surrealistic feel. The actors work well together and make one believe that we are back in the 1930s/40s. William Hurt also does a good job acting. Although the film could be used in teenage parties, it is a film which will keep the audience quiet and glued to their seats eating popcorn. It will keep you entertained for its run. I give it 5 thumbs out of 10, memorable, but not a classic.",5,0,4,7 April 2013
Gone with the Wind," Shines brightly through the ages
","Gone with the Wind is appropriate for those 12 and up. If I could have given the movie a 20 out of 10, I would. 1939 was a golden year for movies with both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. Color scenes in Gone with the Wind were hand painted movie frames. The era of royalty and nobility in America gave way after the Civil War to democracy and freedom. Yet, dreams still exist. The number 1 and number 3 movie phrases of all time are in this movie. I for one have used both. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are both so good in this film that if all the other characters messed up, they alone would carry the movie. Leslie Howard depicts the nobility and royalty of the South, who, when the war was lost, he too was lost. Clark Gable portrays the ultimate survivor and realist. Vivien Leigh plays a character who is in love with the dream, yet has to become a survivor at great personal cost and learning too late what is truly important to her. The director leaves out one-half of the book. Yet, he produces a wonderful, classic movie. If it weren't for the intermission, the movie would be too long. Everybody should see this movie at least once. I think I have seen this movie more than a dozen times. I fall in love with this movie with each and every showing. Great romantic movie. It was a great day for movie lovers when Margeret Mitchell was on the train and met a book publisher. Gone With The Wind is a story which will shine brightly through the ages.",10,11,16,6 April 2013
The Little Mermaid," The musical numbers in this movie are very good
","The Little Mermaid is a great family movie that the younger children will get a kick out of -- even mom and dad might enjoy it too. The musical numbers in this movie are very good, including my favorite song 'Under the Sea.' Even the villainess has a good number to sing and perform. Romantics will get a kick out of the movie as well. The colorful underwater scenes are fabulous to watch, a real treat for the eye. The little mermaid herself has a stunning voice. The underwater creatures are adorable to watch and each presents unique personalities. My son had me read him the story several times until he was about 6 years old. So go ahead and pop some popcorn and get everyone a soda or a glass of milk for some good old fashioned musical and family entertainment.",5,4,10,11 December 2013
Schindler's List," Memorable film of Jewish oppression during WWII
","This film is for those older than 16. It is not a chic flick nor a family film. It is a thought provoking film dealing with the Jewish oppression in WWII. The film captures your attention and holds it throughout the film. The actors Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley and Ralph Fiennes do give a stellar performance. However, it is the supporting cast which makes the film work. I would have rated it higher if the film could have stayed within my 2 hour bottom limit. Although a memorable film and a film which deals with such a politically charged subject, I feel that I was not so entertained as I was educated, even though it is a work of fiction. Not a film for those wanting entertainment. It is a thought provoking film that all should watch at some time.",4,0,6,5 April 2013
Donnie Brasco," The plot and pace of the film move along at a good pace.
",Donnie Brasco is a film principally geared for those who are 16 years old and older. It is very entertaining. The plot and pace of the film move along at a good pace. Both Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are good in this film. The other actors/actresses interplay well. The film is a good prime time film. Donnie Brasco requires more attention than what a group of viewers who want to party and talk may want to provide. It is not a family film. There is some thought provoking scenes and topics which are in this film. It is a good film in which to enjoy popcorn or even a glass of wine or cup of hot tea. The film is not supposed to be realistic rather than thought provoking and entertaining. Enjoy.,4,1,11,5 January 2014
The Dark Knight," Batman thriller
","This movie works well for the under 30 crowd and over 8 crowd. It is a highly dramatic movie. I loved the dramatic colors, music and scenery. The acting was so-so. None of the characters are believable, but after all, it is Batman. The characters have to be bigger than life and the music has to be overdone. It is a great 'guy' flick or teenage 'girl night' flick as it involves little thinking -- just go with the flow. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman always provide good supporting role acting. The movie is sheer entertainment and acting should not be taken seriously. There is lots of action, the the vivid color makes the movie. Enjoy the tale of Batman and his crime fighting spree.",4,1,4,5 April 2013
Pulp Fiction," Lots of good actors/actresses
","This is a movie for the18+ crowd. This is a serious popcorn cruncher movie. John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, and Vhing Rhames all make this film worth watching. Typical and predictable plot. I enjoy performances from Bruce Willis and Vhing Rhames. Males may like this film better that females. A good 'guy get together' film. Although John Travolta is not one of my favorite actors, he gives a somewhat believable performance for his character. Because John Travolta is one of the main characters, I rated it down. John Travolta plays a character that is too slick to be believable. It was Bruce Willis, Vhing Rhames, and Uma Thurman who help save this film. This movie is about 20 minutes too long. It could have had tighter editing.",2,2,6,5 April 2013
Jack Reacher," You don't want to miss a single line nor piece of action in this movie.
","This movie is geared for those who are 14 and older, preferably those who enjoy action thrillers/mysteries. Jack Reacher is comfortably watched either on a rainy afternoon or an early evening movie, with lots of popcorn ready. You don't want to miss a single line nor piece of action in this movie. I don't know the Reacher books so I can't evaluate the movie as to how close it is to the book. However, the story has lots of twists and turns in it. It sort of reminded me of the Hammett movies in which Bogart starred as the detective and the Maltese Falcon. To me, Tom Cruise was very believable. Rosamund Pike was good and reminded me of Kathleen Turner. Even the end was a bit surprising. The movie kept me guessing most of the time and totally held my attention. Both men and women should enjoy the movie -- eye candy for both sexes.",5,0,2,20 November 2013
All Quiet on the Western Front," it is a masterpiece of a movie.
","All Quiet On the Western Front is a movie that most 'Doves' over the age of 30 will appreciate. Most 'Hawks' may not'. I am a Hawk. I enjoy war movies that show the 'good guys' winning and the action on many war films. However, it is a masterpiece of a movie. This is a movie that basically shows the senselessness of war. The movie was an international hit. Lew Ayes initially tried out for a bit part for this film and the director saw him perfect for the lead. He got it and was instantly a star. This is not a prime time movie. It is a movie that demands your attention and thoughts. The movie is very depressing. The pace of the movie is deliberately slow. No popcorn here. This movie is for thinking, not relaxing.",6,2,5,25 February 2014
Dark Shadows," True Love wins in this Dark Shadows
","This movie is for those 13 and older. This Dark Shadows shares little with the Dark Shadows of the late 1960s/early 1970s except for the names of the characters. Yes, Barnabas is still a vampire and Angelique a witch. With its overly dramatic acting and dark picturesque scenes, this movie comes off more like a comic book. Not the say the interpretation is bad, it is just very different (no werewolf in the original Dark Shadows in the original family). The interpretation is so different that many who grew up with Jonathan Frid as Barnabas may feel a bit cheated. Jonathan Frid's character tried to hide his monster from his family, this Barnabas does not hide his monster. Who cares if the characters are shallow or that the script is not that good. It is a comic book rendition of Dark Shadows.For what it is, it works. This is a popcorn popper and a cruncher at the end. You gotta love the sets and the addition of Alice Cooper. I give it five thumbs up.",5,0,1,8 April 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Love Morgan Freeman
","A very good movie. It is possible that the men (adult males) will find this movie more appealing than women (adult females). Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give very good performances. In particular, Morgan Freeman excels like he seems to always do in his movies. I can never get used to the type of character that Morgan Freeman plays because of his versatility of roles he has played. The movie, although not fast paced, draws you in and keeps you interested. I could have sat through an additional 20-30 more minutes of film. However, the movie appears to be of sufficient length. Quite to my surprise, the ending was not entirely predictable. Older children (10+ years) would also enjoy this movie. This is not a chick flick so boys don't bring your date to this one. OK to share with long term girlfriend or wife though. This move does not inspire romance nor was its intent. A good film to sit down with popcorn.",5,0,0,5 April 2013
Taken 2," There is a lot of killing and chasing in the movie.
","Taken 2 is for those who are 13 and older and like to watch fast paced action/spy movies. The movie moves at a fast clip and holds your attention throughout. Taken 2 is a good prime time movie to be watched either alone or with friends. There is a lot of killing and chasing in the movie. Although the killing is done in several different ways, it is not gory. I did enjoy the chase scenes. Liam Neeson does make a good spy character. This is a good movie for pizza instead of popcorn as you will want to do your eating before the film. You will enthralled with the film to eat during its showing, once it gets going. Get your buddies together and enjoy the film.",5,0,0,18 December 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Powerful film
","The movie is for those older than 9 years old. This movie forms a powerful conclusion to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. The cast is truly outstanding. The scenes are epic in dimension. To me, it seems as though almost the entire fellowship of the ring become heroes in this chapter. Although it is a standalone movie, it is the conclusion to the other two Lord of the Rings' movies. I have read the books several times and the movies does do justice to the story. Although Frodo is the ultimate hero, to me, it is Sam (Frodo's friend) who inspires me. The movie demonstrates that it takes more than one or two heroes to defeat evil, it takes the teamwork of all who have a vested interest in goodness, loyalty, and honor. It takes courage and the steadfastness to see a task through. This movie presents a glorious ending to Frodo's task to rid the world of the evil wizard and his hold on power. The movie also shows that however good and courageous are the hearts of men, they can in the end lose faith and falter. However, it is the team that wins and one heart is not enough to turn the fates of men to lose. Way, way thumbs up.",9,0,1,5 April 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars does it again
","This film is for SciFi fans. The film is for everyone 7 and older who love SciFi. The film has plenty of action to keep you in your seats. Luke Skywalker undergoes both Jedi training and we see his character develop from the rash young man he was in Star Wars IV. We also begin to see a hint into Darth Vader. I fell in love with Yoda in this movie. All the main characters from Star Wars IV are here. However, it is Luke and Yoda who steal the show. However, the movie did make me feel like I was between episodes and want more. I also felt that it really didn't have a true ending, just a closing of a chapter. However, it is very enjoyable and keeps the Star Wars saga going. Not only do I want more, a continuing story; but I want a beginning. Little did I know that all I had to do was wait a few years. If your are a Star Wars fan, be sure to include this one in your collection.",6,6,10,6 April 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Just another Transformer movie
","This movie would be enjoyed by those 8 and up. Truthfully, since I have seen the other Transformer movies, I find them to be the same. After watching one, the second one was no different and neither is this. They are still entertaining. Yet, I find them all alike. I do like watching them because (1) I love SciFi and (2) it moves (colorful scenes and fast action). I love all the techy toys in all the Transformers movie. I like the comic book feel of the movie. The actors do their job -- none are memorable. Transformers is a rock 'em, sock'em movie to expect more would not be fair. Get charged up to save the world again. I give this movie four thumbs up.",4,1,4,8 April 2013
The Godfather," Marlon Brando totally believable
","Excellent adult move. Love the music. I could have watched this all day long. Perfect length, if anything too short. Marlon Brando really defines the role of an Italian mafioso patriarch. I permanently learned the phrase, 'make them an offer they can't refuse.' Al Pacino gives another brilliant performance as the son who get drawn into his father's business, bit by bit. Then, Al Pacino becomes his father to continue his work. Al Pacino's character becomes even more ruthless a godfather than Marlon Brando. Robert Duvall, the family lawyer, gives a brilliant performance as one who at first comes off like a lamb but is really a lion in disguise. Diane Keaton plays a predictable character but gives an OK performance. The musical score is memorable. Just thinking about the movie brings to mind the musical score second to the character, the Godfather played by Marlon Brando. So powerful!",8,1,4,5 April 2013
