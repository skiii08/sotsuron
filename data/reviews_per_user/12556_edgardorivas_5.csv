50 First Dates," Hidden Masterpiece
","I didn't know about this film till my uncle introduce it to me 10 years later. I didn't know what to expect. After watching it I was just shocked how awesome this movie was. Its a comedy with a very nice story to go with it. The jokes are crude and slapstick which is awesome. Rob Schneider's character made me laugh so much as well as Sandler. I was surprised I never heard of this movie back then but not long after watching it, I had to own it. I can't imagine anyone hating on this film. Barrymore and Sandler are great actors with amazing roles in this movie. Its just laid back fun which no one should miss out on. Enjoy this Hidden Masterpiece!",10,1,1,30 November 2016
Aquaman," Very Cliché Movie
","First in for most I really didn't want to see this movie but friends invited me along and I thought why not everyone is raving about it. It opens up with a decent story about Altlanta who is discovered by a lighthouse keeper and they have a hybrid kid, Aquaman. Story goes from there to when he's older and eh it begins to fall. From the moment he is adult fighting the pirates in the submarine it's just a cliché of every superhero film you've seen before. Black Manta trying to get revenge on Aquaman to avenge his father, princess of Atlantis helps Aquaman overthrow the king,the two fall in love for having a journey together, Aquaman challenges king for throne and loses(wins later), mother turns out to be alive(even thought she was supposed to be dead), and so many many overused lines like 'I've waited for this moment', and 'They don't need a king, they need something greater, a hero'. Sorry DC but the writing needs huge improvement, it's no wonder marvel has the upper hand. Wonder Woman still remains the only incredible DC film.",2,94,184,28 December 2018
Bird Box," Not Really Scary
","I really didn't know what to expect watching this film. All I knew is it had Sandra Bullock and it was getting popular. So to kill time in the afternoon I decided to give it a try. Now I get scared easy, like pretty easy, last horror film I watch was The Shining(1980) and it gave me nightmares that night(I know pathetic). The movie starts with Sandra Bullock getting an update of her pregnancy at the hospital and all hell breaks loose. The movie does a weird transition from the present moments and story of the very beginning of the apocalypse. Bullock's acting as always nailed it on point, she's very talented at what she does. Everyone else ehh not so much, and even Machine Gun Kelly is in it which is strange in itself(he's not good in the film either). The actual monster is never seen because it's invisable apparently, but you hear it's presence. It has to be the least scariest creature ever. It also ends very abruptly with lots of questions wanting to be answered about the creatures like: why does it turn some people insane to kill others, or why birds aren't affected by the creatures and why does it affect those watching video of it also? Not scary and a lot left to be desired.",6,2,5,10 January 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Not Bad, But the 2005 version is better
","I will not try to spoil any of the movie but I'll try to give you an idea of how its like and how it compares to the 2005 King Kong. The plot is about a scientist getting a military unit to come check out an island which lots of disappearances have occurred. They get there and realized why the disappearances have been happening and try to escape. There were a couple things that bothered me about the film and one of them was character development. The characters names were mentioned once and never again. There should not be a movie were I leave and not know at least one characters name. However Tom Hiddleston's character is very likable and his acting is just real good, as well for Brie Larson. Kong was real awesome he has a lot of action when he's on screen and it makes up for the lack of character development. How does it compare to the 2005 version? Its less dynamic and feels like its dragged a little too long because other than the 2 leads you don't care about anyone else. 05's was very well developed and most characters actually fitted well to plot, while here I think they had to many and very little to say about them. But don't let that stop you from watching the movie its alright but not as good as 2005 Kong.",6,2,5,11 March 2017
Deadpool," Overrated! Over-hyped!
",After hearing everyone raving about how funny and awesome this film was I just had to rent it. And I couldn't be anymore disappointed. The jokes were eh like looking into the camera and trying to crack a joke or hitting someone in the crotch or even taking one up the ass(you know what I mean if you seen it). As a fan of the X-men Film series this Colossus bugged me a lot. His accent was so annoying and his power isn't to stay full on metal the entire time. I did like his other mutant friend she was cliché but was decently funny. I will say Dead Pool's stunts are awesome and that's great but I felt the movie is no where near as good as the other X-men Films yes including The Last Stand but not including the Wolverine Origins. Its okay at best not the best movie of the year but not the worst. Give it a try but have low expectations.,6,16,30,30 November 2016
