Requiem for a Dream," Poor reflection of reality
","I don't understand why the film is getting such high rating on this website. The theme has been dealt with in other movies and better done else where. I simply could not get into the movie.  The scenes were not shot particularly well.  Lastly, many errors and exaggerations in the film, especially about the health care professionals who take care of the mentally illed.  I don't know.  I just don't think that is very responsible of the film makers.",1,8,17,17 April 2003
Se7en," An excuse to be violent...
","The only good part of the movie is trying to find out the identity of the killer.  However, the rest of the film is just all about finding an excuse to put more blood and violence onto the screen.  They never explained why the killer is obsessed with the Seven sins.  And the way they found the killer was 100% laughable (going through a city's public library system and find who borrows a book.  first of all, wouldn't you buy the book instead of borrowing it from the stupid library? secondly, do they realize how many people use that library and borrow books of the same title?').  A pretty empty film, if you ask me.",1,15,41,17 April 2003
Fight Club," Entertaining but not very deep.
","It is a very entertaining film, with all the violence and actions.  The plot is somewhat intriguing as well.  However, I just felt that the film tries too hard to deal with the topic of 'the Unconscious,' and the other half of self.  Yet, it falls very short of developing it as a themem.  In the end, other than chewing on some popcorns, I got nothing out of that movie.",1,6,24,17 April 2003
