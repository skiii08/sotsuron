The Blair Witch Project," Eerie and psychologically chilling
","If you're looking to see a trite, banal approach to the horror genre then you are aiming at the wrong film. This movie is chilling and disturbing, especially toward it's climax. The characters progress from ambitious, if not over-confident  filmmakers into scared, hunted animals. This progression is one of the main points in the film since we get to view it in full detail. The scares are not of the 'jump-out-at-you' variety but are more haunting since you must think about the film to really understand it's terrifying uniqueness. I would encourage anyone to go see this movie because it is so full of originality and it is certainly like no horror movie you have ever seen. I agree with most that say the final frame is one that is burned into your mind and stays there for a time after you have viewed the film. Truly a psychological scare in top form.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
American History X," Stunning and emotional
","This movie was very nicely done. I have always thought Edward Norton was a superb actor and this film reaffirmed my beliefs. Norton is very persuasive and intelligent as the young Neo-Nazi leader. The movie is also gritty and shocking and doesn't pull any punches, hence the prison shower scene and the 'curb-stomping' scene. I am not a particular Edward Furlong fan yet he does a nice job as the junior Hitler-in-waiting with readily available smart-a$$ grin. The rest of the supporting cast is good, but it is Norton who shines in a performance that was definitely worthy of his Oscar consideration. This film will make you think and will stir a lot of emotions. It's well worth the money you'll pay to see it.",Null,0,0,8 April 1999
