First Man," Flat out tedious with no need to ever see again
","How can you take the life of one of the most well known men on the planet and the most exciting missions that mankind has ever made and make it so utterly boring?This really was an incredibly tedious snooze fest. Okay Neil might have been a quiet man but did we have to see him be so robotic and boring? What is the film trying to do? Was there ever a desire to, you know, want to entertain the audience?Ths film is about the man and the incredible mission yet we are treated to a flurry of such pretensious chin rubbing shakey cam and 'up the nose' close ups. There are endless silences, long looks into the distances and noisy shakey scenes that have no excitement or emotional weight behind them.Indeed the director is more concerned with reminding you that he and the DP are making this art rather than crafting a story that takes these buffoons out of the picture and showcases the man and the achievements.This grandiose self important train wreck sucked the life and excitement from this whole endeavour. What a terrible and tedious way to honour this planets first ambassador.Watch the documentary - In the shadow of the moon - if you really want to be awed and enthralled by what the Apollo missions achieved. That documentary leaves you feeling elated and amazed whilst this just left me feeling bored and cheated out of the money we paid for ths Blu Ray.",3,3,6,17 March 2019
Skyfall," Wildly over rated, hopelessly inept
","Skyfall might have made a shed load of money but it was laughably bad. The Bond films have got worse since Casino Royale, which was a good first attempt at updating them.QoS was lame and Skyfall was just as bad, if not worse. So clichéd, so all over the place, so riddled with nonsense.I'm constantly amazed that proclaimed fans of Bond could be so easily seduced by the emptiness of Skyfall.Bond the character is great, but the producers aren't interested in making him awesome through the writing or character development but rather by repeatedly telling people that he's cool, placating individuals with some empty loud bangs, ticking fan expected boxes and watering down the brand by selling aftershave.A great example of the films woeful writing and woeful scene setting would be the sex scene with the woman from the casino. She tells Bond that she was sold as a sex slave at 13, which generates sympathy in the audience, and we then cut to a perfunctory and utterly irrelevant sex scene.Why talk about the characters background and then not grasp that the story that you tell might resonate with the audience, making them feel a little uncomfortable and uneasy about Bond exploiting her for a quick shag.But, as I've said before, the makers are now so lazy that they just want to tick the relevant boxes and that ticked the 'sexy Bond girl' box.Personally, I feel for Martin Campbell. They give him Brosnan and Craig as newbies and he bangs in some good first efforts for them to get the franchise rebooted and then they hand it over to a host of pretentious directors (Sam Mendes included) who haven't a clue how to direct action or craft engaging characters.But I guess as long as they tick box A and box B, so that critics and others can blindly proclaim a film/character 'cool' and 'badass' for no discernible reason, then they might as well keep churning out the crap.",4,8,13,27 July 2015
Star Trek," Encouraging but could have been better
","I was a little disappointed to be honest for I'd thought the trailer was excellent and that the films would be a return to the form of the early ones. I thought the characters were well rounded and well played, particularly Kirk and Spock whom I really liked. The supporting cast were also strong.However, I thought the story was unnecessarily confusing with the time travel angle seemingly created just to allow Leonard Nimoy to be in the film, which he didn't need to be. This is a reworking and the characters were strong enough that you didn't need a character from the old series to validate the new one. If they are going for a refresh they need to cut the chord completely.Also the trouble with introducing time travel is that you can't help your mind racing ahead during the film and filling in the time blanks. I mean if the Romulan planet hadn't been destroyed when Nero had come back in time, why didn't he just stop the star from going supernova this time? There were also inconsistencies with how one minute they have the technology to beam aboard a ship travelling at warp speed yet to place one drop of red matter in a planet they have to drill from a platform suspended below the Romulan ship on a rusty chain. Small points I know but Abram's had gone some way to remove the lunacy that was in the Mission Impossible series with elements that were at least more considered or explained.The biggest problems for me though were the continual shaky cam, which I'd hoped directors were growing out of and the regular lens flare. OK it's a cool trick but I think it was overplayed a tad too much. There were times when the screen was virtually all white.Half the wonder of sci fi films is seeing a directors vision of the future but when you can't see a great deal due to being blinded by flare and then having the camera bouncing all over the place, it can become a little frustrating.I also found Michael Giachinno's score really intrusive and ill-placed. He can do computer games and TV programmes but I think he needs a little more polish before being let loose on a film.I know people will say I'm taking it too seriously but each to their own. For me it's just rare that a sci fi film would have great characters but poor action scenes. It's like Iron Man in my mind, great characters and top notch acting but the action scenes and general story a little disappointing.If people want to see sci-fi very well done with cracking characters, a great script and decent battles (both in space and hand to hand) you really need not look any further than the wonderful film, Serenity.",6,0,2,3 June 2010
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Okay but I felt uninvolved
","I saw it last night and was a little disappointed. It just felt uninvolving to me.I had deliberately kept my expectations low but it felt really generic. The K2 character was nowhere near as 'snarky' as I had seen some describe him. Forest Whittaker felt wasted and the destruction scene in Jeddah had that similar Roland Emmerich 2012 'it looks pretty but I'm feeling no tension or any peril'.On the plus side the last third was good when it felt a lot darker and heroes were having their little death montages. I liked the cleverness of pushing the powerless star destroyer into another and the Vader tunnel scene at the end was easily the best thing in the film.Jedi's only ever seem to fight with good intentions so to see him employing his 'trade' so aggressively was a real sight to behold. You could feel the terror of the guys that were trapped in the tunnel with him.Maybe it would be better on a second viewing but the film didn't get my heart racing, it didn't generate an emotional connection and it felt all very tick boxey. There was no laughing in the screening that I saw and I think only one or two moments (powerless destroyer and rampaging Vader) that made me turn to my friends with a wow.Maybe I'm expecting too much, maybe I've seen too many films but for all the talent that Disney's money could buy I had hoped for something a little more.",6,8,16,22 December 2016
Captain Marvel," An embarrassing, cheesy, cliché ridden mess
","Well what do you know, even though I've been on IMDB for 17 years and posted the first of 90 reviews back in 2002, it seems that IMDB declined to post my first review of Captain Marvel.How strange, I wonder if it was because I mentioned that the lead actor had made a job of using identity politics to promote this movie and hence I had to address it to indemnify myself from accusations of being a sexist? Let's see if they deem this review worthy or pull it because their masters don't want to see negative reviews of such a 'right on' film.There is nothing subtle or good natured in Captain Marvel. The messaging is in your face and slapped on with a heavy wet mop. The script is a mess where you could see that the multiple writers were struggling to write anything funny but just couldn't. The agenda was constantly there with laughable attempts to put down guys, with them either offering douche lines like 'it's called a cockpit', demoralising 'you can't do it' advice from Carol's father (because of course all fathers want to limit their daughters ambition!) or flat out sexism like when Fury is scanned and the response is 'Human male - no threat at all'. It was laugh out loud for its blatant motive.The action scenes were a lot of noise and insanely quick cuts, primarily to mask that Brie can't actually do many, if any, of the stunts. She even struggles to run with any form of class or elan. Take a look at Civil War and Infinity War and you can clearly see the action. You know what is going on, you can grasp the geography of the scene and you can see the actor in frame pulling off most of the action. That is why people make a big deal about Tom Cruise doing a lot of his action scenes. The more you can see your star in the scene, the more you connect with a scene.Not so with Brie, although saying this, it is very hard to actually connect to Brie, when her facial moves are so limited and her character is so weakly written. I mean consider Star Lord, who has a similar 'taken from Earth' story. How rich of a character is he compared to Carol?But of course, this is the difference. Starlord is just a man and nothing special and hence his character has to be well written to get you to like and connect with him. With the agenda being driven so hard in this film, you HAVE TO like Carol's character, simply because she is a woman and hence no elements of originality or engagement need to be added to her character. Like her or be branded a sexist.So the lead portrayal is bland and boring and the script, written by a minimum of six credited writers, is confusing, lacking in direction and crammed full of tiresome social justice commentary. The action scenes are a mess and the perceived bad guy has a bewildering choice of accent that sounds shockingly bad. There is no real mention of Carol's parents or family because I guess they are irrelevant. Instead we concentrate on her girl power friendship, which again makes no mention of the daughter's father, but instead has a cookie cutter child that seemingly used to wear Carol's old flying jacket even though it would have completely dwarfed her.By the final action scenes Carol is revealed to be so powerful that there is literally no tension in her poorly constructed fight scenes. Why is she engaging in hand to hand combat when she can shoot blasts from her fists? Her powers are so all-consuming and so encompassing that they can either be used to fly through a spaceship, kick-start a smashed and downed craft (how does an energy blast do that) or mean that she doesn't even have to worry about the triviality of breathing in space. She has become such an all-powerful being that Ronan, upon seeing the ease with which she destroys his weapons, identifies her as a woman (surely he would have just called her a human rather than being able to identify her gender from afar) rather than a weapon.And as for the cat, good lord, how utterly ridiculous. As if it's not bad enough that it renders hard-nosed Nick Fury into a weak arsed 'coochie coochie' fool, it also conveniently turns into a space Octopus monster that swallows the Tesseract and tears out his eyeball for no apparent reason. The utter stupidity of the film manifesting itself in a scene where Nick has permanently lost the vision in one eye but is still happy to continue washing the dishes while having a banal heart to heart with Danvers.If you need more evidence of just how lame this is compared to other Marvel films, just compare the differences in acting and drama in the mid credits scene where Mar-vel makes an appearance. There is more going on in that one scene than this entire film.This film really is poor. Thor: The Dark World was tedious, GOTG 2 just too much CGI and a third act that dragged on for too long and Ultron collapsed under its own weight and expectations (I mention this to help give the reader a flavour of what I do and don't like in the MCU). But this, this is a grade A stinker. Writers that can't write, directors that can't direct and actors that can't act. An unholy triumvirate that delivers the worst Marvel film, yet one that was deliberately shoehorned in front of Endgame to cash in on the cliff hanger of Infinity War.Now this could all be a simple wrong move from Marvel but I fear this could be the start of a rocky descent into SJW pleasing but real fan frustrating movies. Fingers crossed that I am wrong.I must add one final comment to counter that it is such a 'popular' film. I went and saw this on Thursday 14th March at a large local multiplex cinema. I saw a 10.00pm performance, literally one week after the film came out and there were 12 people in the auditorium. Now I'd seen some pics of empty theatres but thought that maybe they were taken 30 minutes before curtain up but this was amazing. A week after it had come out, with the media reporting it was a blockbuster smash doing great business and there were no more than 12 people in a 10:00pm performance. It's almost like there is some kind of co-ordinated campaign to misinform, like I don't know, pulling reviews that don't sing the company line...",3,21,35,17 March 2019
Zootopia," The preachy virtue signalling became too hard to swallow
","So I enjoyed the film. The action, some of the characters and the invention of the makers was really good.However, I did begin to feel the nausea of preachy moralising becoming a little too hard to swallow or rather overtaking the film about half way through.Yes, it's good to embolden children and individuals that they can be what they want to be but it shouldn't be at the behest of others. I've no problems with women being in the army and on the front line but they should be able to do exactly the same as what a man can.Bending the rules or turning a blind to physical inadequacies are fine in the classroom but get to the front line when someone is incapable of physically carrying a fellow wounded soldier or lugging that ammo crate around and your well meaning positive discrimination leads to a less than effective fighting force.Even so I was cool with Hopps getting through the selection (albeit off the literal backs of others) though I started to feel the embrace of political correctness when the front desk guy was remonstrated for calling her cute (with it's less than subtle nod to the n word).Okay, that's still fine as the world we are being presented with in the film is fun and entertaining. The sloths are hilarious and it's all bright and shiny.But half way through the messaging that we are wrong to judge people and the moral posturing began to get a little overwhelming. Yes, a utopia of rivers of chocolate and laughing children and never needing to lock your front door is all very nice but it seemed to be preaching that anyone who didn't think this utopia was achievable was evil or in some way morally corrupt.It didn't seem to be a case of acting on what's right in your heart, tempered with your head, but acting on what the liberal intelligentsia are telling you is right. Having stomached so many 'informed' people preaching that voting for Brexit was because I was a racist thicko, I find it hard to ignore when I feel the air of posturing creeping into the narrative.I've seen many reviews acknowledging what the film is about but that it's subtle and non preachy. I certainly didn't feel that. Maybe I'm more sensitive to it but I didn't go into the film being aware of the moralising that was in it and hence what I felt was an organic reaction to the film rather than having any preconceived ideas.A fun film that made me laugh in the first half/two thirds but one where the lasting impression was that I'd just been lectured/preached to.",5,7,17,17 February 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Tedious and uninvolving
","This is such a bland boring exercise.I cannot fathom how the writing team of Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof still manage to get writing jobs because they have little to no talent.Everything is so telegraphed and lazy and boring and generic.The script is going through the motions in the blandest of manners with the hope that the visuals pull it through. But unfortunately, despite the endless lens flares, it doesn't.I really have to questions how Abrams can't see that he is directing trash and hence I hold him responsible for how poor the film is.So many things that one could criticise: the endless repetition (can you beam him up, no but I can beam someone down - this phrase was repeated twice in the last 15 minutes), why bring old Spock back when he references a different Khan than the one we are seeing - what is the point rather than really lame attempt to be cool, the tiresome space chase through the structures with the oh so familiar 'we're not going to fit' line.I'm sorry but this film really is generic, tedious pap and I despair for the how Star Wars might turn out with this 'resting on his laurels' director taking the reins.",4,3,6,24 January 2015
Green Room," Over rated nonsense
","I cannot understand some of the other reviews on here for this film.The front cover describes the film as 'a shot of adrenaline from start to finish'. I can only assume the author of that quote has never been excited in their life.The film was slow paced, the characters unrelatable and unlikeable, the action scenes felt like they been shot in someone's bedroom with sound effects to match, the claimed 'gore and violence' was pretty tame and there was little or no tension.The idea that this was some kind of Carpenter-esque thriller couldn't be further from the truth. The bad guys would repeatedly send in 1 or 2 people at a time that meant there wasn't really a sense of real peril or terror.Mark Kermode said this was worth checking out but his stock has certainly dipped now. It just really felt like the kind of film put together by some pretentious chin rubbers who think they know what tension and violence is but ultimately don't have a clue.The kind of people that would look down their nose at other more mainstream films yet think their poorly constructed and uninvolving movie was the height of art and edge of the seat excitement.Believe me you'll get more reward stumbling upon a gem on Netflix than making the same mistake I did and buying this.Utterly woeful.",3,26,60,15 October 2016
Suicide Squad," It's just a mess
","Wow, that really was an utter mess.It reminds me of what friends and the big bang theory became. Short 20 second clips that offer a nugget of not a great deal before bouncing on to something else.Like the film had been constructed ready made to cherry pick a trailer from but unfortunately they chose literally all the best bits for the trailer hence there was nothing new for the film.The Harley scene with the lift was a classic example of this. Utterly pointless, meaningless fight, chance to play another 'cool' track and then walks out with everyone giving her the clichéd amazed look.I really wanted to give the film a chance but it was so uninvolving and the characters so unengaging. They weren't written with any verve or intelligence, just the barest most generic collection that you could of.None of them were really bad (as in being labelled the worst of the worst), just a little naughty.The fights felt empty and nothing more than a darkened jumble of motion, loud crashes and whatever piece of music they had commissioned and rammed in to make it all feel really cool.And as for the ending, we had the usual swirly lights and overwhelming destructive power that can amazingly be destroyed with a few well placed grenades.I can't believe I'm saying it but I think B vs S held my attention more and that was shocking.Utterly woeful effort.",4,2,5,13 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The trailers ruined the first viewing but it's grown into one of my favourite Marvel films.
","I really like Cap, enjoyed the first film and love the genesis of his character. Weedy guy who doesn't like bullies. There are scenes in the first film (that we watched before hitting the cinema for this) that make me genuinely smile or utter 'go on Steve'.To that end I'd been really looking forward to the sequel, especially after I felt he was underused in the Avengers (particularly his deleted scene) and seemed to play second fiddle to Stark, Banner and Black Widow.After first seeing this film, I really didn't like. So many of the cool scenes and twists in the film had been ruined by trailers that showed way too many iconic moments (the betrayal in the lift, the crashing of the heli-carriers) to the point that they actually ruined my experience.But over the years I have come to appreciate what a wonderful action film it is. Cap gets a chance to develop, Black Widow becomes more likeable and the action scenes have resonance.The final fight between Cap and Buck and the music when Cap falls into the water is a beautiful, wonderful scene. Even the end credit sequence with the stark colours is just breathtaking.A really good film that expands on what was shown in The First Avenger and continues the development of my favourite character into an even better film in Civil War.Great work from the Russo's and the two writers.",9,21,42,31 March 2014
Rocky II," My favourite Rocky film
","God I love this film. The best rocky in my opinion and such a great sequel. It starts exactly where the first one ends. Grabs the audience, as a sequel should, by showing again the fight from Rocky I and then developing the characters further. Whether Apollo frustrated by only just winning, Rocky and Adrian as they marry and have a child or Mickey spending that time with Rocky in the chapel. The tenderness between R and A is just wonderful. Unlike some directors they just keep the romance simple and I just love the innocence of their relationship. Him a lowly boxer, she a dour shop girl but they love each other and that's all the need. The training sequences are brilliant, making you wanting to punch the air when they've finished. The fight is great, unrealistic maybe but exciting nonetheless. My favourite scene though is right at the end. Everyone slates it but it always brings a genuine tear to my eye. He's beaten Apollo and achieved his dreams but the only thing important to him is showing this to his wife. The emotion of his 'Yo Adrian, I did it' is just wonderful, like a young boy wanting to show off to his mother. Rocky has been through hell but all he wants is his wife to be proud of him. Mesmerising and touching.",10,1,1,19 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Dreadful, laughable, oh dear !
","***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** AOTC was just dreadful. I loved the first three Star Wars, grew up with them, had a crush on Leia, even loved the Imperial march music with the 20th century fox film montage that you would get at the beginning of all the videos so i went in looking forward to it. Watched the Phantom Menance at the pictures and found it laughable and clumsy but thought hey as crap as it was, bar Darth Maul, let's give it a go and waited for AOTC. Oh dear, oh dear how can people who love film possibly defend this nonsense. The dialogue is as clunky as hell. Instead of trying to show us that Anakin still loves Amidala through acting and character development Lucas thinks 'Oh no, I haven't got time for that lets just get him to say it on the way up in the elevator. Bish bosh, job done, we can get on with the next chessy action scene. The emotion and sincerety in the love story is pathetic. As much as I wanted it to work it was just cheese city.****  SPOILERS  ****Lucas's attempts to explain Anakin's inner torment over his mother where equally tortuous. If he cared about her so much why didn't he do anything earlier ? in fact why was he so happy to leave her in the arms of slavery back in Phantom. Surely Liam Neeson could have sorted something being an all powerful jedi. But no Anakin arrives after six weeks of her being tortured and just as he rescues her she dies. Lucas still might have saved it if he had used this opportunity to show Anakin's rage ( and maybe a little depth of character) when wiping out the village but no this was lost so we were left with a confusing plot, hilarious factory production line set piece that looked like it belonged in Sonic the Hedgehog or Crash Bandicoot, Yoda bouncing around like Kermit on speed, the virtual extermination of the jedi intercut with annoying and unfunny C3PO titbits which just killed any sense of real tension and some of the most dodgy, cheesy, 'flash gordon like' fade in and fade outs between scenes that I have ever seen.****  SPOILERS END  ****
The legacy of Star Wars has been ruined by Lucas's greed and one can only hope that he realises before the third one that although a great visionary he is a p*** poor director and should pass it on to someone else pronto. One also wonders if everyone who raves about it so much want it so desperately to be good that they will stomach any old tosh that is served up.  Shame on George for turning out this rubbish and shame on his fans for massaging his ego and letting him think that what he's doing is any good.",3,0,1,20 November 2002
Ant-Man," A solid, enjoyable and entertaining film
","I have to say that I enjoyed the film.Maybe my expectations were a little lower going in than they had been for Ultron and hence I wasn't therefore disappointed. It felt like a perfect counterpoint to Ultron's over crammed roster and bombastic filled to the gunnels approach.It was smaller, it was more intimate and it was more fun. Rudd, Douglas and Pena were great to see and I enjoyed their interactions. The scenes with Falcon were good and I like the angle of Ant man potentially being the fly in the ointment and being slightly off the grid of the Avengers.It sat nicely in the MCU and I liked the fact that Pym was a little dismissive of the Avengers. I think a bit of rivalry or ego between inventors has a useful place.I agree that the bad guy felt a little underdeveloped though I respected the makers showing him turning people and animals into gloop before he perfected his technique. The romance angle felt a bit tenuous and I think I would have preferred if they hadn't gone down that angle.There were less action scenes than a normal Marvel film but this then gave them more weight when they did happen and I really enjoyed the going big and going small transitions. I really liked the fight in a briefcase and the one in Cassie's room.Even though the going sub atomic scene had been telegraphed, I still enjoyed how he was punching his way through the layers of the Hornets suit as he shrank giving him a particularly unpleasant death. Him getting out of the sub atomic zone was also nicely handled with using the previously established 'make big' discs.I concede that the film wasn't the greatest but it was more satisfying than Ultron and better than Thor 2. The character is intriguing and as playing a real every man (Falcon does have military training) I'm really interested in seeing how he interacts with other members of the Avengers and future Marvel films.A solid effort 7.5 out of 10.",7,3,12,22 July 2015
Justice League," An embarrassing and lazy mess of a film
","Wow, I went in with very low expectations but this really was shockingly bad. Everything from blatant exposition from random characters at the beginning, through to ridiculous poster style shots whenever they get the chance - it was just bad.The CGI on Steppenwolf was cringe worthy and genuinely felt like he wasn't there, the opening action scenes to re-establish the characters were ridiculous, the script had no spark or energy in it and everyone (including the director and writer) just seemed to be sleep walking through the whole production.Their lazy arrogance that having a number of characters on the screen is all that you need is just amazing. Have these people learnt nothing from MoS, BvS or SS? I wasn't expecting great things but I thought it might have some good set pieces but I was genuinely stumbling around trying to see or hear something that was genuinely cool or entertaining.Cavill still can't act for **** - apart from the one scene as Superman where he was asked what he likes about Earth. Unfortunately you never find out in what was probably the most memorable scene of the film. Affleck looks bored and unengaged, Miller tries too hard, Mamoa isn't given any decent material and Gadot is reduced to a series of embarrassing bottom or cleavage shots.And really, the mother boxes. What kind of dumb ass name is that? And as for the Lois Lane monologue at end, I couldn't stop laughing at how overly dramatic and self important it was.You really do have to laugh at DC and Warner, their execs seem like the most moronic fools around. They make an okay film in WW and don't study that to try to understand what was right with it. No, just barrel on with pretty pictures and literally nothing else.Their contempt for their audience and their lack of effort or creativity is staggering. I'm astonished to say that I think this is even worse than BvS. What a real stinker.",3,4,9,20 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," This really is something special
","Let me start by saying that I've never read the books. During my childhood I belonged to the legion that read the works of Tolkien's friend and rival, C S Lewis and the Narnia Chronicles.  They got my imaginative juices flowing and I stepped over Tolkien's work.  The films came out and I had been aware of Peter Jackson's work but with all the furore and lack of money at the time I held back from seeing it for at least two months. Eventually I watched it, enjoyed it but it didn't set me on fire.  My favourite scene, Boromir's last stand, lingered in my mind and over time the desire to see it again grew.  The DVD came out and I looked forward to sitting down with my to brother (who had not seen it) to watch again. Wow ! 2nd time around this thing blew my mind.  Whether it was because I then knew the story and could enjoy the characters and appreciate everything else I don't know but it just rocked my world.  I was like a love sick pup with a constant smile on my face enjoying every scene.  I tell you this tale to qualify my praise and make clear that I wasn't a tolkien fan from the start.Peter Jackson has opened my eyes to this world.  I don't know how faithful he's been (and I don't really care) but you can tell from the passion involved and the love heaped on this film that he takes it seriously and is not out to make a fast hollywood buck.  I purchased the normal DVD and recently got the extended version which is even more fantastic. I don't feel cheated and owning both is worth every penny.  The film itself is great.  The characters are rich and full, well written and well acted.  I can't really say I have a favourite but Gimli definetly comes out better in the extended version and I am looking forward to seeing his developing friendship with the others and his painfully sweet adoration of Galadriel.  The relationship between Boromir and Aragorn is very well played, again displaying real depth and makes Boromir's sacrifice and Aragorn's renewed faith in man all the more powerful.  In fact the film deals with the whole range of human emotions and knowing that they will be developed even more over the course of the next two films just warms your heart. The action scenes are great and with real time invested in the characters you feel all the more tense and involved.  The world Jackson has created is lush and wonderful with special effects serving and enhancing but NOT dominating the story.  The musical score is perfection, complimenting the film at every turn.  Indeed my favourite scene with Boromir owes much of it's brilliance to the beautiful music that accompanies it.  I am wrapped up in this world and although desperate to see the next two am also slowly savouring the whole heady experience.  For those that haven't got it I cannot recommend the extended version enough, it takes what you love and just adds more.In summary this film is a joy to watch and Peter Jackson's direction and story telling is assured and confident.  For the first time ever I'm preparing myself to enter a theatre and observe two films without any thoughts of whether I could have done it better.  I have total confidence in Peter to deliver what I need to see and knowing his cast & crew's passion for the project I know they will deliver.  It took me time to appreciate this beauty and elevate it to my favourite all time film but sometimes you have to step back and look again to observe real genius.",9,2,2,21 November 2002
Man of Steel," Such a disappointment given the promising trailer
","I was so jacked up for Man of Steel before it came out.The trailer created this intriguing vision of a film exploring how Superman would cope in a world of short sound bites, Twitter and low attention span.How would the public deal with him when he made the 'right' decisions rather than the 'popular' ones and whether there would be an endless crusade to get him to have a Facebook page.How would he find his place and bother to actually care for a race that on the surface can seem pretty damn selfish.How would he deal with a surrogate family who were desperate to keep him secret and protected, especially following the accusatory tone from the woman in the trailer 'my son was on that bus'.Unfortunately, we didn't get that film. Just a mess of bits from the trailer (practically all of Costner's comments in the film where in the trailer), characters you didn't really care about despite how much you wanted to, hollow writing, a horribly forced and unconvincing romance, characters that are supposed to die but end up hanging around so much you don't feel they have passed away and a tiresome, bombastic and consequence free action scenes.The action just had no meaning as in the fights neither character seemed to get an advantage from all the wanton destruction. It was like you hit me with a train, I'll smack you with a building but there was no feeling that you were wearing the other person down or gaining the upper hand.I like action as much as the next person but there has to be a reason behind it other than it looking cool or because special effects now mean it can be done.The buildings falling down had as much resonance as the destruction in the latter Transformers films and that's why people criticised the film. It's not because they don't understand it, it's not because they can't see the bigger picture which some arrogantly claim to do, it's simply because they didn't feel anything.The World Engine was a classic example of the 'excess' of the film? There was no tension, there was no high stakes. He might have dodged some swirling tentacles but it was shot by the numbers and we all knew that nothing would happen, hence it was just pointless, expensive noise that further anaesthetised you to the action that would come.I like Snyder. Dawn of the Dead and Watchmen are cracking films but this was just a very poor film.",3,1,3,15 July 2015
Trouble with the Curve," Cliched, tedious and boring
","What a snooze fest this is. It has so many tiresomely predictable cliches that it holds no surprises.Clint is gruff and Amy is 'misunderstood'. She has to contend with a partner convincing her of the need to go exclusive but doesn't know that she likes baseball (not much of a relationship there), a male rival who naturally has to be shown to be a fool.The negative male stereotypes continue when this headstrong woman hustles a guy at the pool table and naturally he tries to force himself on her because that's how all men respond to confident women.By this point, we've gone through all of the tired ABC's of hard working misunderstood woman and you realise that Clint, Amy and Justin are so cardboard cutout in nature that you don't need to see any more to work out where they will end up and that you don't like them or care about what happens.A lazy, boring waste of 60 minutes that I spent watching this.",3,0,1,11 September 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," For once, the critics and the positive reviews were correct
","I'd been intrigued by this film and my interest encouraged by all of the positive reviews and word of mouth but I've disappointed a lot recently (Endgame being the biggest disappointment) and I feared that this would go the same way.I guess I was sceptical of the glowing reviews that maybe it was because it was a newer, more diverse Spiderman and hence, like Capt Marvel, people weren't saying that it was good because it was well made but rather that you had to like the film because of the agenda behind it.And so, with some trepidation and expectation of disappointment, I bought the Blu ray. What a relief for my fears to be unfounded. It's a brilliant animated Spiderman film.The animation is out of this world impressive. It's new, it's inventive and it feels fresh. Miles is a genuinely likeable character and hence that is all you see rather than some kind of 'tap you on the head' agenda promotion. His interactions with his family are deep and well written and I certainly was made to care about them.The invention also extends to the other characters and whilst there is plenty of humour from them, you don't feel the makers are trying to deliberately ridicule them to state a message.Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience to watch and I am certainly looking forward to watching it again and checking out the special features.",7,0,0,18 August 2019
Inside Out," Lots of invention, lots of ideas but not enough direction
","I like Pixar films and sat down to this not knowing a huge amount about it.I had an inkling of the basics having seen one of the very early trailers but I hadn't fully immersed myself in all the footage. This meant that I went in reasonably fresh and waiting to be entertained.Granted the concept was fresh, granted there was plenty of invention but it was like they threw them in a tombola and spilled them out into the film without any judicious selectivity.I remember watching the making of featurette for Big Hero 6 and they were discussing how Pixar don't really storyboard a film preferring it to have an organic growth. Now sometimes that can work but for Inside Out it certainly didn't.It just felt like it was made by a large group of people throwing great ideas into the pot but no one then sifting through them to see how they worked in the film. It lacked a firm director to weed out and discard some of these ideas and concentrate on the forward drive of the film.It needed someone to temper the proceedings so Joy didn't dominate the film so much. It needed someone to keep the film bouncing along without slowing down for the next great idea.I was genuinely surprised to find myself bored halfway through and having to give contemplation to leaving when my GF suggested it. As it was I carried on but my attention wasn't held and my wonder wasn't awed.So yes, plenty of clever ideas but not enough focus or momentum.",4,19,54,27 July 2015
Avengers: Endgame," The writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product.
","I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it.",4,1250,2282,4 May 2019
Batman Begins," Starts well with intelligence and invention but then descends
","It had some original stuff that displayed intelligence and thought with regards to his suit, car and weaponry. It did try to dwell on Bruce a lot more and convey some of his darkness but I found towards the end it became very Hollywood-ised. Sometimes filmmakers try to over complicate things and this was a good example.I don't know why they can't have a simple bad guy with a simple plan, why do they have to be so elaborate a plot leaving a growing feeling of inevitability that by the end there will be some big explosions, building destruction, lots of flashing lights and Batman will prevail.The inability of seeing the fighting was immensely frustrating. I don't think I saw him actually land a single punch. It seems a fight scene would be imminent and the makers would speed up the camera, ramp up the bass on the sound, scatter the scene with crunching thuds and smacks but then forget to actually choreograph a fight. Maybe believing that if we heard the thuds and saw some activity on the screen that the audience would imagine the rest and think 'wow, what a scene'. I'd much rather have two or three clearly thrown punches or kicks than 1-2 minutes of whirling cape, bangs and crashes and people falling to the ground.It's a shame that they re-launch the franchise in a blaze of 'this is going to be darker and different' which it certainly starts off doing before descending a little bit into Hollywood banality. Why not have the courage to really shake things up, have the bravery to maybe end it badly (taking T3's lead) or just not conform to the normal formula.Showed promise, had some clever stuff and made more of an effort than some in the franchise but still nothing to rival Batman:Mask of the Phantasm as the best batman ever made in my opinion.",6,46,81,21 June 2005
Avengers: Infinity War," Way to go Marvel, way to go The Russo Brothers
","Major spoilers ahead
.

.

Seriously, I discuss everything about the film without a concern for spoilers.
.
.
.
.
Yes, I really enjoyed it. It was so well crafted and it was wonderful to see the directors working with characters that are already established and hence have resonance and weight behind them. This being shown in something as small as Bruce needing a hug from Tony, which caught him by surprise or Rocket telling Bucky that he wanted his arm on the battlefield.The film just didn't let up, from the high drama at the beginning with the people from Ragnarok having been all but annihilated, to Hulk being trounced which clearly caused him to have some anxiety issues later (certainly the first time that he's been bested in a film) and then the death of Loki. I began to get worried come Thor 2 that Loki was taking over the franchise but Ragnarok firmly put Thor back in the picture and made me like Loki more because I didn't feel he was always getting the advantage over Thor.And talking of Thor, it certainly felt like his film. His interactions with 'the rabbit' and Groot were great yet the makers built in enough peril that I thought he might be killed off when they were making the Storm Breaker ('it's a bit much'). He at last felt like a god where his power could be revelled in without it seeming like he was dominating everyone if you get what I mean. Make him too powerful and everyone else seems too weak. It really is remarkable how Marvel in the space of two films (Ragnarok and Infinity War) have managed to turn round Thor to someone that wasn't as liked to someone who just owns the franchise. Hell, he even manages to outshine Tony.His entrance into the Wakanda battlefield gave me such a high that thinking about it now almost causes me to well up as I feel the rush of excitement. I was quiet in the screening but inside I wanted to jump out of my seat and punch the air. And whilst everyone is rightly terrified of Thanos, here is Thor bellowing 'Bring me Thanos!' - what a badass.I'm a big fan of Cap and hence felt a similar version of the above euphoria when Cap and the crew turned up to rescue Scarlet Witch and Vision. The use of the Avengers theme at that point was so well played. I would have liked more of Cap in the film but I did find a piece from the writers saying that whilst some characters (Cap & Black widow) got less screen time, they would get more so in the next one - which is encouraging.Saying that though I wasn't upset by this. I thought the exchanges between Strange and Stark were great, I was worried that the levity of the Guardians crew might lessen the drama but it didn't. It provided a welcome release but with the death of Gamora showed that they were more than willing to plunge those guys into turmoil. I also thought Thanos was well developed. He believed what he was doing was right. And to some extent you could see the method in his madness and hence relate and understand where he was coming from. He didn't simply want to take over the world and have loads of money. He had a goal, he had a clear vision which made him richer as a character and more fearsome for his single minded determination.So much else to say but I fear that I rambling incoherently now. I loved 'beard' talk between Cap and Thor on the battlefield and thought the end with half of the people disappearing played out so well. Thanos won, he kicked arse and this was the consequence and when Spiderman went, that really caused a lump. It reminded you how brave he is because deep down he isn't even an adult yet, just a kid. You can only imagine what an even greater burden Tony will feel having seen Peter die in his arms.I genuinely can't wait to see the film again and obviously can't wait for the next one in the series. This really is how you do big epics. The recent Star Wars films have really disappointed me for showing film-makers dismissing their core audience for platitudes and PC sound bites but this film truly did deliver. A herculean task bringing a wealth of loved characters together and the writers and directors did an astonishing job. Servicing everyone's requirements, injecting new humour, making you feel tense and real peril for characters rather than it descending into an over indulgent CGI snooze fest. An incredible piece of work and an amazing experience to behold.Way to go Marvel and way to go The Russo brothers.",10,1,4,10 May 2018
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Enjoyable, entertaining fun
","I saw the film last night and really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the first one.Obviously after reading so many other reviews of a weak script etc I must be brain dead but I liked the story and the characters. The four main characters are likable, do actually work together as a proper team and aren't constantly bemoaning their lot in life and the curse of their superpowers.I found the humour entertaining, I loved the scene where Reed stood up to the major and defended his nerdiness. Being freed from the over wrought drama and continual 'damsel in distress' bullshit that fills the spiderman series makes this a considerably more enjoyable experience.I've not read the comics so I can't comment on the Galactus representation issue but as a newbie I found it worked. I also like the issues of sacrifice and bravery that the film used, particularly in the satisfying final action scene.Films, especially comic book ones, are meant to be visually entertaining and it more than delivered on this. Great action sequences, cool characters and good ideas.On a final note what is happening to Stan Lee's ego? Can't he see the damaging impact that his woefully lame and intrusive cameos have on the flow of his movies.www.paynebyname.co,",7,5,10,18 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It was okay but like TFA feels a bit by the numbers
","I got the chance to see it last night at the European premiere.It was a great night (and my first premiere) but it certainly didn't offer me any real emotional satisfaction. Yes, it was entertaining, there were some moments when I gasped out loud at how cool something was or clapped at an action that a character did yet it did feel a little baggy in the middle.There was some rather heavy handed virtue signalling within it where you just felt the creep of being educated/lectured to rather than being entertained. There were also a couple of scenes where the credibility of characters abilities were a little strained.As I said it had some memorable moments but for me it wasn't as mesmerising and raw as Empire or as rewarding as Return.",3,42,89,13 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Wonderous breath of fresh air
","After watching the 'hooked on a feeling' trailer with the 'what a bunch of a-holes' line, I had a feeling that I'd really like this film and abstained from watching any more trailers so that the experience could be as fresh as possible.As the launch date got closer I would read the top line headlines of the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes but not venture further into the body of the review. By the time I was sitting in the chair, waiting for the film to start, my anticipation was definitely peaking and I hoped that it would reward my efforts.Oh how it did.Right off the bat, I was transported into a rich world of characters and a film that wasn't afraid to mix touching scenes with laugh out loud moments. The wonder of the characters and their bickering exchanges, sometimes in the midst of action scenes, was fabulously entertaining and involving.Initially I was concerned that I was being hit with too many characters and would lose track but I understood that the film needed to move along at a pace and was relieved that all the characters were fleshed out enough to make them recognisable and engaging.So many elements made it fun - Star lord's wisecracks, Gamora's fiestiness, Drax's hilarious literalism, Groot's big emotive eyes and Rocket's sense of humour.I thought Lee Pace under a ton of makeup was great as a properly evil bad guy and Michael Rooker, along with many of the other supporting actors, hit his marks to create memorable individuals.The special effects were wonderful but, and this is important, always served the film to visualise the director's vision rather than them be a fall back for a poor story (a la Dawn of the apes).I enjoy the Marvel films but was disappointed with Thor 2 and Cap 2. I felt they become a little formulaic with Thor's over reliance on Loki and the interesting character of Cap being submerged under a tidal wave of empty action scenes.GOTG was a wonderous breath of fresh air. A film that didn't need three films worth of back story to have me engaged but hit me with a plethora of fabulously different characters that I could like and root for from the virtual get go.As an experience, as a jolt of entertainment, I felt this exceeded The Avengers as the final battle had just a bit more weight to it. The film was prepared to kill characters off rather than the rather clone like bad guys of the final Avengers battle. This in turn meant there was more of a threat to the characters and hence you felt more 'on the edge of your seat'.Guardians was a great film and I'm so pleased that Marvel were prepared/brave enough to release James Gunn from the corporate shackles and let him and his script writing partner let themselves go. They've created characters and a universe that I'm desperate to revisit and turned this 42 year old man into a cinema awestruck 9 year old.",9,2,4,3 August 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Entertaining but felt like it had been directed by a committee
","Whilst I enjoyed the film, it didn't feel as much like a Whedon film and more like he was maybe allowed a few minutes here and a few minutes there before he had to return to being on the path that was laid out for him.The film had a very much tick box, direct by committee feel to it.Make sure there are this many new characters, ram in some interaction even if it doesn't feel organic, ensure that we put in irrelevant scenes only to provide links for future films, don't stray from the plan.The mid credits scene only re-enforced this and reminded you that the film you just watched was really nothing more than a filler.There was masses going on and loads of new characters but it just felt that it was going at 100mph and didn't want to stop and smell the roses.I can understand why Joss would want to step away from this for a bit and that maybe the slightly more easily manipulated Russo brothers could take the reins for A:IW 1 & 2.They demonstrated that they can direct action scenes that fulfil the 'wouldn't it be cool if we...' but then when trapped in a story telling dead end just go with a hole in the ground get out of jail card.The film was entertaining, there was plenty of cool tech on display and it was certainly worth the price of admission. However, I don't think (in my opinion) that it was better than the first Avengers or Guardians.",6,4,12,26 April 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Great opening 30 minutes but then fades
","I thought the first 30 minutes or so we're amazing. The script was banging out line after line and the chemistry between them all was fabulous. I even turned to my partner and commented how good the script was and then it started to head down hill.The team got split up, the momentum slowed down and it felt like it couldn't really recapture the earlier mojo. It struggled to re- engage when they got back together but it felt bloated, self indulgent and dragged out.By the time the third act kicked in, some of the chemistry came back but it was lost in an orgy of energy tendrils, crumbling rock and CGI overload. Once one cliff wall has crumbled without a real sense of peril, you kinda feel yourself becoming a little bored.Don't get wrong I love the team but after shining so strongly at the beginning, it felt burnt out by the end which no amount of blue screen FX could repair. The strength of the film is in the team's interactions and I can't help but think they should have been focused on a little more than the obligatory flashes and bangs that had to dominate the last act.One final word about the mix tape. It was over played to the point where you weren't sure if they thought of the scene or the piece of music first. It smacked of 'try hard' with a little of 'what about this cool song that we got the licence to play 15 seconds of'? I did go into the film trying to keep my expectations low but I have to say that ultimately I was disappointed, especially after the really enjoyable opening part.",6,0,4,2 May 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," OK but style over substance
","Revenge of the Sith Umm, I went in with low expectations, thinking that if there can be just one or two really decent scenes then I will be happy. Did it succeed? Some bits are good. It's genuinely darker, yoda has one or two good moments, some of the fight scenes are OK and Hayden Christianson does have more presence. In the 'night of the long knives' scenes I felt some connection, things where going wrong and you felt the drama and Darth getting angry at the end was an impressive display but overall I think it's a classic example of style over substance, selling the sizzle rather than the sausage itself.The battle scenes are un-involving. The droids are totally useless, cannon fodder incapable of shooting anything or anyone and uttering cheesy 'uh oh's', so you don't care for them and knowing the clones are all the same and become storm troopers you don't care for them either hence the battles are devoid of any excitement because you really couldn't care less who wins and to be fair the outcome never seems to have any impact on the story. Plenty of lasers, explosions and spinning ships but in the end it's just bangs and flashes and seems almost irrelevant.R2-D2 seems cool at one moment and the next screaming like a hyperactive child, Sam Jackson corrupts the screen with his presence, you expect him to start shouting and quoting the bible and to be honest isn't good enough an actor to pull it off. You don't feel anything for anakin and padme's relationship. There doesn't seem to be any love or spark between them, although concerned over her future anakin isn't interested in what his loved one says and seems to turn on her remarkably quickly at the end.The lightsaber battles just seem a blur of flashing light, yes they are going fast but so fast you can't actually see any of the moves unlike maybe the scenes in phantom menace or return of the Jedi.What is it with George as well that he feels his audience has zero patience and thus every scene needs to be only 1-2 minutes long before we have another elaborate cut to the next scene and some of these scenes are so unnecessary and seem constructed purely to show off some new monster or cityscape. It's like he doesn't have the confidence in his written material so he has to pad out every scene with endless flash bangs to divert your attention from what is being said. He also doesn't have the confidence in his actors, instead of them trying to act angry or show love the scenes need clunky dialogue to telegraph the message to the youngest viewer. 'Your thoughts betray you young Jedi' my thoughts? Who needs thoughts when every line is so explanatory that it leaves nothing to the imagination or interpretation. The good thing about the first 3 is the arc of the characters, most of them remained and you saw them through the course of the trilogy. In this it seems George needs to create a neatly disposable bad guy for every episode.I don't know maybe the whole reason was to highlight how good chapters 4-6 where but coming out of this all I wanted to do was to watch the other 3 and take more attention of Darth Vader.",3,1,3,20 May 2005
Arrival," Pretty average
","I was disappointed with the film. I'd hoped for something more like Contact rather than ID4 and was prepared to be captivated by something less crash bang wallop but unfortunately the film was just a little too slow and a little too tedious.I liked the set up of the aliens showing up, the gravity in the ship and the complications with the language but the need for some of the countries to attack felt rushed and more as a device to generate some drama rather than being considered.This was none more demonstrated that the soldiers going rogue. I think in the situation shown in the film, the quality of all personnel on the project would be the best that we could offer. The idea that you'd have a bunch of grunts easily seduced by some webcast to effectively mutiny against their own felt way, way off base. Furthermore the lack of repercussion given to the action rather than a cursory 'some guys went mad' line was just odd.Really, some soldiers decided to plant their own device and endanger our interactions with an alien species and it was just pied off with a line of dialogue, just felt lazy and treated the audience with utter contempt. It really felt like 'oh we need some drama and a ticking clock device. It doesn't make much sense but just put it in anyway'.People simply dismissing it as 'people are crazy' is not a good excuse in my mind. That means a director could introduce a random character in any film to carry out a random action and then have it validated by people saying 'oh people are stupid, didn't you know'.For all the praise that the film is getting, it really was just very average in my opinion.",5,5,9,17 February 2017
Black Panther," Ranks alongside IM2, Thor 2 and Ultron as a Marvel misfire
","I like Marvel films and really enjoyed seeing Black Panther in Civi'l War but this origin story for T'Challa was poorly executed.The story was poor, the world building ill conceived (advanced society with thatched huts next to skyscrapers and a feudal king), many of the characters flat out annoying or poorly written and a clear and regularly reinforced race agenda.I mean there is one scene where the token white guy starts talking and he's deliberately drowned out by black characters making monkey sounds (H&M anyone?) because his voice is not worthy because he's white.If there was any other Hollywood film where this example of racism happened, the director would include it to clearly signal to the audience that the perpetrator was a bad guy, a character that would get his comeuppance for being so openly racist. Yet not in this film. In fact he's portrayed as an individual coming to the rescue at the end and his racism simply laughed off. It's like this film was made 50 years ago with its tiresome cheap shots and endless chip on the shoulder rhetoric. It is a weak entry into the MCU and ranks alongside IM2, Thor 2 and Ultron as a Marvel dud.I have concerns about the impact of this film on Infinity War. I do have faith in the Russo's but capitulating to brainless dross to satisfy a rabid politically correct fan base isn't beyond any movie exec. Watching the IW trailer, it does look like they are fighting in Wakanda so are we really going to have to suffer the pinnacle of the last 10 years of MCU coming to a head in an ill conceived El Dorado just to satisfy a bunch of snowflake SJWs who are the last people that were buying into this glorious franchise.Just as the wait comes to an end, just as we top the crest of the hill to see the wonder of IW and it's huge assembled cast, are we really going to have to contend with a big chunk of it played out through the lens of this blatant weak link? Are we going to have to tolerate Cap and Stark playing second fiddle to this kind of nonsense? I can't deny that I'm a little worried.When we have seen what feminism, identity politics and piss poor writing and directing talent can do to Star Wars and a Marvel tentpole, are we not fearful that all of our longing will be dashed on the rocks of a studios needing to signal its moral virtue.",4,4,6,25 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," Simply put - it's wonderfully entertaining
","I'm not a fan of musicals but I went along to see this with my partner and it was wonderful. I was foot tapping at the first song and didn't look back. The songs are great, the set pieces amazing, the characters engaging and the story simple and involving. After seeing the film, I bought the soundtrack and am off to see the sing-a-long version at the weekend.I find how it has played out with critics sneering at it but audiences loving it, a really interesting and revealing indicator of our current lives. Barnum delivered crowd pleasing entertainment but the elites looked at him with contempt and this is no different.And hence I read so many critics who just can't get that people like to be entertained when they go to the cinema and don't always have to be educated, lectured to or instructed about how they should be feeling.We don't need to see a 100% accurate portrayal of a historical figure judged by today's standards, we don't have to see films that need to bang us over the head with a message that needs us to get riled up rather than uplifted and not every film has to be an exercise in virtue signalling that we can brag about to our equally empathetic and 'enlightened' friends.Sometimes we just want to cut loose and enjoy ourselves, sometimes we just want to leave the politics and wailing at the door and simply revel in spectacle and entertainment. That is what The Greatest Showman offers and that is what so many detached critics are failing to see.",8,1,3,16 February 2018
Life," Good quality sci fi horror
","Just got back from seeing this and I have to say that I thought it was a really good film.I see that RT only has it at 65% and it's being made out to be a cheap Alien clone but I think that is doing it a dis-service. I felt it was intelligently made, set characters and situations well and created a palpable sense of tension. Criticism that it's a blatant re-run of Alien are unjustified. Granted, it's about an alien life form in space but that to me is where the similarity ends.Alien isn't the only scary film set in space that is allowed to be made and if Prometheus is anything to go by, Ridley has no right to be the only person allowed to make sci-fi horror films. It captured well the excitement of discovery, the wonder of space and the precariousness of facing any problems up there.The effects were good, you could see what was going on, there was unease and dread and it kept me thoroughly absorbed and entertained. I don't want to elaborate anymore for fear of giving away spoilers but if you like a bit of tension with your sci-fi, it's worth checking out. Try to avoid the critic reviews if you can as I think going in a little blind will help your enjoyment.",8,476,809,24 March 2017
Life," An underrated gem of a film
","I have to say that this is such a good film and it's pretty unfair that it gets so quickly pied off for being an Alien clone. Okay, Alien was a good film but it doesn't mean that no one is allowed to put together their own interpretation does it. Should there only have ever been one Western?What this film is, is a well acted, excellently scored, brilliantly executed example of how to generate real tension. The set up is realistic - our impulsive desire to find life despite the consequences - and the protagonist though horrifying has a genuine motive that propels it through the movie.Having established what it can do, the inevitability of what is going to happen pours off the screen as things go from bad to worse despite the characters best efforts. The film conveys the suffocating claustrophobia of the space station and the idea of being trapped inside with something eminently dangerous and single minded in its desire to survive.Life is an underrated gem of a film. The kind that you discover late one night as a wonderful little treat. It genuinely had me on the edge of my seat. Fabulous tension, amazing production, taut direction and great acting. One of the best tense thrillers that I've seen in a long time.",8,2,5,25 February 2018
Deadpool," Rude, crude and wonderfully entertaining
","I saw it last night and thought it a wonderful, hilarious and entertaining film. So many different and clever humour to laugh at and Deadpool's character was magnetic.I thought the bad guy was very well played and liked that the story was a simple origin/revenge tale rather than some over the top/end of the world/buildings being sucked into the air extravaganza.It meant they concentrated on the characters more and were less worried about achieving the killer money shot for the trailers. Maybe having less budget is not such a hindrance.I loved all the interactions, the romance was wonderfully refreshing and the action top notch. There was laughing and gasping out loud.I really hope the film does well as I've been impressed with Ryan's efforts to get this made, loved the novel marketing and respect the studio's courage to sink some dollar into an r-rated Superhero film. I'd love to see the making of features on this as I think they would be fascinating.I'd put this up with Kick Ass and Kingsman for providing all round adult entertainment.Great work Ryan and Tim, can't wait for a sequel.",8,12,29,13 February 2016
Sin City," I really enjoyed it
","I walked into this film not expecting a great deal. Thought it would be another Kill Bill that was all style and no substance. A film that with so many actors vying for decent screen time would dilute a story into a glorified pantomime.What a great surprise so see a film that is refreshingly adult, cool to look at and has involving stories. I wasn't sure how I would get on with the high contrast comic book look to the film but it actually works. The fact that they set the world, its physics, what does and doesn't work from the beginning means that you have a control for your intelligence to lock onto. For instance someone might get shot 10 times and still be alive which although preposterous to begin with seems normal once you become involved with the film. It also sticks to these guidelines so you don't a get a normal fight one minute and then another where the confines of gravity seem to have been forgotten the next.It's so good to see a film that isn't afraid to be squarely aimed at adults. Women have sex but then are not unrealistically scrambling for the covers to hide their nakedness, the revenge motives are played through to their natural conclusion without characters going soft and the blood is liberally applied to blows and injuries.Mickey Rourke is sensational. I never used to like him as he was quite arrogant in his early days but falling on hard times and forced to do 'straight to video' b movies seemed to provide him with some humility and allows me to appreciate his craft even more. His story is the best of the three. Bruce Willis is also on top form and the rest of the cast deliver very good performances. Clive Owen was a little weak, I don't rate him as that accomplished an actor and for me it showed. But this couldn't dampen the creative flair, the depth of story or sheer brutality of the action. There is plenty of female flesh on show (most of it very nice), a smattering of humour where needed, generous amounts of violence delivered with gusto and crunching sound effects and a good score.Overall I was very impressed. An enjoyable film that was great to look at as well as being involving and rewarding to watch.",8,0,1,9 June 2005
Moon," Fabulous film
","I saw this last night and it was fabulous. It's hard to discuss for fear of giving away any spoilers but I'll try.I thought it a magnificent film and when compared to the bloated, nonsensical 'lets have more pointless explosions' of Transformers 2 it shows that you can still have such thought, style and cleverness in a film for a fraction of the budget.Normally with the independent art-house films they are set on Glaswegian council estates. If remotely sci-fi they are almost forced to have a horror - sex element to help them sell to the teen market.This was so refreshing for demonstrating genuine craft and story telling. A film that even as your mind is racing ahead to predict the typical ABC outcome of film, manages to keep surprising you.There were no silly twists or WTF moments to make up for the writers lack of logic and it offered a subject matter that resonated with you long after.Sam's performance was stellar but it is frustrating that one can't elaborate for fear of giving stuff away. I know the film didn't have a big cinema push, well certainly not in the UK, and was only out to piggy back the anniversary of the lunar landings, but I really hope it gets some more exposure.Sam deserves recognition for his talent as does the writer and director. I've enjoyed some good films this year but that was certainly the freshest, most inventive and well executed one that I've seen so far.",9,20,29,31 July 2009
Alien: Covenant," Lazy writing, moronic characters - just tedious
","I saw it on Friday and I have to say that it was really quite poor. Granted I didn't like Prometheus but I had watched it again before seeing Covenant, read and watched the Prometheus explained articles and videos and sought out that little prologue that they released. I only say this to indicate that I went into the film not with high expectations but with an open mind and an understanding of the film before it.SPOILERSI will be discussing the film so there will be spoilers If Prometheus was confusing and the characters frustrating, here it was a slightly simpler story but the characters flat out stupid. But stupid because the writers just couldn't be arsed to apply a little bit of logic. They like to reference other films in this but it's like none of the colonists have ever seen a scary film, read up on the dangers of contamination or considered first encounter protocols.They're on a mission and receive a strange broadcast from an inhabitable world that has no inhabitants on it. They land on this brand new, unknown planet and wander around as if they are in the Brecon Beacons. No gloves, no masks, kicking over brand new flowers, throwing cigarettes in the bushes, keeping the doors open on the lander etc. I'm not a tree hugger or anything but the apathy in their 'discovery' of this new planet smacks of blatant disregard. And because of this relentless stupidity, you just don't care about any of the characters. In one scene two separate characters slip over on the floor to make them easy bait for the Alien.The infections, mutations and eventual expulsions from their host bodies seem to happen in minutes (because waiting would be frightfully boring) and rather than generate tension or fear just seem to be a little too exploitative and some kind of torture porn. No one is thinking of contamination, no one is that bothered about the lives of the sleeping colonists of whom they have responsibility. No one seems to hear gunfire, no one picks up on individuals acting angry then them showing you their experiments and then saying 'take a look inside this egg that has just opened'.I remember watching Life and people comparing it to Alien. At least in Life, the astronauts are conscious of the danger of the alien organism getting down to Earth. In Covenant it doesn't even seem to cross people's minds. And the final 'twist' is so patently obvious it's genuinely laughable.Overall the film was a collection of loud, noisy scenes that the makers wanted to film but not properly set up. It was disconnected, unengaging and a tired lazy cash in on the Alien franchise.",4,8,16,15 May 2017
