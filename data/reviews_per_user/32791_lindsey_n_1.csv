The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Solid Film Given The Content Of The Book
","If you have read the books, you may agree with me that Mockingjay was by far the weakest of the trilogy. The first half (or maybe even more) was painfully dull for me to read.. it wasn't until it got to the finale at the end the book picked up. This being said, I think they did a good job with the movie considering this. Yes, the movie lacks the excitement of the games that the other two had. If you had read the books you would know to expect a more political film than action-packed. I felt they played up the events in the first part of the book enough to keep the movie from being boring but it didn't feel over the top all the same. The cast delivered great performances. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing and Hemsworth proved himself with the larger role he played in this movie. Julianne Moore was a great addition as Coin (and my god she's beautiful!). Philip was incredible and it warmed my heart to see his smile on the theatre screen. The dedication at the end of the film to Philip made me very happy and sad all at the same time. I say go see Mockingjay. It may not be on par with Catching Fire but it sets the tone for a very promising part 2. The end with the return of Peeta was exciting and although it was the predictable place to end the film, it helped to preview just some of the intensity the 2nd part of the movie will have.",7,16,47,20 November 2014
