","First of all ,when i saw the movie the first time ,i really shocked by the Florya his little kid gave me a different explanation about how a kid could change the whole story .So the movie based on the story between Nazis and russians.I feel very heavy when the Nazis start to kill those russians and put those russians in a big wooden house ,start burning them alive ,i can feel the same way as the russians do .During world war 2 .Japanese army came to China and killed a lot Chinese people ,they raped Chinese women used very horrible way to do a lot experiments on Chinese people's bodies .which i can feel very pain when the Nazis did the same thing to Russians .From my perspective ,the director did a very good job when he shot scene when those people in the wooden house ,its hard to control those elder people and children .I found that one sense is very meaningful ,after Russian solders came ,arrested the Nazis ,they could burn them ,but they didn't chose to do it ,because they cant ,even though they did a lot bad things to Russians ,but from a human's side .They chose to shoot them instead of burning them.After that,Florya found the Nazi woman in the forest ,she was killed by the russians ,i thought he will help her ,but he didn't ,he found the bondies to cover the gun .He start to shoot the pic that a woman hold a child ,actually he didn't shoot ,he just uses his imaginenation ,after the movie ,one question came out ,killing after killing ,whats left?the anger between different nations ?we do not need war any more ,the only thing we need is peace .",Null,1,1,26 July 2011
