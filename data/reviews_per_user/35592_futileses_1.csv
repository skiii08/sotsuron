The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Sublime
","I wasn't ready for this, when this film was released i expected something like Juno and i didn't want to watch it. I was so wrong! This is not some bad junk like Twiligth. The cast is amazing:Logan Lerman's performance as Charlie is outstanding, i believe that he got exactly what the character is supposed to represent, not a psycho, not a loser, just a kid with good taste, a nonconformist who wants to fit into society without changing his personality. Logan's facial expressions are impressive, he manages to play Charlie without falling into an apathetic character. A+Ezra Miller, as Patrick, is even better, he plays a wonderful person, full of surprises, i think that he drowned himself in the role and that's what makes me even more amazed by his performance. A++Emma Watson has proved with this film that she is not just a pretty face,that she is capable of more than Hermione, she was the weak link, but she did it. B+I haven't read the book, so i can't really tell if the movie is a bad adaptation, but i can tell you that this is a really good film. Not one bad performance!",9,2,4,8 March 2013
