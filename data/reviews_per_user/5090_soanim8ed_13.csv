Howl's Moving Castle," This is art
","Howl's Moving Castle is as marvelous and magical as Miyazaki's other great work. Something in Disney's advertising or the description I read gave the false impression that it was going to be sub-standard work meaning it was still going to be better than anything DreamWorks Animation was doing (Madagascar was sooo pedestrian).While not as awe-inspiring as Spirited Away or action-packed as Mononoke, it does work on the level of Kiki's Delivery Service as a girl is forced to be better than she thinks she can be (well, that's not a big surprise, that's all his films). And as with all Miyazaki stories, the story teaches without being preachy. And the lessons learned are represented in character changes and in the character's physical appearance as well. It's that same attention to detail that has made Pixar so great.The animation is wonderful. The castle is itself is a mesh-mash of so many haphazardly arranged pieces that an engineer would have an aneurysm just sorting them all out and yet it works. Through magic, of course. The magic being Howl's and the authoritative hand of Miyazaki's direction. The airships (wow, airships in a Miyazaki film? Who would have thunk?) are great variations of one's he's used before and there are some rather dark and beautiful scenes of a world at war.Most of the voice work was very strong including Christian Bale (Howl) and Emily Mortimer (as the young version of the heroine, Sophie). The voice that surprised me was Billy Crystal as Calcifer, the little flame that could. He's the heart of the castle and only annoyed at his first few scenes then becomes a very likable character.There a few clunky moments in the plot line where transitions between story points weren't very strong, but overall it's another outstanding film from Studio Ghibli. Even my 40 year old partner, who had spent the day mountain biking, was dead tired and had never seen a Miyazaki film stayed awake for the entire 2 hours. When we left at 3:30 in the morning still jabbering away about all the imagery and meaning, we realized we had seen true art.",10,267,309,6 June 2005
Underworld," Creme-filled spongecake.
","Did you know there has been a war going on for hundreds of years?  And it all started because the upper class and lower class dared to fall in love and have an abomination for a baby?  Master vs. Servant!  Father vs. Daughter!  Oh, the drama! How can they fit all this into one movie!  Easy, Underworld leaves out any sense of character development and relies on convoluted and cliched story lines.  But there is plenty of fun action to distract you from remembering you don't give a lick about the leading characters (what was Kate Beckinsale thinking?).  It's like eating Twinkie.  Oh sure, it was fun to eat, but once it's gone you wonder why you ever indulged.",6,0,0,15 September 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Ye be shanghaied by this one.
","Ahoy, me hearties!  The pirate movie be back and, blimey, if it be keelhaulin' the scurvy- ridden bilge that be marooned in yon summer theaters.
Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl is a big, sprawling adventure.  The kind you don't see anymore and it's a damn shame.  The script is smart. It allows the characters to figure things out.  It keeps you in the film.  Yeah, it may be a tad too long at its two hour and twenty-four minute run time, but it flies by a good portion of the time.The acting is superb with not a single person acting in any self-conscious way that would reveal they are in a pirate movie.  Geoffrey Rush is great as Captain Barbossa with his pirate-like growl.  He even utters 'Arrrr' much to the delight of the audience. Casting off his turn as an elf, Orlando Bloom takes on the unlikely hero role with vigor enough to prove his acting chops.Of course, the real star here is Johnny Depp as the fey pirate, Jack Sparrow, a pirate captain without a ship.  In fact, Depp gets the best movie entrance this summer in a leaky, sinking dinghy.  His character he claims is based on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and it shows.  He is half-crazed and swishes around delivering the best lines in the film.  Yet, he is completely believable and never goes (dare I say it?) overboard.  I say it's about damn time the Academy stood and noticed one of our generation's most versatile and creative actors, but that's just me.Pirates is one of those adventure films that will have you grinning with pleasure through most of its high-spirited hijinks and is right behind Finding Nemo for pure summer fun. Ye be a swab if ye miss this one.  Sink me, if I don't be givin' this movie four st-arrrrs.",9,0,1,15 July 2003
Finding Nemo," How I Found Finding Nemo
","If you can get past the first 15 minutes of Pixar's latest, you'll get a movie that is on par with their four other feature films.  Finding Nemo turns out to be a big, adventure film with a lot of laughs and a heart that is barely on the good side of manipulation.  Once the adventure starts, the emersion into the film begins and doesn't let you go.The movie plays up on over-protective parents, kids overcoming their disabilities, friendships conquering obstacles, addicts joining together to be better people (uh, fish), building self-esteem, realizing and accepting strengths and curmudgeons learning to lighten up.  All this in an animated, family-oriented, 'G' movie?  You bet! Pixar are the masters at the making everyone happy film.  They give the parents being dragged into the theater something to enjoy as well.If only they had done something with that beginning.  The films opens in a fish suburbia complete with happy families, beautiful homes and a peaceful way of life all with no hint of sardonic humor.  Yes, there are people who think that is heaven, but what about those who make fun it?  At least give them something to chuckle about.  It's Utopia for the Family Values set and completely out of character for Pixar.It's at this point I thought they had finally produced their first sub-standard film.  That is until a barracuda changes the main characters lives forever and Albert Brooks goes into, well, Albert Brooks mode.  Marlin (Albert Brooks) has a son, Nemo, who has an underdeveloped fin and therefore can't swim well.  This combined with the catastrophe at the beginning of the film causes Marlin to smother Nemo.   Nemo, finally fed up, rebels, ends up being caught by a diver and spirited away.  Marlin sets out after Nemo and that's when the film finally picks up with some adventure and some laughs.And when that laugh level is revved up, it's supplied by the scene-stealing Ellen DeGeneres as a blue tang named Dory.  Dory is basically an idiot savant. She has a severe short-term memory loss problem.  Now fish are believed to have no short-term memory so the jokes on the surface play on this; however, in a scene where Dory is faced with being alone without friends again, you wonder if it's a form of denial.  She says in the scene that she doesn't want to forget anymore and that having Marlin around helps her remember because he is the only one that has stuck by her.  Does she really have this problem or is it that she is so disappointed with no one understanding her that she hides everything? The scene is multi-layered and heart wrenching.  Ellen plays it surprisingly well as if she identifies with what Dory is going through. That's what makes the scene work so well.  Many of us have gone through the same thing and know how she feels.There are many, many memorable scenes in the film as Marlin attempts to find Nemo who is now in a fish tank in a dentist office.  One of the scenes is supplied in a superb performance by William Dafoe as Gill, an angelfish in the tank with Nemo who is from the ocean (not a pet store) and dreams of escaping and taking his new friends with him. He devises a scheme to get them out that is hair-brained and daring, but with one little plot hole that the film plays up to hilarious effect at the end.  Another great scene is with a trio of sharks that have sworn off fish in the most unlikely AA meeting imaginable.  Their motto:  'Fish are our friends and not food!'Finding Nemo is grand and exciting adventure that once it gets beyond it's slow opening turns into exactly what you expect from the masterminds at Pixar.  A film that is imaginative and visually stunning with big adventures for everyone no matter how old they are on the outside.",9,2,3,26 May 2003
Lost in Translation," An amazing film.
","Sofia Coppola's tale of friendship and loneliness is a near pitch-perfect film and the best I've seen so far this year.  It's also Bill Murray's best performance.  He is nothing short of amazing playing a has-been actor with whom the Japanese are still infatuated.The story takes place over a week period in Tokyo as we are introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte, played with much maturity by Scarlet Johannson. They are both stuck in a culture they don't understand and marriages they aren't sure are working anymore.  Charlotte's husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer who is always on a shot and leaves her in the hotel to fend for herself.She wanders around Tokyo and Bob keeps himself in the hotel bar where Charlotte finally bumps into him and a friendship is slowly developed.  This friendship saves them from the aching loneliness visually displayed by Sofia in long, beautiful shots of Johannson sitting in the hotel window looking out over the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo and Murray trying to find anything on Japanese television he can connect with.Don't get me wrong.  This is not a downer movie.  It is one of such various and vast emotions that I'm surprised Sofia fits them in to one little movie.  There are moments of great laughter and joviality such as the 'gift' that is sent to Bob's room. But even when when Charlotte and Bob's adventure begins it is quite apparent they are still not truly happy especially when they end up at a Karaoke bar and you get to see Murray's character singing Roxy Music's heart-breaking 'More Than This'.Some people may find the slight fun poking at the Japanese a little too much, but it's meant to show just how different their culture and ours are so different.  A few scene are down right gut-busting and others just drive the character's actions as they try to something to hold on to they can identify with.  It's an amazing cornucopia of events and emotions.I found out, too, that Sofia went to Tokyo many times with her father, Francis Ford Coppola (you may have heard of him), and I wonder if they story is somewhatautobiographical.  Did she met a has-been actor when she was left behind in the hotel room as her father went off to do some film work?  Either way, Sofia has made a small masterpiece that proves that she did indeed get the filmmaker gene.",10,0,0,15 September 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Fun, but...
","A Terminator movie without James Cameron?  How could they?  Easily, it seems. Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines takes place ten years after Terminator 2: Judgment Day.  John Connor is in his early twenties and has been hiding and running since he and his mother stopped Judgment Day from happening.      As it turns out Judgment Day is inevitable and the machines go back in time again kill off not only John Connor, but his lieutenants as well.  Enter Arnold again who is sent back to protect not only Connor but Kate Brewster (played by Claire Danes).   In the midst of this is a new Terminator unit T-X or as Connor calls her at one point, Terminatrix.  She is a sleek, super-model killer and virtually unstoppable. In their attempt to escape, they outrun the T-X in a vet truck in one of the most destructive car chases put on film.      It's all very exciting and fun with a slight human element that doesn't go as deep as T2 went, but they try.  Claire Danes and Nick Stahl (Connor) don't really have too much chemistry between them; however, Arnold does with his deep-pan delivery and his new psychology sub-routine, which leads to the most humorous moments in the film.    Jonathan Mostow had some big shoes to step into taking on this directing project and he does a bang-up job (pun intended).  He has captured the feeling of excitement and loss that is in the first two of knowing the world is coming to an end, but frankly without Linda Hamilton's strong female character, this film lacks some of the spunk that made T1 and T2 great.",8,0,0,10 July 2003
Spirited Away," Solving problems without violence
","Spirited Away is the latest in a string of incredible animated films by Hayao Miyazaki, the most renowned animator in Japanese history and most say in the best in world.  He takes a couple steps close to the best in the world title with this film. It's the story of Chihiro as she is caught in a world where humans are not allowed: a world of magic, gods and a Japanese bathhouse.  As we meet Chihiro we realize that she is a bit spoiled and has never done anything for herself.  As her adventures progress, she matures in ways that she doesn't even realize.  This is a journey of self-discovery and a study in forced independence.  Many have compared it to Alice In Wonderland, but where Alice, I thought, was a two-dimensional character going from adventure to adventure, Chihiro is well rounded.  She figures out how to be adaptable to an ever-changing world and discovers how to solve her problems instead of running away from them.  She is a `real' girl shoved into a world of Japanese mythology where she is ignorant of the rules.And her problem solving is the best part of the film and the reason I liked this one better then Princess Mononoke.  Chihiro uses her kindness, courage and courtesy as her weapons.  Even when violence erupts all around her, she relies on her wit and intelligence instead of magic, swords or arrows. These are lessons that children should be exposed to instead of explosions and gore that make up a lot of cinema. If I had kids, you bet I'd be taking them to see this one.But don't get me wrong; this film is able to thrill adults, too.  It is so full of imagination the film seems barely able to contain itself.  While it is not as lush as Mononoke (it may have been the print I saw), Spirited Away is gorgeously animated and the dubbing work is almost perfectly synched.  In fact, after Chihiro is whisked away I didn't even notice anything out of place.There were; however, about three scenes that I remember thinking that the score seemed out of place and became distracting, but that's my only complaint.  I can easily see why this is Japan's biggest moneymaking film of all time.  It's a story well told with visuals beautiful to behold.  It's simply timeless.",10,3,5,29 August 2002
Seabiscuit," Great docudrama.
","As a docudrama, Seabiscuit plays wonderfully.  Here are reenactments of the most important moments of the horse and the people who loved him.  As a piece of cinema it lacks slightly.  It's interesting and even compelling at times, but never gripping nor engrossing.  You could watch the same thing on the History Channel and still be just as entertained, which is not necessarily a bad thing.It's the story of the rise and fall and rise again of a race horse that no one cared about until Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) takes a chance with not only the horse, but a trainer most think is crazy (Chris Cooper) and a jockey who is a down-and-out loser (Tobey Maguire).  The result is history as the film spells out all too well.Although today's economy is not as bad as it was during the early 1900's, it's still an interesting parallel that helps the film.  You know the pain and anguish they are going through and so start to root for them despite knowing that everything will turn out all right in end.  How else could the best-known underdog story of that generation turn out any other way?",8,0,0,23 July 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Big, pulpy fun
","Spoiler Alert!! It's quite apparent from Kill Bill Volume One that Quentin Tarantino has not lost any of his love for pulp fiction.  From the opening black and white sequence of Uma Thurman to the final almost touching final fight scene with Lucy Liu, Kill Bill has the makings of an epic cult film.  I say cult film because I'm sure the movie will polarize audiences. Tarantino takes some big risks with his film genre bending and mixing. Most of them pay off.The action sequences that were talked about are actually not as sustained as rumoured. In fact, it really shows a sign of maturity in Tarantino that the action takes breaks so the audience can take a breath before the characters start in on each other again.  It makes the characters more human, too, since even those in the best shape could not withstand these constant pounding without taking a short breather.
The story?  It's a revenge plot, plain and simple, and as pulpy as those get.  Plus the actors are all quite up to that task.  They all go about chewing up the scenery, which fits quite nicely into the film as it's set up.  It's good to see Thurman again. Here she takes the lead as The Bride with much vigor and attitude because The Bride is p***ed.  Her old assassin team has killed her entire wedding party and even tried to kill her, but didn't quite finish the job.  Now she wants to get even.And it's great fun.  With over the top fight scenes with heads and limbs flying to bodies squirting blood like hoses, Tarantino is wearing his cheesy gore film influences on his sleeve.  There are several film genres here and the best is the back story on Lucy Liu's character when the film switches to Japanese anime to set up the audience for the second half of the film which takes place in Japan.  The dialogue is more classy in this half of the film only between Thurman and Liu.  Instead of using the F-word (as Tarantino is want to do in his films), they shoot more witty barbs at each other as if there was once great respect between them.  This sets up a scene at the end of their fight that is actually touching and makes The Bride human instead of just a killing machine.Of course, the film ends with a cliff hanger because Miramax didn't want to release a 3 hour plus film; however, with some creative editing it ends nicely and sets up for Kill Bill Volume Two.  It gives hints about The Bride's husband, the baby she was carrying, how she was found after going into hiding and her relationship with Bill to name a few things.  All of which are very soap opera, but a soap that is very stylized and willing to take chances.  None of this would have worked had it not been for Tarantino being self- aware he was just making a big piece of entertaining fluff.  In other hands, it would have just been another over-wrought pile of junk.  And even if Miramax cut it in two, it's nice to know that they have allowed out a film that tries to push the envelope.",9,0,0,26 September 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The spell is almost right.
","Last year amid the hoopla of the release of Harry Potter And The Sorcerer'sStone, movie goers forgot what made the books wonderful and clamored for avisual representation of a book they had grew to love.  What they got was a fun movie, but one that had the emotion and spirit of the book sucked away by apage-by-page direct translation to the screen.  In Chamber Of Secrets it is very apparent that Chris Columbus and companyhave learned from their first experience and have produced a superior product. The spirit is intact this time around with Harry having a much darker and more intense adventure.  In fact, it may be too intense for some kids.  There are some legitimately scary areas of the film including a harrowing escape from giantspiders and a fight to the death with the monster that is petrifying the students at Hogwarts.At the other end of the wand though is a great mystery adventure that is in-line with the great Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew stories that non-readers of theseries can follow.  Plus it helps that the cast is so terrific.  Daniel Radcliffe improves himself and expands the character of Harry Potter.  Emma Watson issuperb as Hermione and Rupert Grint is just hilarious as Ron Weasley.  The rest of the original cast is back as well with another quirky yet humorous portrayal of Snape.But since this is a new book there are bound to be new characters including the animated Doby the house elf and some other teachers who appear in the book,but we haven't seen until now.  The stand out is the new Defense Against TheDark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is played to pompous perfection byKenneth Branagh.  In fact, it is almost worth the price of the movie just to see him flitter around like the peacockish fop that he is.  Just brilliant.There is a major problem with the film though: the ending.  It is immensely corny and hackneyed and takes you right out of the story.  It just doesn't belong. It's almost as if Columbus, having already resigned as director, just gave up andcame back home to America.  The events that happen are not worthy of J.K.Rowling's books or of this fun and entertaining film.",9,0,0,11 November 2002
X2: X-Men United," Xtraordinay
","Here we are again at the beginning of another summer season of blockbusters and, to start it all off, Hollywood has delivered unto us X2 (or X-Men 2 if you prefer).  And a little blessing it is.   Especially if you like your social rights movies with tight, leather costumes. Bryan Singer has taken to heart the ideals of this comic book world and has outdone the first X-Men.  Sure there are some great action sequences, but the real beauty of the film is he allows us to get to know these characters with all their flaws thus we have a chance to care for them between the butt-kickings.Basically the entire X-Men universe is a story about intolerance of people who are different.  Those who collect the comics know that this gives the story real depth and believability in a world of spandex wearing crime fighters.  There are several layers to the intolerance.  Magneto (the role Ian McKellen's terrified is the one we'll all remember him by) is at one end of the intolerance by means of the extermination of the entire non-mutant population.  He briefly joins the X-Men and has a little heart-to-heart with one of the new kids, Pyro.  He tells Pryo in a character defining moment, 'You are a god among insects. Never let anyone tell you different.'  The scene where Bobby Drake aka Iceman 'comes out' to his parents as a mutant is played with some humor ('Have you tried to not be a mutant?'), but turns into the moral heart of the story as he is finally struck with the truth that not even his own brother accepts him.Meanwhile, back in Washington, the fear of the mutants' powers is still building and there are several people who don't want to settle for registration and surveillance of all mutants.  They want them completely destroyed.  Enter one of the most despicable villains to grace the screen in a while.  General William Stryker is a military experimentalist with a personal vendetta against all mutants.  Brian Cox plays him beautifully.  Just when you think he can sink no lower, he throws out something else that makes you love to hate him even more; however, he never plays it for camp.  The character is a heartless, bitter man who will do anything to rid of the world this pestilence.The opening sequence is an explosive introduction to Nightcrawler played with uncommon restraint by Alan Cumming.  Hugh Jackman is back as Wolverine and this time really does get to break loose when a troop of military men breaks into Professor X's school.  The violence in the scene was surprising since the first movie had very little death.  In other words, let the summer movie body count begin.After winning her Oscar, it seems that Halle Berry is trying very hard to remove the aftertaste of her performance in X-Men ('Hold on to something').  She portrays Storm with more vigor and it helps that they gave her a little more to do as well. There is confidence in her acting that wasn't there the first time around.All in all, X2 is pretty extraordinary.  Here is a well-made superhero movie about real, current problems in a world of mutant human beings and villains with Hitler-esque intentions:  A fun, action film with a message.  If this is an indication of this summer's blockbusters, then hooray for Hollywood.",9,0,0,26 May 2003
Amélie," How Romantical.
","Ah, the French.  So romantic, or least that's the stereotype and the newest French film from the great director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City Of Lost Children), won't put an end to that.  In fact, it will perpetuate the belief beyond all reason.  You see Amelie is a film that should melt the heart of the most frigid cynic, but you know cynics, they just won't let go of their hurt.The story involves a woman who discovers the ability to make other peoples' lives better, but won't use that power on herself.  That's the simple.  The complex is the film itself.  It is beautiful, colorful, quirky, funny, strange, moving, lovely and romantic as all get out.Each new conquest of Amelie's is stranger and more complex than the last and almost all of them reward you with a great laugh or the ability to put yourself in her shoes and feel a sense of accomplishment of making others happy.  However, as you sit there basking in the afterglow, you also feel the underpinnings and loneliness that she feels.  She won't let go of it. She doesn't feel she deserves it, so she continues to manipulate others into happiness therefore she doesn't have to deal with her own pain.Don't fret though.  Into Amelie's life walks a man of mystery and good looks, who, from the moment they lock eyes, knows he must meet this wonderful and strange girl.  Thus begins one of the most bizarre and fun courtships ever put to film.  They put up posters around town asking to meet, play scavenger hunt and wear disguises all because Amelie isn't comfortable with herself.Jeunet's sense of timing and humor work well for this film.  His quirky camera angles and movements and use of special effects actually add to the story and don't distract.  Plus he's worked hard with his crew to bring color and amazement to Paris that could only be real in the movies.Don't let the fact that it's subtitled dissuade you from seeing Amelie. This is one of the best films in many years and very deserving of an audience.  Plus you can bet right now that it will most likely walk away with the Foreign Language Oscar this March.  Drag your romantic side out of the closet and take it on a movie date.  Amelie will make you believe in love again.",10,1,4,7 December 2001
Tarzan," Moves like liquid.
","Well, being the big animation fan that I am, I went to see Tarzan this afternoon.  Wow.When I first heard that Disney was doing a version of the Tarzan story, I was hesitant.  I mean who wants to hear an ape man spouting out show tunes? Hakuna Matata!  The only songs are some of the best work Phil Collins has done in many years.  He ventures into the Peter Gabriel territory, but does a great job especially with the rhythms since he IS a drummer.  The open number (and sequence) is best albeit Lion King-esque.  It seems he was very inspired by the material and has rediscovered his love of music.  It's very uplifting.  Don't misunderstand me, the characters do sing, but it's more Rosie O'Donnell doing scat with the other apes as they destroy a camp and a very welcome singing cameo by Glenn Close doing the beginning of a lullaby that Phil takes over.As for the picture itself:  wow!  This is the most beautiful Disney animation ever:  lush, detailed, quick and smooth.  Tarzan moves like liquid, filling the screen with gymnastic ease especially the scene where he fights a leopard to save his ape family.And family is what this film is all about.  Disney's Tarzan makes a different decision that Edgar Rice Burroughs' and I think it works better, but it's the decision I would make in the same situation.  Some of the situations are a little contrived, but it is mostly Disney sticking with a winning formula.  (Tarzan does have nipples unlike Aladdin).  :-)  What surprised me was the dramatic tilt of the film. Rosie O'Donnell's ape and the elephant are the only comic relief and don't have much of it.  The film is very skewed towards adults; HOWEVER, as I was surrounded by a mob of kids there was dead silence right after the main gorillas lose their baby and Tarzan loses his parents to the leopard at the beginning.  All the questioning ceased and I got to enjoy the film in complete 'adult-like' silence.  The kids were just as wrapped up in the movie as the adults.The voice talent was well cast, too.  Minnie Driver is great as the strong, yet proper British lady of the time.  Her father is a stereotypical egghead professor who is as clumsy as he is smart.  And then there is Brian Blessed as the villain, Clayton.  Man, do I love his voice! It's the Voice of God!  The deep, rich tones always give me a chill.  I wish he worked in more films other then Kenneth Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare films, but alas.... (well, I guess he WAS in The Phantom Menace)This truly is one of Disney's classics.  I felt the same way walking out of this one as I did from Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.Oh, look for a cameo from Mrs. Potts and Chip from Beauty and the Beast!  I thought it was funny, but I don't think anyone else in the theater got it since I seemed to be the only one laughing.   I always embarrass myself at the movies it seems.",8,12,13,18 June 1999
