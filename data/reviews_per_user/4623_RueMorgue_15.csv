The Blair Witch Project," The most misunderstood movie in horror history. (POSSIBLE Spoilers).
","Note:  This comment MAY contain spoilers, depending on your point of view. If you haven't seen TBWP, and don't know the background of the film, STOP reading NOW.There isn't much to say about this film that hasn't already been said. Everybody and his brother (or sister, as the case may be) has made and reiterated their point about this film.  But the fact remains, that this low-budget wonder turned box-office hit is a scary movie.Myself, I watched this movie at home, with all the lights turned off, and the volume turned up high.  I didn't watch it alone, however, and now I wish I did.  The main problem with my viewing of the film was that I had already heard all the hype, and as much as I tried to stay away from it, I knew most of the background of this film.  That is another thing I regret.The fact is, I believe that if one views this movie as it was intended to be viewed, with no background knowledge, it will scare the daylights out of the viewer.  It is a classic terror film.  I know there are many who would disagree with me.While I do not believe that this film can be ranked up with previous horror hits such as The Exorcist, the result was the same in many movie theaters in North America.  People complained of dizziness, nausea, and some had to leave the theater early because they couldn't take it any more.  The same thing happened with The Exorcist.  The symptoms from Blair were often the result of watching the shaky, multi-camera views, while The Exorcist was a blast of both imagery and sound that left the viewer reeling in his/her seat.  The result of the whole experience, agree with me or not on both counts, was terror.There are those horror movie buffs out there, I'm sure, who complain that Blair was not classic horror, that the premise was faulty and the background was simply unbelievable.  Yet, I'm sure that these were people like me. They knew the background of the film, and were thus not affected as the writers, directors, and cast had originally intended.  I believe that if people saw this film as was meant to be, they would have been scared out of their wits.  I also think that many people, on examination of the film, downplayed how it made them feel.  In other words, the same people that say the film was terrible, probably sat in the theater and were scared themselves at some point during the film.Overall, I believe that this is the most misunderstood movie in horror history.  If it had been viewed by the masses as it was originally intended, it would have scared the pants off almost anybody.  I know it scared me... even though I already knew what it was all about.  As I have said in the past, any movie that can make me think when it is over, is one that I enjoy. This movie will leave many questions in your mind, but as I said before, only if viewed as it was originally intended.My Rating:  9/10",9,1,2,29 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty good prequel, doesn't live up to expectations.
","Well, the critics have been up and down this film already, and I don't imagine that I am going to add anything huge to the debate, but I feel that I have to add my two cents in anyways.As said in the summary, this film didn't live up to my expectations.  I never thought it would, to be honest.  Episodes IV, V, and VI were so far ahead of their time when they were released that they made movie history. It's very difficult to top something like that.  While this film is packed with computer animation and has some very excellent action scenes (the pod race scene is excellent), I believe that the animation put the film over the edge.  Put simply, there was just too much of it.  I'm sure that every director and studio just loves computer animation, and this film had pretty good effects!  But when compared to the earlier films, taking into consideration the fact that those films used a lot of models for their shots, the animation here is just saturating.Having said that, this movie gives us the beginning of the history behind Episodes IV, V, and VI.  The storyline here is actually pretty good, and follows well with the type of plot that should be expected of any Star Wars film.  This movie certainly remains true to its 'roots' , so to speak, and that was nice to see.  I'm also glad that Lucas didn't stray from the art of telling a good story by showing us events happening in other areas.  He also kept the usual Star Wars 'scene change' of having the current scene replaced by one in a different place by having the new scene move in across the old one.  While some believe that is a 'cheesy' effect, it still remains familiar, and I'm glad it's kept here.Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn) and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) are good in their roles, and Jake Lloyd is excellent as a young Anakin Skywalker.  However, I think that Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala) steals the show here.  Her acting is above that of Carrie Fisher as the female 'lead' in the earlier Star Wars series, and it will be interesting to see how they develop her character in the rest of the prequels.This film is mandatory for any Star Wars fan, but I'm sure it will have a lower appeal to the average person, which is the reason why Episodes IV, V, and VI were released earlier in the first place.  However, 'The Phantom Menace' carries on the tradition of one of the best science-fiction franchises in the history of film.My Rating:  9.5/10",7,8,11,3 June 2000
The Fan," Bogged down by a poor storyline.
","It never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor, and put him to waste in a film such as this.  Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he couldn't save this movie.  In fact, his character is much the same as the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can't stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie.  I believe it gets old, and that is the case here.There's nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before.  Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his conceit shows through in his characterization.  De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than entertaining.However, because De Niro is IN this film, that makes it a draw if you are a fan (no pun intended) who sees everything he does no matter how bad.  But to see De Niro at his best, see 'Midnight Run', 'Goodfellas', or 'Cop Land', or even go way back and check out 'Taxi Driver' or 'Godfather II'.  Don't waste your time with this drivel.My Rating:  3/10",4,6,11,2 June 2000
Blade," Hokey, but so what? A pretty entertaining ride nevertheless.
","Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side.  It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), but this tries very hard.  I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea.  (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.)  So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating?  Because it tries.  It tries very hard.  In my book, that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film.Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus. It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever.  Some of those ideas are included here.  The storyline is familiar... a group of vampires conspire to take over the world, with one person (mainly) standing in their way.  Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses, who have slowly but surely moved into the world, and share it with humankind.  For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them.  The vampires have even taken familiars, people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being 'turned.'Now that I think of it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film, They Live.  A hidden enemy, hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save human-kind... all that is present in Blade as well.The acting isn't the best here.  Snipes is, at best, only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, isn't too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's sidekick (he's to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher).  Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here, as the 'head' vampire you just love to hate.I don't know, but I just loved the special effects in this film.  From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave, all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film, the special effects aren't half bad.  There's certainly enough blood and gore to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right?  The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique, and not generally used in contemporary action films.  Snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with, say, a machine gun. Plus, there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away.  (Unless, of course, you are Indiana Jones.)Overall, this isn't the best action film ever made, but it's not half bad, either.  As a bonus, the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool, too. Tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?!My Rating:  8/10",8,0,1,9 May 2001
Cast Away," There's no Immunity Idol here... only man vs. nature. (Possible Spoilers.)
","While CBS's Survivor may be entertaining, it certainly is nothing like being stranded on a deserted island all by yourself, with no comforts of home. First of all, on TV, all the contestants have each other... other people with which to communicate, to fight with, to laugh with, and to cry with. They also receive various trinkets and surprises from the producers of the show.  Survivors?  Yeah, right... more like rats in a cage.Along comes another superb Tom Hanks film.  Somebody somewhere said that nobody could do this like Tom Hanks, and it's true.  Where else can you find a film that you can watch for 50+ minutes with only a small bit of spoken word, and remain entertained?  I've watched many a film late in the evening, with much more action than this film, and still fallen asleep.
So what is it about this film?  You want to see what happens next.  Tom Hanks pulls this off beautifully.  The ups and downs, the trials and errors, the good and the bad, it's all in here.  As a high-level FedEx employee, Chuck Noland (Hanks) knows about the passage of time... he lives by it. However, when his plane crashes somewhere over the Pacific, and he finds himself stranded alone on a deserted island, with nothing except his wits, an old watch containing a picture of his girlfriend, a rubber raft, and the contents of a few FedEx packages that have washed up on shore, he has to make the best of his surroundings.This begins a quest in which Noland learns about himself, his surroundings, and his will to survive and beat the odds.  It is a beautifully filmed story, with superb acting, and an excellent plot.  This is a definite must if you are a fan of Tom Hanks, or if you like to rent movies which draw you into the story.It is also an eye-opener for those of us who don't know how we would deal with the tremendous obstacle of being alone with little hope of rescue. Most of my time on this movie was spent afterwards, exploring how I felt about the film, and the situation.  That, if nothing else, is worth viewing this film.My Rating:  9/10",9,0,0,16 June 2001
American Beauty," An Oscar well deserved.
","This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism.  However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind.  Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film.  I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time.  I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it.  I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating.  However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film.  While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind.  I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a 'comedy-drama', I don't see anything about this film as funny.  Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty.  But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.My Rating:  10/10",10,529,628,29 May 2000
Apocalypse Now," Take a journey into the Heart of Darkness...
","With the flood of war stories on the shelves of your local video store, it is often hard to separate the wheat from the chaff.  This is especially true when taking into consideration the number of films centering around the Vietnam war.  This particular film is among the best, however.Based on Joseph Conrad's book 'Heart of Darkness', this is the story of one man's trip into the lion's den.  He is given a mission by his superiors, and undoubtedly, it will change his life.  From beginning to end, this film is a descent into the madness of war.  With fantastic imagery, superb characters, and an excellent adaptation of Conrad's story, this film is tops.I first watched this film about 5 years ago, when I was taking a history course in University that dealt with the Vietnam war.  Well, I was surprised to find that the story many history textbooks tell doesn't come close to the events represented in this book.  While fictional, this film put the Vietnam war into a whole new light.  It is violent, it is dark, and it is all too real.If you have never seen this film, what are you waiting for?  Many people can't be bothered to see a war film, whether it be due to the violence, or the fact that many of them are the same as any other.  This one stands alone, and it does so because it is so much more than a 'war film' per se. It is a story of insanity and darkness in times of war.  It shows the reasons why many men and women can and do slip from sanity into the depths of insanity in times of war.  And it is simply unforgettable.My Rating:  10/10After viewing this film, I suggest you watch 'Hearts of Darkness:  A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'.  It is a documentary of how the film was made, and the many issues and problems that surrounded the filming of this movie.  An awesome follow-up effort.",10,0,0,29 May 2000
Being John Malkovich," An amazing portrayal of the weird and wonderful.
","To say this film is weird is an understatement.  However, it is one of the better 'strange' films I have ever seen.  John Cusack is excellent in this film, as is John Malkovich himself.  After all, nobody but Malkovich could pull this film off to begin with.  Cameron Diaz is all but unrecognizable in her portrayal of Lotte Schwartz, but her performance here is only ho-hum.  I have learned not to expect much from her in anything but a comedy film anyways, especially after seeing Something About Mary.I recommend this film to those who want to see something fresh, and who enjoy movies that call for some thought.  I don't believe a story such as this has ever been tried before, and that makes the film more appealing.  I passed by it for a few weeks at the video store before committing to it, and now I'm glad I watched it.The premise is pretty simple.  While at work one day on the 7 1/2 floor, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), who is a puppeteer, finds a small door which allows him to enter the mind of John Malkovich and see through his eyes for a short period of time, and then be dumped out beside the New Jersey turnpike.  As word of this spreads, various hijinks and interpersonal relations are played out amongst the characters in the film.  Craig Schwartz finds his ultimate puppet, but at what cost?By the way, I loved the film in which John Malkovich played a jewel thief. ;)My Rating:  9/10",9,0,1,23 July 2000
The Game," A Non-Stop Action Ride
","Personally, I loved this movie.  From beginning to end, it is a wholly engrossing film, one that is extremely under-rated, in my opinion.It is the story of a wealthy financial player who is very arrogant, egotistical, and withdrawn at the same time.  As his birthday present, his brother buys him a gift certificate from a company called Consumer Recreation Services.  This company provides an experience to the customer, 'the game', which is different for everybody, and very mysterious.  The film is a non-stop action ride through 2 hours of plot twists, backstabbing, and surprises.  Once the game begins, Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) must see it through to its shocking conclusion.Michael Douglas is excellent as the ice-cold Van Orton, and Sean Penn does a superb job playing his brother, Conrad.  Deborah Unger, who also appears in director David Cronenberg's 'Crash', also plays her part very convincingly. In all, this movie shouldn't be missed, and should be viewed with an open mind.My Rating:  10/10",9,0,1,31 May 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Quite simply, the best story in the history of motion pictures.
","This is a story about the despair of life in prison, as well as the friendship and hope that can be found and maintained within its walls, against all odds.As mentioned above, and as far as I am concerned, this movie is the best of all time.  I have lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, and it touches me every time I watch it.  As a matter of fact, I just finished watching this movie on television, on a cable channel that cannot seem to get enough of showing this film.  I'm sure you know the one I mean, because they have shown this movie dozens of times, usually back to back. If you are a fan of this film, I'm sure you watch it every time it is on, much like I do, and are always amazed, yet again, at the end of it.This film is written so eloquently that I doubt much could top it.  Having not read the original short story by Stephen King (which is titled 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'), I cannot comment on the accuracy of the movie in relation to his telling of story.  However, I'm sure that it does justice to King's writing.  Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed Shawshank, also wrote the screenplay for and directed King's other prison film, The Green Mile, which also should not be missed.The acting here is excellent, but I doubt anybody would be surprised at that, given the cast present here.  Morgan Freeman (Se7en, Deep Impact, Kiss The Girls) has shown time and time again that he is one of Hollywood's best and most underrated actors, and he certainly shines here as Red, the man who 'knows how to get things.'  Freeman's narration is superb, I doubt a better job could have been done by anyone else.  In the history of film, people such as James Earl Jones and Martin Sheen never fail to provide narration that is highly eloquent, but this film shows that Freeman deserves to be in the same category as those two actors.  Tim Robbins does a great job as Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who knows he will remain in prison for a long time to come, but refuses to give up hope.Despite excellent writing and acting, however, I believe the most poignant thing about this film is the score.  Present at the best times, and lacking when it should be, the use of the score for this film helps set the tone and the mood for almost every scene.  Obviously, in a film set in a prison, there isn't much happiness to go around.  However, certain scenes in this film are defined by the score that goes with them, making the viewer look twice at a scene which would otherwise be quite drab and seemingly unimportant, and making them appear different than they are, thus impressing the theme of hope on the viewer in an almost subconscious fashion.Historically, of course, this film will never be viewed with the respect and honor it deserves, especially with newer, more appealing prison-based films available, such as the aforementioned The Green Mile.  It is unfortunate that Shawshank didn't win the Academy Awards it was nominated for, because it certainly deserved them.  However, during its Oscar year, it was up against a little Tom Hanks vehicle called Forrest Gump, a movie which held back most others that year, and deservedly so.  As often happens, seemingly to avoid one particular film taking home all the gold, Oscars were awarded to other films over Forrest Gump that year in various categories, and it's too bad that Shawshank wasn't one of them.I guarantee that you will love the characters of Andy & Red, along with the interaction between them; hate Warden Norton and his sniveling sidekick Captain Hadley; and be moved by the eloquent ending of this fantastic and unforgettable film.  It truly is an experience not to be missed. 
10/10, and I'd give it an 11 if I could.",10,0,0,6 May 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Unexpected Disney fare, but an unexpected delight.
","These comments are based on a viewing of the DVD version of this film.Simply put, this is Disney, but it isn't the Disney we are accustomed to. David Spade is notorious for his sarcasm and snide comments, and they abound in this film.  The storyline here is darker than previous Disney animated films.  One of the special features on the DVD is a deleted scene in which Pacha's village is destroyed, and while it is shown in its unfinished form, it is obvious why it wasn't included.  It is a very dark, violent, and foreboding scene, and it brings new light to the film, especially when watched after viewing the movie in its entirety.  Simply put, this isn't your typical children's movie, and it seems to be aimed at a more mature audience.The story revolves around Emperor Kuzco, an egotistical ruler with a heavy hand, who is turned into a llama by his nemesis Yzma and her faithful sidekick, Kronk.  Kuzco is ends up on Pacha's cart, and is transported back to his village, and various hijinks occur as Pacha tries to help Kuzco return to his palace, and ultimately regain his human form.In my humble opinion, Kronk steals the show here.  Spade & John Goodman do a good job as Emperor Kuzco and Pacha respectively, but Kronk, while something of an idiot, brings comedic moments to this film which are necessary.  Watch his facial expression on the way to the 'secret lab,' and keep an eye on him during the 'jump-rope' scene at Pacha's hut later on in the movie.  Simply put, it's hilarious.  Patrick Warburton's flat delivery of lines for this character adds dimension (surprisingly) to the 'typical idiot' character which appears in almost all Disney films.Rumor has it that this film was originally a lot different, a lot darker, until Disney stepped in and took over.  A viewing of the deleted scene gives some insight into what the film may have been like had it not been changed. I've always been amazed by the fact that Disney can make films geared at kids, but which also appeal to adults. However, more recently, and unfortunately, Disney has used its reputation for having excellent story lines and creating films which teach lessons to enter into the 'direct-to-video' market, thus taking advantage of children and their parents, and disappointing Disney fans who would rather see films which are good enough for theatrical release. Even though these particular films are released by Disney, they are just like any other 'direct-to-video' film.  They should be avoided, and aren't anything to write home about.While not as good as Tarzan or The Lion King,   The Emperor's New Groove is a pretty good way to keep the kiddies quiet on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, and the adults might get something out of it as well.Note:  The DVD version contains, among other goodies, a neat little animated game, a multiple choice Q&A which you can play with the children after they watch the movie.  To keep them extra quiet, tell them to watch close because they are going to be tested!  :)My Rating:  7/10",7,0,1,8 May 2001
The Sixth Sense," Amazing film, with a truly amazing ending.
","To be honest, given some of the work that Bruce Willis has done in the past, I wasn't at all interested in seeing this film after watching the various trailers.  In fact, I wasn't even one of the people in line at the video store the first Tuesday it was available.  Even more surprising, I didn't see this movie until it was available on video for almost two months!  It wasn't until many friends told me I absolutely had to see it that I caved in and rented it.  Seeing this film again just last week brought back a lot of memories with the second viewing, and I felt that I should add my two cents (six cents?) into the mix here.This film has one of the best story lines of any film released in 1999. Perhaps the best thing about it is that it isn't a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  It maintains a series of highs and lows, and then works up into a crescendo for the surprise ending.  You will think you have it figured out up until the last 15 minutes or so, and then what you expected to happen doesn't, and the experience becomes something else entirely.  I thought I had this film pegged... many of my friends had told me to be ready for the surprise ending... and my mouth hit the floor when it became painfully obvious what this movie was all about.Having related what I thought about the story, I'll move on to the acting and more technical aspects of this film.  First off, let me say that Bruce Willis simply shines in this movie.  As the grounding force in this film, he does an excellent job, perhaps not seen since his work in Twelve Monkeys or Pulp Fiction, in my humble opinion.  Usually known for his work in action films, he reminds us here yet again that he can be just as good in more dramatic and complex roles.The award for 'stealing the show' in this film must go to Haley Joel Osment, who had not done much of anything notable up until being cast in this film. I'm surprised that nobody else has used the talent this little guy has to its fullest potential.  This is probably the movie that will be known as the one that made his career.  Recently he turned down the opportunity to appear in the sequel to this film, and rightfully so.  I doubt if he could repeat the performance he turned out in this film, that's how excellent his acting was the first time around.  In all, I'm sure he made the correct decision, and has chosen to go on to bigger and better things, if that's possible.  At any rate, his facial expressions and simple innocence add credibility to the story in ways you cannot imagine.  He's unable to cope with the supernatural events in his life, until being helped through them by Willis, who plays his role as a child psychologist almost to the letter.Toni Collette is superb in her role as Cole's (Osment's) mother.  I had never seen Collette in anything before this, and I was very impressed.  It always amazes me how a director/casting agent can take a cast of (almost) unknowns and put them together in a film where they click and create a movie that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.  In a role where she plays a woman who is nothing if not extremely pained by the problems her son deals with on a daily basis, problems which he refuses to talk to her about, she does a beautiful job.  She is a very beautiful lady, and I can't wait to see her in more dramatic roles.While not generally scary, there are some slightly gory scenes, and some which create a feeling of terror deep within the pit of your stomach.  Of course, the use of the musical score within the film adds to the tension.  I felt as though I was watching something I shouldn't be at some points in the film, and I'm sure you can relate, or will be able to when you finally see it.If you haven't seen this movie, go rent it.  Make sure you watch it on a Friday or Saturday night, and late.  This will give you enough time to digest the film over the rest of the weekend, before heading back into the week on Monday.  If possible, watch it Friday night and again on Saturday night, just to pick up on what you may have missed.  After watching it once, knowing the ending will help you make note of a lot more the second time around.Watch for director M. Night Shyamalan in a cameo role as Dr. Hill, who examines Cole after his experience at the birthday party.  I must admit, I didn't see him the first time around.My rating:  10/10.",9,0,0,8 May 2001
Final Destination," Don't watch if you are getting on an airplane any time soon!
","This 'horror film' tries a bit too hard, but is fairly entertaining at the same time.  It's certainly no Exorcist, but then again, I don't think that movie will ever be topped as far as the fear/intensity level is concerned.Sitting in a plane waiting for takeoff for a school vacation, Alex (Devon Sawa) has a vision that the plane will explode shortly after takeoff.  He goes nuts, he and some of his friends (and one teacher/chaperone) get kicked off the plane, and lo and behold, it explodes shortly after takeoff.  Amidst suspicion, Alex watches as his friends are picked off one by one by the force that had intended to kill them all on the plane, if not for their untimely escape.This one gets some points for special effects (the plane crash 'vision' at the beginning is superb!) and gore, but loses points for storyline.  This is just too contrived, and predictable.  It's the old 'we were supposed to die but we didn't and now it's coming back to finish us off' theme.  I found that waiting to see who was going to die next, and in what fashion, was the most entertaining thing about this film.  Some of the methods, while nothing new, are portrayed quite well with the use of special effects.This is obviously an attempt to cash in on the recent return of teen-slasher flicks, with a slightly new angle.  Over all, it's not too bad, but it could have been a little better in the storyline department.  It's a cast of unknowns, too, so don't expect any Academy Award winning performances here.My Rating:  5/10",5,0,0,11 May 2001
The Breakfast Club," The cream of the crop in 80's fare.
","This movie is one of the best, if not THE best, 80's film there is.  The fact is, every teen character in this movie can be related to someone we knew in high-school.  As a child of the 80's, I can honestly say that this is a representative cross-section of every high school in North America. The geek, the jock, the outcast, the rich pretty-girl snob, and the future criminal.  They all exist, to some degree or another, in the classrooms of every high school on the continent.What makes this film rise above the rest is the character development. Every character in this film is three-dimensional.  They all change, in one way or another, by the end of the film.  Whether or not things remain the way they are long after this film ends is unknown, and that adds to the rama.  The most important scene in this film is when the characters, as a group, all open up to one-another and describe the hell that their daily school routines are in a personal fashion.  Nobody likes the role they must inevitably portray in the high-school scene, but the fact is, it is often inescapable.  This film gives the viewer some insight into how the other people around them might have felt during that particular time in their lives.Each of the main characters in this film shines, but Judd Nelson (John Bender) and Emilio Estevez (Andrew Clark) rise above the rest.  Simply put, these two actors each put their heart and soul into their respective characters, and it shows.At the end of the film, the viewer is left to make their own conclusions as to how things will carry forth.  And I'm sure that most people will do that. This is one movie that left me feeling both happy and sad for each of the characters, and it isn't easy to make me care about a film in that way. Even if you aren't a fan of the 80's genre, this isn't one you would want to miss.My Rating:  10/10",10,369,419,30 May 2000
All the President's Men," Political corruption doesn't get any better than this...
","When it comes to Watergate, this film is a must-see.  From break-in to resignation, this movie tells the story of the investigation by Woodward and Bernstein into the events at the Watergate Hotel, and the actions of those involved both before and after.  The two lead actors, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, simply shine as the two reporters.  As well, Jason Robards (Ben Bradlee), Hal Holbrook (Deep Throat), and Jane Alexander (The Bookkeeper) are well suited for their roles.  (Watch for Bradlee's late night conversation with Woodward and Bernstein about J. Edgar Hoover... it had me in stitches.)The events behind the basic premise of the film are well known, and well documented by history.  This film takes those events even further, by giving the viewer an inside view into the workings of the Washington Post during the scandal.  A seemingly ordinary break-in at the Watergate turns into news when Woodward (Redford) attends the arraignment of the burglars, and finds the whole situation to be very suspicious.  After teaming up with Bernstein (Hoffman), the two embark on a journey into the inner-workings of the United States Government, finding information in such places as the CIA, the Committee to Re-Elect the President, and the Justice Department.On first viewing this film, I was intrigued enough to do a bit of research on my own about Watergate, since at the time, it was something I didn't know very much about.  I read the book this movie was based on, along with the follow-up, as well as 'Watergate: The Corruption of American Politics and the Fall of Richard Nixon' by Fred Emery, an excellent read.  After reading those books, as well as some research, I viewed the film again.  It was amazing how much I saw the second time around, after doing some of my own research.  Names, dates, and activities which were all a blur after I first watched the film, started to make sense when I could put them in context. Therefore, I would suggest that you watch this film more than once, to get the whole picture.Put simply, the acting and directing in this film is excellent.  The story, while being well documented in various other media, gives a fresh insight into what made this break-in front-page news.  Anybody interested in the inner-workings of the American Government will want to see this film, as well as anybody with an interest in journalism.  Simply put, this film is excellent.My Rating:  10/10",10,1,1,29 May 2000
