Howl's Moving Castle," Whimiscal wizardry and war drama
","After the Oscar-winning Sprited Away by Hayou Miyazaki, the skates are high for his next animated feature. His adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' 2001 book Howl's Moving Castle is no doubt an unrivaled animated feature featuring sorcery and wizards against the backdrop of war and a sweet romance.While the animation is lively and the effects are stunning, the whimsical adaptation suffered from too much layering of plot. There may be occasions where one may be lost in the plot. Though this definitely does not affect my enjoyment of the movie, I thought it would have benefited from better continuity. I have not read the original book but it's surely not an easy task to bring a book to life through the painstaking process of animating every single frame.",8,6,9,5 March 2005
Madagascar," Nature vs Nuture?
","Madagascar features a bunch of animals, a lion, a zebra, a hippo and a giraffe specifically who are well-fed and cared for in a city centre zoo in New York. By day, there are stars of the zoo, performing over-the-top stunts and attracting the crowd. That was until the 10th birthday of Marty the zebra when he decided to do something with his life by living his dream of being back in the wilderness. Inspired by a few escaping penguins, he too left for Central Park station and by some strange twist of fate, all of them landed on Madagascar.Like Shark Tale, the story borders on being a shallow tale. Some of the scenes like the animals taking the city subway and roaming the streets are just simply incredulous. Dialogs are sometimes banal or slapstick, although I must say the star of the voice overs must be Chris Rock who brings his comedic persona into the character of Marty.The scene where Marty and Alex meet on the beach after a near-shipwreck set against the Vangeli's Chariots of Fire is simply cheesy while the one with Alex mimicking the famous rose-dropping in American Beauty was top-notch.In the end, I am not too sure if they are advocating that animals should be kept in captivity so that they don't have to face the adverse conditions of the wilderness or we should celebrate the camaraderie between different spiecesthough the thought of a carnivorous animal thinking twice before savouring its prey in the wild is rather unthinkable. Perhaps you have to decide for yourself.Well, there's still good - the music in the feature, especially the Ali G remake of Reel to Real's I Like To Movie It, does bring Madagscar out of its doldrums at the right time.",6,0,0,28 May 2005
Brokeback Mountain," The Cold Harsh Mountain
","Brokeback Mountain Directed by Lee Ang Screenplay adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana Based on the short story by Annie ProulxStarring Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway & Michelle WilliamsHaving read the original short story by Proulx a few years ago, I was surprised by how well a tale of love between two cowboys set against a panoramic Wyoming backdrop was told. When I learned that the 60-page short story would become a film directed by celebrated director Lee Ang, I hoped it would be made soon.By now, most people would have associated Brokeback Mountain with gay forbidden love. The truth is, Brokeback Mountain is just a very simple tale of arduous love and anyone with an ounce of emotion should watch.The union of director Lee Ang, scriptwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and the cast results in one of the most exquisite and endearing films made in the last few years.Lee Ang possesses the talent for slow, intricate and subtle film direction. He pays attention to almost every aspect from simple small gestures to complex emotional strife set against the magnificent mountain view.McMurtry and Ossana also adapted the story faithfully except for the fact that the two male leads were originally much less desirable than Ledger and Gyllenhaal with bucked-tooth and stocky bodies.The assembled cast is the third link which leads the film to flight. Heath Ledger, the stoic straight-man type is caught unexpectedly in a tangled web of emotions for a fellow cowboy, something that had never crossed his less-than-queer mind. A man of few words, Ledger plays Ennis to perfection when he displays the inner turmoil that Ennis encountered trying to live his life the way it is and learning to love Jack. Every time Ledger breaks down and cries in the film, it's when you'll feel him.Jake Gyllenhaal is the hopeful companion who prays for the day that the union could yield the type of permanence he so craved for instead of 'one or two of high-altitude f**ks once or twice in a year.' And he waited for 20 years until the audience shares his anguish and unfulfilled yearnings by the time he lashed out on what they ever have left is Brokeback Mountain.Michelle Williams plays the silent, long-suffering wife who witnessed the earth-shattering and ultimately heartbreaking kiss shared between Ennis and Jack after 4 years of separation. Williams is exceptionally sorrowful, swallowing her unspoken hurt until she could hold it no more that she wanted to hear the truth out of Ennis' mouth years after her remarriage. Williams' acting prowess is certainly validated by the expression she showed at the instance of that unexpected kiss and the heart-wrenching exchange with Ledger.Anne Hathaway plays a rich girl whose expertise is in making money not relationships. Given her short screen time, her change from a brash rich girl to a high-society career woman and finally a emotionless and grieving widow expands her acting abilities beyond her impish Princess Diary-self.Many unions, liaisons and break-ups later, Brokeback Mountain emerges as a tragic yet bittersweet and endearing tale of love between four suffering people afflicted with varying degrees of attachment but all not willing to let go. To me, this suffices as more than a gay cowboy story. To enjoy Brokeback Mountain, an open mind and eyes are definitely pre-requisites. (A+)",9,26,30,18 February 2006
Crash," Beauty collision
","I just had a delectable visual and mental treat from Paul Haggis. Crash, which opened in theaters on Thursaday, is a well-crafted story. From the opening scene of a car collision, the film unfolds to weave several stories to form an intricate web of inter-related events involving the beautifully drawn characters. The basis of the story might have been racial discrimination and stereotyping but beneath this surface, it's really an emotionally-charged collision of unearthed feelings, contradictive thoughts and the emotional freedom that people sometimes deny themselves by refusing to confront reality. There's a couple of heart wrenching scenes in the film too.Although most of the actors have minimal screen time due to the various stories, the acting is consummate. Don Cheadle is shaping to be a great character actor as his display of emotions is so intense that you feel him. Ludicrous, the rapper (whose music I couldn't care less), also shows promise in his big screen debut.For me, I identify most with Sandra Bullock's character, a heavily repressed and unhappy socialite who was robbed at gunpoint with her husband (Brendan Fraser). When her character said, 'I am upset but it's not because of the carjack. I wake up feeling like this every morning. I am angry but I don't know why.' And when she falls off the stairs shortly after, only to arrive at the realization of the people and things that matter most.I am deeply surprised by how well the little stories intertwine so flawlessly to present a thought-provoking film. Certainly one of my three favorite movies of 2005 following Closer and Sommersturm (Summer Storm). I urge everyone to see Paul Haggis' Crash and experience 2 hours of feeling again.",7,0,4,16 July 2005
Closer," Real love?
","Closer is possibly the most accurate and realistic depiction of modern love. The notion and true value of love in today's context is lost among a sea of infidelity, deception, lust, betrayal, jealously, cynicism, technology and vindication.Despite being set in slightly surreal environments such as a photo exhibition and strip clubs, the writers and actors have successfully conveyed the emotions that run through typically dysfunctional relationships. In the end, the people involved in the web are either very certain of their own feelings finally or are so overwhelmed with rage that they become vindictive. The movie also explores the line between truth and lie; the difference each makes to a relationship and the consequence one has to bear for his/her actions.Julia Roberts hasn't got much for her role to begin with, but she shows a certain delicateness, straddling between guilt and liberty with her role that makes a performance that is sufficiently pleasurable. Natalie Portman is stunning with middling traces of girlish vulnerability and womanly salacity. Jude Law packs both a cold yet emotive performance as a cheating boyfriend and later a desperate man stuck nowhere in both relationships. A performance good enough to warrant for an Oscar nod (but none sadly). The most powerful performance must come from Clive Owen who starred in the original play. He's the one who's drawn into a destructive relationship with Roberts and turns sinister when trying to win her back through a series of confrontations and psychological manoeuvers. All in all, a stellar cast and choice performances. (PS: Do check out the cybersex chat between Owen and Law) So, is love lost really lost? Is the sudden change of hearts actually beyond one's reasonable control? Find out in Closer, then again you might never actually.",9,1,1,19 February 2005
Before Sunset," Love before the sun sets
","Before Sunset isn't only the underrated and hidden gem of Richard Linklater but also that of 2004. The simple reason is that this has to be one of the best movies of this year. The movie depended very much on Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and their compelling chemistry is unmistakable. From the time they left the book store till the time they ended in Celine's apartment, it's 90 minutes of witty conversation that covered a wide range of topics from books to environmental issues to politics to love and life. There was never a dull moment because there's so much realism and bittersweetness in the recounting of that fateful night 9 years ago. And it's this night that had caused two long-lost people separated by time and distance to rediscover the love they had always had for each other despite the changes to their lives in those 9 years.Julie Delpy puts up a good job as Celine whose love life had never been smooth but still held deep love for her one night companion 9 years ago from which her memory could never erase. Her display of emotions are spectacular, culminating in the scene where she emulates a late famous singer's moves while Ethan Hawke was watching her. Her heartfelt rendition of the original song Waltz for a Night must have been the highlight of the entire movie.Ethan Hawke has displayed much maturity since Sunrise and playes a guy trapped in a loveless marriage whose yearning for Celine is so strong. When he cast his eyes on Celine, it's almost as if he had said so much to her when no words were even spoken. It's that look that transcends time and space. In the end, the movie isn't your typical romantic story but achieves its aim to touch one deep inside and ask oneself if one had ever known love like that. It doesn't matter how long one might have known someone but it's really the power of the being connected to someone wherever the person is that makes the difference. It's about re-living and -capturing that moment that will potentially fulfill an unended desire, knowing that without this person, your life will never be whole. That's what love should really be, perhaps. And yes, all these achieved without any sex. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Not just once. Each viewing yields a different interpretation.",9,0,2,24 November 2004
Inside Man," Perfect insight
","Spike Lee's Inside Man may seem like just another cop and robber story until you see the story unravel on screen. Robber Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) has planned a perfect heist that has put career cop Keith Frazier in a fix. Amidst intense negotiation between the two, power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) enters the picture proving herself to be a better negotiator than Fraizer. But everyone has their motives and the interlocking puzzle gets more complex. As the story unfolds, each turn becomes more unpredictable.Clive Owen is excellent witty robber who's outpacing everyone at every opportunity. Displaying a level of cool collectedness, Owen was convincing as the potentially violent criminal with a broader agenda in mind. Denzel Washington turns in an equally sublime performance playing the detective who's trying to serve justice while battling investigation for corruption. Detecive Fraizer's urgency in taking Russell to task is well portrayed by Washington.Jodie Foster's Medeline White may just play a supporting role but it's no doubt that the actress can handle any role with aplomb. Her character's brimming with calm confidence trying to secure a deal with the robber while enriching her own pockets.Spike Lee's Inside Man is an exciting thrillers with non-stop action and suspense. It cleverly plays out and eventually leaves the audience dazzled and in awe. (A)",9,2,3,7 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Anagrams and Symbols
","Da Vinci Code when viewed strictly on its own merit worked flawlessly as a well-executed mystery thriller. There's mind-boggling suspense, unexplained theories and unresolved mysteries within the span of the film's 150 minutes.However, when it comes to the subject material, staunch Christians were riled no end by Dan Brown's fiction, calling them blasphemous lies. The published book certainly didn't quite create a stir back in 2003. Yes, the thing is, in a bid to confine the movie to a reasonable 150 minutes on screen, part of the intriguing plot in print was left out, making viewers who haven't read the book beforehand guess more than they should.Dan Brown's postulations were taken too seriously by some quarters. He never really claimed that they were true but merely conjectures based on his research or understanding of the faith.Now, the acting. I am generally pleased with the performances by the cast despite criticisms that Tom Hanks didn't look the part of the character David Langdon in the book. Well, I thought he did well. After all, Hanks gives the character of the symbologist his own flavor, his facial expressions conveyed a sense of urgency in solving the mystery and clearing his name.Audrey Tautou who plays professional cryptographer Sophie Neuve is perhaps the only likable character throughout the show. The role might not demand much of her as the sidekick of Hanks' Langdon but Tautou gives an adequate performance coming to terms with her grandfather's death and discovering her true identity.Ian McKellen's over-zealous Sir Leigh Teabing adds to the mystery when Langdon and Neuve turns up at his door seeking for help to unravel the hidden truth. McKellen's acting prowess is undoubtedly splendid.Paul Bettany's in his role as the obsessed and self-mutilating-in-the-name-of-god Silas was scene-stealing (he was almost unrecognizable). The conviction in his eyes and behaviour would be one of the highs of the movie as he seeks to further the cause of the religion.My only disappointment was with Jean Reno. But again, his role was severely limited so we could only see his Opus Dei character Captain Fache pull a long face and all the stops at trying to foil Langdon's and Neuve's plans at every juncture.No one should really complain at the adequacy of The Da Vinci Code as a functioning thriller despite some of Dan Brown's more ludicrous assertions. After all, we must remember this is fiction not theology. The way to enjoy the Da Vinci Code on screen is to watch it with a free and unprejudiced mind. (B+)",7,5,9,22 May 2006
