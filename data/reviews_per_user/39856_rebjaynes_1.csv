Blade Runner 2049," very bad movie...violent, sexist, plot less, humorless
","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. 2 disclaimers-1) science fiction of this type is not my thing, and 2) I like intelligent films, or at least acceptably so, or clever. This film had no plot, and what it had was stupid. 'Let's name him Joe!' As in GIJoe? Twice we heard the line - 'to die for one's beliefs is the most human thing' - so suicide bombers are the most human? Getting smashed in the face left the hero without a mark, and getting stabbed didn't slow him down.. or was that because he wasn't human after all. Oh dear.Violence was supposed to keep us awake when the roaring music and car crashes didn't. The female 'characters' and women's portrayals were sexist stereotypes. Between crashes was boring too. Finally Harrison Ford appears - only to play a bit part and the ending made no sense - since the big-shots would have known it was the one they were looking for.Waay too long. So bad it was funny.",2,2,10,17 October 2017
