The Blair Witch Project," scariest movie ever
","maybe its cuz im young. maybe i have an impressionable mind. maybe its just because i dont like being in the woods at night anyway. or maybe its because i have a really strong imagination. whatever the reason, i thought this was the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life. for some reason, i have found people few and far between who share my enthusiasm. this makes me sad. yes, it was lacking in all the run-chase-stab-blood-run-stab-blood etc thing most people find 'scary' these days. i mean, yeah, okay a killer in a scary mask hunting you down, that is a little scary. but being in the woods, with only 2 other people, hearing footsteps and voices and finding things that werent there before when there is NO ONE ELSE IN THE WOODS seems to be more scary to me. because it could be anything hunting you down. absolutely anything.",Null,0,2,3 December 2002
