The Avengers," Best superhero movie ever?
","I'm not sure what everyone else thought about this film. I was worried, really worried. It just seemed that the studio was rushing it through.I watched it as soon as it came out, before I had even read any reviews and I have to say that so far, it's in my top 5 films of the year, easily.Joss Whedon has done a fantastic job. Each Avenger is given a good amount of time on screen with Iron Man having the lions share. The dialogue is snappy and all the actors do a great job with the script. Mark Ruffalo does a superb turn as Dr Banner as does Tom Hiddlestone as Loki (who clearly likes being the bad guy). In fact there is not one thing I could say is wrong with this film.There are a few good laughs in this as well, 2 of the best come from the Hulk. I wont spoil it for you but one of them I actually laughed out loud on (and I very rarely laugh out loud in the cinema).Overall, this is a fantastic film. One that you could watch even if you only had a small understanding of the Marvel universe. If like me though you are a Marvel fan and read the comics, you will enjoy all the subtle references in the film as well as all the action.Go see it. You wont regret it.",9,1,4,29 April 2012
