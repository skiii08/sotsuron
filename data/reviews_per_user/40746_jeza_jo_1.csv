Walk the Line," Mesmerising
","This is the first time I've actually commented on a movie here but the movie left me mesmerized and I felt the need to share my views.You live through the joys and internal misery of The Man in Black and the journey is perfected with the superb acting, beautiful music (and I was not a fan of country music) and the whole story - the highs and lows of his musical success, his battle with alcohol and pain-killer addiction and the great love between he and June Carter.Joaquin and Reese are absolutely amazing in this movie - they are so convincing in their roles that you actually feel a special connection between the lead stars. The supporting cast only make this movie even better.If you liked 'Ray' or 'Elvis', you'll love Walk the Line ...",9,2,4,31 January 2006
