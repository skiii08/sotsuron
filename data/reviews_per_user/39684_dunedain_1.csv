Casablanca," The beginning of a legend
","'Casablanca' is one of those films that makes cinema so great. Maybe all has been said about this masterpiece, but is for me an honour to be able to comment something. First of all, it was filmed as 'Citizen Kane', that's it, total anarchy during the shooting: no script, everiday was shooted something that no one knew the day before and classical film stars appear in it. And though this enviroment, so annoying, such a masterwork appeared. It is not only a film, it is 'the' film. The eighth time I enjoyed it I really moved myself. Sorry 'bout my english (quite grim), but my soul obliged me to say what it feels. So, play it Sam, play it for all time sake...",10,1,1,28 May 2000
