3:10 to Yuma," Horay for the return of the western
","If, like me, you were fed up watching a generation of fifth-rate westerns that were not fit to shoe the getaway horses of their predecessors from the 1950s-70s, then this film is a breath of fresh air.I was dubious despite the great reviews as remakes of great films like the 57 version of 3.10 tend to be dire and leave me like Colonel Kurtz muttering 'The horror... the horror...' but this one was better than the original.It worked on several levels. Most importantly it was an express train of events - not just meaningless fireworks, but action leading to another action and another. But it also worked as a meditation on what happens if responsibility to your conscience and your loved ones want to go in two different directions. Much has been said about the excellent cast. Crowe in particular is icily impressive and the bible-quoting baddie. Best of all, it manages to be gripping without taking itself too seriously - it always has a heart as well as a head.I've not enjoyed a western this much since The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Hats off to the makers.",9,2,4,10 November 2007
