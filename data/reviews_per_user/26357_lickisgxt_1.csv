Iron Man 3," An enjoyable film that in the end will leave you with a big: 'Thats it?'
","Spoiler free review:Its not really worth going much into detail, after all this movie follows the classic RDJ - Stark formula. For me and the audience, it was just as good as it was first presented in Iron Man 1. It keeps you entertained along the movie, some good laughs here and there, cool tech, Decent action sequences, etc. You can't really hate the character, his quirks and gadgets regardless of the plot.The trailer and the first part of the movie sets you in a dark atmosphere not seen and experienced in the 2 previous installments. You know that very soon things will get serious and bad for our main characters, the downfall is imminent. But then as the movie progresses, one keeps expecting some real trouble; a ruthless, merciless and powerful villain to reign over the story...And it happens of course, (without revealing anything), it just that is really nothing special, really. The plot ends being flat and its just as rewarding as Iron Man 2 plot. Positive aspects: -New tech and gadgets: It is shown and comes across the story in unpredictable moments and ways. Really fun -I liked the soundtrack, it gave the movie more depth and feeling. I think it was better than previous installments, only it got repetitive at the end of the movie -A+ visuals and effects -Bad ass Suits and actionsNegative: -A lot of the plot aspects are left behind mid film. Some of them are poorly handled and explained and are just thrown or taken out of nowhere to keep up the pace of the film -villain does not delivers 100%: A superhero movie is not only about the main hero, the villain is just as important.Comic reader or not, it will be fun film. Just don't expect anything big that will leave you talking and thinking about the matter for a couple of weeks. When you walk out of theater you will be pleased for sure, the movie is worth it after all. It just that its not what many expected and it will just leave you with a big: 'Thats it?",6,169,338,28 April 2013
