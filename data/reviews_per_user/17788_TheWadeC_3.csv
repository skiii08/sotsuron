Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The funniest film ever made.
","This film, This is, Well, It is a film, what did you think it was? This film is a hilarious piece of work (unlike that POS Bruno). Borat is one of the funniest characters in history (counting films, tv shows, songs, plays, history, whatever you could think). You end up loving Borat and his character. I was in pain laughing at this. This film is just flat-out funny, Even if you don't get the satire, You can still enjoy it. This film however, will divide audiences. On one hand, You may be freaking disgusted, or you may fall in love with the satire. You may love it, You may hate it. This film is a smart one, one of the smartest films ever made, Sacha Baren Cohen is an amazing actor. You truly believe Borat to be a real person. I certainly wasn't expecting anything when I found 7 copies at Dollar Tree. I thought 'This looks dumb. Maybe it'll be funny!' So, I bought it, because I wanted to finally get a copy since I am a collector of DVDs and I heard it was a freaking masterpiece. Well, That isn't wrong, It is a masterpiece. Borat without a doubt, it the ultimate comedy. Watch it. Go to that piracy website and see it. Just see it.",8,0,1,29 March 2020
World War Z," The excellent Zombie-Black-Comedy we've been needing.
","Yeah, I get it, 'This isn't a comedy! Blah-blah-blah!'Well, The thing about it is, This is how it feels by the end. With Brad Pitt spazzing out on a hospital bed screaming 'WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!' sounding like Nic Cage and a hilarious scene where his wife calls him in the middle of him trying to get past zombies by being quiet. That's not very quiet, huh?There's a lot of unexpected hilarious moments also, like a cop screaming at Brad Pitt's family in a car before he's RAMMED INTO BY A SEMI-TRUCK. WTF? It's excellently darkly comedic in the acting too. There's a lot of over-the-top acting here too. Not as good as Nic Cage, but I mean, Did anyone expect it to be? No, The answer is no.
If we get to the fine details of the acting (what did that mean?), Well, OH BOY. The wife's actress Mireille Enos seems like she's here for fun (she's constantly smiling and sounding happy-go-lucky-go), She doesn't seem like a bad person, It just doesn't work. Maybe we should've got someone else, I dunno, Maybe Jenna Fischer? Sandra Bullock (wait, no)? Julia Roberts (maybe not)? I kinda could see Lena Heady in the role too actually. Any other actress may have been able to pull off the role better, It's just that the direction that Enos decides to go into (her character is pretty stupid too) doesn't really fit the tone, but it certainly fits the character (what I'm saying is, the tone of her acting isn't very great and that fits her character).Brad Pitt is obviously not that bad, but at the same time it kinda makes me wonder, If it wasn't for his company getting the rights for the film, Would he of been in the film? I kinda wish someone else would've been cast. However, Brad Pitt does indeed fit into the film well.If we talk about the comedy again, IT'S EVERYWHERE. A girl gets her hand chopped off and there's no blood! Even with blood, with how random the chop is, it's still hilarious! The soldier characters constantly spout out one-liners that are either so dumb/bad that you can't help but laugh out loud, or so cringe that it makes you chuckle inside.The zombies are so over-the-top that if you don't laugh, I'll question you. The characters, while seeming to be cliche, I don't mind. The cliches kinda work and make the film feel even more like a black-comedy. I can't praise this film enough, It's hilarious. Plus, The whole zombie-twist, Oh boy, It's so dumb that it's hilarious!While this film isn't a so bad it's good film at all and it's just a overall great Dark Comedy, You will either love or hate this film.Maybe you'll freaking hate it, Maybe you'll freaking love it, Whatever you think of it, It's hilarious.",7,0,0,19 April 2020
Shrek 2," One of the best films ever made, Yes, I mean that.
","The first Shrek movie is one of the worst films ever made compared to this film. This film takes everything from Shrek 1, and does it better by 42069x. That is really all I can say, It deserved the oscar for best Animated Picture, but the oscars are retarded (Parasite did deserve best picture in 2020 though) so yeah lol. This film will amaze anyone who will watch it, Watch it with your cat, your dog, your ghost of the slave that the former person who lived in the house owned, your mom, your dad, your imaginary friend, Watch this ASAP. And Shrek the Third is amazing too, fight me.",10,1,2,6 March 2020
