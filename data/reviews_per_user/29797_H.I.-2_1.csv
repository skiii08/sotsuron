The Blair Witch Project," A Film that is More than the Sum of its Parts
","I have heard critics discount this movie as a gimmick flick but that could not be further from the truth.  The entire film is shot by the characters (not the actors).  The first person style of the film completely draws the audience in, forcing them to identify with the characters.  This isn't one of those horror movies that's full of those cheap scares where things jump out and surprise you.  The film is comprised of nothing but honest to god tension that builds and builds.  It's worth seeing for the last fifteen minutes alone.  I was so scared, I wanted to get up and walk out of the theater but I couldn't because I was so engrossed in the movie.  The Blair Witch Project is an absolute must see.  It's one of those movies that you have to see in the theater and the closer you sit to the front, the better.",10,1,2,22 July 1999
