Vertigo," Very intriguing Hitchcock film!
","Hitchcock's Vertigo has been called one of his greatest films, and it definitely is (in his top 5, in my opinion). The story is gripping, the performances are very good, the setting and style and photography are as well. There were moments of suspense, fear, humor and romance.James Stewart, who has been in a large number of Hitch's flicks, does a great job here portraying a man tortured by his unsolvable fear of heights, leading to vertigo. The beautiful Kim Novak, playing Trudy and 'Madeleine', is excellent as well. She is very convincing, but I must say that her eyebrows are worthy of Maleficent. They were so arched it was distracting.The twist at the end is quite good as well, but one thing I did not like was the way she died. She was frightened by the sudden appearance of a nun and she fell. I felt it should have been something a bit more dramatic that led her to fall.However, the movie is iconic and deservedly so. It is one of the best films out there.",9,2,3,25 January 2016
A Star Is Born," The most overrated movie in a long time
","Yes, Gaga is a good singer, yes her performance is fine, but the amount of hype surrounding this movie is unfathomable. It is the FOURTH adaptation of this movie, so nothing that special about it. I would have loved Bradley Cooper's performance if I could understand a single word he was saying; he mumbled his sentences in a very annoying and pretentious way.
Gaga is fine but looks plastic. Her performance is in no way deserving of any award wins, in my humble opinion. The way she sang 'La Vie en Rose' was downright embarrassing. The plot was also somewhat predictable. Cooper's suicide scene was not done very well and the shaky camera moments were distracting.
That being said, the overall acting was good, and Sam Elliot is a good actor often overlooked. The songs were quite enjoyable; that is the area where Gaga truly shines. Some of the scenes were touching, etc.
Overall, predictable, overrated movie with some good moments.",5,4,8,7 January 2019
Knives Out," Funny, smart and engrossing
","Being a big fan of mystery novels and films, I was really looking forward to watching this movie, and was not at all disappointed!
While set in modern times, the film has a really timeless feel to it, similar to the stories by Agatha Christie. While the formula is familiar; rich dysfunctional family living in a big mansion, all with secrets to hide, the twists and turns are quite surprising.
The entire experience is engrossing, and, while the story did not quite go where I initially expected, the ending was great, and actually smart. The whole thing was also really funny at times, adding to the whole entertainment value of murder mysteries.
Daniel Craig, playing detective Benoit Blanc, really goes to town on his role, with a southern 'accent' I never really heard before. Ana de Armas really shines in this movie as well, and the ensemble of great actors playing the eccentric family members all made their screen time memorable.
I highly recommend this movie.",9,3,10,30 November 2019
American Sniper," Boring, Biased Trash
","This movie was just bad. Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, was so unlikeable and stuck-up and such a d*ck that I was actually hoping he would get shot. It dragged on and on and was just extremely tiresome and boring towards the end. The directing is nothing special and Bradley Cooper's performance did not at all impress. It is extremely biased and, as usual, shows that Americans are always the heroes and that all Arab Muslims are murderers, instead of telling people there is good and bad in every single society in the world. It showed very little of Kyle's training and how he got to be nicknamed 'legend'. It quickly skipped from one part to the next and his post-traumatic stress syndrome was not elaborated. His death in the end was really expected and ironic. This does not deserve a single Academy Award nomination let alone best picture.",1,22,49,3 February 2015
Inside Out," Fun and heart-warming
","Inside Out proved to be a really good animated film, worthy of the praise it has received. It is fun for all the family, heart-warming and has great messages.The story is about Riley, an 11-year-old girl who is saddened when she leaves Minnesota with her parents and moves to San Francisco. The core emotions in her mind, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust also go through the challenge with her, mainly Joy and Sadness. The others just serve as comical relief. Joy and Sadness embark on a journey trying to help Riley after her emotions are confused and she decides to run away. They try to maintain her sense of family and friendship and her fun-loving spirit.The movie sends a very important message to the audience, which is the importance of sadness, which can strengthen bonds and help others finally admit to their worries and troubles, and presents it in a fun way.The animation is beautiful; the voice cast did a wonderful job, especially Amy Poehler. This is not the very best Pixar, but is definitely in their top films yet.",8,3,25,22 January 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Satisfying conclusion, too long
","In all honesty I enjoyed Endgame more than Infinity War, which gave me a headache when I watched it last year.
The performances here are quite good, with RDJ, Johansson, Evans and Hemsworth at their very best. The cinematography and visual effects are, of course, fantastic. The effects of Infinity War events on the different characters was cool to watch, and their dynamics and interactions together were quite good too. The ending was quite powerful, and a poetic end to an era, with the heroic sacrifices of Iron Man and Black Widow.
However, the movie was WAY too long and dragged a lot in the middle. Some parts could have easily been shortened or edited out completely without affecting the story line. Also, some of the plot points and details of the story are very complicated and difficult to keep up with or understand without asking a hundred questions.
All in all, while a half-time break is necessary, Endgame was a satisfying and powerful end to this important era of the MCU.",7,1,2,31 July 2019
The Favourite," Weird film that had potential
","Well, I do not really know where to start. First of all, the performances of the three leads and their interactions are fantastic. They really are the best thing about this movie. Between them, though, Olivia Colman definitely shined brightest. That however, does not mean that any of these characters were even remotely likable, or had any redeeming qualities. Queen Anne, while she delivered some memorable funny lines, was completely out of her mind. The Weisz character was very unpleasant, domineering and condescending, while the Stone character was nothing less than a snake; cunning, manipulative, and quite evil.
The rest of the film was a bit baffling. There is always an attempt for a story arc that never really comes through. Is it the sad life of a troubled and childish queen? No. Is it about the deep and complex relationship between two people who care about each other (Colman and Weisz)? No. Is it about an impoverished young woman who wants to finally amount to something and gain back her rights as someone of good family? Again, no. The story attempts to mix all of these elements, and the result is a weird, somewhat incoherent and eventually boring mess. The ending was unbelievably underwhelming. The very strong language was strange and out of place in this setting.
The fish-eye camera was completely unnecessary, and pretentious if I might add, while the film also looked very dark. The costumes and production design were great, as were the hair and makeup. The music was really annoying and awkwardly placed.
While the Queen did have some humorous moments and lines, this is certainly NOT a comedy.
All in all, with a definite story arc, this film could have had potential, but ultimately a somewhat incapable director turned the concept into a mess.",5,1,4,17 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What was the point?
","In an era of never-ending franchises and superhero movies, watching something original, something that is pure film, is a breath of fresh air. It is also a rarity. However, if being original is throwing 100 ideas into a blender and releasing the mess for the audience's privilege, then I'd stick with the never-ending MCU movies.
Honestly, throw in a buddy comedy element, the washed-up has-been actor wanting to survive storyline, obnoxious closeups of dirty feet, lots and lots (and LOTS) of driving, an old Hollywood backdrop and a bit of violence, and you get ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'.
What compelled me to give it five stars is the admittedly good acting, the chemistry between the two leads, the beautiful cinematography and some genuinely funny individual moments, all which qualified for some form of entertainment.
However, the rest of the movie is a bizarre piece of wishful thinking, that is not at all relevant to the main characters.
Margot Robbie was good with the very little that she was given, but her character could not have been more pointless, due to the ending where history has been changed and no harm came to her.
There was honestly no point to the whole story, and while I appreciate films that try to do something new, at least have a coherent story that goes somewhere. This does not. Random appearances of big names like Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Bruce Dern, Luke Perry, Dakota Fanning, etc. just add to the weirdness of the whole movie, and the pointlessness as well.
Way too much time is wasted while the DiCaprio character is scene shooting some cheap cowboy show, and the film easily could have been a lot shorter, but Tarantino insists on taking his time in showing us...nothing.
The violence at the end was rather fun to watch, but the entire movie leading up to it was meaningless.
I can almost guarantee that, if not for the name of Tarantino and the glamour of the stars, this movie would have been crapped on all over.",5,10,15,15 August 2019
The Lion King," Somewhat Lifeless
","The Lion King is without a doubt one of the greatest animated films of all time ( if not THE greatest). It was already flawless, and so there was no reason whatsoever to remake it, especially if there is nothing new to be added to the story.
The visuals are breathtaking and unsurpassed, but the very realistic looking animals look rather awkward when they talk and show no emotion whatsoever, something that has been achieved exceptionally in 2D animation.
The voice cast in general is fine, but no one really stands out.
It is the same story exactly, but the magic is not there.",6,4,9,18 July 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Overrated
","To start with, the film has excellent visual effects and the action sequences were very good. The production design kind of looked like the 60s, but that's not really a problem. I felt like there was nothing really new here, the same story-lines are repeated in these Marvel films, so it does not have a lot to make it unique or so different from other Sci-Fi films, and it is really strange to me how so many people loved it. Also, apart from Groot (who was just awesome), I did not find any of the other characters very likable, especially Chris Pratt. Zoe Saldana was the clichéd bad-ass action heroine who is more serious than the goofy male hero.However, the story was gripping a lot of the time, and I have to repeat how amazing the visual effects were; it was just visually dazzling. But I also had a problem with how bad the skin makeup looked on the colorful characters (Zoe Saldana, her sister, the villain and others). All in all, the film was fun to watch and has great visuals, but I found it overrated.",5,7,12,2 January 2016
Psycho," Easily the best
","This film belongs with those movies that are set aside from others; those that will never be forgotten. Its impact is overwhelming and its immortality is inevitable. It is simply Hitchcock's best, as it is different from his previous films (which were all excellent) in suspense. It is more quiet, more gritty and is set in a remote area in the US. This horror film has meaning and underneath the gore and horror there is something deep and poetic; unlike today's films that are filled with blood, gore and not much more. The idea itself sends chills down your spine.The performances are fabulous. A crime was committed in not awarding the Best Actor Oscar to Anthony Perkins, who gave a breathtaking and blood-curdling performance that grew to become iconic. Janet Leigh was magnificent as well. Hitchcock's incomparable directing and story-telling abilities made this film what it is , and the technical effects also help build up the suspense. Who can forget the infamous shower scene and its impact on film-making and suspense movies, where (in my opinion), the finest editing was ever performed in film. I actually believed that the knife was penetrating Marion's body.The famous score by Bernard Herrmann tripled the movie's impact and was absolutely phenomenal, from the quiet suspenseful opening shot to the romantic theme, to the stolen money and the running away, and finally to the motel, where a quiet and creepy theme takes over, and then, of course, the shrieking violins of the murder sequences of the big reveal at the end. All of these factors helped in making PSYCHO one of the greatest movies ever made.10/10",10,2,3,4 May 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Action-packed, funny and original!
","I found Edge of Tomorrow to be highly enjoyable due to many different aspects that make it a great film. It was action-packed, and the action was quite good and intense, the visuals were masterful, especially the alpha and omega aliens, etc. It was quite funny as well, with Tom Cruise playing this goof ball who has no business being in the military yet has to face this challenge, and his encounters with the J-Squad and his superior are quite humorous, as well as the number of times the day is repeated. The amount of times he dies and comes back to life is also a hilarious sequence. I must say that this is probably the only non-Ethan Hunt role Cruise has played that I liked; I don't generally like him as an actor but here he really does a great job. Emily Blunt was fantastic as well; she's a great female character and is absolutely lovely. The rest of the cast were great as well. The story-line was great and original; much more original than the madly overrated 'Guardians of the Galaxy', and twice as enjoyable. All in all, a great film!",9,0,2,10 January 2016
Jaws," A Masterpiece
","A truly amazing masterpiece, and rightfully considered as one of the greatest films ever made! Perfect cast, perfect timing, perfect plot, and, of course, one of the greatest musical scores ever written for a movie! This film builds up the anxiety in your body with every shark attack and every occurrence. The visuals are also great, considering the time this movie was made. Steven Spielberg is a genius director. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are all great and make a great screen ensemble. I would recommend this film to anyone (not a child) who loves some gore. This classic sinks its teeth into you and leaves the scar for a long, long time.10/10",10,2,6,29 May 2014
Lucy," Not that good
","'Lucy' may be worth a watch to see Scarlett Johansson kick some butt and stand around looking sexy and voluptuous, but it feels extremely rushed and the storyline skips from one part to the other without mercy. The premise may be interesting, but I found the story to be quite dumb. The concept itself did not make real sense, and it was almost IMPOSSIBLE to care about any of the characters involved. Lucy's character was not at all nice, nor relatable to anyone. She's just a sexy mean butt-kicking machine. The action sequences were not really thrilling as one would expect from a big-budget action movie, and the ending when she became literally everywhere made no sense and was annoying to say the least. It's just another popcorn flick gone wrong, and it is evident that Luc Besson used only 10% of his creativity to come up with this (joke intended). All in all, you may want to watch it if you are a fan of ScarJo, but if you want to watch something exciting, avoid it.",3,0,3,20 January 2015
Unbroken," Excellent!
","After reading some of the mixed critical reactions for Unbroken, I did not know what to expect. It was the same with Maleficent, which I ended up loving. The theater was about half- full. First of all, the cinematography was masterful, as one would expect from Roger Deakins. The visual effects were excellent and the coloring, sets and design, etc. were all perfect for the film. I found the story to be extremely involving and was 100% focused on what happened on the screen. Jack O'Connell is an extremely talented young actor and was the right choice for this role. All performances were great. In only her second feature film as director, Angelina Jolie did an extremely impressive job of putting the story together. She has this 'classic' method as if you are watching a Hollywood classic film. And I also found it great that for once, I am watching a 'respectful' film without excessive sex and language. This showed the characters to be more of the 'gentleman' type, which I respect. The shots of the real 80-year-old Louis running in Japan showed that it is never too late to fulfill anything and I have great respect for this man. It is also a moving film, especially the scene where he contacts his family through radio in the U.S. Also the torture scenes were very upsetting and felt very real. Some of my personal favorite moments from the film were when they were on the raft in the middle of the Pacific struggling to survive. I thought these scenes were marvelously done. All in all, an excellent film and cinematic experience.",10,6,14,25 January 2015
Godzilla," Quite disappointing
","This movie's title is misleading, because Godzilla basically makes a cameo only. The movie drags and drags and just when things start to get interesting (action sequences, fight scenes), it cuts back to the boring human story-line. Also, the awesome Bryan Cranston is killed not too long into the movie. He was definitely the best actor and most interesting human character, but, of course, the hero is his boring son, who is not that great of a character essentially. Godzilla looks awesome, and spews this great powerful energy but doesn't use it much, and a long time is spent just watching him swim towards and away from the town, with the military following him. Honestly, the MUTOs have a lot more screen time than Godzilla, who this movie is supposed to be about. A lot of time is spent in the dark, frustrating the audience even more and making the film even longer. There was of course the cliché of the wife and kid in trouble, who are characters not worth caring about. Godzilla ends up the savior of the town, which is okay. The film is visually stunning, so there's a plus. This should not have been called Godzilla, it should have been another creature to save the day, because the MUTOs are basically the main monsters here. All in all, a visually stunning movie that was extremely disappointing.",2,4,5,10 January 2016
The Birds," Exceptional movie!
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'THE BIRDS' is his last real masterpiece. It was released three years after the colossal effect of PSYCHO on audiences. This movie is different; it is Hitchcock's 'creature feature', yet the creatures in this film are not vicious monsters; they're birds: seagulls, sparrows, crows, etc. This movie is exceptional and stands out because the mystery element is abundant; we are not given any specific reasons as why the birds are acting the way they are, nor what happens in the end. We just see the main characters driving away with a shocking amount of birds surrounding them. This unique storytelling ability (which would definitely fail if handled in other ways with less remarkable directors) is very typical of the master of suspense.Tippi Hedren plays the lovely heroine, Melanie, a socialite who is smitten with a young lawyer. The story involves the two of them, his mother and sister. Other characters include an unfortunate schoolteacher, Annie, who is killed by the birds in an attempt to protect the little sister of Rod Taylor's character. Considering this was in the sixties, the visual effects were quite impressive, and the sound effect of the bird noises was haunting.All in all, Hitchcock has crafted one masterful, eerie classic worthy of being preserved for generations to come.",10,1,2,5 February 2016
