The Avengers," Review in 3 parts
","This is a review is in 3 parts: The movie, The message, The future.First the movie is the sum of its parts. They are done well which seems undisputed from movie making, acting, special effects....etc...POV. However it ISN'T MORE than the sum of its parts which we consider the classics to be. It's like addition, but NO multiplication. It is so segmented and connected by convenient superficial ways. As far as box office records, it should make this much money given the awareness of this movie since IRon MAn, 6 individual movies and the increase in ticket prices. If it didn't then it would be an unmitigated disaster.Secondly the Message, it is a war mongering movie. It declares that we have to fight whoever to the death and we will be victorious. Contrast that with the message of the Dark Knight, which tries to say we can overcome this violence some other way and sometimes to do that, there is no clear victory or nor should there be. That ultimately too much war or too much peace is too imbalanced to survive or thrive. So you see the different styles serve their messages where Avengers tries to not go too deep and NOT show much of the ugliness while Dark Knight shows it all.Finally, the future. There is tug of war between people who think we are doomed to fight it out or we can find another way. The END DAYS vs. the beginning of new era. What we believe is what will happen because actions will be driven by them. If the Avengers approaches the Dark KNight or surpasses it. Then we are Doomed :(. To show we aren't doomed, go see it once, but no more to show you are open :).We need a landmark movie to bridge these two sides. I just hope it's not too late.",7,0,5,7 May 2012
