The Blair Witch Project," Simply pure genius
","The Blair Witch Project is easily the scariest movie I've ever seen. Ask someone what they thought of it, theyll either tell you they loved it or hated it. Anyone can play some scary music and have a guy in a mask jump out and hack some poor big chested ditz to pieces, but it takes a movie like blair witch to get the true scary movie effect. A movie where you are actually scared when you leave the theater, not just startled for a few seconds. I did think the Blair Witch was hyped a little to much, that is the quickest way to ruin a movie.",Null,1,1,30 August 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Makes me proud to be a part of the human race again...
","People can pick and tear at this film all they want, it is probably the greatest holocaust movie of all time. It renews faith in the human spirit, and focuses on the positive side of tragedy. It brings out all the emotions Schindler's List did, but with none of the blood, none of the violence, none of the politics. It is truly a movie everyone should watch.",10,1,2,13 November 1999
