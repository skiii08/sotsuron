The Ring," Good Movie!
","I'm a 27 year old male who is a self proclaimed 'movie buff'. I love horror movies, but it seems like in the last 10-15 years there hasnt been that many decent movies come out that have actually creeped me out. I don't get spooked easy, but The Ring creeped me out quite a bit. I say ignore any bad reviews you read and go check this movie out. Naomi Watts was great(as always).",9,0,0,19 October 2002
