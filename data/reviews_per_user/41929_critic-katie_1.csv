National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Book of Secrets
","I thought the movie had a brilliant plot and you definitely don't need to see the first National Treasure movie in order to understand the concepts of this continuation. I hadn't seen the first movie and it was easy to understand what was going on as their were minimum references to the first movie. The actors portrayals of their characters were great, and overall the movie is worth seeing at the cinemas as you wouldn't get the same screen quality renting it out on DVD. It would be interesting to know if some of the facts in the movie can be generalised to real life, such as whether there really is a book that presidents use, whether the city of gold exists, and whether this tale has non-fiction aspects.",9,0,4,30 January 2008
