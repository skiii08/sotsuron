It," Incredibly Different From The Original 1990 IT Film
",I am Die Hard horror fan. I love Halloween 1978' Saw' Texas Chainsaw' Chucky' Jason' freddy' and many more. My review of!!!!! Just saw this movie last night' expecting to Crap My pants since the original did. If your expecting IT 2017 to be very scary' and to blow your pants off ' don't bother seeing it. I was kind of disappointed and was expecting the new IT Film to deliver more of a frightening bloody more detail FILM. This is a whole different FILM nothing like the original from the 1900s. the new IT FILM has nothing to do with the original.. this movie should have had some part with the original. This movie in my books Did not deliver.... The only good things about this FILM. the kids in this movie worked hard. This Film has more blood than the original'. this film shows what kids did in the 1980s ... This film has more violent scenes' I would say this NEW It Movie will beat the original in Blood' violence' swearing' just overall more going with the flow....The bad things. The movie was rushed' the movie does not follow the original' the Film kind of does not make sense and this Film is not very detailed like the original... The original was planned out ' it had major twist' it just had more details' the original had you on your seats wanting more' this new film does not... The new it FILm was OK and yes I will watch it again but is it worth waiting for nooooo. The 1990 Clown was more real ' the new Clown is more scary but is more Fakeish not very impressed with the director going with this new clown look. It very well could of been way better and could of delivered a much better much more detailed Film Like the original did.... The original will go down in history as being the best of killer clowns... Hopefully IT 2017 for part 2 will be better. Maybe it will change my mind and give me something that's like the original... You never know.,5,26,51,8 September 2017
Jurassic World," Spoiler alert kind off.. Movie is OK. But definitely not better than first 3 films.
","Spoiler This is a truthful review. Even in 3D movie was OK. Would I watch again noooo. First off, Sam Neil not in movie makes it iffy. second no other actors except BD Wong was in this FILm. So again movie iffy.. third 3D is good but again movie can't preform like other 3 films. The new dinosaur was OK but could of Been more scary and vicious. More people should of died, movie looked to be more into dinosaur and human team work which I liked but could of been more of a better script. What really got my attention was when the old TREX showed up, and went one on one with new dinosaur. I think they should of included dinosaur from third film when he killed Trex. And last I hope they make another Jurassic park FIlm and not Jurassic world. Because this one was definitely a waste of my time and I expected lot more like from first film. Please bring back Sam Neil and rest of gang. And another 3d Fiml...",4,3,14,11 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star wars At it's Worst... Overall trash...
",So very very disappointed with this new starwar film.. can't believe how dumbit is.. Spoiler ahead. This movie has Lots of action with new stars. But Han Solo dies so movie is not going to be good in next Star Wars movie. So very very disappointed. Luke Skywalker Was only in 2 percent of film so that is a major major disappointment. Laia was only in this film 10 percent of time. Another major disappointment . This movie is not worth the money' it's not worth buying it on DVD' such a major disappointment and crap.... I really think they ruined the Star Wars saga.... And I lost hope.. Hopefully next time they could have a better more reliable director Instead of a movie that is pure trash' actually Trash is better than this film.... Unless you wanna see just new characters and same old action stuff with no new story no new nothing go for it.. so I give this film 2 stars ........ I really should get refund for this garbage and so should The rest of the world ... I can't remember seeing a movie like this that made me almost puke ' I have no words to describe this movie except Garbadge ' trash' waste of money and time... I'm gonna leave it at that....,2,23,32,26 December 2015
Casino," Performance. the actors were great_Felt Too Real
",Not going to go into a lot of details with this movie because it is a great movie. I don't want to spoil anything.. almost as good as Goodfellas.The actors were great . Almost like God created them for these movies. The performance of q Joe pesci was great. They don't make these kind of movies anymore. these movies that they made in the 80s and 90s nothing will compare to what these movies were' LED on by great directorsthe only part that really brought me to tears that made my stomach turn .wanted to throw up was the ending scene where Nicky and his brother got beat the hell up. then got buried alive. that's the only part that really made my stomach turn... Other than that it was a great movieI've never seen the movie before but now that I've seen it .I'll recommend it to anybody that likes those type of movies... Can't say anything else. Just watch it alongside Goodfellas.... You won't be disappointed... and if you are disappointed with these films or these type of movies .. then this is not for your generation....,7,0,0,24 April 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson Film at his best.... A True explosive/emotional FILM..
","I was not into watching war films but one of my family members said I needed to watch this film because it was based on true events and had a lot of blow up action .... I decided to watch this and let me just say MY GOD, Your in for a treat .. if you want a movie full of action Blood, weapons , Tears, Love, courage, Heart, and Sadness this movie is for you.... I watched the whole movie from start to end, I had tears coming out of my eyes. It truly shows what are soldiers go through... the devastation is insane, the blood is insane.. I mean it's such a good film and has a very good director, this movie deserves high rattings... this movie keeps you wanting more and more and keeps you on your seat . The only thing I wished for is that Mel Gibson would of added more action to this movie... but overall it's a very good movie and hope Mel Gibson makes another one.........",7,1,2,10 September 2017
