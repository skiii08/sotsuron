The Blair Witch Project," Run, don't walk AWAY from this movie.
",People who gave this film a 10 must either be a masochist or easily enthralled by shiny objects.  Blair Witch is a complete waste of time and money.  It has my vote for the most irritating movie of all time.  After sitting through the 80 minutes of the film (was it ONLY 80 minutes?  It felt like an eternity) I felt like the film makers had lured me into the theater to kick me in the ass and steal my nine bucks.  Save some cash- just pay the bum on the corner a quarter to scream obscenities at you for an hour and you'll glean about the same measure of enjoyment.,1,3,6,29 September 1999
