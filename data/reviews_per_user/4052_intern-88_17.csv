The King's Speech," The King's Speech: it doesn't speak for me
","Apart from causing some debate over historical accuracy, The King's Speech has been almost unanimously praised. Its stars, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, received BAFTAs for their performances and the film has been nominated for 12 Academy Awards. So, seeking to escape the heatwave here in Australia a couple of weeks back, I finally went to see what all the fuss was about.With one exception – its self-conscious swearing – this is a film so traditional in both aesthetic form and apparent values that it could have been made at the time of the events portrayed. Except that if it were from the 1930s (unless merely a rank propaganda exercise), The King's Speech might have offered a complex insight into real history. It might have marshalled the strict rules of classical Hollywood narrative filmmaking that were then at peak development to deliver, not only taut and fast-moving cinema, but perhaps also a thematically interesting and not entirely predictable work. Instead, as it is, the film moves with leaden-footed obviousness to an inevitable conclusion, the narrative offering no surprises within and between scenes, and tells its story through consistently bland images.Tom Hooper, the TV-based director of The King's Speech, has clearly tried to make a 'quality film' here by ticking all the boxes designed to please a sizable adult audience that understandably dislikes contemporary Hollywood movies aimed at teenage boys. The film is peppered with some English-weather-derived atmospheric exterior shots familiar from countless BBC period dramas. The interior scenes are dominated by shots that strive for classical lightness and transparency but are, in fact, rather arbitrary-looking and quite artless.This clumsy TV version of a would-be 'quality Hollywood'-style movie becomes momentarily unhinged when what some pernickety film scholars call the '180-degree line' is broken during a conversation scene, so that a cut to a new shot seems to show one character suddenly looking in the opposite direction despite not having moved. If it popped up much earlier in the film, this moment might have promised something more than a poor, wheezy version of outmoded film language. But it was merely a mistake.For its many admirers, the film's character-based drama makes The King's Speech clearly superior to blow-'em-up Hollywood cinema, especially as given life by two 'virtuoso' performances. But beyond surface theatrics, what kind of world do these vividly portrayed figures perform for us?As the Prince Albert, Duke of York, or 'Bertie' to his family, Colin Firth's familiar on-screen persona reaches an almost ridiculous apotheosis of privileged, repressed English masculinity. Here he gives us its absolute zenith as the humiliated, chronically stammering unelected hereditary heir and then leader - as King George VI - of the world's most powerful country, a huge number of whose domestic and colonial subjects (25 per cent of the Earth's population, as a radio announcer proudly reminds us in an early scene) suffer lives of shameful poverty and exploitation. This, remember, is Britain before Labour's extensive postwar welfare and social reforms (following the June 1945 landslide election defeat of Winston Churchill's Conservative Party). This is the country whose nineteenth-century slums and working conditions were the prime source material for Marx and Engels' famous works.But potential subversion is gradually enough drowned in the sentimental goo of an unequal love story, with feisty egalitarianism kept safely in check as therapeutic method. So the offence Lionel causes prior to George VI's coronation by lounging on his throne, saying 'I don't care how many Royal arseholes have sat here', is engineered to try and generate some proprietorial hubris befitting a hereditary ruler – not exactly the act of a colonial ratbag.Lionel, the King's 'friend' by the end, finally utters the distinctly impersonal 'Your Majesty' with satisfied you've-earned-it approval following his coaching of the new monarch to inevitable triumph: not only delivering a stammer-free, gravitas-laden radio speech to the nation and its colonies, but also giving the royal imprimatur to Britain's declaration of war on Germany. In this seemingly odd-couple romance, the character who at first seems to be a more modern figure who is disrespectful of stuffy tradition and quintessential hierarchy ends up reaffirming such values by instilling faith in the crown's 'natural' wearer.While US and UK critics and audiences have their own problematic reasons for extolling the film, Australians have exhibited pride that it has a prominent local presence both on and off screen. But even more perhaps that it is our man – resplendent with his moderate middle-class Australian accent (via notably theatrical diction) – who stands up, initially at least, to the quintessence of undemocratic English power and privilege that we think we love to knock.However, far from being discredited or disavowed, through being 'made human' the symbolic ruler of such a world is updated for the then-new mass media age and for our own current self-help era. Showing us that 'royals have problems, too', the Australian in The King's Speech effectively cures – indeed redeems – the sclerotic privileges and personage of colonial-era British monarchy.With the literal and figurative restoring of the King's speech, egalitarian and potentially more radical words and visions are silenced. The film thereby also reinforces the clichés of stuffy old England and brash young Australia – as affectionate, mutually reliant partners joined in an embrace that effectively rejuvenates the former's traditional pomp and power thanks to the latter's fresh coat of reassuring paint.The King's Speech, then, is the ultimate, conservative, middlebrow, made-to-order Oscar contender.",7,2,3,21 June 2012
Moneyball," Football can't be reduced to number-crunching
","What on earth is Aaron Sorkin playing at? First he succeeded in glamorising IT nerds in his screenplay for The Social Network. Now he's at it again, glorifying nerds in another movie, Moneyball, which tells the story of how statistical analysis revolutionised baseball. The moneyball concept – using performance metrics to gain a competitive sporting advantage – is relatively well known on this side of the pond. The million-dollar question is whether Moneyball could be successfully transplanted to football.The film, which opened in the UK last week, is based on Michael Lewis' bestselling book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The hero of the story is Oakland Athletics baseball coach Billy Beane, who successfully used 'outsider' performance data or sabermetrics – a term derived from the acronym Society for American Baseball Research – to recruit players who were overlooked by old-fashioned 'insider' scouting knowledge. It wasn't that baseball had completely eschewed statistics. Rather, the new metrics deployed by Beane, such as on-base percentage, proved more effective than traditional indicators, like batting averages. Beane's use of performance data to unearth gems from college baseball paid considerable dividends. In 2002, the Oakland Athletics were able to compete with powerful rivals, such as the New York Yankees, whose salary budgets were three times as high. The moneyball approach was game changing. Today, most of the big baseball teams employ full- time sabermetric analysts.In the film, Brad Pitt performs the part of Billy Beane. It's a cynical piece of casting, a blow for nerd supremacy. Will it wow British audiences? Judging by my wife's point-blank refusal even to consider a trip to the cinema, this might not be a film for the ladies. For her, even top-drawer Hollywood eye-candy isn't sufficient to sweeten the unpalatable mix of sport plus statistics. Maybe I should have pretended that the film was based on a long-lost Akira Kurosawa screenplay about a group of unheralded samurai warriors recruited by a number-crunching monk. Anyhow, I digress. Although the missus wasn't interested, Moneyball will appeal to the swelling ranks of statistic-obsessed football fans. The successes of Fantasy Football Leagues and the computer game Championship Manager attest to the popularity among geeky men – and it is predominantly a bloke thing - of performance data as a tool for predicting footballing success.But, while Opta stats might enable laptop managers to achieve virtual success on Championship Manager, could data analysis be a recipe for winning real silverware? Billy Beane believes that football's version of sabermetrics is out there waiting to be discovered. 'Every business has metrics that correlate to success', Beane recently told the BBC. 'It's just finding them and which ones are the most valuable and which ones do you invest in and which ones you get a return on.' It's certainly true that some performance data is now considered indispensible in professional football. Most top clubs now use Prozone analytical tools to evaluate player performance and design individually tailored training regimes. Damien Comolli, Liverpool's director of football, is both a friend of Beane and a fan of his methods – though, as Gabriele Marcotti recently observed in The Times (London), 'it's hard to see how Liverpool's summer signings fall into the moneyball category'. Marcotti has a point. Is splashing £35million on Andy Carroll evidence of smart stats or just an old-fashioned hunch?Arsene Wenger is another well-known stats obsessive. 'Technical superiority can be measured', Wenger has said. 'In the past, it was just about feelings, opinions. I wanted to know a little bit more. I am always in the situation where I have to judge people, and the more concrete, objective numbers you have the better you can achieve that.' Wenger places a great premium on passing speed and, consequently, he measures the average time players spend on the ball. Less time on the ball indicates better technique.Prozone or Opta can be useful for measuring some aspects of performance, such as fitness or passing accuracy. But, unlike baseball or cricket, which are comprised of a series of individual episodes of play, football is a relatively fluid and complex game which makes metrics for individual player performance much more difficult to devise. How do you measure movement off the ball, positional awareness, defensive concentration, good decision-making or tactical nous? Fabio Capello recently said that he could tell from the England warm-up that his players weren't in the right frame of mind. Can Prozone tell you that? It's easy to ridicule conventional scouting wisdom but, while there are metrics for fitness or passing accuracy, the old methods are still better for assessing whether a player has the hunger or drive to succeed, whether he has a good football brain, whether he is a leader on the pitch or whether he is mentally tough. There are too many subjective success factors such as these which are nigh on impossible to quantify.I'm all for using analytical tools to aid coaching. However, I find it reassuring that no one has yet discovered a moneyball-style winning formula. Success in football is determined by attributes such as character or creativity and this can't be measured so easily. Football is still more art than science. The title will never be won by algorithms. The nerds will never take over.",Null,0,0,12 June 2012
127 Hours," A kind of Eat, Pray, Love for men
","'We were going to make an action movie in which the hero can't move', said director Danny Boyle of his latest movie 127 Hours, treating its completion as something of a challenge. Boyle needn't have worried; heading a team drawn from his earlier productions, he delivers a punchy, convincing and watchable piece of work. (Rodrigo Cortés got there last year with Buried, a taphephobic thriller trapping Ryan Reynolds in an underground box. And film purists will say Hitchcock did it with Rear Window.) Fortunately, cinematography and sound design help to create enough variety around likable protagonist James Franco for the movie not to seem like being trapped in a canyon for 127 hours.Adapted from Between a Rock and a Hard Place – a memoir by Aron Ralston – the film concerns the five-day period when, following a freak accident, a young climber's right hand was pinned by a falling boulder. Since no one knew of Ralston's whereabouts, starvation and dehydration loomed even though the pain of the injury had subsided. In print, Ralston's involuntarily immobility is an opportunity to reflect on his past life and mistakes; the movie uses condensed flashbacks, which mean Ralston's personal reflections seldom displace the more practical issue of survival. Despite these differences, book and film alike act as unwitting barometers of certain changes in society's values.The opening images reveal huge crowds on the move, combining what could be footage left over from Slumdog Millionaire with a basketball game at Utah Jazz's EnergySolutions Arena. Quite deliberately, this creates a contrast between the heaving multitudes of modern life and the solitary virtues of the wilderness. By showing rather than telling, Boyle lets us work this out by ourselves – which comes as a relief, compared to equivalent passages in Ralston's autobiography. In both film and book, the central narrative – trapped man has to go to extremes to escape – grabs the imagination.Ralston's memoir shows him embracing the outdoor life and abandoning a conventional career. Trained as an engineer, he focuses on the weekend – athletically hiking and attacking canyons and mountains with vigour – until the weekend's activities take priority completely. Eventually Ralston downsizes to working in a climbing gear shop and as a rescue volunteer because that is what he wants to do: 'because it's there' is the rationale for his outdoor activities. 'Climbing fourteeners in the winter by myself wasn't just something I did; it became who I was', he writes.Ralston writes of human estrangement from nature, all the while revealing his estrangement from other humans. For Boyle, there's no need to spell this out as ploddingly as the book does; instead it is implied, by cutting back and forth between beautiful landscapes and Ralston's claustrophobic surroundings, or between a crowded screen and the isolated figure cut by Franco throughout his restrained performance. The protagonist's estrangement from friends and relatives ends up played out into a half-hallucinated domestic world in which the dying Ralston makes (and videotapes) his apologies. Boyle has been accused of misanthropy before, as in his pseudo-zombie fest 28 Days Later, but here the disdain for humans seems to be more Ralston's message, whose ordeal could be seen as a realistic personal apocalypse.It is no spoiler to say that Ralston escaped by cutting off his right forearm. Indeed, among various commentators the shorthand – no pun intended – is to call this 'the amputation scene'. 'If you don't mind, I'm going before the arm', one squeamish critic told the receptionist at the press screening I attended. Those who stuck around witnessed a realistic looking scene where mobility is regained by hacking through flesh with a blunt multi-tool – one of those steel knocks-off of the Leatherman multiknife, handed out as freebies at petrol stations. Not only are they useless for chipping away at boulders, but, as audiences will see, they are also completely unsuitable as surgical instruments. Given the annual popularity of the Saw franchise, it is not impossible that this gruesome 'money shot' will be one of the things bringing people into the multiplexes and scooping up the pirate DVD in pubs, especially since improvements in prosthetics and digital effects are such that surgical scenes have acquired greater verisimilitude in the past decade.More seriously, the film has the universal appeal of making one ask 'what would I do in that situation? How far would I be prepared to go?' For this generation, more distant from the horrors of warfare and taught that the body is a temple, the loss of a hand is about the worst thing that could happen, unless bigger body parts were to be amputated and left under a rock. All this should perhaps prompt some reflection on how body horror got so mainstream.127 Hours ends – more or less – in a rescue, showing starkly some of the benefits of modern life. A black helicopter gets Ralston out of the wilderness and into hospital, not a snow-white ptarmigan. Accidents aside, Ralston's commitment to nature (and its capture on film by Boyle and team) is possible precisely because of us living in a developed society, with other people chipping in their skills towards his care and rehabilitation and, more recently, to back up his continuing career as a mountaineer.If filmed ordeals, body horror and wilderness worship all combine to make this inspiring tale of survival into a message of the moment, so too does the rise and rise of Ralston himself. 'My accident and rescue from Blue John Canyon were the most beautifully spiritual experiences of my life', his book concludes – a kind of Eat, Pray, Love for men. That Ralston stepped out of hospital and on to a treadmill of talkshows and the high-priced motivational speaking circuit makes him quite a typical accidental celebrity for our times.",10,1,3,21 June 2012
Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen and the perils of nostalgia
","In the seventeenth century, Swiss doctors identified a new disease: nostalgia, a pathological homesickness that turned those afflicted with it indifferent to their surroundings and aching for the past. Nostalgics were treated with opium, leeches and warm emulsions, but for the demoralised Swiss mercenaries serving in foreign armies the best hope for cure was a swift discharge and a walk in the Alps.Nostalgia has lost none of its paralysing powers, but the idea that it should be purged now seems bizarre, even immoral. Our fast-paced modern lifestyle is regarded as rife with danger, stress and vacuity. It's nothing, in other words, like the good old days, which always seem so great precisely because you can project on to them whatever fantasies you have of how wonderful life would be, if only But there's no use, of course, in being nostalgic for the days when yearning for the past was seen as a fatal weakness rather than a virtue.In any case, it's perfectly common to wish that you had a shot of experiencing life in a different era. In Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen's Oscar-nominated film, an aspiring novelist is granted this wish as he is transported to Paris in the Twenties, a time when American writers settled in droves on the bohemian Left Bank and attended the soirees of Gertrude Stein, who dubbed them 'the Lost Generation'.Gil's (Owen Wilson) nocturnal time travels take him away from his well-to-do fiancée and in-laws who, after just a few days in Paris, are homesick for California. When Gil suggests long walks in the rain, his wife-to-be Inez (Rachel McAdams) insists on lunch in upmarket restaurants. When Gil fantasises about living in a Parisian attic with a skylight, Inez reminds him they have settled on a Malibu beach house.Apart from an iconic city, a self-deprecating writer, a mismatched couple and cerebral banter, Midnight in Paris has another Allen hallmark: an unbearable pseudo-intellectual. The know-it-all pedant Paul (Michael Sheen) is in town with his girlfriend Carol (Nina Arianda). He's been invited to lecture at the Sorbonne but, an apparent connoisseur of everything from Monet to the Ancien Régime, Paul has seemingly endless time to guide an impressed Inez and a dejected Gil around the city. At the Musée Rodin, he even insists that the guide (played by a pouty Carla Bruni) doesn't know her art history. And at the Palace of Versailles, he deconstructs the premise of Gil's novel, which centres on the owner of a nostalgia shop.'Nostalgia', says the smug Paul, 'is denial; denial of the painful present And the name for this fallacy is called golden-age thinking - the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one's living in. It's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those people who find it difficult to cope with the present.' Understandably, Gil finds it difficult to cope with Paul and one night, after making his excuses, he gets lost on his way back to the hotel. At the stroke of midnight, an antique car swerves by and he is swept off to a night of Twenties-style revelry in the company of Cole Porter, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. The magic teleportation repeats itself night after night. Gil gets his book critiqued by Gertrude Stein, has a surreal conversation with Salvador Dali and gives Luis Buñuel an idea for a movie about bourgeois guests trapped at a dinner party (Buñuel doesn't understand why they wouldn't just get up and leave).The artists and writers whom Gil meets are figments of his - and our - imagination. Allen makes them conform to stereotypes: Picasso is a brusque womaniser, Hemingway is a macho bottle-swinger, Gertrude Stein is a mother hen for artistic geniuses. No wonder Gil wistfully says they are exactly like he pictured them.It's Gil's romance with serial artists' mistress Adriana (Marillon Cotillard) that eventually brings him back to reality and makes him accept that he really belongs in 2010. Adriana dreams of La Belle Époque, a time when Parisians rode around in horse carts and Tolouse-Lautrec, Gaugin and Degas hung out at Maxim's. But they, it turns out, feel their generation 'lacks imagination' and wish they'd lived during the Renaissance so they could have painted along the likes of Michelangelo.Perhaps the obnoxious Paul had a point after all Golden-age thinking can certainly be stifling. Woody Allen, if anyone, should know, as his films always seem to be measured against his past greats. But Midnight in Paris doesn't disappoint. The film is whimsical, intelligent, romantic and, yes, wonderfully nostalgic. After all, at a time when those insisting we should forgo modern life in favour of a simpler past seem to be dominating, Allen lets us escape to a world where those pessimistic bores weren't quite so numerous.",8,0,0,6 June 2012
Warrior," Warrior: a daft movie with a kick in the tale
","Over the past two decades, mixed martial arts (MMA) has become increasingly popular in America. The Brazilian Vale Tudo (anything goes) style was brought to the US in 1993 with the establishment of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). At first the tournament was designed to find the most effective martial art, but as the UFC developed competitors began to incorporate different styles in order to get the edge on their opponents. As a result, MMA, as it is known today, was born.While it began as a brutal cable-TV novelty, efforts to refine the rules, such as introducing weight classes and safety regulations, led to MMA finding acceptance in the mainstream arena. In recent years, pay- per-view sales of UFC bouts have even begun to challenge those of both boxing and professional wrestling.Of course, the next natural step in the sport's legitimisation was for Hollywood to immortalise MMA in a star-studded sports drama. Lo and behold, we now have Gavin O'Connor's Warrior, a clumsy and faintly ridiculous film which somehow still manages to tug at the old heart strings.Warrior begins in the grey streets of Pittsburgh. Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy), an Iraq War veteran and all-round badass, pays his father Paddy (Nick Nolte) a visit. Tommy and his mother had fled their home when Tommy was a teenager, due to Paddy's alcohol-fuelled violence, and Tommy's mum died soon after. Returning to the family home, Tommy taunts his father about his past, but then, for no apparent reason, decides to stick around. Coincidentally, a new MMA tournament called Sparta, which promises $5million to its champion, has just been announced. Tommy decides to enter, and despite his supposed hatred of the man, enlists the help of his father, who used to train him in his pee-wee wrestling days.We are then introduced to Brendan (Joel Edgerton), Tommy's older brother who decided to stay with his father when Tommy and his mother left. A former UFC fighter, Brendan is now working as a high-school physics teacher and living in the Philadelphia suburbs with his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two children. On the verge of bankruptcy, he enters Sparta in order to pay back his mortgage and prevent the bank from foreclosing on his home.Not only is this a pretty flimsy preamble to the inevitable showdown/reconciliation between Tommy and Brendan, but these dual story lines are also painfully ill-conceived. Tommy's justification – that taking his father on as his trainer is strictly business – seems somewhat insubstantial considering his torturous childhood. Also, the fact that Brendan is clearly past his prime is glazed over by the claim that anything can happen in MMA. Nevertheless, the film casually skips over each of these gaping plot holes in order to get Tommy and Brendan in that ring together.At times, the plot seems almost insignificant as the film's constant promotion of MMA seems to suggest it is primarily designed to celebrate and legitimise the sport. Before entering Sparta, Brendan is suspended from his teaching job as it is discovered he is taking part in smalltown MMA tournaments. The principal tells him that, as a teacher, he 'doesn't belong in the ring with those animals', to which Brendan responds: 'I used to be one of those animals.' Moments like this seem to suggest that O'Connor is less concerned with making a believable drama than he is with challenging the sport's image as a brutal hobby.As the tournament begins and the fight scenes take centre stage, O'Connor provides some much needed relief from the shoddy backstory. However, while these intense sequences do indeed showcase the athleticism that the sport requires, it soon descends into shameless MMA propaganda which becomes tiresome rather quickly.But just as soon as you think that Tommy and Brendan are mere 2D vehicles to promote the sport, something strange happens: you find yourself caring about them. While Warrior takes some very cheap shots, using everything from alcoholism to the Iraq War to try to force an emotional response, in the end it is also a humane, soppy story.In much the same way that in Rocky, Sylvester Stallone produced a much better performance by getting his head bashed in than he ever could have under his own steam, the strained relationship between Brendan and Tommy only becomes truly heart-breaking when they're trying to knock each other out. While this by no means makes up for the plot's many faults, the occasional emotional intensity somewhat compensates for all the boorishness.Warrior is truly little more than an advert for MMA wrapped up in a lumbering and predictable storyline. But if you can be bothered to stay to the end, it still packs a punch.",6,0,4,13 June 2012
The White Ribbon," Haneke: films for middle-class masochists
","Austrian film director Michael Haneke's latest, The White Ribbon: A German Children's Story, has already won the Palme d'Or. The chances are it'll pick up Best Foreign Film at next month's Oscars, too. Critics have heaped praise upon it, and art-house audiences have flocked to see it. You see, there's just something about Haneke's work that culture vultures can't stick their beaks into quick enough.Which, in its way, is puzzling. Not because Haneke is not a talented filmmaker. Far from it, in fact. From their stately structures to the languorous, deliberately disconcerting extended takes, his films are always painstakingly crafted. No detail is accidental, no thing unthought. No, what's puzzling about Haneke's popularity amongst those who take their films nearly as seriously as they take themselves is that his films are so desolating. Almost every review of Haneke's work gushes with the same adjectives: disturbing, disquieting, discomfiting. Haneke's films don't please, they unsettle. They are the artistic equivalent of middle-class masochism.Funny Games, for instance, was the heartwarming tale of a nice bourgeois family tortured to death by a couple of boys in tennis kit. The Piano Teacher was the groin-girding story of a nice bourgeois society driving a libidinous pianist to torture her genitals. Hidden was an endearing portrait of a nice bourgeois couple tortured to distraction by post- colonial guilt, and unfathomable surveillance. But it's not just the content that is so dismal. Formally, too, his films resist pleasure. Almost without fail they refuse to resolve themselves into anything resembling a conclusion. This is hardly surprising: agency in his work, whether that of psychotic kids or camcorder-wielding stalkers, is without reason. Bad things happen, that's all we on Earth can know.The White Ribbon: A German Children's Story is no exception to Haneke's rule of thumb – build something dispiriting and the plaudits will come. Set in a German village on the eve of the First World War, it centres around several inexplicable acts of cruelty and misadventure that perplex the small community. The local doctor is sent tumbling from his horse by a trip wire; a female labourer has a fatal accident at the saw mill; the son of the village baron is found hanging upside down in a barn, his backside bleeding following a severe beating. Misfortune and malice continue to afflict the locals. And they, along with us, have no real idea, but plenty of suspicions, as to who is causing this.The chief suspects are ostensibly the village children, a ghostly bunch that congregate near the houses of victims. Whether this is out of concern or cruelty we are never sure. But Haneke has a deeper motive than creating some Turn of the Screw-style ambiguity around pallid kids, or even a whodunit, with no who and little dunit. His concern, rather, seems to be with a society that breeds cruelty.Consequently, the village here functions as Haneke's view of society as a whole. It's a study in psychopathology, a portrait of a community in which cruelty is mundane and evil banal. Haneke seems to want us to see this village as an incubator for some coming monstrosity. Little wonder that every relationship is packed full of latent violence, each interactions pregnant with menace. And given the film's pre-First World War German setting, we can be in little doubt that Haneke intends us to see where and when the seeds of fascism were sown.The problem with all this is that it is so thoroughly hackneyed. The principle unit of socialisation here – the family – is portrayed as little more than a Freudian caricature, which, given that Haneke studied psychology in Vienna, is perhaps apt. Still, that doesn't make it any more edifying an insight. From the doctor 'fingering' his 14-year-old daughter to the pastor tying his son's arms to the bed to stop him from masturbating, abuse and repression is the familial norm here. And so it must be if Haneke is to reduce the brutal extremes of Nazism to a psychological sickness generated in the bosom of the family.Perverting the great psychoanalyst himself, one child, Erna, asks her teacher 'if you dream of something, really dream of something, can it come true?'. Her dream? The torture and near blinding of the local disabled kid. The suggestion is clear. The routine repression, often cruel, always damaging, is creating psychotic dreamwork, and dreams here, as the eventual torture and near blinding of the local disabled kid show, do become real.To Haneke, this is just how it is – 'the truth is obscene', he said in a recent interview. All he's doing is making us see. And what a vision it is. In Haneke's films, human society is sunken, rank, a place where mass culture is dumb, where people, turned on and tuned off by TV, are cruel and complacent, and where families will, for time immemorial, f*** you up. Socialisation here is virtually synonymous with corruption.Why is this vision so popular? What is it about this crass, aloof moralising that is so attractive? The answer lies in the question. In Haneke, every countercultural prejudice, from the perils of consumerism and mainstream entertainment to the denunciation of the family, is given a sophisticated artistic form. Never has liberal snobbery looked so clever.",8,2,5,22 June 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The girl who was hard to take seriously
","Stieg Larsson's 'Millennium' series of books has become one of the most successful literary franchises in recent memory. In 2005, the first novel in the series, Män som hatar kvinnor (meaning 'men who hate women'), was published in Sweden and quickly generated a considerable amount of critical attention. Its English translation in 2008, renamed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, pushed it to even greater heights and it became an international bestseller, alongside the subsequent two installments.Attacking sadism and moral corruption in all its modern forms, Larsson's crime thrillers captured the public imagination the world over. Much of the trilogy's success, however, is owed to the legend created by Larsson's untimely death in 2004. The first book in the series was published a year after his death and marketed as a classic sent from beyond the grave. Furthermore, as critics and fans began to delve into the past of this mysterious dead author, his career as a feather-ruffling investigative journalist gave the series a heightened sense of authenticity and depth.Having already produced an award-winning Swedish film outing, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has now received the full Hollywood treatment. With David Fincher, director of films including The Social Network and Fight Club, at the helm, this no-expense-spared remake seemed poised to do full justice to the novel while giving the uninitiated a chance to experience Larsson's world without needing to pick up the hefty novel or bother with pesky subtitles. Whereas Fincher does well not to cleanse the narrative of its difficult moments, however, there is something painfully amiss at the centre of this adaptation.Other than a few minor changes and the relocation of some of the action to London, Steven Zaillian's screenplay sticks pretty closely to the original story. Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a disgraced investigative journalist, who loses a libel case against corrupt businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg), after publishing an exposé on his dodgy dealings. Soon after, Blomkvist is asked by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a retired businessman himself, to investigate the disappearance of his niece Harriet, who he believes was murdered by one of his malevolent family over 40 years ago. With the promise that Vanger will provide him with the dirt he needs on Wennerström to overturn the libel case, Mikael accepts and enlists the help of punky private investigator Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).As a straight-up society murder-mystery, this film works rather well. Set in the desolate northern reaches of Sweden on Vanger's private island, Mikael and Lisbeth discover a web of dark family secrets, complete with old Nazi uncles and torture chambers hidden under hilltop mansions. Fincher's glossy style lends well to this material, and he provides us with a conventional but pleasurable whodunit.As with so many detective narratives, however, the psyche of the investigator is as important as the mystery itself. In Larsson's novel, it is Salander rather than solely Blomkvist's character that is subject to this exploration. This is something critically lacking in Fincher's adaptation. Having grown up under state supervision, Lisbeth suffers constantly at the hands of abusive and vindictive social workers. It is her hatred of the sort of sadistic men who take advantage of her that fuels her efforts in solving the case of the murdered Harriet. Unfortunately, Fincher buries the pathos of her character in his characteristically slick aesthetic. As a result, she becomes little more than a cartoonish badass with a difficult past, who swaggers around spouting one-liners and smoking endless amounts of cigarettes. Whereas Mara is at times remarkably intense in the role, it becomes incredibly difficult to take her seriously as the film wears on.Despite the often-sanitising effects of Hollywood financiers, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo really doesn't pull any of its punches. The central, graphic scenes that defined the murky tone of the novel are all here, yet unfortunately the crisp styling renders them emotionally inert nonetheless. The few who will go to see this film without any preconceptions may well find it an enjoyable, if somewhat dark, mystery thriller.

Drive," A true triumph of style over substance
","Among the films that triumphed at Cannes this year, Drive seems pretty out of place. While the Palme d'Or and Best Actress awards went to Tree of Life and Melancholia, two films that respectively tackle the beginning and end of all life, Drive, a film about a stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver, won Nicolas Winding Refn the prize for Best Director. But while it may sound like a wobbly premise for another The Fast and the Furious movie, Drive is an intense, affecting and prizeworthy thrill ride.The plot combines all the aspects of violence, romance and revenge one would expect. While living alone and working as a stuntman, mechanic and getaway driver for hire, the unnamed protagonist (Ryan Gosling) becomes enamoured with mum-next-door Irene (Carey Mulligan). But just as they're hitting it off, her jailbird husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released. The driver takes a respectful step back, yet gets pulled into helping Standard do one last job to pay back his protection-money debts from prison. Needless to say it doesn't go to plan, launching the driver into a brutal fight to save himself and the family he has come to adore. Clearly, the premise isn't all that original, but it is saved by the intelligence and style with which it is executed.Adapted from James Sallis' 2005 novel of the same name, Drive has been in the works for a few years. Originally an action-mystery vehicle for Hugh Jackman, Ryan Gosling was brought in as the new leading man in 2010 and asked Refn to direct. With both Gosling and Refn unaccustomed to the action genre, there is a noticeable reluctance to make just another throwaway explosion-filled flick, as Drive deftly embraces and deflects action-movie convention.The film opens with sweeping aerial shots of the Los Angeles skyline, yet this moody image is accompanied by synth-drenched pop and pink Risky Business-style titles. This juxtaposition of the stern and the kitsch runs throughout the film. A case in point is the protagonist's signature jacket: a quilted, cream, satin number with a large scorpion on the back, which stands in flamboyant contrast to his otherwise blank and inexpressive manner. Gosling's character is also one of the few action- movie heroes who you're likely to see wearing rather sensible driving gloves.After a relatively tame opening, the second half of the film becomes outlandishly gory, yet this constant mediation between the serious and the surreal prevents the film from descending into self-indulgence. For instance, one scene in which the driver attacks the owner of a strip- club with a hammer is offset by the bizarre presence of 20 naked strippers all staring vacantly at the horrific sight.However, this constant play with convention never threatens to compromise the film's intensity. The driving sequences are understated yet very thrilling. Similarly, despite the sparse amount of dialogue, the romance which brews between the driver and Irene is particularly affecting. While Drive incorporates some of the action genre's most tired clichés, Refn excels at taking these standard components and putting them into an odd and more interesting space. The constant fluctuation in tone is at times perplexing, yet the film is all the more engaging for it.In recent years, action filmmakers have either opted for high concepts, epitomised by Christopher Nolan's Inception, or attempted to give us more bang for our buck with action-star ensemble pieces, such as Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables. Drive does neither. With an inventive eye, Nicolas Winding Refn proceeds to make a conventional plot line unrecognisable and, more importantly, enjoyable.Like all great action films, Drive is a triumph of style over substance.",8,0,4,13 June 2012
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas is just the latest example of the Final Solution being reduced to a trite morality tale.
","For one, it is a childhood tale produced and distributed by the Disney subsidiary, Miramax. And like the Dreamfactory's animated features, The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas, which is based on a children's book, is a morality tale and a film which both kids and adults can enjoy.The film tells the story of two eight-year-old boys who are at either side of Auschwitz's fence. The one wearing the 'striped pyjamas' - Shmuel - is a Jew destined for the gas chambers. The other boy, Bruno, is the son of the camp's newly-appointed commandant. The two boys strike up an unlikely friendship.Even after weeks of hanging out with Shmuel by the electric barbed wire fence, playing checkers and eating sandwiches and cakes  which Shmuel wolfs down  Bruno still doesn't realise that the pyjamas are, in fact, uniforms for death camp inmates. He still believes Shmuel lives on some kind of farm for Jews with low ambitions. For example, he observes that one of the 'farmers', Pavel, who often comes over to do grunt work at Bruno's house which is near the camp, 'used to be a doctor, but now he just peels potatoes'.Bruno doesn't get what that smelly smoke coming out of the chimneys is all about or why his dad's subordinate beat Pavel to death just because he spilled some red wine while serving dinner. He never questions why soldiers with barking Alsatians shout orders at the emaciated 'farmers' as they build a wooden hut. And, strangely, Shmuel is rather chubby and manages to get a lot of 'alone-time' by the fence which, in reality, would have been closely monitored by SS soldiers in watchtowers.The question of whether or not the story line and the film's details are plausible might seem petty. After all, the full title of the book it is based on is The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas: A Fable, and so the moral message takes precedence over realism.In depicting the Holocaust through the eyes of innocent children, who are seen as untainted by the evil that apparently lurks in all grown men, John Boyne, the author of the book, and Mark Herman, the film's director, can avoid addressing the historical as well as moral complexity of the Holocaust. They simply urge us to feel the pain of innocent children growing up during the Second World War. The injustice suffered by millions of Jews and others appears inexplicable.The film is simply the latest manifestation of how the Holocaust has been turned into a simplistic fable. It has become a moral absolute for our relativistic times - the one tragedy that we can all agree must never happen again. To this effect, the Holocaust is now evoked in debates on everything from the conflict in Darfur to animal rights and schoolyard bullying.As the film's producer, David Heyman, says, while The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas is 'a Holocaust story set in 1940s Germany, for me it is timeless'. He then cites 'such contemporary horrors as Rwanda, Darfur and Somalia' (4). In conceiving of the Holocaust as a historical horror story that keeps being repeated in different forms, we lose sight of the particularities of each of those events and this reduces our ability to properly understand any of them.Many well-intentioned initiatives to maintain the memory of the Holocaust end up relativising it and belittling the experiences of those who were persecuted, enslaved, gassed to death or forced to flee their home countries under the threat of extermination in Nazi concentration camps.Consider the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust in Britain for example. Each year, the trust comes up with a new theme for the memorial day, and these are conveyed to the public through simplistic slogans. This year's theme was 'Imagine, remember, reflect, react', while 2007's key message was 'same - but different'. The idea that the millions who perished in Europe in the 1930s and 40s were killed 'just because they were 'different'', as the trust put it, means reducing the anti-Semitism that gave rise to the Holocaust to just an extreme form of social exclusion.The New Labour government initiated Holocaust Memorial Day in 2001 and the trust's literature is littered with New Labourite buzzwords such as inclusion, crossing cultural barriers, celebrating difference, engaging disaffected youth, building respect and addressing bullying. Taking action on these issues has nothing to do with remembering the Holocaust, and everything to do with the government's crass community cohesion agenda.Yes, there are lessons to be learnt from the Holocaust and we should not forget that six million Jews and others were systematically slaughtered at the hands of the Nazis. But the reduction of the Holocaust to a political prop, to a morality lesson for the masses and a mere symbol of evil only serves to diminish the memory of its victims.While The Boy In the Striped Pyjamas takes a childish approach to the Holocaust, it seems most initiatives today to spread awareness of the subject treat us all as children who are incapable of understanding the political and moral complexity of this great atrocity.As for Grant, she only doubts the validity of making a Holocaust film for children because she believes that not even adults can be expected to understand it. As she puts it: 'We are ourselves too childlike to understand much of the great opaque experience of the Final Solution, with only occasional windows breaking through the stone walls of history. How can we expect children to understand what we do not?' (5) The mainstreaming of this demeaning attitude poses a greater threat to historical awareness and to the memory of the Holocaust than any single children's film could ever do.",Null,10,22,10 October 2008
The Artist," The Artist: giving film fans the silent treatment
","In this week's Monday edition of the famed entertainment trade-magazine Variety, Kim Novak - the now 78-year-old star of Hitchcock's Vertigo - paid for a full-page ad bearing the title 'I want to report a rape'. The piece lambasted Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist for its use of film composer Bernard Herrmann's 'Love Theme', which was originally written for Hitchcock's 1958 detective classic. Novak insisted that this was 'morally wrong' and that it was using the 'emotions it engenders as if it were their own'.Given that this piece of music has been used in countless films since Vertigo, this fierce tirade feels more than a little unwarranted. Nevertheless, The Artist does seem to be an inescapably derivative project.Hazanavicius' film is a black-and-white silent film about a black-and-white silent-film star, complete with a jazzy soundtrack and intertitles to spell out the dialogue. Not only does this feel a little gimmicky, but Hazanavicius also appears to have more or less lifted the plot from A Star is Born: George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the height of his fame when he decides to take aspiring starlet, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), under his wing. Unfortunately, with the invention of the talkies, the two trade places, for as George finds himself outdated and out of a job, Peppy becomes a star of the new medium.On the surface, The Artist seems like little more than a nostalgic exercise, its makers plundering the history of early Hollywood and using its imagery 'as if it were their own'. However, this really isn't the case. Deftly manipulating the conventions of the silent film, The Artist is, contrary to Novak's barbed comments, a piece of movie magic in its own right.The film begins with the premiere of one of George's hammy adventure flicks. Standing behind the screen as the end credits roll and the film's theme fades away, he waits to hear the audience's response. As we are deprived of diegetic sound, all we see is an elated George clench his fist and smile in triumph, until the camera cuts to the adoring audience standing and clapping to confirm that all has gone well. Despite going into The Artist fully aware it was a silent film, this initial moment still seemed bizarre and it was incredibly funny.With scenes like this, Hazanavicius plays with the audience to great effect, yet much of the humour also emanates from the way the characters themselves seem to know they are in a silent film. When George is first invited to see the early sound test for talking pictures, he dismisses them as a fad. Of course, he soon realises that his refusal to embrace this new form will destroy his career. In a hilarious dream sequence which follows, George ransacks his dressing room, terrorised by the sound the clattering items produce.Although this kind of self-aware schtick recurs throughout the film, Hazanavicius still manages to carve a moving story about the fickleness of showbusiness within his cartoonish world. George's whiskey-slicked slide into obscurity is truly heartbreaking and Jardin's performance - which earned him Best Actor award at Cannes last year - straddles parody and pathos with incredible dexterity.Due to its universal acclaim and considerable box-office success, The Artist has already been tipped as a serious Oscar contender this year. It has been invariably celebrated as a love letter to a bygone age of Hollywood. But more than merely indulging silent-film cliché, Hazanavicius has revitalised a lost art in commercial filmmaking: he has produced an irresistible and entertaining family feature that demands to be experienced in the cinema.",9,0,2,6 June 2012
Invictus," You need more than rugby to bury Apartheid
","'One Team, One Country.' The team was the Springboks; the country was South Africa. The slogan was the brainwave of Edward Griffiths, who was CEO of the South African rugby union and communications director of the South Africa rugby team during the 1995 World Cup.On 24 June 1995, 43million South Africans came together to watch the Springboks beat the New Zealand All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup final at the Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg. Invictus, a new film directed by Clint Eastwood and based on John Carlin's book Playing The Enemy, celebrates this feat as the crowning moment in Nelson Mandela's campaign to forge a new, democratic South Africa. Non-South Africans may wonder: why rugby?For South Africans, rugby is a big deal. It was the sport of the hated ruling Afrikaners and as much an icon of Apartheid as the orange-white- blue flag of the old regime or its national anthem 'Die Stem'. No black person would be associated with the sport on principle. Football was the game of black South Africa, while Indians, like my family, played cricket. Everyone (including all the prisoners incarcerated with Mandela on Robben Island) always supported the away-team against South Africa. My mother still supports England against South Africa – old habits die hard.As much as rugby was hated by the black majority, it inspired a religious fervour in the Afrikaners. They had suffered under the sports boycott that prevented South Africa from competing internationally in the one sport it excelled at. Mandela's eureka moment was to recognise that if he could win the hearts and minds of the Afrikaners through their one great passion, rugby, then governing the new South Africa would be a great deal easier. With the 1995 Rugby World Cup being held in South Africa, Mandela saw an ideal opportunity to unite the country. But winning over the black masses to his PR campaign was not going to be easy.The campaign around the Rugby World Cup reflected the realpolitik of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). During the struggle to overthrow Apartheid, the ANC had allied itself with the Communist Party (SACP) – and the SACP's rhetoric was far more effective at mobilising the black masses than the elitist middle-class nationalism of the ANC leadership. But in power, after the first democratic elections of 1994 following Mandela's release from prison in 1990, the ANC was eager to shake off its communist and working-class allies and build new alliances with the middle classes and capitalist elites in South Africa. What better means than rugby to achieve this new coalition?Invictus, Latin for 'unconquered', is the title of a short poem by the British poet William Ernest Henley. Mandela used to recite it to himself while in prison. Eastwood's film focuses on the build-up to the World Cup final and the developing bond between Springbok captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) and Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman). Damon is a convincing Afrikaner, while Freeman, who has been Oscar-nominated for his performance, is an uncanny look-a-like for Mandela. He's so impressive that I can forgive the odd lapse in pronunciation. It doesn't matter that he says 'perry' instead of 'petty' and 'Springbucks' instead of 'Springboks', because in every other way he is very credible.Alongside this pivotal relationship, there are some lighter comedic moments, too, like the understandably indignant reactions of the newly appointed black bodyguards who find themselves having to work alongside those who once protected FW de Klerk's Apartheid government. The white guards talk rugby; the blacks don't. They are puzzled by Mandela's newfound interest in the sport, especially when he overrides a decision by the militant government sports department to change the name of the team from the hated Springboks to the more neutral Proteas.Why take such a stubborn stand over such a petty issue, Mandela's secretary asks him? Mandela responds that if he can't face up to hard decisions now, then he never will. This recognition of the difficulty of forging a new alliance underpins the worldwide respect and admiration for Mandela.Towards the end of the film, a Boeing 747 flies low over Johannesburg; its thunderous roar terrifying the 62,000 in the stadium waiting for the big rugby final to start. Then, when the plane's underside with the words 'Good Luck Bokke' painted on it in giant black letters, become visible, terror turns to delight. Just before kick-off, Mandela walks on to the field to meet the Springboks team. 'Nelson, Nelson, Nelson' call the crowds ecstatically, and the chants are shown reverberating in living rooms and pubs around South Africa.I left the cinema feeling a little teary – but optimistic, too. It may be because as a South African living abroad at the time, I wasn't there when the masses celebrated Mandela's release; I wasn't there when the nation queued to vote in the first democratic election; and I missed this last euphoric moment when rugby briefly united a country.Today, it all feels like a long time ago. The assertion of ethnic rights, the desperate protests in the squatter camps and the squabble over resources in a period of global recession have seen to that. Will this year's football World Cup achieve something similar? Or is the belief that sport can bring unity and purpose to a divided country nothing but a chimera, like the rainbow that disappears when the sun is no longer shining?",9,0,1,22 June 2012
Super 8," Clichéd encounters of the Spielberg kind
","The old cliché that every story has already been told seems as pertinent as ever in Hollywood. A quick glance at the forthcoming releases reveals a bevy of rehashes, from Sherlock Holmes 2 to the upcoming Footloose remake. But Super 8 is different. It doesn't simply try to rehash; no, it attempts to reinvent the Spielberg formula for a new generation. Yet despite incorporating all the elements which made Spielberg's early movies so great, Super 8's endless references to these classics of family cinema only underlines its inability to measure up.Written and directed by JJ Abrams, Super 8 tells the story of 13-year- old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) who, while helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make a zombie flick on Super 8 millimeter film, witnesses a train crash which both releases a mysterious monster from one of the carriages and launches Joe into a classically Spielbergian adventure. Over its 112 minutes Joe strives to woo the girl of his dreams (Elle Fanning), discover the secret of the train's cargo and, when he has the time, help finish Charles's movie.In the past few years the name Steven Spielberg seems only ever to appear after the words 'Executive Producer', as if nowadays he's little more than a rubber stamp. However, in a film paying such obvious homage to Spielberg, his presence on the production staff is more than token. Spielberg's involvement serves as a validation of Super 8's blatant plagiarism. Because plagiarism is what it is. Everything, from the smalltown US setting to the BMXs Joe and his friends race around on, harks back to Spielberg's action-adventure opuses Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET the Extra-Terrestrial.Spielberg's stamp of approval also gives Abrams the space to employ this mode of film-within-a-film storytelling, denoted by the title, in a way that is unabashedly self-aware. There is absolutely nothing here which we haven't seen before, and Abrams knows it. Even Joe's tousled, mousey- brown mop makes him a dead ringer for Elliott, ET's 10-year-old protagonist. Yet it is these knowing nods to Abram's influences which allow the viewer to see past Super 8's lack of originality and enjoy it for what it is: a vehicle to relive those bygone moments of movie magic.The boys' persistence in making their film, despite the deaths and disappearances all around them, draws a smile even after the most fearsome set pieces. Only 24 hours after they narrowly escaped death at the train station, Charles and his crew rush, monster make-up in hand, back to the crash sight, hoping that the backdrop will give the film the 'production values' Charles is seeking.Moments like this indicate that this is a film not to be taken too seriously. Yet tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is not enough to sustain the entire movie, as becomes painfully clear halfway through. Then, with more and more townsfolk having disappeared, the zombie film is postponed and, with it, the loving homage ceases. From there on in, the plot descends into one all-too-familiar setpiece after another. And the moment Super 8 begins to take its own story seriously, it becomes the very thing it was trying to escape: being merely derivative.It doesn't help that while the setpieces are big and visually stunning, the pastiche which opens the film creates a barrier between the viewer and the action. The sense that it is all one big in-joke, full of film- buff allusions and references, makes it hard to really care about the fate of Joe and his friends. So although Super 8 is well acted and has decent dialogue, you find it hard to believe in either young Joel Courtney or Elle Fanning when, at the back of your mind, you know that they are not so much characters as ironic nods to a filmmaking past.The regurgitative approach to filmmaking Hollywood that has employed for the past few decades has left a creative vacuum. Whereas the likes of Close Encounters and ET made mainstream film an artistic medium, they seemed to prepare the way for a long chain of bad remakes. These attempts at giving the audience more of what they want has only left us pining for those old movies all the more. Super 8 may be a trip down memory lane, but it still struggles with this vicious cycle: it delights because of what it reminds us of, but fails to tell its own story.",5,4,6,20 June 2012
Titanic," Taking Titanic seriously will end in disaster
","The announcement that James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster, Titanic, was to be rereleased to mark the centenary of the ocean liner's disastrous maiden voyage was met with a considerable amount of vitriol from historians and cultural critics.Alongside the somewhat more sober events set to take place on 15 April to commemorate the sinking of the 'unsinkable ship' - including an exhibition in Belfast, where RMS Titanic was built, and a series of seminars in Nova Scotia, close to where it sank - many saw this as Cameron once again cashing in on the tragedy with his fiercely sentimental film. The fact that it has been remastered in 3D has made its release feel all the more in poor taste.I was all of six years old when Titanic first hit our screens. It was, of course, one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood. So large was its impact, in fact, that on several occasions during my schooling I was subjected to Titanic-themed history and art projects, all of which involved watching the three-and-a-bit-hour behemoth as a primary piece of research. In the years since, it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends. So I've seen it more times than I'd care to count. Seeing it remastered on the big screen, however, made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than ever.Given the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage, and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats, the Titanic tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time. Through the star-crossed, and completely fictional, love affair between penniless rogue Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and drippy debutante Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), Cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained. This rendering, however, is reductive to say the least: the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic, brandy-swilling poshos and the steerage is full of arm-wrestling Germanics and Guinness-guzzling Irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation. Probably the most coherent message about class we are given, as the two lovers move between their respective camps, is that it's much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviar.The stories that survived the ship's demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism. But Cameron's manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies. In its turbulent second half, poignant moments come thick and fast, but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The 'unsinkable' Molly Brown, who in the real tragedy insisted the half-full lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the ice-cold water, is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination. Similarly, as is widely known, the ship's string quartet played on top deck as the Titanic went down, in order to calm the passengers, but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz Cameron lays over the scene. As the quartet finish their rendition of 'Orpheus and Eurydice', one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says, 'Gentleman, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight'. Such candy-coated moments continually deaden the impact of the film's rich source material.Cameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the Titanic wreck came as part of the package, suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus. Indeed, given the director's famous meticulousness, the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places. Kate Winslet's accent is allowed to wander between American, Irish and English with little consequence, and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of Rose's malevolent fiancé Cal - which saw innumerable famous actors rejected - the appalling Billy Zane was selected, who ends up playing the role like a camp Count Dracula.Despite all this, the clunking one-liners, the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives Titanic its distinctive charm. When watching the released film on the big screen, I was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments, which also had kept me returning to it over the years. For myself and others it seems, this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turn-of-the-century tragedy. As such, criticising Titanic on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning Top Gun for giving a rose-tinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots - doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorable.I completely agree with those who feel Titanic has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy. Not because Cameron's tacky blockbuster does a disservice to the 1,517 people who lost their lives, but because this film is so inescapably naff that really it shouldn't be taken that seriously. I urge fans to go and enjoy this guilty pleasure with a clear conscience",6,2,4,6 June 2012
Crazy Heart," Crazy Heart: another Hollywood sermon
","Last Sunday, Jeff Bridges won an Oscar for his performance as Bad Blake, an ageing country-and-western star, in Crazy Heart. For me, about three- quarters into the film, which has a good soundtrack and some fine acting, I got the sinking feeling that I'd been tricked. A pretty good movie had turned into a grating sermon.Most movies about musicians show them trying to deal with pressures through booze and drugs, and inevitably self-destructing. But my own experience as a touring musician for 30 years is that while I've seen a few burnouts, they're a small minority. The smart ones quit their destructive habits - or quit touring. The even smarter ones learn how to pace themselves, and still have a good time. Watching Bad Blake chain- smoke and swill whisky, though, I would have bet any money that Hollywood wasn't going to let him out of this movie alive.For a while, things start looking up for Bad. He meets Jean, a rather implausibly young and attractive woman with a cute little son called Buddy. Will Bad be true to his name and blow it? Well, he almost does, when he drives his car off the road and wakes up in hospital. This is the moment of reckoning. His broken ankle will heal, the doctor says, but if he doesn't stop smoking and drinking and lose 25 pounds, he will soon die from cancer, emphysema, a stroke, or all three.Bad then leaves the hospital and promptly goes back on the sauce. I watched the film in New York, and there were audible groans as he lit a cigarette. I wanted to cheer, which I guess shows me up as an irredeemable degenerate. I apologise: it was becoming clear, at this point in the movie, that Bad was an alcoholic, and I know very well that an alcoholic is not a good thing to be. I know this because I've known a few alcoholics.So Bad has been warned, but will not listen. And here comes the thunderbolt. Bad is trusted to take his girlfriend's son out for the afternoon, but while he's ordering a drink, the kid wanders off.Never mind that this happens not in, say, a war zone, but in a shopping mall. Never mind that the shopping mall is teeming with security guards, who find little Buddy in about five minutes (after pausing briefly to lecture Bad about his drinking). Never mind that little boys will sometimes wander off if you take your eyes off them for three seconds. Never mind that this could have happened to anyone, even if they'd stopped to buy a Bible instead of a bourbon. Jean is outraged and the relationship is over.Once again, we expect Bad to crash and burn. But what actually happens is, given the politically correct climate of today's Hollywood, probably the only possible alternative: the polar opposite. Bad goes to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).I confess I have my own bias here. I'm convinced that many people are in AA for peculiar, narcissistic reasons. I've been to a few AA meetings myself, as a guest and observer, and they gave me the creeps. The people I've known who have quit drinking without AA have all seemed healthier and less neurotic, and it strikes me as sad that the only alternative to self-destruction should be a quasi-religious cult, with a Holy Book, a set of rules and its own Devil; booze continues to occupy a place of dark, exalted power in these peoples' lives.I'm not the first to point out that we live in strangely puritanical times, in which everything is seen as dangerously 'addictive' and the road to Redemption lies in therapy. Nevertheless, I try to put my personal reservations about AA aside when people say it has saved their lives. It's pretty hard to argue with that. Yet Crazy Heart does seem to me to reflect a climate in which people are obsessed with risk- prevention, in which children are wrapped in cotton wool, and no middle ground is seen between destructive excess and puritanical self-denial.Oddly enough, though, when Bad goes back to Jean, apologising from the bottom of his heart and promising to stay clean and sober, she rejects him. She rejects him even though he's willing to sacrifice the name he's always used and go back to the one he was christened with, which, of course, turns out to be something humble and vaguely funny: Otis.This was puzzling to me. Maybe she's one of those women who, having got the kind of nice, safe, unthreatening modern man she thought she wanted, doesn't find him so sexy any more. Maybe she's still punishing Bad/Otis for the shopping mall incident. Then again, maybe the filmmakers are punishing him for disobeying doctors' orders. One thing's for sure: while Bad may be better off without his drinking problem, all the colour, humour and fun seem to go out of the movie along with it. Bad may have been bad, but Otis is kind of boring.I suppose Crazy Heart is well-intentioned, and has a valid story to tell. But I wonder how many people were, like me, left pining for the kind of old Frank Sinatra movie in which an entertainer's life is one big party and people admire and envy him for it. I couldn't help trying to imagine Bad Blake as played by, say, Dean Martin or Robert Mitchum. And I couldn't help mentally writing my own alternate ending. Two of them, in fact.In the first one, Bad eases up on the gas pedal, loses 10 or 15 pounds (he really didn't need to lose 25), gets a shave and a decent haircut - and gets the girl. In the second, he roars off into the night, as ornery as ever, clutching a bottle of bourbon and telling us all to go to hell.",Null,1,2,22 June 2012
Prometheus," Prometheus: in space, old habits die hard
","It's no great insight to say that Hollywood seems to have run out of new ideas, but recently this has become embarrassingly evident.The past few years have seen a relentless succession of high-profile remakes and sequels. In a changing marketplace, in which big media companies continually refuse to adapt, film studios seem to have become increasingly reliant on the Sure Thing. The trouble is that as much as we may despise such shameless regurgitations, they tend to make an awful amount of money. The 2010 remake of Desmond Davis' 1981 fantasy classic, Clash of the Titans, was critically panned but made almost $500million at the box office; Men In Black 3 may have you craving to have your memory wiped by a secret agent, but has already brought in a cool $300million in its first few weeks.However, while this increasingly unimaginative atmosphere has produced a fair amount of tripe, certain genres seem to be able to provide the potential for quality as well as commercial viability. Alongside the irrepressible comic-book adaptations, science fiction has once again thrived with such prequels as JJ Abrams' Star Trek and Rupert Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes being greeted with critical acclaim as well as financial success.So it seems that a well-conceived science-fiction universe can provide ample fodder for worthwhile blockbusters. However, given the Alien franchise's steady decline over the past few years, Prometheus seemed to have its work cut out for it.Directed by blockbuster powerhouse Ridley Scott, Alien (1979) was a masterstroke of conceptual simplicity and stylish execution. The crew of a cargo ship unwittingly bring a beastly, man-eating alien on board and it picks them off, one by one, in a claustrophobic and spine-tingling couple of hours that quickly cemented itself in the Hollywood pantheon. Unfortunately, its brilliant simplicity also made it readily replicable. Aside from James Cameron's decent 1986 follow-up, Aliens, the same blueprint was marched out for a further two abysmal sequels. The 2000s saw the eponymous creature rear its ugly head twice more in the crossover catastrophes that were Alien vs. Predator and Alien vs. Predator: Requiem, which turned in a considerable profit margin despite being excruciatingly naff.It is with a certain trepidation that Scott has returned to the fold to direct this latest outing. Eager to distance himself from the franchise's formulaic trappings, and in lieu of making a direct prequel, Scott instead decides to focus on one unexplained aspect from Alien and expand it into a very different kind of story. In the 1979 original, the malevolent creature is brought on board the cargo ship, Nostromo, when the crew discover alien eggs in a crashed spaceship. As they explore the wreck, they also find the remains of a giant, fossilised creature, which sits in the ship's cockpit. Scott has said that the enigmatic 'space jockey', as it became known, has always bugged him, and this film sets out to explore its origin, setting a new group of characters on a distinctly more philosophical journey, which may hold the key to the meaning of human existence.The year is 2089 and archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a celestial map left by humanity's alien forbears in the ancient cave paintings of Earth. They are commissioned to lead a scientific expedition to follow the path the paintings lay out, taking them to a remote and desolate moon where they find the ruins of an ancient civilisation. Initially, Prometheus feels encouragingly different from the rest of the series. The journey the ship Prometheus takes is set up as a voyage of discovery rather than a voyage of the damned and, with stunning visual effects, Scott begins to craft a tantalising new world in the distant reaches of the Alien universe.Unfortunately, it isn't long before Scott begins falling into old habits. As they explore the ruins, the crew find more than they bargained for and unleash the wrath of the race they hoped would enlighten them. Thus, the film realigns itself with the very moulds it set out to break and Rapace, taking her lead from Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in the original series, is left to run around in blood-stained overalls, narrowly escaping the fate of her shipmates, who are all killed off in a range of rather unpleasant ways.The script then descends into a series of clanging nods to the original, with several scenes almost completely mirroring the most iconic moments of Alien. As it reaches its end, the film hastily returns to the philosophical questions it first posed, yet with so much time taken up in reliving former glories, this only serves to underline how quickly the film drifted away from what was supposed to set it apart.Recognising that a direct prequel would only lead him into all-too- familiar territory, Scott sidelines the iconic extra-terrestrial in order to tell a more human and complex story. Yet, in its almost compulsive backsliding into the Alien formula, Prometheus is little more than a tame rehash, whose only merit will be making an obscene amount of money.",6,2,3,20 June 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," A near triumph of style over substance
","Wes Anderson is one of the most polarising directors of his generation. Not that his work is particularly challenging. Far from it: for the majority of his career he has seemed content with trotting out the same kitschy and vaguely melancholic style which defined his Oscar-nominated 2001 film, The Royal Tenenbaums. Instead, what makes his output so difficult is that it's often rather difficult to like, with his self- aware, hipstery schtick seeming to obscure the fact that he isn't half as poignant a storyteller as he may like to think he is.With his 2004 critical and commercial flop, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the novelty finally wore off. And while 2007's Darjeeling Limited helped to regain much of his credibility, his true comeback came in the rather unlikely form of his stop-motion Roald Dahl adaptation, Fantastic Mr. Fox. In many ways, this unexpected side-step embodied many of the components which had already gone stale. It had the same rosy aesthetic, and the blank acting Anderson favours easily translated into monotone voice-acting and rigid puppetry. However, his characteristic mismatch of light superficial humour and moroseness proved to be the perfect marriage with Dahl's bittersweet narrative. While Anderson could often come undone when grappling with more distinctly adult characters, in a child-like but no less imaginative frame, his style took on a more unassuming charm.So it seems Anderson was always cut out for children's filmmaking. Not by contemporary standards, but like the more sinister Disney outings, in which happy-ever-afters only ever came after a decent amount of death and destitution, Anderson seems uniquely qualified to produce darkly moving films for youngsters.Distilling worldly themes into a cutesy tale, his latest outing, Moonrise Kingdom, stands somewhere in between Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Royal Tenenbaums. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a dejected orphan, knocked from pillar to post by social services and unfeeling foster parents. Pawned- off for the summer on a boy-scout troupe, Sam is shunned by his peers because of his violent outbursts, and hatches a plan to escape with his paramour, Suzy (Kara Hayward). Having met at a church pageant, the two begin exchanging letters and bond over their troubles. Suzy is similarly prone to violence and introversion and is kept at arm's length by her workaholic lawyer parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). Using Sam's newly acquired outdoorsman skills, they retrace an ancient Native American trail that leads to an untouched cove, Moonrise Kingdom, in which they hope they can live their lives free from the adult world.Set on a fictional New England island in 1965, the film unfurls in a kitschy, gooey-eyed haze. For those who feel Anderson is all style and no substance, the opening half provides little to convince you otherwise. The acting is muted, the dialogue taut, and Anderson's characteristic aesthetic is left to take centre stage. As such, the emotional core of the story is glossed over by a wash of primary colours and vintage décor, with a ludicrous outfit or a naff piece of Sixties wallpaper serving as weak visual punchlines that carry the film in its first few scenes.However, as the story develops, the stellar cast help to draw out the intricacies behind the characters' cartoonish exteriors. Bill Murray shines as Suzy's impassive and fraught father, while Bruce Willis puts in an affecting performance as the island's lovelorn cop. But it is the two young leads who truly steal the show. Anderson allows for little in the way of actorly flourish, yet both Gilman and Hayward come off diffident and damaged rather than merely blank, and as a result their blossoming romance feels surprisingly sincere.As Willis leads a troupe of deputised, and heavily armed, boy-scouts out in pursuit of the escaped lovers, the story takes darker turns. Blood is drawn, scouts walk away with stab wounds and a puppy loses its life, but the film retains a faint sense of ridiculousness that keeps proceedings light.Stylised to within an inch of its life, Moonrise Kingdom can feel like little more than self-indulgent filmmaking. But while it remains a whimsical, and at times, superficial fairy tale, it retains enough worldliness to make it an engaging film for children and adults alike.",7,10,19,12 June 2012
The Social Network," Facebook: the heart in a heartless world
","The great insight of David Fincher's brilliant The Social Network is that social inadequacy was the main driver of the Facebook juggernaut.The film kicks off in 2003 with the nerdy, OCDish Harvard student and future Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) meeting Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) for a date. After Zuckerburg fails to impress with his rat-a-tat-tat of facts and feelings - think The Simpsons' comic book guy mashed with Stephen Fry - Erica torpedoes him with one of the film's many memorable lines: 'You're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.'Facemash, via a couple of posh, handsome, Harvard twin brothers asking Zuckerberg to help them build a social-networking site for students, becomes Facebook - or TheFacebook, as it was originally known, before the founder of Napster, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), made his enormous contribution to the project. 'Drop the 'the'', he tells Mark. 'Makes it cleaner.' Initially a Harvard-based info-sharing site, Facebook, in Fincher's telling, is born directly from a student's need to hook up with people in some fashion, when so many of the traditional ways of doing so - meeting in bars, conversing face-to-face, joining clubs - are increasingly closed off to him. In this way, Fincher subtly yet profoundly captures what remains the lifeblood of the extraordinary Facebook phenomenon: not social inadequacy per se, but certainly social discombobulation.Written by Aaron Sorkin of West Wing fame and directed by Fincher of Seven fame, The Social Network focuses on the lawsuits filed against Zuckerberg in the mid- and late 2000s. With Facebook a household name and worth an estimated $25 billion (Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire ever), he was sued both by those posh twins, who claimed that he stole the idea from them after they asked him to construct a social-networking site, and by his best friend and the original funder of the Facebook project, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who is ruthlessly ousted by Zuckerberg as he gets closer to Parker the Napster maestro.The Social Network taps into what has made Facebook so popular: the desire to carve out an identity, a life narrative, at a time when it seems increasingly hard to do that through real social relationships in the real world. 'People lived on farms and then in cities and now they will live on the internet', says Parker. He says it's no longer enough just to go to a party – you must 'go to a party with a digital camera and share the photos on Facebook'. Everything – from their job title to their interests, their relationship status to their religious beliefs, their social antics to their childrearing experiences – gets recorded and logged by the FB generation, as a kind of makeshift but also permanent personal narrative, which tells everyone who they are and what they believe.This is what is really significant about Facebook starting off as a university phenomenon before spreading to the rest of society. At uni, people's cultivation of a personal identity is necessarily a bit forced. Lacking the social cachet that goes with having a certain kind of job, living in a certain kind of neighbourhood, and moving in certain kinds of adult social circles, students instead physically sign up for societies or join clearly demarcated and often caricatured social networks (the Rugby Drinkers, the Political Club) to demonstrate who they think they are. Today, in the absence of the old solidarities and the old informal networks of community and shared interests – that is, at a time of great alienation – that experience of needing fairly self- consciously to magic up an identity is repeated across society. So a fundamentally student site now has half a billion members.Facebook is better understood, not as a country, but as a refugee camp for people who feel today's lack of identity-forging social experience. The scene in which Zuckerberg tries to befriend – or rather 'friend' – Erica on FB after their disastrous date and his pathetic apology, where he keeps hitting the F5 refresh button to see if she has accepted, is as painful a study of alienation as you are likely to see in the cinema this year. An intelligent, funny and humane exploration of society's new networks – if I were on Facebook, I'd definitely 'Like' this film.",10,2,4,22 June 2012
