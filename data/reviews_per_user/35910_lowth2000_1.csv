The Devil's Advocate," Moderately good film
","This is a reasonable film with a good cast.  It has a good basic idea and an intreaging plot.  The first half of the film is really rather good but the second half is a little predictable, far fetched, and a bit dissapointing. Al Pachino, as ever is very good but Keanu is rather poor.  Keanu's accent varies quite a bit and the plot seems a little tame and blunted.It's an enjoyable film to watch.-John",7,0,1,25 July 2001
