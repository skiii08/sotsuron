It," Much better than expected.
","The child actors are pretty much the stars of this movie. The original put more focus on tension building and specifically Pennywise (played by the great Tim Curry). This is where the remake is different in a good and bad way. The good thing is that the pace of the remake is better, in my opinion. The bad thing is that the new Pennywise isn't nearly as scary as Curry's version.When I first heard about a remake being made, I thought to myself: Not another stupid remake. Truthfully, this one wasn't actually that bad. Now that almost 30 years have passed since the original, technology has advanced and many things just look way better than they used to in front of the camera.This movie's actually funny at times. I don't remember finding things funny with the first one, but of course I watched that one when I was 10. Remember how everyone who has seen the movie at a young age describes it at traumatising?Anyways, even if a remake - still better than most stupid horror flicks. Probably thanks to Cary Joji Fukunaga (writer, producer, True Detective-creator).6.8/10 way better than expected.",Null,1,3,28 October 2017
American Sniper," I would give it negative 1000 stars if I could
","I watched this sorry excuse for a film only to see how much crappy propaganda
Eastwood was able to incorporate. As a kid I used to adore Eastwood and his overly *masculine* (judge, jury and executioner) personas in movies. That is not the case anymore. Eastwood has always been a political hard-liner.. on (Firefox) and off the screen. Taking political views into consideration, C. Eastwood and Ch. Heston could've been brothers. I don't know why, but in recent years (and projects) Eastwood has been focusing more than ever on one-sided portrayals of Americans being the heroes. In my humble opinion CHRIS KYLE IS NOT AND NEVER WILL BE A HERO. A person with so many kills on his belt is A KILLER PURE AND SIMPLE, NOT A HERO.
Also, don't let me get started on B. Cooper. Personally, I think the guy has a terrible vibe. To me he seems incredibly ignorant, arrogant, selfish etc. All in all, just a horrible human being. One of the most unsympathetic people I've ever seen on screen. Enough about Cooper.. he doesn't deserve more of my attention.Let's have a look at CE's last 5 movies..J. Edgar = probably a good portrayal of Hoover, since the guy must've been a complete psychopath. Still one of Eastwood's worst movies.
Jersey Boys = the exception here .. not bad, but not great either
Sully = boring boring boring boring .. only for U.S. audiences. A pilot did his job and landed a plane. Wow. How mesmerising.
15:17 to Paris = one isolated incident turned into something epic .. propaganda in its purest form .. some of it may actually be factual. I'm pretty sure there's been a similar (or even better) story somewhere in history not involving U.S. soldier's on a train. Why not tell that?..and this pile of crap.A couple of questions regarding Hollywood movies/blockbusters:<ul><li>When there's an alien invasion or attack of any kind,</li></ul>why do these events always happen in the U.S. ?
<ul><li>Why is the U.S. always portrayed as the world leader and/or hero in such situations?</li></ul>Furthermore, something to think about:<ul><li>Americans (U.S. citizens especially) are among the dumbest, least educated nations in the world. They may have some of the best schools/universities in the world, but only a small number of the world's population is actually allowed to attend, rendering their over-priced existence insignificant. The *normal* school system over there is horrible. Designed to manipulate more than educate.</li></ul>Nuff said..",1,3,31,9 December 2018
Baby Driver," What a heist movie should be..
","Baby Driver by Edgar Wright (Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz, World's End, Scott Pilgrim) is one thing first and foremost: a lot of action, pace and fun. Ansel Elgort (weird last name, can't get over it) plays a younger getaway driver with a tragic past. Kevin Spacey plays the boss, Jon Hamm and the hot Eiza Gonzalez are a Bonnie and Clyde-type couple, Jamie Foxx a trigger-happy lowlife criminal with Jon Bernthal rounding up the bunch of criminals. Lily James is the main characters' love interest. Altogether, a very good cast.Adding Mr. Wright's directing skills and a great soundtrack and you got yourself a very entertaining heist movie. There are hardly any boring moments, which is very essential and the scenes involving cars and driving (a very big part of the movie) are terrific. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed car chases as much in a movie. Great entertainment. 7.4/10",7,2,7,13 September 2017
Split," Taking DID to a whole.. new.. level.
","This movie turns dark .. then darker .. then darkest .. very fast. When first watching I had the impression it wouldn't go supernatural, but it does, which is definitely a good thing. I'm not a fan of Shyalaman, but this is definitely part of his better accomplishments like The Village or Unbreakable. In my opinion, The Sixth Sense is not as good as everyone said (or thought) it was.I don't like the fact that Shyalaman has been compared to Hitchcock all this time. I get the influences and parallels, but these two are very separate to me. Shyalaman will never reach Hitchcock-status. McAvoy is very good in this, which is no surprise. Taylor-Joy is a good choice.Also look out for an interesting cameo (and revelation) at the end.All in all, a pleasant and unexpected surprise. 6.9/10.",7,2,11,4 April 2017
War of the Worlds," Terrible movie. Could've been so much better.
","It's 45 to midnight and war of the worlds is on TV. I watched it back in 05 and I decided to rip this movie apart, because I remember it crushing my expectations back then. I expected a lot and Spielberg failed to deliver on almost every count. 1. Tom Cruise - I think any other actor would've been better for the role. 2. Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin - interestingly both kids are annoying in this. The girl far worse than the boy. 3. The absurdity of certain scenes with depiction of mass panic and mayhem. There is one scene, where a guy is trying to get into the car through a hole in the front, and he's cutting his hands and fingers while breaking the glass open, but he's still going on.. terrible. 4. They should've written something else. The whole estranged-father-routine is a bad fit. These are only a few reasons I could think of right away. This movie is very flawed and not worth my precious time.There were some scenes that were actually OK. And yeah, I liked the tripods. All in all, extremely dissatisfying. I think one would be better off listening to Welles' radio drama program. H.G. Wells is turning in his grave. Shame on you Spielberg.I'm giving it 1 star. I've never given one star, but since this movie had like a gazillion dollar budget, I think 1 star is very appropriate.",1,2,5,1 February 2017
12 Years a Slave," Roots on crack.
","What else is there to be said about 12 years a slave that hasn't been said already?Great direction, great performances, great story (it is to be argued how true). It's interesting that most of the roles are played by non-American actors. Hell, even the director is British. The injustice of this story is heartbreaking to say the least. The quality of this picture is undeniable. One could argue that it's one of many to come as part of Hollywood's atonement series for America's sins of the past, but it's not important why it's been made and why it came at that exact moment in time. It should've been done a long time ago. 8.1/10",8,1,3,28 August 2017
Sausage Party," Fun. Nothing more. And not for kids.
","So many 1-star-votes out there and this is still getting a 6.3 rating? Absolutely deserved. Why? Because there's enough people out there who understood that this is intended as pure fun and nothing more. All the people feeling *offended* by the *racial* profanity or otherwise are over-sensitive suckers. I especially liked the developing friendship between the obviously Palestinian (muslim) lavash and the Israeli (jewish) bagel. The sheer tidal wave of double entendres is amazing.One quote kinda grew on me: *Sausage, I relish (relish) the fact that you mustered (mustard) the strength to catch up (ketchup) to me.* Good stuff. Don't care what anyone says. Liked it because it's profane and dirty. 6.0/10",6,0,2,23 February 2017
Life," So many mistakes. On and off camera.
","This movie is so flawed, I don't even know where to begin. I mean, the six astronauts are the most stupid bunch of people I've seen on screen in a long while. Apart from the fact that this copies a lot from movies like Gravity (the effects, colors) The Thing, Alien (theme) etc., this film still manages to lower the bar even further down into oblivion. There's this one scene which kinda tells you how terrible this is. In the course of the first 15-20 minutes, the paraplegic biologist revives the organism by jolting it with electricity, only for it to almost devour his hand within an instant. After awhile when the crew tries to revive him they realize that the creature has latched onto him, feeding off of him. In that moment the crew captain (played by Rebecca Ferguson) decides to do the most incredible thing. Just shock it a little bit more with even more voltage and let it absorb more energy. Now how stupid is that.Ryan Reynolds' character dies relatively early, which is fine since the character wasn't needed in the first place. The script sucked terribly. I think this could've been made without a script. No character development at all. Considering the not so small budget and the people involved in making this, I gotta say it's a horribly underwhelming effort. The only thing I liked about it was the ending. Bad endings are good, since there aren't many to begin with. Since this wasn't a box office success, there's not much hope for a sequel. 3.9/10 for the creature and the ending.",4,5,10,2 June 2017
Alien: Covenant," Probably the worst Alien movie ever.
","This franchise should've ended a long time ago. OK, the first one's a classic, the second one was terribly trashy, the third one was better, but got butchered by the editors and producers. Resurrection was incredibly unnecessary. The Vs. predator films are mediocre at best and mostly copies of their predecessors. Prometheus actually surprised me by not being bad at all, while not really adding anything new to the story. Covenant is a complete miss.There are so many things wrong with Covenant, it's mind-blowing. I'm not really in the mood to go much into detail, because it's not worth the time or attention. 5.2/10",5,0,6,27 June 2017
