Minority Report," PLOT HOLES
","*May contain mild spoliers, please click away*1. If the Pre-Cogs can only see murders, how can Agatha tell about the umbrella, the homeless man, and the balloon man in the scene where the cops chase them through the mall?2. If Anderton is a murder suspect, wouldn't they take his retina ID off the register to get into the Temple?3. Early on in the movie we see the balls are released early in the sequence of events. If this is true, then wouldn't the balls with `Lamar Burgess' written on them drop in the fake echo?4. How can Lamar fake a cerebral output with such detail about who would be in the room and at what time?5. In a world where people are ID'd wherever they go and everything is on computers, why couldn't the PreCrime have made it to Leo Crow's hotel room in time when his name was on a computerized registry? They know the location of all the merry go rounds, yet they can't find Crow's name in a registry?",1,41,88,22 June 2002
