Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Amazingly funny, a true original.
","Borat is an amazingly funny movie. The mere awkwardness of it is enough to make the most uptight of people giggle. An open mind and ready to laugh attitude is all thats needed when you see this movie. Don't even bother bringing popcorn you won't have time to eat it in between fits of laughter. It's an original idea that is sure to be copied in the near future... I encourage everyone of suitable age to see this movie, and to also take it with a grain of salt. There are a few nude scenes and in no way the ones anyone would want to see. There is a wrestling match between Borat and Azamat, over a Baywatch magazine. It's a blur of hair, fat, sweat, and testicles. But it's quite funny if you ask me.",10,1,21,9 November 2006
