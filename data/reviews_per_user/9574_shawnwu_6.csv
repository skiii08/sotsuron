Hereditary," Shocking and Beautiful
","Hereditary was a terrifying blend of reality and the supernatural, with the horror stemming from the realism. The film was most terrifying when wallowing in the stress of tragic events and their effects on a strained family dynamic. Toni Collette and Alex Wolff delivered gut-wrenching performances as mother and son faced with impossible situations. The film also continuously hinted at an ambitious mythology that provided suspense, but in the last five minutes it felt the need to tie up the mystery with an over-explained sequence that read more like a conclusion to a Law and Order episode than the end to an otherwise excellent film. In all, the film was shocking and beautiful, but suffered from its last minute tonal shift.",8,2,5,11 June 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Civil Bore
","Civil War is a disgustingly contrived bore that champions the moral that the friendships of the powerful few triumph over the lives of the many. 117 sovereign nations come together to craft a peaceful treaty to reign in the Avengers, but Captain America decides his life's calling is to reject any limit to his authority. The fight between allies was as pointless as Batman V. Superman, yet somehow worse, and the comedy lacked its typical punch. The only redeemable part of this movie was the Black Panther, a character with rational thought and believable justifications, but he is practically drowned in the catastrophic melting pot that is Captain America: Civil War.https://twitter.com/thetaketweets http://filmtake.tumblr.com/",3,19,40,8 May 2016
Get Out," Delivering both on the expectations of the genre and the comedic expectations of a Jordan Peele creation, GET OUT is simply amazing.
","Jordan Peele's directorial debut is an exhilarating horror thriller that also manages to spark laughter and comment on social issues. The cinematography, tropes, and soundtrack echo horror, but the film finds abundant moments of comic relief like when a father reassures the main character he isn't racist by claiming, 'I would have voted for Obama for a third term.' Before the plot delves into a traditional horror frenzy, it mines the horrors of racism. The social commentary plays on audience expectations and results in both humor and suspense. Delivering both on the expectations of the genre and the comedic expectations of a Jordan Peele creation, GET OUT is simply amazing.",8,109,228,21 February 2017
La La Land," La La Land was a captivating sensory adventure
","The world was magical, so I put up with intermittent excessive song and dance. An ever-present current of warm piano gave the film a sense of unity that felt reminiscent of Chazelle's prior film, Whiplash. I did not care much for the bland characters and their cliché plights, but Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were not the central characters of this film...the sets, the music, and Los Angeles were the focus. Over time, my affinity for the film has dwindled, but that does not discredit the pleasure I had in watching it for the first time. As a whole La La Land was a captivating sensory adventure that was pleasing from start to finish.",8,1,9,30 January 2017
Finding Dory," Finding Dory is a spy thriller with fish
","Beneath its cute facade, Finding Dory is a spy thriller. Impulsive and daring Dory (swimming not stirred) must stealthily navigate the secret tunnels of the Marine Life Institute. A horn-heavy soundtrack and Sia's belting rendition of Unforgettable would effortlessly fit into any Bond film. Instead of Q, Dory has Hank, the 'septopus' who can assume perfect camouflage, drink coffee, and drive vehicles. Like any spy thriller, Finding Dory was at times ridiculous and far-fetched, but it was also riveting. However, instead of saving the world, Dory is happy to focus on finding her family.The Take: We're not movie critics, but we might be better. https://twitter.com/thetaketweets http://filmtake.tumblr.com/",7,1,9,24 June 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I had the lowest expectations ever for this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was decently entertaining.
","Batman V Superman, otherwise known asÂ… the Battle of the Butt Chins. I had the lowest expectations ever for this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was decently entertaining. I was sure that it would be a movie only built to advertise sequels, but happily it took the path of telling a complete (but not severely substantial) story. Many parts were cheesy and over dramatic, but how can you fault a superhero movie for that? Batman, Superman, Lex Luther, and Wonderwoman were all introduced well and became semi-interesting characters. The most intriguing aspect of the movie, however, was its ability to recruit nearly every Cable TV newscaster to make a brief cameo. The Take: We're not movie critics, but we might be better. https://twitter.com/thetaketweets http://filmtake.tumblr.com/",5,2,3,21 February 2017
