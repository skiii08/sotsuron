Requiem for a Dream," No desire to see it ever again...not because it was bad...
","...but because it was so good! It's so heartbreaking and sad to see a film as powerful and numbing as this. What really jumps out at you in the end, is that you can't simply say to yourself 'whew, at least these are just characters and a fake plot', then close your eyes and go to sleep. It sticks with you because you realize that this is not a story of fictional circumstances, but that there are people every day living the nightmare that these four went through, and in the end, all their potential is lost. That is what makes this film such a bittersweet triumph.I got laughed at by some friends when I told them how after watching this, I'd be surprised if anybody would want to do drugs. And frankly, if you DO still want to do drugs after a viewing of this film, there is something wrong with *YOU*. But personally, I really like my arm, and would like to keep it there.Sad, yet enlightening. It is a film that gave me such a numb, humbling feeling that I have no desire to relive the feelings it gave me. Only the best films can do that.",10,2,4,8 February 2007
American Beauty," Scirpt seemed to be written by a ten year old.
","First, I will admit, the only thing I really enjoyed about this movie was Kevin Spacey's incredible performance. He is the only thing that carries the film.However, the dialog was completely unbelievable, and had too much of an art-sy feel to it. It was too written and predictable. The plot, I thought had some pretty interesting turns, like the way events and circumstances led Chris Cooper to think his son was gay.Altogether, I found it unfulfilling, and trying too hard to prove suburbia is something that it really isn't in 80% of America, and a script that was obviously written by someone who hadn't been inside a modern American high school in 30 years.Best Picture of the year, my a$$. Sixth Sense should've taken this over.",4,1,5,29 November 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," AFI is for pansies...
","FINALLY! A site that got it right. The ranking on this couldn't be more accurate. A wonderful movie that never once feels slow, pointless, overdone, or simply, bad. It does everything right, and is a crime that this had to go up against Forrest Gump in the same year, and a shame it was so overlooked.What we have here is a masterpiece of film, something that just makes you feel better leaving the theater than you did going in. It builds up to a man's ultimate triumph over wrong, and the best BEST ending of a film ever.Perfect, as has been stated by 99.9% of people here. Because it is.If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this (for shame!), to quote will Ferrel: 'Go immediately to where ever movies are made-, sold or rented, and watch it. It is delightful'",10,0,0,17 July 2006
V for Vendetta," A for Awful, no remnants of Alan Moore's masterwork in 'this vicious cabaret'
","Complete joke. If people would read more they would know that this was a bastardized, modernized, canonized version of a great work by the finest author of graphic novels of the last twenty-five years (sorry Frank Miller).All the layered stories and symbolism that made the book such a joy have been removed and turned into a more cookie-cutter, user-friendly action flick that promoted stylized violence over stylized plot. That is it's biggest fault. Characters thrown around and placed wherever for whatever reason (evey never even meets Gordon until halfway through the book).V was not a freedom fighter, he openly admits in the book that he has turned from that brand of justice, and is in fact, an anarchist. Changing your view a little? This provided so much more depth to the dialogs in the book and made v into more of a character than a run-of-the-mill 'I been done wrong by my gov't so now I'm gonna fight for FREEDOM!' Prothero's doll burning (which was way cooler and way funnier than 'v shows up, hello commander, kills him), Beethoven's fifth (da da da dum, is morse code for V), the subplot of almond's widow as she ends up gunning down Mr. Susan (not Sutler!) the Leader. It goes on and on.And the stuff that wasn't in the book, the count of monte cristo? An SNL type show where the audience is held at gunpoint? Where the he11 did this come from? It neither helped the ideals nor had the amount of symbolism that Moore included is his original. And when it comes to Moore, don't mess with perfection.Avoiding the political slant, in which this was obviously and shamelessly pointed toward current events, the book was anarchy-vs-totalitarianism. This was material that was dated, but the screen writers saw a story that at it's bone was man vs gov't and decided they could twist a story that in all reality has nothing to do with current events and keep alive a spirit that was never there to begin with.Exploited violence with a paper thin plot so overdone over the years it's a surprise it hasn't torn yet. Read the book, shun this disgrace of a film. Nothing more than a 'vicious cabaret' (don't get it? Read the #@%$! book!)England prevails, this doesn't.",2,10,20,28 July 2006
