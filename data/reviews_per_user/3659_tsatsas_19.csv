Catch Me If You Can," Spielbergs Jack-Pot
","The latest in Spielberg filmmaking, and clearly not what you expect. `Catch me if you can' gives something a lot more than your usual family movie time in which Mr. Spielberg is so clearly great at delivering. The film sees Leonardo Dicaprio play a young con artist who successfully became a millionaire by forging checks all before his 19th birthday. An interesting game of cat and mouse begins when a determined FBI agent finds it in himself to devote his work into catching the youngster before he gets himself into more trouble. Instead we see our director taking a different approach in his career by exploring the undoubtedly entertaining scenarios that sees our lovable character go over the edge into sadness and fear. Dicaprios outstanding performance as a confused minor certainly gains our sympathy as he lives his life with his money and games along with his struggling attempts to accept his parents divorce. We are all reminded throughout the film of his characters undying love for both his parents and most of all to his father, whose unforgettable performance belongs to Christopher Walken. Tom Hank's sophisticated performance of the man hot on his trail is definitely something we are all expecting from the well know actor. I always felt that Spielberg's movies were never to be taken seriously although at every climax the audience is unwillingly left with something special they can take home with them. Unlike most Spielberg films, this movie will leave you with a lot to think about with open arms to whatever this smiling piece has to offer you by the time the end credits hit the screen.",Null,0,1,28 February 2003
Se7en," Modern Masterpiece!!
","Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting. David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.",10,338,415,20 June 2002
Final Destination 2," Your typical Sequal
","Death is back with a vengeance in this new tale of escaping the inevitable, as director David R. Ellis takes the front with an attempt to fill in the shoes of the witty success `Final Destination' so cleverly brought us. `Final Destination 2' brings us a new story of it all, following a young women's pre-vision of a horrific car crash and her escape from the jaws of death along with other feeble characters who were conveniently at the right place at the wrong time. You can pretty much guess the rest if you've all seen the first movie that was so unique in delivering a fresh taste into the world of horror creating our perfect Friday night popcorn enjoyments. This is a predictable sequel that clearly decided to pawn off all the great elements that the first film had for us and polish the scenarios up tightly to create a film that is bloodier, cheesier and flat. Expect more original death scenes as death decides to off every character using everything from barbecue grills to falling objects. The cast unfortunately wasn't decent either; the story left us with a bunch of rejects from the first movie that obviously never made it to the audition. Their attempts to play characters whose fates were entwined by death along with their flaccid abilities to portray fear was insulting to the movie viewers eye. This film almost directly disregards everything the first film stood for by trying to resurrect the scenarios and attempting to continue the story of the first film that was clearly finished years ago. If you enjoyed the first film so much then clearly this film will ruin the affect of everything the first film gave you. `Final Destination 2' is a definitive example of why most sequels are regarded as trash. The film is nothing more than a semi- decent video rental that tried so hard to better the original.",Null,0,0,19 April 2003
The Bourne Ultimatum," More of the same makes this top notch fun!
","The last time we saw Jason Bourne, he was on a search to find the one's who killed his girlfriend, finding those responsible he dealt with them. Before that he was on a path to recovering his mind with questions flying everywhere. Fighting his way through two movies with a strong silent sadness, we all know what he's after. Answers. Where did he come from? How was he made? Is he just the product of a company running experiments on mind control, or is he something special? This is a man, who can't remember his past, or how he can kill the way he does. All he wants to do is rememberand he wants it very, very badly. If you've been living in a place that doesn't recognize some of the best spy-thrillers in recent years, The Bourne franchise is an espionage Hollywood actioner based on the books by Robert Ludlum, and helmed by director Doug (Swingers) Liman and since the second film, Brit maker Paul Greengrass. What makes these films affective is that it is blockbuster action, done by filmmakers who are very comfortable in the low budget independent world of film-making. Without the use of over the top special affects and unbelievable plot lines, we have a new franchise that is taking things back to basics, successfully drawing in the audience with its powerhouse rawness and suspense high enough that the skin around the tips of your fingers will surely bleed due to the absence of fingernails. So in the third and unlikely final installment of this now trilogy, how does director Paul Greengrass keep the hits coming? Merely days after The Bourne Supremacy, Bourne gets sucked into the killing of a British Journalist who was close to uncovering the truth behind the CIA's involvement within the Treadstone project. A new conspiracy emerges, people start chasing him again, and so Bourne follows his new leads with the help of some old friends. The story gives the audience answers, and since Greengrass has more than proved how capable he is at handling this material ('Supremacy', 'United 93' anyone?) he raises the bar with the action even higher. The film moves with a pace so fast you can get lost in where a cut is made in the editing, and where another begins. The shaky camera work (although hated by many) stems from an independent field of movie making which beautifully and sometimes disturbingly puts the audience right in the middle of Bourne's confrontations. This is more than 'edge of your seat action'; this is an adrenaline cocktail of stunning camera work, great choreography and state of the art stunt work. Its swallows other films of the genre with an expressionless modesty, with the director unwillingly proving to us something he already knew long before we did. Paul Greengrass has to be the most promising filmmaker of the genre today, and his time to shine is very much upon us. With a satisfying gulp of closure oozing down the throats of those going to see The Bourne Ultimatum, the long hard impatient time of waiting for the follow up will begin the moment the credits role. Or if we are lucky enough, our man from London may grab the reigns of another soon to be made project, which will undoubtedly hold infinite possibilities in the progression of indie film-making, and some solid action movies. This films holds a lot of what many of us have been waiting for, and feeds us more Bourne than many of us will know how to chew. An action trilogy is now complete, yet many of us will still shout out 'Bring on Bourne 4', oh please do.",9,1,3,20 August 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," No argument about it... it's good!!
","After years of waiting, it seemed that one of the most magnificent Science fiction movie franchises of all time was set to rest and lay as nothing but a dusty piece of old gold in the treasure chest. Now in 2003, director Jonathon Mostow attempts to pump up the volume as he tries to fit the classic shoes James Cameron was made to wear in the director's chair of the Terminator franchise. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a desperate attempt to revive the all time classic story of war against the machines, once again bringing back big `Arnie' in the role we all love to remember him by. As a huge fan of the previous films I had been waiting for T3 ever since the credits rolled at the end of Terminator 2. With the thick perfect story that ended the second film, how can the generation of film lovers get it all back in 2003. Without a single tone of regret I can say it was all made possible in this years hit movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a worthy sequel that treads carefully on science fiction grounds without trying to be too cocky. Now with use of more enhanced CGI effects, the story can be told with a deeper sense of visionary and style. With a neat plot that pushes the story of it's predecessor further without it seeming ridiculous, fans of the movies can walk out grinning with the fact that they finally know how the whole story ends. It's a charm to once again see `Arnie' in the boots that he was born to wear. He is without doubt the character he plays and never fails to deliver the comic relief and the sheer guts the role brings out in him.The new `Terminatrix' was a daring original touch of careful script work that succeeded in giving something new to the whole Terminator story. The life of our human hero `John Connor' was a story just waiting to be told, and this film gives us that extra insight into the characters dilemmas and fate. `Nick Stahl' gives a worthy performance as the soon to be future fighter, although my mind couldn't help but wish `Edward Furlong' stepped back into the role that made the character so natural and innocent, as well as head strong and courageous. After all said and done, I can't debate which film of the now trilogy stands superior to the other two. `Rise of the Machines' tops it all off with a great climax with even decent potential for another film that could be fantastic. Although I am as satisfied as I am with the result, there still stands the most important question this film continuously resurrects. How would the film had turned out if it's original creator `James Cameron' had once again stepped in to direct and finish a complete trilogy? The answer we'll never know, but while you think about it, check out Jonathon Mostow's vision, it ain't at all bad.",Null,0,0,22 August 2003
The Usual Suspects," Usual suspected review
","Bryan singer directs Christopher McQuarrie's unique story following 5 criminals, one dope deal, one ambitious cops search for the truth and an anonymous crime lord. The Usual Suspects gave the 1990's back those masterpieces that had those amazing ironic climaxes like in 'The Third Man' and gave a new meaning to those movies that most people may consider 'weird', when in fact they just didn't understand a thing. The Usual suspects is not your usual film, and will probably need a second viewing in order to fill in the gaps in your mind as well as the questions that hit you time after time. What makes this film so great? Well the fact the story does nothing but puzzle you the entire 102 minutes. The last 2 minutes of the climax will leave most of your questions answered and you can lean back in your seat holding your head thinking 'what a great movie that was, but I think I have to watch it again cos there was something I didn't quite understand'.Another thing is about the movie is the fact that no matter how many times you watch it, you always seem to pickup something you didn't quite understand or realize. The scenes don't get boring, the action doesn't just jump in at the opening scene, the films is filled with those catchy film dialogues that are nothing but great, and the climatic twist will leave most of you banging your heads with frustration because you had no idea what was coming to you. The well-chosen cast sinks into the plot and is so well constructed and believable that you're going to hope its all fiction. Are there a few words to describe this masterpiece? I like to believe there are a few for every movie. Ironic, suspenseful, mysterious, classic and cool. This film marked the beginning of a new perspective in the crime thrillers we all love to watch, and I strongly believe that it is a classic that we can all compare other movies too.",10,0,1,4 June 2002
28 Days Later...," Taking a step Forward, In style
","From the director of  `Trainspotting' and `The Beach' comes a satisfying original horror movie filled with all the suspense and all the fun. Director Danny Boyle delivers to the audience your pretty standard zombie flicks that we used to watch on late night TV. With a few great special affects and catchy cinematography, the director turns your average late night movie into something else entirely. 28 days later revolves around the all-popular plot of survival during zombie-infested moments. When a young man wakes up in a hospital bed to an empty quiet London city and not a soul in sight, havoc begins when he realizes that the city has been over run by flesh eating psychotic human beings (zombies). The plot revolving around something I'm pretty sure we've all seen before and laughed at is sophisticatedly spiced up with raw cinematography and clever work of sound and lighting that sets the scene perfectly.The compelling performances by an excellent cast along with the powerful message the plot attempts to send out can only succeed in burying us in our seats as we nervously bite our nails till the film is finished.With an open mind along for the ride I can definitely say that you can walk off feeling you watched a pretty darn good horror movie, that stays loyal to the likes of classics such `Night Of The Living Dead' without trying to be to much that it isn't. Could this be the beginning of the genre moving ahead with originality, without breaking the rules that make horror films so satisfying?

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Motion Picture History In The Making!!!!
","A cinematic landmark that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the full-length feature. The Two Towers roars through the cinemas with a simple conclusion that can be determined as soon as the lights go up and people start getting up from there seats to leave. This is without doubt `The greatest film of 2002' and following The Fellowship of The Ring with only one eagerly awaited film left to go, this soon to be trilogy has massive potential to be the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. Taking its place alongside the Godfather trilogy and the Starwars saga these films are razor sharp with a mind blowing plot and dazzling performances. The Two Towers pretty much leaves where there Fellowship left off, expanding the horizons of the middle earth setting with more jaw dropping scenery, greater character development, fierce tense action scenes and plenty of mouth watering computer effects. J.R.R Tolkien had a great vision and an amazing story to tell and with the help of master director Peter Jackson, `The Two Towers' succeeds in every aspect a film should do. It'll be almost impossible to track down any faults that could have been erased to better this movie. This is pure magic, brilliant stuff!!!",10,0,0,20 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Very poor effort
","This poor attempt to recapture the episode VII fun has fallen short as nothing but a borderline offensive attempt to subversify a beloved franchise. Our new and intriguing characters that were introduced in the previous movie have now been spoilt and left with no intruigue and very little sympathy.Luke's return was a huge let down, Leia's role in the picture seems drawn out and just purely dull. The best part of the whole movie was Yoda's 30secods of screen time. Nothing seems fresh anymore in the Star Wars universe and it's going to take some real ingenuity to reignite this story and put it back on track. Come on Disney, use the star wars universe to create some fresh material like you did on Rogue One, a opposed to using the vehicle to rehash a very familiar story.",5,7,9,8 April 2018
8 Mile," Won't Fail To Satisfy
","With lousy attempts of the present day pop music idols rushing for the first time directors to put them on the big screen as a leading role, it's quite clear that the   history of singers-turned actors hasn't been a pretty sight. Although once in a blue moon they may just get it right, with a good director and reasonable cast all hope is not lost. 8 mile hit's the screen with rap artist Eminem in his acting debut teaming up alongside `L.A. Confidential' director Curtis Hanson. The story focuses on Jimmy Smith, an angry guy who is dealing with the realities of   life as everything comes tumbling down with him. His only gateway to sanity is his personal communication through rap music, which this film is obviously filled with. What makes this films stand out from so many others is that the music was a simple communication tool between the characters and the audience.The semi-raw cinematography certainly added more drama to the picture without the actual film giving off the impression of it being anything else but a drama piece of cinematic filmmaking. The film itself was quite explicit and certainly took you to the back-streets of Detroit With a shocking yet thoroughly entertaining scenarios of street rapping, gang fights, and the harsh realities we all face from time to time. This is without a doubt one of the most entertaining drama's of the year that will succeed in delivering enjoyment to all, regardless if rap isn't your taste of music. 8 mile is real piece of work to sit down too, with its sharp directing, interesting plot and satisfying performance's from the whole cast including first timer Eminem. This film clearly succeeds where all the other `pop-idols trying to make is as actors' tried so hard to accomplish.",8,0,0,18 January 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Two Thumbs Up!!!
","After 4 years of anticipation for the long awaited follow up to 1999's blockbuster hit, `The Matrix: Reloaded' has finally arrived to resurrect the mind blowing story it's predecessor successfully delivered to us years before. Upon watching such films, one has to attempt to categorize this complete tale that has plagued our minds with perfection for so many countless hours in front of the screen. The matrix has set the ground rules for near perfect science fiction films, and action suspense. Its follow up has more to offer than it's 4-year-old tale of awakening and truth. Reloaded continues the story of the war against artificial intelligence by giving the audience more of what was once seen before. We are witnessing more fights, more intense action and more amazing special effects, with a mighty kick to boost us up beyond comprehension to a whole new other level of filmmaking. The film adds a deeper story to Neo's ability and everyone's purpose in the story of it all. But witnessing such a successful sequel, I couldn't help but notice the endless opportunities the franchise has. The story is deeper, and more sophisticated with endless tones of enjoyment. The story is really moving ahead by really spicing everything we've seen to a whole new product. For people who were satisfied by the effect `The Matrix' gave them back in 1999, and for those yet to experience it, `Reloaded' is the story that was simply waiting to be told in it's purest form 4 years ago. I think it has to be acknowledged that the first part was simply an introduction to the characters with a touch of the real story getting underway. Like the Starwars franchise, these films are better appreciated when one views them as the complete story they are and not the separate chapters sequels label them to be. If you saw `The Matrix' then don't stop at the beginning, push through till the end and then label the story by preference. `Reloaded' is cracking stuff with a cliffhanger to make you go wild, it's still your Hollywood film that boasts as one hell of a good follow up, but it's one of the only films that allows the audience today to choose how much you get involved with the story, and which area you decide to focus on.",9,0,0,23 May 2003
Before Sunrise," Contemporary romance at it's best....
","'Think of this as time travel' Jessie (played by Ethan Hawke) says to Celine (Julie Delpy). After spending moments on a train with a beautiful French student, an inclined cocky young American utters these words in a proposition, which sees two people embark on an impulsive journey around Vienna, where romance slowly flourishes.I've seen Before Sunrise several times now, for the first time a year after its release, and years later when I revisited the film after buying it on DVD. Still years later, the film maintains it's independent glow, and beautifully eloquent dialogue. Jessie and Celine walk the streets of Vienna, visiting cafés, shops, and parks like a pair of tourists on an ignorant quest to discover the real Vienna as well as themselves. The two discuss situations, and exchange thoughts and ideas in an articulate skillful approach that accompanies their yearning to learn more about each other. The film works because the director clearly spent blood and tears painting such complex characters. Their discussions are so private and truthful you have to feel almost ashamed that we cant allow them share their moments on their own, and yet we feel so blessed that we are able to witness these situations. Before Sunrise is above all an honest perception of modern relationships and social interaction. It is a film that carefully expresses its need to believe in love, as it exists today through the eyes of two total strangers who derive from different worlds. This truly is one of director Richard Linklater's most personal films, and it adopts a very European independent style of film-making, which embodies everything that defines Linklater as one of the leading indie masters of our time. It raises questions through its ambiguity and forces the audience to question their own beliefs and approaches to our own unsettling need to find a connection with someone, just like the characters. There are clearly very few films like it, and it successfully raises the bar for which other contemporary drama/romance films will find it difficulty to reach within its depth, intelligence and warmth.",9,1,2,15 April 2007
Identity," A good piece, and so much more!!
","With the all-famous scenario of a group of strangers brought together by a struggle, and the horrors that rise upon them as one by one, they mysteriously end up dead. We the audience, are once again brought into the world of spine chilling fun but this time from director `James Mangold' who previously helmed drama piece `Girl, Interrupted'. Our director is covering new territory this year, with a body of Hitchcock ready to bring us all into this thoroughly enjoyable piece of cinema. `Identity' sees a group of strangers both with there own unique character spirit stranded in a motel on a rainy evening. With no where to go and no one to help them, the group find themselves being stalked by someone or something with the intentions of putting them all to rest before they can even realize who dunnit? The film follows as an almost classic stalker/slasher flick that never fails to deliver the excitement.This is achieved by the clever twist and unpredictable events that bestow as soon as one believes to have figured out the film. The cast more than delivers what is required from a genre that is almost put to rest itself due to lousy attempts to revive it. But then again this film is not one of these attempts; it's a psychological thriller that helms all unpredictability in the body of a worn out story that has been revived relentlessly over the years. John Cusack delivers one of his most daring performances to date, by dabbling in the field and crossing new territory to something you never thought he could pull off. He's bold and always a pleasure to watch.Ray Liotta's portrayal is nothing except what you expect, he's been marked as the aggressive tough guy for his recent roles and it's getting difficult for him to play anything else. Amanda Peet makes a smart move as the character who is almost out dated with predictability, but her cunning attempt to make it all interesting is simply a grinning joy to watch. I enjoyed the directors plot to delve into a genre he seems to know nothing about, and clearly a little ignorance can be a good aspect. I just can't help but think after watching such a treat, if the directing could have been bettered by a crusader who wanted to make a psychological thriller with a slasher genre touch, than a man trying to make a tale of murder with a psychological twist.Nice overall twist's that are guaranteed to make every smart movie watcher's head spin, but simply lacking the vengeance that makes all good psychological thrillers stand back in pride for re-inventing the way all great films are made.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," Great Film, Great Sequel, Great Fun!!!
","By successfully giving more of what the first film so desperately required, Bryan Singer's sequel to X-men is a frightening success. X2 picks up where the first film left off with a stack of new characters to spice things up and a more intriguing story to sit down to. From edge of you seat action scenes, to light yet tragic romance. X2 is the freshest example to date that can erase all past mistakes from it's predecessor, with a clear statement speaking out true potential in film sequels actually fulfilling everything it needs, in allowing follow-ups to be exciting. The real gem to be discovered here, is the in the depth realism every character has the ability to reveal in this movie. We get to see real emotion and truth from most of the leading cast precisely when it is to be expected in order not make the films heart throbbing moments seem too corny or fake. The scenarios give a more comic book feel than the first film did and with the introduction of new characters such as the eye catching `Night Crawler', and `Ice-man', we can hardly wait to see what director Bryan Singer cooks up for the sequel that is screaming to be made. To conclude, X2 is your more than satisfying movie entertainment, that will give a kick to all those who are wanting a piece of the extreme thrills and a grin to all those just wanting some mindless fun.",8,0,0,2 May 2003
Munich," Excellent
","'It's strange to think of one's self as an assassin'. The quote that stirred me in the theatrical trailer of 'Munich', and the dialogue that stuck with me every step of the way today when I sat down to watch Spielberg's latest venture into cinema. Where does one even begin todiscuss a film that has created endless discussion before it's generalrelease? Simply in the same way Spielberg handled the material when he set out to make such a complicated film, 'With careful hands'. In a film that follows a team of Jewish assassins requested, to retaliate against Palestinian terrorists after the events of the Munich Olympics, there is nothing but pure cinematic tension from beginning. However difficult it is to begin watching this film, without your own personal views on the bitter conflict resurfacing from time to time, you can't look away from the dilemma on screen, or reframe from feeling nothing but sympathy for both parties. The violence within the film, although you are perfectly aware is just around the corner, hits you creating a pumping after effect and never fully allows you to recover. Spielberg tops scene after scene with his handling of dramatic materiel, and while the cause for conflict slowly disintegrates as the film progresses, we are left with nothing but remorse for the violence that never seems to end. The acting is spectacular with stand out performances from Eric Bana to Geoffrey Rush. While Spielberg is renown for his ability to bring out the most within his actors, it still to this day dazzles me how well this filmmaker can dabble in the different genres and still bring, living, breathing characters to the screen. While most of us will do our up most to enter the theatre with strong feelings determined to tackle this film, it's hard to walk out not feeling that you got a taste for this films endless pain and awakening perspective. Those determined enough to sit down to it, will be inflicted with the endless discussions that are presented before them. This is important storytelling for our era that will live with you hours and maybe even days after your first viewing. Without doubt Munich is Spielberg's bravest film to date, that requires only one sitting to grasp how upsetting violence and revenge really is, how it's ability to corrupt what appears to be the most noblest of intentions, and how the darkest part of mans soul can easily live with it.",9,0,1,27 January 2006
The Thin Red Line," Poetic, terrifying, tragic and brilliant!!!
","Terrence Malick directs this beautiful poetic masterpiece about the dark terrifying experiences that is war, and the brotherhood of men that help keep themselves alive through nightmarish ordeals that they are forced to go through.  When men talk to us about there experiences on the battlefield and how day after day there main goal in life was to just do there best at what every human being is trained for, and that is to keep living. We try to understand how it felt, how it was like to wake up in the dirt that you slept in the night before, the sentimental bonding you shared with someone for only a brief moment and then the reality of losing them to enemy fire. A lot of people paid their duties to there country, and death was the price. The truth is, we can never fully understand or even make an attempt to close our eyes and vision what some of our grandparents went through, or what others had to live up to.The Thin Red Line is a film that is focused strictly on the idea to get that message through to us.  It follows a number of poetic soldiers as they venture of into the battlefield scared, confused and unaware of the dangers that lie ahead of them. The soldiers are led by one captain, who's love and respect for his men guide him through the thoughts of losing them under the dangers that war is.The film is filled with a large popular cast that has undying talent and it is this talent that is projected a lot during the film. The acting and memorable story telling will capture a lot of the thoughts that will leave you helpless and stunned as soon as the end credits appear.Every film that displays enough emotion and beauty as this film does has a message that can be interpreted in so many ways, that a gathering of friends will surely be able to devote many conversations regarding its tale of courage, friendship, and most of all the privilege of being able to breathe and wake up every morning, no matter how hard life may be.The message I get is one that I hope everyone will one day be able to except because it is one that requires us to except how we live and most of all, realizing that you should live everyday to its full potential. The beauty of life can be seen through a painting, the way you look into someone's eyes or even during a difficult time such as war. Some how with the graphic horrors that is war, and the suffering that every man is forced to deal with, this film successfully tells us that in any nightmare one can succeed in finding peace with them selves. It is a film that reaches the brightest and darkest aspects of the human soul and should be noticed as being one of the most expressive poetic storytelling masterpieces of our time.",9,0,0,18 June 2002
Gangs of New York," Hollywood's best movie of 2002!!!
","After years in the making, this story of history, honor, revenge and violence will one day be labeled a Hollywood classic that everyone must respect enough to sit down to at least once. Martin Scorsese's tale of a life during the days when violence was a way of living in the streets of New York is simply overwhelming to the human eye. By setting the scene beautifully with every perfection in detail we successfully witness the birth of a city and the horrors that took over it during a period of struggling conflicts between the Native Americans and the Irish immigrants. The film follows young Amsterdam Vallon (played successfully by Leonardo Dicaprio) as he re-enters the underground world of New York City to revenge the death of his Father, who once stood up to the violent hatred of the Irish immigrants as the leader of the `Dead Rabbits' gang. The quest for revenge leads him to the hands of the man who runs the underground circuit nicknamed `The Butcher' magnificently played by Daniel Day-Lewis. With a lengthy time run, this film delivers a very complex reality in the world of the politics, crime lords, thieves and the one man who stands in between all of them. This is a cinematic piece with extreme desire to stay true to the historic events that once occurred, and has posh touches of Hollywood glamour that makes is all the more entertaining. What I couldn't stop thinking about was how many different ways the film could have been approached and maybe the only problem with what it is, could be that the director tried to hard to make it everything, when it could have focused more on either the depiction of violence in the old Gang Wars, the political issue's the people trying to run the country had to deal with or either just focusing in the way of life these citizens were unwillingly forced to deal with. Instead the film contained all of the above, successfully and without fail. But I find it hard to believe that everyone who has seen the film didn't want something a little more to suit there own personal satisfaction, be it a tale of violence, a story of revenge and anger, or simply a historical piece of truth. The film has it all and has endless opportunities for the audience's satisfaction, there isn't a soul around who will not find something they love about this overwhelming Hollywood movie.",Null,0,0,14 March 2003
High Fidelity," SERIOUSELY GOOD!!!!
","The most realistic modern portrayal of love I have ever seen, High Fidelity is a truly excellent piece of movie entertainment that can always be viewed just one more time. Watch it for the laughs, the most lovable characters of all and the most amazing soundtrack ever to be packed into 106minutes of romantic comedy cinema. Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a troubled record shop owner whose life takes a wrong turn when his long-term girlfriend leaves him. Forced to deal with his loss Rob lives his life as best as he can accompanied by his musical work buddies Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso). With the feel of rejection building up Rob makes a lousy attempt to forget his girlfriend and quickly build an obsessive need to rehash is past relationships in order to discover weather it was really his fault they all ended badly or just a mysterious turn of fate. With an unbeatable cast and without a doubt Cusack's finest performance to date, director Stephen Frears delivers Nick Hornby's best selling novel to the screen with a taste of the realistic complexity that is the modern relationship, unforgettable performances, comic relief and some pretty sweet tunes.",9,0,1,24 September 2002
