The Ring," Very Well Done
","Much much better than the average movie of this type, with fine acting and an intelligent script. Starts slowly but the punch in the last half makes it well worthwhile. Drawbacks are the inevitable difficulty of child actors although the boy does his best, and the uninvolvement of the police or other authorities in grisly deaths which lends an air of unreality to the proceedings. However the solid pacing and scare rating allows any negative to be overlooked when the time comes for show and tell. Don't watch it alone.",8,1,1,18 October 2003
As Good as It Gets," What?
","If the film wanted to depict real people doing real things it fell far far short. Really a polemic for PC as well as an ad for the AMA, no body in this horrible concoction ever walked a street. Every scene drips with falsity. If you look at it as a kind of fairy tale you might like it.",4,1,5,3 September 2003
The Best Years of Our Lives," Great Movie
","It's a pleasure to live in a world where The Best Years of Our Lives could be created. It contains several of the most memorable moments in film history, first rate performances by virtually the whole cast, one of the great scores in movie history, and a story that perfectly reflects the post war years. The atmosphere is achingly real, of the hope and emptiness and uncertainties, of the difference in generations and experiences, and of the changes in the United States. The Best Years of Our Lives presents the Post War Era and its personages so intimately that you feel something for every one of the characters. This is, obviously, one of my favorites and I recommend it as highly as any movie ever made.",10,3,5,5 May 2003
Cast Away," Worth seeing
","A good, not great movie. Extremely well acted by Hanks. Action scenes very good. Inventive. Held my attention throughout. Not for children or those who like constant action. Disappointing last 1/2 hour and the very end was so off the wall it would have been better omitted. But definitely worth seeing.",8,0,0,26 December 2000
Love Actually," Female Romance Fantasy
","It would be too much to ask for geniune emotion and relationships in a Hollywood movie. However Love, Actually goes well over the line toward utter fantasy. You won't be as disappointed if you don't expect much of anything real, since those moments are delivered only when Emma Thompson is on the screen-she's incapable of falsity. It's too bad so much talent is wasted on tripe like this, though.",2,1,2,28 November 2003
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Fangs a lot!
","Top notch production that is sabotaged only by weaknesses in the original story and by Reeves, who is a generally woeful actor in any movie not named 'The Matrix'. Oldham does fine in scenes opposing him but Ryder, who is supposed to be a weaker character, seems unreal because who could be more of a schlump than Keanu? It is a travesty that he played this part and I assume it was a studio requirement to get the movie made. Otherwise, the pace, cinematography and acting are first rate. As I said the story is not first rate, owing to the predictability of (nearly) any horror finale. Still, the ending is accomplished better than most of the genre. Sadie Frost gives a fabulous performance that, along with Oldham and Hopkins, holds the film together. Well worth seeing if only as a fine example of movie craftsmanship, but there is plenty of eye candy of all kinds, too.",8,1,3,7 January 2008
The Sixth Sense," Not just a thriller
","The Sixth Sense is about love, relationships, eternity and faith as much as it is a thriller. It is a very accomplished scare film but if it were just that it could join the hopper of similar forgettable movies made and forgotten every year. 'Sense' rises far above the genre, creating people we care about in situations we understand and with a philosophical approach that says much about the way people live. I think it is one of the finest films of the decade and will survive a long time.",10,0,0,31 May 2003
The Wizard of Oz," Over the Rainbow
","Who wouldn't want to visit a world composed of everything and everyone beautiful or mysterious, where you are the centerpoint of all action, princess, heroine, friend? Oz is such a world and the incomparable Judy Garland is the fortunate visitor, with majestic results. Certainly one of the finest films ever made, 'Wizard' is a happy accident resulting from perfect casting and the studio system that faithfully churned out it's product through superior organization despite upper echelon headaches. Garland could not have been improved on, the sets, music and pacing are perfection. Judy sums up the hopes of all mankind in her unmatched rendition of 'Over the Rainbow', IMO the finest song in film. If you haven't seen it, I envy you. Enjoy!",10,1,2,9 September 2003
