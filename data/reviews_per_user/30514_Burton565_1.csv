Minority Report," If You Dig Up the Past...
","This film marks a triumphant return of the Fritz Langian (Dir. of Metropolis)/ Kubrickian style of film making, one that questions government and personal freedom. What Spielberg did here was part of his 'Running Man Series' (A.I, Catch Me if You Can, Minority Report), where he presented a multi-layered character, John Anderton, running from the law after being framed for a murder he did not commit. Yet. I stress 'Yet' because of the Pre-Crime System that is the leading tool in crime in the year 2054, which leads the police to chase after John. The film follows the wrongfully accused John as he evades both the law and his past and tries to seek justice in the end. This film is truly a smart and cunning look at society today and where we are heading. For those of you who are fans of the original 100+ page short story by sci-fi guru Philip K. Dick, you will notice that the subject matter has taken a morose yet poignant turn, giving John more of a past and a purpose. Minority Report is so good that it knows you will like it even before you do!",10,2,4,24 June 2005
