Black Swan," Overrated Noisy Mess
","At first I didn't get it. Then it dawned on me that this is an attempt at making psychological thriller. The psycho part is good, with Portman's acting. The story is very predictable, almost cliche.
Sexy? Well, to some it may be. For me it was all ugly lingerie worn by uglier chicks.
And noise, too much noise in the name of music.
Bit still the movie is a bit interesting, slightly above average.",6,0,1,27 December 2018
Casablanca," Highly Overrated Noisy Movie
","I believe this movie has been given a high rating because it is OLD! Otherwise, there is nothing much interesting in it. Acting is mediocre, music is just noise. Story/plot can be easily guessed. Only direction compensates a bit, for which I give this five stars. Not recommended. If it had been produced in today's movie world, it would have been in danger of being a B movie.",5,2,6,22 October 2017
Gone Baby Gone," I am so glad I saved my one and half hour!
","I have been watching Hollywood movies for a while now. I have developed this interesting sense that tells me whether a movie is watchable or not, right after the first 10 or 15 minutes. When I started to watch this movie, I immediately knew this was going to be a big bore. However, I kept hope that it may turn interesting (knowing that Morgan Freeman was there). After 23 minutes of watching, my patience ran out. So I simply fast forwarded it. Gladly, I found that the movie is bull$h!t. But I was still intrigued. I might have missed a great movie. So I went to wikipedia, searched it and read the plot. Sigh of relief came as the plot also turned out the same crap I expected. So my dear reader! DON'T watch it if you have the slightest regard for your time. It is so boring it should be renamed to '$h!t Baby $h!t'.",3,4,8,3 November 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Why the high rating?
","This movie is okay, but not something you would give an 8/10 rating. Probably it was the US audience who were more impressed with it. Average story, average acting.",5,0,11,7 June 2019
JFK," A Movie with Obvious Story and No Surprises
","I tried to watch this movie twice. The first time I got fed up after one hour. The second time I started the movie where I had left it the first time. I could watch for only about ten minutes. Then I fast forwarded it and watched the last few minutes. I didn't need to watch the whole movie as the end was exactly as I had imagined. Acting and direction etc were good, no doubt, but the story could have been told in less than 90 minutes instead of 180. All in all, a disappointing movie. No entertainment. I am glad I didn't waste much of my time watching each and every detail. Somethings you already know, and there is no use repeating the obvious, however dramatic it may be.",3,2,8,6 October 2014
Prisoners," Death by Boredom: Prisoners
","Yes, that should be the proper name; Death by Boredom: Prisoners. If I say I am fuming, smoldering, and boiling with rage after wasting my precious two and a half hours by watching this... this... 'movie', I would be lying, because i am not in rage any more. I am already dead with boredom. For the first time I have found out that having above 8 ratings on IMDb does not necessarily mean the movie is good. I ask all the raters who rated is this high, are you serious guys? Do you really think it is a movie? Did you really like it? Or did somebody pay you to rate it this high? If so please tell me who, not because I want to be paid; it's because I want to sue that person for hoodwink. IMDb!! You are losing your authenticity for interesting movies. Mark my words.",1,9,27,9 December 2013
Saints and Soldiers," Low Budget Cliche Ridden Nonsense
","They tried to make another Saving Private Ryan. . . and failed miserably. It would have made a better movie if they had shot the director too at the end. What was the plot? Why were the characters acting so strange? Nothing made sense, including the high rating. Plus point, you only have to suffer it for just 90 minutes. Be thankful because the director could have stretched this ten minute story to three hours.",3,0,0,12 July 2019
Black Panther," Overrated, cliched movie that kills expectations
","I am quite surprised how this movie did so much business? There is nothing new in the story. The writers have managed to put in a plot twist, but it's so poor it does not even surprise. It's like you already know it. Action sequences are a bit good, but too short. Acting is horrible. At best, this movie can be called average.",4,0,1,5 May 2018
Shark Tale," Cringe-worthy and Over-emphasized
",I am sure this movie is a big embarrassment for both Smith and DeNiro.,4,0,0,31 January 2019
