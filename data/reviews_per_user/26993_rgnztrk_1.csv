Conquest 1453," Not bad scenes but not objective too
",While I was watching the movie one of the worst thinks were no Turkish soldiers didn't die. That just made me laugh. Lots of people talked about fanaticism and propaganda and ... That is so normal for Turkish movies. It's so weird but directors always make enemies as bad people. And Turks were born to rescue. I think Turkish historical-comedy movies are more objective than the others. And this is something funny that there are usually a superhero can even kill more than 2 people with just an arrow :P . But in this movie at least they really fought to kill. Don't make so much pessimistic comments. Turkish cinema is going better step by step. In this step at least they made nice battle scenes. Don't think like UlubatlÄ± Hasan is a fantasy character.Lots of people tells that he was exist and it's true that he died with lots of arrows while he was at the tower with flag.,3,1,3,3 March 2013
