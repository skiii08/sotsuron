Black Swan," Have I watched the wrong movie???@>?~?
","I couldn't wait to see Black Swan, given all the rave reviews.....and I could hardly sit through it when I finally did.... Seriously, what film has everyone been watching? How can anyone consider this film a masterpiece and how can it end up with a score of 8+ on IMDb? This film is about as subtle as a sledge hammer, it's trying very hard to be deep and psychological, but it's basically just pretentious. Dramatic music at every corner is setting the tone and Ms Portmans pain stricken face in constant close ups....just in case the audience doesn't get it, yes indeed, this is supposed to be a very disturbing film. I wish it was! Then at least I would have felt anything at all. Instead, the way the story was told the characters left me completely cold. Don't get me wrong, I love great movies, an intelligent script and more than anything I appreciate a film that gets under my skin and touches me emotionally. This film so doesn't. Actually it left me so indifferent, I can't even be bothered to put much effort into this review.",1,170,326,22 January 2011
