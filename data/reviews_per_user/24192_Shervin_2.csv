The Blair Witch Project," Scared of Nothing...
","I just watched THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT...I don't know what to say about this different different movie except one simple sentence...It's a new kind of scary movies. You are scared to death, But you DO NOT know exactly why. It's scaring of the unknowns and unseens. We're just terrified of this odd process going on which adds to our ignorance more and more as time passes. The atmosphere is SCARY AS HELL. But, After all directors are keeping us TUNED FOR MORE MEDIA INFORMATION in this hell. I don't know what to call this. We are scared of nothing. It's a new way...I believe in its revolutionary way...",Null,0,1,27 November 2000
The Matrix," Could be better...
","Good Characters, Good Music, Extraordinary Effects...With a plot far more better than this Cliche (May be with a little more philosophic attitude towards world, human beings, existence and the MATRIX rather than raw action) would be the best SCI-Fi movie of 90's. After all I can't stop admiring Audio/Visual effects...Highly Recommended for a Sci-Fi lover with a taste of high tempo and happy end.",Null,0,0,21 May 2000
