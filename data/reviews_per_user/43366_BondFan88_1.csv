Resident Evil: Afterlife," This one's for the game fans
","I've seen this movie twice already and going to see it a third time. I've enjoyed the series thus far but this one just takes the cake, and it's much better than Extinction. At the beginning of the movie, Alice loses her powers in a fight with Wesker. For good. So now she's as normal as all of the other characters. Claire returns for this movie, as well as Chris and someone else, which I won't spoil. Just stay for the credits is all I'm going to say. She survives and finds Claire, and the both of them fly to Los Angeles to look for more survivors. They do find some, who are holed up in a maximum security prison and want to get to a nearby safe haven. Alice joins up with them and they plan their escape, which will be tough given the number of zombies and monsters surrounding the prison.The 3D effects are simply amazing and the action is great as well. Just because Alice is normal doesn't mean she can't kick some serious butt, and the video game characters do just as well, and in most cases better than she does. Again, the video game characters get tons more representation in this film then they have in the past. It's definitely worth seeing and I can't wait to take it home once it's released in stores.Another thing worth noting is the excellent soundtrack, which is available on iTunes. I haven't enjoyed an RE movie soundtrack this much since the first movie. They really did an excellent job with this movie overall and I hope to see a part 5!",10,13,28,15 September 2010
