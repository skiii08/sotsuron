The Blair Witch Project," Good movie, few tops.
","I've been a horror/thriller-fan for years, and was really looking forward to this one. The documentary-like appearance and really good acting makes this flick a chilling experience. The atmosphere is unique and original, but there's really no surprises. People hear sounds, they run and scream, but nothing is HAPPENING! And when climax is near, the film is over, just like that. A bit disappointing, but after all, it's worth seeing.",6,0,1,5 April 2001
