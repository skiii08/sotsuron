50 First Dates," For a comedy, I sure cried allot!
","I don't know if it was the tone of the movie or the wonderful story or Drews smile or just the mood I was in. But I cried allot during this film.I'm ashamed to say so, but it's true. The comedy around the main story is just to give this harsh story a more lighthearted spirit. But the story in itself is really sad. Drew losing her memory everyday and seeing people who care for her very much trying to  help her deal with it and seeing how they deal with it is just heartwrecking.This is not an movie that will get an Oscar nomination, but it's just a cute little film with a lovely heartwarming story. You could rent it for you and your sweetheart while just sitting next to each other with a bag of popcorn. Enjoy!",7,0,0,15 June 2004
Honey," If you're looking for some inspirational light entertainment..
","This is a beautiful little movie that just fun to watch. Okay it's full of clich√©s, predictable in some places, the dialogs are funky sometimes.But who cares?If you have nothing to do on a saturday night and your boyfriend/girlfriend just dumped you this movie will get you right up! You've got good vibes coming from all over this movie.The dancing scenes are really tight, the casting has been done beautifully especially casting Jessica Alba. God she likes shines of the screen.Go and see this movie, it's fun...Oh but there is one thing that I kept noticing. And that was that the movie resembles 'Glitter' in so many ways. I see that the scriptwriter Kate Lanier worked on both projects.",7,10,17,15 April 2004
