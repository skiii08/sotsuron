The King's Speech," Ten Plus!
","I cannot believe it took me this long to watch this movie! I'd always heard of it but was never interested. Boy am I glad I came across it on Netflix. This is easily one of my favorite movies. I started stuttering as a child, not nearly as bad as Firth's character but I could totally relate. The opening scene where Firth gave that speech had me cringing. The way he tried so hard to get those words out and the way his face turned red from all the straining, I felt like I wanted to disappear and I was not the one giving the speech. Firth played the role superbly and embodied his character wholly. I cannot think of any other actor who could have performed the way he did.I have always respected and admired Rush's work. He is a true talent and brought his A game to this film. The pairing of Firth and Rush was smart and complimentary. I really thought Rush's talent would outshine Firth but it was actually the other way around. What a great endearing movie that many can relate to.",10,2,3,14 March 2014
Changeling," Horrible casting ruined this film
","The casting of Joilee and Malkovich ruined what could have been a good film. Joilee was totally, utterly unconvincing as the doting mother and when her son disappeared, though she could command tears at will, she came off aloof and indifferent. Also there was nothing demure about her trademark full lips painted red throughout the entire movie. Those lips would have been downright obscene in 1928. So Joliee spends the entire film mousing around trying to convince the police that the imposter boy was not her son. They tell her she's crazy and toss her in the loony bin. During this entire time Joilees character is acting like a damsel in distress. Then towards the end of the movie she visits the guy who is accused of killing her son, and commences to kicking his butt in prison like she is Evelyn Salt! Um I know Clint Eastwood is pushing 100 but did his Alzheimers kick in or something? Malkovich only knows one thing and that's how to play himself. One a director casts him they should know they will be getting a very one dimensional actor. Well can't really call it acting if you're playing yourself. There are so many better qualified actors that could have played Mrs. Collins.",4,4,7,4 September 2014
The New World," My favorite film
","I have watched this movie well over a dozen times since I saw it in the theater in 2005. I was mesmerized then and am still mesmerized every time I watch it. This movie is simply art. Watching it is like watching a painting, a beautiful painting.Terrance Malick directed this film brilliantly. I still find it hard to believe that he was able to film in such a pristine and perfect location to film. There is not much dialogue in the movie but it doesn't need any. You can clearly tell what the movie is about without having to listen to a script.What can I say? I just love this movie. The beauty and purity of it always brings me to tears. I am always deeply moved when I watch this. Such a visceral film",10,0,2,7 July 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Brilliant!
",Wow! This is the first movie I have seen with Lerman and I am stunned at his acting ability. How can he be so talented at such a young age? I actually felt for the character. I actually felt awkward and cringed whenever he was on screen and was being pushed around. I can't say I can relate because I was never that kid in high school but now that I'm an adult I can appreciate the bullying that he suffered. We are meant to suspect that Charlie has severe issues but no one could fathom the depth of his problems until the end of the movie.I just can't get over how talented Lerman is. He drew me in and kept me hooked from the beginning to end. At first I thought Charlie was a bit of a creep but as the movie drew on I realized he was just a typical teenager who had been through way too much at his tender age and was handling it all pretty well. This is a brilliant movie with a brilliant cast and a brilliant message. A must see for everyone.,10,0,1,4 September 2014
Iron Man 3," Epic alright. Epic Flop!
","I don't understand. Iron Man 1 and 2 were awesome. Why couldn't they use the director of those to direct this finale? What happened? Iron Man 3 was horrible. It's true that Stark is witty but to turn him into a clown? Also the meat and potatoes of the movie is supposed to be about the suit, so why was Stark out of the suit for pretty much the entire movie? In the beginning of the movie the Mandarin destroyed Stark's home and blew up all the suits, so why did 13 suits fly out of the lower level of the house in the end to aid Stark. This movie really angered me. Did the director not watch Iron Man 1&2 and Avengers? I just wanted to scream! How can Robert Downey all this travesty to happen? What a waste.",1,9,20,7 May 2013
Friday Night Lights," Perfect 10
","This is the best football movie I've ever seen. Well I take that back, this is the best sports movie I've ever seen. Funny I never heard about it until recently. But when I realized that Billy Bob Thornton and Lucas Black would be sharing the screen again I definitely had to tune in. So there's this small town with nothing going on and football is their only salvation so they take it seriously. They down right obsess over it. All the adults live vicariously through the high school football players and the players do their best to deal with the immense pressure and stress placed on them to win championships.Thornton did an amazing job but Lucas Black was the star of the show. His performance was powerful and impressive. He displayed so much intensity and conviction that I was with him every step of the way. As a matter of fact all of the main characters did an amazing job. I really liked that this was not a typical football movie about an underdog team that gets their stuff together just in time to win the championship. Just made the move all the more realistic. This movie really is a gem. The director did a fantastic job.",10,0,0,23 April 2014
Gravity," Art!
","Alfonso Cuarón has a way of hooking into the viewer emotionally and he did so again with this film. The movie was gripping, suspenseful and expressive. I felt as if I was right there with Bullock, going through everything that she was going through. The scenery throughout the film was so stunning and overwhelming that I almost felt unworthy of watching it. I'm not an astronaut or scientist so I can't comment on how accurate the depiction of space was but I sure did appreciate the visuals.I was hooked, I was scared, I cried, I laughed and I questioned what I could do to make my life better. This is the effect watching this film had on me. Alfonso Cuarón doesn't just direct movies. He creates art, like a painting. And any good painting incites emotion. So that's what watching his films does to me. This movie was definitely a 10 from start to finish.",10,23,43,8 October 2013
42," Snooze fest
",Snooze fest. Yawn. This movie fails miserably to draw emotion out of the audience. All the scenes that should have tugged at the heart stings fell flat. Harrison Ford's character is more like Mickey in Rocky and the nobody who played Jackie Robinson clearly took no acting lessons.Also this movie focused too heavily on the game of baseball instead of developing Robinson's character. The movie ended and I still know zero about Robinson.I guess people feel compelled to like this movie because of who it is based on.What a waste.,2,9,21,8 July 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A little cliché
","Chris Evans is crazy hot. I mean the guy is physically perfect, so I will gladly pay to watch him in any movie. I wasn't crazy about the first Captain America flick but the previews for this one looked promising so I went to the theater with high expectations and super excited to be staring at Evans on the big screen. I mean I would pay to watch the guy eat a burger. The movie though, fell a little flat. The action scenes were OK but a little gratuitous. The winter soldier was bad ass, but when they revealed his identity, the cheese factor of movie went from zero to 100 and I was turned off. Couldn't the writers come up with anything more original? I thought the fact that Rogers cute neighbor was also a shield agent was cliché. Also Scar Jo looked like a Jersey Shore guido with her fake tan and 4 shades of bronzer and circa 2000 frosted pink lipstick. Anthony Mackie's character the Falcon added absolutely nothing to the movie. Was he supposed to be some kind of token or something? He pretty much came across like Capt. America's door mat. And for the love of me I don't understand why they made Capt. America use the same costume from the first movie; the costume from 1944. What happened to the Avengers version of his costume? Even though the director of this movie did not want to use it, why didn't they come up with a 2014 version? So the winter soldier has a cool modern cutting edge costume and the star of the feature has a dusty, baggy museum ensemble from 1944? Evans has this amazing anatomically perfect body and they hide it behind this unremarkable getup?",6,0,2,7 April 2014
Lost in Translation," All the cultural/racial jokes cheapened the film
","When I first watched this movie over a decade ago, I really enjoyed it. I guess because I was so young I took everything with a grain of salt.I tried watching it again a few days ago and was so turned off by all the juvenile racist jokes made by Murray's character. I couldn't stop cringing. Bob Harris is supposed to be an actor with decades of experience. Makes me think he should be well traveled and have an appreciation for other cultures and cuisine. Why then, portray his character like some hillbilly who has never traveled out of his neck of the woods?Johansson's character seemed like a spoiled brat who indulged and encouraged Murray's character when ever he cracked all the tasteless insensitive jokes using a fake Japanese accent. It was down right offensive.The Japanese characters throughout the movie were wonderful and gentle people who welcome these foreigners with open arms. Was Coppola's goal to portray the characters as stereotypical rude Americans? If so, she succeeded.",3,0,6,27 April 2020
Interstellar," Total nonsense
","When I saw this was directed by Chris Nolan I said there's no way I can miss this movie. Then I checked out the ratings on IMDb and went running to the theater only to be put to sleep. This movie was supposed to take place a few centuries into the future, however when cooper goes to his daughter's school for the parent teacher conference there is a tube TV in the classroom. Huh? Tube tvs can't be found anywhere in 2014 yet we're expected to believe they exist 200 years in the future.Also what was the point of cooper and the kids following that drone? They made a huge climatic event and then the drone crashes and that's it. OK so what's the point. Going through the worm hole was OK but the other planets that were visited looked down right fantastical. Like out of a Disney fairytale. This film was filled with A listers but fell flat. Matt Damon's character was totally predictable and so was the ending. I really don't understand the appeal and high ratings.",1,13,25,20 December 2014
American Hustle," Was OK, could have been better
","For me this started off slow, got really good and fizzled in the end. I really have to bash the end because it really ruined the movie for me. How could Bale and Adam's character walk away scott free or rather scratch free after pulling off a con that got so many people in trouble? How could they walk away after trying to con De Niro's character who is supposedly the most nefarious mob enforcer in the country? So what he didn't get taken down, he would have still wanted retribution for the attempt. I mean come on seriously? The film was based on actual events so I think in the 70's the con people would probably end up in a dumpster somewhere. Also if an FBI agent misplaced 2 million dollars of his agency's money because he got conned, he would have no doubt been fired. How can the audience be expected to take a movie seriously when the director himself does not?",5,2,3,31 March 2014
Man of Steel," Meh....Action sequence was too Michael Bay-ish
","This could have been a great movie. Picture if Terrance Malick and Christopher Nolan directed a movie, this would be it. The only disappointment was the fight scenes. They reminded me too much of Michael Bay's transformers. They were confusing and unrealastic. Also all the blatant brand placement cheapened the movie and took away from its richness. The brand placement went overboard. I don't think I have ever seen so many brands displayed in a single movie in such a shameless manner before. They made sure that every brand shot got a good 5 seconds of air time. If someone checked their phone the NOKIA logo took up half of the screen etc. Seriously? I felt embarrassed for the main actors who signed up for this movie/2.5hr commercial. Well I guess they needed some way to pay for all the cgi they used in the excessive, mindless fight scenes.The guy who played Super Man was perfect for this role. Great looking Guy, strong dark and silent. The guy who played the villain was too cartoonish. I couldn't really take him seriously.All the flash back scenes of when Kent was a boy were pure magic. Like art. Very touching stuff. But I definitely think they got carried away with the cgi and action.",7,0,2,15 June 2013
Ender's Game," A little boring.
","I was a little bored. The graphics were awesome along with the costumes and all the sets etc. but I still found the movie a little boring. I guess they spent too much time on nothing-ness. I have never read the book so I was not sure what to expect but I was expecting a little more action and excitement.The movie was almost 2 hours long, but the first hour and 45 minutes was of all the kids in the classroom training and trying to figure out who they are and their purpose on the ship. I guess considering they are children one can't really expect much in the way of action but still I felt there was something missing.The last 5 minutes of the movie was the best part. The twist in the end made a lot of sense. It sort of brought all the loose ends throughout the movie together. But if it really wasn't a game they could have shown some footage of the crew on the ship that was destroyed etc. and the bugs being cremated on the planet.",5,1,6,1 November 2013
The Lego Movie," Very cheesy
","I don't understand the high ratings this film is getting. Sure I loved Legos as a kid but the movie was horrible. It was jumpy and erratic and didn't make any sense. Sure it had a good message; that you should always be yourself and not fit the societal mold, but besides that it was pretty much unbearable. I didn't laugh not once though out the entire film and my kids didn't know any better. As if that wasn't bad enough, they had to mix the Lego block figurines with humans and Will Farrel made an appearance. I usually really enjoy the kiddie movies when I take my kids but this I must say is the worst I have experienced thus far. I gave it one star and another for the positive message.",2,10,25,15 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Typical Super Hero Flick
","OK so honestly I went to the theater not expecting much and got what I paid for. All the super hero movies are starting to look the same. There's no more wow factor or element of mystery, just the same old story. The best part of the movie was quick silver and he was only featured for about 5 minutes. The movie was so inconstant that it couldn't even be held together with crazy glue. How can Professor X be there to send wolverine into the past if he was killed by the phoenix 4 x-men movies ago? Did they think we would forget that tid-bit?Wolverine gets sent back to 1972 in an effort to help fix things and save Mystique, which is wonderful. Where I felt like I was slapped in the face was when a drop of her blood was recovered and Trask was able to extract her DNA for testing. Huh? Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought DNA did not exist in 1972. Also if a sentinel kills Magneto in the future shouldn't he have ceased to exist in the past?Then you had the typical mass destruction that only mutants or super heroes can cause. At this point it's become so expected and dull that even Magneto putting a baseball stadium around the white house was not worthy of a second glance. All the CGI and epic battle scenes have become cliché. And all the super hero flicks are beginning to look the same.",5,4,8,28 May 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Best in franchise!
",My gosh! I laughed. I cried. I was at the edge of my seat. I was glued to my seat not knowing what to expect. I felt a wave of nostalgia ebb and flow. I cried some more.This movie was comprehensive and covered all its bases as far as closing the chapter on all the avengers movies. I also appreciated the balance between the human side of the heroes (showing how loosing everyone effected them) and the fight scenes.The final battle for the infinity stones left me in tears. I thought it was beautiful that captain America was able to wield thor's hammer. And when all the heroes started to materialize out of nowhere I thought I would scream with excitement!I have been a fan of the avengers since day one and heavily invested emotionally in every movie. I'm sad to see it end especially for iron man and captain America (my favorite avenger). I guess now I will wait to see what else marvel has in store for us.,10,39,61,16 August 2019
Non-Stop," Just Plain Awful
","What a disaster. What a boring disaster. Finding a spider in my bed would have been more exciting than suffering through this sophomoric and predictable flick. I love Liam Neeson and I respect him as an actor. For whatever reason, he has chosen to stick to fast paced action movies instead of dramas and that's fine by me, but this mess of a movie left me speechless with all its inconsistencies and plot holes.-Julianne Moore goes out of her way to comfort Neeson during take-off because he's nervous but when he asks her what she does for a living she says she flies a lot and has to get some rest.-When Neeson confronts the other air marshal in the lavatory he tells Neeson 'We can split the money' but never gets a chance to explain before Neeson kills him.-In the beginning of the flight Neeson duct tapes the hands of the guy who asks him for a 'light' at the airport and the guy is able to slip a phone into another passengers pocket, yet Neeson kept receiving text messages throughout the flight, while said phone was supposedly in the pocket of an unsuspecting passenger? -Neeson becomes suspicious of Julienne Moore and asks her again what she does and she goes into this long story about how she had heart surgery and likes the window seat,but never answers the question.-There's a passenger on the plane who can send a signal to the phone that's been sending all the messages to help Neeson locate it, but when Neeson gets the phone he does not use this tech savvy passenger to help him hack the password, instead him and Moore play with phone and eventually set off the timer for a bomb concealed in the other air marshal briefcase.I can go on and on with all the ridiculous and inconsistent plots but why bother. This movie has already made its fair share of money and that's all the studios are concerned with.",1,60,114,7 March 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Nonsensical action flick
","This movie was filled with nothing but impossible stunts and action sequences. But I guess they had to add a ton of car chases and explosions to distract viewers from the lack of chemistry between the wrongly cast actors. Tom cruise is getting too old to play these roles. Climbing cliffs and scaling buildings with no safety equipment? And we're supposed to buy that bull?Paula Patton has zero charisma and is not a skilled actor. Rennes on the other hand is a skilled actor but somehow did not fit in. The casting was just off, even bizarre. We all know that the sand storms featured in the film were grossly exaggerated like everything else. The only thing missing from this movie was a good script.",3,2,6,19 July 2014
Foxcatcher," Gripping. Intense.
","Wow! This movie was a perfect 10. Who knew Tatum and Carell had it in them? Everyone gave an Oscar worthy performance but I must say Tatum surprised me. I don't know where he pulled his performance out of. Playing the role of the awkward and reclusive one time gold medal Olympic winner was a cinch for him. He totally immersed himself into character. I was super impressed and gained so much respect for him.And Mr. Carell. Seriously? Why did you conceal your talent for so long? He totally nailed the part of the wealthy, creepy, lonely man with mommy issues. I actually fund my self cringing during the scene when he tried to impress his mom by pretending to be the coach and when the guy was paid to lose to him in the wrestling match.Bravo all around. Great performances. Perfect cast. Excellent direction. Superb film.",10,3,4,20 March 2015
Drive," Beautiful
",When I first watched this movie in 2011 I rated it 1 star. I thought it was slow and boring. I felt as if Gosling was asleep throughout the entire film and the director must have been heavily sedated. Imagine my shock when I saw all the rave reviews on IMDb. I was watching TV last night and came across this movie on the ESPN channel so decided to give it another chance. May be I was tired when I first watched it or didn't have an opened mind. Plus it's been 3 years and I've changed so why not.Boy am I glad I decided to watch this masterpiece again. It drew you in with the car chase and kept you hooked with the beautiful and hunting scenes and music. Gosling was perfect as the reserved and mysterious neighbor. He barely said much but didn't have to. I liked that the movie left you with questions. It was sort of unfinished but finished. Definitely one of my favorite films.,10,0,2,31 March 2014
Schindler's List," There is not a rating high enough........
","I cried throughout this entire film the first time I watched it. It was so moving and powerful. The ash from burning bodies raining down from the sky, and the little children hiding in the cesspit, and the men and women running around naked during the medial inspection in the courtyard. I just sat there and cried. And after the movie was finished I ran out and bought it on DVD but have not been able to watch it again. I just can't bring myself to watch it. I have had it for 6 years now still in the wrapper.This is how much the movie moved me. I am still in my 20's and like many have only read about the holocaust and it's hard to imagine what the Jews might have gone through, well this movie will paint a very clear picture for anyone who watches it. Spielberg is a genius on so many levels and he has been for some time now. I hope he continues to educate us with his many works of art.",10,17,27,12 September 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Super hero? More like Soap Opera.
",Oh gosh I don't even know where to begin. I thought the previous spider man was boring but I figured I'd watch this one because of the awesome previews and Jamie Foxx and Paul Giamatti. Well I can honestly say that by half an hour into the movie I was looking at the exit sign in the theater and longing to walk towards it. The movie opened with a bang but the bang had no spark. It was lack luster and predictable and Spider man's whimsical and snappy comments came off as cheap Chinese kung fu voice overs. The movie dragged along at a painfully slow pace with what seemed like no plot or direction. I think I dozed off twice. I honestly felt like I was watching a soap opera.Foxx's character was pretty cool as electro thanks to CGI but he wasn't really formidable. He sort of retained his geeky loser qualities as electro. Giamatti's character as the rhino was awesome and formidable but a dimwit. He came off like some kind of Russian rodeo circus clown. I know the end of this almost 3 hour long melodrama was trying to prepare us for a part three but I will for sure listen to my gut this time and skip it. Like I should have done this one. 4 stars solely for the cool CGI.,4,4,10,20 May 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Boredom
","I really loved the first Avengers. So much that I watched twice in the theaters. It was exciting and fully of suspense and funny and innovative. Nothing had been done like it before. The action was great and Sam Jackson added an element of bas-ass-ness to the entire thing. Boy was I looking forward to part 2. The fact it was being directed by the same person was a plus plus! So we get to the theatre, sit down full of anticipation, bursting at the seams with excitement just to experience a snooze fest.The movie begins with the Avengers fighting villains in a wintery forest. Thor using his hammer and iron man using his suit and captain America using his shield etc. nothing new here peoplekeep it moving. Then the red head is able to sooth the hulk and turn him into Bruce banner by whispering some words to him. Wait a sec I thought the hulk was inconsolable.The Scarlett witch and quicksilver added absolutely nothing to the movie. The Olsen girl has no personality and is wooden on screen and the only thing the Johnson guy has going for him is his body which was covered up by his horrible costume.So they tried to introduce something new to the movie by creating a love thing between black widow and hulk and all of a sudden hawk eye has a wife and kids? Sorry but I'm not buying it. BORING! By this point the action seemed pointless and boring. Nothing new here so keep it moving. No even the addition of that new character could have pulled me into this drivel.I won't even comment on the Ultron character. Strutting around like drunk poet. Absolutely no more super hero movies for me.",2,41,96,8 May 2015
Elysium," WOW!!! Cool and Tasteful!
","This movie gets 10 stars from me because it was the total package! I don't even know where to start. Jodi Foster was born to play that role. She did it so convincingly and perfectly that though she played the bad guy I was rooting for her. Kudos to Matt Damon. I respect more as an actor more and more with every movie choice he makes.The movie was awesome. I don't like futuristic scientific movies because they tend to be on the silly side with the costumes and décor, but Elysium did not have that problem. It was futuristic but tasteful. The fight scenes were a bit shaky but also tasteful.This movie was filled with suspense and humor and emotion. The guy who played agent Kruger was superb. This guy definitely has talent and range(I was a fan of him in District 9). The director of this movie has found a fan for life. I will follow him like a cult and run to watch all of his films. Can't wait till he releases another.",10,7,15,12 August 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Really? A CGI baby? Creepy.
","OK the creepy, obviously fake CGI baby really freaked me out. What on earth was that about? What in the world did I just witness? The acting, or lack there of, all the wooden characters......Stewart and her one expression face. Oh gosh where do I begin? The movie was boring and made no sense. The plot was comical and the scenes had absolutely no connection.I wanted to turn this off after the first 15 minutes for the simple fact that it was so boring and the acting was non existent. Oh yeah and what was the explanation for wolf boy hanging around the vampires home 24/7? Terrible movie to an over priced and over grossing series.",1,7,15,31 July 2013
Pulp Fiction," So Cool.
","I watched this movie once in my early 20's and totally didn't get it. I watched it again in my 30's and was blown away! This movie is freakin awesome. Quentin Tarantino found a way to wrap the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's into this film seamlessly and beautifully. Just an awesome movie with a great script and unexpected humor throughout. The movie is cool and it makes you want to be cool too. One thing I have noticed about Tarantino is that his movies are very cool. They make you feel like you're back in the 70's when it was OK to smoke cool. They make you feel like wearing sunglasses in doors cool.The cast was awesome. Every cast member played their role beautifully. Samuel Jackson was awesome! It was so hilarious how he ate that guy's cheese burger then drank his entire drink in the beginning of the movie before shooting him. That scene was just epic. Every scene was epic.",10,5,11,30 October 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Everything but the ending.
","Wow! A spectacular film with an awesome cast. I'm not a huge fan of Cruise but when I realized this director also directed the Bourne series, I figured this could be equally good. I could totally see the military wearing some kind of exoskeleton armor in the future to fight battles. Though if every soldier had one that could create a ton of electronic waste. The first battle scene where they landed on the beach was crazy scary. I felt like I was right there with Cruise. Filled with terror at having to fight these creatures with an armored suit that I have no idea how it works. Blunt was so bad ass as the full metal bitch. She looked and played the part completely and I was invested in the film 100 percent and was even about to shed a tear close to the end of the movie, but then it didn't end there. Oh no the director had to take a perfectly good ending and turn it into your typical Hollywood fairy tale.So the second ending left me a little dumbfounded. So Cruise killed an alpha male and got covered in its plasma which caused him to have some kind of link with the Omega. The Omega caused Cruise to repeat each day in order to stay one step ahead. OK so in the end Cruise sustains a fatal injury but manages to discharge several grenades which kill both the alpha male and the Omega. So if the alpha male and the Omega cease to exist how in the world was Cruise able to repeat the day? If the omega is the sole reason his days are being repeated and the omega is dead then how can his day repeat? Did the director forget that small detail or was he too busy sucking up to Hollywood execs? That small detail took the movie from a solid 8 to a 5.",5,5,12,13 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," There can never be another Wall Street
","What a silly movie. This film was unbearable. It was almost three hours of jocks doing drugs, sleeping with prostitutes, driving fast cars and giving pep talks about how being poor is bad and if you don't want to be rich go work at McDonald's. I mean seriously? In what world would half naked band players be allowed to prance around an office and women in thongs with their breast hanging out be allowed to literally ride men around the office while their colleagues both male and female cheered them on? Get real! All the excess sex and drugs was gratuitous. Just plain unnecessary. Did the director feel the film would not be effective without it? This was like watching a bad action movie filled with explosions to pull the audiences attention away from the actor's lack of talent. I'm glad I did not pay to watch this train wreck in the theater.",3,1,3,29 March 2014
The Wolverine," Snooze fest
","I don't understand how this movie is getting a 7.3 rating. I think a collective 5 would be more suitable. By the first hour I was wondering when it would be over. The only redeeming character was the little red head Japanese girl. Every body else was unconvincing as heck. Oh yeah and the acting sucked.I feel sorry for Jackman that he had to endure this script and be associated with this flop. Oh yeah and the grand, the silver samurai......oh what a great disappointment. This seems to be a recurring theme with super hero movies. th first 2 are mind blowing and the third is and abortion.This movie was not even memorable. As soon as I walked out of the theater I forgot what it was about.",4,6,13,31 July 2013
Creed II," Not as good as the first
",This movie was identical to Rocky III. I'm a huge Rocky fan and have watched all 5 movies many times. I was shocked at the similarities between Creed 2 and Rocky III. There was even a shocking and unnecessary similarity between Bianca and Adrian sitting ring side during the final fight. Their outfits were similar down to their beret. The movie was predictable and unticlimatic but I love Jordan so I enjoyed it.The acting was top notch and there was so much eye candy between Creed and Drago that everything else took second place. The training scenes are mesmerizing and the the fight scenes had me holding my breath. Neilson and Stallone were hard on the eyes.,8,0,1,2 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Perfect 10
","I was hesitant to watch this because man of steel was a little tacky with all the brand placement and excessive CGI fight scenes. This movie though wasn't as bad. The only brand placement was Chrysler. I loved that they kept all the elements of of the original man of steel movie. Everything flowed smoothly as far as why batman wanted vengeance against superman.I didn't like the fact that bats wanted to destroy sups without even trying to talk to him first or find out more about him. Wayne would not do something so rash. The Wonder Woman character was OK. She didn't appear that skinny in the movie. She also seemed tall which is consistent with the character.OK so to my favorite parts. Wayne doing that barbaric pseudo primitive workout in the cave without his shirt on made me drool. Thank you mr. director for all that eye candy. Oh and sups, I don't know how it's possible for a human to be so perfect. I mean really the guy is flawless. I love the chemistry he has with Louis lane. They seem like a genuine couple who are actually in love. Makes me like his character even more.Over all it was an awesome movie. Not too much unnecessary action. Beautiful cast. Can't complain.",10,5,12,3 April 2016
The Ringer," Disturbing and Embarrassing
","This movie was just plain disturbing to watch and it made me uncomfortable. It was funny until Knoxville went to the Special Olympics camp. It just didn't seem right that he should pretend to be special needs among actual special needs people. Then there were a few regular actors pretending to be special needs and going overboard with acting retarded, it down right made me uncomfortable.How in the world did the director think anyone would find scenes with special needs being made fun of humorous? I guess the costume people thought the only way to make a regular person look like they are special needs to make them wear a pair of glasses that will magnify their eyes. This entire fiasco of a movie was cringe worthy and unwatchable. It was truly embarrassing for the cast, especially the leads.",1,3,7,26 August 2014
Thor: The Dark World," As boring as the first.
","Didn't really want to go watch this because I didn't like the first installment and I should have stuck to my gut. This movie was boring and drawn out. It was a 3 at best but I gave it 1 more star for the awesome costumes. The Jane Foster character is boring and bland and her assistant is meant to be witty and a little wild but comes off superficial and vapid. She's not funny at all and does not balance Foster's character.Thor is great eye candy and so is Loki but that is about all Asgard has to offer. Thor going between Asgard and Earth did not add anything to the movie. The worst part of the movie was the fight sequence in the end. Thor and the villain tangled in a fight jumping from realm to realm for what seemed like 5 minutes was a total waste and didn't make any sense.I almost feel bad for Hemsworth and Portman being stuck in this awful project. I don't know why Portman would sign up for such an insipid project. All senseless action, barely a plot then a juvenile twist in the end in a feeble attempt to make people aware there will be another segment. This time I'll follow my gut and stay away.",4,1,3,19 November 2013
The Purge," Horrible!
","Seriously? The movie started out good. They lost me when the little boy disarmed the security system to let the bum in. Yeah, after that I lost interest in the movie. It turned from a potentially serious movie into a joke in the blink of an eye. Oh yeah then the bum gets lost in the gigantic house while the rebellious daughter's older boyfriend tries to kill her father. And the son is a little punk with a heart condition who wants to save the world.Oh and I almost forgot both kids keep running off in the pitch black house when their parents call to them. Did Hawke not read the script before he agreed to this mess? When did he become so desperate for a paycheck? This dud does not deserve any stars.",3,2,3,9 September 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla is the Man!
","So they did the old bait and switch with this movie. The ONLY reason I went to watch this movie was because of Bryan Cranston. I think he is an awesome actor and I love his work. To my dismay he was only a part of the film for the first 20 minutes before his character was killed. OK SOB's you got me. The Olsen girl should never be put in front of a camera again. Why can't she do like her sisters and waste away quietly? She has zero screen presence and whatever acting lessons she took was probably in her sleep. What a horrible miscast. Johnson can't act to save his life but he is so hot. Can't wait to see him put on a pair of tights in the next avengers movie.OK so besides that the movie was actually good. I liked the twist of making Godzilla the good guy. I also liked the mystery and suspense of not really showcasing Godzilla until the end of the film. Some scenes were just plain bizarre and out of place like Johnson and the Asian boy in the train and the camera focusing on the little girl before the tsunami. The kids could not act and just stared blankly at the camera, act therefore I felt no empathy or urge to protect them. Any who Godzilla was awesome and emerged the champion.",8,5,10,29 May 2014
The Thin Red Line," Perfect 10
","The fact that people call this film pretentious and boring blows my mind. I have watched it several times and every time it plays I am glued to the screen. This movie grips me. It grips my soul and my being. It is so beautiful yet so painful. Malick does a superb of conveying that these men are not only fighting a physical war, they are also fighting a mental and emotional war.I love the scenes of Caviezel interacting and frolicking with the locals. I love the scenes of Chaplin reminiscing about his wife. I love the stills of the grass blowing in the wind. It may seem insignificant to some viewers but showing it after specific acts meant so much. This movie is perfect. I honestly did not know it was almost 3 hours long. Even if it were 6 hours I would still be glued to the screen each time it played. A great piece of art work. Oh and the musical score is also one of the best.",10,4,7,23 November 2013
Her," Didn't really understand
","This film would have been a lot better without the gratuitous phone and OS sex scene. The movie seemed so cool and clean to me, everything from the décor and costumes to the extras and then it was soiled by the unnecessary smut like phone sex scene which added absolutely nothing to the film. Then the other drawn out sex scene between Theodore and his OS Samantha while the audience stares at a blank screen.why Mr. Jonze? Also I don't understand why the little snowman in the video game had to have such a filthy mouth. Why portray him as such a cute creature just to have him spew out so many expletives? All these things just did not seem to go with the movie. They seem to have been placed in there just for hell of it. I guess I just don't understand the director's vision but all these things knocked a few stars off my original rating.",4,4,10,17 January 2014
