Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disturbing, Distasteful, Disgusting
","I did not find this fit to watch. I took my nephew to see this at his request. He is sixteen and asked me to take him because of the 'R' rating. Since his parents were OK with it I decided to go with him. After 15 minutes of this piece of trash I had to take him out of the theater. I am all for free speech and would never censor anything. But this was over the top. It went from tasteless sexual innuendo about incest, to raunchy disgusting comments on incest. It went from antisemitic racism 'the Running of the Jew'. It was highly offensive and it didn't matter on what because it was offensive about everything. Those with a warped sense of humor may find it amusing but I did not. Don't take anyone under 18 to this movie.",1,19,41,6 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Excellent...but...
",Anyone who has read Tolkien's book knows that Peter Jackson took some dramatic license. Its obvious he's a fan of JRR's Book and does well to keep much of the story intact. I do however wish he would have kept 'The cleansing of the Shire' with all of its disturbing bits as well as its joyful and hopeful moments. The ending is not what it was intended to be and I wish he'd made an alternate ending.I do however like the pageantry of the coronation and the recognition of the hobbits as the saviors they were. It show well how the littlest person can make the biggest difference which is one of Professor Tolkien's themes in the book. It isn't often that a movie is good enough to live up to the book. The three movies as a whole do that and more. Where they come up short they more than make up for it in other ways. Great job Peter Jackson & the entire cast.,10,1,2,6 November 2006
