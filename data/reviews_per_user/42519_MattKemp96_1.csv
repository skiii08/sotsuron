Skyfall," Trust my word when i tell you that this experience is worth every penny and more!
","Of course you have heard nil but good things about the latest Bond movie, and let me assure you that they are nothing if not understatements. From the first scene we can see the fabulously filmed, action -packed intro's that Bond fans love so much, followed by a beautifully written intro sequence song performed by Adele. A key aspect of this film was the superb range of locations Bond is dropped in, from the urban, city lit-skyscrapers of Singapore to the rural moorlands of Scotland, viewers will never be short of a stunning piece of scenery every so often. An excellent cast really made this film the 9/10 it so definitely deserves, giving is the wonderful acting from Ralph Fiennes and Javier Bardem, who both give their characters that extra prominence. Now we all understand that a Bond film needs an imposingly brilliant antagonist that questionably Quantum of Solace was lacking However Skyfall really hit the nail of the head with the character of Silva, a sadistically, terrifyingly cynical baddie that really stands out from most villains. In summary, Skyfall was definitely the highlight of the film aspect of 2012, dominating the likes of Batman and the Avengers, making it a well- worth experience that will leave you thirsting for a suit on your body and a gun in your hands.",9,9,27,26 October 2012
