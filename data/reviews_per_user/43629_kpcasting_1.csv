"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," The Pitch: Chariots of Fire meets The Full Monty
","The feature film directorial debut of David Schwimmer is a good one. Never have I seen a movie that made jogging so entertaining. The ensemble cast is never off their mark in the 100-minute comedy. The script by Michael Ian Black and Simon Pegg hits the right notes and sets up a scenario that makes you root for someone who is quite unlikeable in the early moments of the movie. It's a particularly disciplined pairing of the two funny writers who keep the movie grounded in reality (or something close to it) as the film moves into the more outlandish second and third acts. Several times, the stakes are raised and supporting characters take center stage, stealing scenes with surprising and delightful frequency.Comedy is a genre notoriously overlooked by nominations and awards. Many critics quibble that performances in broad comedy is unrefined; I for one flatly disagree. Further more, I can't help but think that if there was an 'Oscars of Comedy' award show, Run Fat Boy Run would have been neck and neck with Juno in every category in 2007. By the time the film and Simon Pegg's character Dennis near the finish line, it becomes clear that hard work and persistence is the foundation to achieving personal goals. Something I don't mind being reminded of from time to time.",9,0,1,8 March 2009
