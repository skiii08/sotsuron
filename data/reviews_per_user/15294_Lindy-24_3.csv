The Blair Witch Project," This is a first, wanted to leave during 1st 1/2 hour
","Well this was a first for my husband and I.  Never wanted to leave in the middle of a movie before.  I know it was supposed to be a movie of a documentary (live footage), but this was bad.  Who wants to sit thru a movie where the footage shakes so bad you get motion sickness.  Not to mention the use of the F word every other word.  Maybe we missed something in this movie, but I doubt it.  If it was supposed to be a documentary, weren't we supposed to learn something?  Was this movie supposed to be scary?  Just not quite sure what the movie was supposed to be telling us.  I want my money back!!! Guess we should of researched this movie before going to see it. You can bet we will in the future.",1,3,4,14 September 1999
Con Air," Good MOVIE!!
","I loved this movie.  I hated Nicholas Cage in 'Raising Arizona' but hey, I'm willing to give him a second chance.  In his recent films, he has done his parts justice.  I liked his hillbilly, southern persona in this film.  I was really p***ed that he killed that guy and landed himself in prison just when he arrived home from service and reunited with his wife.  But it wouldn't of been the story without it huh :)  His character was really smart.  Your wondering the whole time if he is ever going to get home and see the daughter he has never met.  The psycho's in this film were great.  I especially loved the one that was a cannibal.  Why not!  sure it could happen.  A bunch of crazies hi-jack a plane.  I loved this movie for what it was.  Very good.",10,2,4,15 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Very good movie!
","The child actor (can't remember his name) and Bruce Willis had a chemistry between them that made this movie believable.  Very scary, the first ghost that came onto the screen made me jump about a foot out of my chair.  You had to feel for Cole and what he was going through.  Bruce Willis as the doctor trying to help this little boy but not believing him at first was heart wrenching.  The ending was superb.  Never saw it coming like you do in so many movies.  This movie is a must see.  Even if you don't usually like this sort of film.  THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE!!",10,0,0,15 September 1999
