The Blair Witch Project," Thats it?
","i cant understand how people can be scared by this movie, i only got irritated on the IDIOTS running around lost in the forest, and when it finally got to the final scene i thought ok here we go scare the living daylights out of me.. but it wasnt scary at all, all i can say is -Thats it?",1,2,3,26 October 1999
