"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Take a letter, Maria
",When few counties were pushing the boundaries of the LGBTIQ community this beautiful movie tested the waters. It made Australia grow up in an era when economically everyone wanted to go back to a more comfortable time. It came out around the same time as Muriel's Wedding which is equally about a run down family of characters who are better when they come together. This movie is a prime example of Australian cinema.,8,2,2,25 May 2019
10 Cloverfield Lane," Why did they wreck it?
","About 90% of the way through this movie I was thinking 'this is probably one of the Top 5 I've ever seen'. Then it ended. Probably the worst ending I've ever witnessed in a movie. All they had to do was cut to black after she went outside and took a deep breath. It could have been the perfect ending to one of the most intense movies. You never really knew if a twist was coming or not. Then, BOOM. From 10/10 to 7/10 because of the ending.",7,0,0,25 February 2019
Yesterday," These memories lose their meaning
","It probably helps if you're a fan of The Beatles as there is a lot of music in this. I love them so it's fine. The main two leads are wonderful in a fairly predictable love story.It's beautifully shot and a clever concept for a script. The premise is after the world forgets the music of The Beatles, one wannabe musician is the only one who remembers them and their music. So he capitalises on it and becomes a superstar.There is even a phenomenal moment when the main character goes to a seaside home which is brilliant but I won't spoil it.Himesh Patel is so likeable as Jack. He's a great singer and gives the character a wonderful charm. Lily James as Ellie is your Joey Potter 'girl next door in the friend zone' type and plays it well. She's gorgeous.Ed Sheeran takes the mickey out of himself well as the movie turns to satirise the music industry, particularly in the USA.The biggest letdown is Kate McKinnon. I usually like her but this role as the loud mouth unrelatable agent gets more screen time than she deserves - even interrupting the flow of some nice moments with unnecessary dialogue. It would have been better to show the disconnect between the two countries and their approaches to art. Instead all she talks about is taking his money. It's a weird character to have when we are used to Ari Gold-type characters who do anything for the stars they represent.Boyle gives the movie a modern feel while maintaining some bland hometown backdrops before ramping it up to major stadium performances.The two leads are fun to watch and if it introduces more people to The Beatles, that can only be a good thing.",8,0,1,16 July 2019
Schindler's List," You won't find a better film
","This is the most important story told on film. It's visually stunning, heartbreaking and graphic with some of the most horrible characters shown in movies. I wouldn't call it my favourite movie because something on this topic shouldn't be considered a favourite. Nor can you watch it all the time because it's so depressing. But without peer it is the greatest movie ever made.",10,1,5,11 February 2019
La La Land," My favourite movie
","The best movies ever made may be Schindler's List or The Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas or even Groundhog Day. But one movie stands out for me: La La Land.It's perfectly shot, the acting is underplayed in a time when most cinematic blockbusters overact like they are on stage with Jerry Springer. The music is exceptional and the colour is something out of a fairytale.I understand why people don't like musicals. That's your call. Don't rate it then. I don't rate superhero movies because I know the good guys will defeat the bad guys in a predictable monstrosity to chase revenue. This movie doesn't have fight scenes or a shootout or car chase - it's about one basic premise we all face in life - do you follow your dream or your heart?It's a combination of everything that's great about the movies and it shows restraint at the end when it could have easily chosen a different path for our couple.It's funny in parts, excruciatingly sad in others. It finds the perfect balance. It's a masterpiece.",10,6,8,7 February 2020
Life Is Beautiful," Love overcomes all adversity
",This movie doesn't trivialise the horrors of the holocaust. It's about sacrifice. Something maybe you only understand if you have children of your own. That no matter what - your job is to protect them. Your only reason for being- is their safety. I couldn't put myself in the position of how tragic the circumstances of any war would be. But I can put myself in the position of a father protecting his son. The love you have for a child surpasses anything. Benigni puts us in a world where the horrors of war have become part of everyday life and the only way to survive is through love. This story moved me when I first saw it in my teens. It still does.,10,2,3,24 February 2019
