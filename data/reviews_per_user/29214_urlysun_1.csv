Come and See," amazing film
","First of all I just want to say that I thank God that I have never been and never would want to be in a horrific situation in my life like the Russians did in Byelorussia. The handful difficult situations and sufferings that I have been through in my lifetime does not even compare to what these poor people had to go through. It is awful, horrible and traumatizing and those survivors' hearts and souls are marked for a lifetime. That memory of the act of inhumanity by the Nazis will never go away from their minds. It just brings about so many questions. Why did the Nazis think they were better than anybody else and have to commit murder? Why did Hitler come up with this ridiculous idea? It just makes me so angry to know that there are people that have this mentality of being better than others and have to kill them in a brutal way. The film was very difficult to watch because there is no happiness what so ever and its very disturbing and full of tragedy. To me the filmmaker obviously made this film because this tragedy remains in his mind and it has not been forgotten. It is a historical film for all who know about it and for the newcomers that are arriving into this world.",10,2,2,3 August 2009
