Hereditary," The Exorcist of our generation
","I enjoy horror movies but it is exetremely hard to find any that scare me. Hereditary is a film you cannot predict what will happen. It's original and terrifying with something to give in each scene. After seeing this film, it has made me want to read the bible because this film is hellishly terrifying!",10,3,7,29 June 2018
