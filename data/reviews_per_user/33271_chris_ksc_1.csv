Resident Evil: Afterlife," Afterlife: A fan service sequel.
","**SPOILERS**'Afterlife' offers a bit more familiarity for fans of the video game series. While I enjoyed the previous three movies, I found myself disappointed with the few crossovers there were from the video games. I'm not implying that movies try to replicate what the games offer, but seeing familiar aspects strikes that sense of nostalgia that makes fans go, 'Nice, I remember fighting those creatures.'The enemies are essentially the same as the ones from Resident Evil 5, namely the Majini, the Executioner, and of course Albert Wesker. I didn't mind that Anderson neglected to explain the origins of these 'elevated' monsters; the fact that they were included was a delight to see.I was also excited to see Ali Larter resemble more closely to Claire Redfield, and to see her serve more of a purpose in combat. The one-on- one combat with the Executioner is definitely the one of the strong points. Wentworth Miller is fine as Chris Redfield, though I'm hoping his character will be developed further in the next instalment. (Yes, there will be another one!)Aside from the visuals, everything else is still rather formulaic. The script is sub-par, and of course there are more characters to kill off, none of whom you would ever develop a connection with. Umbrella still proves to be an undying entity, continually and relentlessly hunting Alice and the humans. However, my major complaint regards the tacky parasite devices they used as mind-controlling devices. Did they run out of money to produce more believable parasites? They honestly look like McDonald's Happy Meal toys. In the video game context, the Majini are humans infected with a mind- controlling parasite called the 'plaga'. The Majini lack rational thought, but they still retain human-level intelligence. Anderson transported the 'plaga' concept in such a ridiculous way, it's embarrassing.For the casual viewer, I recommend attending on a cheap night. The 3D is a bonus, but I didn't feel it was necessary. 'Afterlife' is certainly more than just another zombie movie, but it will be the fans of the games who will have a greater appreciation of what the movie offers.",7,3,10,10 September 2010
