Back to the Future," IDEA
","At this point, a remake is just stupid. nobody has been able to make a film better than this and it may be decades before they ever do, but i doubt it!But, how about bring Doc and Marty back plus whoever is still alive within the creator aspect.The films were about the Deloreon time traveling the two to certain parts of time.. but what was Doc working on before he finally made the Deloreon?why was the deloreon able to be built in 1955?",10,0,0,19 August 2018
