The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Too cryptic for it's own good
","This movie is about a woman, or two women, who are spiritually connected like twins even though they were born in two different European cities, Paris and Krakow.  That's about all I can say about the plot of this movie because it leaves you guessing at everything else.  A bit of mystery and some unanswered questions that leave you pondering after a movie are okay, but this one left me thinking that the director and/or writer thought that their emotional imagery was enough and that the audience is owed nothing more.  I disagree.  This could have been a fantastic movie if there were more information provided.",6,8,19,24 May 2003
