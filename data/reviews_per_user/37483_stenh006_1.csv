The Monuments Men," At Least Ben Affleck Isn't In It
","Every jump cut is preceded by a bad joke that seems to beg the viewer to set the DVD on fire. If you peel apart the self-indulgent surface layers, it is possible to imagine a decent B-movie from the premise, but that only adds to the disappointment. It left me wondering whether Goodman and Murray owed George a favor of some sort, but then I remembered some of the other script choices in their past and it almost made sense. Connor Linnerooth sure looked good behind that statue though; I think he's finally found his talent-- hiding his face from any and all cameras. And hey, Matt Damon wasn't the worst part of a film for once. I just have one question: Isn't George Clooney a little old to be this pretentious? 2/10 F",3,1,2,4 December 2014
