The Ring," Great story which doesn`t live out of its effects
",In spite of great effects the movie builds up a tension which does not depend on effects or the spread of blood. There should be more movies like that with such a plot and creativity. That`s what makes this movie special. The reason for that may also be because the original was made in 1914 when special effects were not as available as they are nowadays.  I'm fed up with Hollywood-bulls**t and was very impressed to see something positive coming out of this machinery for making dumb people even more dumb. This movie represents everything what I expect from a horror. It gives you the creeps in every single scene. Great!!!,10,0,0,1 February 2003
