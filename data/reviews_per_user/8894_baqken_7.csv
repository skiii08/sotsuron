Iron Man 3," I thought it was alright
","I guess I should start off with the things I didn't like then wrap it up with the things I did.I can't say that I liked the first 30 minutes/hour of the movie. It took a while to build some momentum and get off the ground not to mention that it was extremely 'kiddie' at some parts; some of the lines in particular felt extremely corny to the point of being cringe worthy. At times it felt like I was watching a cartoon because of some of Stark's humor and I can't say that I liked the whole 'nerdy guy gets back and becomes a villain' clichÃ©, especially out of something as small as getting stood up by Stark on the roof. However despite this you'll have to accept that these movies are specifically geared toward a younger demographic and not the aging comic book fanbase. Another downside I felt was that it was a little too much like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang at parts specifically with the narration and the whole Christmas theme was a little forced.I was also pretty disappointed that there was NO AC/DC or Black Sabbath in the movie and got replaced by a generic superhero orchestra. I actually liked the Mandarin because it wasn't going to try to take a sensationalized anti-Eastern creation from a silver age of comics and try to apply it in a contemporary context. It was also a good way to have some sort of commentary as far as figureheads go, be it in the form of myths and/or symbols to perpetuate the initiatives of the state. I thought this was probably the most 'elevated' form of a villain I've seen in a comic book movie to date if anything.And even though the beginning of the film severely lacked it more than made up for it toward the last part with the action sequences. My jaw was literally dropped wide open at the scale and sheer artistry of the choreography. It made me glad that Shane Black took this movie up. This was the kind of action that made the movies of the 80s and 90s action films so memorable kids.If this was a concluding movie I think it capped off the story perfectly and I likened it over TDKR and its hamfisted Christ allegory.",6,0,5,3 May 2013
Man of Steel," Don't see it
","I've never felt so void of finding any redeeming qualities in a movie. If it weren't for Zod and Antje Traue I would've walked out and there are plenty of moments in the movie that will leave you with that gutted feeling. Krypton gets blown up, and Zod gets sent to the phantom zone, all in one go. The rest of the first act follows more or less the same rushed sense of pacing. You're just thrown from one event to another without any sort of momentum.Clark Kent is a fisherman=Clark Kent goes to the Arctic=Lois Lane keeps trying to find Clark Kent=Clark Kent finds Lois LaneYou see that? That's the movie.It's like the whole movie just meshed all the ideas they had on the drawing board at the time they came up with the idea for a Man of Steel movie, and threw them in this collage of non-linear ambiguity. Even the action manages to be pretty bad surprisingly enough, with none of the choreography being memorable for finally getting to see an A-list special effects treatment of a Superman movie; it's just Snyder slamming two action figures together for half an hour. As far as acting goes Shannon brings a lot of intensity to Zod that goes underused. Zod is probably the only guiding light in this ensemble. The script ends up failing this cast though. There are a lot of lines in the movie that are cringe-worthy, and moments that linger on this half-hearted/sappy sense of sentimentality for the Superman character that haven't really been earned (always accompanied by that somber 2 note piano chime). Speaking of Superman this is the first movie that manages to make Superman feel creepy. It makes sense if you think about it. You have this kid who is constantly told how special he is and he grows up to have this hyper-inflated sense of self-esteem, so much so that he'll even go through the trouble of telling you that, 'It's okay, I can do things most people can't.' Remember that kid Anthony in the Twilight Zone movie? That kid who could do whatever he wanted? That's Superman.You keep hearing how much of an impact Superman is going to bring to the world, and how he's destined for great things, this message was something that has been so forced down our throats through the advertising for the film, that you expect to get hit hard with some sort of broadened perspective about having faith in humanity, and being human, or being something greater, but none of it hits you the way it should, it just keeps getting harped on like some soulless mantra.This movie doesn't deserve a sequel or a Justice League movie, and I really wanted it to. It would've been nice to see what JJ Abrams would've done with Superman now, not back in 2006, but now. I think I'm going to keep watching Star Trek Into Darkness, or check out Lone Ranger. I wouldn't bother seeing this movie. If you're really, really, curious about it I'd wait for it on Redbox.",2,7,13,15 June 2013
X-Men: Apocalypse," X:Men Apocalypse---THE MADE FOR TV MOVIE
","I loved the Apocalypse storyline of the 90s animated series so I was pretty stoked about the idea of a movie centering around the Apocalypse character, it's a shame I have to live with it now.The new cast can't seem to hold up a movie on their own, McAvoy is a huge miscast 3 movies later, Fassbender struggles to hold up the movie. It seems like their veteran counterparts did most of the work these past couple of films.Apocalypse is terrible, I had reservations about him before, but you can tell they didn't know where to go with him or how to handle him so they kinda just piggybacked off of stargate. There's this strange pedo-like relationship he has with his younger horsemen. The wolverine cameo was so forced and out of place you'd think this were a superhero spoof movie.There's a random scene where the new gang of mutants goes to the movies and jean literally says 'At least we can agree on one thing: the third movie is always the worst' and it cuts back to the movie. The scene literally has nothing to do with the rest of the story its just spliced in there for some reason.Which begs me to question whether the cast knew how terrible it was and just did not care.",1,120,216,27 May 2016
Evil Dead," Not worth a matinée or a second viewing
","I always thought it was a little risqué voting movies on either sides of a scale as far as being way too negative (1/10) or way too positive (10/10) but I honestly believe this movie is deservedly a 1/10.I really don't want to spend most of this review talking about the details, it's pretty much the same thing from the original Dead, but each transition in the story is sloppy and careless.Bad things happen yet the movie fails to make me care about any of it.The transition from one event to the other gives little to no momentum for the overall narrative. Everything that transpires amongst the characters and the story as a whole is haphazardly thrown together if not just for the sake of adhering to the original Evil Dead movie and reminding you that you're watching the same movie.There is some macabre humor put in here and there but the execution of the story is so serious it would go over your head or get a delayed reaction.The violence in this movie is also radically over the top, and seems to be as jolted in as the rest of the plot points in the movie are. After seeing 'Drag Me to Hell' it would've been interesting to see Raimi take the helm but I'll be willing to wait for his next installment to his Army of Darkness (which I loved). See another movie.",1,168,352,5 April 2013
The Wolverine," Rent it
","I saw this on a whim and wasn't really looking forward to it, if anything I thought it be terrible, that being said thought it was much better than the Origins movie that came out a while back. The opening doesn't even feel like a big budget blockbuster flick, it's slow paced, well shot; it's a very different feel from the usual approach with these movies.Now I don't mean to say that it's a boring, drawn out, art house flick, but there is a level of care put to detail in this movie that goes over looked in most superhero summer movies at the expense of fast paced action and high stakes.Then right around the last act of the movie it takes a sharp left turn to the outlandlishly absurd. It really feels like two different movies, and I might even entertain the idea that the studio execs were responsible for that, seems like they got their dirty hands on it from that point on. The Silver Samurai scene is every bit as ridiculous as you'd expect it be, and the finale is totally anticlimactic. I wouldn't pay top dollar for it but I'd definitely watch it on a slow evening when the only thing on TV is a Lifetime movie. I wonder what Darren Aronofsky would've done with it had he not left it to work on Noah.",6,5,12,26 July 2013
Thor: The Dark World," About as flat as a lazy Saturday morning cartoon
","I'm not going into details about the movie because at the heart the problem Thor has is pretty simple: It ignores a lot of the motivations of the characters on a thinly laced plot.The first Thor took a while to grow on me, but it still outdoes the second installment. But why is it a better movie than the second installment? It's mostly because the motivations of the characters and villains are clearly laid out and establishes a better impetus with the story. Loki is struggling to find out who he is, Thor is trying to become who he is expected to be, and the frost giants work out the rough edges in the story arc, the same can't be said of The Dark World.You don't have any sort of interesting dynamics between the characters and instead get references to the first movie, or things that worked for the first movie, and try to play them out again. The movie never really picks up any identity for itself and just continues to harp on the events of the Avengers as well as the lead into new films of the franchise being its primary focus which makes the plot really spread thin and boring after a while.For the sake of not repeating myself, concerning the villain that is, I'll leave it at that. Save your money.",4,10,16,8 November 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," Yep it's great
","Washes out all the stank left over from these subversive ricer douchebag-custom car cliques the fast furious movies have spawned. That. Is. All.On a side note, I don't know how George Miller was able to get away with half of the stuff he got away with in this movie, but he really pushes the envelope as far as the ultra violence goes. The only gripe I DO have about this movie is how relentless it is. It does not let you breathe from one excellently crafted action sequence to the other. I would've left this review at the first sentence but too bad IMDb has a 10 line criteria.",9,17,34,25 May 2015
