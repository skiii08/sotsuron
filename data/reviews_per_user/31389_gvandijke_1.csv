Alien 3," Still a very entertaining movie
",Great Alien saga fan here.. not up there with Alien and Aliens but still a gripping well told movie.. Sigourney is a convincing bitter and scarred Ripley.. great chemistry with Clemens.. i rather like the general claustrophobic ambiance which is well depicted.. bleak.. dark.. depressing with a solid ending.. much prefer it to Resurrection.,7,1,1,14 March 2019
