United 93," What else can be said?
","If a film had to be made depicting the events of that dark September day, this is the perfect answer. The director brilliantly avoids making this a typical Hollywood production with heroes and villains, subplots, etc. There is ample drama in just depicting what really happened on Flight 93 based on what we know from passenger phone calls, ATC logs, data recorders, etc. The characterization of events of the actual hijacking,rebellion, and eventual crash of United 93 depicted in this film almost certainly match what actually occurred.I respect how the film portrays the events from the terrorists' point of view without passing judgement. They were undoubtedly scared as well, but driven by their loyalty to their cause and the glorification of their god. That said, we should never forget the courage and ultimate sacrifice given by the passengers of Flight 93 who tried in vain to save the lives of others. This film will forever remind us of their valor.",10,5,9,1 April 2008
