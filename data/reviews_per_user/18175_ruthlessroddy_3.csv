Ford v Ferrari," 'That's my Lama bite!'
","Really good movie. Not even a racing fan, but Bale and Damon click from the word go, both with their humor and dramatic skills on display. I also knew nothing of the real story, which made for some surprises. Then ending shot says a lot as well.Well done!!!",9,1,2,18 November 2019
The Favourite," Bottom Line *Spoiler alert*
","Of the three ladies, nobody won, certainly not Abigail, who claims she did near the end by reminding Sarah how she was readying to leave in a carriage, while Abigail herself was about to be brought something called 'A Pineapple.' Meanwhile, fast-forward to the end, and there's Abigail's working on the Queen's leg, and other anatomy, far from looking like she had 'won', appearing about as happy as Queen Anne looked numb while receiving her offering.",7,2,3,2 January 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Why the ending is so moving
","I myself, like most people, love this movie and whenever it got to the end where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it always sent chills through my soul, but I realized that in addition to that sequence, where not a word is spoken between the two men, it's that 'deep blue ocean' that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN hit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL things.",10,2,3,10 January 2007
