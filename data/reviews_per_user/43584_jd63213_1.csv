The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Has It's Moments
","It's always interesting when someone writes, adapts, directs, and produces their own film. You get a real chance to see someone's artistic vision portrayed on screen with very little outside influence.This film moves alone okay, Logan Lerman is good as Charlie, but Emma Watson and Ezra Miller as siblings Sam and Patrick are the real stars here. Everything moves along nicely as a standard teen drama about the new/awkward kid at school with some fun (if clich√©) party and dance scenes.Then the movie takes a serious turn as it delves into the pasts of the main characters and becomes depressing and drawn out until the conclusion.In the end I would say it's worth watching, and the actors clearly had a great time filming it.",Null,0,1,27 June 2013
