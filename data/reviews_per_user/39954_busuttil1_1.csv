The Hangover," Didn't laugh once. Overrated.
","So, I've heard many good things about this film. I was told that it would be one of the funniest films that I've ever seen, I've heard people say that it's outstanding, and some people have said that it's the best comedy of the past decade. So, I thought, I should watch it to see how good it is. I don't really regret watching it, but to be honest, that was long droning monotony. I enjoyed the storyline and some bits were quite amusing, but I merely grinned at it. How this gets 7.8, I'll never know, because the point of a comedy film is to make me laugh, but really the only thing that was keeping me watching was the fact that the storyline wasn't actually too bad. Hence, I gave it a five. This might be the definition of an average film. Massively overrated.",5,6,12,30 March 2013
