Iron Man 3," He still is Iron Man
","We've all seen the trailers. And we've all probably built up a certain vibe about the movie - that its taking the dark route a.l.a. DC movies. So, if it doesn't end up living up to that vibe that its built around itself, its bound to disappoint viewers, mildly or hugely. Because in this case, the dark route actually seemed like a perfect fit for the third installment.Sample this: After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark suddenly realizes that there are other supremely powerful beings in existence, that he's not alone, and that when compared with the others, he's certainly not the strongest of the bunch. So he develops post-traumatic stress, starts getting anxiety attacks, and in the process has built himself an army of suits - an Iron Legion - all because he just doesn't feel safe anymore. This causes friction between him and everyone else he knows - between him and Pepper and their romance, between him and Rhodey and their friendship, and between him and Happy affecting their bonding. Lots of room for exploration there right ??? Add to that, an emerging terrorist threat in the form of The Mandarin whose organization, The Ten Rings was alluded to in the first movie and you have an opportunity to bring things a full circle. The Mandarin being Iron Man's most prominent foe in comic book legacy only helps.But sadly, it looks like the movie doesn't care to exploit all of these to their fullest. I'm not saying it doesn't use these issues at all, Tony's vulnerabilities are played out brilliantly. Its just that they could have done so much more with this material and the trailers gave us reason after reason to expect that they have that we end up a tad bit dissatisfied or should I say even mildly frustrated. And the pacing of the movie is quite feverish which isn't a problem if the characters are involving enough. But when they keep spurting out one-liners after another with a comic intent, it gets a bit irritating. Again, I'm saying a bit and not hugely irritating.There's no reason to scoff at the movie's production values. In fact, being a Marvel movie, I shouldn't even be commenting on how amazing the visuals are, or with Black at the helm, the action is top-notch. It would simply be wasting characters in this review if details are described. But yes, the airplane crash and the subsequent fall sequence deserves mention - its the only sequence in the movie that gave me real goosebumps. I'd say that sequence makes up for some of the movie's flaws never mind the brief duration that it last's for.Downey is at the top of his game here. He plays a more mature, sensible and disturbed Stark unlike the jolly good alcoholic of the previous movies. However he does retain his sense of humor which is good in a way but not so good when done excessively. The girls get little screen time but give in their best. As for the bad guys, they're all effective and any further comments on their performance would mean spoiling a big twist in the movie.With Iron Man 3, Marvel's Phase II has begun. And while this may not be the best of starts, its certainly not a bad one by any means. A little bit of fine tuning and even sticking to the vibe the trailers projected would have made this movie a serious force to bicker or reckon with. As it is though, Iron Man 3 is a pretty decent summer flick. Just don't expect anything extraordinary out of it.I was about to give it a 7, but I'll raise the score by 0.5 for Downey's performance and for the airplane sequence.Score: 7.5 / 10",7,1,4,28 April 2013
The Terminator," A sci-fi tech-noir classic
","This was one of those early movies that drew me in to the world of Hollywood. Of course, when I first watched it, I didn't have much idea about what went behind the scenes when making this movie. But now that I do, my respect for this movie has grown tremendously given what it was able to accomplish on such a low budget with such a small set of characters making what could have easily been a B-movie in the wrong hands seem like a solid sci-fi story ending with an epic feeling of the things to follow.The movie begins with what is possibly one of the coolest title cards for a 1980s flick with Brad Fiedel's iconic Terminator theme playing in the background as the cast is listed in the form of messages displayed from a computer terminal. This is followed by the Terminator and the human making their appearances from the future into our present, gathering clothes and weapons and heading out in their own respective ways in the search for Sarah Connor, a teenage girl part-timing as a waitress upon whose survival rests humanity's future as both she and us learn later. What follows is a cat and mouse game where the human goes all out to protect her and the Terminator is all out to get her and it won't stop, literally right till the end.What separates this movie (and its immediate sequel) from the 'other' sequels is James Cameron's balancing act who, much like Spielberg, allows the story to take center-stage and drive everything else and has perfect control over the length of sequences, edits, camera cuts and angles. 10 minutes into the movie and you're in, drawn to this world, completely forgetting that the futuristic crafts and landscapes are miniatures with absolutely no chance of being drawn out of this world. While I didn't find the characters to be groundbreaking or as interesting as in other dramas, the plot was extremely well constructed and allowed for some really cool paradoxes that would make for some interesting discussion (would John Conner even exist if he hadn't sent Kyle back in time).The effects deserve special mention too. It is incredible how much Stan Winston's crew and Fantasy II were able to achieve at the time. All the futuristic scenes, the sequence with the Terminator treating his injuries, the chase sequences and the entire ambitious final act all work and some of them still hold up three decades later. And Brad Fiedel's theme gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, as if signaling an impending apocalypse.All the actors do well in their respective roles, particularly Arnold who shines in a part that seemed almost tailor made to suit his acting capabilities. But it is Cameron who is truly the star of this endeavor, believing in his project and driving it to execution. Thank God for the success of this movie, which gave us many more masterpieces by Cameron. But then, it was entirely deserving of it. A sci-fi tech-noir classic.Overall Score: 8.0 / 10.0",8,3,3,2 May 2015
Fast & Furious 6," As if a Tank wasn't enough, they got a Plane too
","Fast & Furious over the last few installments has become all about action. And the latest outing takes it a step further. Almost 20% of the movie is comprised of action sequences. And at the expense of action, plot, writing, characters all take a backseat. But no one's complaining. Why ? Because the action makes up for all of it.Do the above statements sound cliché ??? The movie's plot is full of such silly dialogs so its best ignored in the current context. What works is the action - Lin and his crew bring us some of the most ridiculously outrageous and boldly conceived action sequences. There's an intense chase through London in the initial reels and also a race later on. There's a whole plane take-off-crash sequence towards the end that you've probably got a glimpse of in the trailers. The girls are no slouches either and we see an intense hand-to-hand fight of sorts between Michelle Rodriguez's Letty and Gina Carano's Riley.But the movie's best sequence is undoubtedly the 10 minute Tank chase across the freeway that involves most of the cast and culminates in a breathtaking 'catch' (about which I'd not say any further). The camera cuts like crazy, music is pulsating and that single sequence is probably worth the price of the movie ticket.Apart from action, Furious 6 doesn't have much going for it. Dialog is standard, at times even silly and predictable, characters are flat, performances are decent. The car chases and night scenes got me so involved, I actually felt a bit strange leaving the theater and coming out into the real world's broad daylight. And the post-credits scene is simply, a treat which makes the next installment in the series worth looking forward to. Suffice it to say that in the end, the movie drifts full circle.Watch it for the action, and for the action alone. If you expect any sort of character development or family issues like the first installment had, you'll be disappointed. Else, you're in for one hell of a ride.Score: 7 / 10",7,66,141,26 May 2013
Oblivion," The visuals are surely not prone to Oblivion
","In a vast seemingly endless landscape, Jak travels on a bike surrounded by what appears to be the remnants of the Manhattan Bridge. In another shot, Jak's Bubbleship circles a destroyed football stadium which hosted the last Superbowl before the alien invasion that destroyed earth. These are simply two of the many shots that you see in Oblivion showing a ravaged Earth circa 2077. And they're a sight to behold no matter the countless times such sights have been and shall continue to be shown on celluloid. The effects blend in seamlessly and after the initial few shots, it ceases to matter what's real and what's digital.For a futuristic sci-fi that claims to be original (and it is if Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel by the same name is considered just that: unpublished), Kosinski nails the look and atmosphere. But then, Kosinski's already done that in Tron: Legacy, his last outing, which was no less of a visual achievement by any means. Fortunately, at least for me, this one comes out to be a tad bit better than his previous attempt.Jak Harper and Victora a.k.a. Vika work as a team with Vika serving as the operator and Jak handling the drone maintenance work on Earth: repairing drones that have been programmed to destroy any alien life on sight. Earth was destroyed in an alien attack 60 years ago and while the humans won the war, the planet was sabotaged beyond habitation. On one of his routine missions, Jak encounters a flying object that crash lands on Earth. It turns out that there were five objects housing humans with one of them resembling a woman Jak has been seeing frequently in his dreams. Jak rescues her and the real story takes off from there.Joseph Kosinski takes the simple route and has the film begin with a narration by Cruise explained the aforementioned scenario. Perhaps he chose to do it because the film already has plenty of surprises in store in the second half and as such, there was no need to obscure Earth's current situation. As expected, the movie feels like a well polished product in all departments. Cruise, Olga and Andrea turn in pretty decent performances despite having no distinct character arcs to follow. Cruise in particular gives in a very, shall I say, sincere performance playing it low key. Freeman essays his cameo with ease. The Zimmerish music does get a bit repetitive and generic but manages to keep the tension at appropriate levels which suits my tastes so that'll be a plus for me. And thankfully, the movie refuses to go all out into Haloesque action mode for a long time with the action being interspersed and well spaced and most importantly, kept to as much as is required and no more.What you will take in the end with Oblivion are the visuals. Lets face it, by the time the whole movie ends, you'll realize all the plots elements have been borrowed from a flick or two in the past. But these days, its not only about an original plot but an original execution. And for a movie that's not a remake, or a sequel, or an established comic book or adapted novel, Oblivion does the job. It may not be an Avatar but Oblivion is decent enough for a one time watch. And going by the visuals, that watch is best suited for the big screen.Score: 7.5 / 10",7,2,4,14 April 2013
Man of Steel," They almost had it !!!
","Now I guess a lot of people are simply going to 'Disagree' with this review once they see the rating and the heading. After going through a lot of the reviews posted on this recently, I get the trend - you hate this movie even a bit and you have 20% of the audience disagreeing; you love it and 80% agrees with you. While I'm not at the end of either side as my score illustrates, I do believe the movie is slightly disappointing.This being a Superman movie and the board being filled with Superman fans, lets not even discuss the plot. Instead, I'll straightaway get to the points. To begin with, here's what I liked about the movie: Action & Effects: As much as the critics will bash it, I'll admit the action in the movie is simply spectacular, very literally of epic proportions and quite out of this world. In fact the trailer of this movie has more action than the whole of Superman Returns and the trailer contains only about 5 - 10% of the action. The best scenes are in the end when you see Superman flying at breakneck speed and slamming Zod - intensely gratifying. Story & Script (If I understand the term Script correctly): Nolan and Goyer wrote and conceived the story together with Goyer then writing the screenplay. I must admit that this is definitely a very unique take on Superman, the likes of which we've never seen in any Superman movie or comic. The ideas presented are interesting and one plot point gradually leads into the next instead of scenes being forced. And the ending is simply brilliant. Performances: Shannon as Zod is exceptional. Cavill as Superman is also intense. And both the fathers add their unique paternal touches. Everyone else plays their part convincingly. Score: Hans Zimmer. That epic score running in the battles scenes. It doesn't get any bigger and better. Enough said.Now, onto the dislikes: Zack Snyder: I seriously didn't like his direction. He overuses Zimmer's score, inserts random flashbacks and focuses much more on action when instead he could have given time to characters like the Kents, Perry and Lois (though she does get a lot to do). Although the story had the world 'reacting realistically' to Superman's arrival, we rarely get those moments save one or two shots of people staring in the sky reminiscent of standard disaster flicks - meaning, nothing different. I guess Nolan in the chair could have made a huge difference. Cinematography: The hand-held work, while good enough in the action scenes, totally sucked during character interactions. I mean, when Jonathan is talking to kid Clark, the camera shakes so much to make it 'seem real' that it looks like those scenes were shot with a Galaxy SIII with stabilization turned off. I doubt shaking the camera that much was the best way to achieve realism with the 3D making it even worse. Steady camera shots focusing on the actors could have a more powerful effect if not more. Miscellaneous: Characters rarely get beyond a point (lets hope there's more of that in the sequel). The only exception is Zod who is far far better than what he was in Superman II - and yup, you actually empathize with him. The first meeting of Lois and Clark is not what people would expect and hope for (yet seems to be the only way to progress the story forward it seems). The 'realistic' portrayal they were so talking about seems completely lacking as well.So many hits and yet so many misses. While Man Of Steel is certainly a good movie, it was destined for greatness which it never manages to fully achieves. This, and not the movie, is the reason for my disappointment. Nevertheless, it certainly deserves a watch on the big screen. The action alone is worth it.Score: 6.5 / 10",7,0,1,16 June 2013
Spider-Man," Here comes the Spider-Man !!!
","Fresh and Energetic. If I were to describe this movie in two words, the aforementioned ones would be it. Right from the first scene itself, you feel as if you've been sucked into the world of high school student Peter Parker. And you realize that it's not as bright and nice as it should've been.The movie serves as an origin story to Spider-Man. It shows the transition of Peter Parker from a nerdy, butt-of-all-jokes high school student, to a slightly more confident and arrogant personality to, eventually, a responsible superhero in the form of Spider-Man. No point in discussing the plot here as its fairly predictable and spilling the beans here itself would make it more so. Sam Raimi's direction is excellent and the movie is a thrill ride from start to end. The performances are utterly convincing. Hats off to Tobey Maguire, after viewing this movie, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend any alternative for the role of Peter-Parker / Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is also convincing as Mary Jane Watson - the next door neighbor and childhood crush of Parker. So is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne - the businessman who later on, after experimenting with a performance enhancing drug in a laboratory, turns into his alter ego, the Green Goblin. And so are the others.The film is great technically as well with its brilliant cinematography which has the camera swooping up and down buildings and New York streets at a breathtaking speed. The art design is also great and has been used appropriately to handle and provide us with some memorable sequences (special mention goes to the Unity Fair sequence at Times Square). The visual effects, while good, are something which I found below par at times (again note some of the shots of the Goblin at the Unity Fair sequence; it's clearly evident that there's some mixing and matching being done here). Maybe this was because of the color schemes of the lead characters because of which they had to be shot separately which may have been responsible for this. Danny Elfman's music is also very good; the best piece being the opening theme.What is so endearing about the movie that it has a heart and soul of its own. It becomes clearly evident while watching the movie that the makers of the movie are extremely passionate about Spider-Man. And that passion is visible in every frame of the movie - be it the action sequences, the characterizations or otherwise. It has become difficult for me to imagine another team behind the future installments of this movie. Before viewing this movie, I only knew about Spider-Man from some of the cartoon shows that used to appear on Television about him. Now, after seeing this movie, not only has my interest in Spider-Man sky-rocketed, but I consider him to be the most intelligent and the best superhero amongst the lot of fictional superheroes. Fantastic stuff.",8,0,1,21 August 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Review of the Rise of the Planet of the Apes
","A glimpse of this movie's trailer at a suburban mall is what caught my attention. It seemed like an interesting concept - apes taking over the world, getting intelligent. More research revealed that this is actually a part of a series (although not in a direct way) about apes ruling a planet. Information gave rise to curiosity and finally turned into enthusiasm which is when I decided to give this movie a shot. And it didn't disappoint.The story should be familiar to people aware with the series - a new drug is being developed by a scientist Will Rodman to cure Alzheimer's. The drug is tested on a chimp who is killed while trying to defend her baby. The baby chimp then inherits the mother's genes and intelligence which develops far more than what the drug's maker's anticipated. What's interesting is the way this movie has been presented to people who are unfamiliar to the series - no worries, you're not at all gonna feel out of place. So, you definitely don't need to go through the previous movies to watch this one.There's little of character development or outstanding performances here (excepting the main chimp Caeser that is who gets both of these). What makes the movie work at least for me is the writing and the direction. Watch the scene when Caeser defends Will's Dad. Endearing and mesmerizing. The effects are awesome as well. Its hard to believe that so much could be achieved for a relatively small budget (about $90 million). I guess when it comes to top notch visual effects at a relatively low cost, Weta is the one to approach. They could create a whole planet in Avatar for $237 million, the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy for about $300 million and also did the aliens in District 9 for $30 million. Need I say more ??? The movie has a really fresh feel to it - it has that typical summer science-fiction feel to it yet it is much more than that. It only runs too short - a little more time, say a run time of about 2.5 hours would have given the movie enough time to establish the characters and would have made it a masterpiece on the lines of Peter Jackson's King Kong. Its perhaps because of the short run time that Freida Pinto's and James Franco's characters get limited screen time and scope to perform. Nevertheless, for all that it is, this is a great summer movie with an outstanding performance by Andy Serkis as Caeser and a technically sound film in all departments (cinematography, VFX, production design and the likes). In short, its all that I expected it to be. If you do not have a problem in suspension of disbelief, I strongly recommend this movie !!! Score: 7.5 / 10",7,1,4,7 August 2011
2012," The Trailer was a Masterpiece - The Movie, not quite
","When I first saw the Teaser for this film (way back in July), I had a feeling that this could turn out to be a masterpiece. The second trailer released later only seemed to strengthen my beliefs. It's only when I saw the five-minute clip that I started having my doubts - after all, I was seeing a scene play out from the movie (almost) exactly the way it was meant to be seen. My doubts were confirmed as I watched this movie today (as a matter of fact, I'm writing this review just an hour after I saw the film).There's very little of a premise or plot here (which, though expected, is disappointing). An American scientist learns from his Indian friend that the Earth's crust is heating up and proceeds to warn the White House about the same. The U.S. President, together with the heads of the other nations chalk out a plan to assure the survival and existence of human species. Meanwhile we have Jackson Curtis, a writer cum limo driver who is going through a troubled relationship with his wife and kids. After some initial build up (as is the case with all of Emmerich's disaster films), the world starts coming to an end.From here on, the film becomes more of a CGI spectacle with Curtis and his family escaping one disaster after another. And therein lies one of the fundamental flaws in the movie. The family manages to make many nail-biting escapes (as is visible in the five-minute clip) which, after a while becomes a bit tedious to watch. Sure Emmerich tries to make up for it by killing off some characters (which I would rather not reveal) but by then, you've already lost most of your interest.Also, there's not much of a back story behind the doomsday and build-up to the D-day becomes a tad too predictable. It would have interesting to have got some more insight into the end-of-the-world prophesies. It almost feels as if the actors are trying too hard to be serious while none of it transfers to the viewer.The performances come across as average although I really liked John Cusack as Jackson Curtis as the writer - limo driver. The effects are quite well executed and although at times you can make out it's CGI, I believe it is still the main reason why most of the people are seeing the film (and it better be the only one).On the whole, although I liked the movie as a whole, I really hoped for it to be better (at least as compared to Emmerich's previous disaster flicks). Perhaps Roland's insecurity after 10,000 BC prompted him to cram this movie with as many effects as possible which makes it nothing more than an apparent excuse to make a disaster flick. So I suggest those who can be quenched by VFX alone, go for it. Expecting anything different would only be a disappointment for you.Score:6.0/10",6,1,2,17 November 2009
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A little short of the first but a solid entertainer none-the-less
","In a way, it was inevitable. The massive expectations from the sequel to the $1.5 billion grossing and incredibly charming Avengers had shot up so high, the movie was bound to disappoint at some level. And at some level it does, though not to the extent that it can be called a grossly underwhelming disappointment as is being hailed by the media and professional critics. The movie does have its moments, it works for the most part, but just falls short of the first one. In the interest of North American viewers who get this flick a week after international viewers, I'll keep this review completely spoiler free while hoping that it doesn't feel too generic.The movie's plot, no matter how well written, is pretty standard science-fiction stuff: A robot decides that eliminating humans is the best way to achieve worldwide peace and begins by hatching a scheme to start by eliminating humanities saviors first - The Avengers. That two of the Aveners themselves are responsible for its creation could make for an interesting face off between the creator and the creation. Except that it doesn't.One of the complains I have with this one is that the dialogue didn't feel as sharp as the first one. In The Avengers, Tony Stark for instance had some amazing lines and so did Steve Rogers. And their banter, while pretty interesting, was entirely in character. Here, both characters seem to have lost their wit / charm. Now fans may justify this as a result of what these characters went through in their respective standalone films but I feel the writing has a lot to blame. Stark's dialogue during the Hulk v/s Hulkbuster fight sequence is an example; his lines are so bland and generic that Downey himself could have done better if he had simply improvised. Something similar applies to the film's humor; while there were sequences of absolute hilarity amongst the characters in the first film, most of the humor falls flat in this one. All these minor squabbles could have been forgotten if the movie had a great plot. But with something like a robot out for human extinction ending in an equally generic save the city standoff make these flaws stand out even more.Most movies with a mediocre plot manage to compensate for their shortcomings through some spectacular action sequences. This however, is not Age Of Ultron's strong point either. Most of the action is too heavily edited to be able to follow and the ones you can seem like they were designed by the visual effects crew on an ad hoc basis. And its about time Marvel did away with Brian Tyler and brought a different composer to the mix; the only good themes heard in Age Of Ultron are the ones lifted straight from Alan Silvestri's score in The Avengers and Danny Elfman's slightly modified version of Silvestri's Avengers Theme. Compared to the first one's score which was much more memorable, this one's rather forgetful. And despite a 140 minute runtime, a lot of sequences feel rushed. I guess this has to do with Whedon trying his best to give every character his due and should this movie have an extended edition, it would certainly be one to watch out for.Now that all the negative stuff is out, here are some of the positives. First off is Ultron and Spader's terrific portrayal of the robotic psychopath (that voice) and Whedon's terrific treatment. Despite his rather clichéd mission, Spader and Whedon make Ultron sound utterly convincing and at times, logical when things are viewed from his perspective. He wants to eradicate humanity so its rather obvious to start with the ones who guard it - The Avengers. Also well done are some bits with Thor's hammer and the following which stand out.<ul><li>The party sequence. Thor's expression when Rogers tilts the hammer is priceless (Again, the music sucked; they should've kept the one in the trailers) </li></ul><ul><li>The Vision. He's a welcome addition and his sequences are bound to spark fan debates </li></ul><ul><li>The sequence with the city. Some pretty wondrous effects that had the audience gasping </li></ul><ul><li>The mid-credits scene. Its tiny but pretty significant in terms of plot enhancement. And there is no post-credits scene </li></ul><ul><li>Hulk v/s Hulkbuster. Its good in parts, but not entirely</li></ul>When The Avengers came out back in 2012, the kind of shared universe cross-referencing was a novelty that made it an event. It was as close to comic books as movies could get in terms of continuity. With so many shared universes announced, it seems that this novelty factor has wore off resulting in Age Of Ultron a good movie but not a great one. It is certainly a treat that comic-book fans owe themselves and the comic-book audience has a lot to cheer for. For the casual moviegoer, this will just be another good movie. Regardless, critics be damned and tomato-meter scores aside, this is a movie you should not miss.I'm heavily conflicted between scoring this with a 7.0 or a 7.5. I'll stick with a 7.0 for now and revisit the rating after subsequent re-viewings !!!Overall Score: 7.0 / 10.0",7,5,12,26 April 2015
Avatar," Everything that it promised it would be. Believe the hype !!
","After Titanic (1997) Cameron literally disappeared from mainstream Hollywood for over a decade. Apparently he spent most of that decade on this film - developing the technology, the script and a new language polishing it in every possible way. I have always yearned about how all the good old classic films came out at a time when I was just unable to visit movie theaters (either because I did not exist or for some other reason). As such, I was very keen to see this supposedly 'path-breaking' movie in its full glory - which is what I did. And I'm certainly glad I did it for Avatar is not just a movie, but (literally) an experience which I will cherish for the rest of my life.There is no need for me to waste space on telling you the story since by now everybody is well aware of it. Although the story may appear simple, its treatment and translation on screen comes out effortlessly and credit for this must go to Cameron, for his direction is such that you're never left with any dull moments in the film. The movie proceeds at a brisk pace so much so that 15 minutes in the movie you find yourselves on Pandora itself.Technically, the film just shines on every level, be it the cinematography, the effects and the sound. Although the CGI aliens had a cartoonist feel in the trailers, this is quickly dispelled by watching them on the big screen. As for the camera-work, it looks as if Cameron was able to enter the virtual world of Pandora and shoot just as if he were shooting in a real world - you not only get the overview shots that display the beauty of Pandora but also the shaky cam effect so common in The Bourne Trilogy - only seeing it in a virtual world is an altogether different effect.As for the planet, it is simply a beauty and in this age of vulgarity and cheap humor it appears as a marvelous piece of art. Most of the CGI sequences are created from scratch but is appears as though this planet has been built separately first following which the actors have shot in the virtual world. The leaves and dust flowing around effects are so seamlessly done that you may be fooled for a second or two into thinking that it's real despite knowing it's CG at the back of your mind.The movie however shines when viewed in 3-D. As already mentioned by many people, the 3-D is seamless - it is not forced at every opportunity but is created with the purpose of taking you a step closer towards Pandora. Special mention must go to the cockpit sequences - they successfully convince you into believing you're riding in it. I was initially skeptical of the 3-D after viewing the negative comments regarding the glasses, dark unclear images, headaches and the like but I've experienced none of those issues (the very fact that I'm writing this shows that I'm not on a headache). This movie is simply meant to be seen in 3-D regardless of the ticket price.The only things I found lacking (fans may ignore this) were a little less character development and a little less detail. I loved the scriptment (yes I read it beforehand and still loved the movie) - it had so much detail and everything was explained in a crystal clear manner. In the movie, you're on Pandora within 15 minutes. Because I already knew all the details (I was tracking this movie for the last 3 months) I did not have a problem. Not sure about some others though. I'm now convinced that the future earth sequences should have been included.In summary, Avatar has everything a movie should have - a story, emotions, characters (albeit a little less developed) and fantastic direction being the prime requisites. The technical achievements only raise the quality of the movie and take it up by many notches. And the 3-D converts this movie into an experience which will stay with you for a long time. The is not just a movie - it's an event. Those missing it experience of a lifetime or compromising on it's quality for a few dollars are definitely going to be sorry 20 years into the future. Those that do not will be smiling at themselves, relishing it and narrating it to their kids with pride. After all, it's not often that a Star Wars arrives which we can catch in theaters. Fortunately, it's our successors that are unlucky this time.Score: 9/10",9,4,9,24 December 2009
3 Idiots," Good. But misses the Bullseye !!!
","It certainly is all over town. Aamir's next has been hyped immensely and it's not surprising if you are not able to find a movie ticket this weekend. But at the end it all boils down to the question - is the movie worth all the hype ?? After watching it, I can say that the answer (quite disappointingly) is no.Two college friends - Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) embark on a journey to find the third friend / Idiot Rancho (Aamir Khan) who mysteriously disappeared after college five years ago. The film's story is told through flashbacks as the characters journey to Shimla in search of Rancho - the person who managed to change their outlook towards life.The problem with 3 Idiots according to me is that although it tackles a very complex issue, it chooses to do so in a light-hearted way which essentially converts this movie into a comedy (something present in abundance in B-Town). No doubt the humor is top-notch and keeps you rolling in laughter but the movie simple fails to connect you emotionally with the characters as opposed to, for example, Taare Zameen Par (2007) which I feel, after watching this, is far more superior in terms of characterization and emotional depth. By the time it reaches the climax, you can well anticipate almost everything that would happen.As for the performances, they are top-notch. Undeniably, Aamir is one of the finest and this movie reaffirms this. However, what most people seem to be forgetting is that there are two more actors in this movie who, given the opportunity, are as capable as Aamir themselves. First R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi is simply brilliant. Watch the scene wherein he tries to explain his point of view to his parents. Next, Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi really shines not just in the comic sequences but in the more serious ones (which the movie has very few). Revealing the sequence in which he shines may act as a potential spoiler but watch out for a scene in the principal's office in which the principal asks him to type a rustication letter. Kareena Kapoor is really a thorn in this movie and her romance with Aamir is something that should have been either toned down or chopped off. Omi as the ideal geek is impressive (more so than Kareena).The cinematography is good and breathtaking in the opening song where the lush greenery of Shimla is captured with such finesse that it induces a sense of wonder. The music is good but the songs have not been used that effectively. For instance, 'Give Me Some Sunshine' not only has weak choreography, but it comes at a moment which severely reduces its impact. The promo featuring that song was far superior (in fact that was what fooled me into believing that this movie could end up as a masterful lesson in life). Some of the sequences could have been trimmed down.On the whole, although 3 Idiots is a good movie, it is hard to understand people calling a masterpiece or a breakthrough in cinema. Movies like Taare Zameen Par (2007) or even Hirani's own Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) are better movies as compared to this. Nevertheless, the movie does provide some really good entertainment so if you're looking forward to just relax and chill out, go for this. For those however seeking some serious depth and a perspective in the life of an engineer, I'd say the movie tries and succeeds in parts but an engineer's life and the pressures s/he faces are a different game altogether. Although the movie it enjoyable, it is far from authentic. And this comes from an Engineer (although an Idiotic one). Now I may get a lot of sore thumbs down on this one but this in my opinion on this movie written in all earnestness. Don't enter this movie with high expectations and you may perhaps find that All Izz (Indeed) Well !!!Score: 7.0/10.0 !!",7,5,12,28 December 2009
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The last of Middle-Earth
","In a certain sense, The Battle Of The Five Armies could very well be to The Hobbit series what The Matrix Revolutions was to The Matrix Trilogy. With a battle occupying the center of the film and the title, chances of there being less story to tell abound. And after viewing the movie, I can understand why critics don't really like it.From a critics' point of view, the movie has all that makes them cringe. It has an overabundance of visual effects in an attempt to recreate the epic battles of Jackson's prior trilogy. It has that clichéd love angle / triangle. It has deaths where every death appears a melodrama in itself. It has more connections to the Lord Of The Rings than you can count, effectively making it as a bridge film rather than a standalone one.But then, I'm not a critic. And so, despite all of the above being true in a way, I still enjoyed the film. Yes the movie has a lot of visual effects and clichéd moments. But courtesy Jackson, the clichés manage to make an impact and the effects still appear spectacular. And this, in an age where CGI has made it notoriously difficult to please audiences is a great achievement. Yes, the deaths appear melodramatic. But having been with the characters since the last two films, they also touch you. Yes there are connections to the decade old Middle-Earth trilogy. But these connections only deepen the impact of every scene by making you realize what lies ahead.Jackson was right when he said this film moves almost like a thriller. The editing is tight, the effects are a spectacle (it would be a shame to watch this first on a laptop / desktop and not on a big screen), and the music almost feels like the culmination of a six-film saga that began a decade ago. Howard Shore masterfully mixes different themes connecting this not only to the previous movies but to the Lord Of The Rings movies as well.It was always my desire to see the first trilogy in theaters, something which I never got to do. With the Hobbit films, I have at least been able to witness Middle-Earth on the big screen. This may very well be Jackson's final foray into Middle-Earth and for this reason alone, if nothing else, it is worth seeing. Now let's hope Warner plans a Lord Of The Rings re-release in 3D.",8,2,5,21 December 2014
WALL·E," A highly entertaining, delightful science-fiction film that should not be dismissed as childish animation
","I had heard about this film since quite a long time. My first thought was that could an 'Animation' film supposedly created for kids work as a science-fiction movie for me ? After realizing the positive reception that this film had garnered, I decided to watch this. It would be a first for me in the sense that this was the first animated feature film that I would be viewing. And now, after having done that, I'm glad that I stepped into the territory of animation. WALL·E is not just a fun-filled animation movie meant for kids. It is at par with any feature film featuring big stars, sets and budgets ever made and is much better than most of them.The story is mainly told through visuals (although quite a bit of dialog creeps in during the last hour) and is best deciphered by the viewers themselves instead of being explained in such a review. It's set about 700-800 years into the future when Earth is in a mess, mankind has settled into space and the only moving thing left on Earth is a robot named WALL·E - this should more than suffice. Although there are no dialogs for a major portion of the film, it is much simpler to understand yet gets more complex as you start analyzing it in detail. This kind of treatment comes across as far more effective (at least for me) than say the one in 2001: A Space Odyssey which relies heavily on visuals leaving almost all of the deciphering to the viewer. As such, WALL·E is as simple or complex as you perceive it to be (although for the most part, it is the former).Despite having a short running time, the film packs in much more than many 2+ hour extravaganzas and credit for this must go to the writing, direction and editing - all absolutely first rate. The screenplay is packed in with twists and turns that rarely do we come across moments where nothing happens on screen. Some people have criticized as the opening minutes of the film boring - WALL·E apparently simply goes about doing his stuff. But according to me, those sequences do exactly what they're meant to do - they not only provide us with a glimpse of the everyday life of WALL·E (which is boring and mundane) but also gives an insight into WALL·E's loneliness as also the fact that he longs for companionship. The editing is flawless and one scene just flows into the next (many scenes spring up a surprise or two as well).Technically the film looks polished and the first twenty minutes will leave you wondering whether you're indeed watching an animation film or a shot live-action one. It's only when the humans enter the picture that you realize that its animation. The lighting in the future earth sequences is so live-action Esq, it makes those sequences all the more appealing. Just looking at the principal characters, you can see that it has taken a lot of effort.The main reason that the film works (for me at least) on such a huge level is (besides the story and treatment) is the main character WALL·E. He is simply put the perfect representation of an endearing, hard-working, polite yet cute robot representing humility and empathy. And his eyes are probably his best feature - they are so expressive that WALL·E doesn't need the mouth, shoulders, or even words to communicate or express the emotions that he goes through - the eyes say it all. In short he is the star of the film.WALL·E works on any and every level you want it to. What then is disappointing about this film ? Not much except that I was really looking forward to the music in the trailers being a part of the film and was heartbroken to find out that it wasn't. Also, the future humans could have been a bit better - they look far too cartoonish especially when compared to the film's look in the earth sequences. I guess I've become used to complaining which is what makes me feel as if something's missing from a movie. On the positive side, I believe this prevents me from rating a movie 10/10 at the drop of a hat. Nevertheless, these complaints do not take away from the fact that WALL·E is, in almost all aspects, a superior film and should not just be dismissed as an animation film meant for kids - it has a good message hidden inside it. And yes, this film has allowed me to open the doors of my mind to a new genre of movies - animated films. For me, Toy Story's next.Score: 8.7/10 (Rounded off to 9/10)",9,5,9,3 January 2010
Toy Story 3," It's time we bowed down to Pixar and stopped slamming their films as Children's flicks
","Pixar, it seems, have seriously become a force to reckon with. It all started with Toy Story in 1995 and since then, they've consecutively delivered masterpieces after another as if to virtually remove all doubt that Toy Story was a fluke (and no, it wasn't one). The next in line is Toy Story 3 which, quite easily, joins the ranks of Pixar's finest movies (though I'm now struggling to recollect which one wasn't).In Toy Story 3, we see that Andy is about to move to college. He has to pack up his toys in the attic, donate them, or trash them (that's the choices he has). While he decides to go to the first option, the toys, through a series of misadventures land up in Sunnyside - a place where they'll have plenty of kids to play with them. But all is not as well as it seems since the kids are far from what Andy was when he played with the toys - they thrash them, mercilessly pound them and mess the toys up - enough to make the toys decide to go home.The best thing about Pixar movies (despite the fact that they're animated movies) has been the characters - something which other movie makers need to learn. Although Toy Story 3 excels in almost every department, the characters are never lost in the background. We still care about the likes of Woody, Buzz and Jessie which is surprising considering that we know they're just pieces of toys. And the voice acting is just incredible. I thought Tom Hanks would have lost his form after all these years and was wondering whether, despite aging 10 years, he'd be able to voice Woody with the same enthusiasm he did back in the previous two Toy Story movies. However, he does a brilliant job at it and so does the rest of the voice cast. It'll make you feel as if the voice recording for the movie was done 10 years ago.Technically, the film features CGI which is amazingly impressive. There are times when you simply forget that this is an animation movie you're watching. In fact, just like in WALL·E, the only times the CGI looks CGI is when humans show up (which is perfectly understandable given that it's incredibly difficult to make human CGI). Watch the opening sequence to get what I say, it alone is enough to convince anyone of the visual superiority of this movie. Cinematography and Editing are also flawless, the movie never slows down and it feels that there's something constantly happening in the movie. Humor is again good - especially the scene in which Buzz turns into Spanish mode. Hilarious !!Just like it's predecessors, the most amazing feat of Toy Story 3 according to me is how it makes you emotional and sad towards it's end. It's a perfect example of directorial triumph. And this happens at a time when the characters in the movie just exchange glances at each other, they don't even speak much in that portion of the movie. It's strange to realize you'd become sad by just looking at toys without they saying anything. Without revealing anything all I can say is that the first thing you're likely to do after watching this movie is go home and check out your old toys. You're surely going to miss them - at least I did.My only gripes with the movie - I'd have loved to see more of Rex, Hamm and Slinky Dog. Rex's lack of confidence is something which came across as wonderfully in the first two movies. That is something that I missed. Also, the humor is less stronger as compared to the first two movies and so are the dialogues. Those are my thoughts. These tiny nitpicks shouldn't deter anyone from watching this movie. And yes, the 3D was simply pointless. I actually wanted to watch the movie in 2D but couldn't since all major movie screens are showing it in 3D. That made it clear that the 3D was more for the purposes of generating revenue than for anything else.And yes, it's time we accepted that these movies are NOT movies for Kids. They can be enjoyed equally by Adults as well - in fact more so. It's high time people stopped slamming these movies as movies for the kids and skipped them. If you're one of them, you're missing out on something really important here - something you'll regret 10 years from now for sure. Watch this Pixar !!!Score: 8.5 / 10",8,1,1,4 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Too bad ... Its over
","Its here. The moment we've all been waiting for and the moment we've been secretly dreading. For believe it or not, the fact is, that there might just not be any more Harry Potter left after this movie. The books are over, and with the latest Harry Potter installment, the movies are over too. And so, with Harry Potter, we've all entered adulthood.First off, the movie was great. With the rave reviews it has been getting, I was of the opinion that most of these might have been given out of sympathy and an emotional attachment to the Potter franchise considering that we bid goodbye to him and his circle of friends with this. But the movie actually deserves all the applause its been getting. What struck me as different about this movie is that it has a constant feeling of movement - a feeling similar to what you get when watching Christopher Nolan's masterpieces like Inception and The Dark Knight. Even in a scene which could otherwise have been a simple dialog taking place between two characters, the background score gives the impression of movement - which in turn gives you the on-the-edge-of-the-seat feeling that you usually crave for in movies. And irrespective of whether you've read the novels or not, you're surely going to enjoy this movie because you are well aware that this is it, it has to end here. Either Harry has to die, or Voldemort will. Or maybe both ??? I'm not going to mention anything about the story lest I inadvertently manage to reveal a spoiler. Suffice it to say, that Harry, Ron and Hermione continue their quest of finding and destroying the Horcruxes and hence attempting to destroy Lord Voldemort and in their quest, are joined by almost every character we can recollect to be on their side since the inception of the Potter universe. For those who ain't read the novels, the plot is still simple to follow since most of the explanation bit has been done in Deathly Hallows - Part 1. For those who have, they've according to me included almost everything they could from the novel. Dumbledore's past has been left out and the sequence of events and the manner in which they take place in the ending slightly altered but apart from that, its like watching the novel come to life.The recent Harry Potter movies have become increasingly dark, not just tonally, but also visually. The visuals are great although the darkness sometimes makes it difficult to see what's going on in the screen. I'd imagine the 3D to have an even worse effect which is why I saw the movie in 2D and apart from the opening logo and the ending sequence, I could not see how the movie could have been better in 3D than without it. The background score is simply excellent - just hear the bits playing during Snape's presence; they're haunting. The performances have come up too and again, although Fiennes as Voldemort gives us a scary act and Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are commendable as the trio, the best performance comes from Alan Rickman portraying Severus Snape. His eyes alone manage to convey a wide range of emotions, in some cases, with the rest of his body standing still. Its sad that he has less scenes in the movie. Just like Severus Snape, Rickman here proves to be the secret star of the show.On the minuses, the movie is incredibly dark. Of course, considering that all the action happens during the night, it should rightfully be so but nevertheless, this makes things happening on screen sometimes, difficult to follow. Also, with the time they had, they could've easily extended the movie by 10 minutes or so and included all of Dumbledore's past. That would have added for some interesting character study from a movie's perspective and it would have ensured inclusion of the whole novel in the movie at just a few extra minutes of screen time's worth - something Potter fans and even non novel readers would not have minded. Besides, they should have shown how some of the characters who get bumped off (yes they do) have died instead of just showing us their dead faces. What is bugging is that they actually were cribbing of time all this time along and this movie being 130 minutes approximately, they could've gotten enough time (in fact all the time they needed) to put in those extra scenes which would have only enhanced the movie.I've been preparing to watch this movie for months (three to be precise). I've been reading up all the novels and watching all the movies again. It is while reading the novels for the first time that I realized what I did miss on in all those years of my childhood. Nevertheless, the last few months feel as if I've been living in an alternate universe myself. And finally, I was able to watch this movie while having read the novel before hand - something which I wasn't able to do all these years. And now, its over. I have a hollow feeling inside me telling me that its all over - the event which I've been mentally preparing myself for 3 months is over. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable experience while it lasted. An of course, who knows, they might re release all the Potter films in 3D later on. Which reminds me, who's stopping us from re-watching and re-reading Potter all over again. For what it is, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is a ride that's fun, scary and filled with a tinge of sadness. As a sort of a bonus, you even get to see scenes from the previous Potter films. A must watch. Long live Harry Potter. Longer live Severus Snape !!!Score: 8.0 / 10",8,0,1,16 July 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars - A Renewed Hope
","I can't believe I've missed this all these years. This has got to be the movie phenomenon of perhaps, the century. From what I gather, almost every avid movie watcher is in some way or the other aware of the existence of something called Star Wars. Today, I took the plunge to experience it first hand courtesy the arrival of The Complete Saga on Blu-Ray.What makes Star Wars powerful ??? Is it the characters ??? Not for me. I believe its the well fleshed out story, which looks like it has been adapted from an extremely detailed novel of sorts. What also worked according to me was the development of the movie's narrative - it just flows smooth as silk with no such points existing in the movie where the director has none of the universe's story to share and has just added fillers. There is never a dull moment in Star Wars - it all moves one sequence after the other and they all connect so wonderfully that you're left mesmerized. The characters and performances in my opinion are not bad but they're not as good as the aforementioned aspects. And I trust that these are only going to get better in the movies to follow now that they've been successfully introduced to the audience.Needless to say, the film is a technical marvel. And any praise of the film's technical prowess has to be incomplete without a mention of the film's visual effects. That Lucas could even dream about filming these ambitious sequences three decades ago is remarkable. There's a behind the scenes documentary which shows the making of some of these sequences. Its a must watch for those wondering over how visual effects were done in the good olé' days. The shots are truly breathtaking and so is the editing - everything's wonderfully put into place. Its hard to believe that the first cut of this movie was considered to be a shoddily edited piece of work.The first time I heard the Star Wars main theme, which in the movie was right at the beginning surrounding the opening crawl, my jaw almost dropped. This is because here was the tune that I had been perhaps hearing since my childhood at innumerable award functions, events, advertisements and other such situations but I never actually bothered to investigate its source. I used to believe that its a tune which must have been specially composed for the Oscars, then recycled into being used elsewhere. The theme can best be described as uplifting - and John Williams, a maestro.Missing out this movie meant missing out on one of the most brilliant movie experiences of all without even being aware of it. No amount of talk related to this movie is enough until you've seen it for yourself. I won't get into plot and cast details here because I'm confident that with the presence of so many reviews out there, these must have been taken care of countless number of times. I just felt that I needed to write out the excitement that has gripped me after watching this film - an excitement and curiosity about what the other films hold in store. Its not a perfect film and its certainly going to have its share of detractors and bashers. But this is one film that should be bashed only after its been given a fair trial. And there's a fairly slim chance that you'd wanna do that once you've seen it. This movie has introduced and involved me into the Star Wars universe. And now, I'm off to The Empire Strikes Back the next week !!! Score: 8.5 / 10",9,1,1,2 February 2012
Fast Five," Not a Five Star title, but definitely Fast
","The producers / distributors / makers (call them what you may) behind this movie have decided to transition The Fast And The Furious Series of movies from a street racing franchise into an action / heist one with car chases at its helm instead of the notorious street races that governed most of the previous movies. Had I not watched any of the past movies, I would have certainly welcomed this move. But after seeing all four of them (in anticipation of this one), I believe that leaving out street racing from this movie was not a pretty good idea - there's just one race in this movie and that too, is a friendly sort of no stakes race. Although I can understand the studio's motives behind doing so, The Fast And The Furious series of films deserve at the least one race per film.Anyways, enough of the complaining already. Coming to the point, which is Fast Five, the movie is surely fast and equally furious. The fourth movie ended with Paul and Mia attempting to bust out Dom from prison with an animated escape shown in the end. The fifth movie begins just at that point with a live action escape sequence replacing the animated one at the end of the previous installment. After a job that goes awry, the trio are then on the run since they're wanted by two factions of people - the crew of a businessman Reyes and the team of a DSS agent Luke Hobbs. After running around for some time, they decide to pull one last job to buy out their freedom with fake passports and start life afresh. But with these two powerful men on their tails, it ain't gonna be that easy.Fast Five is more of an action movie and so, for it to work, there has to be action. And there is - plenty of it. Without spoiling most of it by describing it in detail, I'd say the high points of the movie are the train job at the start that goes awry and sets up the events of the movie, the trio's escape from both teams who get to them simultaneously over rooftops, a fight between Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and of course, the finale which is absolute madness. And perhaps all of the sequences have been shot without any use of CGI which is what makes the action even all the more exciting and brings back memories of the past era of action movies where all sequences were filmed rather than digitally created.The cinematography is top notch as well. Although there are a lot of cuts in action sequences, we still get some long continuous areal views of the action (long meaning lasting around 5 seconds or so) which helps understanding what's going on and where it all fits into the surroundings. This ensures you're with the action. Performances are decent and for a mostly wooden Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Connor, you have a surprisingly flexible Dwayne Johnson playing Luke Hobbs - the new entry in the franchise. His character is exactly what he told it would be in the behind the scenes featurettes - strong, efficient at nabbing criminals and a worthy antagonist to Dominic Toretto and his team mates. I'd definitely want him to return in the next installment. And although this ain't a movie about characters, we get some dialogs which actually help us understand the characters a little better giving us some insight into their lives. Nothing deeply psychological - just a tinge of what's hidden beneath the surface. Nice.On the whole, Fast Five is solid entertainment provided you're willing to suspend your disbelief and forget the laws of physics. But then, we always do suspend our disbelief to some extent in movies - that's what they're for. And none of us really does remember the laws of physics so they're irrelevant for the most part. In which case, the movie comes highly recommended and even more so for an action movie buff. This is the definitive action movie of the year. And do stay for some time for a nice post credits surprise which unlike many meaningless sequences, is a critical post-credits scene that might set up the next installment in the series.Score: 7.0 / 10",7,2,4,8 May 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The perfect Star Wars movie. The perfect action adventure flick. The perfect film.
","It's now an accepted fact that the first Star Wars is regarded as one of the most, or amongst some communities, the most successful movie of all time both in terms of critical acclaim and box office gross. Attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. One can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. However, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the Star Wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. Although I had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, I now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the Star Wars universe.There's little need to get into the plot as it is best experienced by watching the movie directly. To describe it in short though, Darth Vader is desperately after Luke Skywalker and wants to turn him to the dark side. In an attempt to capture him, he plans to use his friends Han Solo and Princess Leia as bait. Meanwhile, Luke, guided by Obi-Wan Kenobe's voice through the mystical Force must travel to Dagobah where he must learn the true ways of a Jedi Knight in order to confront the evil lord Darth Vader.Once again, all the elements that made the original Star Wars a success abound in the sequel. There's a well conceived story put together in place, great writing and editing that makes all the sequences feel connected to each other allowing them all to flow together, there's the original cast giving better performances this time being more aware of their characters, and of course, there's the by now famous Star Wars opening musical piece. Lucas, busy handling his newly established visual effects house and finances, hands over the directorial reins to his trusted professor Irvin Kershner. A professor at the University of Cinema Sciences, the way he handles the epic sequences while at the same time concentrating on expanding and developing the characteristic traits of the main cast gives the film an emotional depth which was sorely lacking in the original movie and which was one of my complaints with that film - the characters there were appeared too flat and devoid of personality as though they were just going through the motions. The presence of some character development this time allows us to connect with them even better which in turn makes the situations in which they get involved in a lot more engaging. Amongst all, the character of Han Solo as a dependable 'scoundrel' is what really stands out; Ford plays him out in a near perfect way which is not only consistent with what Solo was in the first film, but also takes it in a further positive direction. His sequences with Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia are amongst the high points of the movie and are brilliantly played out. We also see Mark Hamill as a now slightly more mature Luke Skywalker as he journeys to Dagobah to learn the ways of a true Jedi from the strangely voiced Yoda. And of course there's the inseparable duo of C-3PO and R2-D2 who are actually forced to stay apart from each other for a major portion of this movie. As much as I can admit to not being able to understand anything R2 says, I have inexplicably grown to like his presence immensely in Star Wars.The film features visual effects and action on a scale that's almost twice as big as its predecessor (the budget only confirms this). Spending $32 million on a movie in 1980 would not have been regarded as a wise decision but thank goodness that Lucas decided to go for it or we might not have been able to witness space battles on such a huge scale. The battle on the ice planet at the start of the movie is brilliantly staged and a behind the scenes documentary sheds some light on how some of these miraculous shots were achieved. What's really great about the action is that unlike the heavily edited action sequences of present films wherein the average shot just lasts for about 2-3 seconds, shots in Star Wars last longer making the action very comprehensible and easy to follow. Its easy to see the strategies being adopted by each side while fighting as opposed to units just being brought down by random shots fired by people / creatures obscured by the miss-mash editing. And the best sequence of the movie comes towards the end in an epic battle between Luke and Darth Vader that literally will send your pulse racing. Even more exciting is the battle's infamous outcome which I shall not reveal.Movies like The Empire Strikes Back come only once in a while. Perhaps, every decade must have only a few of these movies present. Fans would obviously come up with a few nitpicks here and there but as far as my opinion goes, this movie is perfect in every aesthetic and area of film-making I'm ever aware of. Now that this movie has set such high standards for the Star Wars saga, I wonder where the next movies will take me. Suffice it to say, The Empire Strikes Back strikes a positive blow from which recovery is simply not possible. A winner all the way !!! Score: 10 / 10",10,0,0,12 February 2012
Furious 7," As a tribute, it works. As a movie, its only average
","It's an understatement that the films in this franchise are getting crazier and increasingly unrealistic with each successive installment. And Furious 7 takes that to yet unseen levels. But then, realism never really was an expectation here was there ? The earlier films though, were at least grounded in some level to the extent that you could at least believe what you saw if you stretched your imaginations far enough. This one takes believability to, as Roman would say it, a whole new level.Sample this: After the events of the previous installment, Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard is out for revenge against Toretto and his crew. To get to them though, he needs to know where they are. So, he breaks into the DSS' headquarters (which looks completely desolated with only Hobbs and Elena working there) and into Hobbs' computer scanning for information on their whereabouts (which, as we were led to believe from the previous installments, were erased with the crew receiving full pardons). He then begins taking them out one by one starting with Hobbs (who Shaw manages to injure badly so as to land him in a hospital) and followed by Han (which connects the franchise to Tokyo Drift) and then Dom and Mia (who barely manage to escape). In the middle of all this, comes a terrorism plot about a certain 'Mr.Nobody 'who is after a device codenamed 'God's Eye' that can turn any camera into a tracking device of sorts allowing its owner to spy on anyone. A terrorist wants to use it for his personal gains but to do so, he requires the assistance of the device's creator - a hot female hacker named Ramsey who Mr. Nobody wants Dom and his crew to rescue since only she knows where the device is. All of this is of course, carried forward by the franchise's trademark over-the-top and highly unbelievable set of action sequences, fast race cars and even bikini-clad chicks in a scene or two.The series seems to have settled on a formula of sorts with a silly plot governed by cringe-worthy lines of dialog relying on its action to do the talking not to mention the amount of times the term last / final is used in the franchise (One Last Ride, One Last Mission, etc.). While the set-pieces here are good enough, they lack the awesomeness of the ones in Fast Five and Furious 6 (which is gonna be hard to top with a tank and a plane). The final sequence drags on for so long with actors doing nothing but mouthing search and rescue dialogues amidst heavily inter-cut action I stopped caring about the outcomes of the characters themselves. The fight sequences too seem to have seemingly odd camera angles as if the director of photography ran out of angles to shoot from.Why then, have I rated this movie a 6 you wonder. That's because it all does come together to create a decent entertainment package. But more importantly, this is largely due to the tribute to Paul Walker at the end that, unexpectedly, feels so heart-wrenching its surprising. After all, its a Fast & Furious movie; it isn't supposed to be this emotional. But the cast give such a fitting send-off to Walker's character in movie it resonates largely with the real life situation. As for the CGI Paul Walker that some people seem to be cringing about, except for some shots in the end, I honestly couldn't make out which shots used his digital double in the film (I did have some guesses but they turned out wrong).I do believe that a lot of the high praise that the movie is getting has to do with this being Walker's final movie as also to the tribute at the end. Otherwise, its a fairly average action movie with a brainless plot that at times, reminded me of the crazy Bollywood movies that a lot of people criticize. Given the money its making and the fact that this is Universal's most reliable and only huge franchise for now, I won't be surprised if we get one of these every two years for the next decade at the least. Watch it, if nothing else, For Paul !!!",6,3,17,12 April 2015
