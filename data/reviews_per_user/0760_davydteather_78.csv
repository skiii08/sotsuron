The Rock," One of Michael Bay's better films.
","The Rock is a fast paced action movie starring Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris. This movie focuses on an FBI chemical weapons specialist and prisoner who join forces to stop a renegade general from from bombing San Francisco with missiles filled with VX poison gas. And he also is holding people hostage on the Alcatraz prison. Nicolas Cage puts on a fine performance as the young FBI agent assigned to prevent the catastrophe from happening. Sean Connery was absolutely brilliant as the prisoner released to help infiltrate the Alcatraz and help stop the bombs from destroying the city. And hands off to Ed Harris for his role as the rogue general. If you like movies filled with lots of action and explosions, this is the film for you. It is a must see.",10,1,1,8 December 2011
Scarface," Say hello to my little friend!!!
","Scarface is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen. Al Pacino and Brian De Palma are definitely at the top of their game in this movie.This movie focuses on the character Tony Montana played by Al Pacino. It shows him starting off a small time criminal and thief and then going up to the top of the cocaine empire. His life begins to fall apart when he gets to the top. And tensions also rises between him and his best friend.The acting and character development is very well done. Al Paino was so outstanding in his role as Tony Montana. He is one of the best actors in Hollywood to date. Steven Bauer did a great job playing Tony's best friend Manny. To me, he is more like the moral compass of the movie. And hands off to Michelle Pfeiffer for her role as Elvira. In my opinion, she is also the moral compass of this film.The cinematography is very well done as well. All the scenes in this movie are very well shot and very well planned out.This movie is a true masterpiece. The thing that bothered me is that it was nominated for a Golden Raspberry award. For worst director if I remember correctly. I do not think it should have been nominated for a Golden Raspberry award at all. I do not see anything terrible about this movie. This movie shows you what it is like to be in the illegal drug trade. This movie is definitely worth a watch. I was so impressed by this movie.",10,1,4,7 September 2011
Requiem for a Dream," Very intense movie.
","When I first saw this movie, I was blown away. The plot was good, solid, harsh and intense. The movie revolves around four people, three heroin addicts and a woman so self conscious abut her appearance. They try to find there own version of happiness and everything starts going downhill for all of them.The acting was well done, especially Ellen Burstyn. I think she should have gotten a Oscar for her role. However she was nominated for one. Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans were outstanding as the three friends trying to get buy in life.I really liked the quality of the quality of the film. It was very well shot and well directed. But I thought the tone of the movie was just to much for me to stomach. I thought this movie went a little overboard on the drug use. So I do not like it enough to recommend it. It is a good film but I thought this film was to dark for my taste. So I give it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,3 August 2011
Raiders of the Lost Ark," I hate snakes Jock! I hate 'em!
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is easily one of the best action/adventure films released in all of the history of cinema. It is fast paced, has lots of action, lots of humour and has one death-defying cliffhanger after another. The part I thought was very hilarious is when Indiana shoots the swordsman. That made me laugh my head off. I found for this movie to have the rating that it has, it has some bloody scenes, for example, when one of the Nazis get his face melted after the ark gets opened. I was surprised that it actually got that rating. But the scene that really got to me is when Indiana and Satipo get tarantulas on their backs. Every time I watch that, I cringe. Of all the Indiana Jones movies, This is one is my favourite after The Last Crusade.",Null,1,2,13 March 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. phone home.
","I first saw this movie when I was just a little kid, and it is one of my favourite movies. It was directed by one of the best filmmakers in modern cinematic history. Steven Spielberg. The story focuses on an alien who was mistakenly left behind on earth and trying to find a way back home and a boy who befriends him. Two weeks after this came out in theatres, another alien visitation film came out in the theatres. John Carpenter's The Thing. Which did not fare as well in the box as E.T. did. I think the reason E.T. got a better reception than the thing is because the alien in E.T. is sweet, cute and lovable. Whereas the alien in John Carpenter's The Thing is mean and evil. In other words, E.T. shows a very positive view on alien visitations while John Carpenter's The Thing portrays The Thing portrays the exact opposite. Personally, I like either kind. If you like movies where the aliens are portrayed as good, cute, and lovable, I would recommend E.T. If you like movies where the aliens are evil and mean, I would recommend Alien, John Carpenter's The Thing, Independence Day and War Of The Worlds. E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial is a timeless classic.",10,0,1,22 June 2012
Minority Report," Everybody runs.
","I saw this movie for the first time in the movie theatre nine years ago. And it blew me away. This has to be one Spielberg's best films around. This movie also has elements of thriller films like red herrings and who did it.I thought the plot of this movie was outstanding. Set in the future where murderers are stopped before they even commit there crimes. When the chief of precrime himself is accused of a future murder, he is on the run and he is trying to prove his innocence. And he goes through extreme measures to avoid being captured by his former teammates (eg. getting his eyes replaced).The acting was phenomenal. Tom Cruise was just outstanding as the main character. He plays the chief of the program that prevents future murders from happening. Colin Farrell was amazing as the FBI agent assigned to oversee the precrime program.The quality was astounding. It has that gritty and some film noir look to to it. This is definitely one of the best sci-fi/thriller films to come out in years.",10,0,1,7 August 2011
Training Day," You wanna go to jail or you wanna go home?
","'Training Day' is a very awesome movie. This is one of the best cop movies to come out of Hollywood in years. Denzel won an academy award for best actor for his role as Alonzo Harris. And he deserved it. Ethan Hawke was nominated an academy award for best supporting actor for his role as Jake Hoyte but he did not win it. I thought he did an outstanding job. In this movie, Denzel Washingtons role was not his usual good guy roles. He plays a police officer who was once a good cop who now administrates his own brand of justice and is fed up with by the book police procedures. He is more mean than the mean streets he is supposed to be shaking down. This movie has a good plot, top notch acting, the cinematography is well done and it is very well paced. If you are a fan of Denzel Washingtons films, I would recommend Training Day. It is definitely worth a watch and time well spent.",10,0,1,7 July 2011
Se7en," This is one creepy thriller.
","This movie is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. There is a lot of originality here. Although the murders in this film do not occur on screen, the aftermath is very disturbing. I really like the storyline to this film. Two detectives are trying to capture a murderer who kills his victims according to the seven deadly sins, hence the films title. For those not familiar with the seven deadly sins, they are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, lust and gluttony. There is good character development, a lot of suspense, some scary moments and it is very disturbing. If you like films directed by David Fincher, I would recommend Se7en. If you do not like films that are filled with disturbing and grotesque images, I would recommend comedy films. If you get the chance, rent it or buy it. You will not be disappointed. It is definitely worth a watch.",10,0,1,6 July 2011
Wayne's World," If you're gonna spew, spew into this.
","Wayne's World is the best comedy film released in the early 90s. I have watched it so many times, too many to count actually. And it still makes me laugh so hard. Dana Carvey and Mike Myers are an excellent team. They are probably the one of the best comedians around. Every time they are on the screen, they bring joy at every turn. Tia Carrere was so hot as Wayne's love interest. She brings life to every scene that she is in. I also liked Rob Lowe as the con artist trying to put Wayne's and Garth's show on TV and buy them out. His character is the guy you would just love to hate. If you have not seen Wayne's world yet, get off the couch and go buy it or rent it. It is a very fun movie. You will laugh so hard throughout the whole movie.",10,0,0,16 September 2011
The Big Lebowski," Obviously, you're not a golfer.
","The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest movies that has come out in such a long time. Jeff Bridges stars as a loser named by his buddies 'the dude'. Throughout the film, he just swears up a storm, plays bowling with his buddies and drinks white Russians. He goes to the mansion of a millionaire named Larry lebowski because some guys peed on his rug and broke into the wrong Larry lebowskis place. One of my favourite scenes is when the big lebowski in interviewing the dude and then the dude says 'i'm not Mr. lebowski, you're Mr. lebowski, I'm the dude. it's that or duder, your dudeness or el duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing. And hands off to John Goodman as the dudes foul-mouthed buddy. The Big Lebowski is a true guilty pleasure.",10,1,2,22 August 2012
Star Trek," The best Star Trek movie I have seen in years,
","This is a very awesome, superb movie. This movie has really good humour, outstanding cast and a very good plot. It has the characters from the original Star Trek T.V. show and the films containing the original crew. But the cast is different. What sets this film apart from the other films and the original T.V. show is that this film takes place is an alternate time-line and time travel is a big theme in this film. It also has a back story on the characters and how they became who they are, namely James T. Kirk, Spock and Dr. Bones McCoy. You see James T. Kirk as an arrogant, haughty, egotistical, rude, self-centred and womanizing dirt bag and before he became captain of the enterprise. You see Spock from his childhood to his time in Starfleet academy. And hands off to Eric Bana as the main bad guy. I would recommend this movie to any Star Trek fan out there. You will not be disappointed. It is worth a watch and time well spent.",10,7,12,10 July 2011
Fight Club," I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
","Fight club is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood ever. This movie just really blew me away. Upon it's released, it spawned a lot of controversy. On the Rosie O'Donnell Show, she gave away the ending for the movie. How could she do something like that? She spoiled the ending. Luckily I did not see that episode of Rosie O'Donnell. Shame on you Rosie O'Donnell. Just because you did not like the movie, doesn't give you the right to spoil the movie for everybody else. If I directed this movie, I would be very furious with you. All that aside, this movie is not just about the fighting and violence. It is more about the whys of the violence. If you have not seen this movie yet, rent it or buy it from your local video store. This movie is a true masterpiece.",Null,2,4,8 September 2011
Shaun of the Dead," Oh my god. She's so drunk.
","What to say about this movie. Shaun of the Dead is one of the funniest comedies if not one of the funniest movies I have seen in such a long time. What makes this movie different from other films in its genre, is that their are zombies added to the mix. I especially like the way the characters behave when they are trying to figure out how they are going to survive while their home city is infested with zombies. The acting, special effects and make-up is just brilliant. Simon Pegg really knows how to act and he plays his role very well and with a lot of conviction. I like how his character is portrayed as a slacker and a very unreliable person, namely to his girlfriend who dumps him as a result, and gets his but off the couch and tries to save his friends from a zombie apocalypse. Shaun of the Dead is a fun movie.",10,3,7,12 November 2011
Hostel," I get a lot of money for you. And then make you my bitch.
","This movie starts off with three backpackers, two American friends and an Icelandic drifter. They are backpacking across Europe smoking marijuana, getting drunk and going to whore houses. Than thy see a Russian guy who recommends them to a hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia where the girls there are supposedly the best. When they arrive there, they meet to gorgeous young women and they start having sex with them and doing all sorts of things with them. Then eventually bad things start happening and one of there friends is missing. They are trying to find out what is going on. It is not like those situation films where something happens the first ten, fifteen or even twenty minutes and they live up to it. This movie unfolds. In other words, it starts off slow but it gets darker and darker and deeper and deeper and deeper as the film progresses. That is what I like about this movie. It also made me think, does this stuff actually happen in real life? This is Eli Roths best movie to date. His first film Cabin Fever was terrible. However he came a long way with this film. If you want to see a film unfolds as it progresses and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through from beginning to end, I would recommend Hostel. But be warned, this films violence is very explicit and realistic and it might leave disturbing images in your head. Not for the faint of heart.",10,1,3,10 July 2011
Orphan," A huge improvement from Juame Collet-Serra's House of Wax.
","I rented this movie from blockbuster a few months ago, and I enjoyed it a lot. This movie has a lot of chills, thrills, scares and suspense from beginning to end. However,'when I first heard of it,'I thought it was just going to be some cheesy horror film about a child from hell. But after I saw the movie, I had a sudden change of heart.This movie is a bout a couple who lose a child through stillbirth and go through strains in their marriage. Then they adopt a nine year old Russian girls who is very bright for her age. After they adopt her, everything seems to be hunky dory, but then bad things start happening around the little girl. Then the girls adoptive mother tries to find out more about her, but nobody believes her claims.If you want a scary child from hell movie, you got one. It is worth a watch.",10,4,6,31 July 2011
Terminator Salvation," Not as good as the first two films, but it is better than the third one.
","I saw this movie for the first time in the theatre with very high expectations. And I am glad I saw it. This film takes place in the future where skynet is dominating but still in a state of evolution. I thought this film was very well directed, good casting, the acting is top notch, it has a good plot, the pacing is well done and it has a good look to it.There was also the introduction of different terminators that were mentioned in the previous films but not shown in any of them. Sam Worthington did a really good job playing the role of an outsider from named Marcus who is trying to find someone he knew a while back. Anton Yelchin was just amazing as a young Kyle Reese, John Connor's father. And hands off to Christain Bale for his role as John Connor, the leader of the resistance. It is definitely worth a watch and time well spent.",Null,2,7,2 July 2011
The Terminator," Nice night for a walk.
","The Terminator is easily one of the best science fiction films released in the 1980's. Also one of James Cameron's best.This movie really jump-started Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career. He is such an underrated actor. He also did quite well in Predator, Total Recall and Terminator 2. In my opinion, his best film was Terminator 2. He is just a total bad-ass in this film. Unlike Terminator 2 and 3, his character is sent back to kill the mother of the leader of the human resistance. I the first two sequels, he is sent back to protect him from another Terminator sent back to kill him. Michael Beihn was amazing too. He plays his role very well. He really knows how to act. Linda Hamilton did a great job as well. She is one of the best actresses around. The Terminator is a milestone in science fiction.",Null,2,3,15 November 2011
Sleepy Hollow," Head-chopping fun.
","Tim Burton has yet again made another masterpiece in his whole movie making career. It is very beautifully shot, well directed and the acting was top notch. I thought the decapitations in this movie looked so realistic an they are very graphic. Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing in his role as Ichobad Crane. He has such a great charisma and plays his role with such believability. My favourite scene in this film is when the fat guy gets decapitated and his head rolls down into Ichobad Cranes crotch and is then picked up by the horseman and then he faints. After I saw that scene, I just laughed my head off. Sleepy Hollow is a very scary horror masterpiece that is not to be missed.",10,0,0,20 May 2012
Alien," One of the scariest sci-fi/horror movies ever made.
","Alien is a scary science fiction horror film about a group of space miners who stumble on a distress signal coming from an undisclosed planet. They go out to investigate, and find a spaceship, go inside and one of them finds egg shaped objects. After he touches one of them, it opens and something attaches itself to his face. After that, an alien bursts out of his chest and the crew gets killed off one by one. When I saw this movie for the first time, it really scared the hell out of me. It has one of the best utilizations of science fiction and horror. It is not just the creature that is frightening, it is also the atmosphere and the tone of the movie that sends shivers running down your spine. It is also very claustrophobic. Sigourney Weaver is an absolute bad-ass as the main character. Alien is a true classic. It is a must see.",Null,1,3,18 December 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," At last, my arm is complete again.
","Whenever it comes to a movie with a dark subject, Tim Burton really knows how to pull it off. This is probably one of his darkest movies along with sleepy hollow. It has a perfect blend of horror and musical all in one movie. Truth be told, I am not a very huge musical movie fan, but I really enjoyed Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. This time around, he made a very bloody revenge story about a man who is arrested for a crime he did not commit, and plans to get revenge on the people involved with his incarceration. This movie has a lot of scenes with throats being cut by a straight razor and for those who are squeamish, I would recommend you avoid this. But if you like blood and gore, I would recommend this. Sweeney Todd is a bloody good time of a movie.",10,1,2,20 May 2012
Underworld Awakening," Excellent movie.
","This is the best movie in the Underworld series. Kate Beckinsale is back and better than ever. This time around, the existence of the vampire and lycan clans have been discovered by the humans and are targeted for annihilation. I saw it in the movie theatre in 3-D three nights ago and it was just out of this world. So far this is the only underworld film I saw in the theatre. There is so much action, lots of blood and gore. The transformations of the lycans are very beautifully done and well shot and the action scenes are very top notch. It also has very good storytelling. It is also very well crafted, very well directed and very well paced. In fact, the whole Underworld series is very well crafted, directed and well paced. What makes this film series different from other monster movies is that it has vampires and werewolves at war with each other. If you liked the Underworld series, I would recommend this movie. Underworld: Awakening is a very fun monster movie.",10,19,38,29 January 2012
Forrest Gump," A stupid is a stupid does.
","This is one of the most uplifting and moving movies in modern cinematic history. I absolutely loved it. How could you not love this movie. We have Forrest Gump, not the smartest guy on the world, with an I.Q. below average, yet we see the world through his eyes. And he is in many imortant world events, e.g., the Vietnam war, meeting the president and so on and so forth. And he has influenced many people to follow their dreams. I have seen this movie so many times, and it is one of my all time favourites. Easily Tom Hanks' best film role. And Hands off to Gary Sinise for his role as Lieutenant Dan. Forrest Gump is a very fine piece of filmmaking.",10,1,2,26 January 2012
Predator," Stick around.
",Predator is one of my favourite science fiction thrillers of all time. There is a lot of action and a lot of humour. And it also has a lot of heart. Their is also a lot of suspense. I like the fact that you do not see the predator a lot in this movie. That is what makes it more shocking. Arnold was just absolutely brilliant in this movie. His best movie along with Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The visual effects and special effects were very well done. And it is very fast paced. This movie is about a special forces team sent to the jungle to rescue hostages. But instead they have to fight for their own lives. Predator is a good time of a science fiction movie.,10,1,2,18 September 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," If you want him, come and claim him.
","This is one of the best fantasy movies I have seen in such a long time. One of the best epics since Star Wars. The cinematography is top notch, the acting is way beyond par, and the CGI is just so out of this world. It has everything a fantasy movie is supposed to have, mythic monsters, elves, dwarfs and wizards. What more could you possibly want. The battle scenes and the sword fights are very well choreographed. How can anybody not like this movie. It has a lot of heart and soul. Easily the best movie of 2001. If you have not seen it yet, get off your couch and go to your local video store and rent it or buy it. Or if you have a computer, download it or watch it on netflix. You do not want to miss out on this flick. It is a true masterpiece.",Null,0,0,23 January 2012
The Thing," An awesome science fiction/horror movie.
","John Carpenter's The Thing is a very scary science fiction/horror movie with lots of suspense throughout. This is classic John Carpenter. He knows how to send chills and shivers down your spine. This movie focuses on a group of scientists stationed in an outpost on Antarctica who encounter an alien life form that consumes and replicates other lifeforms. When the group discovers this, they begin to think that one of them might be infected and they do not know which one. That is what makes this movie very shocking, you do not know who is or is not infected by the alien, and neither do the characters. In other words, their is a lot of suspense and their is a sense of paranoia. And it was such a very big shame it got nominated for a golden raspberry award for worst musical score. I really liked it and I personally think it is very good and very well done. The music is very dark and ominous. And fits very well with the atmosphere of this movie. John Carpenter's The Thing is a true guilty pleasure.",10,1,2,13 January 2012
The Village," One of M. Night Shyamalan's better films.
","I saw this movie with the expectation that it was going to be so boring, depressing, atrociously slow paced, poorly acted and downright deplorable. It is a little slow paced and a little scary in some scenes, but the acting was executed just brilliantly. Joaquin Phoenix really came a long way in this movie unlike in signs, which was absolutely horrible. He did a decent job in that movie. But I felt he did a better job in this movie. I felt this movie could have been a little more scary and a little more faster paced. The ending was a bit of a disappointment. You find out it is set in the modern time and not in the time of the 18th or 19th century. I give The Village a 6 out 10. Like I said, it could have been more scary, faster paced and not set in the modern time. It is not a great movie, but it does have some good moments. It is much better than Signs and The Sixth Sense.",6,1,2,30 November 2011
Pitch Black," Just don't run.
","So many sci/fi films that pit human beings against dangerous and monstrous extraterrestrial beings are a rip off of films like alien. But not Pitch Black. This movie stands as one of the most original sci/fi films. This movie is about a group of people being en route to an undisclosed location along with a dangerous criminal named Riddick who is being sent to a slam. And then their ship gets hit by a meteor shower and crashes on a desert planet. When Riddick gets out, the crew fears for their lives. But when a member of the crew gets killed by a mysterious creature, they blame Riddick. But eventually, they find something more dangerous than him. They must ban together with Riddick in order to stay alive. Pitch Black is a wonderful peace of science fiction. Definitely on my list of most liked films.",10,0,1,9 September 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not as good as the other Terminator movies.
","I am surprised this movie is getting all the negative reviews it is getting. I do not know why so many people do not like this movie. This is actually a fairly decent movie. Although I thought it went a little overboard on the humour. True some of the phrases in the other films were not said in the exact same way as they were in this one, but I still think it is quite enjoyable. It has lots of action and it is well paced. Arnold Schwarzenegger was just amazing in his role as the terminator. He again plays the protector of the leader of the resistance, John Connor. Just like he did in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. And the idea of the other terminator being a woman was something quite original. Although I thought the villain in Terminator 2 was better. Terminator 3 is definitely worth a watch.",Null,0,0,15 November 2011
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best action movie of all time. It is also the best sequel movie of all time.
","This movie is one of James Cameron's best to date. It is also Arnold Schwarzenegger's best. I liked this movie better than the first Terminator film, but I thought the first film was good though. This movie has awesome special effects and visual effects, top notch acting and a very good storyline. In this film, the Terminator is sent back to protect John Connor and Sarah Connor from a more advanced more powerful terminator, the T-1000. I liked Robert Patrick's portrayal as the T-1000 in this movie. This is Robert Patrick's best film role to date so far. Sarah Connor is more psycho and more stronger in this film than she was in the first one. Like I said, I think this film is better than the first one. This movie is the breakthrough movie with the use of CG. Creating the first computer animated villain and a partially computer animated main character. This movie is definitely worth a watch and time well spent.",Null,5,6,30 June 2011
Face_Off," One of John Woos Best films to date.
","When I first heard of this movie, I was so excited to see it. And I am glad that I did. This movie has a good storyline, good character development, good acting, it is very fast paced and it has really good action sequences. This movie stars Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. In this movie the protagonist and the antagonist switch faces through a type of plastic surgery. John Travolta did a good job playing the main character who undergoes the surgery to have his face swapped with the bad guys face. He did especially well when he played the bad guy wearing the good guys face. Nicolas Cage did very well playing the bad guy who had his face removed through the surgery. And then he gets the surgeon who performed the surgery to plant the good guys face onto his. He especially did well playing the good guy wearing the bad guys face. The thing I like the most about this movie is the role reversals between the John Travolta character and the Nicolas Cage Character. Hands off to John Woo for a job well done. Congratulations Mr. Woo.",Null,0,0,22 June 2011
Aliens," I like to keep this handy, for close encounters.
","Aliens is the fast paced, action packed sequel to the 1979 smash hit movie Alien. This movie has it all, great action, beautiful cinematography, big guns, great characters and more monsters. This time around, Ripley from the first movie is awakened 57 years after the events in alien from hyper-sleep and the planet where the creature that killed her crew was found is now colonized. And she is sent back to that planet with a team of marines and a representative with the company she works for to investigate what is happening after communication is lost with the colony on the planet. And Ripley comes face-to-face with the very same monsters that killed her crew in the first movie. James Cameron takes elements that were in the first movie and adds some of his own to this one. Of all the films in the Alien series, Ridley Scott's movie and James Cameron's movie are by far the best. Aliens is one of the best sci fi/action movies ever made.",Null,0,1,27 December 2011
American History X," A very powerful movie..
","I first saw this movie seven months ago and it blew me away. This movie deals with the morality and immorality of human nature. It shows how human beings can be towards one another. This movie makes a statement against racism and it's consequences.This is not a movie for the faint of heart. It is not a fairy tale. It is a story about racism and the effects it can leave on people. The results are hatred, violence, rage, rape and sometimes murder. The reason some people are racist is because they were either brought up that way, influenced by other people who are racist or because they think people of other races are less superior than their own.This is one of the most powerful films that has been released by Hollywood in such a long time. This film might be shocking and disturbing, but it does send a very powerful message.",10,0,1,29 July 2011
Pearl Harbor," Michael Bay's worst movie.
","This movie is as terrible as you have heard. It is bloated, overblown and tediously overlong. It is very slow paced, the performances are absolutely deplorable and laughable. And it is an absolute bore. The only good sequence in this movie is when the Japanese are bombing Pearl harbor. The visual effects were outstanding, but that does not make up for the awful performances. Michael Bay should have done his research on the events around the time Pearl Harbor was bombed. Reason being, if he did that research, the movie might have been much better than it actually is. On the whole, this movie is just a downright atrocity. Do not bother with this movie. It is just a waste of your time and money.",1,2,3,25 October 2011
Independence Day," Now that's what I call a close encounter.
","Independence Day has to be one of the best alien invasion movies released in the last quarter century. True the storyline is not very original, it does borrow themes from other sci-fi movies. The thing that is original is that the time line of this movie is between July 2 and July 4. But this movie has marvellous special effects, lots of action and lots of heart. I can not believe it was even nominated for a golden raspberry award. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I do not think it should have been nominated for that award. This movie has excellent performances from Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum. Independence Day was also the top grossing movie of 1996. If you have not seen this movie, watch it right away. It will blow you away.",10,5,10,21 August 2011
District 9," A lot better than I thought it was going to be.
","District 9 is a no-hold-barred violent, bloody, gory and disturbing science fiction movie. I went into the cinema thinking it was going to be so boring, dower and depressing.But after I saw it, I was just completely blown away. The pacing was well done, the acting was phenomenal and the cinematography was top notch. I really like the way the film is shot in a documentary-like style. That is what makes this movie different from other science fiction and alien movies that have been released before this one. One of the best science fiction films ever released. This movie goes right for the throat. If you are a big fan of science fiction movies, I recommend District 9. It is worth a watch.",10,0,4,15 November 2011
Batman Begins," Awesome!!!
","This Batman movie blew me away. When I first heard of it, I thought it was going to be a prequel to the other Batman films. But it isn't a prequel, it is a reboot to the Batman series.I really liked the plot to this movie. In this movie, you get shown the back story of why Batman became who he is and and how. You are shown how he got his martial arts skills and why he chose bats as an idea for his suit.The acting in this movie was superb. Christain Bale was an excellent actor for the role of Batman. And I would have to say the best. It is amazing he can do so much with so little. Liam Neeson was awesome as the main villain. He has such an amazing charisma. Gary Oldman was outstanding as Gordon. He is such an amazing actor. And finally hands off to Michael Caine for his role as Alfred Pennyworth, Batmans butler and surrogate father.This movie has a very good look to it. It is very well shot, well lit and the cinematography is well done. Much better than the original Batman films.",Null,0,2,6 August 2011
Twilight," What is all the negativity about.
","I do not understand why this movie is getting all the negative criticism that it is getting. It is actually a very awesome movie. Sure it is not your traditional vampire movie. True the vampires do not burn to a crisp when sunlight hits them in this movie. And yes, there is also a love story element added to the mix. But hey, that is what makes this movie different from other vampire movies. It has some originality to it. In most vampire films, their is usually no love story element added to it, and the vampires get burned to a crisp when hit by sunlight or ultraviolet produced by some mechanical devices. And they are usually if not always very gory. But not this movie. There is a little bit of blood in this movie. But not the amount that a traditional vampire movie has. But nevertheless, it is very good. Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson were absolutely amazing. This movie is a must see.",10,3,10,21 November 2011
Saving Private Ryan," The best war movie of all time.
","Saving Private Ryan is a very fast paced war movie with lots battle scenes throughout. One of the best war movie ever released in modern cinematic history. This is Spielberg's best film along with Minority Report, Jurassic Park, Jaws and Schindler's List. The look of it is phenomenal, and th acting is very well done. Tom Hanks is really at the top of his game in this epic. His best performance since his role in the movie Forrest Gump. And every scene is shot with very well shot and the filmmakers payed very close attention to detail. Although the movie is not historically accurate, it does give you some insight on how brutal World War II was. If you have not seen this movie yet, rent it or buy it right away. Saving Private Ryan is a true masterpiece..",Null,1,2,31 October 2011
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Another great movie from Steven Spielberg.
","When I saw this movie, it had all the things it promised to have. Lots of dinosaurs and lots of action. I didn't like it as much as the first movie but I liked it better than the third movie. But on the whole, they are all good movies. I liked the introduction of other dinosaurs that were not in the first movie. In this movie, the dinosaurs look so real, just like in the first and third movies. In this film,Ian Malcolm is the lead character and you know more about him, unlike in the first film he is more of a flat character, but you still care about him. He was also more of a cynic. He is still a bit of a cynic in this film but not as much as he was in the first film. This movie has an awesome storyline, a cast of top notch actors and it is very well paced. A must see.",10,4,7,12 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," There's only one way to eat a brace of conies.
","Rarely is a sequel better than the original. But for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, that is definitely the case. It surpasses the Fellowship of the Ring in every way. More elaborate battle sequences, and more mythic monsters. But I am not in any way saying The Fellowship of the Ring was not a fun movie, because it is, I just think The Two Towers is a little better. It is more action packed and some characters that are seen briefly in the first movie now have a bigger role in this one. The character of gollum was an amazing addition to the series. And the actor who played him really was just outstanding. He gives the character a very good sense of realness and believability. The best movie of 2002. This movie is also not one to be missed.",Null,0,1,23 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," What is all the fuss about?
","I do not understand why a lot of people are saying negative things about this movie. This is actually a very good movie. It thought New Moon was a little better than Twilight. In this movie, their are werewolves and vampires. What more could you ask for. The cinematography and directing is well done, it is well paced, their is more action, and it goes more in depth with the characters than the first movie did. Everything a sequel is supposed to do. I really hate the reviews that are putting this movie down. The acting was also very well done. Especially Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner. It is worth a watch.",10,2,7,2 December 2011
Transformers," Autobots! Roll out!
","Michael Bay has made some very enjoyable movies, including this one, and a couple bad ones. Transformers is one of his better films. He has put in a great mix of visual effects, special effects, and action. This movie also has a lot of humour, but not not enough for it to be a comedy. It has one of the best uses of CGI, visual effects and special effects along with Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Matrix and Jurassic Park. The acting was absolutely astonishing. Shia Labeouf was just brilliant for playing the lead character Sam Witwicky . And hands off to Megan Fox for playing Mikayla, Sam Witwicky's love interest. The fight scenes and battle scenes were shot very beautifully. I recommend this movie to anybody who are fans of the TV shows and the action figures.",10,4,5,25 November 2011
Event Horizon," A great combination of science fiction and horror all in one movie.
","This is without a doubt one of the best science fiction/horror films i have ever seen. There is a lot of good character development, good acting, the pacing is very well done and there are a lot of good thrills and chills throughout. This is a very underrated movie and deserves more praise than it already has. This movie pays homage to some of the older science fiction and horror films from the past, including the Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Haunting and Hellraiser. This movie has a very dark atmosphere and feel to it. I saw it for the first time when it came out, and it scared the hell out of me. Paul Anderson did a really good job setting the tone for this film and he did really well with the direction. Laurence Fishburne did a good job playing the captain of the search and rescue team. And hands off to Sam Neill for his portrayal as the guy who built the ship. If you have not seen this movie yet, go rent it or buy it from your local video store. You will not be disappointed. It is definitely worth a watch.",10,1,3,22 June 2011
From Dusk Till Dawn," A decent monster movie.
","From Dusk Till Dawn is not my favourite vampire movie, but it is a very decent movie. There is gore. Their is profanity. And their is violence The acting and direction in this movie are well done. But the only bummer is, that the special effects are not the greatest. George Clooney is very bad-ass as the anti-hero Seth Gecko. This was a good career choice for him. Unlike his role in the movie Batman and Robin, which was absolute trash. Quentin Tarantino played his role of Richie Gecko quite well also. He is more frightening than Seth Gecko. Seth Gecko may be ruthless, but he more or less of the moral compass of this movie. Not the best vampire movie out there, but it is worth a watch.",Null,0,0,18 September 2011
Jerry Maguire," Show me the money!!!
","Jerry Maguire is one of Tom Cruises best films to date. Tom Cruise plays Jerry Maguire, a sports agent who writes a mission statement that ends up costing his job and then he starts his own company. Ithought their was a little too much going on in this movie. Namely the relationship between Jerry and Dorothy Boyd. But I still enjoyed it. Tom Cruise was amazing as the lead character who starts out as a egotistical sports agent and then he becomes more compassionate as the film goes on. Cuba Gooding, Jr. was amazing as Rod Tidwell, a football player and Jerry Maguires client. And finally to Renee Zellweger as Dorothy Boyd, Jerry Maguires love interest. This is a very fun movie.",9,0,0,23 January 2012
The Dark Knight," Why so serious?
","I dedicate this movie review to the late Heath Ledger. This is the best entry out of all the Batman films. The next best Batman film being Batman Begins.I thought the actors in this movie were outstanding. The two actors who did the best job are the late Heath Ledger and Christain Bale. Christain did a better job as Batman in this movie. But I thought he did very well in Batman Begins. In this movie, he has better and more high-tech weaponry and a new vehicle. Heath Ledger was astonishing as the Joker. The Joker is more evil, frightening and psychotic in this movie than in the original.The quality of this movie is just as good as Batman Begins.This is a tribute to Heath Ledger. You did a good job on your role as the bad guy. You deserved your academy award that you won. It is too bad you are not here to read the review I am writing.Rest In Peace.",Null,0,2,6 August 2011
Blood Diamond," Long sleeve or short sleeve?
","Blood Diamond is a fast paced action/drama film that gives you insight where many of the diamonds sold in jewelry are coming from. It focuses on an African fisherman, a mercenary/smuggler and a syndicate of business men trying to match wits over the possession a priceless diamond from a small African country torn by civil war. These diamonds exported from those places are called conflict diamonds or blood diamonds. Leonardo DiCaprio is at the top of his game in this movie. Definitely one of his best roles since titanic. One of the most powerful movies ever made. And last but not least, hands off to Djimon Hounsou. He played his role with outstanding conviction and a lot of heart. One more thing. If you decide to buy diamond jewelry or anything made from diamonds, make sure you ask the clerk, the manager or the jewelry store owner for information about those diamonds.",10,2,2,28 September 2011
Avatar," James Cameron's best film since Terminator 2: Judgment Day.
","Avatar blew me away when I saw it in the movie theatre. It has outstanding CGI, visual effects, special effects, a good story, good plot, great acting, the pacing is well done and the cinematography is top notch. One of the best visual and special effects and CGI since Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Jutassic Park and The Matrix. It also has some originality to it. I really liked Sam Worthington's performance as the paraplegic marine who replaces his deceased brother. He is absolutely amazing. Same for Sigourney Weaver. Her performance was also amazing. If you have not seen this movie yet, I recommend you watch it right away. It is a must see.",10,1,5,29 August 2011
Saw," I want to play a game.
",Saw is the best serial killer movie I have ever seen. This movie is on par with se7en as being one of the most disturbing movies ever made. The look of it is just outstanding.The thing that makes this movie different from other serial killer movies is that the killer puts his victims in situations where they have to fight for their lives and try to survive their traps or 'games' as the killer calls them or die trying. The killer wants the people to succeed and appreciate their lives.The acting was top notch. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell were just excellent together. And hands off to Danny Glover. He brings life to every scene he is in. He is just amazing.Every shot in this movie was made with a lot of planning. Unlike battlefield earth which was a complete mess. This movie is an amazing piece of filmmaking.,Null,1,3,8 September 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Quentin Tarantinos directorial debut.
","Reservoir Dogs is the first movie directed by writer/director Quentin Tarantino. This film focuses on a group of criminals holing up in an abandoned warehouse after a robbery goes wrong.And they find out one of their own is an undercover police officer, but which one? What makes this film different than other heist films is that this films takes place before and after the heist. But it does not show the heist. It is mentioned in dialogue. I also like the non-linear narrative this film has. My favourite scene in this film is when Mr. Blonde is torturing the Police Officer. And then he cuts his ear off. If you like movies that let you use your imagination, I would recommend Reservoir Dogs. One of the best heist films ever made. It is a must see.",10,0,0,21 July 2011
Total Recall," See you at the party, Richter!
","Total Recall is a fast paced sci-fi action movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way from beginning to end. For a movie released in the early 1990's, it has some very spectacular make-up effects, visual effects and special effects. This movie is sort of similar to Paul Verhoeven's other films. It is violent, bloody, it has some sexuality/nudity and some profanity. This movie has dark humour. Paul Verhoeven really knows how to use visual and special effects and dark humour whenever he is shooting a scene in his movies. This is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films, along with Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Predator. Total Recall is also one Verhoeven's best movies to date. This movie is worth a watch.",Null,30,36,6 November 2011
Pulp Fiction," Quentin Tarantinos best.
","This is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in so many years. I really like the fact that this film is told in a non-linear story structure. The thing about non-linear narratives is that they are sometimes hard to follow. So you have to pay more attention to them than you would for a film that has a linear story structure. This is the second film by writer/director Quentin Tarantino. The first being Reservoir Dogs. This movie pays homage to some older films from the past including deliverance and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Although this movie has drug dealers, gangsters and thugs, they are portrayed as good people. If you want to see a good crime movie, watch Pulp Fiction. It is worth a watch and time well spent.",10,0,2,21 July 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A good sequel to Transformers
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the fast paced sequel to the 2007 summer blockbuster movie Transformers. This time round, their is more action, more robots, more fight scenes and more explosions. Everything a sequel is supposed to be. They are supposed to be more action packed and each action scene is more elaborate. In this movie, Sam Witwicky is sent to college and the autobots are fighting with the military to fight off the decepticons that are scattered all over the globe. The cinematography and action scenes were very well shot and planned out. And the acting was superb. If you liked the first movie and the television shows, you will very likely like this movie. It is not as good as the first movie or the third, but is still quite enjoyable. It is worth a watch.",10,4,6,27 November 2011
War of the Worlds," Superb.
","War of the Worlds is a fast paced sci-fi movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way from beginning to end. Steven Spielberg yet again made another triumph in his cinematic career as director. Alongwith Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Minority Report, Saving Private Ryan and Jaws, this is one of his most well made films. Tom Cruise put forth an amazing performance as the father trying to protect his two kids from an alien invasion. One of his best roles along with his role as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible and as the title character in the movie Jerry Maguire. He is one of the best movie stars around. It is such a shame that he was nominated a golden raspberry award for worst actor. And Dakota Fanning also put forth an amazing performance. Warning, this movie has some frightening moments. So it probably might not be viewed by little children since they might most likely be scared. War of the Worlds is a very fine piece of filmmaking.",10,3,5,8 December 2011
Man on Fire," An awesome movie.
","Man on fire is a movie that shows you what happens to people in the bad parts of Latin American countries. In Latin America, namely Mexico, out of all the people who are kidnapped, 70% of the victims do not survive. And when or if they are released from captivity, they usually get a part of their body missing, like an ear for instance. This movie focuses on a man who is hired by a rich family in Mexico to be the bodyguard of their young daughter. But when she gets kidnapped, he goes on a mission to kill everybody who was involved in the kidnapping and try to find her alive and bring her back to her family. The most compelling thing about this movie is the fact that most of the kidnapping victims end up dead. I was completely blown away.",10,4,6,14 September 2011
The Green Mile," What happens on the mile, stays on the mile.
","Tom Hanks puts forward another great performance in his acting career. One of his greatest performances since Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan. In this movie, he plays the head prison guard of a death row prison, or the green mile or the mile as the guards call it. It also features the second collaboration with Tom Hanks and Barry Pepper, who is also a pretty good actor. But he did a very terrible job in Battlefield Earth. And the roll of John Coffey played by Michael Clarke Duncan was absolutely amazing, remarkable, breathtaking and very touching. He plays a death row inmate accused of murdering two little girls which he did not do who and he is also very huge and strong and has the mentality of a child. He is basically the guy you would feel sympathy, empathy and compassion for. This is Michael Clarke Duncan's best film role to date. Doug Hutchinson was awesome as Percy, the guard who has no respect and no compassion for the prisoners. He is pretty much the guy who thinks, who cares about the prisoners and has little respect for his colleagues. He is also the guy you would just love to hate. And finally, hands off to James Cromwell as the prison warden. One of his best film performances. The Green Mile is one of the most touching and most gripping movies I have ever seen. Along with the Shawshank Redemption, this is one of the best prison movies ever made.",10,1,2,9 December 2011
Jaws," You're gonna need a bigger boat.
","Jaws has to be one of the best films released in the 1970's. It is scary, suspenseful and funny. The thing I like about this movie is the fact that the shark is not shown for most of the film. When the shark is shown, for most of the film you only see the dorsal fin and tail fin. That is what makes this film so good. The musical score was excellent. Hearing that music when the shark is about to attack always sent chills down my spine. That is what makes a good horror film. When I saw the shark full frontal, I was like, oh my god, this is very creepy. Robert Shaw was phenomenal as the crude fisherman quint. It made me sad when he died a horrible, painful bloody death. I especially like the line 'Your gonna need a bigger boat'. That just cracks me up. If you like killer shark movies, I recommend Jaws. This movie is a true masterpiece.",10,1,2,21 August 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Get busy living, or get busy dying.
","Of all the prison movies I have ever seen, The Shawshank Redemption is easily the best of them all. And of all the movies based on Stephen King's novels and novellas, this is the best adaptation. It was a shame it did not win any of the Oscars it was nominated for. I think it is one of the best movies to be made in so many years in cinematic history. It gives you insight on what life would be like if you were in prison. This movie focuses on a man sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, which he did not commit. Tim Robbins is one of the most talented actors around. He plays his role with a lot of heart, soul and conviction. His best film role to date. Morgan Freeman is also very talented, he also played his role with a lot of heart, soul and and conviction. This is also his best film role to date. And finally hands off to Bill Gunton for his role as the wicked prison warden. His character is an absolute bad ass. The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece.",10,0,0,13 January 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Anthony Hopkins is god.
","The Silence of the Lambs is easily one of the scariest thrillers to ever come out of Hollywood. And one of the most disturbing films too. It introduced on of the most iconic movie villains in cinematic history, Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. This is easily his best film role to date. Every time I see Anthony Hopkins in other movies, I automatically think of Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter. Jodie Foster was just outstanding for her role as the young FBI trainee assigned to ask Lecter for help tracking down another serial killer. Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are a very good team. They play their roles with outstanding convicting and believability. And hands off to Ted Levine for his role as Jame Gumb, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill. He also played his role with outstanding conviction. This movie is not for the squeamish. And it will send chills down your spine. If you like thrillers that are disturbing and scary, I recommend The Silence of the Lambs. This movie is a very fine piece of filmmaking.",10,1,2,22 November 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Yes. The fire rises

This time around, Gotham is threatened by a terrorist, named Bane who plans to destroy gotham and all it's people fulfilling the destiny of ra's al ghul who tried to destroy gotham in batman begins. It has awesome special effects, an a class list of top notch actors and awesome battle scenes. Great performances by Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle respectively. They have great chemistry. And hands off to Tom Hardy as Bane. He pulled off that role so well. He played that role with great believability and conviction. Tom Hardy's portrayal of bane was so much better than the portrayal of bane in Batman and Robin. The Dark Knight Rises is a fun roller-coaster ride of a superhero movie.",10,7,15,12 August 2012
Signs," What a total waste of time!
","This has to be one of the stupidest movies I have seen in a long time. Who in their right mind would make a film like this. Aliens come to earth and form crop circles in peoples cornfields all over the globe. And they also come to harvest humans. And they can not even handle water. The plot was stupid, the acting was deplorable and the pacing was just downright atrocious. However, I did like the scene where Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix were running around the house cursing up a storm. That scene made me laugh my head off. But the rest of the film was very despicable. This movie has no respect for science fiction and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. M. Night Shyamalan has to be one of the worst and one of the dumbest filmmakers in history. All the films he has made are so boring and slow paced they make me yawn and think yeah whatever who cares. I despise this film so much that I just want to tell the director off and give him a black eye and a broken nose. Do not bother with this film, it will just be a waste of your time and money. That is how despicable and deplorable this film is.",1,9,18,13 July 2011
The Sixth Sense," What a very despicable movie.
","When this film was released, I thought it was going to be scary and a lot of fun. But after I saw it, I thought to myself, what was M. Night Shyamalan thinking? This movie is slow paced, has bad acting, it is boring, not suspenseful, not scary, a waste of time and downright despicable. Watching this movie is like watching your laundry tumble in the dryer for two hours. That is how much I despise this film and that is how boring and slow paced it is. However I have to give kudos off to Bruce Willis for his role in this film. I thought he was the only actor who did very well in this film. If you want to see a really scary movie, I would recommend Event Horizon or The Hills Have Eyes.",1,0,7,27 May 2011
Final Destination," One of the best horror films ever made.
","Final Destination is by far without a doubt one of the most original and most fresh horror movies that has ever been released in modern history. James Wong is an awesome horror film director.The plot was just amazing. A group of High School french class students who are going on a trip to Paris get off a plane after one of the students has a vision that the plane is going to explode. After that event, they all start getting killed off in weird accident one at a time.The acting was outstanding. Especially Tony Todd (also known for his role in the movie candyman) as the guy who has knowledge about death. He can be so intimidating. He was so perfect for his role in this movie. He even has the right voice for it. He is just an amazing actor. Also great performances from Devon Sawa and Ali Larter. They bring life to the screen in every scene they are in.This is an awesome horror movie. I was so impressed after I finished watching it.",10,2,3,9 September 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," That still only counts as one.
","Peter Jackson truly outdid himself with this instalment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is the best of all three. Better than the first two combined. The battle sequences and the action in this movie surpasses the action and battle sequences in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. And you finally see why Frodo Baggins decided to go on the journey that he did and see Gollums decent into madness from the 'one ring'. After I saw this movie, I was so overjoyed and it just blew me away and it kept my full attention all the way from beginning to end. I do not think any other fantasy movie can measure up to Return of the King. The first two films almost measure up to this one. Return of the King is a true Masterpiece",Null,2,4,23 January 2012
A Night at the Roxbury," I broke the window again.
","When I saw this movie, I was laughing my head off. Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan are just the best. Two club-hopping brothers who don't like to do anything other than hitting on girls and go from one night club to the next. What really made me laugh my head off is when they are bobbing there heads to the song 'What Is Love'. The scene in the roxbury was just amazing. The reason these guys are so lovable is because they are so stupid and they are big losers. And they always get rejected by girls because of the way they make advances. I have watched this movie so many times and I still laugh my head off. Actually I am rolling on the floor laughing. If you want a really funny movie, I would recommend this. It will make you laugh so hard you will have a hard time breathing. That is how funny it is. You will not be disappointed. It is a must see.",10,0,1,10 July 2011
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Come to Freddy.
","What to say about A Nightmare On Elm Street. One of the Scariest horror films of all time. One of the scariest films from the 80's. It also introduced one of the greatest and most memorable villains in modern cinematic history. Freddy Krueger. The guy who kills people inn their dreams. This movie really has what it is supposed to have. A lot of scares and a lot of gore. Robert Englund has really made a name for himself after the release of this movie. This is his best film role to date. His next best film role is as one of the college professors in the movie Urban Legend. If you like horror, I would recommend a Nightmare On Elm Street.",10,1,2,1 November 2011
The Matrix," I know kung fu.
","Intriguing, mind-blowing and a flat out fun movie. The Matrix has one of the best uses of CGI, visual effects, special effects and slow motion sequences I have ever seen in a movie. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Ann Moss are definitely at the top of their game in this CGI and visual effects spectacle. Hugo Weaving was absolutely brilliant in his role as the lead agent. He has such a great charisma, face, and voice. All of them make his character so vicious and intimidating. He is just an amazing actor. Keanu Reeves role in this movie is by far the best since his role in the movie Speed. The story is told brilliantly. Another thing that makes this movie so brilliant is the martial arts sequences. This movie will blow your mind.",10,1,2,17 September 2011
Casino," The town will never be the same. Today it looks like Disneyland.
","Casino is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen. I like this film slightly better than Goodfellas but i like that film too. The thing I like about this movie is that it shows you how Las Vegas came to be and is no longer. This movie has an excellent cast of top-list actors including Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Robert De Niro did an outstanding job portraying the main character Sam 'Ace' Rothstein. He was based on a real person named Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal who was a sports handicapper and who also ran a casino in Las Vegas for the mob. Joe Pesci was just amazing as Nick 'Nicky' Santoro, Sam Rothsteins friend. I also liked Sharon Stones performance as Ginger, Sam Rothsteins wife. Although the film was nearly 3 hours long, I thought it was very well done, the cinematography was excellent, the acting was top notch, and it was very well paced. It is a must-see.",10,2,3,2 June 2011
Heat," Look I had to get it on man, he was making a move. I had to get it on.
","Heat is easily without a doubt one of the best crime thrillers ever released. It is also Michael Mann's best films. Director Michael Mann is really at the top of his game. You also got Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, two of the best actors around, in a film together for the first time. What more could you ask for? Especially Al Pacino for his role as the police officer who is having strains in his marriage because of his job. And Robert De Niro as the career criminal who is trying to get out of the life. Every actor in this movie, including the supporting roles, were very well played out Every scene is very well shot and planned out. Heat is a very fun thriller that will keep you absorbed from beginning to end. It is a must see.",10,0,1,18 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," May the force be with you.
","Star Wars is one of the best films ever to be released in modern cinematic history. Definitely one of the best movies from the 1970's. It has good use of CGI, special effects and visual effects. They actually look very good for a movie released in the 70's. When this movie came out, it was a box office hit. And to this day, it is getting more and more popular. It definitely had a huge impact on modern cinema. This movie has a lot of heart and soul. The acting was just out of this world. Harrison Ford was awesome as Han Solo. James Earl Jones did an amazing job doing the voice of Darth Vader. While David Prowse did a great job doing Darth Vaders physical movements. Darth Vader is one of the best movie villains of all time. Star Wars is a true masterpiece.",Null,1,1,4 October 2011
The Thin Red Line," An awesome movie.
","The Thin Red Line is one of the best war movies to be released by Hollywood, along with Saving Private Ryan. This is a very underrated movie and is not easy to understand at times. Most people dismissed this movie as just the other WWII movie of 1998. But this is actually different kind of film. Saving Private Ryan portrayed the Second World War in a very realistic, very gritty way. But this movie is more philosophical. It the destructive side of human nature and the contradiction between nature and beauty. And unlike Saving Private Ryan, their is no sign of patriotism. The soldiers do not fight for freedom or democracy. They fight because they have to. And the soldiers are frightened, lost and scared. This movie also shows the affects it can leave on the people who survive. The Thin Red Line is a very gripping film that sends a very powerful message.",10,1,2,13 November 2011
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Never drink from the dead!
","Interview with the vampire is easily one of the best vampire movies that have been in the whole history of modern cinema. It focuses on a 200 year old vampire who is being interviewed by a young journalist and is chronicling his whole life from before he became a vampire to the present day. This movie is different from the twilight movies. Unlike twilight, the vampires in this movie cannot survive in sunlight. It actually stays true to the mythology of vampires. Not that I did not like twilight which i did. I just think this movie is better. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are a very good team. The gore and blood is very graphic and very realistic. The scene I especially liked is when Louis goes to the theatre and burns the vampires out of revenge for Claudias murder. This is one movie not to be missed.",10,0,0,21 April 2012
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," An epic film.
","The Empire strikes back is easily the best movie in the whole Star Wars series. It has all the great characters, great visual and special effects from the original. However, it has more character development and a darker plot than the original. Rarely is a sequel better than the original, and this is one of those sequels. I especially like the performances of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leah respectively. And hands off to the guy who played Darth Vader. Although it was not directed by George Lucas, it was still very well directed. This movie is a true masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie yet watch it as soon as you get a chance. You will not regret it.",10,1,2,19 April 2016
Sin City," I don't know about you, but I'm havin' a ball.
","Sin City is one of the most beautifully shot movies that I have seen in such a long time. It stays true to the original graphic novels in every way. The film was shot in black and white with a few additions of colour. That is what makes Sin City different from other screenplays that are adapted from either comic books and graphic novels It is easily one of Robert Rodriguez's top feature films. It has a list of top notch A-list actors, including Bruce Willis, Michael Madsen and Mickey Rourke. Bruce Willis was amazing detective Hartigan. And hands off to Mickey Rourke as Marv. He is such a bad-ass. He played his role quite well and with a lot of attitude. Definitely on my list of most liked films. Sin City is worth a watch and time well spent.",10,0,1,5 December 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Not as good as the first movie, but it is better than the second one.
","I just saw this movie tonight in the theatre with my father, and I enjoyed it a lot. Not as good as the first film but better than the second one. This film starts off in the 1960's and NASA plans a top secret mission to find out about the spaceship that crash landed on the moon. There is a lot of action and explosions in this film. It was directed by Michael Bay so of course there would be lots of explosions and CGI but I thought it worked perfectly well. Truth be told, I think Michael Bay is one of the most underrated and less respected filmmakers of all time. I think it is because he has lots of explosions in his films. But if you like films with lots of explosions and lots of action, this is the film for you. I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I was very sceptical going into the theatre, and I am glad I saw it. Kudos off to Michael Bay for a job well done. It is a must see for the people who love the original transformers action figures, cartoons and the first two transformers films. You will not be disappointed.",10,21,37,13 July 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Don't call me junior!
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the best film in the whole Indiana Jones series. It also gives the title character a bit of a back story. It starts off with a young Indiana Jones and how he became who he is. Their is a lot of action and lots of humour. This time around, he is teamed up with his father who was kidnapped by Nazis who are trying to find the holy grail and Indy and his father have to get to it before the Nazis do. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have very outstanding chemistry and pull off the father son routine very well. He gets called junior by his dad and he clearly does not like to be called that. Alison Doody was spectacular as the heroine. Julian Glover was amazing as Walter Donovon, the main villain. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a very fun time of an action/adventure movie.",Null,2,3,4 March 2012
Goodfellas," Hey Spider, get me a drink.
","Goodfellas is one of the best gangster movies released in years. The acting was top notch, it is well paced, the cinematography is well done and it has a good story. This films chronicles the life of Henry Hill from when he was a teenager, when he first became a gangster and his life in the mob. Ray Liotta did a great job portraying the main character Henry Hill. Robert De Niro was amazing as Jimmy Conway. Joe Pesci did a fantastic job playing Tommy DeVito. Joe Pesci is one of Hollywood's best actors around. He can play the most violent and foul-mouthed meanies to the guy you would want to be friends with. I thought Casino was slightly better than this film but this is still an awesome movie. This would be my second favourite Scorsese film. If you like Martin Scorsese, I would definitely recommend this movie alongside with Casino. This movie is a true masterpiece. Martin Scorsese's second best film.",10,1,2,29 June 2011
Jurassic Park," Spared no expense.
","Jurassic Park is one the best movies that has ever been made. The dinosaurs look so real, the storyline is perfect, it has good character development and is very well paced. The film also has good acting and some good humour. This is definitely one of Steven Spielbergs best films to date along with Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan. While there are a lot of scenes of awe, some scenes might be too frightening for smaller children. I heard some people say that Jurassic Park was the breakthrough film with the use of CG. But it was not Jurassic Park, it was Terminator 2: Judgement Day. If you like movies that are full of suspense and awe this is the film for you. But if you like films that go right for the throat, I would recommend films like Hostel, Turistas, Wrong Turn or the Devil's Rejects.",Null,1,2,13 May 2011
