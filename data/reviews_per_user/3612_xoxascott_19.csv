Casablanca," SMART
",Genius. That is the best way to describe this movie. Everything is so meticulously put together to create something extraordinary. This movie is all about the subtle messaging so you really need to focus while watching. Also Humphrey Bogart is an acting GOD. The movie is a jumper that never lets up and grips the emotions like few others. The acting is near-perfect and its setting in WW2 makes it easily relatable since the war is an extremely well known historical event. Highly Recommended.,9,1,1,13 November 2019
12 Angry Men," Gripping
",The movie has a very easy concept to be done well and is in many ways predictable but that does not detract from the experience one bit. The movie will make you focus 100 percent the whole way through; you won't even have to try. The acting is fantastic and the messages displayed are beautiful. One of my favourite movies ever.,9,0,1,13 November 2019
Ted," WATCH IF NOT SENSITIVE
","Movie is hilarious, vulgar and entertaining. It is actually surprisingly very memorable. If you look past its profanity you'll see it is actually a movie that is well put together, with a good plot and character development. Good ending as well.",8,1,3,13 November 2019
Point Break," My cup of tea
","This movie is totally up my alley although it might not be up yours. If you love freedom, rebellion, action, and abject loyalty to your values you will probably love this movie. I loved the stunts, story and plot twists. Acting was good but could be better. Plot is a little crazy so if you're close-minded you probably won't like it.",8,3,4,13 November 2019
Full Metal Jacket," MUST WATCH A SECOND TIME
","This movie is super wierd, but its brilliant. Stanley Kubrick's recreation of the life of a marine makes you feel things you didn't think were possible. Just accept it and go for the ride. The acting is amazing and the movie glues your eyes to the screen. It uses unique tactics to show things like violence in a powerful way that I've never really seen in any other war movies before. Watching it a second time round, where the oddness doesn't grip too strongly will help you see how amazing and bewildering of a movie it really is. First half is better than second half though",9,0,1,13 November 2019
Dunkirk," History buff's favourite
","The movie is smart, has a brilliant cast, and covers the historical aspect of the event fantastically. It's fun to watch and contains one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It is emotionally intriguing as well. The one thing I would like to have seen more of would have been stronger character development. However, taking into account the relatively limited setting he had two work with (one beach in France during a hasty evacuation), Christopher Nolan has done a remarkable job.",8,0,6,17 November 2019
Django Unchained," Great
",Very entertaining and beautiful movie. Typical Quentin Tarantino film. Acting is extraordinary specefically from Leonardo Dicaprio and Christoph Waltz. Cool ending with a great message in my opinion as well. May watch again if i feel like it.,7,0,4,14 November 2019
Black Hawk Down," Popular type
","Black Hawk Down is an iconic movie. It may not be very down to earth in some aspects but it is still a very strong film. The movie is inspirational and pays great gratitude to the men and women who serve in uniform. The acting is fantastic, along with the soundtrack, and grips you from the start. If you like war films, you'll love this, thats probably the best way to put it.",8,0,1,13 November 2019
Pulp Fiction," Strong Movie
","The movie is a classic, without a doubt. Its very entertaining and features fantastic acting and writing. The movie however, does not have the most powerful meaning its more something that you watch for fun. I must also admit that Quentin Tarantino's style is not my cup of tea. However, I still have to respect the ingenuity of which this film has been made.",7,2,3,14 November 2019
Titanic," Immature-But still good
","The movie would make a super mature person laugh because of how stupid it can be once in a while. However, it is well made and entertaining to watch with strong acting and good characters. The main message of the film is also fantastic. I must admit the movie is not my cup of tea but I can definetely see why other people would totally adore it.",8,3,6,13 November 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," The Greatest Movie I have ever seen
","Shawshenk Redemption is truly on a level of its own. Fantastic plot, writing etc. The ending is probably the most baddass ending in a movie ever. What I really love about the movie is its incredibly realistic portrayal of evil and the harsher realities of life. The movie feels 5 hours long, but by the end you wish it were 10 hours. Extraordinary acting by Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton and the rest of the cast. However, I only gave it a 9 because there is always room for improvement.",9,0,0,13 November 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," LOL
","Movie is a joke. Stupid concept, characters, story development, stupid everything. It is fun to watch though.",2,1,2,14 November 2019
Black Panther," Disaster
",Extremely forgettable. Weak plot and characters. Somewhat boring and no really powerful or intelligent messaging. Waste of time.,1,1,3,13 November 2019
The Matrix," GUTS
","The Matrix may not be the best movie of all time, however, I have more respect for the Wachowski brothers than the director of any other movie. Watch and you will understand what I mean by having guts. The Matrix is a sci-fi thriller that won't dissapoint. Make sure you're focused every step of the way. Enjoy.",10,0,0,13 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," PET PEEVE
","I get it. Star Wars may be very entertaining, well made and the acting is great. However, there is one thing about Star Wars that I simply can't swallow. In real life bad and evil people don't go out and yell 'I'm evil' like Vader and The Emperor. Or say that the dark side has all the power. They generally hide it under some false narrative. That to me makes the movie such a joke and hilariously immature. Now people may say that its only a kids movie but is it really? And even if it is, I don't think its smart to teach kids these things. Thats all.",3,2,8,14 November 2019
Gladiator," STRONG MOVIE
","Kind of what you would hope every action movie would be. Dramatic (in a good way), entertaining, intriguing, great acting, and grips the emotions very well. Romantic side of the story is done very nicely. Plot and story could be stronger but overall still a very enjoyable and insightful movie that I would recommend.",8,2,3,13 November 2019
Goodfellas," Great Night Out
","Extremely entertaining and interesting. Acting is phenomenal which is unsurprising considering you have a cast including, Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci. Movie is very intriguing with lots of twists, and does a great job showing the horrors of the gang world, even if it does so in a bit of an eccentric way. Would definetely watch again if i felt like it.",8,0,0,13 November 2019
Draft Day," Well-Made
",Strong movie that is well put together. The movie has a good number of surprises. The story plays itself out extremely well. Kevin Costner and his fantastic acting is arguably the movie's best asset. Very enjoyable and worth it for any football fan.,7,0,0,13 November 2019
The Godfather," Crazy High Standard
","Francis Ford Coppola must be a real perfectionist. The Godfather is an extremely artisinal film that can be compared to few others. The acting is unbelievable and the story is super intriguing. It takes the mafia world in a tone of 100 percent seriousness, unlike many other mob movies. The movie is also filled with surprises and loaded with powerful messages. Love it.",9,0,1,13 November 2019
