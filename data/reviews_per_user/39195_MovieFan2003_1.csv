Catch Me If You Can," Pure Entertainment!
","Hanks and DiCaprio are right on form in what must be Steven Spielberg's most enjoyable and entertaining movie since Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade in 1989.After a slow first 30 minutes, the film kicks into high gear as we follow the cat and mouse game between DiCaprio and Hanks.  Excellent 60s set pieces, costume design and an excellent, sometimes moody 60s soundtrack make what is already a brilliantly told story even better!This is the kind of film that perfects the reason why we go to the cinema - to escape from ordinary life.  Why can't all films be this entertaining.....?",9,1,2,21 February 2003
