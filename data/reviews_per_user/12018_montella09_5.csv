3:10 to Yuma," Brilliant film-making
","This film was an action-packed, very entertaining western with modern effects. The acting was none other than SUPERB, from everyone, but especially Bale. There was not one dull moment and the story-line was riveting. The various symbolism, motifs and imagery in the movie was just fantastic, and I would say most actual men out here can really connect with the major themes in this movie (sacrifice, honour, protection of family, camaraderie, pride, the conflict between right vs wrong and which is best to do for those you care about in different circumstances, etc.). Everyone do yourself a favour for once and go see this movie, I promise you will not be disappointed, 10/10.",10,1,5,14 September 2007
28 Weeks Later," disgusting film, disgusting world we live in
","It appears the world is being consumed by violence and blood once again. All we do is blame it on religion and other things when if we actually took the time to read through our religious texts, we would see how to avoid a world of such senseless destruction. Hope, faith, spirituality, the knowledge that we are much more than our physical/biological selves. I guess showing good things on screen doesn't make you money at the box office, so these movies don't get made ????? Huh ????? I don't care if the rest of humanity fails, but I know that I won't fail because I know what I believe in and he will never let me down.",3,0,6,23 May 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," this one keeps you guessing
","If you are a die-hard X-men fanatic like me, you probably went into this one a bit skeptical, especially with a change in director. However, I was pleasantly surprised by X-Men: The Last Stand and Brett Ratner's overall abilities as a director.I think the most important thing to point out about this film is that it wasn't the storyline or characters which made it stand out from the previous installments - it was the special effects and cinematography. Most of the scenes were incredibly done and I kept wondering throughout the film how long it must have taken to complete them (especially the Golden Gate Bridge sequence). I have to say that all of the computer generated graphics were the most realistic I think I've seen, easily on par with what was seen in the latest Star Wars or Spider-Man films.The story itself wasn't anything spectacular, and comparable to the last two, while also I must say remaining true to the characters in the comic books. Many aspects of the plot kept you guessing throughout and left me hoping for a sequel. With this in mind, things didn't get out of hand either and the film continued the same portrayal of the main characters as in the first two. Ratner also did a good job at not going overboard with the role of the Dark Pheonix which could easily have taken up too much of the story.The acting was for the most part as good as the previous films and Kelsey Grammar was a very convincing Beast. I did however notice the increase in the number of punch lines, pretty much anytime anyone was in a fight. Most were decent, but it kinda got out of hand, notably when Juggernaut cussed at a very young looking Kitty Pride (this is a family film right ?) Other than this, I didn't have any other complaints.Overall the film was a complete and entertaining action thrill ride which clearly had a much larger special effects budget than the previous installments. Cheers to Brett Ratner for staying true to the series as well as bringing to life more of the 'dazzle' of the X-Men. 9/10.",7,0,2,28 May 2006
Casino Royale," the best bond, ever
","I have bee an avid Bond fan my entire life, and despite all the rave reviews for Casino Royale, it took me a while to get around and finally see it. Now that I have, I more than know why people love it so much. This is by far the best Bond movie, EVER. I loved Connery as Bond, and I loved the one good Bond film by Brosnan (i.e. Goldeneye), but Daniel Craig is simply outstanding as Bond. The movie overall was just outstanding and I've never been so excited and so into an action movie. It was so much more than perfect action though, it was fantastic acting, a beautiful European cinematography and setting, an overall darker theme/feel to both Bond and the story, non-stop surprises and plot twists, amazing soundtrack, and of course, the ridiculously gorgeous Eva Green. This movie will always have a special place in my favourite movies list. It was the Bond film that surpassed all others. If its anything like this movie, I say bring on the next installment !",10,0,5,4 May 2007
300," breathtaking
","I just came back from the movie and '300' by far lived up to my highest of expectations. I usually hate going to the cinemas because of the ignorant people who refuse to be quiet during the movie, but that was surprisingly not an issue this time. This is because '300' was just so astonishing that nobody wanted to miss one second, and the filled theater was really quiet for such an action-packed film.Everything about this movie stands out and I really think it has set a new standard for how ancient myths, legends or (in this case) classical history should be presented on the big screen. The acting was top notch, the sound was superb and above all, the visual effects and cinematography were breathtaking. If you enjoy watching film-making at its best, then I assure you that this is a must-see. 'This is SPARTA !!!'",10,2,8,10 March 2007
