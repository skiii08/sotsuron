The Ring," Creepy mood, too many loose ends
","Spoilers!! While entertaining with good photography and mood, there were enough holes n the plotting to make me very disappointed with 'The Ring.' Call me what you want, but here are some questions I have:1) So who made the videotape? 2) Why did the well appear under the motel room floorboards when we clearly see it was out in the field when the mom tried to kill the kid? 3) Why was it necessary to see that the kid had been kept in the room upstairs in the barn? It wasn't necessary to the plot. That's not where the kid spent the rest of her days. That's not where she was murdered. She was probably only there for a short while before her mom took her out to the well and tried to murder her. 4) How come there was no exploration of where the kid was adopted? That may have helped to explain her origins. 5) What's that whole confusing thing at the end about people who make copies can't be killed but those who are give the copy can? What? That's all I can figure out about why at the end she's making another copy with her son and they seem to feel they're not going to be killed, but maybe someone else is. Huh? 6) Do you actually have to pick up the phone and listen to the voice telling you you're going to die in 7 days, or doesn't it matter if you hear the message or not? And how do they get the phone number to call in the first place? 7) Why would a potential victim cause a horse to go crazy?I love horror and sci-fi films, but if they set up a universe where supernatural events occur, they have to follow their own internal logic. It's got to be real for the world the characters live in. Otherwise, it's just a film director throwing things at us like a big cheater and there's no point in understanding anything that goes on. The film just becomes a series of unconnected scenes and strange odd bits.",2,1,2,8 December 2002
Knowing," 'Adam & Eve' and the Tree of Knowledge
","I haven't read all the comments, but someone did mention the 'Adam & Eve' imagery at the end of the film. I just want to add that the obvious Edenic Tree they are heading for makes this a return to innocence, where the whole process of become human starts over again. There are probably some forbidden apples, too. You may or may not appreciate the overt religious theme (or, rather, 'aliens and religion theme'), but the kids and the tree pretty much cement that interpretation. I must admit to being somewhat startled with the apocalyptic ending; but I liked the fact that the movie had the guts to be true to its nature and not pull any punches. Another film that has an actual 'end of the world' with religious bent is the superb, highly recommended Mimi Rogers-starring 'The Rapture.'",5,1,3,19 April 2009
