Black Swan," This is the art of the true cinema!
","Black Swan: This Bracingly powerful, thought provoking thriller is another Aronofsky's masterpiece. Brilliant performances, melodramatic acting, intense imagery and Aronofsky's signature touch makes Black Swan one of the directors best.",8,1,2,9 June 2019
Requiem for a Dream," An incredibly touching film of addiction, loss and family. Confronting and powerfully honest.
","Requiem for a Dream is a 2000 American psychological tragedy film directed by Darren Aronofsky. This is a somewhat unusual movie, displaying a variety of cinematic techniques, which mostly work well. It really drew me in, and by the end I had connected with the characters and their downfall. An interesting but ultimately tragic film.",8,0,0,23 June 2019
Bridge of Spies," Well done; I enjoyed it.
","Bridge of Spies is the rare historical drama that balances drama, humor, and suspense while offering incredible performances from both Hanks and Rylance, along with confident direction in Spielberg and a taut script, making this espionage thriller a bar above the rest in terms of craftsmanship and political tension",9,1,2,9 June 2019
