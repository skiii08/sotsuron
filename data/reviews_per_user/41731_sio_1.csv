The Ring," Please destroy and bury this film.
","This film was appalling, and didn't scare me in the slightest. Granted, there was some suspense there, but this was simply due to the hype surrounding the movie - I constantly expected something to jump out and terrify me, but it just didn't happen. I would have been equally scared watching Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, had I been warned that it was 'the scariest film of the year'.There were far too many plot holes, the characters were boring, and it took me about 3 hours after leaving the cinema to figure out what the heck the ending was supposed to mean.I'd like to blame the film's quality on the director and dismiss it as a bad remake, but having seen the original I can safely say that both versions are equally terrible.If you're easily scared and don't care whether a film makes sense or not as long as it throws in as many horror movie conventions as possible and builds up suspense with lots of scary music leading up to a huge anticlimax, go and see this film. I expect you'll love it. Otherwise watch the original, laugh at how bad it is, and trust me when I say that the remake is even worse.",Null,0,1,9 May 2003
