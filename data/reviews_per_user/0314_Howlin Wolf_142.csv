The Devil's Advocate," What's your Price?
","When you're in the mood for something unsubtle but visceral, it pays off to give 'The Devil's Advocate' a spin.I have to admit it has a style that's relentlessly 'over-the-top', so to some that might be a turn-off, but I like it because it's really easy to watch. It has a nice flow to it, which must be down to Hackford's direction.Plus, you get to see Al Pacino chewing scenery! Everyone criticises his 'shouty' acting, but it makes me feel really alive when I see a performer get that passionate in their work. James Woods is another guy who has that manic quality going on, too, and it's riveting when they're in full flow. I can't take my eyes off them.Keanu Reeves is often mocked for his lack of expressiveness, but this time his casual manner is the perfect foil for his co-star's maniacal air of mischief.Ultimately the movie abandons all attempt at any kind of moral/legal parallel by the finale, choosing instead just to give Al space for his personalised, paraphrased riffs on Paradise Lost material, so if you're expecting consistently sensible and thought-provoking, then you're probably at the wrong gig. If however you only seek to be lavishly entertained, then surrender to your inner hedonist and dive right in. You may not respect yourself for it in the morning, but hey, tomorrow's another day. 'Live for the moment!', as the devil on your left shoulder would say... :-)",7,2,3,26 November 2007
Whip It," Gentle Do-si-do...
","Whip It was a movie I wanted to like more than I did... The storyline was a little bit twee and predictable, with all of the 'small-town underdog' sports clichés... but, on the other hand, first-time director Drew Barrymore's handling of things is as charming as Barrymore herself seems to be... so, if you don't mind predictability, like roller derby, and just want a non-taxing feelgood film, then this could be it...It has a great soundtrack, too, so that's in its favour.Barrymore seems to be fond of fairy tales, so if you like miraculous yet never less than wholesome transformations, and inspirational sloganeering such as 'Be Your Own Hero!', then this will probably suit you a treat... It's not that I'm against those things, it's just that these warm fuzzies sometimes come at the expense of teaching you about the realities of life... but, if you've seen 'Never Been Kissed' before and enjoyed it, then at least you'll know the type of thing to expect.",5,3,4,23 October 2012
Vertigo," Ooh, what a rush!!
","No-one enjoyed toying with people's minds quite like Hitch; and 'Vertigo' is a film that earns its right to sit proudly alongside his other psychological masterpieces. Stewart is superb and perfectly cast as the archetypal 'common man' who, after an accident, suddenly finds himself embroiled in a dizzying mystery he struggles to keep up with. If this all sounds a bit too 'Rear Window', it plays sufficiently fresh to offer its own distinct pleasures, but it would probably be true to say that fans of one will certainly delight in the other, as well.From the captivating vortex of the title sequence onward, 'Vertigo' plunges headlong into the story. This wouldn't be Hitchcock without even a hint of a Macguffin, but the real power of the story for me came from being drawn into someone's obsession, and of course the stunning climax of its ultimate resolution. A widely acknowledged classic that's lost none of its thrall in the modern age, 'Vertigo' is totally absorbing, and grips you like few other tales have managed to do.",8,6,7,30 May 2006
Black Swan," The ugly signet goes on her journey...
","I'm not normally keen on melodramas, and this was definitely one of those... but, to be fair, the ending tied together the more over-the-top moments pretty well. Ultimately I enjoyed it, but I definitely wouldn't herald it as some kind of masterful psychological drama. The big scenes spin too frequently into hysteria to be effectively chilling, for me. It's hardly subtle, but it does work well if high-camp and grandiosity is what you're after. What it does do is confirm that Aronofsky is always willing to take risks and do interesting things with the projects he chooses to make. Like the film itself, he's never dull, but he's not always classy, either. At least he can't be easily pigeonholed (beyond his consistent work in the independent sector, that is)",7,4,6,1 January 2012
Scarface," Never underestimate the lure of ambition...
","I love this film, and I'm not someone who's weighed down by gold chains or sees it as an instructional tool. Nor is Roger Ebert, so that dismantles one stereotype right from the start. I love the moody synthesized music used as an opener. I love the film's first stroke of genius in updating the basic story so that it includes footage of Castro's actions, and the subsequent arrival of many Cubans on American shores. Straight away an ominous feeling kicks in and you understand that you have a whole subculture of people starting at the bottom rung on the economic ladder. Some will want to make their way honestly and contribute positively to the community around them, but there will always be a few individuals who choose to circumvent the hard-working route and instead get rich and fat quickly on ill-gotten gains.I love Al Pacino's perfect display of sneering insouciance, directed at everyone right from his introduction as Tony Montana. I love the way he embraces the myriad flaws of the man and expands upon them the further into the story we get. I love the honesty with which the narrative details his ruthlessness - there are no friends in Montana's world, only people who can do something for him. I love it when he achieves every material pleasure he wants and is still not happy. I love his topple from the peak of an empire. I love the sheer braggadocio with which Pacino executes every last defiant gesture. I love the fact that Oliver Stone's script was written from experience during a time when he was a man who had been seduced by demons of his own. All of this I love, and yet I would hate to idolise Tony. It's a warning against over-reaching oneself that is the equal of anything Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, for example... Literary parallels are not impossible - nor are they foolish to make - for this film.",10,0,1,9 June 2007
Alien 3," People are resistant to change...
","Well done David Fincher for having the courage to rip up some of what was established by the film's two predecessors and instead work from a template that allowed him to bring his own unique vision to the screen.(SPOILERS)Having Ripley sacrifice herself at the end would have been a masterstroke had she not been brought back for a fourth outing, and the restriction of weapons on the prison planet provided a nice contrast to James Cameron's more gung-ho installment.  As for Hicks and Newt, these were characters introduced and developed by another director in a totally different context. The thing I've always liked about the franchise is that each film is markedly different by virtue of having a new director.  Usually people are the first to complain if a sequel offers the audience nothing different from what has been seen before.  You can't have it both ways...I'm not trying to claim that this is the best of the series, far from it, but I think that this film gets unfairly slated because Fincher had the guts to try and do something different with it.  I can picture the dismay on the faces of the studio chiefs when they learned about Ripley's fate.  It's kinda sad that they felt the need to concoct a fourth installment because it probably wasn't due to artistic inspiration, but rather an excuse to squeeze another few drops from such a lucrative cash-cow.Much of what is on display here is good, the shaving of Ripley's hair robs her of any femininity she may have had, which is kinda ironic since some would say that the ultimate symbol of femininity is childbirth, and she has something growing inside her, but it ain't human!  The prison planet is a beautifully constructed oppressive environment which gives Fincher the dark and gloomy motif he's since proved he's au fait with, and the supporting cast was nicely chosen, providing plenty of opportunity for exploiting the tense dramatic situation, rather than resorting to the standard stalk'n' slash scenario all the time, (which the film still doesn't skimp on, for the more gore-hungry amongst you)IMHO, fans of the franchise should accept its continual evolving nature and concentrate instead on praising Fincher's film for what it is, a bold, worthy addition to an almost classic pantheon.",7,1,4,23 February 2001
Gremlins," Original premise supports the movie until the 'Gremlins' arrive... then it's a riot! (SPOILERS)
","The atmospheric opening sequence in 'Chinatown'... the father who is a klutz of an inventor... the local harridan... the Mogwai. All of these elements will keep you entertained during the first portion of the movie, 'Gizmo' especially, but it's when the Gremlins arrive that the real fun starts! Ever heard of the phrase 'Build it up, tear it down'? Well that's exactly the technique that Dante and Spielberg use here, building up the aura of quintessential small-town America and then gleefully allowing their malevolent little protégés to tear down that image by running amok!As mentioned, the first segment is still entertaining. Mrs Deagle, the harridan, is wonderfully evil and still scares me to this day (As does 'The Wicked Witch of the West' in 'The Wizard of Oz'!), Gizmo is cute enough to have kids all over the world screaming petulantly at their parents 'I want one!', and there is constant delight at seeing such inventiveness being practised. Once Gizmo gets wet, however, the movie cranks up several notches and never slows down. There are several great set-pieces, which I won't spoil here.Particularly satisfying is the sense that Spielberg is poking fun at the schmaltzy nature of some of the previous projects he's been behind. There is a wicked sense of humour on display here, from both director and producer, and several scenes might scare sensitive kids. However, I used to love getting scared and thrilled at the same time, and that's what this movie does so well for youngsters. Part of its attraction when I was growing up, I think... To give the impression that only kids will enjoy it is false though. This is a fun movie for all the family that continues the tradition of great 80's flicks with something for everyone, a la 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Back to the Future'. A real treat.",9,0,1,23 March 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Very good film that seems to me to have been made into something it is not...
","There is no denying that on the evidence of both this and 'Pi', Darren Aronofsky is a hugely talented young director. What he is NOT, at least by judging him on this film alone, is the saviour of cinema. Cinema is doing okay anyway right now, and the arrival of 'Requiem for a Dream', however daring its attempt to show the viewer a bleak worldview of people who are devoid of real hope, is not going to change that for better or worse.Its theme of isolation and a despair so great that there is nothing you can (or wouldn't) do to relieve yourself of it, is nothing really new; neither is its causal relationship with drugs. Admittedly, one of the things the film IS to be praised for doing is showing that this kind of dependency isn't EXCLUSIVELY formed with narcotics. There are scenes of substance abuse in the movie, but arguably more powerful are the scenes where the 'drug' in question instead seems to be something that superficially is thought less harmful, i.e. TV, or social acceptance, or... you get the idea.These themes and the way they are dealt with and explored are what makes 'Requiem for a Dream' interesting to watch. However, so many people are effusive when they use adjectives such as 'devastating' to communicate the impact that the film had on them, that I have to wonder if I am becoming so desensitised that things no longer shock me. I'm sure this can't be the case, but I've really felt much more unsettled after films than the experience I had with this one. Sure, 'Requiem... ' had an effect on me, but I feel confident that I could watch it again several times without feeling unable to cope anymore. There are plenty of films that I consider more disturbing than this, and funnily enough, most of them are British! Heck, even the ending of 'Chinatown' got to me more than anything in 'Requiem', and no one advises caution to anyone preparing to watch that, do they? The film indeed does have some interesting things to say, but its a shame that after reading several comments on here, people who consider themselves hardened movie watchers might approach this film with their arms folded and an attitude of: 'Shock me' Far better instead to seek it out for its dazzling cinematic treatment of a quite familiar theme. Make no mistake, this film is definitely CINEMATIC, and Aronofsky pulls out every stylistic trick in the book to emphasise the movie's most important points.He is helped by the efforts of a uniformly excellent cast. Burstyn in particular is heartbreaking. For all the attention grabbing techniques used, it is the human suffering that will stay with you after you eject the tape. In fact, I think that may be WHY it wasn't nearly as disconcerting as I was perhaps expecting, because once or twice Aronofsky's tricks come dangerously close to over-egging the pudding, when he might have been better letting the performances speak for themselves.'Requiem...' was one of the better - and certainly one of the most INNOVATIVE - films I saw last year, but I still feel that perhaps some people desperate for a 'cinema revelation', have adorned the wrong movie as having provided it.",8,0,1,11 April 2002
Skyfall," What do you do when the sky falls?
","If some would take issue with it being described as one of the best Bond films of its generation (although I think that this is correct) then I submit instead that perhaps it IS the most relevant.Issues of fealty, the necessity of our security services, and the changing face of global terrorism are all themes that are explored. Our hero is forced to confront the fact that he is expendable, and to acknowledge his place as a cog that's part of a much larger machine... The villain takes entirely the opposite perspective, which makes for an interesting ideological clash.Indeed, no-one is invaluable, and 'M' questioning her conduct leads to a much more prominent role for Judi Dench, and meatier interaction between her and her agent, which is no bad thing.However, the cost of this is that Bardem's villain is woefully underused... Bardem is such a good actor that it almost doesn't matter, and I get that the laser focus of his mission makes extrapolation unnecessary... but he gets so much build-up, courtesy of his associates... Then, when he finally appears, although he's not exactly a pussycat, he is a little one-dimensional; an insane, Lecter-like baddie - more horror-film shocking, than a ruthless megalomaniac.There has been a recent sea-change from over the top action to something approaching character-study, though... and I applaud that. Bond may no longer be lovelorn, as he was previously in QOS, but he's still an existential loner, and it suits the icy reserves of Daniel Craig quite well... Bond was faced with proving he's a man for his times, and the verdict is: 'Cometh the hour, cometh the man!' If you want to prove you're still up to the job, you have to go back to basics... and it's 'mission accomplished', as far as this film is concerned.",10,3,14,7 November 2012
Ghost," Love never dies.
","Now I'm sorry if you find the summary above trite in any way, but I figure if countless horrific tales say the same thing about evil then its only fair that we should have a lighter contrast to think about! The soul of 'Ghost' is sweet natured; it offers a little something for everybody provided they are content to let the odd corny moment and occasional spot of sappiness slide.All of the cast do well (even Swayze, despite it reportedly being offered to every possible leading man in Hollywood before him) and the concept is a true crowd-pleaser because it contains elements that will appeal to a variety of different types. Sensitive folk will connect with the pure love story, thriller fans will enjoy the details of the plot, and fantasy buffs will appreciate the effects and the exploration of the afterlife. It's a blend of different styles that works well throughout, and is undoubtedly one of the key reasons why the film became such a big hit.Stealing the show is supporting actress Whoopi Goldberg. At times it feels like the part of her character was expanded upon when the creative team saw for themselves what she was going to be able to do with it. I don't know whether or not that's true, but it's such a memorable performance that every now and again it even eclipses the main romance.If you're searching for a piece of popular entertainment that's manipulative in a good way, then 'Ghost' is a one-stop shop catering to all your needs.",9,1,2,31 July 2007
Iron Man 3," Stark learns more harsh lessons about power and responsibility
","The plot here is definitely stronger than the second one. The previous film had a rich setup that seemed to go nowhere in the last act, whereas this starts out with a pretty basic theme that becomes more complex as the narrative progresses. There's a definite 'Manchurian Candidate' vibe at work, here. The people in power have their puppets, but Stark has no-one to hide behind; everyone knows who he is and what he's done, and that brings on its own stresses and pressures that the story takes its time to work through.One plot development that sadly wasn't fleshed out enough to convince me is the suits You have the newly acquired ability to control and command them via remote assistance, and yet you destroy them as soon as the threat is vanquished?! I know he wanted to concentrate on Pepper, but surely that involves USING the suits less, not canning them completely? Introducing such a new facility only to dispense with it pretty arbitrarily makes it feel more like a deus ex machina than a realistic element that fits seamlessly with Tony' s background. Plus, it's also too convenient in the service of the plot that the suit he ends up with for the majority of his endeavours just happens to be a model that's not working properly!Still, there's more going on here and more to think about than in the tired second instalment, so on those terms, it's a definite improvement.",7,1,2,21 May 2013
Casablanca," Of all the films in all the world...
","... this must be the one where the romance of everything appeals to me the most. You have the passionate but doomed re-acquaintance, set against a time when to even look a day into the future was uncertain. Best of all, the guy I'm supposed to relate to from this couple is the boozing, sarcastic incarnation of Humphrey Bogart! Part of me feels like you haven't suffered unless you're someone who's destined for the gutter and bitter at how the world has turned out. An attitude that comes from reading too much pre-18th century poetry, no doubt... (Further insight may also be found in my review of 'The Libertine'.)Anyway, all of the most important details within the story seem to have been collected especially for my benefit, although I guess I'm not the only one, since the film continues to be popular right up to the present day. Truth is, this is a movie for anyone who inwardly looks upon themselves as a cynic with a heart of gold.The question I ask myself though is: Would I be brave and selfless enough to give up my one true love for the sake of humanity in general? I don't think so, although I still cling to memories of a faded love, I have no pretensions of being so noble about it. That is why we have indelible movie-stars and characters, though - Heroes who do the things we wish we could do, and are strong enough to take the consequences of the hardest choices. Rick Blaine and 'Casablanca' are monuments to the notion of 'doing the decent thing', and it is this quality that makes the script and performances come alive. Watching it should be a magical experience.",8,5,10,14 April 2007
Finding Neverland," You can go anywhere that your imagination will let you...
","... and if the will is strong enough; the destiny that you create for yourself will win through. It's sometimes the kiss of death to call a film 'inspirational', because art loses some of its visceral magic if analysed too thoroughly - but 'magic' is the very pinion of Neverland's appeal. If you're receptive to enchantment, your belief can take you anywhere...Fine acting all around; but in a nice change, it was the ladies who held the most grace, for me. Maybe it's because most of the boys were ALREADY in touch with their 'inner child - it was a joy to see the women connect in that way, eventually, too.There are certain adult associates of Barrie's throughout the film who would doubtless give their eye-teeth to be able to get inside his head. Priviliged are the children of all ages in the audience, then; for this is a rarity of a picture that enables its watchers to do just that.",9,3,3,13 April 2005
John Wick," Got on my Wick...
","You could have written this on the back of a napkin... 'Guy's dog is murdered; guy goes mental, efficiently killing those responsible. The End'. There's no colour to the story, whatsoever; there are only garish colours in the nightclub scenes. If all you need to think something is cool is to see people getting beaten up or shot, then join the Army... Indiscriminately colouring random subtitles to look like comic book speech panels got old fast, too.This is going to make me sound all 'get off my lawn' (if I hadn't already!) but action movies used to be done so much better... These days, apparently all you need to make a popular action film is some fast editing and fight choreography, with the barest hint of a premise that absolutely no thought has gone into fleshing out - the end result being that the finished product has less depth than a puddle. I must be demanding, but for what I want out of even the most streamlined revenge flick, that just ain't good enough!",4,6,10,10 February 2016
Chinatown," Indelibly etched on the noir landscape.
","Even though it was made in 1974, almost 30 years after the 'noir period' in Hollywood could be said to have ended, Chinatown remains as much one of the hallmarks of that classic style as do movies from the golden era themselves ('The Big Sleep', 'Touch of Evil' etc)   Director Polanski and screenwriter Towne have created a faultless universe filled with some of the most memorable characters ever to grace a cinema screen.  Chief amongst these is embittered private eye Jake Gittes, played expertly by Jack Nicholson.  Gittes has a quick wit and a low tolerance for fools, but he won't rest until he's finally solved a case. When Evelyn Mulray (Dunaway) appears on the scene, it sets in motion an astonishing chain of events that harks back to an era in Jake's life he's trying to put behind him.  'Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown... '   The mystery that unfolds is labyrinthine, but even if you're not a big 'whodunnit' fan, it's worth seeing this for the quality of the performances and writing alone.  Some might find the ending too bleak and abrupt; I did at first, but on reflection I realised it suited the desperate quality that hangs around the characters in the film like the smell of death.  Polanski has never been as good as this, Nicholson has never been better.  Great directing, great acting, great writing, great film.

Monty Python's Life of Brian," Contains moments of inspired lunacy...
","Don't let the more fanatical Python acolytes fool you that the duration of 'Life of Brian' is ALL tea and biscuits, but it's certainly a more ORGANISED affair than 'Holy Grail', and, like that film, contains some truly ingenious moments.  I have the nagging feeling that the production values were perhaps TOO good on this one, though, as such lending the film an inappropriately solemn feel even as you're doubling up on the floor laughing at one of the team's astute observations.  I suspect if the Pythons were at their peak today, the resulting 'spoof' would have been much sharper and less gentle.  Still, who really has the right to complain when such gems as 'Blessed are the Cheesemakers!' are still present?  It is this and many other classic moments that make this a joy to watch time and time again, even if its more devoted fans may have fallen victim to the very thing the film lampoons - hailing the wrong Messiah.  It's top drawer comedy for those who don't unrealistically expect the Second Coming before viewing.",9,0,2,10 May 2002
Se7en," Se7en gruesome chapters of a killer's manifesto...
","'Se7en' is unique because of the extraordinary sympathy it manages to foster for its two main characters; it's unique because of its bleak, hopeless environment that serves as a symptom of civilization's general decline. It's strengthened by its brilliant performances capturing mostly decent people struggling to survive in the sewer without becoming tainted by it. The fictional John Doe would most likely agree with all these theoretical snapshots of despair - the difference comes in his psychopathic desire to come up with a plan that he thinks will solve it.Few forms of popular entertainment manage to afford the villain his say whilst still maintaining a sensible distance from his horrific acts. What I like best is the film's depressing contention that there isn't as much distinction as we think between the good guys and the bad guys. We're all affected by the distasteful aspects of society, but do we just hope that our own positive contributions will be enough to offset them - or in extreme situations, when we stare into the abyss, will the abyss stare back at us? Some may well be upset that the killer's justification contains reasoned objections. It is really only by resorting to crime that he reveals himself as a madman. Rather than be outraged, though, I prefer to celebrate good writing that allows us to see hidden facets of an issue, however unpalatable the resultant consequences of such a viewpoint may turn out to be.",10,2,2,14 January 2008
The Big Lebowski," An utter delight from beginning to end. (SLIGHT SPOILER)
","Whilst I can't say it's the best FILM I've ever seen - there's a lot of competition for that title, and it's hard to pick just one - I CAN say that it's the best COMEDY I've ever seen. (Until 2005, when it was eclipsed by 1968's 'The Odd Couple'... ) The characters are just so eccentric yet superbly complex and detailed, as in all of the Coen's previous movies. The writing is treated with the same level of sophistication that the brothers bring to all their work, It's NOT dumbed down just by virtue of it being a comedy. Almost every line in the script is ripe for quotation.On a comedy level it works perfectly, but the storyline itself is just as intricate as we've come to expect from Joel and Ethan. Don't worry if you don't fully understand the plot machinations, it doesn't really matter when you are laughing so hard.Bridges is perfect as the perpetually stoned 'Dude'. He infuses the character with such a likable charm that you're likely to be smiling even when he hasn't said anything. There are an array of other colourful characters, but 'The Dude' - ahem - 'really ties the film together'. He is a filmic icon and should be regarded as such for all time. There's also a great cameo by Sam Elliot (Man, I loved that guy in 'Mask'!)True, the film can't quite sustain its momentum throughout its running time, so there are slow spots (I didn't enjoy the scenes with Julianne Moore's character nearly as much as the others) but when it gets it right it's hilarious, and there are so many scenes that I wish I had wrote, but then I don't have 1/1000th of the talent of the REAL scripters.The Coens have created a filmic universe that you (or at least this writer) want to inhabit yourselves. The characters seem so lifelike and leap off the screen. I'm just waiting for the brothers to pen a sequel, I need to catch up on the further adventures of 'The Dude' and his buddy Walter; even the sadly departed 'Donny' (That calls for a prequel) How about it guys? Could you see your way clear... ?'Nice marmot!'P.S. Oh yeah, and the dream sequences are weird and wonderful too, watch for them! I have the song 'Just Dropped In (To see what condition my condition was in)' buzzing around my head as I type! Chilled...Gotta go, a 'White Russian' is calling... !",10,0,1,18 November 2001
Unbreakable," Shyamalan may just be a one-trick pony...
","'The Sixth Sense' was a great movie; and while 'Unbreakable' is not truly awful, it does perhaps suggest that we should reserve judgement for a few more films before hailing its director as the new 'wunderkind' of his generation.The main problem with the film for me was that almost every aspect of its style was familiar after watching the 'Sixth Sense'. Sure, they have different plots, but there are a number of striking similarities. Bruce Willis playing a reserved 'everyman' type, both movies being bookended with set-pieces or twists, and the slow pacing. Don't get me wrong, it was very good when he used these things the first time round, but I wanted something a little different from his second outing.The film still managed to hold my attention though, and the plot was more unusual and complex than may seem apparent at first glance. No complaints about Willis' performance again, and Jackson is also good in a different type of role to that he usually plays. Even Robin Wright-Penn is good as Dunn's wife, despite the fact that her character plays little more than a bit-part in the main thrust of the story.So there IS a lot to like here, and if you haven't seen 'The Sixth Sense' then my gripes won't make any difference to how you view the film. I personally got tired by what I saw as a basic retread by Shyamalan of his earlier effort, with a few plot points re jigged for good measure. Also, the ending - which I won't reveal here - lacks punch when compared to the surprise at the end of 'The Sixth Sense'.At the time of writing, Shyamalan is reportedly planning an 'Unbreakable' trilogy. This doesn't bode well for me; because like I said, it WAS an innovative style when it first appeared, but it has the potential to lose its appeal when repeated over three or four movies.",5,1,3,19 October 2001
Fight Club," Mindblowing.
","I've already had one (admittedly even shorter) comment for this rejected by the IMDB, so I'll be brief.  This is without a doubt the most incendiary product to hit the cinema's in well over a decade, possibly even two. 
   Brad Pitt's performance in this film makes me reassert my claim that he is one of the most under-rated actors working in Hollywood today, primarily because of his looks.  Ed Norton is also often overlooked (although not by many on this site)  It's nice to see Helena Bonham-Carter in a drastic change of pace from her usual merchant ivory stuff.   (ASTONISHINGLY MINOR SPOILER AHEAD!)   David Fincher continues his astonishing track record (the abysmal 'The Game' aside) to create a film that will burn itself into your psyche.  As one of the characters says in the film: 'It's like that cut on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tongueing it, but you can't'.   On a side note, I personally think the people who argue about whether the film glorifies violence or condemns it are wasting their time.  It is possible for a film to do neither.  Some films even let you do your own thinking! This is one of them.  If you're looking for propaganda or preaching, there are better examples elsewhere...   This film really deserves a longer review, but since I almost refused to write this one on principle, it'll have to do. Five words: THIS IS BRILLIANT.  SEE IT!",10,0,1,9 April 2001
Kickboxer," Formula stuff for the undemanding.
","There are a hundred other 'martial arts revenge pics' out there, but this is one of the best.  Arrogant guy with about as much (or should that be little?) acting skill as Jean Claude Van Damme gets beaten up and Jean Claude decides to avenge him, being his brother and all.  The music is lovably naff and the scenery is pretty striking.  The villain is also someone you might be conceivably scared of.  There are numerous shots of Van Damme flexing his muscles, and there is also the obligatory love interest. Van Damme, bless his cotton socks, tries to act and fails completely. Still, he's good at what he does best; and that's fighting.  If you're after a 'classic' martial arts movie, I can't imagine you wanting any more than this (apart from perhaps more violence).  Oh, and in case you are wondering, 'Enter the Dragon' is miles better.",5,0,3,21 May 2001
Two for the Money," A tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing much...
","I know that Pacino is a big fan of Shakespeare, so I thought I'd paraphrase old Will there to encapsulate how I felt about this warmed-over assembly of things that any alert audience has seen Al do before.He's one of my favourite actors, but it's hard not to say that some of his choices of late have been extremely lazy. I thought Walter Abrams was exactly like Walter Burke in The Recruit, except - ironically for a movie linked to gambling - the stakes weren't as high by the time he came around to doing it all again in Two for the Money. Unlike many people, I also enjoy the frequent 'shouty' aspects of his method - but come on, just because you're good at being loud doesn't mean you have to play a demagogue over and over again. Vincent Hanna in 'Heat' was often loud, for instance, but he wasn't an overtly controlling, manipulative master of his universe like we see in 'The Devil's Advocate'; 'Any Given Sunday'; 'The Recruit', or indeed here...Not to mention that this movie doesn't even do a very good job of showing an infrequent gambler like myself how the true expert 'has to lose it all just to feel like they're alive'. I don't buy this kind of talk that the movie peddles, at all. It feels too much like conventional wisdom that's been perverted and inverted, to me. I've heard of gamblers being in it for the 'highs and lows', but never for the 'lows and lows'. If that psychology were true, then a punter who loses a ton of money and soon finds themselves living in a cardboard box and eating from a dumpster still wouldn't have a problem. Why?! Because they'd be happy! Yet I've heard tales of lots of gamblers who are desperately unhappy with their lot, find it a miserable experience to lose an amount they can't afford, and would like desperately to rid themselves of this destructive compulsion. If I like something, then I don't want to give it up. It's impossible to feel elated by something and yet want to get rid of it. Contradictory. People who are tempted to take the leap are enslaved by the lure of a big win, which certainly does feel good, but the catch is that something like that comes around all too rarely to have any hope of exerting a positive influence in the long run.That's my logic anyway, and if I'm wrong then the movie doesn't explain its glib philosophies adequately enough to teach me otherwise. All this product trades on is a hypothetical synthetic adrenaline rush delivered by two stars on autopilot, with not a scrap of substance to be found beneath its shiny surface. In short, 'Two for the Money' heralds a payoff that's not worth laying down cold hard cash for.",5,4,5,25 May 2008
Shaun of the Dead," Works as comedy, works as horror. Inspired!
","Praise be! A Britcom from people with TV backgrounds that has an actual STORY rather than playing like a string of sketches... ! The in-jokes and nods to fans of 'Spaced' are there in their hundreds, but can be disregarded altogether without any apparent effect on the 'enjoyment' factor. It really is gratifying to see a film from fairly modest origins so smartly assembled in most departments.It's also pleasing to see aspirations that go beyond the limited confines of its genre. I would classify this as a comedy first and foremost, but what's majorly impressive is that the horror elements are so scarcely the butt of the jokes. It must have been tempting to slide into 'parody' at times, but generally the makers take great pains to avoid that potentially 'lazy' avenue here. It's such a clever meld of genres that it represents the birth of a whole new category - the 'rom-zom-com'!The 'scale' of laughter was gradually progressive, in my case; beginning with wry smiles to small chuckles and on occasion all-out guffaws. This is one of those watches where the whole thing gets more enjoyable as it goes along. The 'small details' I actually often found funnier than the obvious one-liners (witness the corner-shop scene!) I'd call it 'character-comedy' at its best because we get so attached to the principles. It becomes a sort of 'bonding ritual' to laugh at the many foibles that are purposely brought to our attention in the early set-up scenes. By the denouement you'll be rooting for Shaun and his slacker mates to triumph because the depiction of their humdrum lives shattered is probably very much like how it would be in our own cases!If a slogan were to be plucked from this review for the purposes of 'advertising', (I'm open to offers - minimal charge!) I'd have no regrets about being shamelessly cheesy enough to label 'Shaun of the Dead' as being 'The freshest comedy treat of 2004'... !(8/10 or ****/***** in profile ratings system)",8,0,1,29 July 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Provides all the 'booty' you'd expect; sometimes perhaps more, because it may even be a tad overstuffed...
","... I love all the little character moments, but besides that there's whole heaps of plot to cram in, too. I had a nagging sense of doubt for a good portion of the film because it has much more story than its progenitor, and maybe slightly less exhilarating hijinks that seem to arise just for the fun of it. Although such necessary subplots threaten to stall it in some spots, things are threaded together skilfully enough in the end to make me suitably forgiving...Depp's accomplished turn is no surprise, given that this was what had me so hyped up to see it, in the first place... I liked the fact that most of the roles of the returned were expanded, which may account for the length, but on the other hand it's at least trying to be an inclusive experience for both the cast and the audience, alike. The decision to promote Keira to 'one of the lads' was on the money, since she's in possession of a distinctly tomboyish natural charm which now no longer need be concealed. I understand why Orlando is most often stuck being the straight man, since he would no doubt look uncomfortable if asked to be anything but the upright exemplar of a human moral compass.I'm still heartily enthusiastic and on board for the next voyage in under a years time. Mild curiosity - even for casual fans - should be enough to have them exit feeling the same way...",8,2,5,16 July 2006
Rocky V," This one wasn't NEARLY as bad as I'd feared, but a 6th would be beyond the pale...
","... He already tried to pass the torch over, and even a stalwart like Rocky's gotta stop punching above his weight sometime. Just because 'Tommy Gunn' is an unbelievably cack name, doesn't mark this as a total washout, though! Maybe series fans yearned to see Rocky back in the ring, but credit Stallone for trying to go in a different direction. One particular chap making the mistake of complaining about a payoff line is WAY off-base; 'Sue me for what?!' - Well, 'assault', yes; but this completely ignores the relevant point that at this stage there is virtually nothing left of the Balboa estate that is worth going after! This is a film that I believe to be much maligned, as it seems to be very much in keeping with the rest of the series, and serves both as a competent progression and a fitting swansong. However, my words about the prospect of another installment: 'Time's up on this last round, Rock - I just heard the bell!'",6,0,1,21 February 2005
12 Angry Men," '12 Angry Men' is a consistently fascinating film, but one where it's conclusions don't hold up in a lot of modern-day democracies...
","I liked the observation that even juries can become suspicious of one another despite the fact that they're all working toward the same end, and since legal teams are all human they may still be subject to the same propensity to err as the rest of us. There were times however when I disagreed with the influences that brought about the verdict. One of those cornerstones is the notion of 'reasonable doubt'. Clearly this particular principal isn't applied as strenuously as the justice system says it ought to be in all cases that are heard today. My bet is that often these days verdicts are reached by the appeal of common consensus, and any apparent holes are ironed out by majority opinion instead of meriting closer inspection. As one juror says, you can use the counter-argument of 'supposing it happened this way?!' for just about anything. If that is meant to be the clincher that makes adjudicators unsure, then almost nobody would be getting locked away even with lots of admissible evidence stacked up against them.Secondly, unlike on its first general release in 1957, the death penalty is no longer enforced in a heck of a lot of places. In a film where so much of the drama derives from a miscalculation in good faith being enough to condemn an innocent to death, the stakes are no longer quite so high in a lot of territories, which speaks well of the modern age. Now I'm not arguing that wrongful imprisonment is in any way some kind of a picnic, but when you have the facility of a seemingly endless appeals system that can be fully exploited by a canny lawyer, the intricacies of the justice system somehow don't seem quite so immediate or important anymore. We know that sentencing is no longer the final word, because we hear of judgements quashed and rulings overturned virtually every day.... and thirdly, does any ordinary member of the public nowadays really have the confidence to believe that a juror could be so observant to notice marks left by a pair of spectacles?! Many are probably on the verge of dozing off when testimonies are being heard, or at least they would only be listening to the account without having the alertness to take in every minute detail about the personage in front of them, as well. I would think that juries have fallen into a habit of working with details that are overtly given to them by officials, not scrutinising closely enough to allow for consideration of things that they happen to have noticed themselves.Whether or not such idealistic events are indeed credible in these times, '12 Angry Men' is unfailingly, rigorously intelligent in its deconstruction of deliberation. I only wish that in the real world we were without doubt certain to arrive at the proper outcome, so long as we made sure to follow all of the 'rules'...",10,1,2,17 February 2008
The English Patient," I very nearly fell asleep...
","Beautiful locations and performances can do nothing if a film is as soul-destroyingly ponderous as this one is.  One for fans of 'atmos', who have no care if the characters are realistic or even moderately likeable. Were it not for the high calibre of actors on show, the end result would doubtless be even worse to sit through.  Despite the best efforts of Fiennes and Co, I was never far from either sleep or irritation throughout the entire running time.It figures that Oscar should go such a bundle on something like this.  It seemed to me to be all surface 'gloss' and precious little substance.P.S. - Any Brits remember the old 'Turkish Delight' ads on T.V?  Think back to them for a neat encapsulation of the film's good points, with the added blessing that they ran for about 30 seconds instead of 3+ hours!",2,8,16,11 October 2002
The Danish Girl," The Blank Canvas...
","I didn't HATE it, but I really think it could have been told better... To me, the movie wanted the story to have Gerda's perspective, rather than Lili's... The audience is with Gerda every step of the way from when she first encounters Lili as a genuine identity... but we never see Lili find herself, as a child; we're just told about it, and given the explanation that she was 'always there'... I'm sure that's true, but if so, we needed to see it from the beginning - not have our first introduction be a crass 'dressing up' episode with stockings that the character has to embarrassingly retcon later, with a single line of dialogue. It just gives more fuel to the illusion that it's the outside appearance that matters, not the feelings inside... Since it's the first impression we're given, the lie stays imprinted on our minds, despite the denial later. It's GERDA that suggests the stockings, and GERDA that suggests Lili come to the reception, when she first kisses Henrik... We see both of these things, but we don't see Lili first experience life on her OWN terms. That makes everything that subsequently happens to her feel instigated by other people - even if this was actually untrue, and not what the film wished to depict.",6,1,2,28 October 2016
Ted," Every home should have one...
","'Ted' is a film that's filled with ribaldry, and gloriously un-PC pop- culture references... It's also handy that the marketing never made it out to be anything other than 'dumb'... If you were a dissatisfied audience member who was expecting a movie starring a talking teddy bear to be deep, then I don't know what to tell you.I don't think it's a big surprise that people who are huge fans of Family Guy are more likely to enjoy this than those who aren't. Most of Family Guy's jokes are lazy too... but in general they're funny anyway because they're semi-topical and delivered well. Not all humour has to be clever in order to amuse. Maybe there were a few 'Epic Movie' type jokes where a random reference is thrown in for no bigger reason than a surprise laugh, but they were carried off with a lot more style and context than Friedberg & Seltzer manage. Not every joke can be right on target, but I thought that there were more hits than misses, and you soon forget the bad ones if you're laughing at the shots that struck home. A couple of the movie references did annoy me though, being almost shot for shot, and really unimaginative... There was no need to spell out the second 'Aliens' joke, for example - it would have been far funnier for a savvy audience to need to work it out by themselves... but I laughed long and loud at other parts of the movie, so I'm prepared to forgive the odd moment that fell flat. They can't all be winners. Overall it's a fun time at the movies, provided you have an inkling that Macfarlane's style of humour is your cup of tea.",10,0,5,12 September 2012
Spice World," Completely unremarkable in every way, shape and form...
","... but that statement alone immediately makes it superior to any number of 'Wannabe' (Arggghhhh!) Oscar-winners that are actually pretentious cr*p. I know it's a cliche, but this film has a clear idea of its place in the scheme of things, and it knows it's not got a shot of toppling 'Citizen Kane' from the public's affections, so it just sets out to have fun. Whether the audience will be doing the same is a different matter entirely. If you can stomach random sequences strung together with barely an excuse for a plot, and countless jokes that can most kindly be described as of the 'hit & miss' variety, you should be alright.  Hey, if you watch this movie of your own volition and STILL feel you are justified in complaining that it's awful, you deserve everything you get.  Myself, I think it's churlish to overly criticise such a harmless piece of fluff that is obviously desperate to be liked.  So I won't.  It's about as good as could have been reasonably expected.  (There I go, damning it with faint praise!)   Incidentally, of the girls, only Victoria shows the ability to at least deliver a line adequately.  Having said that, don't expect her to be appearing in a Scorsese movie anytime soon (There I go again... !)   We'll just ignore the fact that numerous actors belittle their art in various cameo appearances. (Grant, Hoskins & Cumming, I'm looking at you!) Notice I didn't include Roger Moore in that group.  I didn't think it appropriate.  After all, this is just his level.",5,4,9,10 October 2001
The Natural," Pure, ripe camembert!
","Cheesy whiff? Yep, 'The Natural' oozes it. This is staple 'Roy-of-the-Rovers', winner-in-the-final stuff; except it's about baseball, not soccer (and no, I didn't like it all that much better when it had Sean Bean instead of Redford, was played for 90mins and called 'When Saturday Comes', either!) Of course, there's the obligatory 'doubts' concerning the reality of the film, too; is Robby too old for all this? Let me save you the agonised protracting: Yes, he is; even in his mid-40's; but of course, in the 'magical' world of moving pictures, Redford, with his insouciant charm, might just be capable of leaping tall buildings, with his status as the 'wonderboy' of the baby boomers. Look, it even says so on his bat! ... (sigh)Even the 'golden' guy, with the 'golden' touch and the 'golden' smile is mistaken to think he can save this cliché-fest with his powers. I'll level with ya; as a non-American, baseball is anathema to me, (silly-boys rounders!) but popular legend would have it that Ron Shelton can craft a good sports movie for people who don't like the sport. It's a pity Levinson couldn't do the same for me, because I'm afraid I thought this was a complete strike-out!(3/10, or **/***** in profile ratings system.)",3,10,23,1 September 2004
Dead Poets Society," Dead Students Classroom...
","... Speaking for myself, I don't want to spend a large amount of time in the company of young men who need *permission* to be themselves. If teacher John Keating's role necessitated 'guidance', THEN I could understand, but it doesn't. They all show themselves to have a certain amount of gumption and intelligence outside of the classroom; so why once they get in there are they portrayed as spineless saps who need to be taken by the hand and 'shown the way'?!Keating (Williams) didn't seem to me to have as much effect as I was led to expect and hoped for as I watched. This was more about the boys just being lucky enough to have a role-model standing in front of them who didn't fit societal norms at the time. The kids weren't taught anything much beyond learning how to follow their own instincts, and really, shouldn't fraternising with your peers teach you to do that adequately enough?!It's hard to feel sympathy for people who've got all the raw materials already there; but appear to be so feckless that they need to be *pushed* in order to put them to use! Films that show mentoring the disadvantaged are easier to get behind because you're rooting for the underdogs; there's just no such incentive, in this case. This may be much better made than material like 'Dangerous Minds', but at least in that case there's more 'antagonism' going on underneath the surface...I still enjoyed the film greatly; but making the circumstances of the pupils more sympathetic straight from the get-go would have turned this film into one of my all-time favourites...",7,4,6,27 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Things sure do change when you're up on 'Brokeback Mountain'...
","I have to say what really impressed me the most was the scope of it all. I expected it to focus by and large on the immediate aftermath of Jack and Ennis' first coupling, but to my welcome surprise the whole film had a real sweeping, epic quality to it. When the bond that they shared survives such change in their circumstances it made the whole tale that much more evocative. It shows that regardless of your gender or your approach to relationships, love is like a tick that gets under your skin and won't ever stop affecting your mental processes throughout all of your time on earth (and don't I know that that sure is the truth... !!)Helping to emphasize these developments is some gorgeously languid direction by Lee - his camera seeming to caress the landscape he films - and also a wonderfully subtle turn from Ledger, especially. This shows Heath in a different light to any of his other films, and if he can transform himself this well, then maybe he isn't as much of a risk as I thought for Nolan's 'Joker', after all!I don't feel qualified to say whether it was the best picture of its year, but I certainly thought that it was braver and more emotionally genuine than 'Crash'. If you're anybody who's going to give 'Brokeback... ' a shot (and I suggest that everyone does) my advice is not to concentrate on its differences, but to instead take a clearer look at the smaller intimate details that can bring us all closer together if only we choose to let them.",8,24,27,23 February 2007
About Time," Wasted Time...
","None of the romantic situations seem at all genuine Give a stranger at a gallery your full address? Sure! Ask your girlfriend to eat dinner alone so you can dine with a guy you've already turned down once? Why not? Propose marriage to your girlfriend when she's half-asleep, even though you could easily wait until morning? Great idea! None of this would ever happen. I know it's a romantic comedy and these things are built on whimsy - but it's extremely difficult to identify with likable characters if you feel like nothing they ever experience would occur outside of a movie It's too cosily scripted from minute one, and fantasy should entail dreaming about things that could actually happen, not imagining a whole new alternate reality! If there are flaws with the romance, then it makes the family stuff harder to take seriously, too, since the problem is with the root, and not the branch... The time travel was the easiest element of the movie for me to accept, it was all the stuff around it that I found hard to credit!",5,7,16,19 July 2014
L.A. Confidential," Brilliant.
","I'm not going to launch into an in-depth analysis of the film (Lord knows I had to do enough of that to get an A-level in Media) Suffice to say this is one of the best films the 90's has produced; an achievement made all the more remarkable considering the complex source material. I admire Hanson and Helgeland for fashioning a taut and relatively easy to understand thriller without sacrificing too many of the nuances that make Ellroy's books great (Incidentally, if you're into good reading, I recommend 'The Black Dahlia') I had to watch this film multiple times daily for a year and not once did I get sick of it. That's a high recommendation!Oh, BTW, Helgeland also wrote the screenplay for one of the massively inferior 'Elm Street' sequels. From little acorns do mighty oak trees grow.",10,2,4,1 April 2001

The Day After Tomorrow," Nature is no respecter of feelings...
","... or for that matter, relationships; nor it seems, logic! This isn't meant to be as harsh a criticism as it possibly sounds. The shortcomings in logic are most easily dismissed - the movie was meant to be nothing more than an impressive CGI spectacle, so the fact that resorting to the 'fantastical' is sometimes too easy for the makers to resist should come as no surprise. Ordinarily though, I'd find myself a little peeved when a movie also prefers to skimp on the verisimilitude of emotional drama. Strangely enough, however, this time that didn't harm my goodwill toward TDAT.With such a shortened timescale as the film (again) erroneously presents, emotions may well be condensed and virtual strangers could easily find themselves compelled to behave as if they'd known each other their whole lives - in the context of events, these four days ARE their entire lives!My only real complaints were that I felt the relationship between father and son wasn't really established well enough for it to later become the emotional fulcrum of the picture. This isn't a slight upon the performances of Quaid and Gyllenhaal, for they are fine - but if it's decided that mere human oiks are going to be secondary to dwelling on destruction wreaked by the elements, then don't try to manipulate our sympathies for them by the end of the disaster! Similarly, the characters alternately get a little corny/triumphalist at the denouement; something I found hard to stomach given that footage which stems from mankind's ignorance is lingered over lovingly by Emmerich regardless. Still, who expected Hollywood to have a sound ecological conscience? Not me, and despite the contradictions between 'this could really happen!' versus severe artistic license to make it more entertaining, this still remains a decent enough time.",6,1,1,8 June 2004
The Terminator," Back From the Future...
","If you want science-fiction that pores over the complications of time travel, then good for you. I'm perfectly happy with the stripped down race-for-life element of the plot which pits two sympathetic good eggs against a monolithic hulk of a structure that just keeps on coming. For Sarah Conner it's just an outlandish nightmare that won't end, and she goes through an understandable range of emotions: hysteria, incredulity, anger and affection for her protector before reaching down inside herself and finding the resolve to end her ordeal. Underscoring the two runaways enforced adjustment to their situation is Brad Fiedel's brilliantly relentless theme.It's set in a far darker, more nihilistic environment than its big budget sequel, and I much prefer the hopelessness that the atmospheric premise trades on so well.",10,0,1,16 June 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A couple of 'iconic' elements have hoodwinked the majority into calling this a great film...
","... but so far as I could see; the ONE great scene has been shown on Oscar telecasts too many times for it to rescue an enterprise that's otherwise so lazy. Yes; Newman and Redford are accomplished, but I wouldn't have expected anything less from them - What I would have expected from the film is a solid 'backstory' for our characters, and a sense of urgency from the narrative; instead of the constant feeling that we're supposed to nudge each other and laugh as our lackadaisical heroes amble their way through life. Burt Bacarach may have crafted a good tune; but that doesn't excuse what felt like an eternity wasted watching Newman ride a bicycle... He's a great actor; but even HE can't enliven a moment so mundane.The admittedly memorable ending wouldn't serve as 'too little, too late' had the movie earned it's 'veneration' of these two unexceptional vagabonds; but the movie failed to convince me over its running time that these chaps were in any way 'special'. You wonder if those who think it's a 'classic' just framed the last ten seconds of film in their minds, and somehow passed over the aimless episodes that served as buildup to the 'climax'? I'll tell you something: I wish I could have such selective perception; but no, I unfortunately remember ALL those other limp moments that went before the ending, as well... !",4,11,27,7 September 2005

Right down to the blatent shoehorning of Madonna's 'Lucky Star' onto the soundtrack simply because of the well-known connection, his only abilities seem to lie in bombarding the audience with the obvious at every turn.

The Bodyguard," He's got her covered.
","Two professionals of different kinds. One who has to cultivate an outgoing and accessible air because that's how she makes her living, and one who keeps his emotions in and tries wherever possible to stay in the background as part of his. Mutual attraction will place limits on both of their lives - if they manage to stay safe for long enough, that is...Costner is well-suited to playing the stoic and intense action man, and casting Whitney Houston as a singer allows her a fairly comfortable start in the movies. They make an appealing enough couple and their chemistry together is of the simmering type. Some have criticised the leading female, but I believe her underplaying works well enough that we can glimpse a vulnerable dimension to her character.The whole thing seems content to serve as a glossy potboiler for the shameless romantic - and help to shift millions of soundtrack units along the way, of course. It's something of an easy sell, I suppose, but I'm still left admiring how it's packaged. A triple handkerchief affair for some females, no doubt, but it's flashy enough in certain spots to be of moderate interest to the guys too. Cross-gender appeal is what Hollywood strives for, and they hit upon a smooth and stylish blend here.",7,5,10,9 August 2007
Alien," A lesson in suspense...
","With 'Alien', Ridley Scott delivered one of the most inventive and atmospheric chillers of modern cinema.   What makes it a classic?  A good script always helps, and this is a cast that refreshingly consists of 'actors' rather than big name stars who can't turn in a performance.  The fact that the principal crew is relatively small also helps because you feel a real sense of loss when one of them is offed. It makes a nice change from horror/monster movies where the hunter has a seemingly indefinite supply of prey to terrorise.   The sets really are pretty cool for a movie made so long ago, and the director exploits the dramatic potential that such a setting provides. There are plenty of shadowy nooks and crannies for the alien to conceal itself in. and Scott knows how to build up the tension gradually, resisting the temptation to rush any encounters with the creature and thus spoil the unsettling mood.   (SPOILERS)   The chest-bursting scene must be one of the most shocking and brilliantly conceived moments in film.  The fact that the alien disappears soon after we see it at this point gives us a chance to absorb what's just happened and to take in the horrified reaction of the crew.  Wonderful.   As mentioned before, the cast are uniformly excellent, with particular standouts being Holm and Weaver.  In Ripley we have a character who just happens to be female and is not a woman because such a decision makes a difference to the actual story (gratuitous vest & knickers scene towards the end excluded)  Weaver is excellent, clearly relishing at the idea of a strong female part, and showing off her talents accordingly.  If it wasn't the money that tempted her back for a fourth time in 'Ressurection', it was perhaps the mistaken belief that Ripley was still a strong character, instead of the gimmick the studio had by then made her.  I can easily tell people who my favourite actors are, but when the same is asked of actresses I struggle; NOT because there are no good ones out there, but because they are rarely given the roles to shine.  Show me a Hollywood actress with a consistently good (and high profile) body of work.  I'm tempted to cite Sigourney as my favourite actress on the strength of the first three Alien movies alone, but she's rarely had a role as good as Ripley since 'Aliens'   I marginally prefer the all-action sequel to this, but it's a close call. This takes a fairly unoriginal idea and exploits every last drop of tension from it until the climax.  The movie will leave you sweating.  Great stuff.",9,1,2,8 March 2001

Malcolm X," The under-appreciated power of 'balance'.
","Disappointingly I felt, the majority of this film is devoted to the time of his life when Malcolm X was self-admittedly in error. In later years he was an inspirational man, but I spent most of the film hating him and the aggressive ideals he adopted for so long before his eventual renunciation. Unfortunately it seemed Lee was more interested in his dubious activities, instead of giving equal weight to BOTH sides of such a complex character.I understand that 'length' would have been a concern in evaluating this, but here is where I think Lee and his editor could have been more judicious in selecting crucial points of emphasis. They were certainly different men in a lot of ways, but in 'Ali' I think Michael Mann did a much better job of capturing the overall essence of a person by zeroing in on pivotal moments and excising as much of what could be thought 'supplementary material' as possible. I still gave grudging respect to the composition even at times when I was dissatisfied with the path taken, though, because undeniably the scenes are exceptionally well-realised and blended together, throughout.If Spike had tried to balance it out and given more of the running time to Malcolm's conciliatory efforts then I would most likely be saying it was a masterpiece and calling it an honest and just portrait. When such a large amount of coverage is devoted to an 'unsavoury' element, it makes it seem almost as if 'extremism' is what we should most remember the man for. It isn't. I bitterly regret that what we were handed does not represent the 'even spread' that it should have.",7,3,9,2 August 2006
Over the Top," OVER THE TOP DIALOGUE - literally!
","Is this a contender for movie-with-the-worst-dialogue-ever???!Some examples: 1. 'I drive trucks, break arms, and arm wrestle. It's what I love to do, it's what I do best'.2. 'Tell you the truth, the truck is, uh, you know, the most important thing for me. I... I don't really... it doesn't matter if I, uh, become the champion or anything. That's, that's not the most important... I... I need this truck'.Such funny writing, in my opinion, that it belongs in a spoof along the lines of 'Zoolander'... Hey, that's my next idea!! I have watched it, and I know I'm taking those quotes out of context, but I still maintain it's incredibly poor scripting. Dialogue shouldn't just literally 'spell out' a character's motivations all the time. A halfway-perceptive movie audience must surely have heard of 'subtext', even if the writers of this movie apparently haven't... ?! (I can't believe I just mentioned 'subtext' in reference to a Stallone arm-wrestling movie, but still... !)Maybe the words and phrasing 'totally fit the characters' - but that only goes to show that these guys we're supposed to believe are real people are actually nothing more than grossly-inflated caricatures...'Rocky' and 'Rambo' lodged in the public consciousness because, initially at least, they were multi-faceted and not sketched in the broad strokes of cartoons. Somewhere around 1985, when Sly was really being trusted with properties that were commissioned solely to be Stallone vehicles, he lost whatever traces of subtlety his career might once have started out with. Then only self parody and a restaurant venture barely managed to keep his head above water, until both 'Demolition Man' and 'Cliffhanger' heralded a slight return to early form. 'Over The Top' is a relic from the dark ages of the mid 80's. Without these kinds of eyesores on his CV, who knows what position he would be in now; he mightn't have gotten trapped in the cycle of dragging his most famous alter-egos back for a late return...",3,2,5,12 July 2007
Full Metal Jacket," Worth it just for the 'boot camp' section... (MINOR SPOILERS)
","...The second half is, admittedly, not quite as purely entertaining, but who ever said war WAS entertaining in the first place?  The most gritty and accurate war film I've seen, knocking the highly over-rated 'Platoon' squarely into a cocked hat, in my opinion.  This IS a Kubrick film, so expect everything that's in there to have been included for a clearly defined reason.  Several moments in this film border on genius, including the absurdly funny but somehow horrific head shaving sequence that opens the film, backed by an appropriate track I can't at this moment remember the name of.  Good performances by all, especially D'onofrio and Ermey.  Kubrick managed to tackle almost every genre available,  this is his war effort, and it's a cracker.  Don't miss it.",9,0,0,12 March 2001
Forrest Gump," I can see why people might dislike this film, but...
","... I gotta say, I love it!  Whether you agree with me will probably depend on whether the whimsical tone of the film is likely to make you want to smile or puke.  As I said, I'm in the former camp, but I can well understand anybody who disagrees.  This film is certainly a devisive topic amongst my friends and I, faintly dodgy politics and all (more on that later...)Before I offer my critique of the film, I just wanna touch on two issues that are vaguely related.  Firstly, the IMDB lists 'The Deer Hunter' as a recommendation to those who like this movie.  What??  Let me assure you, two more movies that are so totally different as these pair would be hard to find.  There is a VERY tenuous possible link with Vietnam, but aside from that we're dealin' with chalk and cheese.  I recommend cinema and/or De Niro buffs check out 'TDH' for completist sakes, because it's good, but IMHO vastly over-rated (I know people will say the same about 'Forrest Gump'!). Anyhow, the tone of the two films is completely different, so in my estimation a slight error within the IMDB there...Secondly, I know people complain because there was a crop of other good movies to get a Best Picture nod in '94, and 'Gump' beat them to it. Most - if not all - of the films nominated that year would have been deserving winners.  It just so happened that the Academy plumped for Gump (sorry about the excruciating rhyme...)  This does not devalue Forrest Gump against the more dramatic pictures any more then it reflects badly on the runners up. It was just a very good period for film, and all us cinema fans should be thankful for that...Now that I've got that off my chest, back to the film in question.  I feel that Hanks' performance stays just on the right side of cloying sentimentality, always threatening to tip over the edge, but never quite doing so.  This must be testament to Hanks skill as an actor, as with many other actors in the role the character could have become fiercely irritating during the lengthly running time.  Again, I'm well aware of the arguments that say the character was annoying from the START, but I never felt that to be the case.An able supporting cast serve to back up Hanks, and there is a wonderful turn from Gary Sinise as 'Lt Dan Taylor'.  His character ALMOST threatens to inject some edge into the character's ultra-PC universe, but maybe that reflects the fact that the other characters are so wholesome rather than that he is nasty.(SPOILERS)It's a fun jaunt through some 40 years (I think...) of history, refreshingly not confined entirely to American culture.  John Lennon makes an 'appearance' at one stage (You could argue that he represents 'cross-culture', but I'm claiming him as one of our own, even though I'm not a Scouser but a Manc).  To those who think part of the fun in watching a movie is predicting events, this one won't provide you with much of a challenge.  I recommend sitting back and allowing yourself to be drawn into the movie universe.As other users have pointed out before me, the film can possibly be seen as having a 'reactionary' viewpoint.  Having the main female character die of AIDS as a consequence of her earlier hedonist actions seems depressingly intolerant if it was intended to convey some sort of message to the audience.  I have no idea if events in the book are the same.  For those of you looking for deep subtextual material, it's certainly a juicy bone of contention, but the film can be enjoyed just as well on a purely simplistic level.  I don't think the political bias is strong enough to ruin the film. As for my view on whether any such connotation was deliberate, let's just say it wouldn't surprise me...(SPOILER END)To close, many of my friends voice much the same objections about the film that I have seen on this site.  If the potential for nostalgia combined with goofy fantasy doesn't sound like it will be your thing, then by all means avoid.  If, however, the concoction I have described sounds suited to your tastes, then enjoy; because I guarantee you won't find many better examples of this type of thing around.",9,1,2,20 March 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," Light, enjoyable fare that proves animation is still on top...
","... when it comes to producing well-rounded, realised and consistently entertaining movies.  Is it just me or have there been no REALLY awful animated films from the stables of the top studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, etc?  The movie industry as a whole should perhaps sit up and take notice of the craft that goes into these movies.  Both 'suits' and audiences are sure to benefit if that ever happens.  Long may the tradition of quality animated movies be, I say!   I actually bought a ticket for this last night after finding to my dismay that another premiere, 'From Hell', was already sold out by the time I arrived.  These are certainly two distinctly different films in theme!  I was slightly grouchy, because, coupled with that minor disappointment, I'd had an argument with a friend on the way over to the theatre, and was now proceeding solo.  I wouldn't say that 'Monsters Inc' made me glad I missed 'From Hell', but I still got a solidly entertaining film for my money.  I just hope I don't miss 'Ocean's 11' next week...   For every plus-point to the movie I can also think of a criticism, but on the whole the good points JUST outweigh the bad.  The setup may be a little too complicated for younger audiences and the supporting cast of voices is wasted.  There was definitely not enough Steve Buscemi, whose bad guy just seemed like an afterthought to all the Keystone Cops esque capers of trying to get 'Boo' out of Monstropolis.  The script is pitched at a much younger level than 'Toy Story' was, and so as a result adults may be bowled over by the animation, but slightly starved in the belly-laughs department.  That said, there are still a couple of moments guaranteed to have older patrons guffawing heartily, just not enough for my liking.  Even without laughter, the story is still diverting and inventive enough to fix your attention satisfactorily.  The movie really comes into its own when the kid is introduced, as thereafter the action rarely pauses for breath.   Good as the voice talents of Goodman and Crystal are, it is undoubtedly youngster Mary Gibbs who inadvertently steals the show.  Her cute gurgles and shrieks are enough to put a smile on most people's faces and warm their hearts.  The job the team did on collecting all her voice samples for the finished movie is nothing short of amazing; indeed, just like the animation achievements were as well.  Goodman excels in his voice acting, making 'Sulley' a truly memorable character.   The animation is wonderful, and at times will make you unable to do anything else but gawp.  Techniques in this arena seem to be moving at lightspeed, and in just a few years will make the graphics seen in 'Toy Story' seem unremarkable.  Just for this factor alone, 'Monsters Inc.' deserves to be seen, but the likeable (if not always best used) cast and the imaginative plot add an extra dimension that make it worth your time. Nowhere near a 'Toy Story' beater for sheer polish and appeal to all ages, but a commendable effort nonetheless.  Well done!

Bridget Jones's Diary," Good, but if you've seen 1 Brit rom-com, then you've seen 'em all...
","Movies like this always seem to follow a set formula, and most of them star Hugh Grant!: Loveable idiosyncratic loser has a series of mishaps before finding their perfect 'dream partner' and settling down happily ever after.  Yes, I know that applies to a lot of American ones as well, but there's something so quintessentially BRITISH about it by definition, right down to the wandering American star who appears in the film apropos of nothing... All of which isn't intended to suggest that 'BJD' is a bad film.  It's quite the opposite in fact, it's just that this particular sub-genre has been so well MINED by Brit production companies that its in danger of becoming a target for parody before too long, much as 'Scary Movie' did with the 'Scream' series.   Honestly, if this is your sort of thing then watch it, because it's not bad at all.  I just suspect that I'll be growing a little weary when I hear the phrase 'This year's Bridget Jones' Diary' trumpeted loudly about the British Film Industry's 'Great White Hope' for 2003.  It's got a grim sense of inevitability about it, it really has...",7,0,0,18 November 2002
Predator," The Hunters Become the Hunted.
","'Predator' stands as probably the finest exponent of testosterone-fuelled action cinema. Within the first five minutes, we get the usual close-ups of Arnie so that the audience can gape at how big his muscles are. Soon he's backed up by a team of assorted other tough hombres, but together are even they ferocious enough to take on a heat-seeking alien head to head? Let's just say they give it their best shot, but more than brawn is needed to outwit this creature...What saves this movie from devolving into your standard 'stalk n slash' is both the directing and Stan Winston's input into creating a fearsome nemesis for these macho men. By the clever design of those involved in the creative process, you actually feel genuinely scared for these guys, despite the largely menacing and hulking figures that they appear to be. If a foe can vanquish tooled up commandos with ease, then it's clearly a force to be reckoned with!If you want to see a thrilling movie where for one of the only times, the hero and villain seem well-matched, then you must track 'Predator'...",8,1,2,15 July 2007
The Caine Mutiny," Man going overboard...
","One thing it's really good to see is Humphrey Bogart showing his range and giving a truly vulnerable performance. Cynicism is usually the protective armour of a Bogie character, but in Queeg we have the opposite of a cynic - a man so obsessed with doing even trivial things by the book that his underlings decide he is no longer fit for his job. To understand and embrace routine is obviously necessary in military life, but this rigid adherence ultimately becomes a distraction from performing his necessary duties. It's a perfect showcase for how the pressure-cooker atmosphere of always living with the threat of war can make otherwise tough men crumble.It's a subtle show from Bogart, his demonstration of illness encompassing a number of tics which get worse as he starts to unravel from being judged up there on the stand. It's a cleverly escalating portrait, and the film never feels rushed, but for me the story started to get less interesting once everybody entered the courtroom. I generally don't like legal dramas, because out of necessity the focus becomes more on the mechanics of the plot than getting to examine human personalities. This is just a personal preference, however, and if you're a person who combines an admiration for Humphrey Bogart with a passion for the technicalities of the law, then I don't see how you could go far wrong in selecting 'The Caine Mutiny'.",5,11,17,21 April 2007
Footloose," Unfair reputation.
","Prior to seeing this movie, all I had heard suggested that I was better off not watching it unless it was to ridicule. I looked at my uncle dancing round his living room to some of its music and asked myself if anybody expected me to take that seriously. It's got a place in movie history even for the title song alone, though, so I decided I couldn't live with myself unless I gave it a chance. It was definitely worth it.The style is reminiscent of a whole host of other '80's teen flicks, but only a handful are better. Most of the cast do great things with their roles. Kevin Bacon actually manages to make the clichÃ©d concept seem kinda cool, here showcasing an easy charm that was to become the hallmark of much of his later work. Crucially, the music is actually pretty good too! (Even if I am torn between wanting to cringe and dance when I hear the theme!)On reflection it's no cheesier than something like 'All the Right Moves' (which has a great cast doing their best but suffers from a plodding story) In fact, it's miles better! At least the music in 'Footloose' gave the makers a viable way to pep things up whenever the story begins to flag. This film is much, MUCH better than I had been led to believe, so give it a chance if you ain't seen it yet but thought you knew the score. Chances are, you don't...",7,98,133,19 November 2002
Armageddon," The End of Subtlety...
","There are few films that come under more attack from movie elitists than 'Armageddon'. 'It's loud! Boorish! Jingoistic! Empty-headed!', they sneer contemptuously. All of the naysayers are of course exactly right. It is all of these things and more tactless synonyms besides. If you take every one of these criticisms into account, however, and nevertheless make a conscious effort to approach the film in the right frame of mind, then I still maintain you can have a lot of fun with its blunt attitude.It's an overblown comic-book tailor made for teenagers and grown up kids, alike. Embrace it's sheer ridiculousness; chomp popcorn and grip your seat in synch with the deafening musical cues that are helpfully provided. It's meant to be an assault on your senses and nerves, just like the wildest ride in an amusement park. Logic doesn't enter into the exercise, and nor should it, either. This is a slam-bang experience, and Michael Bay is your consummate purveyor for these types of things. I ask those who would still gripe fruitlessly: What the heck else should you be expecting????!!!Sometimes you have to learn to appreciate 'big and dumb' if it's 'big and dumb' that's at least aiming for mass appeal. This is absolute populist entertainment for better or worse. Try to enjoy it, otherwise you might as well never go outside again, if it offends your delicate sensibilities too much...",8,2,5,29 November 2007
American Psycho," The majority of those who complain probably haven't read the book...
","... because with 'American Psycho', Mary Harron and her screen writing partner have delivered the most faithful adaptation it would be possible to release without getting the film banned or revolting audiences so much that no one comes to see it. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to take some of the most extreme sequences from the book and commit them to film. What the movie instead does is to give us an insight into the stunningly fragile and insecure mind of Patrick Bateman, and to speculate whether his unstable nature would REALLY lead him to perpetrate vile acts, or whether he just fantasises about doing so.I think it matters little in the context of this film whether Bateman's exploits are actually based in reality, because whether they are or they aren't, Bateman is still left in the grip of paranoia, brought on by the shallowness of the society that is around him. Bateman is less of a 'psycho' than a vessel for all the selfish evils of society to corrupt, and a sensible audience is more likely to be left reeling at how he has been turned into a 'robot', than by the discreet amounts of gore that do feature in the movie.'American Psycho' is fascinating to watch because Bateman is such a complex character. We feel revulsion at his violent tendencies, amused by his complete superficiality, and pity at his crumbling sanity. In order to evoke such diverse feelings from one performance, we need a superb actor. Bale's performance is right on the money. Never does HIS mask slip as does that of Patrick Bateman. He is completely believable in all his emotions.There is NOTHING in the film that is not true to the book (although there are bits in the book that are not true to the film) Both the reading and watching experiences are valuable and rewarding ones, but what they share with each other is that while they're exploring somebody else's mental state, they are also probing that of their audience. Can we see the funny side in the fact that these murders were committed for very trivial reasons?Can we ridicule someone with the knowledge that he is also a fantastically dangerous person? The film and book are constantly pushing boundaries, and if you don't fight that, but instead surrender to it, they will take you to many interesting places. Don't be afraid to give in to your emotions and laugh when you see something funny, because the movie shows us what emotional repression has done to someone like Patrick.Kudos to Mary Harron for tackling a seriously difficult project and turning it into one of the cleverest movies of recent years. 'American Psycho' is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is: Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you...",8,332,466,12 April 2002
Little Miss Sunshine," Light up your life... !
","If you want a feel-good story that never gets schmaltzy, then 'Little Miss Sunshine' turns out to be a great pick. It boasts a positive denouement that argues courage is a more important thing to have in your armoury than credentials. If you've never felt that you measure up, then this movie welcomes you and asks you to take heart in the fact that there's bound to be one area where you excel.It's a message that in my opinion is delivered with much greater aplomb than something like 'Napolean Dynamite' - another 'outsider' paean - for example, because it doesn't feel stilted. These people are unabashed about their foibles and won't accept marginalisation because of them. This is a story that isn't afraid to let it all hang out when it comes to personal character quirks that could potentially be awkward. Each member of the family has uncomfortable flaws that aren't shied away from, and yet somehow against all the odds they are able to pull together and function as a successful family unit when it gets down to crunch time. Whereas Napolean almost seemed content to spend most of his time on the sidelines, 'Little Miss... ' has all of its principals make the brave decision to get right into the thick of things.If you yourself feel like a 'superfreak', then watching this allows you a private moment to rejoice. You've finally found a place in the sunshine where you belong!",8,1,4,1 November 2007
The Shining," Whether you want black comedy or horror, Kubrick delivers it all with this one.
","... This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing ('five months of peace is just what I want... ') and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines...",10,21,35,1 June 2007
American Beauty," Superbly crafted.
","The puzzling thing about this film for me is that no single scene will make you think 'That was great'.  Instead, after a few moments reflection when the credits roll, you'll probably find yourself thinking, as I did, that you've just seen a great film.   (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)   IMO, the film deserved its Oscars.  I don't think the film offers us ANYTHING we haven't seen before, to a greater or lesser degree, but I think that is the film's strength.  In the characters and the way they act we see so much of ourselves, our frustrations made public and our inner desires laid bare.  We've seen all of this before in good movies and the people we know intimately because it relates to US, in the way only the best movies and the most honest people can.  Where I feel it differs from other movies that explore similar themes (I know they're out there, I just can't think of a particular example at the moment!) is this:  In satire it is all too easy to take a broad swipe at the obvious targets. The disenchanted middle-aged, for example (man or woman), without really digging under the surface and exposing what might perhaps make us a little uncomfortable.  So you get the middle aged man, but you don't get him attempting to act on his desire for his teenaged daughter's best friend;  OH NO! that would be too controversial and be sending out the wrong message! What the makers of 'American Beauty' seem to understand is that a toothless satire just doesn't work, you need to have the courage to take your exposure to the very limits, or you shouldn't bother trying at all.  'American Beauty', thankfully, doesn't pull its punches when showing the audience what life is REALLY like.  The tone is also consistent throughout, which means it doesn't fall flat on its face by turning its characters into caricatures half way through.   This is down, in some way, to the script, but also to the beautifully judged performances delivered by all the cast.  I think it would be deeply unfair to single out any one individual for special praise.  Suffice to say that Kevin Spacey is a superb actor, as most would agree, and not even the less experienced members of the cast (Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari) look out of place acting opposite him.   One thing I don't understand though:  WHAT is so profound about a plastic bag blowing in the wind?  I look hard, and I don't see a symbol of life's beauty/fragility, I just see litter!  Greenpeace must be fuming about this...  In all seriousness, though, it strikes me as one of the only false notes in the movie.  It really is quite trite, and seems to be at odds with the subtlety displayed in the rest of the film.  The characters themselves have done a perfectly good job of emphasising that sometimes we have to look closer to see real beauty, the point doesn't need to be laboured by such a blatant attempt at emotional manipulation.  After all, it IS JUST a plastic bag!   Dubious attempt to use a device for transporting shopping as a hamfisted metaphor aside, this really IS a great film.  The 90's has had its fair share of classic cinema, this is definitely one such example.",9,0,0,17 March 2001
Apocalypse Now," A descent into madness...
","Masterful. How do you tell who's sane and who isn't when the troops and the officials are all in the war for the wrong reasons? It's a giant cover-up, like the whole affair tried to be and should have been, for the good of the ordinary person's conscience. It's not a movie, it's an experience. They weren't just goofing off in front of the camera, they lived this; and the arduous shoot became a reference point for future troubled productions. The sacrifices were worth it, though; because the end results are nothing short of stunning...I never understood all the hype around Marlon Brando before I saw this. In 'The Godfather' he didn't seem to be stretching himself; but he blew me away here. He's not alone; as an acclaimed cast and director joined together to make not just the finest Vietnam movie ever made; but a work that is easily one of the best films of all time, in its own right.",10,3,3,8 November 2005
Van Helsing," How anyone can hate a film with such good humour and a sense of fun is beyond me.
","I can certainly reconcile myself with someone's DISLIKE of the film, and I would expect such people not to view if they have a good idea beforehand that this won't light their fire; but I can't understand those who claim to love this type of genre before watching who then precede to rip the film to shreds.  The good humour mentioned in my summary isn't represented by a particular sharpness of script or a reliance on slapstick, but rather a general attitude pervading the film which smacks of those involved having a darn good time.  In the case of director Sommers this manifests itself often in a threatened overdose of CGI, but when the effects are this good such profligacy where they're concerned is hardly a problem.   The manifesto is clear almost from the start - find a wafer-thin premise with which to allot your ghouls enough screen time and then just let them loose in a suitably gothic arena.  As such, Jackman's Van Helsing often finds himself relegated to the role of a bystander, so perhaps the fact that the film bears his name is a bit of a misnomer; however, like I said, we're pretty much in contrivance territory as far as 'plot development' goes, so it should be seen as just another brand name to hang a silly hat on.  In this regard it may pain Jackman the most, since it leaves him still searching for a leading man role in the style of Crowe's 'Gladiator' to really leave his print indelibly ('X-Men' is an ensemble piece.)  His best moment actually comes before the main brawls begin - testing out various items of weaponary Inspector Gadget stylee!   The lack of focus on the main character shouldn't perturb the audience too much though; if they prepare themselves for a monster royal rumble in the grandest tradition then they should find themselves leaving well satisfied.",7,1,2,7 June 2004
Rocky IV," I realise that it defies all reason, but this is my favourite in the series... (SPOILERS)
","Subtlety and plausibility are entirely absent here, but to me this film remains the most entertaining in the 'Rocky' series.  Whether it be the death of Apollo Creed in the exhibition match, the training sequence filled with great music, or the climactic final fight, the film is unashamedly bombastic and carries me through its running time on a tide of euphoria that makes me ignore the silliness of it all.  Dolph Lundgren makes a great villain, and it's only the final five minutes of breast-beating from one of 'America's favourite fictional sons' - TM - that becomes almost too hard to take.  The very idea that a hostile Russian crowd could be won over by someone showing a little guts is preposterous.  Much like the whole movie, in fact; but I don't care, I like it!",7,1,1,28 September 2001
In the Name of the Father," Stunning.
","Words cannot accurately describe how affecting this movie is.   The story itself is harrowing, but the way in which Day Lewis portrays Gerry Conlon is heartbreaking at times.  Several scenes in the film may be hard to take for those with a sensitive nature.   Captures the mood and the time perfectly for someone like me, who is not Irish, lives nowhere near Guildford and wasn't even alive at the time of the pub bombings.   I really wasn't expecting anything special when I sat down to watch this. I could not have been more wrong.   The soundtrack is great without exception too!

The Amazing Spider-Man," It's more difficult to be 'Amazed' by certain things you've seen before...
","... but, other than that bit of false advertising, I'd still say that this was a solid enough first step down a new avenue.* Better acting (in my opinion)* It shows more of his childhood, and how he's raised.* There's more focus on the web-slinging, acrobatic side of things... The costume has been changed so that Spidey appears more streamlined... I approve of this alteration. Raimi's SM hangs together better in terms of story, but TASM had better individual moments. They're all worthy films, in my opinion... It's just a little bit of a shame that they were made so close together.",10,5,12,18 July 2012
Aliens," 'Dirty Dozen' in space, with added spots of sensitivity...
","A different feel to its predecessor, but no less effective.(SPOILERS)   Weaver is again impressive as Ripley, she convincingly portrays a woman who is scarred by her experiences but willing to relive them for the sake of humanity.  The little girl, Newt, represents the hope we have for the human race and I think that's why a lot of purists were outraged at her not returning for pt 3.  Probably my favourite scene in the movie is where Ripley tries to placate Hudson by telling him that Newt managed to survive against the aliens.  His whiny 'So why'nt you put her in charge? and her smart little salute is perfectly played.   This relationship between Newt and Ripley is where the film gets the sensitivity I mentioned from.  Aside from that, it's pretty much action all the way, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  I believe Cameron is the greatest living action director (Yes, Tarantino and Woo included. but I said ACTION remember? I didn't say he was altogether a better director than Quentin) and he has fun with the possibilities the film raises.  The Marines are all likeable, even to the point where you might LIKE to dislike the Hudson character.  Biehn basically does the same role as the earlier 'Terminator' (You tell me that Hicks and Kyle Reese aren't the same character!)  No time for character development here, we got showdowns to stage!  Macho one-liners are present for the testosterone fueled amongst you, and the females in the audience will probably be there because of their fondness for the original.     The most important thing is: hardly anyone will come away disappointed. This is a sequel that doesn't desecrate the original, but instead just wisely does everything on a bigger scale.  A classic that deserves to sit proudly alongside 'Alien'.",10,1,2,8 March 2001
The Exorcist," I can see why all the fuss was made...
","If we're talking 'modern classic films', then this nearly always gets a mention, and I can see why. Strip away all the hype of the 'Best Film/Scariest Film Ever' variety and you are still left with a brilliant film. Beautifully directed and acted, this is just a great film whether you see it expecting to be scared out of your wits or just out of curiosity. I might venture to suggest that it's lost some of its impact since its original release (probably why I didn't give it top marks) but then cinema and society in general has progressed (some would say regressed) in that time. I still felt vaguely unsettled after watching it; and believe me, in these days when modern horror is often nothing but artifice, that's a compliment. An imperious film.",9,1,2,10 May 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Ocean's eleven are an entertaining bunch... (DEFINITELY SPOILAGE... )
","... as, for that matter, are guys like Elliot Gould's decadent mentor and Andy Garcia's ruthless casino boss. Every (male) member of the cast comes together to contribute tellingly to a very entertaining movie. Okay, there are flaws; Don Cheadle's Cockney accent is needless and inconsistent, and the character of Tess Ocean takes a backseat to the boys schemes, but these minor quibbles don't prevent enjoyment in watching an audacious job so slickly executed. For both the central conceit and the movie itself could have proved to be nothing more than a daring folly committed by people with ideas above their station. Thankfully, in both cases everything goes off without a hitch, and the result is a fun watch.There is little to be said about the two considered 'leads' of the movie.Both Clooney and Pitt are rarely dull in their on screen endeavours, and this is no exception, it's just that the effect is doubled by having both in the cast at once. Matt Damon is great to watch in a different role from his often brash characters. Cheadle is OK, but if anything is the weak link in the team (he is definitely not helped by his odd patois.) It is nice to see Roberts here, but did she really need to be in this? I don't think so. Her presence only clutters up an already complicated roster and is ultimately an unnecessary distraction to both lead characters and audience.Garcia shows just what a class act he is, and Reiner is nothing less than amazing in such exalted company. Director Soderbergh makes control of the film look like second nature, which probably means that every single shot was painstaking and laborious. Even though I personally was one of the few who failed to be charmed by 'Out of Sight', it was clear from watching THAT effort that the helmer was enormously talented. With films such as 'Erin Brockovitch' and now 'Ocean's 11', he adds yet more credence to that theory.At times the film almost becomes TOO cool. This at first seems like an absurd criticism to level at the film, but the brains behind the operation are so self assured and confident that they will succeed, there is never any doubt about the outcome. 'This is Hollywood', you cry, 'and therefore it is obvious they will win in the end'. That may be so, but most movies make concessions to dramatic tension, this one doesn't really bother.This is best illustrated by Clooney/Ocean's capitulation towards the end.The character gets caught for very specific reasons that are revealed before the film draws to a close, and it is made obvious that this needn't have happened unless it was planned by the crook, since the other 10 get away scott free. It is this cheeky jab in the face of authority that makes you feel like nothing could go wrong for the gang, except if they wanted it to; and it doesn't.This development also brings up the only other minor flaw that I can think of. I am prepared to accept the notion that Ocean (oops, poet and don't know it!) is willing to endure prison in order to win back his 'lost love', and I can even understand why Tess leaves Benedict after seeing him prepared to ditch her for his money. Why, however, does Tess not being with Benedict suddenly in one swoop resolve all her differences with Ocean? Why? Because this is Hollywood, that's why; and it's a plot element that needed a little more attention in order to be convincing, but because it is so near the end, this problem gets neglected in the rush to conclude.I've only mentioned two major flaws, and it's a stretch to even ATTEMPT to come up with any more, because by and large the job done is so professional. The cast and crew obviously put a lot of effort, craft and fun into making this, so you should reward them for their efforts by checking it out. See it.",9,0,1,22 February 2002
The Commitments," 'It's my pleasure to introduce to you the hardest working band in the world: Yes, yes, yes, THE COMMITMENTS!'
","That's quite a billing, but by the end of the film I can almost guarantee that you'll feel the group have lived up to it. If only they'd managed to hold it together - but then it wouldn't have been poetry...I can't be anymore blunt and truthful than to say that I adore this film. Right from its visually plain credits, the restless Irish soul music performed entirely by the youthful cast should get your feet tapping. Then Alan Parker takes us to an urban landscape that might be gray, but by God it's bustling. We can relate to Jimmy Rabitte immediately: the youthful entrepreneur who has innate confidence in his own salesmanship, and in his pre-fame existence grants imaginary interviews from the comfort of his bathtub. He's approached to provide guidance for some friends who are struggling to make their mark as musicians. Soon they have a direction and are banding together by applying for more members. A call is sent out far and wide that the Irish brothers are in need of some soul...Almost every member of the group is memorable and has their own particular idiosyncrasies. There's a palpable sense of adventure as they start out and their potential rapidly expands, because when they're on stage together they click. All of this success is undercut in a typically understated and deadpan example of Irish wit from Jimmy Rabitte Sr. He himself fancies the perks of stardom but isn't brave enough to pursue them, so instead is limited to crooning into a sauce bottle at home. In a very funny film its one of several memorable roles, but this time with a recognisable face playing it: Colm Meaney of 'Star Trek' and 'Con Air' fame. He isn't the only 'hidden talent' in the family either - look out for Andrea Corr as Jimmy Jr's younger sister! Natural performances and earthy humour combined with raw talent make this a winner from start to finish. Please don't miss this, otherwise you'll kick yourself. I'm very tempted to give a good shake to anybody who hasn't seen it yet, myself. It's an absolutely fantastic film!",10,8,13,7 August 2007
The Dirty Dozen," Fearless action from some of the 60's toughest character-actors.
","What better way to fight a war than with people crazy enough not to care much whether they live or die? This was one of the first tough guy(s) against the odds setup, but it worked well enough to spawn a host of descendants that carried on the formula. It's reasonable to assume, for example, that without the success of this back in the day there would have been no 'A-Team' for me to enjoy as I was growing up.Not even in the latter example however did they manage to enlist such a high quotient of acting talent. It's more fun to go along with the brawn and brute force when you have dab hands of their trade dishing it out for you. Lee Marvin and Telly Savalas are a couple of standouts, but my personal favourite is the unpredictable screen presence of Jim Brown.In the early part of the film it's fun to see these bunch of reprobates clash with unyielding authority. Once we get to the heart of the mission however this playful tone disappears almost completely to be replaced by a nihilistic attitude, allowing us to see just why these 12 individuals got their filthy reputation. It'll be a tough switch for some, no doubt, but at least there are no punches pulled. If you're looking for mercenary, uncompromising battle, then this is the daddy that without doubt taught the likes of Rambo and Co. a few tricks!",6,1,4,2 May 2007
No Country for Old Men," You can't outrun life.
","... Or alternatively, as the tagline puts it: 'No one gets away clean'. At the outset, each character is confident that they can outwit their adversaries and that their idealistic vision will ultimately prevail. What time comes to show them, however, is that life always holds all the aces, and that not one of them will emerge from their struggle with an ending that suits them in the long term. Even Chigurh, the one whom all his fellow humans fear throughout the runtime - seeming to carry as he does an aura of supernatural invulnerability - gets an implacable air of natural justice served upon him by receiving the scars of hard-fought struggle. It's an extremely fatalistic message delivered to us, emphasised by the barren and unforgiving landscape that is the arena for these happenings. Sooner or later, every mortal will find themselves accountable to a force beyond their comprehension.Javier Bardem becomes an utterly terrifying figure, despite never appearing to exert himself much, on screen. That's good acting, I guess, when you can distill your performance and still find it encompasses everything that is necessary. The other cast members are worthy of praise too, and the Coen brothers marshal each individual element at their disposal to deliver a full tale that seems note-perfect and quietly resonant. 'No Country for Old Men' is a film that leaves its imprint felt for a long time after viewing, and will deservedly be hailed as one of the true masterpieces of 2007.",10,5,10,10 February 2008
The Love Guru," If anyone needs help, it's Myers...
","This is offensively lazy material for any comedian worth his salt to be sitting on for six years (the last time he introduced characters he'd written himself: Goldmember.) Continuously repeating jokes about people's names is not funny, and it's being incredibly gracious to allow that it EVER was. What saddens me most is the reek of missed opportunity  lampooning new-age spirituality has seemingly endless comic potential, and yet nothing but the absolute bare bones are mined here. There's little attempt to work the gags into any sort of structure; they're just tossed away, and most of them can be heard to drop with a resounding thud.The same ramshackle approach applies to the main character, too; there appears to be little consistency or definable personality about Pitka, the one constant being that he dresses weird and has a beard (That rhyme is so lame I confess a slight sense of surprise that Myers didn't add that into the mix, too )On this evidence, maybe Myers is doing the right thing by hawking himself out for other people's scripts with his forthcoming efforts. It appears any ingenuity or inspiration he once possessed was sapped away long ago",1,9,18,9 March 2009
Tigerland," 'The only people fit for power are those who do not want it'...
","Wise words.  Not mine, of course, but nevertheless a maxim that seems especially relevant in these times of fighting first and seeking answers to the important questions later.I like that Colin Farrell as 'Bozz' is not necessarily an anti-hero in the 'Catcher-in-the-Rye' style sense; or a character who's too strong for his own movie (it belongs to a few other notables just as much as he).  We don't need someone to root for or hate, because escaping the situation and the decisions that led us there represents an 'end' in itself.No, 'Tigerland' isn't the first movie to draw our attention to the futility of combat; I'm sure it won't be the last - it doesn't even earn a distinction for its high quality alone.  These reasons, though certainly pleasant, are not why it scores its praise from me.  It's about 'moral' characters stranded where they don't belong.  It's rightly sensitive enough, though, to be aware that in the 'real' world it's happening concurrently with our daily lives, and crucially WITHOUT the 'safeguards' that fiction provides...Forget the intense camerawork, (the great film 'Salvador' did it first... ) and even try and brush aside the fact that this is Schumacher in thoughtful - but non-sappy or sensational - mode for once.  See it for its themes, instead - and perhaps leave it a more 'conscious' person than you were before.(9/10, or *****/***** in profile ratings system.)",9,1,1,1 September 2004
Batman Begins," The start of something spectacular... !
","... It's time for all those irate comic-book fans to finally purge their memories completely of the gaudy 'Batman Forever' and the frankly awful 'Batman & Robin' and kneel at the altar of one Christopher Nolan... He has given you back your franchise in a stunningly bedecked velvet box and given everyone a Dark Knight outing that's more than worthy of the name. It's suggested we take a leaf from the book of the 'Halloween' series and simply ignore those incarnations that we judged were not up to snuff; for this, as the title suggests, is where the Batman series TRULY Begins - and boy, what an inception we're treated to... ! You can all see those 10 gold stars at the top of the review, right? To give you a clearer idea of how much I hold this wonderful film in high regard; I rated Tim Burton's very respectable first effort a '7'... All of the 'untapped potential' the source material provides is utilised to stunning effect in 2005...'Fear' is the key, here, and it's nice to see all of the villains of the piece doing their bit to keep Mr. Wayne's torment fresh, without going over the top and seeming to inhabit another galaxy altogether, as previous antagonists had tended to do. Particularly pleasing for me was yet another authoritative turn by Mr. Liam Neeson, lending his considerable 'gravitas' to the benefit of one more veritable institution... All of the impressive cast pull their collective weight, though - obviously drawn in by a hot young director and his daring back-to-basics vision, rather than simply a massive paycheck...Ample time is spent allowing us to understand Bruce Wayne, too, and not just his alter-ego... Bale's acting is perfectly adept at conveying inner turmoil and outward charm, at the same time. Some moments of grim humour are allowed to poke through, every now and then; but never in the gleefully campy spirit of yore that would have ruined the atmospherically foreboding set-up. Indeed, like Spiderman, Batman's escapades invoke a lot of responsibility; and never slow to remind him of this, is Alfred! Scenes of concern for emotional wellbeing allow Bale and Caine to partner very effectively, and pack just as much 'wallop' - albeit of a different kind - as the jaw-dropping set-pieces. Most impressive above all, character definitely comes first, here; and with such a talented array of players and a range of issues to explore, how can you lose, really? ... all of which makes it paramount that as many of the same crew as practical are kept on board for possible continuation... ! From being just your averagely excited moviegoer beforehand, I've now been converted into a raving fanatic! This may be a great beginning for Batman, but it's decidedly mouthwatering to think of the places he can go, next...",10,0,1,17 June 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," Starts out with a good idea... but then wrecks it, in favour of the traditional 'quest for redemption' journey...
","I was enjoying the almost Bergman-esque angle of a bunch of video game characters and their search for self-worth, and a strong identity... but alas, then it tossed away those themes to focus on a more straightforward path that was largely preoccupied with achieving goals...Don't introduce interesting subplots, if you aren't then willing to follow those threads, all because you have to get back to your far less interesting (to me, anyway... ) conventional 'main plot'... Don't get my hopes up if you're just going to whet my appetite, but then leave me with very little that is satisfying. Plenty of films have a disposable plot, or narrative where the vast majority of it is just a selection of major characters goofing around ('Clerks' might be considered one, 'Be Kind Rewind' might be thought of as another... ) Sure, the execution may vary, and not all of them may work ('Be Kind Rewind' doesn't, really... ) but you'll never know unless you try to build a story around that setup. The issue here for me is that the most interesting line of thought in the movie was given the least exploration and screen time. I would far rather watch an interesting 20 minute short based around popular video game characters, than an anticlimactic full-length movie about original characters who are much less captivating (again, to me... ) I would have been happy to go along with the original storyline, if only I had not been shown something better, which was then abandoned to follow a formula that is common to 95% of movies that are already out there.",6,1,3,6 January 2014
Man on the Moon," Wearing down your resistance.
","Having viewed this movie for the second time today I now find it absurdly funny that when I watched it for the first time at least four years ago, I didn't get it. My first attempt at having a look stalled about 20 minutes in because I didn't know enough about the subject and sat down assuming that Kauffman was just another comedian. To me it was Jim Carrey doing a very convincing impersonation of some stranger with a funny haircut and a silly voice. I was befuddled. It seemed almost as if the film were daring me to switch off, being deliberately unconventional at the beginning to weed out those who would only miss the point. I caved in to its creeping demand, not being prepared to think at that time.Later I learnt that it wasn't just me. Andy Kauffman himself alienated a lot of people during his lifetime with the routines he performed, and so I resolved to watch it at least a second time now that I was armed with some idea of what to expect. On my second try I saw the whole thing, and what's more, I appreciated its aim, too.The most revelatory thing about Andy's approach is that it taught people something important if they were willing to observe. It taught them just how far imagination can take a person. If you have an imagination you can set your own rules, because then you'll be living up to your own standards and nobody else's. If you don't have an audience, pretend, like it's hinted Andy did as a kid - and then at any rate you won't be crestfallen if the real thing shows up only to leave. Executives may find it infuriating that you first and foremost choose to amuse yourself, but being so fearless will surely pull in a few admirers along the way, as a bonus.'What if they don't get it?!' 'Then I'll just keep trying until they do.' I know now that I'm living proof of this philosophy working. It took giving it a go twice, but I got there in the end! Carrey's performance is good enough to make the effort on everyones part worthwhile, no matter how long before things start to click. It'll happen sooner or later. Your resistance will wear down. Andy would've been proud, because if there's a compromise, it'll be in you and not the film.",8,1,2,18 January 2007
JFK," Invigorating retelling of a defining moment in history.
","'JFK' was one of those films in my uncle's collection that he said I should watch, and initially, I wasn't very keen. After all, the film weighs in at about 3hrs and concerns a man I had never had much interest in. The impressive cast list almost swayed me numerous times, but I still deferred...Then we were required to watch the opening segment as part of filmic analysis in a Media Studies class. Often, this provided an excuse to turn the brain off for a few minutes and look at the pretty pictures. I was unable to do that with 'JFK'. It got me uncomfortably but fascinatingly close to the action, something that Oliver Stone seems to have a knack for doing, judging by his previous movies that I've seen. I then borrowed the movie off my uncle, and now own a copy. The film makes the things you may have seen or heard previously about the assassination a thousand times more interesting. If you're in the fortunate position of ALREADY finding this stuff interesting, so much the better.When I read the reviews posted on this site for various films, I do not immediately take them for the gospel truth. I like to judge things for myself. At the same time, I'm interested in other people's opinions, whether they align with or contradict my own. Surely the intelligent will realise that this is merely Oliver Stone's OPINION about what happened on that fateful day. He may be right, he may not, but the fact that some of it may be pure conjecture doesn't make it any less entertaining a film to watch.Standouts in the cast are Lee Jones and Oldman. Lee Jones in particular delivers a performance that is at once delightfully camp, yet also eerily sinister. Oldman is as good as ever. The man cannot deliver a bad performance, even in horrid films (Romeo is Bleeding)The music score is terrific at helping to convey the sense of being on the verge of a momentous breakthrough. It's also gratifying to see that Stone devotes a fair amount of time to documenting how the case affects Garrison's relationship with his family, rather than simply sticking to the bare bones of the investigation. True, it would have been a shorter film, but also much less interesting.Stone is at his best when he has definite targets to aim for through his work. Where 'Platoon' failed for me was that it conveyed the message that war is hell, but did so in a vague, lazy way. 'Salvador', by contrast, took you right into the heart of the conflict and never let you forget the futility of it all. 'JFK', I'm pleased to say, is closer in spirit to the latter because it stirs the emotions through the passion of the director. It made me care about an event I previously regarded as unimportant, because now I see the value of fighting for the truth to be revealed, whether it be Stone's version or otherwise.",10,3,15,1 April 2001
Good Will Hunting," The boys done good... (May Contain Spoilers)
","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve every word of praise they got for this movie, IMO. Instead of complaining that there weren't enough meaty roles around for them they got to work writing their own, and beautifully written it is too. There is some debate about whether veteran screenwriter William Goldman had a hand in the finished product, but nobody slags off Tobe Hooper because Steven Spielberg supposedly directed the lion's share of 'Poltergeist', do they? Anyway, I reckon if Goldman WAS involved, it was only to polish up a few minor details. The bulk of the screenplay has the air of being written partly from experience. I think the criticism the lads received may just have been jealousy from the Hollywood establishment at having the temerity to nab their first Oscars so young. In all areas, not just the script, 'GWH' stands out as being a quality product.The guys deserve great credit for tackling a serious issue with their first screenplay and not merely filling the script with a lot of scatological humour (Though there is some of that here too, it just doesn't seem out of place) All of the characters are well rounded and sympathetic in some way, and you never feel they are there simply out of formula or to further the plot. The development of the story grows organically through the characters. Even Skylar, the love interest (played beautifully by Minnie Driver, as too are the rest of the performances great) is an interesting character in her own right and someone we want to follow through the story. The only measurable difference between her role and that of Matt Damon's is that he has more screen time, but this is understandable, given that he is the title character.In reply to those who say that the repeated profanity use highlights a lack of writing skills, I disagree. Often I DO think that repeated swearing is unnecessary to a story and unimaginative; not that it offends me, it doesn't. I do think that film-makers look at the success of a guy like Quentin Tarantino, who writes great dialogue and also uses a lot of profanity, and think that the former is because of the latter. It isn't. Here, the profanity seems natural. Look at the monologues given to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) I think they are superbly written, and they contain very little profanity. Same goes for Stellan Skarsgard's dialogue.There are 3 scenes that stand out as being superbly written for me (not necessarily in chronological order)* Will's monologue about why he doesn't want to work for NASA* The scene with Skylar when he tells her of his abuse* Sean Maguire pouring scorn on Will's supposed 'life experience'(paraphrase) 'Someone that could level you with their eyes,Wakin up every mornin' feelin' like God put anangel on earth just for you...'On a sombre note, I can relate to the above quote because it mirrors what I feel about a 'special someone', who I unfortunately can't be with. Still, personal identification aside, these are all wonderfully written.Gus Van Sant also does an under-appreciated job with the direction. It seems like he realised that he had a good script on his hands and he didn't want to ruin it with any needless showboating. Even though there are no visual acrobatics, I would bet that almost every scene came off better than Matt and Ben envisioned when they were writing it.Deserves to be seen at least once by everyone. Those in the mood for a personal project with big name stars that resonates in all the right places, this one's for you.",10,7,16,23 March 2001
Dog Day Afternoon," This film shows why Al Pacino is rightly regarded as one of the finest actors ever.
","Say what you like about the direction of Lumet, which is great, or the performances of the other supporting characters, which are also good; this is Pacino's film.  His portrayal of a jittery bank robber who becomes overwhelmed by the pressure his stunt generates is simply magnificent. There are not enough superlatives in the English language to describe it, but here's one more: Masterful.   His performance reels you into the film and never lets you go for the entire running time.  It has to be said that some of the credit for this must go to the great script he was given, but it was truly a tour de force from the great man.  He is entertaining whether in scenery chewing mode ('Devils Advocate', occasionally here when the script calls for it) or oozing brooding intensity ('Donnie Brasco', 'The Godfather's')  Eminently watchable.   I hate to turn this review into a gushing Pacino love-fest, but honestly, the film wouldn't be the true classic it's known as without him.  Great film maybe, Classic?  No, Pacino elevates it to that level.   An object lesson as to how one man's performance can energise an entire film.  Don't believe me?  Think of the film without Pacino at its hub and tell me that that particular finished product wouldn't be much the poorer film.  Go on, I dare you...!",10,3,4,2 March 2001
The Game," Like opening a lavishly wrapped present and discovering that the wrapping is all there is... (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)
","I was really looking forward to this film given that it was Fincher's follow-up to the superb 'Se7en' and that the cast contained Sean Penn. For me, Fincher is the most exciting director working in Hollywood today and has rarely put a foot wrong either in his technique or his script choices. Sean Penn is a maverick whose colourful life off screen adds barely needed interest value to some eclectic films and performances.A message to these two crew members: 'Sean, I can't really blame you for the debacle that is the end result of this film, I just wish you'd expunge it from your CV. David, what were you doing? Unless it was the studio's decision to foist off that pathetic ending on the audience, you made a serious error of judgement; so far the only one in your otherwise brilliant career, but an error nonetheless. Here's hoping that 'The Panic Room' will once more fully showcase the brilliance I've come to expect from yourself...' Usually, a film has to have several bad points before I will stoop to awarding a '1' rating on IMDb, but this is one film where the ending is so inconceivably awful as to negate everything good that has gone before. Fincher does a neat line in edgy suspense and for most of the film this is showcased brilliantly. However, as I remember, this is quite a long film and towards the end my patience was stretched by the seeming lack of an impending payoff. I started to idly wonder about the possible climax, with each new thought being more innovative and thrilling than the last. Then the movie delivers, and it's such a letdown. I was expecting Fincher to keep with the 'dark' themes he has exploited so well in all his other movies, but instead of a visceral sucker punch we get the movie being far too literal. As such, any second viewing would most likely be pointless, since then you'll know that all the posturing of the slow-burn build up leads to something completely empty. Not that I was planning to sit through a well-done first half again to get to its shallow conclusion. Once was enough. The single biggest cinematic disappointment of my life. Not even 'Showgirls' received a lower rating than this from me. Now that's scary... !",1,58,106,21 February 2001
Ghostbusters," They're here to save the world...
","A comedy with such a kooky premise already has pretty high odds of turning out well. Even someone as workaday as Stephen Sommers might toil to totally screw this up, but when entrusted to individuals with the pedigree of Reitman, Ramis, Ackroyd and Murray, you're more or less certain this is going to be special, and you'd be right.Just the idea of (initially) three experimental parapsychologists bearing the responsibility of protecting ordinary citizens from ghastly spirits is funny. In the words of Dr. Peter Venkman: 'Back off man, we're scientists!' ... Wouldn't really fill you with much faith, would it? Until, that is, you see them in action...Everything in this movie fits together perfectly. The chemistry between the team is unrepeatable, the script is both smart and funny and the special effects hold up well even in this computerised age. All fun-loving people between the ages of 7 and 80 should be required to watch this. It's a model for how to execute a big-budget comedy, and since it's release, disappointingly there's only been a few clever souls in the industry who've actually sat down and taken notice.",9,0,0,12 June 2007
Men in Black II," Same old routine, the trailer says - but with one crucial difference...
","... it just wasn't funny this time! It replicates the quality of both the effects and the procedural hallmarks that we know, and does it well enough I suppose, but there were virtually NO laughs. The witty writing of the first has been totally usurped, and there's a sea of lowest common denominator, kiddie-orientated blandness in its place.It shows that they were struggling for energetic material when the main difference in the sequel is the reversal of status, here making Jones the novice to Smith's old hand. Now, call me over-expectant if you'd like, but I was anticipating a little more innovation; sadly the audience are handed precious little they can get worked up over. Almost every detail contributes to a flat and uninspired slog. It's heavily dispiriting when you recall that the original had such freshness and vigour about it. The producers were that desperate for some liveliness that they were anxious to put a Will Smith ad-lib into the trailer. If the script had been up to snuff in the first place, then maybe he wouldn't have found it so necessary to think on his feet for the sake of a laugh. Asking the stars to bail the entire movie out by using only their own talents is a risky strategy that shouldn't have been necessary. It ends up being too big of a requirement to carry through successfully, despite the gifted personalities that were present on-set.If the idea of a pug singing 'I will survive' makes you wanna wet yourself, have a ball by all means...

Million Dollar Baby," More like a thousand dollars, I'd say...

This should not blind people to one or two glaring flaws that slipped under the radar; all thanks to the public willingness to happily accept a 'pat' story that rings all of the old bells.There were indeed a boatload of clichés that could almost be found in any number of daytime soap-operas; however, I did like the focus on Clint's character and his shaky confidence - since he's one of the only ones out there still doing 'hard-luck' stories about craggy old men, instead of plucky young dynamos! Put it this way; I can think of many more deserving recipients of Best Picture in the past that somehow missed out.

","Much as I like the classic examples of that particular film, when I first started to watch this I thought I might be getting a little tired of 'Mob expose' pictures. I was wrong.Here you have two of the greatest actors in modern American cinema finally sharing a screen together. Boy do we get chemistry. Add to that the presence of an able supporting cast and a great script and you got the recipe for one heck of a film, and it doesn't disappoint.It's very impressive that Mike Newell had previously directed 'Four Weddings...' and then made this. Both are accomplished films but this definitely beats the earlier effort. The films are obviously very different but both are quality pictures and that's the mark of a good director. If you hated FW&AF then perhaps this little film will convince you that Newell can direct...(SPOILERS)Pacino has done this schtick countless times before and it seemingly never gets old, he's superb as usual. Depp matches him every step of the way and even overshadows him at some points, showing laudable restraint in difficult sequences that show him trying and failing to balance his home life with the requirements of his job. One outstanding scene has him forced into violence to keep up the charade of being a mobster. The expressions we see on his face perfectly capture the inner person who is disgusted at his actions and also the outward appearance of a man indulging his violent streak. Superb.The pacing is perfect, the movie never feels rushed and plays out as you expect it would. This is not to say that the move is particularly predictable. I look at this more as a character study than a plot driven affair, and it is refreshing in a gangster movie not to be a mite confused about who's doing what to whom, a la 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels'.I wonder about the film stock that Newell used. The movie has a peculiarly grimy but not dark feel that aids the idea of Pistone going undercover perfectly. We are also treated to several interesting shots, as if the camera is a 'spy' itself, taking us right into the heart of Mob dealings. Depp and Pacino were made to be on the same screen. More of them together please! The movie they and the director deliver is probably my favourite gangster flick, and it's up against some pretty stiff competition with the likes of 'The Godfather Trilogy' and 'Casino'. Simply put: Brilliant film making.",9,0,0,9 March 2001
Dumb and Dumber," I liked it, others may not...
","... because the gags are so quickfire and chucked into the script with little thought as to whether they suit the plot (what plot?) or whether the characters would realistically say them.  No matter for me, because I was laughing all the way through, but I can appreciate why some people might not like that.   Like I said, don't go into this looking for a plot, because there isn't really anything other than the most basic premise to satisfy the distributors.  I personally found it refreshing that the movie asked no requirement of me other than that I be able to laugh.  This I did, loudly and frequently.   A final note on who I consider to be the main star of the show.  It ain't Carrey.  Jim, of course, does what we expect him to do.  However, it is Daniels - in an achingly funny turn - who surprises, and in doing so effortlessly steals the movie from under the nose of the rubberfaced loon standing beside him.  It may have something to do with the fact that Harry is (marginally) the more subtle of the two characters.",8,46,76,28 November 2001
The Evil Dead," At the time, it mixed old and new shock tactics to stunning effect!
","If you're a young, talented and ambitious film-maker; how to get people's attention? Well, horror's always a reliable genre in which to make your first big 'splash'; being as it doesn't have to be entirely dependant on 'flashy' effects, if you're on a tight budget. Some 'innovative' camera-work always goes down nicely, too. (how many subsequent films have copied John Carpenter's ingenious 'edge-of-frame' technique in 'Halloween', for example?) Oh yeah, getting your film banned at least helps in the 'notoriety' stakes, too; so often as it is the clinching factor in persuading otherwise indifferent audience members to have a look and see what all the fuss was about.... all requirements eagerly met by the joyful enterprise known as 'The Evil Dead'! There's plenty of the traditional spooky music and dark foreboding spaces, but brought to the table for the first time in 1981 were audacious camera moves and a no-holds-barred approach to piling on the gore! I'm sure it felt fresh in its early days of release, and surprisingly, it still feels fresh today. This is 'Grand Guignol' horror that has no time to linger in admiration over its gruesome handiwork, due to its breakneck pace. I'm now prepared to forgive Raimi the first film of his that I saw, ('Darkman') thanks to the fun I had watching this. Little details make me eagerly await the chance to catch the other two entries, also - the first minor cameo from the 'chainsaw', for example! It's a simple plot - basically just watching Bruce Campbell slay the ranks of the undead - and even the OTT nature of what's gone before is stretched by the 'Claymation'-like explosions of the finale; but such largely irrelevant quibbles are almost wholly redeemed by the unforgettable nature of the last shot. It's best to experience that for yourself; but bear in mind when you watch that you're seeing elements that have since become mainstays of every notable scarefest within the last 20 years. Was LOTR director and future Oscar winner Peter Jackson taking notes prior to making 'Bad Taste', for instance? You bet!",9,1,2,12 March 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," In its duplicity lies the film's beauty... (RISK OF SPOILERS. SNIPPETS OF DIALOGUE CONTAIN CONCEALED OBSCENITIES)
","The change of pace halfway through helps the film, because although the audience should have been having a perfectly good time up until then, it keeps us glued firmly to our seats lest we miss any more surprises.  The film would surely have flagged had it continued in its linear direction, but the change in tone ensures that's never allowed to happen.  The film begins at almost breakneck pace and never slows down.  The tone of the horror is B-movie stuff, but that's okay, since the characters evidently KNOW they've encountered some surreal events.  Whatever else you can call dialogue from Quentin Tarantino, it's never boring, and the characters are all sufficiently interesting to keep us wondering just how they'll cope with their descent into the maelstrom.  This is supported by the excellent casting.  Whatever the titles may say, Clooney is the real star of the show, as evidenced by my favourite lines section at the end of this review.  The man has charisma to burn, and he displays plenty of it here.   The film is such a compendium of unexpected moments that years from now some instances will be regarded as 'classic'.  Heck, the whole film deserves to be regarded as such for it's daring approach to such an established legend.  You are almost sure to form bonds with the characters, quote the dialogue and reminisce with friends about favourite moments.  It's that kind of film.  Relax, have a few favourite snacks/refreshing beverages handy. Preferably have company while you watch; and have a ball.  It's DEFINITELY not high art, and there are times when it threatens to derail itself completely, but it's glorious fun.MY BEST LINES: -    'Don't you ever try and f***ing run on us, 'cos I got six little friends, and they can all run faster than you can.' -   'Is my s**t together, or is my s**t together?'   MAN: 'What's your name, girlie?' GIRL: 'Kate' MAN:  'Sex Machine, Kate; pleased t'meetcha' -    'I just rammed a wooden stake into my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, and I don't believe in vampires.  Apart from that I'm peachy Kate, the world is my oyster.' -    'You touch my brother with that stake, biker, and vampires aren't gonna have to suck your blood, they're gonna be able to lick it up off the floor' -    SETH:  'I don't care about livin' or dyin' anymore, I just wanna send as many of these devils back to hell as I can' JACOB: 'Amen' -   'I may be a b****rd, Kate, but at least I'm not a f***in b****rd'  and my absolute favourite:  'Psycho's do not explode when sunlight hits them, I don't give a f**k how crazy they are!' - Dave -",8,1,2,23 May 2001
Jerry Maguire," An immensely likable movie. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","The reason this film succeeds despite initially appearing to have a poor premise is its fantastic writing. The characters at once seem like real people we can identify with, but not so mundanely 'real' that they forget to say something funny now and again. The dialogue is by and large NOT full of banal observations about the economic state of the sports industry, because Crowe wisely realises that the crowd who go to see romantic comedies will most likely not care about that aspect. What they WILL care about is mostly sympathetic characters, a believable central romance and an ounce of chemistry between the two leads. Crowe and his performers ensure that they get all that, and at times unexpectedly more too...The film does occasionally lapse into sentimentality with the whole 'play with your heart, not for the paycheck' thing, but this is offset nicely by the charm of the leading players and Maguire's acknowledgement at the beginning that his 'rebirth' will sound 'somewhat 'touchy-feely'...' The supporting characters are all so skillfully drawn too, that even if the central relationship doesn't quite work for you, you're sure to find something of interest in the more minor characters. A particular standout here is Jay Mohr as the slimy agent 'Bob Sugar'. He shows real talent here and it's a great surprise (possibly down to poor script choices) to see that he's still woefully underused by Hollywood.Whilst Cuba Gooding Jr is fine here, I still cannot believe he won an Oscar for his performance, as he doesn't come anywhere near matching the other talent on show. I'm not saying that Cruise should have won an Oscar, but I could have understood that a whole lot more...Great soundtrack too. You can tell as much care has gone into the composition of that as has the rest of the movie. A rare thing in today's market, that's filled with horrendous 'Music inspired by..' rip-offs.(At the time of writing... ) this is STILL the only Cameron Crowe film I've seen. Judging by the mostly glowing reviews heaped upon his other works, it seems safe to say that Jerry Maguire isn't merely a lucky one-off for this director. The film really is delightfully enjoyable to watch.",10,1,5,30 March 2001
Mission: Impossible II," If you saw the trailer, then you knew what you were gonna get..
","The trailer was filled with nicely choreographed action sequences, cool one liners and various beautiful people set to a rocking soundtrack. I have to ask, if that didn't look like it was gonna be your thing, then why see the movie? It patently looked nothing like the first film (which was also excellent) so people decrying it as 'just another action movie' have missed the point of the entire exercise, I feel.I don't usually like John Woo's style, too symbolism-heavy and stylised for my tastes, but it works surprisingly well here, probably because the main part of the film is spent probing the characters. There are some great set-pieces, beautiful cinematography and a first-rate cast. Cruise does a complete character transformation from the first film and emerges as a creditable action hero. Thandie Newton is great as always, both as eye-candy and because she's a talented actress, and Dougray Scott is largely brilliant as the villain Ambrose. Makes me think he would have made a great Wolverine in X-Men (although Hugh Jackman IS absolutely perfect for that role) Anthony Hopkins even appears for a perfect cameo, an even better Jim Phelps than Jon Voight was in the first movie!I think the fact that it's so markedly different from the first one makes it a more enjoyable experience to watch them together, since they're both different types of movie. I would agree that the plot here is perhaps a bit TOO simple after the mind scramble that was M:I, but at least it's interesting, regardless of whether it was filched from Hitchcock or not. If you're gonna pilfer from anybody, best that they be a recognised genius... !Ultimately, M:I-2 is a summer 'event' movie that delivers in spades. If you come across the trailer and LIKE it, then the movie's even better; if it leaves you cold, then don't watch the movie!",8,0,1,7 March 2001
Annie Hall," Its only agenda should have been comedy, leave all the other stuff at the door.
","Woody Allen is a master humourist, few would argue that.  His jokes and observations are so well constructed that it would take more skill to mangle them than it would to get the laughs and recognition they were created for. Ironically, for me, Woody Allen actually proves this HIMSELF a couple of times here.  Wisecracks that seemed faultless on the page are reduced to being merely very funny by Allen's patented nervous delivery.  Some might find that this character makes his humour all the more amusing, but to me, neuroses get old unless they themselves are the target of the funnies.The material is strong enough to ride these slightly irritating tics - what it wasn't strong enough to do was convince me fully that this was an authoritative take on modern social mores and manners.  This is only Allen's perspective, it isn't everybodys - and whilst there's nothing wrong with that if you're only looking to laugh heartily and repeatedly, it does handicap Annie Hall's ambitions to be 'more than just a comedy' somewhat. 
The structure contributes partly to this, often feeling as it does more like a string of improvised skits than a cohesive movie.  This is just one big Allen standup routine with a basic 'relationship' theme.  I see nothing wrong with that as a concept, but should it really have won Best Picture?I don't understand people who say this film has such a broad scope. Infrequent references to drugs and minor celebrity to illustrate the discomfiture Woody has with the whole issue of 'belonging' aren't enough to qualify it as 'wide-ranging'.  Things like this do the opposite in fact, they are insular details that remind us that this is 'Woody' we're watching and not some anti-hero that has the same problems we do.What fools people into thinking there's more going on here than 'just' romantic comedy?  Oscars certainly helped (The main ones never having been dished out to so 'vulgar' a genre either before or since) and the idea that this was a 'personal' film from Allen.  It's not, I felt as removed from his character - if not his wisdom - by the end as I did before I began watching. Do I care if I enjoyed the experience and was greatly amused?  Not a jot. Just don't try to sell it to me as some kind of 'profound meditation'.  It's no more that than any other good comedy.  Good comedy does that, though, it deceives us into thinking it's opening up new vistas when really it's the audience that does all the spadework by turning the mirror onto society.Allen's comedy is hilarious enough to be its OWN justification.  It doesn't need lumbering with any kind of 'social significance'.  We do that all too readily ourselves as an audience - as has been shown.",8,0,0,30 May 2003
Men in Black," No chemistry? To me they mark the most inspired cinematic double-act since Gibson 'n' Glover...
","(SPOILERS)      It's happened with all the great double-acts, both cinematic and otherwise, one is zany and madcap whilst the other acts as a foil for his more expressive partner.  So it is here.  Tommy Lee Jones underplays almost every line given to him here and allows Smith to act it up in his role. Both are marvellous.  Of course it helps that the script is achingly sharp, with scarcely a line wasted, but Jones interpretation of the part is so perfect that he invests even seemingly unimportant lines with just the right amounts of lightness and gravitas.  Witness as evidence his opening line: 'We'll take it from here...'.  It truly has to be seen to be appreciated just how gut-bustingly funny Jones makes these words seem with his deadpan delivery.  In my opinion, the finest comedy debut by a 'serious' actor since Jeff Daniels gave his hilarious turn in 'Dumb & Dumber.   We all know Smith can do comedy.  Even those of you who don't like his brand of humour can probably appreciate why some people find him funny.  Put simply, if you like his style, you'll like this, since he doesn't change much from the characters we found in ID4, 'The Fresh Prince...' et al.  Hey, I'm not complaining though, he's perfectly suited to the style of movie that MIB is.   There are very few easy laughs in MIB's script, which is probably why I think it's one of the funniest comedies in years.  You have to listen to the dialogue and delivery to extract maximum amusement from the situation. Classic example:  Smith is talking to K in the elevator before he becomes a recruit:  J: 'I don't wanna be known as 'kid', 'sport', 'son', 'junior'...' K: 'Sure, whatever you say Slick'. There could have been a temptation in a comedy such as this to let the effects get the laughs and to neglect the script.  Thankfully, this wasn't done.  The effects are there to augment the comedy, not provide it.  (Kudos to Rick Baker by the way, for his stunning creations.)  I have to conclude that the majority of people who didn't find this funny probably weren't paying enough attention! View again carefully and see if I'm right, if you still don't like it, then I've obviously just got a totally different sense of humour to you!  To sum up, I think this is a fantastic film in all departments that showed us just how funny the Smith/Jones partnership could be when given the opportunity to work together on such quality material.  I said in my summary the best screen pairing since Gibson 'n' Glover.  That double-act also conforms to the expectations given at the start of the review.  I would have mentioned Carrey 'n' Daniels instead, except I feel that Jim's performance was ever so slightly overdone in that movie.  Ah well. that's a whole 'nother subject!  Roll on MIB2!",10,1,2,14 February 2001

I don't know about rain - it's a breeze to watch!In the most pleasant surprise, I didn't even know that the song 'Good Morning' was also from this film, until I sat down to watch the whole thing... Ha, and I call myself a student of cinema! There's more to this wonderful concoction than just the rightly celebrated setpiece from which the movie takes its name.Truly a joyous, uplifting, life affirming experience... and yet, I still contend that I don't really like musicals!

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Frustrating, because the desperate desire to be 'quirky' threatens to forestall interesting exploration, just like 'BJM'... (SPOILERS!)
","There's some beautifully affecting and underplayed romance in 'Eternal Sunshine' that at times is so poignant and realistic in its approach it feels a wonderfully fresh antidote to the sanitized gloss that Hollywood usually turns out.  A romantic movie for those who dislike 'conventional' romantic movies, then?Well, no.  Oftentimes the simplest moments are the most touching ones, and everybody here is so concerned with convoluting the journey at times that the real moments of empathy sometimes wind up getting lost.  It's a shame that an idea so full of possibility just goes nuts with that very quality, adding more complex elements that aren't needed, primarily to appease a more 'highbrow' audience.  I found Kauffman's earlier film 'Being John Malkovitch' suffered from much the same problem as far as I was concerned; an ingenious central concept, the effect of which emerged diluted because of far too much unnecessary 'weirdness'.  A case of Kauffman and co. gilding the lily, if you will, which unfortunately is in evidence again here.'Eternal Sunshine' hit a bullseye when it just concentrated solely on exploring the pain of loss.  Despairingly, though, it almost turned into a bad quasi-thriller with the advent of stuff about Joel and Clementine preserving old memories by artificially recreating new ones, and other such wandering into artificial realities.  I understood the musing that after the erasure process complications may arise from people still being inexorably drawn to each other without remembering why; ponder this, though: Did such a large portion of the movie REALLY need to be hijacked by such extraneous detail taking up space?  The net result of such a course as far as I could see was the emotional 'heart' of the movie nearly being allowed to wither away.  This is a more lamented loss than in the case of 'Being John Malkovitch', purely because there's MORE of it in this instance!  The 'nuts and bolts' that once held Clementine and Joel's relationship together are pitifully neglected, on occasion.The positive moments for me, though, are the ones borne of 'tenderness'. The film manages the unique trick of being at once achingly personal at times, yet oddly universal, as well.  Memories are those which are private to us, but we have the facility to share them with others, too.  It's the completely charming cinematic couple of Clementine and Joel that made me root for love as an 'ideal' and always want to keep watching.  In particular, I'm now convinced that it would be a betrayal of Carrey's talents if he were to return to the arena of slapstick comedy without such strong central stories underpinning him.  Now, all he (and Kauffman ESPECIALLY!) need to do is find a balance and stay on the right side of 'idiosyncratic', because 'Sunshine' sees them veering away on unnecessary tangents far too often for my liking.  (7/10 or ***/***** by 'profile' rating standards)",7,0,1,28 July 2004
Invictus," Inglorious Victory...
","I would prefer it had they chosen another angle to look at Mandela's life.It was made extremely obvious in the movie that the game was a metaphor for pulling together and no longer acting in self-interest, so the 'bonding' before the games was interesting, but at the end of the day I just don't give a fig about rugby, so I didn't need to see so much onfield action. If you're going to put Mandela in a movie, then make it about him, and not how he encouraged another organisation to do his work of uniting a nation.Having said that, if you appreciate movies about how sport can bring people together and hasten social change away from the playing field, then this still does stand as a decent entry into that canon.",7,0,1,22 February 2010
Mission: Impossible," I don't fully understand it, but I love it!
","I've seen this movie maybe 2 or 3 times, and I STILL haven't quite got my head around the plot, but that takes nothing away from the simple fact that M:I is a great movie.Never having seen more than five minutes of the original TV series, I can't comment on whether Cruise was perfect for the role of Hunt, but he does fine here. This is his show, seeing as he produced it and he's the main character, and he's got the star power to keep you glued to the screen. Almost every other character is incidental.De Palma, as usual, entertains with his camera acrobatics and one or two flawlessly executed set pieces. As other users have commented, this is a perfect return to the old-style spy movie: plot-heavy and intelligent. The location shooting is interesting also.Cruise and De Palma have teamed up to great effect to produce one of the most enjoyable action adventures of the 90's. Enjoy!",9,1,2,8 March 2001

Not. my thing, at all... It's the ultimate stage-brat movie. I have a lot of sympathy for those types of people. I took drama classes... but they tend to become grating, after awhile - and this film grated on me, REALLY fast. Life is not light and frothy. Sometimes we have to do things we don't like. Don't ask me to coddle self-indulgence.I knew going in that I wasn't a fan of musicals, so you may ask why I freely chose to watch this... The answer is that - as with any genre - occasionally I find an example that surprises me (Top Hat, Chicago, Moulin Rouge... )Unfortunately, I found no such surprises, here. The best part of watching it was knowing that as soon as I finished it, I'd never have to see it, again.

Sinister," 'Sinister' is overselling it...
","Amityville with an unlikable crime writer. It basically amounts to Ethan Hawke wandering around a dark house for nearly two hours, pretending to be scared, like an unwitting Pied Piper.It has all the elements for a spooky story, but either overuses images that could be creepy in isolation too many times to be consistently effective, or else doesn't want to put any proper meat on the bones of its central idea. Like a cheap fairground ride, there are a few jump scares, but any substance of true terror vanishes the second you emerge into daylight.",5,1,3,5 September 2017
The Hurricane," Simplistic and biased, only Washington's performance saves this from the mire...
","This film has 'triumphalism' written all over it, from the official synopsis to the opening credits to, even yes, the end.  This is a movie that never begins to consider the idea that its audience may just disagree with some of its cavalier assumptions.  We simply are served the tale of an 'indomnitable fight for justice', failing spectacularly to convince on most levels, apart from Washington's performance as the main character.As he did in 'Cry Freedom', Denzel elevates the dross around him.  'The Hurricane' suffers from being appallingly threadbare in detail, as opposed to bloated and pompous like the Attenborough treatise years earlier.  Still, Washington almost works miracles again, inspiring dignity where by rights there should be none.The details of the framed crime are scant, perhaps because if it were fleshed out a little bit, the implausibly bitter pill would be that much harder to swallow.  Where is proper motive, expositional dialogue, nuance to scenes?  Nowhere to be found.  The world of 'The Hurricane' is black and white, uncomfortable given that the movie only airily tosses racism into the mix as an afterthought compared to its other indignations.  Maybe that's why any unjust motive for imprisoning Ruben that there may be is so muddled.  A proper dissection of race-relations would only serve to derail the film from the blatant righteous agenda that it insists on having.  The family of Carter supporters, like the jury who convicted him prior to their championing, are too easily convinced.  The audience outside the confines of this fictional world are the only ones who are probably likely to be found scratching their heads.Hannah is badly miscast.  Why pick somebody with a Scottish brogue if accent was going to be important?  It's not even easy to see why he's there in the first place.  Only Washington and the boy contribute anything worthwhile to the story.  Given the liberties with the material the makers already chose to sanction, why didn't they just compress at least one more character and remove that difficulty altogether?The actual fight scenes are surprisingly well done.  A shame then, that they do nothing to contribute to the 'noble' image the film would like so much to establish for its lead character.  Like the performance of Washington which is ultimately in vain, they are but one more insufficient coat of gloss on a tale that all too visibly begins to 'peel' with alarming rapidity.",4,4,8,6 May 2003
The Fly," Successful transition of Cronenberg's brand of 'body horror' to the mainstream...
","Why is it this film that will always be his REAL 'breakout', and not any of the others before or since? The truth is, beneath all the biological yucks and makeup (there is plenty of both) lies a strong emotional core. Goldblum is enthusiastically likable as scientist Seth Brundle, and Geena Davis is just how Geena Davis seems to be in real life... sweet. It is how the events change both characters EMOTIONALLY, not physically, that inspires the true horror.The blending of both the above elements makes this remake appeal simultaneously to the 'gross out' crowd, and those in the mood for a more cerebral horror experience. A concept of B-movie stature, electrified by the skills of A-list talent.",7,50,66,10 April 2002
From Hell," A Classy Chiller...
","What makes 'From Hell' a classy chiller that's 'a cut above' the rest? Well, a decent script and a handful of fine performances certainly helps. What is actually crucial about the script is not that it is particularly Oscar worthy, but that it never jars the viewer from the timezone that the film is supposed to be set in.  Several other details about Victorian London are very convincing as well.  So, that takes care of the setting, what about the actual mechanics of the story?   It definitely held the interest, but I can't help feeling that the whole experience would have been slightly more satisfying had the makers dealt separately with the two stories of the 'inspired copper' and the 'tart with a heart'.  Leaving aside such pedantic quibbles as these not actually being faithful renderings of real people, the feeble attempt at creating a romance between the two leads does not work.  That said, both are interesting enough to keep the film running smoothly when we encounter them each on their own.   It's definitely 'artistic license' to cast an actress as beautiful as Heather Graham as a 19th century English prostitute, but she does OK, without once threatening to steal the thunder of her more established co-stars.  Depp is as convincing as usual, proving a reliably intense performer on which to hang the bones of the story.  Give the man a part in 'Eastenders'!  Robbie Coltrane is good as usual, playing advisor to Abberline; and Ian Holm can always be relied upon to give good value.  So each member of the cast (whether American or not) seems quite at home in the 'grimy' capital depicted.  Much credit though, must also go to directors The Hughes brothers for making this a thoroughly interesting watch.  They handle their first foray into horror territory well, suggesting a return may not be out of the question.   If you have an idea of what to expect when you sit down to watch, I struggle to see how you could be disappointed.  There are minor flaws to be sure, but not enough to really ruin the 'mood'; and it is the skillfully created atmosphere - contributed to by all - which goes a long way towards making 'From Hell' one of the best unsettling thrillers to come out in quite a while...",8,0,1,8 March 2002
Groundhog Day," The rare kind of comedy that has repeated replay value.
","... We know the day so well that we feel like we're living it with Phil after only a few viewings, and we enjoy certain moments, but crucially we have the option to turn it off whenever we want!There's a vicarious joy to be had from seeing someone who has the chance to road-test his different responses to events that he knows are going to occur. How many times have you wished you could say something to someone, only for the moment to be forever lost because the perfect comment didn't strike you at the time? The character of Phil Connors gets the opportunity to punch irritating old acquaintance Ned Ryerson, but it's OK because he doesn't seem to take that anger with him into the next cycle - he's tried that solution and he knows it isn't an answer for the future, but it makes him feel better, anyway! How would you deal with the problems you encounter in a typical day? The genius of this screenplay is it seems to have all the variable options for the different situations covered, and it's hilariously funny along the way.The movie may have a simple philosophical base, but the whole thing is cheerfully thorough in its exploration. The repetition might seem a little frustrating at first, but when everything is over you'll realise that it can really be a wonderful life - even if Murray's patented sourpuss expression for most of the film seems like it's telling you otherwise! *'I was in the Virgin Islands once.

National Treasure," Rusty Sheriff's Badge.
","Where was the character development you got with Indiana Jones; the movies which basically serve as a template for this effort?? This had none of the charm - or let's face it, outright coolness of Indy - it was basically a by-the-numbers, pieces-of-the-puzzle lurch from one set-piece to another. All the requisite hero-helpers get barely a decent line between them; there's nowhere near enough 'polish' on the script...Also, I don't go to an adventure movie to be thrown some half-baked facsimile of history that can be distorted spectacularly according to the needs of an outlandish but mechanical plot. If actual events aren't interesting enough, then don't invent your own substandard reality. As big a spectacle as this was surely designed to be needs a heck of a lot more kinetic thrills, rather than just expect us to be satisfied by staring at dusty old logbooks full of inane contrivances. The sum total of what transpires left me feeling a little unsatisfied. Ho-hum; roll on Indy 4, begone National Treasure 2...",5,1,2,7 June 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Takes numerous influences and moulds them into something superb...
","With 'Reservoir Dogs', Tarantino created a heist film of spectacular impact.  The audience is thrown straight into the action and through clever dialogue quickly becomes attached in some way (even if it be hate) to the characters.  We learn much of what we are shown before we are shown it, but our interest is not diluted because of Tarantino's proficiency at his craft. Credit must also go to the fantastic ensemble of actors who breathe life so vividly into their characters.   This effort supercedes all that Tarantino has done up until the time of writing.  Its curious and seemingly contradictory blend of amateur style shooting (No doubt caused by the seediness of the warehouse as the main locale) and yet ultimately professional final production make this a more INTENSE watch than 'Pulp Fiction' et al.  It's less about trying to be 'cool', and more about trying for naturalism, with 'cool' nevertheless still being the inevitable result.   A film that's impossible to ignore if you have any love for cinema as a medium.  You may hate it, but it would be foolish to deny that it deserves its place in film history as being a monumental surprise when it was released.   In my opinion, this is classic film-making from the modern era.",10,1,3,17 February 2002
Pretty Woman," Who knew it was so much fun to be a hooker? :-/
","I had to use that tag line as my summary because I only saw it printed in black and white just now, and I couldn't believe that anyone exists who has enough chutzpah to consider using it! That's Hollywood for you, I suppose... How to commit a marketing bungle in one simple step.Anyway, that hideous misjudgement is one of the only things that 'Pretty Woman' gets wrong. It knows it's a fairytale and perfectly casts its own princess and Prince Charming to tell it. Most would agree that there's such a genuine innocence and sweetness about Julia Roberts when she smiles that it's easy to overlook how she's worlds away from the typical mold of a streetwalker.Don't worry though, not everyone in this story is so gosh-darn wholesome. Sarcastic best friend Kit and snivelling little worm Stuckey are on hand to ground proceedings in reality at least a little bit. Kit in particular is a memorable confidante for our heroine, and makes me reflect that it's a hearty shame Laura San Giacomo never became a bigger star.It's so gladdening to find a film that knows its characters so well that it can make us see past their profession and appreciate them as people. I have a feeling that the personalities involved hold the secret to the delightful charm it possesses, too.",7,0,0,1 August 2007
Pulp Fiction," Screams 'Style!' all the way...
","... Let's clear one thing up first: I happen to believe that this movie is not as good as 'Reservoir Dogs'. 'RD' had a clearly defined story and aim. I'm not so sure this does. It feels more like an exercise by Mr Tarantino, demonstrating just how audacious he can be. Is there anything wrong with such flashiness when the result is this entertaining? Not in the slightest.'The Gold Watch' segment did nothing for me, and in my opinion should have been left out of the final cut, much as I like Christopher Walken. The rest of the movie without exception is a tour de force of controlled direction (Tarantino always knows where the film is going, even if his audience doesn't) understated but powerful acting, and moments of bizarre humour. I could quote the dialogue verbatim here, but there is simply too much quality and not enough space.This was also Sam Jackson's breakout role. For that we should be thankful, because the man is 'star quality' personified...No amount of superlatives can come close to encapsulating the feeling that most of you will get when watching the movie for the first time. It is an absorbing experience, almost like you have stepped into a much cooler VR sim of real life. Repeated viewings do not seem to dull its stark vitality.Those of you who abhor it for its casual attitude to violence miss out on its good points that DO NOT contain violence; namely, realistic yet captivating dialogue, flawless character development and bravura directing. It is much more than the glorification of gangsters and their subculture, a la 'Lock, Stock... ' and its ilk.Calling it the best movie ever made is hollow and unsubstantiated praise that I will not garner it with. One thing that can not be denied is that from its arrival it changed our perceptions of what cinema can mean to all people.Despite this, as I said, I don't think it can compare equally with 'Reservoir Dogs'...",10,1,2,25 January 2002
Titanic," Yes, the script is a bit soggy, yes, the two leads are eye candy, yes, this is still a stunning film. *****
","OK, so the script is weak. OK, so the two leads are acknowledged as being very good looking. Do these two points detract from the overall quality of the film? Not really.Being an aspiring screenwriter myself, I am usually the first to complain if the script is packed with corny lines. However, I class James Cameron as a maker of 'Event' movies, and for the purpose of big budget blockbusters all that really matters is that the script pushes all the right emotional buttons. This one does. Despite not being a consummate wordsmith, Jim knows how to manipulate an audience so that they're cryin' at the soppy parts and gaspin' at the thrilling bits. So, in that sense, any minor script faults don't really come into it.What people also forget is that both Leo & Kate are actually good performers. Before this, Kate cut her acting teeth in weighty period adaptations like 'Jude', and Leo did a good job of bringing his interpretation of one of the Bard's classic characters to the big screen.This is, as I've said, an event movie, and they don't come much bigger in scale or scope.",9,1,2,7 February 2001
Thor," Taking one of the seven basic plots, but making it apply to comic books, the real world, and beyond...
","I feel that the sequel to this movie is almost destined to flop, if a deal can't be agreed that sees Kenneth Branagh return to direct.... Initially I thought handing him the job was a mistake, but after judging on the merits of the entire film, I'm confident that I totally understand the choice... Both he and one of his stars (Anthony Hopkins) know how to sell bombastic speeches and make them inspirational rather than hyperbolic. Some people don't understand the intrinsic link between Shakespeare and comic-books (numerous academics have stated that if Shakespeare were alive today, then in their opinion he would be writing serials/soap operas... ) If they don't get someone in charge who knows how to grace age-old themes with a light touch, then Thor 2 could well sink like a stone... This is an epic in the truest sense of the word, just with CGI to fill in the story pockets that exist around the basic accomplishment of goals... If the technology had existed to create awe-inspiring sights using machinery, then it's not unreasonable to think that the storytellers of their time would have used them... Good old fashioned grand conflict never changes, though, and Branagh seems to have an instinctive understanding of this principle.",9,1,2,31 January 2012
The Godfather: Part III," Focuses more on who we all know is the TRUE main character of the series, and that's why it's my favourite.
","Castigate me if you will for saying this, but I believe part 3 to be the best of the series.  It's a very close run thing, with each film receiving the same rating from me (8), but it benefits from being a more intense study of ONE character rather than trying to divide its time between several, as the other two did.  That character of course is Michael Corleone; and when he's played by an actor of such class as Pacino, the movie can't fail. Michael has always been the most interesting character of the series for me, and is the fulcrum around which the entire series revolves; more so than Marlon Brando, who was nevertheless the first to essay the character of 'the Don'.  It's fascinating to watch events unfold now that he is finally a willing head of the 'family', trying to emulate his father.I did as is recommended and watched all 3 consecutively, so my ultimate preference for this one can't be explained by having forgotten how good the other two were.  IMO, this is a superior film on its own merits, which have nothing to do with the 15yr (I think) gap between sequels.Andy Garcia is a great addition to the cast as the cocksure Vincent, and Sophia Coppola, despite what you may have heard, is fine here too as Mary.She is also very beautiful.The entire trilogy is a series which demands to be seen by all those who call themselves film fans, and the third is not a blight on the other two, but rather a quality addition that enriches far more than it detracts.",8,88,182,15 May 2001
Die Hard," An undisputed classic. (SPOILERS)
","The best of the trilogy (although 'DHWAV' is also great), 'Die Hard' succeeds because its characters all seem like real people; as opposed to indestructible superheros and moustache-twirling villains.  John MClane has an argument with his wife just before all hell breaks loose, but we don't lose sympathy with him even though he's a bit of a jerk, and the scene where he tells Al Powell to give a message to Holly is extraordinarily touching. Time has obviously been spent on the script so it's not just a ragtag collection of one-liners (There are a few priceless ones in there, though) This has a great effect on the viewer because it gives us an actual story rather than a string of setpieces.   I don't need to go on about the performance of Bruce Willis.  He IS John MClane.  He's also a very under-rated actor who just happens to have been in his share of clunkers.  Rickman is superb as the nefarious bad guy Hans Gruber; at times he seems like he's chewing the scenery (when the script calls for it) but at other times he's the perfect example of underplayed menace.  Others of note are Paul Gleason ('The Breakfast Club') and Hart Bochner as the slimy Ellis.  Particularly good on the side of the terrorists is Alexander Godunov.  One of my favourite scenes is the almost climactic fight between McClane and Karl.  You really believe that they hate each other as Willis spits out: 'You shoulda heard your brother squeal when I broke his f***in neck!'   One of the best things about this film is that just when you think a certain scene can't be topped for pure excitement; McTiernan unleashes the next rocket from his arsenal and you are blown away once again.  The last 10 minutes or so (starting from when McClane gets onto the roof) are a delirious whirl of spectacular stunts.  This truly is one action ride you'll never forget.  Show me a better Hollywood action film and I'll call you a liar... It just doesn't get better than this.",10,0,0,26 April 2001
Rosemary's Baby," Breeding Ground.
","Given the well-documented trauma that enveloped his personal life as the Swinging Sixties were drawing to a close, it's perhaps unsurprising that Polanski chose to oversee a loose trilogy about madness taking hold in grim city environs. Of the three films in that canon, my personal preference leans toward 'The Tenant', but 'Rosemary's Baby' still remains an unnerving peephole that casts its view over urban paranoia.It's a film that best rewards repeat viewing, as the subtle intricacies of the script can be assimilated properly once the viewer is made fully aware of the diabolical plot at the film's end. If you're at all interested in the philosophies of mind-control or subjugation, then the horror may well deepen. Leave out the supernatural details which are specific to this story, and you'll nevertheless find that 'insistent coercion' is a hallmark of many dubious sects across the world.When he gets it right, Polanski is a master at immersing his audience in the fears of the character on screen. If you're a person who is susceptible to shivers brought on by isolation, then after seeing this you may need to sleep with the light on for awhile...",7,0,2,8 May 2007
War of the Worlds," Good show, but not nearly as 'earth-shaking' as you might expect...
","... It reminded me of 'Titanic' in a lot of ways; you can see where all the money's gone; and a number of the visuals are quite simply fantastic. We know Spielberg can handle a set-piece; but for me, since the early days of films like Jaws he's comparatively lacking in the ability to marry such talent with the due care and attention required for a script. Give him a 'little' film, and he'll explore wider issues; let him loose on a blockbuster these days, and he goes for the showier moments to the detriment of other pleasures. Those of you who've seen 'The Lost World' might get what I'm trying to say.'Titanic' was a big film where the script took a backseat, and so is the case here. Of course, that doesn't mean there isn't some enjoyment to be had from what's on offer - and those just looking to marvel at the spectacle won't give a hoot; but why assemble a cast with such big-hitters, when there's not much thought behind their actions beyond 'look panicked'? At times it feels like a loosely disguised retrospective of Spielberg's past numbers, too; riffing on all the things you'd expect, like 'Close Encounters' and 'Jurassic Park'. Why 'revisit' though, when such ground has already been covered? I hate to whine too much when something looks as good as this does; but it sorta feels like a step backward for Steven, after the looser, more 'experimental' style he's shown us with his recent work...",7,1,4,2 July 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Eschews the subtle approach.
","Francis Ford Coppola's attempt at bringing the classic novel to the big screen is a resounding failure. As so many others have commented before me, if it had been called by another name he MIGHT have gotten away with it. As it is, the movie bears almost no relation to the original text.Coppola seems to think he's orchestrating a lavish stage musical rather than attempting to produce a 120 minute movie. The sets and costumes are fabulous, but almost all of the cast ham up their performances dreadfully. Only Ryder seems to have any tangible idea of her character profile. It was she who originally took the script to Francis Ford Coppola; it was otherwise going to be a TV-movie. From the looks of this, it should have stayed in that format. It truly is 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show Part II' - only without the irony.Gary Oldman delivers a performance as the titular Count which - while not completely awful - is decidedly poor by his standards. The less said about Keanu's accent the better; although I can see why they cast him purely on looks. Hopkins is merely average as Van Helsing.The film is way too cluttered to take seriously, and as far as I could assess, the copious sex and nudity served no thematic purpose whatsoever. It did however, manage to keep my interest amidst all the silly theatrics. Coppola fails to treat the source legend with the respect it deserves and instead directs like a hyperactive kid let loose in a toy shop, brutally destroying the merchandise. It's laughable when you consider what he had to work with. Actually, no; it makes me want to cry.",3,4,7,11 May 2001
"Hail, Caesar!"," The Hollywood Empire...
","According to the studios, movie stars and their audience are like mushrooms - for best results, keep them in the dark, and... well, you know the rest.Casting a wry eye at the machinations of Hollywood is familiar territory for the Coens, and once again, they handle it most assuredly.Meanwhile, George Clooney's continued willingness to skewer his own image brings me much joy.",6,0,0,5 September 2017
Kingpin," Gets better as it goes along.
","This is a comedy that at the start threatens to become overburdened by - of all things - a plot.  Too much time is spent on developing the characters and manouvering them into the situation that will become the driving force of the movie.  About halfway through, when all of this has been done, the movie's tone finally settles down into a steady stream of gags.  The rewards that follow make it well worth the effort of sticking with it during the opening.  There are at least three jokes over the running time that deserve to be recognised as all time classics, if not more.   As has so often happened, the Farrelly brothers have managed to extract creditable performances from all four leads.  Bill Murray steals the show, but then, I don't think I've ever seen a movie where he hasn't.  The guy is a comedy legend, 'nuff said.  Quaid manages to imbue a real sensitive sweetness into what would otherwise be just a stupid character.  Ishmael IS stupid, but he's stupid with a heart of gold, and the Farrelly brothers again manage to handle the material with enough sensitivity that most moviegoers will be shocked, but not necessarily offended.   This, 'Dumb & Dumber' and 'There's Something About Mary' are the Farrelly brothers' GOOD movies.  'Me, Myself & Irene' is not in the same class.",8,1,2,28 November 2001
Hancock," In the end it amounts to no name and no number. No distinguishing or remarkable characteristics, just Will Smith playing dishevelled.
","An individual possessing superpowers who isn't exactly morally respectable is a great idea. If in their wisdom the makers had decided to expand upon that and excise their half-baked attempt at staging a mythical romance to occupy the movie's second half, then I feel that Hancock could have been a lot more enjoyable. Besides the fact that the love story we're given doesn't suit the whole 'cynical perspective' an awful lot and feels like a misguided and abortive attempt to please all of the people all of the time, the fundamental basics of how it's written just don't make sense...They're supposed to weaken one another, and yet she's still able to throw him through a window (or whatever it is that she does when they first get close) after having been around him a good deal of time, already. Funny how you're able to summon up these feats of strength in one instance, and yet conveniently be near enough helpless at a time when the writers decide that their audience will need some 'peril'. To me, this discrepancy is an elementary flaw that isn't adequately explained away, and smacks of a storyline cobbled together hastily to meet a demographically-targeted release date.I hadn't mentioned the misgivings of mine to any of my companions on the night that we saw it only because I assumed it was just me that found it so ridiculously, glaringly obvious. I'm happy to know now from other confused and disappointed users of IMDb that it wasn't I who had lost the plot - Hancock managed to get into that state all by itself.It's fun on a big scale when all it's trying to do is invert standard heroic situations to gain laughs. When it gracelessly tried to switch gears and suddenly become solemn, that's about when I stopped wanting to fly along for the ride.",6,8,16,7 July 2008
Hitch," Here's the 'Hitch' - we don't need this whole thing...
","... Watching this reminded me of those old Doris Day confections that this film desperately wants to be like; you know, the kind of thing where the dapper columnist wines and dines their target in search of the perfect 'expose', only to wind up falling for them in the process... Then I thought back to previous modern-day interpretations. Guess what? I couldn't come up with any. The closest I got was 'Down with Love'; which technically doesn't count, since it's more of a sly tribute than a fresh look...Now there's Hitch, though; and it demonstrates perfectly why this type of tale isn't really attempted, anymore. In this day and age, we have all sorts of conveniences to help the romantically inept - not least of which is the Internet; and the film never managed to convince me why people in need of help would turn to Hitch over more anonymous - and less expensive - alternatives...I guess the answer that's closest to the truth, if not actually overtly spelt out, is 'because he's Will Smith'. There again, the producers (included Will himself) have sensed a soft target of ladies who usually swoon, and guys who normally laugh, at the 'Fresh Prince' himself; 'cept that wasn't how it went down - at least not for me.It must have seemed like an all-too-safe bet to attach Will Smith to a romantic comedy and let him breeze through scenes with his easy charm and flair for drawing a chuckle. So much so that the end result is HORRENDOUSLY 'pre-packaged'; with his role not being so much a character as a marketing man's idea of how best to sell 'Will the Romantic'. I was left feeling short-changed because I wanted some real personal insight; instead the effort was to sell me the same superficial patter as his desperate potential clients - only I wasn't buying...That's the predictable romance covered; and because it's a different genre, the script doesn't make an effort to give us a whole lot of laughs, either. The attitude seems to be: 'Well, we've written the romance, and we've got Will to make people laugh... ', but in truth; there's not much for him to work with.This is apparently an indicator of things to come; a preview of what will happen when Mr. Smith hangs up his 'cape', and stops trying to save the world. He supposedly made the switch on the advice of his son. Well maybe when the lad gets older he'll realise that this is NOT the best way for affairs of the heart to resolve themselves; being as it is commercial and insincere, when what the real softies amongst us would like to see more of are great big helpings of emotional truth...",4,1,2,29 June 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Ritchie's best film? Elementary, of course!
","Some of the sleuthing was very 'Hollywood'. There didn't appear to be much in the way of foreshadowing for viewers who like to play along and solve the mystery with Holmes step-by-step (I don't happen to be one of those people, however, so I didn't mind ) Downey's chemistry with the rest of the cast was excellent. The production design was great, and there were one or two stunning set-pieces carefully crafted and choreographed within the story.Mark Strong did very well with what seemed to me to be a very underwritten bad guy So much time is spent upon establishing the relationship between Holmes and Watson and setting up the mystery, that the villain's motivation and grand master plan doesn't receive the depth of explanation it perhaps warrants. This facet of the plot is pretty much dealt with in its entirety using only one scene.For those seeking more of an action-adventure than a procedural, this should be a treat. Stands in my opinion as Guy Ritchie's best film yet (although since I didn't like him much in the first place, that's perhaps not saying much!)",7,2,5,5 January 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," A great film, but #2?
","A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?One user put it very well when they said that the film's essential message of 'the human spirit conquering all' is very uplifting an' everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridan's 'In the Name of the Father' springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's also true.Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly can't agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.#2 of 250?

Platoon," A series of build-ups with no climax...
","... I figure that Stone must have been smoking some of the same grass that the characters do in this movie to end up with a product like this. Sure, it's beautifully filmed, but really, all it is when you come right down to it is a bunch of Americans sitting around, getting drunk and stoned, and talking bull. Occasionally something actually happens/explodes, but then Stone goes into hyperactive camera mode. It might be authentic from the perspective that none of the troops knew what was going on either; but it's frustrating for an audience member trying to piece together some sense from this garbled mosaic that says 'War is hell!' in between long pulls on a 'J'.None of the cast are particular standouts either, ranging from 'going through the motions' to pitifully bad.It is rare that I have had to endure such a boring experience from an otherwise regarded classic. It is beyond me how this won so many awards and so much acclaim.",4,3,8,17 January 2002
Prometheus," Honour thy father...
","(Sitting here now having seen it, it feels like the very act of even talking about Prometheus constitutes a spoiler, because so much of the pleasure I gained from the film came from thinking about the ideas behind it. I've tried not to deliberately reveal specific details, but I've checked the 'spoiler' box, just in case! It's actually better if you go in knowing nothing, and trying not to let Ridley Scott's past sci-fi experience influence you)I thought it was excellent (although from the looks of things on the message board, that doesn't appear to be a view that's unanimously endorsed!)It's really hard to say a lot about it without spoiling it... I thought the visuals were astonishing (I saw it in 3D, which enhances the experience) and I really liked the philosophy it opened up (however much they might have been holding details back for a continuation of the theme) The two main criticisms appear to be that there isn't much character depth, and also, not as much out and out alien action as people were expecting. To counter those perceived weaknesses, I would say that the story very purposefully sets up its human elements as an enormously distant third priority, behind two more powerful agents... and that whilst there definitely is a greater scope beyond simply alien battles, if you're interested in the series then there's a link to where the xenomorphs were generated, and what their function could possibly be interpreted as...Lots of avenues left open for exploration in a future sequel, which I would be very intrigued to see!",10,3,14,6 July 2012
Carrie," Intelligent film that's more than just a horror flick...
","...Due in part to the amazing subtlety of Spacek's performance.  The last 20 minutes is when the real scares start, so we'd better have something to hold our interest until then, and we do.  A convincing portrayal of high school (albeit pretty dated, hey, this is the '70s!) and a subtle showing of Carrie's telekinetic ability.  Sure, De Palma used up all the subtlety by the time he got to the finale but that's one of the reasons why the film is so interesting.   (SPOILERS)   Piper Laurie is great too as the religious fanatic of a mother.  She really gives me the creeps!  William Katt is also good as Tommy Ross, building up such a good rapport with Carrie by the end of the movie that we feel genuinely horrified as the denouement begins.  This is also another point in the film's favour.  We're unsure  whether to cheer as the horrendously bullied Carrie gets her revenge, or be horrified at the destruction she wreaks, since some quite sympathetic characters also fall foul of her wrath (the gym teacher for one).  A nice test of audience sympathies, that.   Deserves to be regarded as one of the classics of modern horror, and showcased De Palma's potential for those of us who weren't familiar with his earlier work.  Excellent.",10,0,0,9 March 2001
Raging Bull," What do you do with a bull? You get him in the ring...
","It seems fairly self-evident to me, but at least one review I've read has tried to write otherwise: This isn't a boxing movie. We see a few fights, but the result that goes into the record books isn't as important as the mental toll taken by the running battles waged outside the ring. What it's implied that boxing meant to Jake La Motta is a release of all the pent up frustration and insecurities that destroy his relationships. Pugilism is a healthy, controlled outlet for his anger, but remove him from that sporting environment and he's as dangerous as a bull would be if it began roaming the streets...It is entirely likely that there are no excuses to explain the development of such a man. Perhaps the best thing to do when you realise you have a time-bomb on your hands is to try to plot the path which will cause least destruction, channeling that force and at least putting it to some kind of purpose. Gaining admiration for such a volatile personality probably wasn't high on the list of priorities going into production. It's a despairing situation to document, but an unflinching and fascinating one at that. This is raw celluloid power, restrained for our study as best as can be done.",10,3,5,30 May 2007
Step Up," Misses the Plate...
","Only notable for the chemistry between its two leads... In terms of theme, 'Dirty Dancing' or even 'Save the Last Dance' is much better.Any attempt at dramatic tension makes itself known far too late to save the film, and just feels like a cheap afterthought, because it's an expected part of 'the formula'.How such laziness made enough money to spawn a franchise is beyond me.Boy am I glad that Channing graduated to working with Soderbergh, Tarantino and the Coens... because he looks uncomfortable with the false earnestness asked of him here - probably because it's so inauthentic.",4,0,1,16 December 2017
Iron Man," Iron and Wine - Like a flavoursome bouquet, Downey appears to only get better with age...
","These morally compromised times all but demand that a morally compromised anti-hero be allowed to stand at their centre, and there are moments when an audience member is left to reflect that the alter-ego Tony Stark could almost have been specifically created for Robert Downey, Jr. He brings the full weight of his experience to bear on a part that seems almost to become like a second skin for him, at times. Not to imply that the task of assuming a dual identity should be viewed as a burden. Far from it. RDJ is clearly having fun with the chance to put his quirky sensibilities to use in more mainstream fare again, now that he is older and wiser. There are many who would have doubtless echoed the sentiment that he is 'not the superhero type' when news of his enlistment first broke, but here he proves beyond any doubt that he fits this particular bill perfectly.Alloyed (geddit?!) to a couple of instances of fine casting, there is a story that surprisingly manages to successfully combine an almost fetishistic celebration of badass technology with the altogether simpler drama of human dilemma. We are given a mini robot war at the film's climax for example, that knocks the ENTIRETY of last year's 'Transformers' squarely on its backside, and demonstrates deftly to Michael Bay the opportunity for emotional investment that he so obviously missed.This is a serving of pre-summer fun with a fair bit of heart behind the machinery. If you're after a blockbuster that boasts a respectable quota of acting talent to its name, then I think you'll find this is one confection knocked together that actually polishes up rather well! Like Iron Man itself, then.",8,5,10,9 May 2008
X2: X-Men United," The original set up an intelligent treatment focused on 'character'...
","... which the sequel then junked for the usual silly superhero theatrics and vapid set-pieces. Some people criticised X-Men because they thought it didn't have enough action - I liked that it focused more on 'dialogue' and 'mood'... X2 went too far in the opposite direction, for my liking. To put it into perspective, I also liked 'The Hulk' for the same reasons most people hated it... ! The first installment was duty-bound to do sterling work establishing the players and examining their various back-stories. For the most part that isn't necessary here, and so I felt that it just wasn't dealt with satisfactorily AT ALL - even for party newcomers like Nightcrawler. Any trace of subtlety is pretty much swamped by the traditional gung-ho heroism now that the majority of the group know each other better.The many interesting relationships of the first (such as that between Wolverine and Rogue) are not given anywhere near the attention they deserve in order to cram in more physically astonishing feats. Your average teenage moviegoer will love this (as proved by the high rating here) but I've seen it all before; and to see the series regress to aping countless other summer blockbusters when it began by celebrating differences, (literally) was more than a little dispiriting to experience...",2,4,8,20 July 2005
RED," Code Red...
","It's a one-joke movie, and the joke is ancient - pun intended - 'Old people are good at stuff; hur hur!' ...Even the positive reviews I've seen of this only mention the great cast (which is true, even though they're all FAR too good for this kind of thing) and 'Helen Mirren with a machine gun' ... I mean, the latter is NOVEL, sure... but, really?! That's all you guys want from a movie? You don't want, like, interesting characters, or a decent script that's more than tired one-liners and a jumble-sale of clichés?Knock yourself out, I guess... It's 'Cocoon with guns'. I want to see more distinguished people in movies, but not when all they're there for is to prove that they can plod through exactly the same moronic drivel as the younger crowd... They really should be old enough to know better!",4,2,5,10 November 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," My favourite horror movie. I doubt I'll ever see anything to surpass it.
","My memories of this film reach back about as far as for any other movie out there. I remember sitting in my grandparents darkened back room when I was about six, no older than seven. I asked my uncle what scary film he was starting to watch, and he told me this title. The very first shot we see is absolutely masterful, it almost has the feel of a counterfeit recording, although I can assure you it wasn't. Freddy and his homemade 'item', then a jumpy credits sequence replete with haunting music. It's the most effective way to open a horror story that I believe I can think of...Mostly the proceedings are kept tightly organised from thereon in. It's worth mentioning that I've never happened upon any male fans complaining about the plot featuring a teenage girl as the most resourceful character. It's a welcome change, and thankfully due to good scripting it never feels like a mistake or a crass gimmick. The ratio of 'dumb' victims is less than usual, too - you can't really blame them for succumbing to a predator who attacks them within the realm of their subconscious. The back story of the real Kreuger - let alone his spiritual manifestation - is sickening enough to conjure up some serious shivers. If I was nitpicking I'd say that the climax felt a bit rushed, but that hardly mattered considering that everything had been handled so well up until then, and this slight dip is more than compensated for by a terrific last shot, anyway. Finally, how could I fail to adore a fright-fest featuring the reliable and reassuring presence of the legend John Saxon as a concerned father? It ticks all the boxes, I tells ya!So much thought appears to have gone into the concept, and it's this attention to detail that helps it resonate. Freddy's sweater, for example, red and green because those colours clash horrifically... No wonder this sleeper effort put New Line on the map. It was the studio house that Freddy built, and it kick started my realisation that movies could leave a lasting imprint on the mind. 9-10, never sleep again? Someone should have told that to all of the directors who deputised for Craven, because disappointingly they were found to be asleep at the reins of a franchise that had been given such a roaring start.",10,0,1,13 June 2007
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," The title says it all...
","... This is indeed a wickedly fun ride. Just because the film's two main characters are lovable doofuses doesn't mean the comedy in the script can't have a brain, and it has lots of fun with the perceived stereotypes of a variety of historical figures. The film's premise is some form of bizarre genius, but the fact that it consistently manages to swap timezones whilst always maintaining some sense of narrative direction is an all too rare achievement for fantasy stories.Amidst all this hectic back and forth, to have it find time for throwaway running gags at all is impressive, but how funny they actually are in practice is nothing short of remarkable! My favourite is Bill's own pressing Oedipal dilemma, and the psychologically based funnies don't end there, as along the way the duo run into old Mr. Sigmund Freud himself! 'How's it going, Frood-dude!', they exclaim...To conclude, I'm almost as excited over this film as Bill and Ted are about WYLD STALLYNS!!!!!!!!!!!! *triumphant air-guitar*",8,0,0,25 July 2007
The Matrix," Cut out the philosophical claptrap, just accept it for what it is: an awesome spectacle. *****
","There are films that it is worthwhile to spend hours musing over, as to whether the film offers any deep spiritual insights or teaches us something new about the world.  In my opinion, this ain't one of them.  There are no 'hidden truths' to be found, no startling insights, just an amazing action flick that on its release delivered thrills 'n' spills unlike any audiences had seen before.One comment I read mentioned that audiences can 'cheer' for the hero.  I disagree.  Keanu Reeves brings little more to the role than the ability to look cool dressed all in black.  Not that he gives a bad performance, just that there is little empathy there.In this case, though, that hardly matters.  What impresses is simply that we are given something new to see and not merely an uninspiring rehash of a thousand action cliches that we've seen put to better use elsewhere.In short, an awesome spectacle.",9,0,0,7 February 2001
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Nudge nudge, wink wink ...
","I like the 'finishing school' aspects of it... If the tone had been more ruthless, instead of playful, its criticism of the elites could have been interesting. As it is, it's wasted.Give me a serious spy movie any day, though. I don't share Mr. Vaughan's juvenile sensibility. I can appreciate the place that violence and profanity have in cinema - I just don't think they're 'cool' any more, because I'm no longer 12 (36, tomorrow).I am literally too old for this sh-- ... It's too violent for kids, but it's too silly for adults (and no, 'Kick Ass' and the campy Bond films never worked for me, either).When you flag up your in jokes as they're used, it doesn't make them endearing, it just makes them trite. You're drawing too much attention and trying too hard, instead of being suave.Don't kid yourself, Matthew. It's EXACTLY that kind of movie. You just can't resist.",5,1,2,11 September 2017
Apollo 13," Another Hanks attempt to monopolise the Oscar...
","'Apollo 13' is yet another movie where Hanks is cast as the 'everyman' overcoming some difficulty.  He IS a fine actor, and 'Apollo 13' IS a great film, but does anyone else get the urge to see Tom Hanks playing a real scumbag for once?  His characters always seem so WORTHY, making them a cert for Academy nomination at least.  Sometimes I wish he'd be a little more brave in his career choices.  Academy recognition aint the be all and end all.  There are plenty of fine actors never to be recognised in such a way. I think I'm right in suggesting Johnny Depp? Still, onto the film.   Director Howard has assembled a superb ensemble cast, and has a decent script to work from.  Everybody should know the basic story by now but this fact is impressively never allowed to destroy dramatic tension.  No-one with any sense would label Howard an auteur, and this works well for A13 because it allows us to concentrate on the individuals IN FRONT of the camera rather than the guy behind it (take note Scorsese.)  The moods in this picture are impressively judged, the historic build up (which admittedly does drag slightly), the perilous middle and the triumphant end.  The effects are superb, but they aren't the only thing here, making this a true blockbuster with soul.  The crew on the ground, led by Ed Harris, are almost as impressive as those in space, if not more so.  The whole production has obviously been polished until it gleamed...   Definitely Ron Howard's best film, and one of the best pictures of '95. As I mentioned before, I just wish the Academy weren't so obvious in their Oscar choices...   Incidentally, I didn't like this film when I first saw it.  Never has it been more apparent that your taste and attention span increase as you get older!",9,0,0,9 March 2001
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Vampires never looked so good... (POTENTIAL FOR SPOILAGE.)
","... in an aesthetic sense, I mean. For whilst the production design, costumes and photography are all lavish, this is a world away from the iconic, rock star status bestowed on vamps in such previous movies as '80's teen classic 'The Lost Boys' for instance. (Quite ironic, really, given that I've just read that Lestat becomes a rock star in the follow up: 'Queen of the Damned') The life of these vampires is shown to be all surface glitz, hiding the inexorable loneliness they feel at being the only ones around on the earth to witness life go through all its changes. The beauty of this movie is that you can take it anyway you want though; you can see it as a character study, straightforward thriller or period piece. It is ALL of these things, in fact, bound up in one glorious whole.Allaying the fears of many an Anne Rice fanboy/girl (and even the author herself) when his casting was announced, Tom Cruise does fine in the pivotal role of Lestat de Lioncourt, an embittered, aristocratic and charismatic vampire who serves as a ghoulish guide to Louis (Brad Pitt) into the world of the undead. The common misconception is that Cruise can't act, you see, but he CAN. Unfortunately, he's just cursed with that 'idiot grin' so accurately skewered by the villain in MI:2. Still, gleaming gnashers aside, he's given many a good performance, and this is actually one of his best.The rising star that was then Brad Pitt also does fine, although some wags (like me) will no doubt simply label his character 'a miserablist g*t'. It is Kirsten Dunst who waltzes away with the acting honours here though, delivering a frighteningly mature performance at such a young age. She really does look young here, and not like the lovely lady who sets this reviewer's heart a-flutter these days. I noticed a trend amongst users before me to categorise her character Claudia as 'evil'. I don't really understand this. She just seemed to me to be quite understandably PO'd that Lestat and Louis had stolen her childhood. (or rather, prolonged it interminably.) Besides, her companions are hardly paragons of virtue themselves, are they? Even Louis caves in the end... E-mail me if you feel you can shed any light on this issue.Perennial Jordan favourite Rea also shows up. Then there's Antonio Banderas, whose character Armand doesn't really work at all. Also look out for Thandie Newton (yes, Mr Cruise's love object in the aforementioned MI:2) and Christian Slater, in a role undeserving of such a big name, which was probably only allocated to him in order to further 'up' the male totty factor.There are several lavish setpieces on display, which work splendidly thanks to the invariably good acting and magnificent sets, and it's interesting to see a characters life explored that we don't usually get much insight into, beyond the usual garlic-phobic clichÃ©s. For unadulterated horror fans, though, it's not really THAT scary; more a methodical exploration than an all out gorefest. It's all treated with the usual elegance by Jordan, who seems the perfect director to enliven Anne Rice's material because of his artistic sensibilities. So much so, in fact, that I had to abandon the exercise of reading the novel after seeing the film, because the movie had become the definitive version in my head, overshadowing everything that came from the true author's pen.It is a shame, therefore, that I have been denied an aspect of my literary education by the film, but my movie-loving faculties have been stimulated instead. A wonderful film, see it if you haven't already.",9,1,2,17 January 2002
Joy," Chutzpah...
","She asks her father for a favour... and it isn't even HIS money! She only sells to begin with because a friend manufactures a call to ease her into her spiel, and she blames her sister because the parts makers overcharge... I don't know about innovation, but all those things definitely take some big, brass balls! All of her success with the WonderMop is down to other people's sacrifices.It's kind of a dispiriting message, if what it tells us is people with this kind of chutzpah are the only ones who ever really succeed in business, even when they're ordinary... You look at the details, and there's not much cause for elation, at all...There's certainly something to be said for a wipe-clean sense of shame, though!",6,0,1,5 September 2017
True Romance," Just how far would you go for love?
","Well, if you're a guy like Clarence, then it would seem the answer is 'Pretty far!'. He's a nice enough guy who doesn't have much luck with the ladies, so when Alabama walks into his life it seems like there's going to be strings attached... and there are. Through it all, however, the passion of the young wins through. If that sounds like it's going to be a little too weepy and predictable for the guys though, then you have the wrong film. 'TR' is smart, sassy and brutal, with an all star cast and notable director delivering the goods at a fast and furious pace.Things settle into a more traditional and familiar vibe in the last quarter, but until then the delightful surprises come completely out of left field. Any scene from the first third, you could take on its own and make another different movie from. To that end, I say commission another script focusing on Gary Oldman's 'Drexl', now!! It's nothing short of amazing how the British chameleon takes the character on the page and makes him come alive like you've never seen before! The dialogue is good, but his distinctive accent and appearance make this all about creating a memorably loathsome individual from the ground up. Brad Pitt actually performs a similar feat too - as the lovable stoner 'Floyd' - with only slightly less impact.I love this film so much because it's full of some of the best characters you'll find in crime cinema. Let them take you on a journey with them, and you're liable to find yourself wrung out at the end of it.",10,2,4,23 August 2007
Gladiator," Brings new meaning to the word 'epic'...
","It's been a while since we've had a blockbuster live up to the hype. This did, despite there being little hype to speak of originally. Now everyone is talking about it, and with good reason. The cast and crew have turned in a fine film.Crowe is magnificent as the central figure of Maximus. Along with an imposing figure, he brings acting skill to the role when many would have simply been tempted to essay the 'action hero' caricature we've seen many times before. Crowe is wonderfully competent at being both the classic 'hero' type and the man with a bit more depth behind the brawn. This role must surely have taken him to the front ranks of Hollywood's leading men.Many of the other cast members perform extremely well too. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the sort of complex interpretation a figure of history such as Commodus doubtless deserves. No matter how much we may be rooting for Maximus, occasionally we feel sympathetic towards Commodus when he is at his most pitiful. This is a fine balance though, as never is any pity we may feel allowed to overshadow the fact that Commodus can also be spectacularly evil. I shall be watching the career of Phoenix more closely on the evidence of this performance.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Often, the efforts of the actresses go unnoticed in relation to their more high profile male counterparts. Not here, Connie Nielsen is also superb as a quiet heroine who the audience can will to get together with the hero.Oliver Reed is fine in his last role, but it is Richard Harris, who, as a member of the 'old guard', reminds us all that he's been doing this sort of thing effortlessly since Crowe was in nappies (probably...) A bravura performance.Ridley Scott, meanwhile, appears to relish a project of this magnitude. The CGI recreation of the Collosseum is magnificent, but Scott never lets such an impressive element detract from the moments of pure drama to be found in David H. Franzoni's script. Instead, he mixes astonishing set pieces with moments of human interaction seamlessly, creating a thoroughly nourishing and rewarding cinematic experience.Proof that they might just make 'em as good as they used to...?",9,1,1,12 March 2001
Contact," Intelligent movie-making, whichever way you cut it...
","I don't understand why some people make a distinction between science-fiction and sci-fi. Still, whatever you want to call 'Contact', it represents thoughtful, intelligent film-making.Jodie Foster is perfect for the role of Ellie Arroway. The character is written as an intelligent, articulate and passionate woman, just as Ms Foster herself appears to be. Sure, that doesn't require much of an acting stretch, and I think I've accidentally hit on the reason I don't like Foster much as an actress, despite most of her films and performances being good. You never get the sense that she is stepping outside herself to portray the character, her persona is always there. Her best role in my opinion is one of her first, as Iris in 'Taxi Driver', when nobody knew who she was and she couldn't trade off an established profile of herself, as she has done in much of her later work.(SPOILERS)Back to the film. 'Contact' is intelligently written, with an engaging cast of supporting characters besides Foster. Creditable actors such as Tom Skerrit and James Woods lend their considerable nous to the project. One of my favourite scenes (and lines) in the film is when they receive a transmission of the Nuremburg rally as proof that they have made 'contact'. Someone asks: 'What are they trying to say?'; one person offers that maybe it's just their way of saying 'Hello', 'Or seig heil, you're our kind of people...' inserts Woods' dour army general. Priceless.The script also does a good job of making science seem pretty interesting, for those of us who've never looked at it that way before (like me) The reaction of the general population when they hear about the news is a nice touch (Foster riding into a carnival-like atmosphere with speakers blaring out 'Purple people eater'), as are the cameos by various people, including ex Prez Bill Clinton. OK, they're not crucial in terms of plot development, but they do help to maintain the previous treatment of the subject matter as something that could really happen. In opposition to this is a movie like 'Armageddon', which, while fun and constantly hinting that it's scenario is possible, goes for the cheap thrills and one-liners rather than the cerebral route. (On a side note, I'm consistently amazed at how much of a bashing that movie takes from you venerable IMDb users, lighten up, guys!)What a shame, then, that all the hard work done in the first 2/3rds of the movie is almost undone by a contrived final third. Did the alien really have to take the form of her dead dad and spout off horribly sentimental platitudes? I could handle the vaguely moralising tone of the dialogue between young Ellie and her father at the beginning, because it seemed like a simple yet effective way of explaining why Ellie grew up to be such a forthright woman. Returning to the well again, however, is beyond the pale. It's an example of lazy scriptwriting to tie up any possible loose ends that I wouldn't have thought possible, given that otherwise the script is almost faultless. Hey, I LIKE loose ends sometimes, leave them alone!This pretty major gripe still isn't enough to prevent the film achieving a high mark on my ratings system, though. An impressively intelligent Hollywood treatment of a topical subject that should provoke reflection in its audience and stands up well to repeated viewings. Will deserve to be recognised as a modern classic 20 years after its release.",9,0,2,16 March 2001
The Pursuit of Happyness," It's a sucky life, and just when you think it can't suck anymore, it does.
","I get the feeling that this was produced just because Will Smith has the clout to open up pretty much anything in Hollywood. I can see why he would be attracted to the story; it gives him a great chance to promote all the values that are right in life - Work hard, have integrity, never give up etc, and you'll make it in the end. That's a very positive message and it might even be true, plus there's the fact that it looks all the better coming from someone who's already made it, themselves. The trouble is, it forgets all those everyday people watching who are neither poor nor rich, have no direction to go on the ladder and are just stuck in a rut. What does it say to those folk? From my own experience I'd have to report that the answer really is: 'Not much'.Don't get me wrong. It's nice to see someone who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and never gave up - even when they were truly at a low - it's nice to see a determined individual like that do well for themselves. Really it is. When the journey shown in getting to that goal is so relentlessly depressing and airless though, it drains a large part of the good intentions and morals from the story. If the most inspiring moment of the whole tale comes from reading the text of the coda on a black background at the end - without actually being shown evidence of this deserved success - then your film has problems. Mirroring what you're seeing in front of you, you spend all that time hoping for a good viewing experience, only to feel tripped up, over and over again.",5,11,18,18 February 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Perhaps not the most entertaining of the trilogy, but certainly the most complete... (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","It doesn't have the sense of wonder that 'Raiders...' had, because the character had already become a movie icon. It's not as breathlessly paced as 'Temple...' because the makers were working on the assumption that this was going to be the last, so they wanted to tie up some loose ends. I would suggest, however, that if you were to watch only ONE instalment from the trilogy, this would be the one to choose to give you the most compact flavour of what the series is like as a whole (I DON'T recommend you do this BTW. watch 'em all!)Asking me which of the trilogy is my favourite is an easier question than if you were asking me which is the best; 'ROTLA' is my fave, but every film appeals to different people because of the reasons I've listed above. I'm not going to even try comparing 'The Last Crusade' with its predecessors.What I can say about it is this: The introduction of Connery as Indy's father is a masterstroke. Actors as icons don't come much bigger than Sean.He works so well with Ford that you never think you're watching 'James Bond' and you buy the uneasy relationship the two have with each other. I have to say, this is more down to the skill of the two actors themselves than particularly masterful writing, but even so, it never feels false. This is quite an achievement, as it could easily have been deployed as just a one-note gimmick about the hardships of having parents.The opening sequence is terrific; a perfect intro for newcomers to the series, and more back-story for longtime fans. Phoenix was a perfect choice for Young Indy, and I'm sure he would have been the ideal man to step into Harrison's shoes permanently when he decided he was too old for the part. I can't understand why some people complain that it was contrived. The whole series is fairly contrived, relating as it does to the cliffhanger serials from the '30's & '40's. I see nothing in that segment that has a different tone to anything that has gone before it. So Indy climbing into Lao Che's plane at the start of 'Temple...' wasn't contrived?Some may justifiably complain that the set-pieces are perhaps not what we've come to expect from the franchise, but I feel this is a direct result of trying to introduce a more personal element with the relationship between the Jones's. They're still better than most other imitators in '80s cinema, and by now most of us love the main character so much we'd be rooting for him to thwart a slightly painful verruca... Maybe it is more sedate and less imaginative than its companions, but they were hardly BAD films, and perhaps a change in pace was needed. Still great.",9,0,0,25 March 2001
Back to the Future," Pure Movie Magic.
","One of the most genuinely enjoyable movies for enjoyment's sake.  I just cannot conceive how they could have made this a better movie.   It seems like Fox was born to play McFly, and try as he might, he can never get away from the part now.  Although he's done good work elsewhere, this is the one he'll be remembered for.  His defining role.   As someone else mentioned, Lloyd overacts, but somehow I never mind.  Lea Thompson has an indefinable quality, so I won't even try.  Crispin Glover is just wonderfully weird as George McFly.  No one could have played the role like him, and I think perhaps the reason the sequels suffer a bit in comparison to this one is his absence (tighter scripting would also have helped...)  Still, don't wanna give the guy a big head, 'cos when all's said and done he aint the star of the show...   What's also impressive about this is the attention to detail.  It would have been so easy to turn out a pale imitation of what we actually got with this premise, but thankfully the film-makers didn't.  Every little in-joke and movie reference adds to the created universe and involves us more with the characters.  Thanks guys, you can tell you had a lot of fun with this movie.   Also, there is no better director than Robert Zemeckis for creating escapist cinema.  This is a bona fide classic and will be no matter how far into the future you travel...",10,2,3,15 March 2001
The Birds," It MIGHT be 'terrifying' if I could buy it - but I can't...
","... and not just because of the effects. The characters are about as 'substantial' as birdseed, too; leading me to begin cheering for our 'feathered friends', instead! There's a term we use today for the 'singleminded' nature of the actions of Hedren's character Melanie Daniels - it's called 'stalking'!! Still, given that there just 'happens' to be someone else on the island who was drawn there by the weird and unexplained 'magnetism' of Taylor's character; it seems ALL of the inhabitants have been struck down by some form of 'bird flu' before our little tweeters even START to get 'nasty'! What we are led to believe is that he has some sort of 'coterie' going on down there - it's laughable.Hitchcock was too 'classy' to fall prey to the modern directorial syndrome of someone itching to get onto the next big 'setpiece', but here this usually masterful 'restraint' only became part of my problem: There was just nothing sufficiently 'interesting' or even likable about these characters to warrant my investment in the seemingly piffling problems of their lives; and when they DID start coming under 'siege', I can honestly say I was GLAD, more than anything! Save the absurd notion that this is somehow 'classic Hitch', or even a classic of its kind - that sort of 'kneejerk overreaction' to already inherently silly material is... well, 'for the birds', really! 5/10.",5,5,11,4 January 2005
Beetlejuice," 'What's my Name?'
","Whatever the story he's telling, Tim Burton - along with his collaborators - has the precise ability to create incredibly detailed universes and transport us to them at once, so that they feel like home for the duration of his tale. 'Beetlejuice' is no different. Within what feels like no time at all, we're taken inside a scale-model, before being whisked from there and placed right in the heart of quaint rural America, complete with white-picket fences and all. Our last stop on this magical mystery tour finally takes us to the afterlife, where we encounter various forms of the undead. It almost seems like an overload of imagination for one movie, but we're soon to discover that 'restraint' is far from what Beetlejuice is about...Both the production design and makeup are excellent tools with regard to making us believe totally in this assortment of landscapes. It's a sign of how much fun the movie has experimenting that when the titular character gets so little screen-time, we aren't complaining much, and it forces you to think just how many other movies would have been irreparably damaged by a similar decision. Michael Keaton is riotous, but there are laughs to be had from plenty of other sources too. All of the supporting cast are Burton favourites, and it's a telling indicator that here is where they do some of their best work.If you want spooky laughs, then get your mitts on 'Beetlejuice' and settle down to watch the exploits, because 'it's show time'... He truly is The Name In Laughter From The Hereafter!",8,1,2,19 July 2007
High Fidelity," Bittersweet analysis of relationships strikes a chord.
","Sorry about the lame musical pun in the summary (I swear it wasn't intended... !) but I truly found whilst watching High Fidelity that I connected strongly with the main character of Rob Gordon.  People here have said that they were turned off the movie because Rob is shallow, selfish, melancholic and anal (A bit worrying, since I said I identified with him!) but in my opinion, it's one of the first movies to show men & women as they actually ARE; not some glossy idealised version of how we want them to be. Yes, Rob is all those things, but then so are men (humans, really) in general, and so am I on occasion!   (SPOILERS)   Not only do I identify with the main character, I recognise virtually all of the supporting characters as variants of someone I've met.  There isn't a false note sounded in this film (that one WAS intended!)  Particularly good is the scene where Laura asks Rob for sex after her father's funeral. It shows perfectly that sometimes we do things when they are not appropriate, and we can't explain them, but sometimes we just want them.   The team have done a brilliant job of adapting the novel by Nick Hornby. The film never seems too static that you get bored, but you always have the sense that it was drawn from a literary source.  Changing the setting from London to Chicago alters nothing.  People are people wherever on the earth you find them, geography doesn't matter.  If it's a good enough argument for Nick Hornby, it's good enough for me!   Cusack is superb as always in the role of the 'protagonist'.  Newcomer (at least to American cinema) Hjejle acquits herself well as the iconclastic Laura and Black & Louiso are also good as Rob's friends/colleagues.  There are also many cameo's; of which Tim Robbins' in particular is hilarious!  As with 'Grosse Pointe Blank', another Cusack labour of love, everything here seems put together perfectly.  The cast work well, the direction is top-notch, and the soundtrack is low-key but fantastic.  I urge anybody who has not yet seen this little gem of a film to check it out!  Feel free to e-mail or PM me if you watched based partly on my advice and were disappointed.  Everything about this film resonates for me, from the dialogue to the pathos of it all.  I have no idea what that says about me, but it's high praise indeed for the film! One for the jilted generation.",10,1,3,10 October 2001
Up in the Air," Spinning Plates...
","I don't see why we're supposed to think he's such a stunted guy for liking that lifestyle? (That's how the other characters see him, anyway. He tries to make connections and in the grand scheme of things, fails.) I mean sure, the firing is an unpleasant obligation that goes along with that existence, but you do the best you can. I hope there are no doctors out there who enjoy telling people they have cancer, but someone has to do it, and in both capacities, their task is to try to make the process as painless as possible.You're either a family person or a career person. You can't achieve top score at both, and all of his acquaintances choose to look down on him because he's not around more? That's *their* hangup, not his! It's a tough job trying to keep all the plates of life spinning, and he did the best he could.It's a snapshot into the transient lifestyle a la 'Lost in Translation', but this just worked better for me, because it's more pragmatic. Colour me heartless, I guess... :-/",10,1,5,18 February 2010
