The Sound of Music," One of my favourites
","I first saw this movie about 15 years ago and have loved it since. My favourite songs are 'The Sound Of Music', 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen', 'Do-Re-Mi' and 'Something Good'. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer were perfect as Maria and Captain Von Trapp. Eleanor Parker, Daniel Truhitte, Peggy Wood, Ben Wright and Richard Haydn were great supporting cast. This has to be one of Robert Wise's greatest films. I remember watching a documentary where Heather Menzies (Louisa), Charmian Carr (Liesl), Duane Chase (Kurt), Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich), Kym Karath (Gretl), Angela Cartwright (Brigitta) and Debbie Turner (Marta) returned to Austria 35 years after the film was released. The funniest scene in the movie was when Maria sat on the pine cone.",10,1,7,9 April 2007
The Jungle Book," Classic Disney
","When I first saw this in the re-released in the cinema in the 1990's I wasn't that keen on it but I when saw this again about 6 years ago I enjoyed it. My favourite songs were The Bear Necessities, I Wanna Be Like You, Trust In Me, Thats What Friends Are For and My Own Home. The special features on the 40th anniversary DVD were good. It was sad that Walt Disney and Verna Felton (who voiced one of the elephants) died the year before it was released and never got to see it on the big screen. This is my favourite Disney film, Lady and The Tramp was my favourite before. My favourite part was when the Elephants were singing Colonel Hathi's March.",10,2,4,10 February 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Great movie
","I bought this film recently on DVD and loved it. It's not my favourite movie of 2006 but I enjoyed the film. One of the reasons I bought the film was Alan Arkin (who I fancied in Wait Until Dark which was released years before Little Miss Sunshine) I thought Alan was great in the film and one of the best characters. I found Richard(Greg Kinnear) annoying. I was disappointed that the Grandad (Alan Arkin) died halfway through the film, the film was a bit duller when he died. It's great that Alan Arkin won the Best Supporting Actor at the Bafta's and the other awards the film has won. Not that I dislike this film but I don't think it's best film of 2006 I prefer Pirates Of The Caribbean Dead Mans Chest.",10,2,6,18 February 2007
Edward Scissorhands," Favourite Burton film
","This film is about a boy whose inventor (played by Vincent Price) gave him scissors for hands. I first saw this film when I became a fan of Johnny Depp three years ago. Johnny Depp is great in the role and he looked unrecognisable with all the makeup he had on. Winona Ryder did a good job of portraying the teenage daughter Kim Boggs. Diane Wiest and Alan Arkin were a good supporting cast as the husband and wife Bill and Peg. Peg reminded me of Renee Zellwegger, there voices are similar. When I first saw Wait Until Dark on telly I never realised Bill (the Dad played by Alan Arkin) was the villain who terrorises Audrey Hepburn. There were a few scenes that bugged me were when after Edward gets arrested why didn't Kim tell her parents or the police that Jim tricked Edward to breaking into his house.",10,1,1,2 September 2008
Psycho," My favourite Hitchcock film
","I recently bought this DVD on Ebay and thought it was a brilliant film. This is my favourite Alfred Hitchcock film. Psycho is one of my favourite movies of the 1960's along with Wait Until Dark, My Fair Lady, Mary Poppins, Two For The Road, The Sound Of Music, Breakfast At Tiffanys, Oliver, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, West Side Story. In my opinion I thought it was more a scarier film than the Audrey Hepburn film Wait Until Dark. Anthony Perkins was great as Norman Bates and I found him scarier than Alan Arkin in Wait Until Dark (not that Alan Arkin wasn't scary in Wait Until Dark). The music playing when Marion (Janet Leigh) got stabbed in the shower was freaky.I found the scene where the detective Arbagast (Martin Balsam) gets killed unexpected.",10,1,1,18 February 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Overrated
","I first saw this movie when I was about 7 or 8. When I was younger I never realised Miss Gulch was meant to be The Wicked Witch or Hunk (was that his name?), Hickory and Zeke were Tinman, Lion and Scarecrow. I think Over The Rainbow is a great song but I find it a bit gloomy. I've heard that Shirley Temple was considered for the role of Dorothy Gale, to be honest I can't really see Shirley playing Dorothy. I think it was out of order that Victor Fleming (director) slapped Judy Garland. I loved the dog Toto. I enjoy watching this but I have to say this is overrated compared to other Judy Garland movies (Easter Parade, The Harvey Girls, Meet Me In St Louis, etc)",9,2,10,28 March 2007
