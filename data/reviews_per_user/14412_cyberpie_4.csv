The Blair Witch Project," Much Ado About Nothing
","I caught this movie on DVD at home, and at night. I looked forward to having a good scare. However, all I can say is I ended up with a lousy headache and immense sense of Boredom, spelled with a capital B.Frankly, I have no clue what the hype surrounding the movie was about. What dominated the show were the conflicts among the 3 persons, accentuated by the fact that they were lost, and the stress induced by lack of food, rest and a good bath!Their conflicts became petty, self-centred and juvenile, which came out in the form of screaming sessions, sarcastic remarks and finger-pointing routine. They were just too distracting for me to enjoy the horror (if there were any in the first place).I can't call this a horror film. Maybe a showcase of young people in extreme duress coupled with psychological trauma. Or perhaps a teenage film telling what will happen to you if you hang out with pals whom you don't know well. I would say this movie is in the same category with films like 'I know what you did last summer' and 'scream', except that for this movie, the setting was in the woods.The jerkiness of a home-made video certainly didn't add to the pleasure of watching it.",2,0,1,3 November 1999
American Beauty," A bit draggy
","I went to see the movie not only because of the heaps of nominations it received and the buzz surrounding it. But I like such dramas with irony, parody and dark humor.The starting was good, and held my attention and laughter pretty well. I was disappointed however when the movie started focusing on the daughter and her relationship with the neighbour's only son. In my opinion, it was on the excessive side. On the other hand, Anette Bening's character was fun, full of sarcasm and totally a high point. It would have been better if the movie could elaborate why she was such a control freak and so concerned with career success when she has everything she needs in the material sense.For a while too, it also appeared to me that the focus was on the dysfunctional neighbour family rather than Lester's. Again, we do not know why the mother (neighbour family) seems mentally unwell. Does the movie assume that the audience understand? Or expects the blame to be on the husband? I could not figure that one out too well.My final query is: what came over Lester at the critical point? Why did he not indulge in fulfilling his fantasy?",6,0,0,6 March 2000
The Green Mile," I thought it was one of the those 3-hour movies ...
","Yet I found myself glued to the whole drama, not forgetting feeling terribly sad when John Coffee had to be executed. The only trouble I had was listening to what John was saying. The beginning portion reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, where the whole story was recounted as a past event. The difference is the impact of the past on the present was a little different in The Green Mile ... Enjoyed it, because the story is original with elements of a good human drama, humour and spirituality.",10,0,1,24 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," Worth watching
",One of the best movies that combines horror and human drama so well that it is almost seamless.The twist at the finale must count as one of the finest -- at least it had me hitting my head for not realising it earlier.Bruce Willis also establishes himself here as a actor.,10,0,0,3 November 1999
