Requiem for a Dream," Very Intense
","I had heard great things about this movie for maybe a few years now from many whom I know. I finally decided to get a copy of it as well as Pi, an earlier film by Darren Aronofksy.As the movie went on I became increasingly amazed at how Requiem for a Dream utilizes sounds, certain imagery, and many subtle effects that really elicit emotion from the viewer (me in this case). The cinematography was of a style that I hadn't witnessed before, but it was definitely great.The soundtrack is a simple yet powerful combination of techno beats with the Kronos quartet, and it's simply a great soundtrack. The songs are the types of songs that really bond to the emotion of the overall movie and continue to astound you if you listen to the soundtrack much later.Simply stated though, the movie was overall a great and painfully truthful movie. What begins as a harmonic situation and relationship among the characters turns to a symphony of discord that's filled with grief. And the way that it plays out is heartbreaking, for each characters' situation.Anyway, all in all I loved this movie but it definitely made me feel depressed. The way Darren created this movie and all the great acting can make anyone tied to the lives and emotions of the characters. Truly a heartwrencher.",10,2,4,14 February 2007
