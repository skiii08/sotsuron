The Ring," Not a bad remake but not near as good as the original.
","The Ring is an American remake of the Japanese 'classic' Ring  (no 'the') that was one of the highest box-office draws ever in that country when it was released in 1998. It was widely referred to as 'the Japanese Blair Witch' even though it had nothing to do content-wise with that film. This comparison was due to the deliberate 'novice' appearance of the film and it's surprising success with the movie-going populace.The film concerns a bootleg poor-quality video tape that is being circulated hand-to-hand amongst teenagers as a thrill game. The story goes that anyone who views the tape will die exactly seven days later. To give you ANY more of the plot would be an enormous disservice. This film is most potent when viewed without knowing any more than that.First off, let me state that the original version is FAR better than this remake. If you wish to see Ring and can get a hold of the region 3 import DVD and don't mind watching a film with subtitles, see the original. The original is not only better than the American remake but it is ten times as creepy and disturbing and fifty times as scary.That is not to say the American remake is a bad film. It's not. If I had not previously seen the original I would likely be raving over the American version. It has some clever plot rewrites that actually improve upon the original (and unfortunately a few deletions that equally detract from it). The cinematography is excellent and quite enthralling in it's 'non-Hollywood' presentation. The lack of opening credits and poor sound quality at the beginning are a masterful addition by the production team (you won't 'get it' until after you have seen the film). The film's antagonist is GREATLY watered down (no pun intended) from the original but still remains quite terrifying. I never will understand why Hollywood feels the need to 'tone down' foreign remakes for American releases. It really won't sell more tickets since more people would likely go see a scarier better movie.The actors and actresses are largely unknowns (with a few familiar faces) but they all turn in outstanding performances. Some of the non-traditional storytelling elements are truly inspired. Unfortunately I cannot reveal them without giving away parts of the story, but they are very well-done and very clever in the way they are presented.No blood. No nudity. No profanity. Just some very disturbing imagery and a truly scary story. I would not recommend this film for pre-teens, but anyone older will likely enjoy it (or at least be scared and somewhat disturbed). It's sad that this film is not getting more of a marketing push. Even though it's a remake, it's FAR better than any of Hollywood's recent pre-packaged aimed-at-teenagers supposed-to-be-scary efforts. It also is gambling on it's ability to attract audiences by word-of-mouth. Don't be fooled into believing that a poor box-office showing on opening weekend is any indication of a film's quality (go rent 'Zero Effect' for another good example).If you like horror films, this movie should be on your 'must-see' list. It's a fairly faithful re-make of the film that the recent Feardotcom plagiarized for most of it's ideas. This version of the film is a great treat for casual horror fans and  people looking for a good fright film who would never see the original under normal circumstances. True horror afficionados should really seek out the original. The Ring is a great film, but the original Ring (and to a great extent it's sequel, Ring 2) is a genre landmark and should not be missed by scary movie fans.",Null,0,0,3 October 2002
Spirited Away," A Fantastic Film (most literally)
","Good morning. Last night I was able to catch the Disney US Release of Spirited Away ( originally The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro). This is another  Disney purchase of a Japanese hit. For those that don't know, Disney has a nasty habit of importing titles from Japan and then changing the story when dubbing films or creatively editing the endings or plot to 'suit American audiences'. Personally I think that's a travesty. So  whenever you go see the Disney release of a foreign film, realize the film you are watching may not be the 'same film' the rest of the world sees.OK, that aside, was it a good film? I deliberately did no research before seeing this film as I prefer to go into films with little or no expectations. All I knew was that the film was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, the same man responsible for Princess Mononoke ( a film released a few years back that I also enjoyed). In the case of Spirited away, I'm glad I did not know what I was getting myself into, otherwise I might not have come (and surprisingly, not for the reasons you likely assume).The film concerns a young girl and her parents who find an odd tunnel in the side of a hill while moving to their new home. Upon investigating the tunnel, they find a strange 'theme park' on the other side devoid of inhabitants. Upon investigating the theme park, things are obviously very 'wrong' (at least to the little girl- her parents seem woefully oblivious) and as it gets closer to sunset, things just get worse. Unfortunately, this is all the plot I am able to reveal without spoiling the uniqueness of this film.This is an 'adult-oriented' movie. It has some rather disturbing images and ranks among the weirdest films I have seen in my life. It's a bizarre amalgam of Wizard of Oz,The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, My Friend Totoro, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The City of Lost Children (just to name a few). This film is interesting from beginning to end even though the plot advances rather slowly. There is always some new thing to see or some truly bizarre thing to witness. The animation is above average but not as impressive as Mononoke (and even features several gratuitous CGI sequences).There is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood 'comedy' in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No 'gratuitous' violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.This is not really a 'family film' (and definitely NOT a 'kiddee film') but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they'll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit 'weirded out' by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the 'kidney-buster' sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.If you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don't normally like 'cartoon movies', you might give this one a chance. It is not a 'casual moviegoer' film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you'll see this decade and you'll be sure to remember this film long after all the other 'disposable movies' have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn't even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film's release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves.",Null,178,273,4 October 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A fantastic sequel in all meanings of the word
","As with it's predecessor, this film is fantastic (in all meanings of the word). This is one of those rare films where a sequel meets or exceeds the film it succeeds.The cast (as with the last film) are truly outstanding in their roles. The casting director really deserves a LOT of the credit for the success of these films. Even the bit actors and actresses are exceptional. One sad note is that this will be the last Harry Potter Film with the current cast. Richard Harris (who played Albus Dumbledore) passed away recently, Chris Columbus (the director) has decided to withdraw from the series and the 'in crowd' buzz is that the trio of child-stars who starred in the first two films have reached puberty and will be too old to maintain the believability of the character ages for the third and remaining novels and will be replaced in the remaining films. If this is true, I would be reluctant to see the remaining films as I've become so enamored of the current cast and cannot imagine enjoying a 'Bewitched Darren moment' when cast members suddenly change without in-plot reason and the audience is asked to pretend it hasn't happened in a film series as good as this one has proven to be.The CGI is again outstanding. The effects vary from the utterly blatant (giant spiders, ghosts, magic, and a frightening basilisk) to the subtle (moving pictures on the wall, tattered owls, and a red-eyed cat) and convey just what they are supposed to without overwhelming one with the 'HEY! LOOK AT THIS!' presentation of most big budget special effects.This movie runs 2 hrs and 50 min. so don't drink the kidney-buster soda before the film begins. There is no nudity, and no conventional American profanity, but there are some pretty frightening scenes with the giant spiders and the basilisk and some creepy corridor scenes that might frighten younger viewers. It might be a good idea to leave the pre-schoolers home if they are easily scared or prone to nightmares.Overall, this film is a great sequel and should not be missed by fans of the first film. While seeing the first film is not absolutely necessary to enjoy the second, it does add a LOT of information that the second film takes for granted the audience is already familiar with. If you have not seen the first film, it would be well worth your time (and a lot of fun regardless) to watch the first film before going to see the second.Go see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It's as good or better than the original film and it picks up right where the last one left off in fun, quality and enjoyability.",Null,0,0,11 November 2002
