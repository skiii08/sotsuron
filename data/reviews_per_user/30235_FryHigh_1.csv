Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Great, fun flick!
","I've never had the pleasure of reading the book, so I went in without preconceptions.It was a fun flick, good story, great FX, and come on, it's Abe killing vampires! How can it suck??Can't believe some of the low reviews people are giving it because it's not true to the book. I wouldn't know, but for what it is, it was a ton of fun. My 8yo just loved it as well.Dinged 1 star because of an editing goof. I can see where it would make things confusing for some who didn't recognize it as such.Overall, definitely worth the price of admission.",9,3,6,1 July 2012
