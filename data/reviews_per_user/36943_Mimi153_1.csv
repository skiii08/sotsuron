Hereditary," worst
","This movie is boring. The action is all the same as in all the other films, nothing special or otherwise. There's nothing to be scared about. Voices are the same in any movie. Horror movies are getting worse. I do not understand why you make a horror movie that lasts for two hours, if it's just a bad movie that does not even scare you?",2,1,4,31 August 2018
