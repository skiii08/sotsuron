The Blair Witch Project," There's someone making a lot of money by giving me motion sickness.....
","The movie itself was fairly refreshing. There were no hooded creeps with hooks-for-hands trying to kill big-breasted highschool girls....However....The method of filming made me feel ill. It really did.  About 6 people left during the relatively short film to go yak up their popcorn, simply because it was hard to watch.
