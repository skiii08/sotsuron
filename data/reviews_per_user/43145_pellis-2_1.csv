Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I will see it again!
","Even though I have been jaded by all of the sci-fi special fx films over the last two decades, the Phantom Menace was still an absorbing escape from reality. Lucas is an excellent story teller and I can't wait to hear the rest. The sounds of children laughing and adults gasping make movies. The art of story telling is to draw emotion from the audience not put them to sleep like most of the movies that win academy awards. Sorry English Patient and Titanic. Smile, unwind and enjoy.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
