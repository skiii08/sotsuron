Requiem for a Dream," Visually stunning, virtually unwatchable
","I saw this movie after seeing it's high rating. I had expected it to be a difficault movie to watch, but some of the scenes are still in my head several weeks after watching it. Is that a good thing? I'm not so sure. I know that cinema should be challenging sometimes, but to the point of audience revulsion?If you have a strong stomach, and all the movies that are supposed to be shocking have proved to be an easy nights viewing, give this a go.
Otherwise, stick to Seven and Fight Club as they are just as stunning to watch but won't make you feel quesy for hours afterward !!!",5,0,1,19 February 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Big, dumb, and not much fun
","Dinosaurs.....explosions....Jeff Goldblum doing his mad scientist act, again....Julianne Moore proving that she really should avoid sequels....hardly any cool death scenes.....need I say more?",6,1,2,23 September 2002
Vanilla Sky," Better than the original - a first for Hollywood
","Saw the original, hated it. Like Cameron Crowe, thought I'd see what he did with it. Very stylish, fair too much music piped in every 5 minutes (bet they shifted a few copies of the soundtrack) but it was visually appealing. And Tom Cruise was funny, though whether or not that was deliberate is a discussion point for another website.See it, forget about it. Cameron says on the DVD that he is still talking about this film as it was so memorable. Er, no it isn't. I am still taking about 'Memento' but I'll have forgotten about 'Vanilla Sky' by next week.",7,0,0,29 October 2002
Signs," Best of the trilogy
","OK, so they aren't a trilogy, but they are released as a 3 disc DVD set in the UK!After his ghost story, and his superhero story, this is his take on an aliens story. In short, I enjoyed it and would recommend it. The build up of tension was superb, no film has made me jump this much since 'Ring' (the original, not the remake) and the pay off was satisfactory.Double thumbs up from me",8,0,1,9 June 2003
