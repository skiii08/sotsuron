Angels & Demons," Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.
","Where Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his knack for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit.With a cast of award winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight-forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's 'familiar' more-so than a necessary partner.The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (there have been quite a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how off-guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrap-up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady cover-up group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.",8,206,347,15 May 2009
Star Trek," The authentic casting makes this a must-see.
","If the main goal of Star Trek was to win over general audiences then I think they succeeded. With likable characters, top-notch special effects and a solid story, this nerd's epic hit the box office with the sonic boom from a roaring thruster. Zachary Quinto's Spock and Chris Pine's James T. Kirk are not only convincing but are near perfect in their matching to the original series. The characters are instantly recognizable by looks and accents and Eric Bana's Nero Romulan will drive fear into you and your planet.No doubt like all Sci-Fi remakes of our age, the die-hards will find something to diss on in the movie (I think these winners are called Trekkers). I mean it does miss the mark on delivering the stiff, robotic fighting and the flashing bulbs from the original series but for average Joe, this could easily be one of the best Space-Aged movies ever. Though the use of lens flare was a bit on the 'a little too much' scale, the feel of the Enterprise's bridge and the relationships among the crew came off as genuine and well acted. My only regret in seeing it was not experiencing it in full IMAX glory.The scenes that struck the best chord with me was aboard the Enterprise itself, though the Space and explosions were pretty, the bridge had a feeling of advanced technology and I liked the look of the Romulans. Simon Pegg's Scotty and Karl Urban's McCoy will no doubt be fan favorites and Zoe Saldana's Uhura will have the young men in the audience drooling. The full cast really grips you throughout the entire movie and it was enough to make me forget that Tyler Perry was in the movie.So J.J. Abrams has pulled it off, he has taken the most nerdiest of obsessive nerd shows and made it absolutely watchable to the regular person. Although the speedy plot will not win any awards, the character interaction, menacing bad guys and the authentic casting makes it a must-see.More reviews from Rafacus at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",9,3,8,10 May 2009
Public Enemies," It is an entertaining backseat ride into the life of a country boy turned bank robber
","With Billie Holiday singing her heart out and the subtle details of cracked nail polish and $3 dresses, Public Enemies brings you into the era of the Great Depression without boring you with back stories and explanations.It is an honest bio-pic with little factual variations outside of John Dillinger's romantic ambitions. It is an entertaining backseat ride into the life of a country boy turned bank robber in a time where America hated money-makers and banks. A time when people were starving and in need of a gun-toting, charismatic mid-western boy to stir things up a bit, one bank robbery at a time.A Cast of Winning Players Director Michael Mann is known best for Heat, Collateral and Miami Vice. His attention to detail is known and it is said that he went above the call of duty in his research for this movie. Obviously he deemed it important to depict a true version of the Dillinger story with a bit of Hollywood sprinkled in to keep our attention. Johnny Depp is solid as the charismatic bank robber, adopting his mannerisms, speech and swagger and even the trademark smirk that is seen on all of Dillinger's photos. Christian Bale is perfect as Melvin Purvis, looking similar to the 'G man' and confidently playing the role convincingly.Digital Camera and No true sense of good and Bad The camera threw me off a bit switching from an old sepia toned look to a digital one during fights. At times it made you feel as if you were an observant on the street while other times it felt just like a movie. I wasn't sure why this was but I concluded that Mann wanted us to be there with Dillinger most of the time and at other times we are to observe from a distance. There was no great love felt for any of the dark heroes, the charismatic Dillinger was likable but I never felt concern for his well-being. The FBI agent in Purvis (Christian Bale) was the typical white knight archetype and was given little personality outside of this so I felt nothing for him either. The romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) was interesting but felt clichéd (gangsters always have THAT chick in these movies) and just like real life that political blowhard J.Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) is the only real 'bad guy' in the entire film.Final Thoughts It felt like a different time period and the choreography of the gunfights were done well enough to keep me interested. With as colorful a crew as the boys who ran with John Dillinger, it would have been hard to direct a movie like this while keeping everyone relative. Men like Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) are given screen time, as well as Capone's number one do-boy Frank Nitti (Bill Camp). Still there was so much shown that you tend to lose your familiarity with Dillinger's quest for whatever it is he wanted and the hopelessness of his situation settles in after awhile. It is a good movie with no real emotional weight, just a 'this is what happened' gloss to the entire thing with a sprinkling of charisma to top it off. If anything, you will go researching Dillinger and gang after the movie has piqued your interest.www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",8,140,259,1 July 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," X-Men Origins: Wolverine spares no expense at blowing stuff up
","There's one thing that has always struck a good note with me about Hugh Jackman in movies the man seems to actually care about his performance. He seems to do his homework, assumes his role and bring across a genuine performance whenever he is working. It is this type of actor that can make a mediocre movie great. When Hugh is happy, you want to laugh with him, when he is ticked you feel the intensity. It is this type of acting that made the Wolverine such a likable character in this film.Bang-up special effects, blades slicing through inanimate and animate objects and enough fire and ice to make you feel as if you had just experienced Ragnarok. X-Men Origins: Wolverine spares no expense at blowing sh-t up. Shot from the angle of a gnat on the hairy back of Logan the Wolverine, we get to see why he is one ticked off dude and also why his bones are metal. Along with that, this movie shows a glimpse of how the Mutant School that Professor Xavier ran in the first three X-Men movies started.My favorite scenes from a cinematography standpoint depicts Wolverine and Sabretooth in all of our popular wars, Civil War, WWI, WWII, and Vietnam. These were shot beautifully and the look of it all felt genuine. My first paragraph may mislead you into believing that Jackman was the only top performer but you will be hard pressed to fine a Sabretooth more perfect than Liev Schreiber. Intense fighting scenes, very human emotions and supernatural powers are only sobered by the dull landscape that is the home of Wolverine during the movie. There were times I wished the big man would travel around the city a bit more just to liven up the background, it made me feel as if I was watching Legends of The Fall (great movie) with mutants in it. Fans will love the slick talking Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool sans red/black getup and also Taylor Kisch's Gambit who did some very Gambit things the brief time he was on camera.Of Course any more headliner mutants and this film would have fallen into the cluster f— that was the first three X-Men (X2 was awesome though) so it was kept at a minimum and all the portrayals were equally well done. Upon leaving the theater I listened to the comments of the comic book die-hards; What I got was that aside from the writers taking a few liberties with the characters well to be honest Deadpool (I liked him) they seemed genuinely pleased with the movie. For me that is enough to validate X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I mean it was solid, so check it out and make sure you sit through the credits. Oh ya and go see it on the big screen, even if you are one of the pirates who ganked the unfinished screener prior.More reviews from Rafacus at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",7,1,2,10 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Lacking in substance, relevance and ultimately reason
","I really, really wished someone else would have written this movie. There were a lot of things wrong with Terminator Salvation, but this is coming from a person who has watched the prior three installments and the television series. To the average young movie watcher who doesn't know the entire cast of characters in John Connor's story, this film will come off as a mediocre sci-fi action thriller with a confusingly weak story.Taking place after a Nuclear blast has wiped out much of the human race, John Connor (now a grizzled war vet) is one of the leaders of a revolutionary underground movement hell bent on taking back the earth from their machine masters. In the first two Terminator movies we are given a bit of history on this John Connor, how he loved people, how his selflessness and bravado was enough to make them forget their fears and fight back against the zerg. What I saw in Christian Bale's version of John Connor was a hardened loner-type, showing little to no emotion aside from the few times he was with his pregnant wife. This version did not feel like the leader we were made to believe led the revolution, he just lacked the sort of charisma that you would expect a guy like that to hold. He did not go through the ranks touching men on their shoulders and giving the fighters that reassuring eye to let them know he has their back the tiny hints that a viewer looks for to confirm their belief that this man was their saviour, just weren't there. No, John seemed cold, too cold, his decisions were not democratic, his beliefs are dashed aside at a whim and he seems to have no recollection of his youth (Terminaor 2: Judgement Day) when a machine taught him to think and not allow blind hate to cloud his judgement. This John Connor has a deep hate for the machines and it is reinforced by an ancient tape recorder that plays his mother's instructions from the past. This wrong John Connor ruined it movie for me because he is the protagonist, yet his story, visage, and history are so wrong that it was hard to look past him and like the movie.The story of Terminator Salvation felt like the piecing together of three different scripts being that it started out very well and ended up going nowhere fast. In the past movies we were led to believe that Skynet was so advanced and powerful, the only way out for the human race was to send someone back in the past to stop it from even starting. The Skynet we see in this movie is advanced at building cool machines and motorcycles (that lack any real AI). To recall Arnold's T-800 relentlessly doing detective work and searching for Sarah Connor in the first Terminator to seeing the T-600s in this movie (the obvious future of it all) walking blindly and being outsmarted by children, just didn't make sense whatsoever. Hell the explosions were pretty but I had absolutely no fear of the machine menace that ruled the world. This is not how I felt in the older movies. Remember how hopeless it seemed when the T-1000 chased the Connor family in T2, how it seemed nothing could stop it? It made you say to yourself, 'damn! How would you deal with 10 of those things if you can't even handle one in this movie!?' Well somehow McG and crew forgot this tiny element because the dumb machines and clueless T-600 models are laughably bad at tracking anything.Through all the horrible and forgettable writing that plagued this letdown, the best parts were the scenes with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Not so much the chemistry, but the fact that they had the least annoying scenes in the entire thing. The action scenes which had Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and John Connor (Christian Bale) seemed to be full of the most unrealistic coincidences to fall in their favor. The story behind Marcus Wright was probably the most interesting and would have benefited the movie if they delved into his past a bit more. The conflict in screen time between him and Connor did not flow well and it would have been better if they stayed with him and ditched Connor altogether.In closing I will say that Terminator Salvation was pretty but lacking in substance, relevance and ultimately reason. There is nothing to be learned from this one and it neither wraps up the saga nor adds anything to it. The story was a huge waste of time and a disappointment. Moon Bloodgood was deliciously hot though I will give it that but only that.",5,3,7,22 May 2009
Knowing," I turned and stared at my friends in disbelief
","When I finished watching Knowing, I turned and stared at my friends in disbelief at how ridiculous I found the ending to be.Starting out strongly, Knowing shows a father and son struggling with the loss of his mother as they carry on their daily lives. After an hour and a bit more, the main underlying plot of it all is revealed to be a loaded religious tale hidden in a nice shiny thriller coat. Complete with aliens er angels, it ended in a manner that warranted a walk-out due to absurdity.Amazing graphics and special effects seem wasted on this film that came off as a recruitment tool to get audience members into church bear with me. Mix in the DaVinci Code, the Passion and Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind and you have Knowing. I rolled my eyes so much at the story that I think I permanently damaged my right retina.Needless to say I cannot give much a review outside of Spoilers so I won't spend much more time on this. The heavily religious will love the doomsday, end-of-the-world theme of Knowing while the lightly religious and others will absolutely hate it. Stay far away from this one I hope Nic Cage finds better movies to act in soon.",5,2,4,10 May 2009
The Hurt Locker," One of the best war movies i've seen
","Beyond war movie and beyond another critically acclaimed movie, The Hurt Locker is the living definition of thriller. Rare is it that I find a movie that has me breathing unevenly whilst gripping my seat wondering what could happen next. The direction is simple but brilliant in it's own right, the acting is compelling and the reality of the so-called 'War on Terror' is very real. Director Kathryn Bigelow gets it when it comes to keeping the audience centered on the important things and I look forward to seeing more of her work in the future. Before writing the plot summary I must warn you that this movie is better enjoyed by going into it blindly. The less you know of what you will experience the more immersed you will be in the story. I will attempt to avoid spoilers and any real breakdown of what occurs within this wonderful movie but if you want to truly enjoy The Hurt Locker I urge you to skip my next paragraph within this review.Plot/Summary: The Hurt Locker is a situation set within the Middle East where American soldiers are forced to find and disarm bombs within the inner city. Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) have a little over a month before the next rotation frees them from their duty. Although the two men eagerly count down the days to escaping the dry and thankless desert, their comrade and leader in Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) sees things differently. Battle-hardened, with a hard-on for disarming bombs, James seems to laugh at death and his recklessness alienates him from his peers. However after a few outings the three comrades reach a level of understanding and James emerges as a leader that is much more than a cowboy looking for death.The most stand-out acting in this movie has to be that of the complicated Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). Not only is he believable but he forces you into his world of chaos, confusion, honor and love. Between he and Anthony Mackie's Sanborn you are made to feel sympathetic and remorseful to the plight that they are in. Although the movie seemed short, within seconds you are concerned for every single character. The bomb situations are limited but within every single one of them you are holding your breath in anticipation and fright. The cinematography did not look or feel staged and the eery music brings you right into the hopelessness of the jobs these men had to do. Written by Mark Boal, the script felt real, it felt as if it was 'a day in the life of', with pacing that was relevant and not contrived. There were no forced romances, friendships or atrocities to pull at your heart strings, the events are so seamless that it feels as if there was an invisible 'other' with a camcorder shooting the lives of real men.Sure you may need to look elsewhere if you are wanting another movie of 'guts or glory', Rambo-like, one man against the world warfare. But if you want something that feels real, looks real and warrants intelligent thought, you will want to see the Hurt Locker. An absolutely amazing movie.www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",10,17,31,14 July 2009
Clash of the Titans," Sorry but this 2010 version lacks character
","I do not know what is worse about this new Clash of Titans, the laziness in them not studying Greek mythology, or the laziness in keeping things relevant to the time period or mythos. Actually I know exactly what it is, it's the absolute waste of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, whose talents and characters was the only shining light in a dark movie of shallow characters, shoddy CGI and light speed pacing. It seems that people have forgotten the Greek mythology whose influence has made many a movie and tale as lovable as the original Clash of The Titans. Call me a nerd for being a tad too much into this but my annoyance started when the movie begins with a conveniently hacked up and incorrect story version of the Gods' win over the Titans to rule earth. I do understand the abstract nature of this movie and the reality that this particular Perseus (Sam Worthington) was not the one of the ancient poems. But something about the matter-of-fact nature of the narration rubbed me the wrong way. The armor and clothing is dark or black, there are no colors. The people or relevant armor that rang true of ancient Greece is not here. What we get instead is the X-Men treatment, black on everything and a mixture of armor and architecture of cultures that come about hundreds of years after the time of the Gods. Maybe Zeus wished in some steel from medieval Europe and haircuts from the modern day Armed Forces? He is all-powerful after-all, let's say he did, just so I can shut up about it.Aww screw it, I can't ignore these things! Seeing Zeus (Liam Neeson) walk away from his throne in a type of mock plate mail armor, reminded me of his role as Gawain in Excalibur. Why was he dressed like a medieval knight in a movie about ancient Greece I wondered? This is not to say that the other Gods were much better off either, Apollo in golden standard was also in a form of scale mail and so was Poseidon (Danny Huston) who is replaced in relevance with the new owner of the Kraken, Hades (Ralph Fiennes). How does this make sense that an obvious water creature is owned by the king of the Underworld? Who cares right!? Perseus, again in ancient Greece sporting a buzz cut reminiscent of a Marine or a Roman Legionnaire was only second in lack of relevance to him actually being played by Sam Worthington. Sorry folks, Jake Sully did not show up to play this time. Gone is the likable kid from the original who grows in front of our eyes from a boy gifted by the gods to champion them, into a man who is bold and clever enough to take on the gorgon Medusa and topple the champion of Poseidon. No we get a Perseus who is simply not in the right time period, mindset or character to either be believable or formidable. When Io (Gemma Arterton) basically takes his hand and teaches him how to kill Medusa (Natalia Vodionova) it summed his character up very well. This is not the brave Perseus of the original, not by a long shot.Ralph Fiennes as the bent and ultra dark Hades was a great character, his low, gritty voice and dramatic entrances made him extremely scary. The satyr-like Calibos (Jason Fleming) who chased Perseus and made his life hell in the original is reinvented in this as a jilted lover, whose body has been turned into some sort of demon, albeit not a satyr. Io is the replacement for the lovely goddess Athena, whose wit and metallic owl of the original were mainstays in our memory of its charm. Io is beautiful but she is no Athena, and thanks to the pacing which made this 2 hour movie seem like 30 minutes, you get no true feeling of familiarity with her or the other beauty in the movie, the princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos).I really wanted Clash of The Titans to be great, and based on the high votes I see on the web, it's apparent that super fast pacing and lack of character development is positive right now. Maybe I am too old school and like to learn the personalities, histories etc. of my heroes but what can I say? For me the inaccuracies, pacing and shallow nature of this 2010 Clash of The Titans makes for a bad movie – which by the way is another to take full advantage of the 3D fad going on since Avatar. This makes me wonder about Sam Worthington and his range, or lack thereof, and why Liam Neeson thought that it was a good movie to be a part of. The trailers had me salivating, especially at the Kraken, yet upon seeing it at the end, I was already done with the movie.Of all the characters and wasted talent, I must say that chief soldier Draco (Mads Mikkelsen) was my favorite. His portrayal of a grizzled, old wartime soldier was well done. Despite the pacing issues, we got enough of his character and history to go from hating him to respecting, then finally liking him. If you own the original Clash of The Titans and you bemoan the campy, cheesy humor or the extremely dated special effects. You will find yourself forgetting its faults in lieu of its character; because for all the 3D effects, expensive CGI and acting talent, this 2010 version lacks character and I am sorry but no amount of 3D debris flying in my face can make that a good movie for me.

The Wrestler," The Wrestler in essence is a tragedy, being that it is so absolutely real
","The Wrestler is the type of film that makes movies the special part of life that they are. The ability of an actor, script, music and cinematography to pull at our emotional strings and force us to feel remorse or happiness for a fictional character is amazing. It is amazing but unfortunately a rarity in the hundreds of movies pumped out every year, but once in awhile you stumble on a gem, and that gem renews your faith not only in the industry but in the art of story telling.It is the clichéd tale of the mighty warrior falling from glory. The gladiator who has grown old and tired, too damaged to please the adoring crowd and too alien to the normality of life to do anything else. It is the story we are shown quite often but rarely do we get the reality of such a situation. It makes you wonder why boxers way past their primes come back to the ring and NFL players who are past effectiveness refusing to retire. It is something foreign to the everyday man who has not endured the bumps and bruises of a life of pain in entertainment to please the adoring crowd. The Wrestler is such a tale, allowing us for a few moments to see the candid truths of a professional wrestler in the twilight years of his career.Having known some wrestlers in my time period, I already knew this tale. Well documented by scenes in documentaries such as Beyond The Mat, I know that an older wrestler is normally broke, heavily reliant on drugs and damn near suicidal. With the exception of Hulk Hogan and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, you will be hard pressed to find retired wrestlers who are living comfortably through the fruits of their labor. The Wrestler allows us to be a fly on the wall in the life of one of the unlucky old-timers.Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a professional wrestler with a long career of success behind him. With the old aches and age finally dragging him down, Randy is unable to keep up with life outside the ring and spends nights sleeping in his van. His hopes of returning to stardom leads him to doing small independent shows for little to no money until he is hit with a severe health issue. In a vain attempt to retire and live normal life, Randy pursues a relationship with Cassidy/Pam (Marisa Tomei) a dancer at the Strip Club he frequents and his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Unfortunately regular life and Randy do not mix well and he is forced to fall back on the only people who have always been there for him the crowd.The Wrestler in essence is a tragedy, being that it is so absolutely real it feels more documentary than motion picture. Mickey Rourke is perfect and so believable that had he not been a famous actor it would be hard pressed for you to convince me that 'The Ram' wasn't a real person. Not only is Marisa Tomei absolutely beautiful in this film but she brings a real humanity to Cassidy that ran parallels to some of the working girls I know in life. The movie was powerfully realistic and relevant and I think it will bring some much needed attention to the entertainment/sport of pro wrestling. To top it off the score is so melancholy and appropriate that it plays with your emotions as much as the action on screen.This is not a rental folks, this is a purchase and treasured film for your collection. I am very glad to have seen it and with the low budget used to film it shows that a tough story and an actor that can pull it off is all that is needed for cinema gold.Moe reviews from Rafacus at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",10,2,4,10 May 2009
The Proposal," Taming of The Shrew with a Green Card twist.
","A modern-day 'Taming of The Shrew' with a Green Card twist. Reynolds was himself, Bullock was sexy and Betty White stole the show.Without pretense of being something other than a predictable romance comedy, The Proposal did not surprise, disappoint or lend itself to any other emotions outside of my cringing at the 'awwwwws' that the female audience members would coo whenever people kissed, spooned or proposed on screen. Not being the biggest fan of this genre of movies, I went into it with little expectations outside of seeing the hotness that is Sandra Bullock, only to leave feeling rather unimpressed.I found Sandra Bullock's portrayal of the Icey Margaret to be pretty good, being that I began to hate her, I would say she did a helluva job. Margaret, is a head case, never have I seen a woman this cold on film since Tilda Swinton's portrayal of The White Witch in the Chronicles of Narnia. She is also a peculiar woman, going from office ice queen to singing Rob Base's 'It Takes Two' and shaking her ass to the Ying Yang Twins I couldn't make this up if I wanted to. I was not sure what to think of Margaret outside of her physical goodness, the character was not likable even after her taming was done.Ryan Reynolds was harmless, and his character was written to be more of a prop than a person. Although his wit and timing are always solid, I can barely remember any of his lines outside of him looking confused and dazed the entire time. The parents are typical but Grandma Annie (Betty White) is who owns this movie. Claiming Native American blood, she does fire dances (yes I know), loves lap dances and is very candid with her opinions. She is pretty much that strange, quirky senior that some of us have experienced in our lifetimes.The formula as I've said is standard RomCom fluff. There is an attempt of a side story dealing with the tensions of Andrew's super successful father Joe Paxton (Craig T. Nelson) and his son but it felt so uninspired and pointless that I wished they had just left it out. This is definitely not something to run out and tell your friends to see. I would take it as a nice, edible RomCom that guys can watch with their ladies without the need for coffee to keep them awake. Would I recommend seeing this in the theater? Probably not, but it isn't exactly bad either, just a strangely mediocre movie that cannot figure out what it is, or what it is trying to do.Review taken from www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",7,0,3,14 July 2009
The Soloist," The Soloist was beautiful but not for everyone
","Detailing the life of Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a schizophrenic, musical genius who lives on the street. The Soloist seemed to be a movie that tries to teach tolerance and understanding when it comes to the mentally disabled and the homeless. It may be touted as a long boring movie, but that is not to say it wasn't a beautiful story with an outstanding score. The older viewer who appreciates when a film or story has a moral to it will really appreciate this while the young popcorn munching, red laser flashing, movie watcher will fall asleep.Plot (Skip if you hate Spoilers) Steve Lopez (Robert Downey JR.) is a well know journalist for the New York Times who is struggling due to the decrease in readership (a point which is blamed on the internet through dialogue and hinting) so he must find a good story and find it fast. One day whilst taking a lunch break he comes upon a homeless man playing a violin with only 2 strings. Curiously approaching the man and talking with him, Lopez learns that the man was a former student at the Julliard school and this prompts him to start a story on the musicians fall from grace.The Soloist takes us into the lives of two very different men; One has a passion but lives with a lifelong obstacle of mental illness. The other is a man who has much going for him but struggles with commitment and loyalty. In essence these two souls find each other and unbeknownst to each other, help one another just by the influence of life.My only gripe with the movie was the pacing because it did not offer much for excitement... for a film that honors Ludwig Van Beethoven as highly as this one, I did not experience any form of high crescendo but rather a lull cadence that will only work for the truly interested. It is a good watch for the parents who will no doubt leave saying 'that was so beautiful' while dabbing away tears. For movie homers like myself I expected Robert Downey Jr. ad Jamie Foxx to deliver acting unparalleled and I was not disappointed. However no matter how fine the acting, this isn't something I could sit through a second time. Informative... yes, but not entertaining.",8,1,3,25 April 2009
