The New World," Beautifully filmed but terribly flawed....
","Probably one of the most irritating film scores I have ever heard. One chord continuous(almost sounded like looping) on and on...like sitting at railroad crossing waiting on the train to pass while your hearing the monotonous rhythm of the train.The acting was passable, but the dialog was sometimes untenable, as most of it was the thoughts of the characters and not actually spoken. Direction and scene cuts were disjointed, and the viewer is easily confused. There are a few scenes where there is a tight shot on the character, the viewer thinks that by this expressive shot they will gain a little more insight on the characters emotions, then BAM! cut to black! If this is film art by the best, let me see some amateur stuff. The story just doesn't flow. Terrible waste on a good story.",10,2,6,6 June 2006
Dreamgirls," Overrated, Over-hyped, Overplayed
","A disappointment. Needed to stay on Broadway where it belongs.The movie- consuming public was mislead as to the true concept of this film.A lot of oldies fans expected a biopic 'loosely based' on the Supremes (thanks to the pre-release hype). This film was disappointing to that group, and having said that, those who did watch it were treated to a slow-moving, smarmy musical with less than inspired song writing. The performances were passable, but overplayed. Eddie Murphy was believable in his role, but here he is back doing James Brown from SNL. The rest of the cast doesn't merit my mentioning them here.I purchased the DVD without preview, and I'm glad the store buys back used movies. This one's making the trip.",3,0,2,6 May 2007
