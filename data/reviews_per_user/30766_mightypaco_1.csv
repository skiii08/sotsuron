Skyfall," Didn't like it the first or second time
","*Spoilers*Seriously, I don't get it. The person I first saw this movie with and two other people at work defend this movie as a good movie and like it. I saw it in the theater and later on TV, wondering if I was in an odd mood when I saw it the first time. I wasn't. Here's what I didn't like about it both times I saw it.1) First scene, Bond gets accidentally shot in the gut and fall off a train in the water. We have no idea how he survived, but then he appears alive later and in fairly good condition. Can we at least have some insight into his superhuman abilities? It just strikes me as unrealistic and a gap in reasonableness.2) Next, the old menopausal bat that Bond takes orders from is entirely unapologetic that she gave the order for a different agent to shoot and accidentally kill Bond. She is not sorry for it, makes no apologies to Bond, etc. and does not even seem to care that he is alive or greet him in a friendly manner. She seems cold and almost upset with him and shows him zero warmness. She is a bulldog-faced old bag that I do not like or have any sympathy for. I find her to be butchy and annoying, yet in the latter half of the movie, all Bond does is try to save her. She doesn't deserve any saving! I can barely look at her face without hating her the whole movie. The movie basically says Bond is loyal to someone and an organization who couldn't care less if he is dead or alive and doesn't treat him well. I don't get it.3) Towards the end of the movie, Bond falls through a frozen lake and fights with someone underwater for a long time. Then appears inside moments later to save the day, hardly wet and not cold at all or shivering with hypothermia. He just has a contented grin on his face, which strikes me as very unrealistic and stupid.4) The old man in the house during the shoot out is supposed to be some bad ass, and I'm supposed to care. I don't. He's an old unimpressive man, and I just don't care. Also, if memory serves me, there are too many gun shots fired w/o reloading during the big bang up shoot out.5) Bad guy spy removes his teeth and is transformed into some nasty looking face. It's just odd and feels unrealistic to me.6) Much of the movie is dark and towards the end is a bunch of clich√© explosions and shoot outs. It's just not terribly interesting and the plot just seems off and silly, not to mention the fact that Bond is saving the ass of an old unapologetic, unattractive woman, who should have retired years ago.This is my first IMDb review, and that's just how I feel about the movie. It didn't strike a good chord with me, obviously, but I generally do like Daniel Craig.",3,11,22,30 October 2014
