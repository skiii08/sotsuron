Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious!
","I was privileged to receive a ticket to see an early pre-screening of this film and let me just say that I wasn't disappointed! Usually, for a film with a lot of hype, you'd expect that the movie will be terrible and only the scenes from the trailer are good, but this was not! I was thoroughly impressed at the way that Sacha Baron Cohen is able to use his character to pick out the foibles of everyday Americans and reveal our inner stereotypes that many harbour for others. Some scenes were pretty disturbing to say the least (Like a nude fight between Borat and his director), but it simply added to the humour of the movie. I highly recommend this film, but only if you're not planning on being overly critical about certain creeds and races.",10,4,20,1 November 2006
Casino Royale," It's Bond as a human, isn't that amazing!
","I saw Casino Royale on opening night and even though it was missing Moneypenny and Q, the characters we have come to know and love, I have to say that it was a good movie. We see 007 receive the 007, and he gets busy on his mission. This is a younger version of James Bond, and he is a character that we can all relate to, he's not a suave and smooth agent who enjoys his vodka martinis shaken, not stirred. He's Bond, as a human! He makes mistakes, he runs through walls, he trips and falls, he creates havoc when there shouldn't be havoc. This is a character that we can all relate to! I recommend seeing this film when you get a chance and also, stop wailing on Daniel Craig, he's not THAT blonde!",8,0,2,3 December 2006
