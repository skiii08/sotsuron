Requiem for a Dream," Visceral
","Hubert Selby Jnr as in Last Exit manages to produce the most gut wrenching, Jesus let that never happen to me stories. He made himself ill several times portraying his characters so buckle in as things are about to get progressively worse for all our protagonists. Not a feel good movie by any means more of a there but for the grace of God go any one of us who for various reasons have fallen on hard times.",8,2,2,18 March 2020
