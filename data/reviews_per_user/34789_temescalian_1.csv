Kill Bill: Vol. 2," unique and entertaining
","That quirky Tarantino.  Like his other films, he really puts his eccentricity into this.  In this movie he demonstrates his mastery of manipulation and direction.  One minute I'm laughing, the next I'm sad, then angry, then laughing again.   Sometimes I experienced more than one emotion at a given time.  The story telling is overt and purposefully over the top, playing off of cliches from older genres of film, particularly that of martial arts.I watched vol.1 with my Happa roommate and he confirmed that the action sequences were very reminiscent of the old samurai movies he used to watch, and with lovably hilarious Master Pai Mei in vol.2, there was no doubt of QT's references--no, his enthusiasm for old chinese kung fu films.  In retrospect it makes you think, 'I just watched a samurai duel take place inside of a cramped trailer in the middle of the desert and I accepted every moment of it--to say the least.' Tarantino infuses and integrates the kind of elements that one would otherwise find incredulous; so seamlessly and with such unique prose.  The type of attitude you see in his character interactions makes you chuckle, even amidst the gravity of the situation if you stop to think about it.The second movie is what some would consider slower than the first. Still, I found even the heartless antagonists to have their own sense of charm--adding to the mixed sensations I was speaking of.  Personally, I hardly missed the mindlessly excessive gore found in Vol.1
For me, it was a unique, over-the-top, and utterly entertaining film. Very intentional and well composed.  I would recommend both volumes of Kill Bill UNLESS you are squeamish about blood or are completely unable to comprehend any cultural satire presented before you.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
