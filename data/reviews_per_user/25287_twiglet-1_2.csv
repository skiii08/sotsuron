Come and See," not as advertised
","I thought the movie was average at best!  If you like artsy films, you might like this.  There were some very good scenes that were enjoyable to watch, and made it somewhat interesting to watch.  But, it had about 2 hours of boring scenes that were not that eventful.  I don't want to think how it felt or have some weird imagery, I wanted to see more actual fighting, and how the war was perceived by soldiers not a 12 year old boy  The movie was not cohesive at all it reminded my of a Thin Red Line, if you like that movie you would like this.  I would imagine most war movie fans would not like this movie.   Save your money and pass this one up!!",3,11,84,28 November 2001
Paths of Glory," AVERAGE AT BEST
","I heard from a few people that this was a good movie.  Then I saw it, and I was very dissapointed.  I thought the acting was very average at best.  It seemed they were all over acting!  The plot was simple, very easy to follow. If you are looking for a good WAR movie, don't look here.  There are alot of movies out here that are a whole bunch better than this.  It got to the point, in the movie where I am thinking this has got to get better than this, but it doesn't.  I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. I would give it a 4 out of 10.",3,9,45,10 August 2002
