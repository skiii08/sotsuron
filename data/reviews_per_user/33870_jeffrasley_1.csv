Stop-Loss," Important message
","Stop Loss has an important message for those disconnected from the US military: our servicemen are being asked to do more combat tours than ever before in the history of the US military. Since the end of the Draft after the Viet Nam War all combat operations are carried out by the limited number of volunteer GIs. Okay, they volunteered, but with the numbers in the Army, National Guard, Reserves, and Marines, they are being asked to do too much time in combat; hence the massive numbers suffering from PTSD, ballooning suicide numbers, spousal abuse, and other problems experienced by and caused by returning servicemen.Stop the senseless wars that should not be fought and are not worth the sacrifice of our young volunteers or our nation's resources. And, bring back the Draft so the whole nation feels the pain when we go to war. Stop Loss makes this case.",9,1,1,4 January 2014
