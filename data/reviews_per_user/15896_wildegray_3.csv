Ali," A good, but not totally satisfying film.
","'Ali' is a powerful docudrama, with some major flaws.  Though the performances are uniformly excellent (particularly Will Smith in the title role), the film does not have a third act.  It simply ends, not bothering to tie up the many plot strands it presents.  Additionally, there is a lot of material that feels impertinent to the film, not the least of which is the extra-marital affair Ali engages in during the 'Rumble in the Jungle' sequence.  I actually feel that 'When We Were Kings,' the documentary about Ali, was a more successful piece because it was limited to the coverage of the 'Rumble in the Jungle.'  'Ali' feels at times that its reach exceeds its grasp, and at others like it doesn't even try to reach very far. Frustrating, because there are so many good moments in the film and yet they fail to add up to anything remotely as powerful as the impact that Muhammad Ali has had and continues to have on our world.",7,0,0,27 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," There's never a dull moment in this riveting adaptation.
","Many film critics seem to be hitting some of the same points in their reviews:  The film is too faithful to the book; the film is too long; the director didn't take enough risks; there's 'something missing' here. Generally, I do agree that the film had one too many set pieces, but I disagree that the film was too faithful to its source.  I think nearly all the scenes in 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' were necessary to tell the whole story, something most Hollywood movies have a hard time doing these days.  Isn't it refreshing to see a film where each scene actually flows logically into the next?The one scene I had a tough time warming up to was the 'Troll' sequence.  I thought it was an unbelievable contrivance in the book, and it was even worse in the film.  Of course, at scene's end, the audience needs to see a glimpse of Professor Snape's bloodied leg so as to heighten suspense, but this moment could have been combined with a different scene to make the story more efficient.  Other than that, I thought many of the book's subplots were appropriately condensed or excised.
In some ways, the film improves upon the novel.  Steven Kloves' script wisely sidesteps the inane commentary of Lee Jordan during the Quidditch match.  And I felt that the result of the showdown between Potter and Voldemort was more satisfying in the film than in the novel.  Of course, with all the trimming and cutting, it's unfortunate that certain great quips and exchanges between characters are given the axe, but I must say that the filmmakers have created a compelling drama which, for the most part, captures the essence of Rowlings' popular book.Overall, Chris Columbus' direction is solid, if not particularly brilliant.  Columbus has often exhibited solid crafstmanship over the years, and here, his skill lies in bringing the story to the audience in a straight-forward, but engaging way.The acting is quite strong.  Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry as the cool, calm center of the film.  Rupert Grint displays expert comic timing as the underpriveleged, but spirited Ron Weasley.  nd Emma Watson captures perfectly the precociousness of Hermione Granger.  Of the adults, all are stellar, with Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltraine standouts as the sinister Professor Severus Snape and giant groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, respectively.Regarding the score, John Williams occasionally overwhelms the action with obvious emotional payoffs.  But his score also creates gentle lyrical moments, as when Potter sits and stares out the window at the moonlit lake during his very first night at Hogwarts.One wonders how the Academy will warm up to the picture.  It certainly has an epic quality and seems to possess all the elements of a classic film. I predict that it will receive nominations for Costume, Makeup, Visual Effects, Sound, and Editing, but not Best Picture.  However, with such paltry offerings at the multi-plexes this year, who knows what could happen?",10,0,0,28 November 2001
Shrek," Shrek was very overrated.
","How could so many of the nation's critics be hoodwinked by 'Shrek' and not see it for what it really was - a dumbed down, tiresome and thematically inconsistent bore.  First of all, this film panders to the lowest common denominator with the usage of a 'hip' pop soundtrack and stereotyped characters.  I'm referring specifically to Eddie Murphy's step-and-fetch-it donkey role, the viewing of which should have caused riots at the NAACP, but didn't.  It is the most hideously and offensively stereotyped character in recent memory.  Furthermore, this film was dull and lifeless.  It relied so much on reference after reference to Disney films that I came to wonder when the references would cease and when the actual movie was going to begin. And because film critics routinely turn off their brains during animated films, they didn't notice the glaring thematic contradiction in 'Shrek.' The overall message of the film is that appearance doesn't matter, and yet the filmmakers have no qualms with making fun of the small stature of the Prince character.  I was really disappointed with 'Shrek' - so much so that I actually fell asleep while watching it.",2,7,14,28 December 2001
