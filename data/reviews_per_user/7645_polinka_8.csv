The Avengers," 8.6? What for?
","I like super hero movies; if well made they are lots of fun. If they are done by a Master-they are very good (The Latest Batman, the first X-men,the 1st Spider Man). I watched all of the characters in this movie in their previous solo's: enjoyed Iron Man the most (Robert Downy Jr. is one of the best actors ever); thought that Thor was very entertaining and funny (and definitely a pleasure to look at...);I enjoyed the last Hulk with E.Norton, and watched Cpt.America @ home (saved on the ticket...)and thought it was OK.We went to watch it after seeing the rating. SO: This movie is entertaining, if you like lots of CGIs and action; there is NO Original/Surprising story. The acting is good (they brought GOOD Actors, you wouldn't expect less). We laughed twice (The Hulk character provided the much needed relief). You will enjoy it on a big screen. BUT THAT'S IT. 8.6? Really? How many times you can watch Manhattan destroyed?! Time and time again in every other CGI movie.Grow up and get more original.(And Yes,AVATAR was better). I gave it a 5 to lower the expectations of people who go to watch a movie on the big screen,instead of watching it @ home.If you like CGIs and a predicted plot it deserves between 6-7. If you expect a masterpiece like THE DARK KNIGHT,-this is NOT. It's not even IRON MAN the 1st. It was very disappointing.",6,5,15,13 June 2012
3:10 to Yuma," It was a good movie
","I liked the storyline and the suspense, even if some of the developments did not look believable,- like Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) being fit to ride almost immediately after the surgery; the same with Ben Wade(Russel Crowe) after the torture scene; than, the fact that he decided to support Dan Evans (Christian Bale's character)to the end (he was not 'all bad', but it is a far cry from shooting all his gang)-, Well,It is just a movie... Anyway, the acting is very good - that's what actually saves the movie and makes it to stand out. Russell Crowe does a superb job - as always -, Christian Bale proves again that he is a very talented, versatile actor, and Ben Foster - as Charlie- is great. (not surprising for people who watched this actor in other performances.)Peter Fonda is a delight to watch and Logan Lerman is a good looking promise. Definitely a recommended movie for movie lovers, not only as a western, well worth your time.",8,2,6,9 September 2007
It," Another pointless horror movie.
","The only reason I gave it 4 stars is ,well, the clown (and maybe, maybe the Girl.) His 5 minutes at the beginning and here and there in the movie,-his acting was good.The story...well I got it that there is A STORY with more developed and interesting characters(didn't read the book, sorry) about friendship, and abuse, and fear and murder.But the movie missed all that and some of the characters were just annoying. Hated the CG. Didn't scare me (but I'm never scared at horror movies), just provoked the thought that it could be a much better movie without the gore and childish 'pranks'. I watched it just to know what the noise and the no.1 in the box office was all about; got to the end, congratulating myself that I didn't spend any money on it,- and maybe I will read the book.Here is a positive point!",4,0,1,13 December 2017
The Devil Wears Prada," great acting but the plot....
","the movie is entertaining,the actors are doing a great job,but the story line is not really believable and very predictable.some of the things don't work: such as referring to the main character -Anne Hathaway- as 'fat',when you see in front of you a slim person; than, her reaction to an opportunity from a famous magazine(giving it up to go to her boyfriend), when on the other hand, she neglects him all the time to slave for something she 'knows' is not her true call. Even in a comedy, some things should follow through.it is a fun,light movie, perfect for video rental,-because of the acting and the great outfits... otherwise it would have been just another romantic comedy.",7,0,0,14 December 2006
I Am Legend," Will Smith and the dog save that movie from a complete flop
","It so happened that we watched this movie a day after we watched '30 Days of Night' and we couldn't get over the feeling that the same vampires were 'borrowed' from the other movie to this one... Even if in this movie the plot is a more intelligent one (thanks to the book?), and the pictures of empty New York are very impressive,-it felt hollow, it left us with the feeling of 'been there before, seen it already'. It is supposed to make you wary of the future and so on,but the script and the story itself did not work; and since our son (17)watched the movie with us, and he was not impressed either, so it doesn't seem to work for a yonger audience as well. The 'anti-humans' look like a bad video game villains, (even in 30 days of night they were more realisticaly looking)and the explanation of the disease/virus was very poor or absent.(that goes beyond saying that the whole thing is ridiculous).I gave it a 6 out of 10 since the movie is still worth watching: because of some of the effects, because of Will Smith (and the Dog), and the comic reliefs,- we like 'Shreck' and Bob Marley too... as to the end of humanity? it will come, naturally, but in the meantime we should look for better movies...",6,1,2,9 March 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," the only reason I write this comment: I am unable to see my vote for the past 3 weeks!
","My opinion is that this is an excellent movie, because it is so different: in it's story line, in it's concept and in making you think. It doesn't follow the regular predictable chronological outcome.you cannot anticipate how BB will react in every event that accrues in his life: according to his physical or mental abilities, and what are those at this point? The love story is beautiful, in it's way that you need to fill blanks by yourself. It is told for you to interpret, anyway you want. the acting is very good especially by Brad Pitt and Taraji P.Henson (I found Cate Blanchett - whom I admire- too bombastic here). The movie was purely enchanting and beautiful,- in my eyes;the humor was great; and I was surprised that the movie is actually long. I thought,afterwords, about the fact that our life just passes so fast, and it leaves you at the end - if you die 'naturally' from old age-helpless as an... ugly baby. Benjamin Button was born as a monstrous baby, abandoned by his grieving father, but he died as a gorgeous baby in the arms of the woman he loved, who during his life was his friend; his lover; his mother. So, was he lucky? It depends on how you accept life...",10,1,2,7 February 2009
August Rush," loved the movie despite the flows
","First of all, it is a fairytale, not a real dramatic story; something for Christmas, that adults -romantic ans sensitive ones, who enjoy music,- will have a good time with. the cast is beautiful, the music is a joy and there is the nice story about a boy looking for his parents through music. Even though the story is supposed to be sad and heart wrenching - it is not. Robin Williams is not 'Feygin',and the young protégé is not 'Oliver Twist'. that's one of the reasons that you feel a bit remote and not involved in the story.(actually I felt bad for the boy who played Arthur, and was the favoured before 'August Rush'). The part with the forged signature was completely unbelievable (we are talking 1995 here!), but - as I said, it is a fairytale about people in love, loving music, bringing to the world a wonderful child who makes them proud the moment they lay their eyes on him...are they not a bit like you and me, or who we would love to be?...",9,1,3,9 December 2007
Hancock," took me by surprise
","I was ready for silly jokes and bad CGI; I was sure that (according to the critics)it will be a waste of about 2 hours...BUT IT WAS FUN! First of all, don't take the movie seriously (you were supposed to take seriously 'I am legend' and it was a disappointment for me). I liked the fact that there is no big villain character in the movie and no epic battle between the good and the bad (thank you, writer/director/producer!,that's what ruined it for me in 'Iron Man'). It was funny and kind of realistic where it concerned media and public reaction. I liked Charlize Theron character, and the scenes between them were good. I found the explanation about their destiny/love story, whatever you call it, stretched,- but at least trying to be different.I found it charming that they are attracted to each other again and again, but when they are together it neutralizes their powers. Maybe we enjoyed it because we did not expect much and were entertained, it was a more fun super hero (charming Will Smith), and aside from the last scenes in the hospital, kept the good spirit including the final Moon Ad. It made us feel good (my family of adults), instead of the uneasy feeling we have after watching all the other super hero's, including good movies like 'the dark night' and 'iron man' and the last 'hulk'. The uneasy feeling is because this comic characters are taken too seriously - more and more so- and people relate to them in a real way. I thought it is a good thing to put it back into purely imaginary product, showing the flows of such imaginary hero and the possible outcome of his imaginary deeds.",8,1,2,11 September 2008
