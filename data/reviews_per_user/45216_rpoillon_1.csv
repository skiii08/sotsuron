Walk the Line," Definitely Worth Seeing
","Hats off to Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, and Waylon Payne for excellent performances. Their performances alone make this a 'must see' bio pic, whether you're a Cash fan or not. The only negative to the movie was that the plot dragged at points, i.e., too much time was spent on the 'down years' and not enough on the 'up years.' There are points in the movie ('down years') where I was thinking, 'I get the picture...enough already!' Would have been a better movie if it emphasized Cash's later, successful years. For example, more time could have been spent on the Fulsom Prison scene, which was excellent. By not doing so, the director misses an opportunity to further showcase the excellent job Phoenix and Witherspoon do with the music.Even with this negative, this movie is definitely worth the time and money, and should be seen on the big screen.",8,0,1,22 December 2005
