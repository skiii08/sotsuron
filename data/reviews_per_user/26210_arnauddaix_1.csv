Your Name.," Long distance fantasy relationship becomes great love story!
","This is a movie that does not look like much at first; nothing fancy or groundbreaking, just the fantasy of a small town girl who wishes to change her life. And then, it just happens: seemingly at random, she shifts bodies with a teenage boy, and a relationship starts. As they get to know each other, the feelings show and something settles, until suddenly, it all stops. No more exchanges, and the boy starts forgetting. All that remains is a nagging feeling that he is looking for somebody, but does not remember her name... This movie is beautiful in its simplicity, and the emotions it brings up. It does not try to explain the why and the how, but rather to make the viewer feels. And it succeeds. While it could be considered slow at times, each moment contributes towards the evolution of the story and the ending. Very much worth a watch!",9,3,4,3 August 2017
