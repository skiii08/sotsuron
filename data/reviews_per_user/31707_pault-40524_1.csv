Hereditary," Overhyped nonsense
","The trailer for this film is absolutely brilliant. It portrays what you believe will be the plot for the film - Odd looking girl inherits some kind of satanic force from her recently deceased and secretive grandmother, goes on the rampage in brilliantly horrific fashion , family are powerless to stop her.If only this were the case. The major unexpected twist is that we lose the odd looking creepy girl fairly early in the film. This was a great twist, it completely caught me off guard. 
At this point I'm genuinely interested and shocked and looking forward to whatever else may lay ahead, which turns out to be nothing more than another hour and half of confusing, boring ,unintentionally amusing, and sometimes annoying nothingness ,leading up to the most disappointing and ridiculous ending to a horror film that I've ever seen.I can't fault the acting, I think everyone played their roles well and is the only reason I gave this four stars. I left the cinema feeling conned and bemused. The film is far too overhyped and is definitely not 'this generations The Exorcist'.",4,1,2,20 June 2018
