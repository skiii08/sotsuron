The Blair Witch Project," Crappy special effects!
","If you like movies made by amateurs with a very small budget, then mabe you'll like the Blair Witch project.I personally didn't like the movie. There were no special effects at all really. I could've made the movie myself, with somebody holding a camera for me, while I run and scream that I can't find my way out of wherever I am.I will say the acting was not bad at all. In fact, these actors and actresses in this film will likely have bright careers ahed of them.In conclusion, I will say the acting was good. However, the story and the way it was filmed was pretty bad.",Null,0,1,30 May 2000
