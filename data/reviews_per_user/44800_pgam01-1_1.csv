The Longest Yard," Totally awesome movie
","Yeah, this movie has it all. Great Great Great laugh your butt off movie. Filled with humor, action, twists and turns, filled with revenge and football this movie is one of those movies where its still funny after the 20th time. No parts were there when you feel bored, this movie is filled with action packed humor. This movie was such a great and booming box office hit that swept the nation. This totally regenerated film from the 1970 changed the hole aspect of not rooting for the better team, but rooting for the underdogs. Definitely Definitely Definitely recommend it. Definitely one of my now all time favorite movies if i had more thumbs I would use them in this situation but since I only have 12, ill have to say 12 thumbs up. Ha, Buy it, Rent it, I want you to see this movie.",10,1,4,11 November 2005
