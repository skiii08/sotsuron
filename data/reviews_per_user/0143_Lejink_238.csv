"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Not so fast
","Fair to middling Brit-com, centring on amusing ordinary, average guy Simon Pegg's attempts to win back his improbably beautiful girlfriend, Thandie Newton, from a slick yuppie American. Of course it's 'The Full Monty' (maybe this subliminally excuses two shots of Dylan Moran's bare behind!) in running gear but the movie never quite gets out of the starting blocks. As indicated earlier, it's hard to accept Pegg & Newton as a natural couple and the rest of the cast are a bit too eccentric and haphazard too, taking in prominently the afore-mentioned Moran as Pegg's best pal who in between dropping his trousers, flits in and out of a minor league gambling den and also Pegg's long-suffering Asian landlord who again somewhat improbably becomes his assistant coach. My problem is that the characters don't mesh together and the narrative is painted in too-broad strokes. 'The Full Monty' worked because the characters were believable and the ensemble acting so good, even if the basic premise, like here, seems unlikely. Pegg does garner some sympathy and amusement by turns as he takes to the streets (he is a sight in his tight running shorts!) but by the time his 'Tough of the Track' performance has won the hearts of the nation as well, of course as Newton's, you're left not quite caring enough nor do you feel you've laughed enough on the journey. But a fairly pleasant undemanding watch all the same.",5,7,10,21 December 2007
Saturday Night Fever," I'll Bet He Looks Good On The Dance Floor
","Timing as they say is everything. The confluence of rising director John Balham, new face John Travolta in the lead role and the insertion of a soundtrack powered by the newly discofied Bee Gees saw the high watermark of disco music as both movie and soundtrack broke box office and chart records at the time.That said, I wonder what the teenage audience who flocked to the cinema made of what is actually at times a pretty gritty urban drama set in contemporary New York. It gets off to a great start with the now-iconic image of Travolta's Tony Manero cruising down the streets, hair perfectly coiffured, dressed to kill, checking his appearance in every mirror, his step in perfect syncopation with the anthemic 'Stayin' Alive' booming out in the background. From there we're introduced to Tony's world, well-liked shop boy by day, troublesome young adult at home to his Italian parents, dad a feckless do-nothing and mum hung up on religion, lionising her other son who's already joined the priesthood to Tony's comparative detriment. However it's outside shop hours and home time that he really comes alive, running about with his similarly sharp-dressed teenage gang boys but in particular coming alive at the local disco where he takes as much care over his dance moves as he does his personal appearance.Sub-plots involving other characters also happen by, like the rivalry with another gang in the neighbourhood, his regular girl dancing partner who wants more than that and the return of his brother who has summarily given up his religious calling much to the disappointment of both parents who seem to somehow blame Tony's influence for this family catastrophe. The main story is Tony's interest in the hot new girl who comes to the disco and catches his eye with her slick dance moves. Mix in a little Sharks and Jets turf war and a dash of the tragedy born of bravado from 'Rebel Without A Cause' and you arrive at a fairly downbeat ending, with just the hope that Tony has now matured and is ready to grow up and face his adult responsibilities.So, a coming-of-age contemporary musical drama with a new, young cast which might have disappeared without trace if it wasn't for those great Bee Gees songs and Travolta's star turn, particularly when he's dancing to their music. I personally could have done without the misogynistic treatment of women with some of the sexual encounters with females bordering on rape and the casual racism in some of the dialogue but director Badham certainly seems to capture the authenticity of late 70's street life in the poorer backstreets of NYC and like I said obviously recognised the benefits of centring the film round Travolta's electric performance and those hit songs of the Brothers Gibb.",6,0,0,11 November 2019
The Avengers," They can be heroes
","I'm really more of a DC guy and watched this movie well out of synch with other related Marvel films and TV series I've watched previously but even as some of the finer points of the narrative went over my head somewhat, nevertheless this epic team-up of four (plus two) major super-heroes was an absolute blast. The two and a half hour viewing time absolutely flew by making this one of the best blockbusters I've seen from the comic universe. The longer playing time allows plenty of room for character development as well as initial face-offs between Iron Man and Captain America and later Hulk and Thor to whet the appetite for the all-action SFX fest finale, when the heroes, plus Black Widow and Hawkeye, finally get their act together to repel the Chitauri alien invasion plotted by Loki. All the main characters get more or less equal on-screen exposure apart possibly from Hulk but his delayed appearance is of course in line with the surprise element his transformation engenders and is very much worth the wait in any case. There's room for humour too, unsurprisingly in the main from cynical Tony Stark / Iron Man and some sight gags too, like the Hulk's slightly overdone fist-pump with Thor and also his later take-down of Loki after a suitably grandiose speech by the latter. As the most successful individual performer in the franchise, it's not a huge shock to see Iron Man save the day this time but fans of the individual heroes will all be satisfied with how their favourites are treated I'm sure. Besides the heroes, Tom Hiddlestone makes for a convincingly asinine Loki, Samuel J Jackson gets to jut and chomp a lot as Nick Fury and the likable Clark Greig impresses as Fury's straight-arrow right-hand man Coulson. The effects are literally out-of-this-world as New York is laid-waste by the invading Chitauri and their massive caterpillar-type spaceship and individual 'Silver Surfer'-type jet-ski flying machines. Sure you have to suspend a lot of disbelief as the super six take on and defeat an army of it would appear thousands but it is the comics after all.It seems to me Marvel is well ahead of DC in the movie stakes certainly if this all-action mega-hit is anything to go by. I look forward to its inevitable follow-up.",8,2,6,15 November 2014
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Pink-knuckle adventure
","At one point in the movie, near the end, Ed Harris' character Mitch says to his rival, our hero Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates 'No more puzzles' after which I breathed a sigh of relief - how many more elaborate mysteries linked to historical buildings or monuments could the writers concoct.This is big-time, big-budget Hollywood holiday adventure aimed at your average thirteen year old and what it hopes and indeed probably believes is the thirteen year old in all of us. Thus we get high-tech thrills you can easily imagine playing on your PC, with very little sex and violence to upset the censor.More seasoned viewers will probably see it for what it is - an amalgam of proved and tested blockbusters from recent years - taking in Indiana Jones type exoticism, adding in a touch of The Da Vinci Code's Alex 's ability to decipher the most arcane clues plus the 'Pirates of The Caribbean' trick of adapting a Disneyland theme park to the big screen. Plus of course there's a nerdy computer geek who can hack into the London Police computer system quicker than you can say 'Evenin' All', but it's okay, computer anoraks everywhere, even he gets a Ferrari (outrageous piece of product placement, right there) and a girl by the end.The acting is perfunctory - ridiculous to see Helen Mirren in particular wasted on fluff like this and to be honest, nobody ever really seems to be in any danger at all. That said, there are some nice location shots at Buckingham Palace and Mount Rushmore and the recreation of the City of Gold is certainly impressive.I don't want to be too hard on this film, it didn't displease me, but it wasn't smart enough to insert telling humour to leaven the journey and at no point did I feel my hands gripping the arms of my chair as a good adventure really should.",4,0,0,22 January 2011
Blade Runner 2049," Deckard's Midnight Runners
","Looking back at an old review of mine for 'Blade Runner', certainly one of the highest rated films here, I can see I wasn't quite convinced by it. Thinking it may have been more me than the movie, taking the chance to watch this much belated but certainly much anticipated follow-up, I determined to take my time with it, pretty essential considering its 163 minute length, and really try to digest and appreciate it.I must admit I found the plotting a little difficult to follow, but just about got there in the end. Ryan Gosling is in the lead part as K a replicant hunter working for his unforgiving boss Robin Wright, who starts to suspect that he himself is a replicant born of a replicant mother, with its wider implications for any humans v replicants conflict in the future.It's not long before the trail leads him to Harrison Ford's Agent Deckard, the suspected father of the lost child and therefore maybe his own father, but both hunters are themselves being hunted by a murderous female assassin, inappropriately named Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), employed by the villainous Wallace Corporation whose blind, in more ways than one, leader has his own agenda as regards the preservation of the status quo in society.There's not a lot of dialogue in the film and what there is, tends more to the monosyllabic, which gives the viewer time to take in the excellent sets, including a massive space-junkyard, the slumdog shantytown populated by child-slaves and the once-upon-a-time luxurious Las Vegas hotel where Deckard is now holed up. The special effects are also impressive ranging from the large-scale, like when K's space-mobile crashes, to the small-scale holographic visuals when K's holographic girl-friend is superimposed onto a real prostitute for a love-making scene, the recreation of Sean Young's Rachael character from the original film and even the Frank and Elvis images which return to their old Vegas stamping-ground to entertain Deckard in his solitude. There are also two effective death scenes, one short and very much to the point, the other extended and climactic under crashing waves.I couldn't fault the acting either. Gosling, Wright, Hoeks and Ford's characters are all different shades of humourless, world-weary, intensity in this bleak afterworld but each personalises their performance into effective dare I say human individuals. There's also a suitably moody electronic soundtrack adding atmospheric weight and even a nod to Vangelis's original soundtrack at the end.Ridley Scott, the director of the first 'Runner' and who executive-produced 2049, felt the final cut here could have lost half an hour which might have helped the movie's disappointing box-office but I'm glad we got to see new director Villeneuve's grand if dark vision of how this particular story should play out.If there is to be a third entry in the series, let's hope it doesn't take another 36 years to materialise otherwise it will have to be a holograph of me who reviews it!",7,0,3,16 December 2019
Angels & Demons," Rome if you want to...
","Haven't read any Dan Brown, so had no pre-conceptions about the movie, although I had seen its 'The Da Vinci Code' predecessor, while my wife, who has read the novel, says that the film is true to it. To me though it did look very like 'Da Vinci Code 2', not unnaturally given that most of the original component parts were there again - obviously Brown as writer, Howard as director, Hanks as star, Zimmer as resident composer etc etc.I must admit though that it came across to me as a preposterous, empty, only occasionally flashy thriller. The hope of the writer, no doubt was that by basing the sources on ancient lore and setting the action in modern day locations, this heft would give credence to the events on the screen, but it's all too unbelievable for words.Hanks' character, it seems, has the uncanny ability to decipher ultra-complicated arcane clues in minutes (he has one hour between the scheduled executions of pope-aspiring cardinals, which are the prelude to the big-bang anti-matter cataclysm, set for midnight) only to race around a darkened and crowded Rome to unerringly arrive just after the deed has already been done! He does however divine enough to eventually save the last of the scheduled victims and of course be on hand to save Vatican City from destruction at which point we learn it wasn't about the mysterious Illuminati Group's 400-years-in-the-making grand revenge against The Vatican but about papal legate Ewan McGregor's fiendish plot to assume the papacy himself...I'm aware of the novel's massive popularity (which will propel the film to world-wide success, no doubt, like 'The Da Vinci Code' before it) but really the plot holes here are bigger than the Grand Canyon. Like when the Italian police, with Hanks and female sidekick scientist in tow, run into a seeming dead-end in one of the chosen churches, promptly abandon our would-be Holmes and Watson, who then, naturally discover a secret passage from the church to the Vatican. There's loads of stuff like this in the film and though director Howard tries to ratchet up the tension with clock graphics ticking down the minutes to midnight and employing Hans Zimmer's pounding, sub-Orff music to propel us to the next big-scene, it just gets crazier and crazier, to the frankly deranged conclusion of MacGregor's errant priest saving the Vatican by piloting a helicopter (handy he was in the Italian air-force as a young man!) up to safety, where the anti-matter explosion occurs relatively harmlessly before parachuting back to earth to be proclaimed a hero. But no, a twist as transparent as glass reveals the truth and normality is resumed on the ashes of MacGregor's ambitions.It must be hard to act such tosh convincingly and I'm not sure anyone succeeds. Hanks hovers between stolid and stodgy while MacGregor's accent makes regular return trips to and from Ireland as the film progresses. There are some spectacular special effects, notably the creation of the anti-matter 'God-particle' at the start and the pyrotechnics above the Vatican at the conclusion. In between there's poor continuity, for which the constantly interjected exposition fails to compensate and too much forced action set-pieces where Hanks might as well be running about with a big 'S' on his chest so intuitive and death-defying is his character.Anyway, Rome And Vatican City looked wonderful as they always do, but other than make me want to go back there sometime soon, this blockbuster left me cold and scratching my head about what all the fuss was about. Best just to accept it as a Harry Potter-type phenomenon, where with a sure-fire audience of the millions who've read the book, the film had to be made. The fact is though that it didn't and in my opinion shouldn't...",4,10,15,17 May 2009
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Golf war
","I know Americans love their golf, but even as a golf-lover and player myself, it seems to me it is a difficult sport in which to impart cinematic drama and though beautiful to look at, Robert Redford's gentle film treads a little too gently on the grass to really satisfy.Redford's recreation of the American South is gorgeous if sanitised to the point of caricature. The rich seem too rich and the poor too poor and for another thing there's a distinct lack of the expected good ol' boy prejudice in the air around Will Smith's black caddie. If, as others have suggested, this is down to his character's supernatural influence on everyone, why make him black at all? I wasn't completely convinced by the elusive nature of his Bagger Vance, even as I get the Hindu allusions in his character name and metaphysical impact on Matt Damon's Junuh character as helps him to 'find himself' at the same time upholding the sportsmanship of the game of golf as it used to be.I just thought the Zen and the golf made for awkward bed-fellows plus I also thought it wrong to accredit Damon's character with the key moment of sportsmanship in the film (when he calls a foul on himself that no-one else sees) when in real-life this was actually done by Bobby Jones himself, here portrayed merely as one of Junuh's playing partners.As for the acting, I usually like Matt Damon but felt his 'little-boy-lost' depiction seemed shallow, ditto Will Smith's beatific Vance while I also Charlize Theron's southern belle character a bit too rich and loud for my taste. Director Redford's cinematography as indicated is all soft-focus and golden-hued, tributing a by-gone age and there are some nice unobtrusive special effects inserted into the golf match between the two golfing greats and Damon's Junuh, especially the floodlit finale, but for me a golf-ball rolling into a hole just doesn't make for great cinema, unlike say a knockout punch at golf or a home-run hit in baseball.This is a lovingly made film by all concerned but I think in the end think I might have preferred a couple of hours myself on an actual golf course than cosy up to Redford's just- too-nice fantasy film.",6,0,2,14 February 2015
Vertigo," Great heights
","Hitchcock's masterpiece? Well, that's debatable, when there are at least six other major contenders I could think of. And yes, I've read the criticisms, about James Stewart being too old in the lead, the twist revealed half an hour before the ending, Judy's lack of surprise when Scottie turns up at her door and more, but in a great movie, you suspend these inconsistencies and instead let yourself get wrapped up in the whole experience.Right from the start, from Saul Bass's literally eye-popping title sequence and Bernard Hermann's hypnotic theme music, a spell is created although being Hitchcock, this is occasionally punctured with surprise elements. Immediately we're catapulted into a thrilling roof-top chase, culminating in the tragic consequences of Stewart's Scottie Ferguson character's vertigo. He seems to suffer a nervous breakdown and despite the devoted attention of the adoring Barbara Bel Geddes, he falls into a carefully contrived murder plot managed by an old friend, keen to inherit his wife's fortune. To do this, Scottie is manipulated into tailing and then building up a relationship with Kim Novak's Madeleine, yet another of the director's icy cool blondes, his vertigo ruthlessly exploited as the murder is perpetrated. However a chance meeting on the street with Madeleine's doppelgänger leads them both back to the scene of the crime with tragic consequences for both.I don't think there's another of Hitchcock's films where he displays his genius so well. The legendary fluidity of his camera we see time and again, it being particularly suited to the rise and fall of the streets of San Francisco as Scottie pursues his prey. Of course it's a sexy film and naturally being Hitchcock, there's a dark undercurrent to this, what with the 'romantic hero' indulging in something approaching necrophilia in recreating his dream (but dead) woman, plus just how does Madeleine end up naked in his bed, after he's saved her from drowning? The pacing is exemplary, at key points time is compressed for dramatic effect, at other times the camera languidly relaxes allowing the viewer to witness the wonderful cinematography of Frisco's landmarks in the bright Californian sunshine.The dramatic finish, where we're literally left hanging with Stewart and wondering what his next move will be atop the clock tower as his dream is destroyed a second time is a masterpiece of brevity and suspense.Essays have been written about this film almost since it was first released, itself a sign of the complexity and the depth at work here. I'm not one for re-watching films too much, preferring to see something I never have before, but 'Vertigo' keeps dragging me back in wonder and admiration of one of the masters of cinema at his considerable best.",9,1,2,24 March 2014
Black Swan," Ballet good show
","At last 'The Red Shoes' has some competition. An imaginatively daring movie with ballet as its main theme, with Natalie Portman cast in the title role as the shy but ambitious ingénue who unexpectedly wins the prize part of lead dancer in a new production of 'Swan Lake' and then finds herself pressurised into exploring the suppressed darker side if her on character to meet the demands of the part. The director really piles on the agony for her with almost clichéd characters of her pushy mother, handsome but exploitative director and jealously competitive rivals in the troop, but by constantly changing perspective, the viewer is never sure just what is going on. The camera is almost always in Portman's face or over her shoulder, conveying her growing paranoia and while her nightmare could on one level be easily attributed to a bad drug trip, she clearly had problems beforehand. I wasn't completely comfortable with some of the modernising aspects of the story, like the lesbian love scene, drug-taking and even the suggestion of incest, but there's no denying the dark momentum as her torment with some genuinely thrilling if disturbing moments on the way to her final apotheosis in the title part, especially the scene where she literally metamorphoses into the Black Swan character as she triumphantly overcomes a fall in her performance. The acting is a mixture of the stylised and naturalistic, contrasting the everyday with the other-worldly. There are no doubt deeper psychological interpretations open about Portman's Nina character with her awakening sexuality and mother complex prominent amongst them but I preferred to just watch the film as an oddly old-fashioned backstage melodrama and be swept along like the great ballet and of course wonderfully florid music it takes as its starting point. In this day and age of SFX comic-hero blockbusters, I was glad to engage with an old- fashioned if over-the-top psychological thriller which certainly kept me on my toes (sorry!) throughout.",7,0,2,6 July 2012
Changeling," A tale of two evils...
","Typical Eastwood fare here - serious subject, recent history period drama, bleak outlook with a touch of redemption for the leads at the end, this was nevertheless a powerful, engrossing expose of what passed for good policing in late 20's America. Taking the film at face value, this was a convincing depiction of pre-Depression America, with some great details - the roller-skating supervising in the telephone company by Angeline Jolie's Caroline Collins character in particular was a neat period-defining touch, whilst good use is made of exterior locations, at psychopathic murderer Northcott's 'chicken-coop' location, the train station where Jolie is 'reunited' with her supposed son and the recreation of her suburban neighbourhood equally with the interiors at the grisly 'psychiatric hospital' where Jolie is incarcerated, as well as the courtroom, police station and even the inside of Jolie's house. Atmosphere and realism are inset from the outset.The story, almost unbelievable in its premise, but bolstered by the 'based on a true story' legend over the opening titles (I'll research its claim later!) makes for tense and at times unbearable viewing as Jolie's Kafka-type nightmare almost fully envelops her and only comes into the light with the aid of an anti-corruption radio evangelist preacher and a cop who finally does his job right and actually listens to the crucial witness testimony of Northcott's unwilling teenage accomplice.The film however suffers a bit from being overlong in places, symptomatic of Eastwood's typical slow-paced style and there appear to be three or four endings tagged on one after the other, each good enough in itself to close the film before the credits roll. I also didn't feel the dual-trial scenes worked together, Eastwood possibly posting the question about just who the bigger villains actually were here, the psychopathic killer who completely believes in Jolie or the back-covering inhumanity of the Chief of Police and his chief officer who think nothing of foisting an impostor on a traumatised mother and then unbelievably throw her into a ruthlessly run psychiatric hospital to hush her protests. The acting is of a high standard. Early on, I did find Jolie a bit showy in her performance but she learns the less is more maxim as the film progresses, particularly as she descends into the bedlam of her psychiatric treatment where she witnesses and suffers almost inhuman cruelty and deprivation, before her release which sees her thence-forward display a telling stoic dignity in her pursuit of the truth. It's very much her film, although the support is strong in almost every other part too.Eastwood is now very settled in his style and any viewer knows they're not going to be jolted out of their seat by anything put in their way. His skill is in story-telling and here again, with the aid of fine cinematography and an effective soundtrack of his own composition, he delivers a shocking story in a credible and persuasive way to keep you rooted, most of the time anyway, in your seat for its 160 minute duration.",7,6,8,27 April 2009
Love and Death," Serfs up laffs
","Probably my favourite of Woody Allen's early comedies is this riotous send-up of Russian history and culture. Relating the life and times of a lowly Russian serf, at least, that it is, before the final reduction of expenses at the end, Allen is in full flow throughout with a non-stop barrage of scattergun gags most of which work and are laugh-out-loud funny.Helping out as she usually did at this stage in his career is Diane Keaton as his unrequited, later quited love-interest, distant cousin Sonja and the whole is a colourful romp with plenty of humour both low-brow and high-brow, as Allen lampoons, in no particular order, Napoleon, philosophy, Russian literature, Bergman and Eisenstein as well as the order of village idiots.Peppered with any number of hilarious comic scenes, from the seduction of a Spanish duke, to the duel with a cuckolded Russian general, the Napoleon assassination attempt and more, with the usual stop-by's for Allen's soliloquies to camera, it's beautifully shot and scored to a sparkling Prokofiev soundtrack.Detractors of Allen's latter-day conduct will find ammunition here in in an off-colour reference to the age-gap in relationships and especially a highly distasteful reference to twelve-year-old blonde schoolgirls but for the rest of the movie I must admit I was laughing long and hard.",8,2,3,30 March 2019
Frost_Nixon," You're so static
","Ironically and coincidentally I came to view this movie just days after finally watching 'All The President's Men' - cause and effect, before and after, call it what you will, I have to say that 'Frost/Nixon' made far less of an impression on me. Of course I appreciate the stylistic and narrative differences between the films, but as someone with an interest in recent 'current affairs', I was disappointed by this latest Ron Howard movie.Adapted from a critically successful play, I feel the movie never gets over the fact that it's a dramatisation of a series of television interviews - heaven help the upcoming film on the Bobby Fischer / Boris Spassky chess match from the early 70's I've been reading about in the upcoming schedules. While important in giving us insight into the final deconstruction of an already disgraced president, the movie has too great a conception of its own self-importance and I would argue that this examination of Tricky Dicky Nixon doesn't justify a two hour feature some 30 years on.There are also, for me, some too obvious character-traits handed out to the Frost & Nixon characters, being Frost's playboy dilettantism and Nixon's money-grasping bent. I also was thrown slightly by the lack of physical resemblance of the two main characters (if anything, Frank Langhella looks more like Ronald Reagan) and the fact that neither actor quite nails the distinctive voices of their real-life counterparts. Then there's the much commented-on dubiously invented drunken telephone-call from Nixon to Frost before the final interview, highlighting too obviously his paranoia (he even tapes the call!).Knowing pretty much the outcome also diluted the dramatic tension and the 'big' moment when Frost finally pries out Nixon's confession to illegality is also skewered by the too-cinematic reactions of the interested parties looking on.As to Howard's direction, I feel that the on-screen interview scenes could have been presented more tautly and that the framing device of post-event 'interviews' with the actors playing the supporting characters was too clever for its own good. As for the acting, as stated I never really felt I was watching Frost and Nixon at all and was reminded of the Kevin Costner 'starrer' '11 Days' which using similar cinematic devices got over far better the import of its subject matter - namely the Cuban Air Crisis of 1961. The action here is all in the dialogue, crippling the movie with a sense of stasis from which it never really elevates.On the whole then, though a bold enterprise by the production team, I'm not sure that this particular play warranted the movie treatment. I'm now scurrying through You Tube and the like for the original footage of the interviews. Sometimes you don't need the background to the main event, sometimes the event itself is enough.",5,2,5,28 October 2009
Walk the Line," Cash on delivery
","I'm no fan of country music with its corny 'somebody done somebody wrong' lyrics, yee-ha vocals and gloopy strings, but Johnny Cash was definitely different. Although not quite the icon here in the UK that he undoubtedly was in his native America, his 'outlaw' stance, along with his hard-living ways and honest lyrics for my money put him a country mile (ouch!) ahead of the current crop of mega-successful but anodyne superstars. Pop culture bio-pics have been intermittently successful at the box-office and 'Walk the Line' was quick to follow the success of 'Ray' in celebrating the wayward life of a one-time neglected but lately revered musical giant and there's no doubt Cash was deserving of the accolade. The film itself is fine to look at, capturing especially well in its early sequences, vistas of the American South, back-dropping young John's cotton-picking days with its attendant tension in his family life, particularly his strained relationship with his taciturn, hard-drinking father, exacerbated after the accidental death of his (and his father's favourite) adored older brother. The director seems to mix Cash's story up with blues-man Robert Johnson who surely cornered the rights to images about cross-roads, which recur frequently in the movie, in any case it's a hackneyed image at the best of times. The movie follows the parabolas in Cash's career up to his inspired and ultimately triumphant return to glory in 1968 when he recorded his seminal 'Live at Folsom Prison' album, although I would argue his greater triumph was achieved at the end of his life when he collaborated with Rick Rubin even as he was dying of cancer. Interesting to compare the time-line of his career with another Southern boy, Elvis, whose stellar career was foundering until he too in 1968 made his comeback with his 'From Memphis to Vegas' album and TV Special. Although enjoyable and well acted (and sung), the movie does suffer from Joaquin Phoenix's inability to convey the sheer presence of the man; wearing black shirts and dropping his voice a notch or two not being enough for me for him to truly get into character. A similar lack of veracity affects the depiction of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and other rockers from that era, - I can't believe in a nation full of Elvis impersonators the casting company couldn't have come up with a better look- and sound-alike than we get here. Reese Wotherspoon is fine in the role of the elusive and effusive June Carter, the love of his life although I wouldn't have marked her performance as Oscar-worthy. Parts of the movie seem apocryphal too (did Cash really happen by Sun Studios just as Elvis was setting up?) but generous dramatic licence has been the watchword of screen biographies since the year dot so I'll let that and others of its ilk pass. In conclusion then an entertaining pass at a big man's up and down life, but in the end the real deal is Cash's heartbreaking video rendition of Trent Raznor's 'Hurt', a life encapsulated in only four minutes. The man truly came around...",7,0,0,29 September 2008
Gremlins," Monster Christmas
","I've been seeking out some Christmas related films I'd not seen before and wondering why my wife to this day still utters 'Bright lights' when ever a room is lit up suddenly and talks about 'Gizmo eyes', I decided to follow her recommendation and watch it with her.I'm broadly aware of Joe Dante's reputation for spoof monster flicks and to be fair, I'll cut him some slack for mashing up a cutesy Christmas movie supposedly centring on a teenage boy's predilection for unusual and cuddly pets with a vintage monster movie with lots of outlandish and ghoulish deaths along the way. The film just about works by switching between the two modes at will, keeping the viewer on the hop all the time, indeed he serves notice of his intentions by interspersing classic film clips of quite different movies, 'It's A Wonderful Life' and 'Them' for instance.Although many of the attack scenes are plain silly, like when Billy's mother takes on four Gremlins in her kitchen and especially the demise of Mrs Deagle which must have set back the sales of chairlifts at the time, Dante generally gets away with mixing up the goofy with the gore, even if to me the Gremlins themselves looked no more dangerous than Animal from 'The Muppets'.A strange mixture then but perhaps not a movie to play for the very young on Christmas Eve.",5,3,6,29 December 2012
Mission: Impossible III," Mission the mark
","I'm biased, me... I'm old enough to remember and revere the 60's original and better yet got to view them all again (and I do mean all) recently on a classic TV satellite channel, with the great cast of the ultra-cool Steven Hill, ultra-resourceful Martin Landau and ultra-beautiful Barbara Bain, in neat, intricately plotted story lines, wrapped up in 50 entertaining minutes. You were lucky in the TV show if a gun was shot in anger far less saw helicopters fly in and out of a jungle of wind-powered generators as 'MI3' improbably starts. They even get the 'Your mission, Jim...' prelude wrong by fatally delaying its entry and playing it completely wrong.I actually have no problem with the re-launch of the franchise in the 90's and beyond and remember thrilling to the previous De Palma and John Woo-helmed predecessors, it's just that this third outing looks too often like a computer game converted into a movie (a la 'Tomb Raider', 'Resident Evil' and no doubt 'Time Crisis' to come!) rather than the other way round and as well as re-hashing a lot of the stuff from numbers 1 & 2 (which means more face-morphing, base jumps et al.), it also cops from other high-adrenaline thrill-fests past and present. Most obvious is a bridge-sundering cataclysm last seen in 'True Lies', but there are so many echoes of any other number of recent Bourne and Bond flicks that I stopped counting.The best scenes reminded me of the TV series, notably a cleverly staged, slickly actioned kidnapping of Philip Seymour-Hoffman's master-villain Michael Davian (although when they morphed Cruise's face into Hoffman's he somehow seems to develop the latter's paunch too!) but there were too few of these. The rest is bluster, flashy but empty pyrotechnics on the ground and in the air, painfully corny lovey-dovey nonsense between Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and his new missus ('On Her Majesty's Secret Service' anyone?) and the requisite empty buddy-buddy bonding between Cruise and the rest of his team.And as for the acting, well Tom runs and runs and runs - more even than he did in 'The Firm' and of course comes back from the dead at the end to save the world and his honeymoon. Hoffman is probably the best of the bunch, if still a lesser presence than Dougray Scott in MI2 while Simon Pegg gets a sub-Cleese/Dench cameo part as Cruise's nerdy tech-guy Benji (Benji !?!).Don't get me wrong, the two hours watching-time went past quickly and I was nevr bored. However it all made for arather hollow by-rote experience. Time for Ethan and his crew to leave the field for better exponents of this particular art - I'm thinking of Mr Bourne and a certain Mr wayne in Gotham City. To paraphrase the old Bond song, somebody does it better...!",5,0,4,16 May 2009
Source Code," Terse code
","I love films or TV programmes that play with the idea of circular time and this movie is an especially good example. Like most of its type, it takes a little while to actually suss what exactly is going on, but once you settle into the rhythm of it, this is a taut, intriguing thriller which keeps you watching until the end.I got the references to the 80's TV show 'Quantum Leap' right down to Scott Bakula's off-screen cameo as the voice of Jake Ghyllenhaal's character's father and of course it's not hard to see links to the likes of 'Groundhog Day', 'Speed' and even the old Powell & Pressburger classic 'A Matter Of Life And Death' amongst others that I no doubt missed.Perhaps a little too much is compressed into the film's 90 minute running time, the way for instance that Ghyllenhaal so quickly finds first the bomb and then the bomber and possibly the freeze-frame moment on the train at the end is a bit too happy-clappy, but these sins are quite easy to forgive, given the main body of evidence here.Gyllenhaal and Monaghan convey an easy chemistry in their recurring 8 minute relationship and Vera Farmiga is also fine as the programmer with a heart who gives in to her humanity in allowing Gylenhaal's character a dignified release after he duly saves the world.All in all, this was a good thriller, well edited, shot and played delivering a race against time actioner alongside a make-you-think premise on alternative realities.",7,0,1,13 July 2011
Skyfall," Future to the back
","After the soulless mess that was 'Quantum of Solace', it was important that James Bond's next outing get the franchise back on track and to a degree 'Skyfall' does that. Much more like 'Casino Royale' which was Daniel Craig's first outing as 007, here again we see greater concentration on character, with Bond entering the post-modern era with questions over his fallibility, age and even childhood brought to the fore. Again, the use of established 007 motifs like glamorous Bond girls and weapons gimmickry are largely curtailed indeed the most prominent female relationship James enjoys here is with his boss M, played by Judi Dench. Personally, I've been critical of this development so that I'm not unhappy with the outcome at the end of this movie, where hopefully we can see Bond move on with a bit less emotional baggage, taking on megalomaniac would-be world conquerors once again, I hope!It all starts encouragingly enough with a thrilling chase on motorbike, car and train, introducing the rather simple plot line of a disgruntled former MI6 operative's grand revenge scheme against M but of course this doesn't prevent the use of glamorous locations like Shanghai and Istanbul as well as more down-to-earth locales like central London and the Scottish Highlands. There's intrigue initially as we're made to wait for Bond to reappear from his apparently certain death (how he does so isn't explained, just assumed) while MI6's computer security is hacked by M's pursuer, which brings Bond and his boss into a proximity that lasts the whole of the film.Underlying the main story is the sub-text of Bond's personal struggle to stay relevant and competitive in his field, but this is overplayed when he rendezvous with a new, younger, geeky Q at the National Gallery in front of Turner's symbolic (for Bond) 'The Fighting Temerare'. I didn't like this new Q, a sop to younger viewers and also didn't like Albert Finney as Bond's old ghillie in the Highlands, with old Albert not even attempting a native Scottish accent.The film rumbles on with an attempt on M's life at Parliament, with tasty nostalgic morsels thrown at older fans to keep us interested, like the beautiful old silver Aston Martin, complete with ejector seat and his favourite drink wordlessly inserted into the piece. However the linking between the action scenes isn't always engaging and besides, Javier Barden looks more like a demented Boris Johnston than the psychotic mastermind he's meant to be and I also can't think why Moneypenny has to be black either.The movie's certainly an improvement on 'Quantum' but could have done with sharper editing and a clearer focus on what kind of Bond film it wanted to be. A bit like James himself, the film has a bit of an identity crisis, but just about recovers itself in time, leaving hope that his next outing will be better again.",6,1,4,15 October 2013
The Young Victoria," Victoria stationary
","Yet another historical costume drama this time focusing on the early years of queen-at- eighteen Victoria and in particular her burgeoning relationship to her adored Prince Albert. Cue the soft focus and romantic music as Hollywood trains its trademark feather-light examination on the UK monarchy, having the too pretty and much too old Emily Blunt play the title role and Paul Bettany much too young as the elderly Prime Minister Lord Melbourne as her mentor and escape route out of the clutches of her weak-willed mother and the grasping, ambitious Sir John Conroy as the latter's controller and alleged lover.Somewhere beneath the well-presented pageantry and pomp, there probably is a good dramatic story trying to emerge but every scene it seems has to contain a resonant phrase or utterance to make you admire the writing, rather than allowing the characters to reveal their true selves with more everyday speech.I didn't like the shallow, showy acting of Blunt and Rupert Friend could play his part in modern dress, so little does he connect with the time and place of the action. Jim Broadbent gives his typical good turn as the blustering King Willam IV but Miranda Richardson shows that she played costumed nobility much better for laughs (as in 'Black Adder') than here when she plays it straight, although that tricky German accent might have thrown her off.No, for me this too sanitised, too fawning, too calculating production looks all too much as if it was aimed at either the Academy and / or the US box-office, which I'm not unhappy to see it failed in both respects.",4,4,7,19 February 2012
The Hangover," Slightly hungover...
","It's not often a frat-type comedy (only this time with adults) enjoys the financial success or peer recognition and there's no doubt there was / is about this particular movie, so with my interest piqued I settled down to an expected laugh-fest...only to be a little let down and underwhelmed by what I saw.In its favour, it boasts Las Vegas as its principal location backdrop, an engaging cast of mostly unknowns and a plot which resembles, if distantly, that of 'Memento', only with a comic twist as our three intrepids seek to retrace their steps the morning after a particularly heavy-duty drug-fuelled night before, which sees them 'lose' their erstwhile buddy on his stag night. A good deal of the comedy borders on the surreal, taking in a call-girl and her baby who gets hitched Vegas-style to the put-upon dental doctor, an Oriental crime-lord who wants his casino winning restored in return for their kidnapped buddy and unbelievably washed up boxer Iron Mike Tyson and entourage, including his pet tiger. All the missing gaps are restored to the guys in a clever montage of still photographs as the titles roll as the groom gets, just, to his wedding on time...It's all performed with great gusto to an almost ever-present modern-day soundtrack and I can certainly see how the film would take with thirty-somethings and under. Being myself, however, much the wrong side of thirty (or forty come to that), I found the humour just too broad and slapdash for me. Going by the movie's box-office take, many millions of cinema-goers and from the high average mark, a great majority of IMDb reviewers obviously beg to differ, but at least I was spared the total-gross-out experience I feared at the outset.",5,0,2,10 February 2010
Ghost," In this our afterlife
","So it was a cold and wet Sunday afternoon, prematurely dark outside. My wife and I had just got in from walking our dog just before the rain really started and there was no question we weren't venturing out again. I asked her what film she thinks we should watch and she says 'a nice one'. I flick through various selections and she stops me at 'Ghost'. She saw it years ago in original release but I've never seen it, so 'Ghost' it was.Turned out to be a good choice. I've always been a sucker for fantasy movies dealing with visitations from the afterlife and whatnot, going back to 'Topper', 'The Bishop's Wife' and of course the daddy of them all 'It's A Wonderful Life' and 'Ghost' unquestionably taps into all of that, with good ghosts hanging around their loved ones until they find release through redemption, ascending to the light while bad ghosts don't get to stay long, getting immediately dragged down to the nether regions by irresistible black forces. This latter turns out to be very convenient for Patrick Swayze's nice-guy Sam Wheat character when two of his enemies later die on him in hot pursuit.Sam doesn't get to last too long in his physical form, being slain in front of his loving girlfriend, Demi Moore's Molly by what seems to be a random mugger. When Moore is later consoled by Sam's best friend and banking work-colleague Carl, the bigger picture quickly became clearer, leading to a reasonably exciting if slightly over-the-top conclusion as Sam races to save Molly from joining him in the hereafter as the bad guys come after her.Of course, to communicate with Molly, Sam has to find a suitable conduit so enter Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae fake medium character and an entertaining sub-plot caper where she and Sam conspire to thwart Carl's embezzlement plans in person at the bank as well as the inevitable scenes where Goldberg first becomes aware of his at first unwelcome presence and later when she's trying to convince Moore of Sam's 'existence'.Sure there are slushy bits too, like the oft-parodied (and very suggestive!) pottery scene to the backdrop of The Righteous Brothers' 'Unchained Melody', making the film a woman's favourite ever since, but that may be as much to do with big old handsome Patrick as anything else. Undoubtedly though he and Moore are two of the beautiful people, living the life in downtown New York, but they combine well and have you rooting for them all the way through. Goldberg gets to do her goofy, sometimes histrionic comedy thing but she's kept just about in check by the direction. The special effects, for the time, are fine, particularly all the out-of-body stuff.Such was the success of the movie on original release that 'Unchained Melody' was re- released as a single in the UK due to the popularity of this film and raced to number 1 in the charts (which it never did on original issue) but I can see why. It's a warming, life- affirming entertaining movie and good clean family entertainment, an old-fashioned Hoolywood movie in the best tradition - and what's wrong with that, as someone once said?",7,3,5,29 November 2015
Iron Man 3," Not ferrous good
","I really liked the first two Iron Man films. They were flashy, techy, exciting and even funny at times. With Robert Downey Junior in the title role, the producers had the perfect fit for not only the Iron Man but also the wise-cracking playboy millionaire inventor behind the mask.This third outing though is a big let down. The plot is a mess, with Guy Pearce hamming it up as a sort of meta-human Terminator 2, out to humiliate the U.S. via the kidnap of their president, using another super-villain The Mandarin as the medium to initially spread fear and panic amongst the general public with various Bin Laden type terrorist actions. Unfortunately for America and naturally the free world, Iron Man is between costumes and not operating at full strength so that even with the assistance of the similarly-powered War Machine / Iron Patriot, he's pushed to his limits in the expected mayhem-inducing final battle between the two.So what has gone wrong? For one thing Iron Man doesn't appear in armour very much in the film (although his previous prototypes come to the rescue by the end) - I don't know, maybe Downie Junior wanted more face-time on screen. The suit-on, suit-off routine is greatly overdone and the in-suit commentaries, this time by two costumed heroes, grate too, while the climactic battle would be more properly termed an anti-climactic battle. The idea of Ben Kingsley's Wizard of Oz-like Mandarin doesn't serve the character well and by now Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts character is very irritating too. Worst of all there are two awkward and embarrassing condescensions to the comic-fan base and I guess target cinema-audience too as Downey Junior is forced into cringe-worthy, humourless scenes with a savvy pre-teen kid and later an adult nerd-fan in a van. With an incessant, booming, rock soundtrack just to round things off, I saw this in the end as a poorly written, routinely filmed and ultimately empty blockbuster which doesn't bode well for future entries in the franchise.Time to get out the WD40, methinks.",2,1,3,13 June 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana wants me
","I'm not the biggest fan of either Steven Spielberg or Harrison Ford come to that. 'E.T.', 'Close Encounters', the whole 'Star Wars' thing, hate them all. But this is different. I do love a swashbuckling adventure movie and here Spielberg gives us the ultimate old- fashioned actioner. Spielberg has described his Indiana Jones as his take on James Bond, only with less intrigue and less sex but with more excitement and levity. Like Bond Indy has his own signature theme tune, gets a spine tingling big-budget opening prologue, can fight like the blazes and of course, gets the girl. Setting the movie during the Second World War provides easily identifiable baddies in the form of the pursuing Nazis and also means it has much less reliance on modern gimmicks and gadgets. If anything though the set-piece action sequences are better here than anything surely done to date even whilst some of the stunts recall Golden Age Hollywood, for example Indy's crawl under a speeding truck is only a variation of the same under an out of control wagon in many a Western of yore.Richly shot, the set constructions are excellent, the outside locations are radiantly captured, the special effects and stunts are great, I especially liked Spielberg's imaginative use of silhouettes in some of the scenes. The script is tight and witty and is clever enough to preface later actions with earlier clues, like Alice's drinking ability and Indy's fear of snakes. There are also some nice throwaway comedic lines with not a raised eyebrow in sight. The destructive effects of the Ark fully live up to dread expectation in the Germans' submarine bay but other highlights include the afore-mentioned car-chase and Jones' short and sweet encounter with a surprise whip-waving adversary.As a great lover of old Hollywood plot-thin action-packed blockbusters, this could hardly be bettered with Harrison Ford echoing the spirit of Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Stewart Grainger. This is one of those rare movies which is as much fun as it looks like it was to make and thoroughly deserved its huge box-office success.",9,0,0,12 September 2015
Spartacus," There's a Thrace For Us
","Still, for me, the granddaddy of the sword and sandal epics, I wanted to rewatch this, one of my favourite movies, in tribute to the late, great, recently deceased Kirk Douglas. I'm actually not that big a fan of Kubrick, considering his film-work very hit and miss and yet this is the film of his I like most, even after learning, surprisingly, that he disowned it on release.I've read about the supposed disagreements over the direction of the screenplay and the rumoured head-butting of the acting talent, but to me all or any of this is subsumed into the grand sweep and vision of the movie. I try to imagine what it looked like when it first hit the big screen, it must have seemed huge, even after the previous, recent success of the similarly monumental 'The Ten Commandments' and 'Ben Hur'.Perhaps one of the reasons I like 'Spartacus' more than 'Ben Ten' is its lack of religiosity. A simple and stirring story of the uprising of the downtrodden, there are of course possible read-acrosses in Dalton Trumbo's screenplay to the Hollywood Blacklist, or the treatment of the Jewish people in the Second World War and if the allegory fits then by all means wear it, but I prefer to let it stand in its own as a great and involving, if admittedly historically inaccurate tale, brought to life in the grand Hollywood manner by great direction, writing, cinematography and acting.Douglas of course never won an individual acting Oscar for any of his film performances, which I consider ridiculous when I think of 'Champion', 'The Bad And The Beautiful', 'Paths Of Glory' and my favourite of all his roles 'Ace In The Hole', to name but four. I think he's terrific here as the rebellious Thracian slave, athletic, inspiring and manly but also sensitive and fair-minded. He gets fine support from those two English stalwarts, Lawrence Olivier as the intractable Crassus, although still with an eye it would seem for a young man or woman on the side and Charles Laughton as the seasoned Gracchus, with Tony Curtis and Jean Simmons fine also as Spartacus's young right-hand man and calming partner respectively. Almost stealing the show however is Peter Ustinov, back in the toga, as the weaselly Batiatus.Kubrick directs unhurriedly, letting the grand story develop naturally before the climactic battle at the end and of course the famous 'I am Spartacus' scene which has entered the lexicon of popular culture. His mastery of composition and the panoramic shot and crowd scenes in particular, assisted by Douglas Sirk's great cameraman Russel Metty, bring the story to life in vivid colour assisted by Alex North's stirring soundtrack.Undoubtedly a massively ambitious cinematic undertaking, Kubrick and Douglas in my opinion certainly pull it off and I personally still consider it a true classic of cinema.R.I.P. Mr Douglas.",9,0,1,12 February 2020
Casablanca," Play it again and again
","Like all great art, 'Casablanca' is a film that stands repeat viewings time after time, until you get to the point where you're saying whole lines of dialogue in lip-synch with the actors. I've just watched it again for the umpteenth time and still get caught up in the foreign intrigue, instinctive direction and superb playing of all the leads.The film's screenplay has won awards as the best ever, which is of course ironic considering it was going through rewrites right up until shooting and the actors themselves didn't always understand the convoluted plotting. Perhaps their uncertainty helps give the film its edge, no-one quite knows how it's all going to finish until the pieces fall perfectly into place in the closing ten minutes at the airfield.With more classic lines than any other film I can think of, including the most misquoted one ever, every plot and sub-plot is deftly handled and resolved. Moreover, it was undoubtedly brave of Warner's to take a patriotic stand at a time when the war was going badly for the Allies and one can only imagine the boost to morale the famous scene, when the patrons of Rick's Place drown out the provocative would-be triumphal and mocking singing of the German soldiers with their heartfelt rendition of the Marseillaise, gave to watching filmgoers in free Europe, especially France.At its heart of course is a love story, a beautiful, twisted, dangerous and ultimately doomed love story, but it never upsets the balance of the film which helps it to ultimately satisfy on so many levels.The acting, of course, is beyond reproach, Bogart as the cynical bar-owner with a conscience, Bergman, luminously beautiful but subtle and sensitive as she guards her heart, Rains, brilliant as the weather-vane local cop playing every angle and Heinreid as the noble, brave partisan who's also enough of a man of the world to forgive his wife's accidental transgression. Plus of course, even in the minor roles, some little more than cameos by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson and others, there are eye-catching and memorable performances.And let's not forget the astute direction of Michael Curtiz, often regarded and indeed derided by some critics as a journeyman, contractual director, known as a reliable and efficient studio-man who got the job done in an unflashy way. Be that as it may, I know he's directed many Hollywood features which are favourites of mine and if ever a movie needed an unflashy treatment, it was this one.Curtiz knew that when it comes to great story-telling in celluloid, the fundamental things apply and that's why 'Casablanca' will be loved and revered, as time goes by.",9,1,1,2 January 2020
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," 101 dogs' lives
","Just last year, our family took on a pet dog for the first time so my perception of this Disney classic is obviously now biased. Seriously though, I'd have enjoyed it anyway. It's old fashioned family entertainment, easy to watch, but highly sentimental, of course. The animation was to my inexpert eyes, very good, particularly the tricky job of imparting personality to so any Dalmatian pups. Pongo and Hattie, the pups' parents could be Lady and the Tramp a bit further down the road while Cruella De Ville follows the models of preceding Disney female baddies, only with even more flounce and extravagance. Apart from the 'Cruella De Ville' song, there's a distinct lack of musical interludes, which serves the purposes of the one-long-chase plot-line reasonably well. There's gentle humour as you'd expect and a tolerable running gag with the little pup that's forever hungry. I thought the best sequence though was right at the start when Pongo persuaded his owner to cosy up to Mattie's in the park, but the narrative manages to engage all the way through with the 'human' characters also achieving sufficient degrees of personality to embellish the tale before the obligatory happy ending. You'd have to be pretty hard-hearted not to enjoy this delightful animation which I took pleasure in doing today for the very first time.",7,2,2,10 September 2011
Minority Report," Future imperfect
","With a typically imaginative future-set sci-fi story by Philip K Dick, an A-list cast with Tom Cruise in the lead and Steven Spielberg as director, this big-budget feature looks great on paper. The story's good too, in these days of zero-tolerance towards crime, the idea of stopping a murder before it's actually committed is ingenious and the demonstration of the Pre-Crime Unit in action, effectively the film's prologue, is great as Tom Cruise and his team race against the clock to stop a crime of passion double-murder.I also liked the fact that the operation was subject to moral and indeed legal scrutiny, in the form of government busybody Colin Farrell, but the main story, and the excuse for Cruise to do his running man schtick one more time is when the system inexplicably turns on him, triggering the obligatory extended chase and action sequences which for me take up too much of the story, spectacle over content. I didn't even think the SFX were that good, especially Cruise's John Anderton's gravity-defying first escape from his pursuers, plus the product-placement to which the viewer is subliminally subjected is outrageously excessive. In addition it was too easy to pick out the real bad guy and I even predicted, without 'pre-cog', the give-away line before it was said, making the ending somewhat predictable. There's not much call for great acting here, Cruise doing action-hero better than bereaved parent, Max Van Sydow, looking and sounding like John Huston, but without the devil-meant while Farrell probably comes off best, but is dispensed with too soon and somewhat unnecessarily I thought.I think that under all the flash-bang-wallop that Spielberg employs here there was a leaner, darker, better film trying to get out. Perhaps if he'd pre-cogged the final cut himself, he might not have blocked his own buster.",6,0,1,26 May 2013
Lifeboat," 6 Men, 3 women (and a baby) in a boat
","Rarely seen Hitchcock thriller which is well worth rooting out. People often forget just how experimental The Master could be and here he prefigures future exercises like the long takes of 'Rope' and 'Under Capricorn', the single fixed point setting for 'Rear Window' and the B & W shock-horror of 'Psycho' with a psychological drama set entirely at sea in a lifeboat. The difficulties of involving the audience with such a static setting are obvious but with a combination of an imaginative screenplay, first rate ensemble acting and of course Hitch's own masterly direction, this movie grips from start to finish. There are fewer than usual of the director's customary flourishes, instead we get that Hitchcock rarity, an actors' showcase, with fine performances coaxed from all aboard. The writing is subtle yet profound, making its point that the German enemy at large, (remember the film was made midway through the Second World War) isn't an obvious goose-stepping monster but instead a highly intelligent, multi-lingual, individual who for most of the movie deftly manipulates his co-passengers for his own ends. The film also makes telling points about the differing reactions of humans in an extreme situation in war-time but does so by avoiding obvious stereotyping and makes well its 'united we stand, divided we fall' message. With heavyweight writers like Steinbeck and an uncredited Ben Hecht contributing, the dialogue is gritty and realistic, even risqué at times and only occasionally guilty of big-word incomprehensibility. All the actors deserve praise for their natural acting, reacting on the whole truly to their desperate situation, despite being deluged with an ocean's worth of water. Talullah Bankhead in particular shines as we see her lose all her personal belongings right down to her Cartier bracelet and make-up at the film's conclusion. Only a few of the process shots jar as unrealistic with Hitch's shot selection on the whole correct and intuitive. Of course the film falters a little from the enforced inaction and episodic progress of the narrative but I was engrossed throughout by the taut direction and unravelling of the passengers' ethics and morals as their plight continues. Hardly grace under pressure!",7,1,1,31 December 2008
Chinatown," Jack and kill
","I have to confess I absolutely hate Jack Nicholson as an actor. Everyone has their bÃªte- noire I suppose and he's mine, I just see him overacting in everything instead of acting. That goes for 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 'The Shining', 'The Departed', you name it, for me he ruins it. All that is, except this. In Roman Polanski's superb revision of the 40's 'tec thriller, Nicholson is, and I really hate to say it, believe me, nothing short of brilliant. His character is a workaday private investigator, small-fry, but smart and persistent and Nicholson has you following in Jake Gittes every step from the first, which of course is director Polanski's methodology here, to draw in the viewer and hand us the problem, almost at first-hand, of trying to solve the labyrinthine plot, which gets deeper and darker as it progresses.Of course there has to be a femme fatale and here Faye Dunaway is entrusted the Mary Astor/Lauren Bacall role. However I wasn't completely convinced by her, for me she lacked the sexy allure and depths of mystery the part demands. Thus it was that at the famous expository 'Mother! Sister!' scene, I almost burst out laughing at the fake sincerity (or should that be sincere fakery?) she employs. It was John Huston who got the acting Oscar in the movie, well deserved for his sleazy portrayal of the monstrous megalomaniacal father to Dunaway.Polanski's stylish direction is pace-perfect, unhurriedly but assuredly unfolding and then folding in again the action. The cinematography and depiction of the age couldn't be more accurate at least to these eyes and ears while the rhythmic vernacular of the dialogue is a pleasure to hear. By the time the movie reaches its bloody, tragic, but inevitable climax, you feel like one of the bystanders shooed away by the police at the end, so close have you been to the action.At one point Gittes asks the question 'How do you like them apples?' I liked them fine, just fine.",8,2,3,1 December 2012
Rocketman," High Flying Bird
","Elton John the recording artist played a big part in my teenage soundtrack years, encompassing his acknowledged classic period from 1971-1976 so the music from this fantasy bio-pic certainly hits the spot with me. I've also seen him in concert more than once and can testify that he's a dynamite live performer. This film acknowledges both of these things but also seeks to portray Elton the human being, the repressed young gay man, born of difficult parents who discovers he has an innate talent for playing the piano and writing melodies for songs. Once he hooks up with his 'brown dirt cowboy' lyricist Bernie Taupin and after the two of them struggle for a few years as hack songwriters at the beck and call of old-fashioned impresario Dick James, Elton's alter ego, the flamboyant Captain Fantastic showman duly lands and makes him the biggest act in America covering those golden years.That success however came at a price as the lonely superstar, still struggling to come to terms with his sexuality and mind-blowing success, duly heads for the overload and binges out on drink, drugs and success. The film ends with the at last reformed John belting out his survival song 'I'm Still Standing' and exorcising most of his demons although if you've ever seen the subsequent infamous 'fly-on-the-wall' TV special 'Tantrums and Tiaras' he's obviously still a spendthrift and subject to mood swings.No saint is our Elton then but it is possible to feel understanding and even sympathy for the poor little mega-rich boy portrayed here. Director Dexter Fletcher is undoubtedly on John's side as evidenced by the timespan selected here, but still the film and its portrayal of superstar excess seemed a bit shallow and obvious to me.I liked the over-the-top introduction to the movie as Elton in full regalia crashes an A.A. meeting, at which his confessions and recollections director Fletcher conveniently uses to tell his rise and fall. Never mind that the time-line is frequently skewered and liberties are taken with the detail, the film is principally out to showcase John's extensive musical library and certainly does this although with sometimes mixed results.Taron Egerton doesn't really look or sound a lot like Elton but he wholeheartedly throws himself into the part and just about carries it off. Richard Madden gets a fairly meaty part as John Reid, Elton's cold, controlling manager and for a time, lover, Jamie Bell is okay as Bernie Taupin, but none of his great band get named in the movie and neither is any credit given to the producer of all his early records, Gus Dudgeon or his orchestrator Paul Buckmaster, which I thought somewhat remiss.Fletcher directs the musical numbers with some flair, occasionally adapting the song lyrics to fit the screenplay, but is less certain in depicting the dramatic episodes in the singer's life, which too often flirt with cliche.The film is certainly flash, brash and loud and Elton would probably admit that these adjectives accurately described him at the height of his success but trying to encompass so much into a mere two hour film, just too many short-cuts are taken with a different song to fit in every ten minutes or so, the characterisations, particularly Elton's, rarely run deep.Still, the film was a good reminder of his glory days and just how high-quality his music was at that time but unfortunately I got the sense that the Elton John here lived up more to his tabloid image than his real self.",5,4,8,13 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Fourth Time Around
","I've recently watched both the 1937 non-musical version of this well-worn riches-to-rags / rags to riches story which starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March and the first musical version with Judy Garland and James Mason from 1954 while the most recent Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristoffersson vehicle is also fairly strong in my memory. This version, directed by and starring Bradley Cooper as the ageing country-rock star whose career is about to hit the skids but who introduces current pop star Lady Gaga as the rising talent he accidentally runs into seems to very much be a remake of that Streisand showcase rather than the other two.Like Kristoffersson, he is a bearded, grizzled rocker, with a more rock-oriented name of Jackson rather than Norman Maine and more drunken, drug-addled episodes it seems than sober ones, who when we first see him is out of his face at an arena gig but just about holding it together. After the gig he crashes in a bar where it's of all things, drag night, but the one true female singer is part time barmaid Ally, played by Gaga who naturally wows the crowd and in particular Maine with her solo spot. So they hook up afterwards, he finds she writes her own songs and invites her to sing one of them as an encore at his next gig. As you'd expect, she goes over big, they become a couple afterwards and the whole cycle of her inexorable rise crossing with his inevitable fall drives the rest of the film.In all this and more, like the lovers' bath scene, it strongly resembles the 1976 version and obviously can't fail to include the bathetic scene where he drunkenly ruins her Grammy Award presentation night but makes a big mistake I feel in not ending on one of cinema's best ever finishing lines which served its three predecessors well enough, as here Gaga sings a heartfelt piano ballad he was working on before he died. I also missed the 'Mr Ally' jibe from the earlier films which helped fuel Maine's self-destruction, not that I was expecting a scene by scene remake but in omitting it don't feel it was replaced by anything substantial, certainly not the hackneyed relationship between Maine and his brother.Both leads are strong in their parts with Cooper displaying suitable rock star credentials and Gaga proving a natural, when speaking as well as singing her words. However, a fair bit of the dialogue fell on my ears as cliched and the songs themselves, though serviceable, don't scream out classic to me, certainly nothing to rival 'The Man That Got Away' or even 'Evergreen'.I know I keep returning to the three preceding versions but can't help myself and perhaps it would have been better if I hadn't seen them so recently. Anyway, to me it was about on a par with Streisand's version which ranks it below the first two versions. Wonder when the next remake will take place as it inevitably will?",6,3,6,13 January 2019
Gravity," Saving Scientist Ryan
","One of the biggest-grossing films of the year and one of RYM's highest-ranking movies (number 60 all-time, as I write) and it's only just come out. No shortage of expectation on my part then as I donned the 3D glasses and sat in for show-time.Well, I was disappointed. I can see it's a technical wonder with its depiction of life in space, both inside and outside a space- station, but frankly the lack of drama, never mind action very much bored me in my seat. It's very hard to convey character garbed in a space-suit, whirling around the cosmos, you can barely see the actors faces for the first hour or so. I found nothing greatly original in the very thin story-line either and some of the quirky character traits either overly sentimental (Bullock's loss of her young daughter) or just plain irritating (Clooney's country and western music predilection).I appreciate the difficulty of one solitary character carrying a film, but 'The Spirit Of St Louis' and 'The Old Man And The Sea' in their depictions of human-kind's battles against earlier frontiers managed it and while I liked that it was a woman rather than a man who carried the film, Sandra Bullock is no James Stewart or Spencer Tracy. I'm no expert in these things, but her ability to successfully navigate her weightless way around the spacecrafts of two foreign countries and just by picking up conveniently situated manuals, actually fly the things and engineer her escape to miraculously land on water, yards from shore, all beggared belief.Watching this film was like sitting in a theme-park simulator, okay for 10 but certainly not for 90 whole minutes.",4,3,6,24 November 2013
To Be or Not to Be," Benny good, man!
","This is a quite brilliant Ernst Lubitsch film which manages to skilfully combine wartime dramatic pathos with wonderfully barbed humour, without doing so in an overtly propaganda-laden way. Set in Warsaw, just before and then during the initial German occupation which itself triggered World War 2, it starts in a relatively light-hearted manner as we're introduced to an acting troupe headed by husband and wife team Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, he the hammish, self-confident leading man, she the toy-boy-chasing leading lady. When the group's latest production, topically called 'Gestapo' is closed down for fear of reprisals by the fearful authorities, they and their company join the local resistance. Amongst the rest of the cast are two spear-carrying extras who each dream of bigger parts, one who recites Shylock's 'If you prick me do I not bleed' speech any chance he can, the other convinced he could pass for Hitler to the general public. When these foibles are adroitly woven into the plot at a climactic stage later in the film you appreciate how well written and crafted the movie is.I've never seen Jack Benny in any other feature and only know him for his deadpan humour on American TV much later than this but he's great here as the cuckolded husband pressed into action by the Polish resistance, struggling to balance his personal life with the National Good. His timing is spot-on and really you have to wonder why movies didn't also become his medium the way they did for say Bob Hope, but if this is his one major film role, then it's certainly a memorable one. Lombard I've sometimes not appreciated in some of her other roles but she's delightful here, coquettish, but clever with it.The film shows the Polish resistance running rings round their German occupiers and also lampoons Hitler in bold fashion which surely wouldn't have been lost on wartime viewers. I loved the interwoven plotting as well as the frequent laugh-out-loud gags - right from the first humorous 'Heil Myself' to the last 'To Be Or Not To Be' running gag. There are only a couple of misfiring jokes like when Lombard complicity moans 'Heil Hitler' when receiving a kiss from the Polish traitor or the too obvious 'Friends, Romans and countrymen' line from Benny but there are far more hits than misses for sure.For me this film could have worked as a drama without the comedy and as a comedy without the drama. That's how strong both elements are here and yet put them together as well as Lubitsch does here and you have something special.About that there is no question.",8,5,11,29 December 2018
Star Trek," Start trek
","I'm a first generation 'Star Trek' fan without being a Trekkie, in fact Patrick Stewart is probably my favourite captain of the Enterprise, the heresy of it, but following in the recent example of the James Bond if not Star Wars franchise, it pays to go back to the start for a fresh beginning.Naturally therefore there's a good deal of pleasure to be had in watching familiar faces pop up as the story progresses as well as familiar phrases and even surroundings and devices, spruced up with SFX and CGEN for modern consumption. There's attention to detail in continuity,for instance the original ship's Captain Pike ending up in a wheelchair recalling the TV pilot episode 'The Cage' (okay maybe I am a Trekkie, after all) but are some neat narrative twists too, with young Kirk's pursuit of young Uhura pipped by her having the hots for Spock of all people. The latter-day facsimiles are all fairly with the exception of Simon Pegg's unrecognisable take on Scotty although I guess the casting stays true to the original series in casting anyone but a native Scot to play one of my countrymen.The story is complicated yet direct enough to engage and hold interest throughout, even if Eric Bana's villain Nero probably isn't quite malevolent enough. As ever there's a race against time to save the earth and a bizarre meeting of past and future Spocks before the natural order is restored of Kirk as captain and Spock as first officer. The action scenes are terrific with hosts of daredevil stunts and there's loads of falling masonry and collapsing planets to feast the eyes on.Important as these are, the heart of the story is the Kirk / Spock friendship, born in enmity as these things frequently are, as well as the building of the team which would later helm the bridge in future missions to come. All in all, there's not much to fault here, the resurrection obviously being carried out by admirers of the TV prototype. The sentimentalist in me might have liked to see a few more cameos from some of the surviving cast members, rather than the one rather large part given to a very old and slightly frail Leonard Nimoy, good as it is to see him.Just a shame to think it'll probably be another year or two for a sequel to arrive, when in the old days all you had to do was wait until next week for the next episode...",8,1,5,24 February 2011
Citizen Kane," Kane and Very Able
","What can you do with a monument like Kane? Well, all I think you can do is just walk around it admiringly, time and again, because undoubtedly you'll see or hear something you've missed before which, at least if you're me, will only deepen your appreciation of Welles's breathtaking daring and genius in bringing it to the screen as his debut feature. Just consider that, his first film.Of course it's no one-man show, as he has help from numerous gifted collaborators on the movie, from screenwriter Joseph L Mankiewicz's brilliant screenplay, to Gregg Toland's yardstick-setting cinematography, to Bernard Herrman's completely simpatico soundtrack plus of course Welles's own troupe of Mercury Theatre players who bring it to life.But it's still unmistakably Welles's film from his frequently inspired direction, razor-sharp dialogue contributions and of course his tour-de-force acting performance in the title role. Probably the most dissected, on a scene-by-scene basis, movie ever made, even watching it today you still get the sense of risk involved in the enterprise, from its novel way with even the titles sequence, the dissolves between scenes to suggest the passage of time, low-angle camera set-ups scoping enclosed rooms, ceilings included, the expressionistic lighting, the monumental interiors, the overlapping dialogue, I think I'll stop there or I'll end up running away with myself.It helps that the story at its heart is so involving and of course credible if you do the read-across from the real life near contemporary William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies relationship to Kane and Susan although I rather believe Welles's frequently made assertions that it wasn't just based on them. The film just bursts with great lines, dramatic situations and memorable scenes far, far too many to mention, in fact the only real weakness I can discern is that identified by Welles himself in later interviews as the dollar-book Freud pursuit of Kane's enigmatic dying utterance 'Rosebud'. It just wasn't necessary to add this layer of sentimental mystique to the film.Otherwise, feel free to watch this movie any way you like, whether as a technical study in camerawork and set-design, as a scabrous attack on the graft-dominated policies of turn of the century American politics, a biopic of a great but deeply flawed man or even as a tragic, misbegotten love story. All the supporting cast are great in Welles's own considerable shadow, but if pushed I think I'd have to give a special best-of-the-rest mention to Dorothy Comingore as the hapless Susan.It works on all the above levels but most of all it rightly stands as the apex, at that time at least, of what Hollywood cinema could achieve. Some would say it still holds that position today and I think I would struggle myself to put the case against it.As the poster itself says, people will still be talking about it so long as pictures are made.",9,0,0,30 December 2019
The Maze Runner," Circle game
","I normally watch these 'Young Adult' adventure movies when child-minding my almost- teenage niece Erin and so, having previously watched the first two 'Hunger Games' films with her at my side, she unsurprisingly recommended this film for us to watch on her most recent stay. It undoubtedly helped that I'd thus already been initiated into the whole bleak post- apocalyptic vision-thing as yet again the focus is on a group of youngsters forced to deal with a seemingly no-win scenario imposed on them by adults which sees them out in the wilds confronted this time by a monster-maze which offers their only escape although it comes, naturally with its patrolling nightmarish killer-creatures the Grievers to provide the expected SFX fight sequences.Unlike 'The Hunger Games' where the plot exposition is made clear from the start, the twist here is that the viewer is thrown into the middle of the action just like the initially amnesiac kids with the purpose of their task only explained at the very end, just handily in time to trail the inevitable part two (Erin tells me there are four books in the series so I'm guessing quadrilogy here).I understand the movie was pitched by its producers as 'Lord Of The Flies' meets 'Lost' which neatly sums up the plot. The young actors playing the leads are all unknown to me which I think helps with the credibility of the narrative. To me it seemed as if the delayed entrance of the young girl to the group seemed more like a device to broaden the movie's appeal across the sexes (there were no girls in 'Lord Of The Flies') but even after she arrives she doesn't seem to contribute much but maybe she gets her 'Catniss' awakening further down the line.I was perhaps most impressed with the maze structure itself, a massive hulking monumental construct full of dark foreboding and the child in me was naturally pleased when the gang finally got to the end, although not before the rather predictable leadership conflict in the group and various scrapes and scares with the marauding Grievers.Relatively unsentimental, action-packed and with just enough depth of character throughout, I again found myself quite happily sitting through another film I'd not normally have opted into. Whether I ever watch any others in the series will probably depend on my future availability as a 'baby-sitter', although on the strength of this I might just volunteer my services when the opportunity arises.",6,1,2,3 January 2015
Memento," Memento more!
","Christopher Nolan's breakthrough film displays in full his originality in choice of subject and bravura style. 'Memento' starts and ends with different murders (or does it?), keeping the viewer engrossed and always on the hop with its forward and backward time-frames, not to mention contrasting colour and monochromatic cinematography.Brilliantly edited and skilfully acted the film demands complete attention from first to last, or is that last to first, as Guy Pearce's haunted Lenny tries to rebuild his memories and uncover the truth about the rape and murder of his wife. The jump-cuts each time he goes back further in his flashbacks jolt like one waking from a dream and yet build a rhythm to the movie which takes away the viewer's initial expectations as to when his next recurrence will crop up. Just occasionally the disparate characters and the interlocking story lost me and I'm not completely sure I got the ending but up until that point I was in thrall for most of the time as Nolan presents us with a brilliant twist on film noir, as Pearce's insurance investigator (acting for all the world like a private investigator) finds himself embroiled in a convoluted murder mystery. Pearce is excellent in the lead, but the rest of the cast are excellent in support in what I imagine must have been a confusing shoot. After a run of excellent original thrillers in the late 80's 'The Usual Suspects', 'LA Confidential' 'Se7en', 'The Silence Of The Lambs', it was going to take something very good to continue the new tradition.For the most part however Nolan delivers and as his subsequent track record shows, it was no fluke",8,0,2,5 August 2012
Amistad," Ship of shame...
","One of Spielberg's 'big subject' features (c.f. 'Schindler's List'), dramatising the epic story of the slave-revolt on a Spanish ship circa 1840, which winds up in the waters and therefore the territory of a young United States, causing a legal battle ostensibly on the rights of slaves and of course prefiguring the Civil WAr that followed within a generation.One thing Spielberg can relied to deliver is an arresting start to a film, witness 'Savings Private Adams' for one, and here he may even surpassed the celebrated drama of the latter with the initial violent and bloody uprising of the African slaves, shot in a howling storm at dead of night, brilliantly lit and utterly convincing in its depiction of their do or die struggle. Later on, in the film-within-a-film flashback showing the Mende people's capture and incarceration in the slave fortress and then the Transatlantic slave ship, he similarly doesn't stint on the unimaginable horror of their experience, with scenes which will make the viewer wince with pain or shame at so-called civilised man's butchery of fellow humans they believed were beneath them. So far so effective. Naturally the film has to deal at length with the protracted legal arguments over the slaves human rights, which proves trickier to deliver, especially as their initial victory was appealed, apparently to appease the slave-owning south, to the Supreme Court by the office of the President - the problem arising as to how to effectively deliver a second courtroom drama. I suspect some dramatic licence was taken here, although I can't be sure without reading more on the historic account of the case.Therefore I did have some issues with aspects of the direction. These include the rather obvious way that Anthony Hopkins' former President John Quincy Adams is introduced so early into the piece (even without knowing the facts, you just know he's eventually going to take the case and deliver the big speech which will win the day). Plus Spielberg just can't resist the easy lure of sentimentality as he gives us a close-up on the beautiful, innocent face of an infant on board the Slave-boat. Finally, there's the distraction of the almost ever-present background music of John Williams, fawning over every scene like an unwelcome attendant.I also have issues with some of the casting, Matthew McConaughey really lacking gravitas as the slaves' lawyer and apart from giving us a lot of facial reactions and one clumsy flashback to his own slavery days on board the slave-ship, I've little idea why Morgan Freeman is on board, if you'll pardon the pun. Hopkins delivers his big speech assuredly but you never feel you're watching a major historical character at a defining time in his life. The actors playing the slaves are however convincing, it helping that they were less familiar than some if the big names in key roles elsewhere.There's undoubtedly a major story here and cinematographically the film is marvellous. I was less convinced however by some of the turns of the narrative and some of the acting. A film with good intentions and high aspirations let down by some of the familiar indulgences of its director.",6,0,3,21 March 2011
Coraline," Sweet Coraline
","In the wake of all the recent PIXAR family-friendly, uplifting animated entertainments, this was a refreshingly welcome alternative fairy-tale of an altogether darker hue. The eponymous heroine is a commonplace teenager, uprooted from friends of her own age, struggling to have her preoccupied parents pay her much notice. Worse, she has no pets, their new house is a cold, bare, uninteresting apartment in the middle of nowhere with only quirky neighbours, like the two middle-aged sisters and a Russian acrobat, all seeking an outlet or their 'talents' in a carnival show or circus. Only a talkative young boy and his mysterious cat offer her any outlet for her wish for recognition and adventure, until, that is the boy brings her a doll which is her own image, only with buttons for eyes and she next stumbles across a secret door which provides her with a gateway to a brighter world where her 'other' parents have more personality and more importantly time for her too. But things get stranger and darker with every midnight visit she makes to the 'otherworld'...Unlike other fairy stories, even the darker ones, this one takes frequent detours away from the narrative to introduce the supporting characters, usually in surreal situations. In this it chimes in with the unnatural but vivid world we enter in our dreams and nightmares. There are mixed-up elements present of classic stories gone by, most obviously 'Alice In Wonderland', 'The Wizard of Oz', the 'Narnia' tales and others while the animation recalls the work of Terry Gilliam and artists like Salvador Dali and the darker imaginings of Van Gogh, but there's an originality at work too which is refreshing and entertaining.The music too is original and sympathetic to the production and even if the story does end up at the required happy ending, it doesn't get there the most obvious way, taking in a Harry Potter type quest to get there.The animation itself is excellent with many noteworthy sequences, transitions and backgrounds. Perhaps lacking a little of the wit and knowing humour of the best PIXAR films, this feature nevertheless shows that there is life in animation outside of Shrek, Toy Story et al.",7,0,0,17 June 2012
Iron Man 2," Rust never sleeps
","Another flash-bang-wallop of a Marvel feature in the now continuing saga of Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man, this is equally as exhilarating as its predecessor. The suit is still the star for me, my main objection being that old metal-head's screen-time is reduced greatly by the increasing focus on the troubled Tony Stark, who besides a worsening poisoned-blood situation (caused by his palladium-based artificial heart) which threatens to kill him, suffers rock-star excess, over-drinking, the approbation of colleagues and lovers, the chiding of S.H.I.E.L.D recruiting officer Nick Fury, disputes with a confrontational congressman, continuing rivalry with smooth operating megalomaniac Justin Hammer, oh and daddy didn't love him either - all of that before Mickey Rourke's Whiplash enters the scene.So, quite a lot going on then, which with so much character development, gives the likes of Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Sam Rockwell (the latter, the real show-stealer here) the chance to act and interact, although Don Cheadle seems very ill at ease as pressed-into-action hero-or-villain War Machine and Rourke gets to mumble and mutter a lot in a heavy Russian accent. Scarlett Johanssen, provides energy and sexiness as martial arts expert Black Widow, obviously laying down a marker for the Avengers movie to come.The action sequences are a little hit and miss for me, the first fight between Iron Man and Whiplash being the most memorable, but the later flight / fight with Whiplash's drones is all just lights in the sky and the final reckoning with Whiplash over and done with too quickly. Punctuated by a mainly heavy-metal (geddit?) soundtrack, this is one film you won't be easily able to ignore. How long it actually lives in the memory is a different matter entirely, sort of like reading a comic-book I guess.",7,2,4,26 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Still hungry
","I was corralled into watching this movie by my visiting 11 year-old niece, who'd already seen it twice before and of course couldn't help herself giving me prior notice of key moments usually just a few minutes before they occurred on screen. That said, she also helped explain some of the vagaries of the plot and characterisations as the movie progressed, making it a quid-pro-quo so far as I was concerned.What I got from my viewing was a sort of near-future version of 'Lord Of The Flies' crossed with 'Big Brother' (referencing both the TV reality show and of course Orwell's novel). It is a bit slow to get going, as the characters are introduced to the viewer, then stays in low gear once the young sacrificial lambs are selected for training before some excitement is generated in the 'last man standing' last hour battle-royal between the combatants. Actually this section reminded me of nothing so much as a classic episode of the original 'Star Trek' where Captain Kirk is marooned on a strange planet to fight a one-to-one battle with an alien opponent.To be honest, there was a bit more action and drama in James T's adventure than the youngsters' here. Each time a major crisis was averted, a new one would manifest itself, computer-game style, usually created by the games-masters conjuring up new perils at will for the young hero and heroine to fight. The young actors playing the main parts to me didn't seem especially memorable although in a screenplay where they mostly get to run and fall down a lot, perhaps I'm doing them a disservice. There's not really much depth in the portrayals from the older actors too, Woody Harrellson getting to play 'larger-than-life' as the youngsters' grumpy, soused mentor although of course he's won over to their side quickly and easily enough, while Stanley Tucci gets to ham it up almost as outrageously as he did in 'The Devil Wears Prada' as a TV show interviewer.I guess it was hard for this movie to fail commercially given the literary following amongst teenagers the source novel has attracted in a similar way to the Harry Potter films. I personally prefer films of this type to be more fantasy and less ferocious, (some of the on-screen violence must have been border-line excessive with the censors) and about 40 or so minutes could easily have been edited down to make a tighter, more coherent and satisfying movie, but I've certainly seen many worse 'teenagers' -type movies, although unless young Erin is really stuck for company, I'll not be queueing up to see the sequel any time soon.",5,1,3,9 November 2013
The Impossible," Underwhelming production of overwhelming tragedy
","I'm sorry, I understand this movie is based on the remarkable true story of a family's heroism in the wake of the devastating tsunami which hit Thailand (and other countries) on Boxing Day 2004, killing thousands, but I just wasn't moved by what I saw on the screen.Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are barely together on screen long enough to project for the viewer any kind of meaningful relationship between them, their family of three young boys act stiltedly and unnaturally, while the dialogue is clichéd, ditto the dramatic sequences, the latter on innumerable occasions. The director isn't above cross-cutting between scenes at key moments for dramatic effect, a Hollywood M.O. from the year dot, but the manipulation here is so blatant and ham-fisted that the film somehow failed to draw me into the human drama here.The special effects for the tsunami and Watts and her oldest boy's subsequent odyssey in the aftermath of the disaster, I found only passable, at best while McGregor's acting in particular leaves a lot to be desired, being shallow and showy by turns. Watts has less to do, being wrapped up badly injured in a hospital bed for a large part of the running time, in fact any number of the extras were more watchable in my opinion.While I have nothing but admiration for the real-life family who somehow came through such a terrible ordeal, this formulaic, clichéd disaster movie didn't, I think, serve them well and rather ill-served its noble subject.",3,8,18,15 October 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Dead men and women walking.
","Very funny Pegg and Frost vehicle spoofing zombie films actually quite a long time before the whole 'Twilight' thing got underway not to mention the sub-genre of historical characters like Abraham Lincoln combating the undead when not fighting a civil war and abolishing slavery.If anything, I found there were probably too many zombies on display leading to lots of time taken up battering, skewering and shooting hordes of them, which to my mind got in the way a little of the very funny humour elsewhere. Sure Frost and Pegg are just another set of men behaving badly, Frost the lazy, slobbish leech and Pegg the bright, blokey nerd but they play off each other so well that I'll forgive the stereotypes.The gags come thick and fast, with running-gags a-plenty ('You've got red on you', 'I'm sorry, Shaun' and more), sight and slapstick-gags and lots of local humour to relate to, especially if you're born in the UK. I found very few of the jokes obviously telegraphed, instead finding the humour and general observation both fresh and funny. My favourite gag, probably the deciding of which records to aim at the zombies - 'Purple Rain' - No, 'Sign Of The Times' - definitely not, 'Batman' soundtrack - send it!Director Edgar Wright does so briskly, especially with those now familiar fast-cut edits to speed along a scene or a joke. There's good support by all, but principally from Bill Nighy as Shaun's stand-offish step-dad and Lucy Smith as Shaun's girlfriend's girl-friend.All in all, just a very funny, if fake-gore-loving comedy, which rather like the zombies in the movie, I'd happily jump back up again to re-watch any future chance I get.",8,0,4,8 April 2015
Argo," Captive audience
","Truth really is stranger than fiction. Really, if the remarkable events depicted in this film hadn't been declassified by President Bill Clinton and instead pitched as a movie itself, it would surely never have gotten off the ground. Sometimes though, a story is so good that it doesn't need the Hollywood treatment and while I admit I was completely caught up in the drama of the six Iranian hostages that got away (in more senses than one), I felt at times manipulated by the what seemed at times artificial ratcheting up of the pressure as the group, led by sole CIA man played by director Ben Affleck edged ever closer to freedom. For a film that tries so hard for the authentic documentary feel, I just doubted if their escape was just so last-minute with their would-be fundamentalist captors learning if their true identities just as they were actually boarding the plane and then were chased down the runway by pursuing police cars and trucks.This grandstanding detracted from my enjoyment as for me there was more tension in the scenes where up-till-then reluctant unbeliever in Affleck's plan, Bryan Cranston has to improvise storyboardjng the imaginary movie under the scrutiny of gun-toting revolutionary soldiers smelling a rat, or the interminable wait before John Goodman's back-home movie producer picks up a call which again is make or break for the would-be escapees.With its mix of original news-clips of the day and edgy hand-held shots staged today, I was certainly taken back to the dark days of the long-lasting original crisis. Affleck, behind a nostalgically thick beard last seen on Al Pacino in 'Serpico', also didn't quite convince me as the cool pragmatic agent who imperils his own life to attempt to get the six out. On the plus side though Alan Arkin and John Goodman are both fine as the behind-the-scenes Hollywood schemers trying to make the back story look real.Although I found the direction a little too busy at times, I fully understand the likely attempt to recreate the chaos in Tehran and the desperation in Washington to provide a solution, any solution to the situation. I was amazed at the way the Iranian revolutionaries put young children to work to establish the existence of the six refugees (the moral of the story, always use a criss-cross shredder) and likewise shocked at the sight of a suited businessman hanging by a noose from a construction crane in the middle of what otherwise looks like any other city centre in the world.Images like those stay long in the memory as does much of this revelatory film which in my opinion just overdid the climax to what is a compelling and blood-thumping story.",7,0,1,28 February 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Fading star
","What I found interesting about this second entry in the relaunch of 'Star Trek' with the original characters is that it seemed to take us up right to the start of the original TV series, indicating to me that there may be nowhere further for the adventure to go. Of course I'll be proved wrong, but I did find this latest exercise in reheating an old soufflé somewhat unsatisfying.There seemed to be little new here either in terms of characterisation or plot development and for me anyway the appeal of recognising young actors playing their antecedents didn't work a second time. Familiarity breeds contempt as we get the same callow, randy young Kirk from the film before, likewise the crusty, loyal McCoy, mischievous but half-demented Scotty and of course the brave but emotionless Spock. Benedict 'Sherlock' Cumberbatch is introduced as Khan and while he brings an angular physicality to the part, he lacks the scheming exoticism of Ricardo Montalban's original. While I liked some of the fidelity shown to previous story-lines, in particular the reversal of the dying Kirk with a helpless Spock on the outside contrasting the 'Wrath of Khan' climax, I just don't get the Spock / Uhuru pairing at all or the reinvention of Kirk's mentor Christopher Pike when we Trekkies know he lived to escape 'The Cage' rather than meet his end here.Unsurprisingly and disappointingly too, there's some eye candy for the boys thrown in, in the form of the Admiral's pretty blonde daughter who inveigles herself on board and pretty soon afterwards discards her clothes, just to confirm who the real target audience is here. And really, Leonard Nimoy's cameos are becoming as irritating as Stan Lee's in every Marvel movie made.The effects are fine if a bit much at times. The never-ending climactic fight between Khan and Spock seemed unoriginal too with both combatants naturally surviving murderous attacks on the other ad infinitum.I think I've come to the conclusion that this reincarnation of the old Enterprise crew just maybe isn't for me, just as it didn't for 'Star Wars'. These are great characters but the main reason I identify with them is through the original actors and actually consider these lightweight re-interpretations to be no real substitute. The thing is these kids are going where others have gone before and better. Time to beam me up, Scotty!",4,2,4,9 March 2014
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Four Go To Narnia...
","I enjoy classic children's literature almost as much as the grown-up stuff and have read C S Lewis' full Chronicles of Narnia, although not for many years. Still, did this latest blockbuster adaptation thrill me as the book did...certainly it did.The story is initially quite slow-paced, obviously laying out the children's characters and attempting to individualise their traits for the viewer until Lucy accidentally backs into Narnia and things as would expect pick up from there. It's a pity that the movie was made in the wake of the 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord Of The Rings' series, where little people / children also encounter magic, talking animals and have to face up and face down the forces of evil in a foreign land, so that some of the scenes and situations seem a little second-hand to viewers, like me, of the others.So maybe, with their lack of familiarity, that's why the four children here seem a little stiff an strange in their attitudes, whilst remembering all the time that kids were very different and had different outlooks 70 odd years ago. The acting of the children is perfectly acceptable but I just didn't feel they any of them made a lasting impression in at least this viewer's memory, with the possible exception of the young girl playing Lucy.As you would expect, the anonymity of the children in the leads is compensated, like in Potter, by having big-name British character actors in the more substantial supporting roles. These include a quite scrawny looking Tilda Swinton as the wicked witch, the dependable Jim Broadbent as the aged, knowing owner of the house which contains the magic wardrobe and, rather oddly, young hot-shot James McAvoy as the impish faun Mr Tumnus who darts in and out of the story.The special effects are very good on the whole in the scenic depiction of Narnia and its inhabitants bar one or two obvious matte background shots and the C-Gen grand battle at the end is convincingly done if perhaps not up to Peter Jackson standards. That's a great weapon old Tilda has, by the way! All the talking animals are well rendered too both in movement and of course speech synchronisation.As I said above, it's a shame that the Narnia adaptation didn't get green-lighted before Potter as I think there's better story-telling afoot here but this big-budget feature has managed to spawn, if belatedly, to date two successors.

","Another enjoyable if hardly essential Pixar animated feature, centring on two converging stories of animals escaping from the confines of Central Park Zoo for what they hope will be the long-denied freedom of life in the wild. Story one, the more dominant of the two, involves a lion, zebra, hippo and giraffe while the lesser tale concerns a hapless group of penguins desperate to get to the Antarctic.We get two contrasting outcomes to their respective quests, but with a predictably happy outcome as the usual mix of music, humour and high-quality graphics make for a light and easy watch.I must admit that for me the familiarity of some of the lead voices, particularly Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer, takes away from the 'personality' of their characters while Chris Rock as Marty is just too close to Eddie Murphy's Donkey in the 'Shrek' franchise.I also found the story lacking somewhat in conviction, centring too much on Alex the Lion's predilection for 'going native' and some of the minor characters just too cute for comfort. But overall, with plenty to entertain the kids and some decent gags for grown-ups, this is another happy entertainment worth lashing out for a family concessionary ticket, I'd have said.",6,0,0,27 May 2013
The Irishman," A Farewell To Arms
","I'm reasonably familiar with Frank Sheeran's story having some time ago read the book on which it was based. I suppose if anyone was ever going to film it, it would have to be Scorsese. He assembles his age-no-object three acting principals De Niro, Pacino and Pesci, using the new de-ageing technology to literally take years off their physical appearance and once you stop looking for the join in this, it's possible to settle down and enjoy this engrossing movie centring on Sheeran's life which saw him become the New York Mafia's main hit-man and along the way become the friend and confidante of the powerful but controversial Teamsters Union leader Jimmy Hoffa, whose sudden disappearance and almost certain murder in 1975 makes for the inevitable climax to proceedings here.At three and a half hours long, I don't mind admitting it took me two nights to get through it, but Sheeran had a long life living and killing and it was never likely that Scorsese was going to telescope it into a two hour film.Scorsese of course has made some of the most iconic gangster movies of the last forty years usually with DeNiro and Pesci on board and clearly this is his goodbye to the genre for which he'll principally be remembered. That obviously also goes for DeNiro and Pesci too, as well of course for Pacino who's certainly added to the genre in his long career too.The framing device for the narrative is an innocuous-seeming journey involving DeNiro's Sheeran and Pesci's Russell Bufalino characters taking a long drive to Detroit with their wives, the true purpose of which starts to become obvious as they progress. Through a series of intermittent flashbacks we get to see the story of Sheeran's recruitment as the Mafia's assassin, his rise up the ranks and along the way his introduction to Hoffa. There's a long epilogue where we see all the gangster bosses still living, Scorsese with subtitles having handily told us the date and usually violent means of death of the ones who didn't get that far, only by then they're all finally incarcerated and by the very end so aged and infirm that you wonder at the power and fear they once exerted.Which of course is pretty much the point of the film. These dealers in death will themselves be reduced to ashes and for all their attempts to make peace with their God, you have to wonder at their minuscule chance of redemption in the next world, if there is one.All of the big three do their bit to carry the load of the movie. De Niro as Sheeran is the blue, or should that be congealed blood biding the narrative together, Pacino largely reins in his sometimes hoo-hah acting style for who is the biggest character in the film while Pesci for me steals the accolades with a performance of almost avuncular menace in his part. It's significant that Sheeran's oldest daughter all through her growing life never takes to Pesci's Bufalino character as if even as a child she can sense the malevolence behind his kindly old man facade. Instead she and Hoffa become firm friends making the point that behind all his criminal abuse of power, he never killed or ordered the killing of anyone. The film is otherwise noticeable however for the almost invisibility of women in this man's, man's, man's world of criminal activity cloaked by a veneer of respectability.I found Scorcese's direction to be commendably non-flashy with mostly conventional set-ups concentrating a lot on the faces of his actors. The period recreations of time and place are meticulous and authentic. I would however have liked to have seen more evidence of the background criminality as at times it just seems to be all about hierarchical or territorial jostling at the end of a gun, when behind it all fuelling the ill-gotten gains lurked prostitution, gun-running, drugs, protection and trafficking no doubt amongst many others.I haven't always been a fan of Scorcese's big budget gang films like 'The Departed' or 'Gangs Of New York' but this one works for me as it seems less exaggerated in focus and is at pains not to glamorise these still despicable old-school gangsters.
If it's to be his farewell to mob life, while it's certainly a long and largely unsympathetic one.",8,1,4,6 January 2020
The Fifth Element," Five alive
","I like my science fiction but this film was just so out there I didn't know what to make of it in the end. It started off a bit like '2001' with the future ominously impinging on the recent past but started to lose me the minute hulking aliens which looked like St Bernard dogs who'd been too long in the rain arrived on the scene to attempt to steal the secret of the mysterious fifth element. Along the way they make an uneasy alliance with intergalactic master-criminal Zorg played by Gary Oldman and threaten the world with an Armageddon-type peril. Lucky for us all then that maverick retired space-captain Bruce Willis is in hand to save the world, just like he would in 'Armageddon' a few years later too.The plotting, characterisations and cinematography are so wacky that you really do wonder what colour the snow is in director Luc Bresson's world, although at a guess I'd say orange. Willis gets involved when the newly but fully born Mira Sarvoni, literally what the world was waiting for, drops in on him when he's riding around in his air-taxi. Before too long, Willis is heading off to a far flung planet to try and get his hands on the four precious jewels which apparently are the keys to the universe before Oldman does.Along the way he encounters a transsexual dee-jay / reality TV host, a hermaphrodite disco-opera singer and a veteran priest but unsurprisingly it takes a combination of fire- power and stunt work to save the day in spectacular beat-the-clock fashion and wouldn't you know, he gets the girl too.While I was never bored watching it, I'm not sure I was ever fully engaged by it, its weird combination of campness and thrills just not quite working for me. Willis is his usual laconic self, Oldman goes for Ming the Merciless but comes off unintentionally as Dr Evil while Sorvino is just awkward and ultimately sex-less as the infant-savage with her shock of red hair and prototype mankini outfit. Some of the scenes were literally eye-popping, like the first sighting of the air-traffic in the future New York and the explosive gun-fight at the climax but as a film it just didn't hold together enough for me. If the future really is this bright I should have worn shades.",5,1,4,2 November 2015
Black Book," Bloody Mata Hari
","Entertainment over verite? 'The Guns of Navarone' over 'Schindler's List'? How do you like your War? I'm in the latter camp which is probably why I was so disappointed in this breathless big-money epic. The introductory legend of the movie would have us believe this is all based on a true story but what we get instead is a cliché-ridden action-packed screen-fest which to my eyes and ears seriously fails its serious subject matter. There is in the plot I believe, a taut story to be told of the different reactions of a population to military occupation, between collaborators and resistance but nothing gets in the way of the director's juggernaut vision of shoot-'em-up violence, gratuitous nudity and a plot with so many twists and turns it threatens to bore a hole in the floor. We get not one but two traitors in the midst of the resistance fighters and for good measure the most miraculous recovery from an overdose of insulin this side of Lazarus. The actors try hard and there's no denying that Carice Van Houten is strikingly attractive and resourceful in the lead part. But all in all, they're combating hackneyed stereotypical roles and in the main fail to overcome the limitations of the writing. Paul Voerhaven has seemed to me in the past to be more style over content. On this occasion he's got too much content to play with and instead crams his film so that the end product looks like a number of TV episodes badly edited together to make a disappointing whole. Oh for some calmness at the centre of this particular maelstrom...",3,3,9,13 January 2008
Pirate Radio," That sinking feeling
","This is Richard Curtis's love-letter to the pirate radio ships that did so much to promote pop and rock music in the UK in the mid-60's, under the noses of the Establishment before being outlawed by the government in 1967 with the creation of the pop-oriented BBC Radio 1. I'm just a little too young to be aware of the impact of the pirates at the time although I've heard the odd nostalgic radio documentary retelling the story and to be absolutely honest, that medium probably served the story better as the subject does not justify a two hour plus movie like this.Actually the more I think about it, with its obvious references to the actual disc-jockeys (who all washed away their rebellious principles by signing up to the BBC en-masse and thus became familiar to the wider public, yours truly included), you have to wonder about the moral compass of a movie that lionises anodyne jocks like Tony Blackburn, Dave Lee Travis, Bob Harris, Stuart Henry and others. Even the inclusion of a miscast Philip Seymour-Hoffman revisiting, presumably, American renegade Emperor Rosko doesn't help the movie float (sorry) and a mock-grandiose conclusion, where yet again Curtis rallies all his cast and a horde of extras for the grandstand finish, only heightens the shortcomings.Women are treated as mere chattels, fame-obsessed fans desperate to sleep with their medium-wave heroes at the drop of a light-switch, but of course being politically correct a token black guy finds himself on board, alongside a lesbian tea-maid, who even manages to score with a pretty lesbian fan herself.The comedic scenes are telegraphed in from Carry On Doctor At Sea, plus I doubt a four-letter word was ever broadcast on-air as is made out here. Even the music is all over the place, many of the songs actually hailing from 1968, ('Jumping Jack Flash', 'Fire' for example, while The Who's 'Won't Get Fooled Again' is from 1971) the year after the pirates closed down, while the lack of any songs by The Beatles, the major movers of the times has to be a mistake too. The only thing that made me smile was the Python-like recreation of Jimi Hendrix's notorious 'Electric Ladyland' album-sleeve (again from 1968 however, pop-pickers!), albeit with a bevy of naked women in tow.In fact the best and most rebellious thing about the film was the soundtrack, a reminder of just how tumultuously wonderful the British music scene was at the time. Buy the soundtrack album if there is one and leave this tame comedic romp at the bottom of the sea where the pirate ship eventually settles by the end.",3,19,36,9 May 2010
Batman Returns," Neither fish nor...
","I really enjoyed Tim Burton's first tip at Batman and felt he'd found a good actor for the lead, Michael Keaton as well of course as a highly individual and laudably retro- representation of the dark and monolithic Gotham City, making it almost a character in itself and thus easy to accept the grotesque and deranged characters which emerge from the gloom to take on the blacker-than-black hero. Here though, I felt that too much was not enough as we get two villains for the price of one, as The Penguin and Catwoman make their bows in Batman's rogues gallery meaning we get two origin stories, a changing shift of perspective and of course two big (or is that one?) deaths at the end. I can't fault the acting - as I said earlier, I like Keaton's calm demeanour as Bruce Wayne which turns to cold steel when he changes to his alter-ego, while Danny Devito, if never looking like my image of the comic-book Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer (who certainly does) obviously have fun wearing the clothes and hamming it up in the dark. Christopher Walken also gets in on the act as an un-costumed mega-rich do-badder who casually throws a pre-feline Selina Kyle out of a high-storey building amongst many other sins.Overall though, I felt the narrative was over-cluttered and that a shorter film concentrating on just one enemy would have made for a less demanding watch. For all that the film's special effects are terrific, with lots of pyrotechnics to the fore while I also detected more humour on board to help lighten the journey somewhat. Burton is unquestionably a very talented director with an eye for a memorable image of which there are several here but this time I think he overcooked the feast. On his next outing both director and star were gone although the idea of paired villains wasn't but by then the element of realism was starting to crumble, to the detriment of the drama on the screen. It would take Christopher Nolan to go back to Burton's dark vision, obviously via Frank Miller to produce a Batman for the 21st Century.",5,0,2,15 February 2011
Finding Nemo," Swimmingly good
","I'll confess straight away to having a fish-tank indoors and admit to loving my fish. I've always coveted the tropical fish tank with their beautiful colouring but never been encouraged to take them on as they're notoriously short-lived. This lovely animated feature showed me what I 've been missing as well as royally entertaining me too. The twin stories are skilfully inter-cut in a proper cinematic way, combining Marlin & Dory's ocean-wide search for Nemo is well inter-cut with Nemo's attempts to escape captivity from the evil fish-tank (now I feel guilty about owning one!). The dialogue is smart, occasionally funny, rarely sentimental and well delivered by the not-so-starry cast (and all the better for it - people like Hanks and Murphy hardly need the income after all), even if Albert Brooks as Marlin keeps reminding me of a young Mel Brooks!. The real stars of course are the animators, bringing to life, well, sort of, all manner of aquatic effects, from a shoal of fish on the move, to turtles riding the current and even the depiction of whales in motion. There's a light ecological message too as you'd expect, pushed just far enough to register but not repel, particularly with the children in the primary target-audience and of course the expected stuff about father - son relationships, growing pains, generation gap - can't believe I'm writing this about a movie about cartoon fish. Anyway, lasting a just-right 90 minutes, Finding Nemo is a pleasant warm-hearted family entertainment and I'll certainly think twice next time my fish-tank filter breaks down!",8,1,3,26 December 2007
Hot Fuzz," Good cops!
","One of the funniest modern comedies I've seen in ages, the UK teaching the US (are you watching Messrs Stiller and Sandler?), brilliantly spoofing both buddy-buddy cop blockbuster movies of the 90's and the older established Agatha Christie-type whodunnit murder mystery in the sleepy village by ramming them together with some force.Simon Pegg does his best Daniel Craig as the all-action, married-to-the-job big-city supercop who teams up with the local Superintendent's son in the wannabe village-of-the- year Sandford, where he tangles with pretty much all the local dignitaries to solve a baffling series of spectacularly gory accidents or should I say collisions.The gags come thick and fast with nary a drop in the pacing, director Wright using Bourne-like speed-cutting and multiple angle shots for maximum effect, really getting a chance to stretch out in the concluding car-chase and shoot-out at Somerfields.Pegg and Nick Frost are great, with their reluctant bromance, while the likes of Jim Broadbent, Billie Whitelaw and especially Timothy Dalton all get to join in the fun too. Throw in a brilliantly trashy (Sweet, T Rex even Cozy Powell!) soundtrack and you've got a well-nigh laugh-a-minute high-octane comedy which pulls out all the stops.Very, very funny indeed!",8,0,0,30 September 2012
The Natural," Natural sinner become winner
","Being Scottish, my acquaintance with live baseball is limited to attending three separate games while on holiday in the States and Canada, but there's something about the history of this almost uniquely American game (oddly enough, I'm also a keen fan of its nearest UK equivalent, cricket) which fascinates me and led me to recently watching in its entirety Ken Burns' extensive TV history of the sport.So, knowing just enough about the sport to get by, I settled down to enjoy this excellent baseball-themed movie and enjoy it I did. Directed in a fashion that aptly recalls classic Hollywood story-telling of the 20's and 30's, it relates its fable of the rise, fall and rise again of 'The Natural', the man with no past, Roy Hobbs, played handsomely, in more ways than one by Robert Redford. Only of course we do know his past, as shown in the prologue which introduces Hobbs and his exceptional talent, brutally curtailed following a moral misjudgement, the outcome of which delays his entry to the big league by some 17 years.Luckily, Redford can carry off looking 20 as required in the first 15 minutes, when he first shows his talent, albeit in pitching, with an encounter with a thinly disguised Babe Ruth, played with gusto by Joe Don Baker. When he returns years later to make his destiny in the sport, he comes across the usual distractions of sleazy journalism, shady financiers and of course, loose women, before he gets a wake-up call just in time from his true love and gives the ending the story deserves, even as I understand it contradicts that of the source novel.Shot in appropriately golden light and strongly played by most of the principals, the only weak link being Kim Basinger as the scheming sex-pot out to turn his head, this is an exciting and emotionally engaging story. Perhaps the villains of the piece could have been drawn a shade darker and Robert Duvall is slightly underused as the scheming journalist scenting a story, but a young Glenn Close is just right as the grown-up girl Hobbs left behind, whose eleventh-hour revelation inspires his final act.Director Levinson pulls out the stops for the big set-piece climaxes on the field as Redford serves up the clichés of 'hitting the cover off the ball' and 'stopping the clocks', before literally 'lighting the lights' at the conclusion. He thus invests the sport with the near-mythical symbolism its devoted supporters claim as its due and I for one am not about to deny them.In a crowded market-place, this has to be one of the best sporting films ever, while I hold my breath waiting for a major movie about cricket.",8,1,2,20 January 2013
Home Alone," Merry Kidsmas
","That cover shot of young McCaulay Culkin's goofy face has put me off watching this festive movie for years but in mid December on a rainy, cold afternoon and having watched most of the best of the Christmas-themed movies around, I turned to this at last. And sure, Culkin gets more screen close-ups than Greta Garbo ever did, either due to the director wishing to emphasise his 'cuteness' or maybe in some way to cover up his inexperience at acting, but the movie is so fun that you get used to it as it rolls entertainingly along.Seems to me that young Kevin gets the best Christmas present ever when, as he thinks, he makes his horrible family disappear over the holidays, but when house burglar Joe Pesci and his hapless accomplice determine to loot Culkin's parents' house, the fun and games commence as the kid fights back, plus of course there's time for a big dollop of Yuletide sentimentality as the youngster makes friends at last with the sinister-seeming old man next door, sorting out the latter's family problems in the process.The movie's really fun as you warm to the initially brattish Kevin and have to admire his methods of keeping the baddies at bay, firstly with his automated mannequin show and then of course when he seemingly booby-traps the whole house to repel the invaders. Pesci is very good, offering us a family-entertainment version of the psychos he plays for Scorcese, with nary a cuss-word in sight but it's the kid's movie with young McCaulay's acting improving as the movie progresses which almost makes me think the film was shot in chronological order.I have to admit that before watching, I expected this to be an indigestible slice of over- sentimental nonsense, but instead was well-entertained by a clever and funny family feature which rightly deserves its reputation as a latter-day Christmas dare I say classic.",7,0,0,6 December 2015
The Hustler," Right on Cue
","I recently bought a house where the previous owner left amongst a whole bunch of other old furniture a dilapidated pool table. It was the only item we kept and after upgrading it, it now gets used a lot. Along with it he left a battered old slim paperback book called 'Minnesota Fats Plays Pool' and even as I appreciate now that the real Fats appropriated the name of Jackie Gleason's character for his own ends, I feel a connection to this movie.I've also been listening lately to podcasts on the fall-out from the Hollywood Blacklist of the late 1940's and 50's and am aware of co-writer and director Robert Rossen's less than stellar role in that particular shark-pool. It might be too easy a read-across to contemporary Hollywood but here he posits Paul Newman's fast-cuing Eddie Felson as an ordinary guy with a particular talent in a sink or swim scenario in the seamy world of high-stakes pool. However for Eddie to survive and thrive, he has to decide the price on his soul and whether it's worth hanging onto. Rossen made his own choice when he named names to the H.U.A.C. and I couldn't help wondering whether this was his shot at personal redemption. The film was successful and was recognised by the Academy but still begs the question if it was worth it for the man behind the camera.Putting the politics on one side, it's undeniably a good movie. Fuelled by a cool, atmospheric jazz soundtrack and fittingly shot in monochrome, Newman is the cue ball on the table trying to call the shots not realising until too late that the real shot-maker is George C Scott's heartless, money-grabbing professional gambler who ends up managing him. Piper Laurie is the eight-ball Eddie finds himself behind. A pretty but lonely lush, living off her estranged daddy's pay-checks, her and Eddie somehow connect through the alcoholic haze as two out-of-control self-haters seeking solace in one another but their stormy relationship (he actually hits her at one point) is doomed from the start and when Scott seeks to exercise a 75% share of her too, the outcome is inevitable.At least by the movie's close Fast Eddie has revenged himself against the Fat man and purged himself of Scott's pernicious control, but in the end what sort of future has he bought himself and is he any better off at the end of the film than at the start?Newman, in one of his favourite roles, occasionally too obviously shows us the Method, but mostly convinces as the self-possessed hustler who learns too late that winners don't always win. Laurie is very good as the shopworn Sara battling her alcoholism and self-esteem in her fight to save Eddie from Scott and indeed himself. Scott also shines as the biggest shark in the pool, the conniving high-roller who wants to control everything and everyone in his orbit. However, you can't always tell which way the balls will fall as he finally learns in the elegiac final scenes.As a pretend pool-player I enjoyed the trick-shot set-ups and both Newman and Jackie Gleason as the inscrutable Fats seem natural and able behind their sticks, while as a film-buff I equally appreciated the gritty depiction of this unglamorous profession and its two-bit players.",7,0,0,4 December 2019
Spotlight," Boston creep party
","This excellent film dramatises the Boston Globe newspaper's exposure in 2001 of the years old child abuse practices of hundreds of Roman Catholic priests in and around the city and the attendant cover-up by the powers that be in the church from the Cardinal on down. More than that, it points the finger at the shoulder-shrugging complicity of other areas of the establishment like the law courts, police and the press, including the paper's own earlier self, burying previous isolated reports on the subject deep in the paper without thought of following up the bigger story. Indeed it takes the arrival of a new editor at the paper to revive the story which he does by setting loose its specialist four-strong investigative team known as Spotlight on the case, where they soon find substance to the rumours and fight to bring it to light.The subject matter is of course bound to invite viewer sympathy but the film doesn't simply prey on that. Reminiscent at times of the likes of 'All The President's Men' and classic TV series like 'Lou Grant', it works by taking us inside the workings of the paper and avoiding gratuitous dramatic showdowns with either individual priests or even the misguided Cardinal, the climax to the sordid affair is simply the story finally hitting the streets on the paper's front page. There's no big self- congratulatory triumphant scene at the end, merely a shockingly long list of other instances the world over of the church covering over the traces of paedophile priests abusing their positions of trust.The acting is high quality, with the revitalised Michael Keaton as the sage leader of the team, keen to bring down not just the Cardinal but the whole cover-up system which protected the offending priests by signing them out of commission with anodyne phrases like 'on sick leave' for example. He's driven by his own incidental complicity in not digging deeper into the story when it first aired years before but it's he who eventually drives out the vital corroboration which enables it to finally get out there. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams are also very good as the Rossi and Billie of the team, teasing the story out of the worn-out and cowed solicitor who first tried to put forward the victims' stories, again well played by Stanley Tucci and generally putting in the hard yards behind the story to get it into print.There's probably another story in there about the Vatican's complicity in the hushing up process, but the film is probably right to localise the action and let the viewer contemplate this and other pertinent questions (like where are the offending priests now, for one) arising from this worthy and well made picture.",8,2,3,7 February 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," It's the end of the world but not as we know it...
","Contemporary 'disaster' flick, making up in bombast and special effects what this type of movie almost customarily loses by way of coherent plotting, thin characterisation and hackneyed dialogue. We get all sorts of clichéd situations flung at us here, from 'buddy buddy', to 'teen romance', 'family dysfunction' - and that's just involving Jake Gyllenhaal alone! The movie would like to think it's a 'The Searchers' for the 'noughties', as 'I told you I was right, Mr President' maverick scientist Dennis Quaid sets out on an epic journey to New York to rescue his disenchanted son, played with doe-eyed solipsism by a typecast Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake and his two college chums, one his would-be girlfriend, of course get caught in the epicentre of the perfect storm, which, much to my chagrin has already by that time taken out my native Scotland and now threatens to engulf NYC. Somehow by a combination of ingenuity, bravery and of course that particular type of Hollywood luck which seems to bless the lead players in all films of this type Dennis somehow makes it to Jake and his crew for that special bonding moment you know has been due from the first moments of the film. There are really no acting kudos here, everyone speaks their clichéd dialogue reasonably enough (I was able to successfully play 'predict the next line' on many occasions throughout) so that the film stands or falls on its SFX. On the whole these are fine although any involving a downward shot onto a dangling individual over an abyss (which happens at least twice) are poorly finished although the large scale depictions of NYC flooded by a tsunami and the shots of earth from space are convincing. The film tries but fails to credibly connect with and elevate itself to the ranks of previous sci-fi classics in terms of use of symbolic imagery, most blatantly, the incorporation of the Statue of Liberty from 'Planet of The Apes'. A film like this is okay if you disengage your brain at the pop-corn stand, but I long for an intelligent disaster movie with credible characters speaking naturally and behaving normally. Some humour would have been of use too. Three 'wozzat for?' moments to make you scratch your head bemusedly - the ridiculous chase scene involving escaped wolves, the insertion of Culture Club's 'Do You Really Wanna Hurt Me' into the soundtrack and surely the longest set of technical credits ever racked up by a single movie.",4,1,3,23 June 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Long (keel) haul
","I quite like theme park thrill rides. Most of the best rides condense the excitement into ten minutes, however watching this dramatised fun-park attraction for nearly three hours felt like being trapped on a big-dipper interminably and that, even to a white-knuckle fan like me, is way too long.The plot is convoluted beyond belief, characters die, come back to life and then die yet again for barely credible reasons, leaving me confused as to what was and wasn't real. The production strains for bigger and better effects as it goes, from a ship that moves on millions of crabs, to Jack's multi-personality split, to Calypso's giantess metamorphosis, to the final ships' battle on the edge of a raging maelstrom, they just numbingly keep coming at you, interspersed with lots of deliberately exaggerated ham acting and weak attempts at humour.The actors all have a great time, as you'd expect although it's odd that the likes of Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom all seem to garner more screen-time than the headlining Johnny Depp although any reversal wouldn't have made much difference. Rolling Stone Keith Richards actually steals the show with his cameo, but of course he's not acting wasted and decadent because he is already,All told, it just didn't work for me at all and I felt at the end like I'd endured over two hours of being hit about the face by a wet fish.",3,2,3,17 February 2012
Spider-Man 3," Sticky situation
","Box-office success that it was, this Spider Man sequel shows the same traits of slackness and tiredness that the Superman and Batman films of the Christopher Reeve and Tim Burton eras did. The film's become much longer, indeed bloated, the action sequences become fewer and attempts at often campy but unfunny humour intrude. That's not all that's wrong with this movie. The SFX are not of the best quality, an important piece of Spidey history gets re-written, as Uncle Ben gets murdered again, but this time by a different guy who of course, morphs into our hero's latest home-town super- villain plus there are just too many villains competing to down the web-slinger. Between Venom, The Hobgoblin (or the New Goblin as he's termed here) and Sandman, too many crooks definitely spoil the broth.Peter Parker's on-off romance with Kirsten Dunst's rather dismal Mary Jane Parker trundles on too and of course he has his usual existential crisis triggered this time by being taken over by an alien micro-organism which twists his mind but for some reason has a weakness for loud clanging noises. The plot too seems borrowed from 'Superman 2' meets Star Wars as Spider Man gets in touch with his bad self, losing his popularity and his girl as he does so. Throw in a lame attempt at humour which sees Pete come over all John Travolta and yet another unnecessary Stan Lee cameo and you can see why this seems to me by far the weakest entry in the franchise so far.I don't know the exact reasons why Marvel chose to reboot Spider Man after this admittedly very successful entry, at least judging by its box-office returns, but the signs of wear are there. I just found the endless shots of the expressionless faces of Maguire and Dunst only added to the tedium, the former only occasionally gets into costume and finally who was it who put the title end sequence at the start of the movie, holding up proceedings interminably it seemed.I've still to watch the most recent remake of the title character but hope it manages to spin back to the promise of the first film of this particular three.",4,0,2,3 September 2015
Zodiac," Overlong and winding road
","Not sure what to make of this dog's breakfast of a movie. Part police procedural, part historical recreation, part murder mystery, part serial - killer docudrama, I think it falls between too many stools and loses its way through its way overlong playing time until the downbeat climax(if that's not too oxymoronic) when the Jake Gyllenhaal character gets to look the main Zodiac killer suspect in the eye. Bits of it I liked, the ensemble acting (the cops beat the reporters hands down), the musical soundtrack and the newsroom recreation straight out of 'Lou Grant' but I kept looking at my watch in anguish each time Gyllenhall's character reaches yet another dead-end in his obsessive journey to the truth. Strange to criticise the director of 'Seven' for a lack of suspense at key points (the murders and the confrontation between Gyllenhaal and Zodiac's creepy former - employer just before the end, just don't engage} but I was never brought to the edge of my seat. Still, I just about survived until the end but feel the movie could have benefited from a bit less meaningless characterisation and more tightly focused editing to deliver a more satisfying movie experience.",6,3,6,19 August 2007
Milk," No rabbit, this Harvey
","This film portrayal of the life and times of Gay Rights campaigner, Harvey Milk, while sometimes difficult to watch, nevertheless seemed to catch the zeitgeist of an important time in American politics when the homosexual lifestyle was under attacks from Bible-thumping zealots such as Anita Bryant and Higgins. I personally think some of the claims made on the DVD extra features comparing Milk to Martin Luther King and Gandhi are a bit overstated but then I'm not San Franciscan or gay and certainly admire Milk for the stand he took not only against the political but indeed physical threat that same-sex people had to endure even from the local police.Director Gus Van Sant captures the era using an almost fly-on the-wall documentary approach, intermixed with actual footage of the original time and almost without exception picking actors with strong resemblances to their real-life counterparts. It helps considerably having Sean Penn throw himself as one would expect, whole-heartedly into the lead part, although I suspect some concession to the box-office with gay love-scenes relatively underrepresented in the actual movie. That said, there's no escaping the campness and effeminacy of most of the lead characters which for me took a little getting used to until I realised Milk's central point that gays were being discriminated against just like any other minority just for being different.Milk is presented in a warts and all manner, including his predilection for falling in and out of love / lust with usually much younger men, his terrible fashion-sense and frequent bad- hair days. Nevertheless setting up his Camera Castro shop on a San Francisco main street and then standing up for his fellow-gays as their charismatic leader against police and then political oppression in the less than politically enlightened 70's unquestionably took guts and he sure had plenty. His tragic demise, along with his right-on town mayor by a surprising assassin's bullet at the film's climax came as a shock, if like me the viewer wasn't aware of the details of his life and death but this of course plays up Milk's martyr status and triggers the 30000-strong midnight procession by his supporters in direct response to his death, ending the film on an inspiring, positive note.I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, ultimately sympathising, if initially unwillingly, with this irascible, contrary but ultimately likable character who stood up rather than be put down and I think his memory was well served by a capable director and a committed and talented lead actor.",7,0,2,5 October 2014
The Prestige," Smoke and mirrors
","Engaging, engrossing but in the end, for me, confusing movie helmed by dark mystery purveyor extraordinaire Christopher Nolan. The movie plays like a magicians' version of 'The Duellists', with Jackman and Bale vying to pull off the perfect disappearing act on the Edwardian stage. To make such a thin premise the basis for a whole movie takes some doing and it's to Nolan's credit that he pretty much pulls it off. I did find the constant change of narrative perspective somewhat confusing and the 'reveal' at the end far fetched to say the least (unless I'm wrong Bale's disappearing device is actually a duplicating or cloning machine, with the doppelganger dying every night) but the journey along the way is well purveyed, helped by a stellar cast on good form. Michael Caine as elder statesman and lead narrator holds the story together, the stunts are effectively conveyed and throughout the dark cinematography holds your attention. As I stated above though, the implausibility of the piece ultimately detracts from the end result. Derren Brown does it better on TV!",6,0,2,10 October 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Stinker, paler, borer why?
","I know my limits. I just couldn't follow the plot of this labyrinthine movie adapted from John Le Carre's novel, which had previously been made into an award-winning BBC TV series with Alec Guinness as spy-catcher George Smiley. That itself had been a multi-part production but here the action, or should that be inaction, is condensed into a still lengthy two and a half-hour film.It seemed that every time I picked up a plot thread, it led me down an inconclusive side-road with no real drama at any point. Even the revelation of the mole in the British Secret Service was delivered unspectacularly, in keeping with the dogmatic realism of the rest of the narrative. Plot-lines circle round and turn in on themselves but ended up only dizzying my perceptive powers.The cream of contemporary British acting talent, old and young, pretty much is the whole cast but I didn't get any sense of the actors really inhabiting their parts. Gary Oldman's playing is very much in the shadow of Guinness and no-one else distinguished themselves in my eyes. They may have been in the book, I guess but strange scenes, like Smiley taking a constitutional swim in a public place or the Secret Service office party, just sort of occur, although to what end I'm not entirely sure. Apart from hearing the odd stray song on the soundtrack or sighting a vintage car in the streets, I hardly got the impression that this was the 70's at all. There were no news inserts or political issues to reference the times, leaving the story to unfold in a musty, grey netherworld, vaguely Kafka-ish in tone.Which may well have been the point. All I know is this film failed to connect with me at all and was a major disappointment for this particular viewer in almost very respect.",3,85,139,2 July 2014
"I, Tonya"," Ice Ice Baby
","As much as I knew about the ice-skater Tonya Harding was her association with the Nancy Kerrigan incident at the Winter Olympics and her being the only American woman to, up to that point, successfully pull off a triple salkot in competition. I know that she was disgraced as a result of her at-a-distance connection to the Kerrigan assault but that she'd come back into the public eye, competing recently in the American version of 'Strictly Come Dancing'. So what an eye-opener this low-budget feature was.It unflinchingly shows her upbringing, from a broken home, natch by a mother who clearly put the 'hard' into Harding. Chain-smoking, foul-mouthed and bullying, she's the ice skating equivalent of the infamous 'show-biz moms' you read about, hitting her daughter with everything but a little maternal love, deluding herself that her cruelty to her only child is self-sacrifice on her part designed to toughen up her little girl for the big bad world that's out there. Her father, you get the impression might just have made a difference, but you couldn't really blame him for baling out on his no-redeeming-features wife. There's dark comedy in these early scenes as mommie dearest Lavona ignores every social convention to promote her tomboy daughter's one given talent, her ice-skating ability but its typical of Tonya's luck that the man who comes into her life romantically turns out to be a jealous, possessive guy who behind his geeky moustache and weedy appearance threatens her, hits her and even shoots at her anytime she tries to break away from him. Not that Tonya is any shrinking violet, she gives as good as she gets in their numerous arguments and drop-down fights but unfortunately he's back in play just as she's readying herself for a crack at the Olympics where her biggest rival will be clean-cut, all-American Nancy Kerrigan, whose stylishly cut, virginal white skating costume contrasts vividly with Harding's old-fashioned, frills and bows homemade outfit.The 'incident' itself, a cockeyed plan by hubby and his meathead bodyguard chum, sees the latter beat Kerrigan on the leg after a training session, becomes international news as the Winter Olympics of 1992 come around pitching the rivals head-to-head with a recovered Kerrigan finishing a close-up second but a psyched-out Harding come in a lowly eighth and that after a controversial re-skate when she dramatically stops her first routine as her boot lace comes undone.This movie is the women's ice-skating equivalent of 'Raging Bull', a warts and all portrayal of a kid from the wrong side of the tracks striving to make something of herself with everything seemingly stacked against her. Her greatest moment is shown not as winning Skate America or coming second in the World Championships but the first time she nails that near impossible jump on the ice. From there it's downhill all the way as we see her struggle with her notoriety in the aftermath of all the publicity post-conviction, trying to scratch a living, even trying pro-boxing for a spell.The performances by the three leads, Margot Robbie as Harding, Allison Janney as the mother from hell and Sebastian Stan as her unhinged husband are terrific. The direction style is a clever mix of eye-on-the-wall documentary realism including recreated to-camera interviews with the main participants and fourth-wall-breaking asides together with convincing depictions of the ice-skating sequences.It all makes for a deliberately awkward but compulsive insight into Stateside trailer-trash living and also how hard it is for those on the inside to break free from this rough and tumble upbringing and make something of themselves. In this biopic, Tonya Harding tried as hard as she could but was literally born to lose, the little victories and happiness she achieved along the way, scant recompense for a reputation tarnished forever by events outwith her control.",8,14,17,21 May 2018
Dear John," Tanks and hankies
","A big old-fashioned weepie, set in the recent past and coloured with its references to 09/11 and the succeeding war in Iraq. The story of star-crossed lovers- strong, silent, but with a violent streak, soldier John & beautiful, intelligent guitar-strumming Savannah, their relationship is put to the test by the intervention of the war and their coincidental interaction with people with autism, namely John's father and Savannah's family friend's young son. If that sounds like a fairly contrived story-line, then the reason that he ends up receiving her 'Dear John' letter while serving abroad will stretch credulity even further as will the way that it still ends up all happy ever after for the two by the very end. One senses too that life in the army today is not quite the buddy-fest that is portrayed here. The film is beautifully shot in warm colour tones and in the acting stakes, As Savannah Amanda Seyfried gives an appealing and attractive performance. I was less convinced by Channing Tatum as John, although his surly character certainly gives him less to play with. Correspondingly I didn't quite buy into their relationship and actually thought that his receiving the title letter was the end of the film, rather than the springboard to reunion it later turned out to be. That said, it was nice to watch a latter-day film in the old tradition, without profanity or violence, the love scenes between the couple in particular being sensitively filmed. All in all, a pleasant film my wife and I could both watch together quite happily although there were probably too many coincidences in the story for it to properly hang together.",6,0,0,7 August 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Tintin out
","As a young teenager I avidly borrowed as many of the Tintin comic books from my library as I possibly could and indeed many years later as an adult, bought them all to have them permanently. I was therefore more than curious to see what Steven Spielberg would do with the character, with this, the first big-time movie feature of the young Belgian reporter and his faithful dog Snowy.I really appreciated the title sequence with the lettering in the original style of the books but must admit that afterwards I found it difficult to completely accept the motion-capture technique employed. I guess it's a similar criticism which was levelled at say 'The Polar Express', where the characters depicted are more human than cartoon, putting at odds somewhat the toon-town type various stunts and action sequences which occur to almost-human looking characters.I also felt that there just too many of these big set-pieces which gave me battle-fatigue in the end. There's no shortage of ingenuity or spectacle in some of these scenes but coming in rapid succession as they do, they got a bit too commonplace in my view. Characterisation not unnaturally is shallow and distinctly one-dimensional while the story is relentlessly episodic. When Tintin and / or Captain Haddock miraculously escapes death for the umpteenth time, it takes a little of the suspense away for what comes next.Of course it's difficult to comment on the acting given it's all done in the animation and to be honest I barely noticed the big-name voice actors employed. I wasn't impressed by the super-confident reference at the end to a sequel which four years after first release still noticeably hasn't seen the light of day.Don't get me wrong, quite a lot of the movie I did like and there were some spectacular directorial flourishes to enjoy, none more than when a handshake between Tintin and the Captain dissolves into a landscape. Still, I found it on the whole a bit too loud and crash-bang-wallop for my tastes, so that the characters were almost overpowered by the action raging around them. Would Herge have approved? I'm not so sure, this looks a wee bit like one of those vanity projects big-name directors can indulge themselves in without completely taking their audience along with them.",6,2,3,16 March 2015
Moana," Island girl
","This was another highly enjoyable Disney CGEN feature with an exciting story, lots of laughs, good songs, fine characterisation and most of all, brilliant animation.From the depiction of luxuriant tropical wildlife, frothy ocean spray and most of all the nuances of the 'human' characters, the film is a feast for the eyes. As for the ears, they are well served too by catchy, idiomatic, singalong numbers and witty, funny dialogue not scared to run a little risquÃ© to get a laugh.The story, of Disney necessity, touches on the tried and true, a young independent 'princess', yearning for change and adventure, surmounting seemingly insurmountable odds on a quest to save the day, accompanied of course by a wise-cracking companion and just to top things off, a cute, dumb pet.The songs even if they seem like they've fallen off the same wagon as those in 'Frozen' are nonetheless mostly pleasant and memorable and are well sung by the cast, even Dwayne Johnston. My main carp would be the use of derivative minion-lite coconut pirates Moana and Maui encounter on their journey but otherwise I found myself frequently caught up by the duo's escapades and interaction arriving at a big happy ever after climax which outdid the rest of the SFX in the process.Lovely film, first class family entertainment.",7,1,1,2 January 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Mad Doctor's orders
","I came to 'Dr Strangelove' after watching the alternative contemporary movie based on the same source novel, the super-serious 'Fail Safe', which may have been a mistake on my part. It probably didn't help either that I've been lately tracking down and watching other Cold War political thrillers of the era. I think what I'm trying to say is that I didn't quite get Dr Strangelove, heretic as that may appear given its prestigious reputation.
I understand too that its anti-war message perhaps had more relevance and resonance to its original audience which had just gone through the whole Cuban Missile Crisis scenario, but for me the message here overcame the medium with Kubrick using a bazooka to crack open these particular nut(case)s.
I love Peter Sellers and of course he ably demonstrates his comic versatility and mastery of his craft over the course of the three roles he plays but just like Slim Pickens, George C Scott and Sterling Hayden his fellow-crazies, the characterisations used are just too broad, blunt and overpowering. I also found the running gags centring on sexual innuendo just too crude and obvious.
I do recognise that some of the scenes have become iconic like Pickens riding the missile down to destruction and Sellers gradually more deranged title character at the end plus I love the last line of the movie even if I suspect more of Sellers improvisatory skill than Kubrick's directorial hand in it.
However I can't escape my conclusion that the movie seems overrated and more of a museum piece at least to my eyes.",5,3,7,15 December 2018
Megamind," Bad for good
","I'm a bit of a comic buff and have enjoyed most of the glut of action and animated super- hero features since 'Superman' blazed the trail back in the 70's. Of course in Toon land even more things are possible, including 3D action as in this highly amusing spoof comedy- adventure which neatly inverts the good guy and bad guy stereotypes we're so familiar with. Here, the good guy, Metro Man is a pretentious, vainglorious super-smoothie, who quickly tires of the status and responsibilities his powers confer on him, while the so-called bad guy Megamind turns out to be a sensitive, conscientious loner, looking for love and female companionship. In the middle of them stands feisty Lois Lane-type reporter Roxanne, who despite herself finds herself falling for the adopted persona of the baddie.The film makes subtle points about being true to one's self, not judging by appearances and overcoming prejudice but never at the expense of some spectacularly drawn action sequences or hilarious verbal and sight gags, the best of which was probably the mickey-take of Marlon Brando's Jor-El in the afore-mentioned 'Superman - The Movie'. The 3D content only enhanced my enjoyment, especially a replica scene of the famous James Dean 'Boulevard Of Broken Dreams' poster.For me, this sharp-as-a-tack production joins the hallowed ranks of 'The Incredibles' and 'Mystery Men' as thoroughly enjoyable send-ups of a still burgeoning cinematic phenomenon, as witness the continuing graduation of DC and Marvel Comic heroes to Hollywood blockbuster status.",8,1,2,17 May 2012
The Polar Express," Express delivery
","I thought I'd seen most of the major Hollywood Christmas films down the years but somehow missed out on this gem, at least up until now.Like the questioning children on the train to the North Pole, I found myself thoroughly transported by an engaging story, exciting sequence of events and of course an all-tied- up-in-a-bow happy ending. The unusual nature of the super-realistic animation technique employed took a little getting used to for me but once we get on board the train, it's full steam ahead for thrills and heart-warming sentiment.Tom Hanks is just right in his main role as the genial train conductor while the late Michael Jeter in his last filmed role is effectively, if sadly ironically, cast as a helpful ghost. The detail and vivacity in the animation compensated for the too-real appearance of the characters and there's a pleasing selection of older-style Christmas songs, that is until Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler makes an unnecessary and unhelpful cameo appearance.While not the most original Christmas story ever, the time-worn tale of a growing child's wavering belief in Santa Claus eroded by maturity with even the device of a magic train transporting children to a magical land having echoes of 'Harry Potter', nevertheless I have no hesitation in naming this amongst the best Christmas movies I've yet seen. In fact my only major regret watching it was that it wasn't the 3D version which I'll make a point of donning when I watch it again as one my Yuletide perennials next year!",9,1,5,16 December 2013
The Best Years of Our Lives," Life after wartime
","A really interesting and remarkable film, all the more so for being made in almost the immediate aftermath of the Allied victory of the Second World War when you'd expect Hollywood to produce celebratory even triumphal movies. Instead the viewer is presented with the intertwining stories of three battle-scarred veterans, ex-banker Fredric March, who tries to blot out his memories of the war from a bottle, shop assistant Dana Andrews, sufferer from PTSD, who low-status civvy-street return to the same lowly, indeed lower status job doesn't satisfy the ambitions of his floozy wife Virginia Mayo and young Harold Russell, a real-life vet and first time actor whose hands got blown off in a bomb explosion. Complications arise in particular when Andrews reciprocates March's daughter's attraction to him.The film trails its future intentions in its opening scene when Andrews returning pilot is unable to pay the fare of a regular flight back home, his place on the plane taken by the next in line, a rich middle aged businessman who can afford the cost of extra luggage which he gets carried around for him a black attendant. The way that nations treat their returning fighting forces still makes the news today, but back then was seen to be particularly patronising, unsympathetic and miserly. All three men struggle to adjust to everyday life and come up variously against snobbery, condescension and ignorance, but with all of them too, their wartime experiences have scarred them crippling them emotionally and making it hard for them to fit back into society after five years away.For me however, I just could have done without the romance that springs up between Andrews and Wright, which, sensitively written and played as it was, seemed to belong to a different, melodramatic if still modern movie with its outlook on divorce. Similarly, the happy ending that all three men get seemed a little too much to be playing to the gallery, because I'm pretty sure that it wasn't the case for many a returning vet at the time.The acting by all is sensitively and intuitively played, not forgetting the fine work by the women too, Mayo, Wright, Myrna Loy as March's worldly-wise wife and Cathy O'Donnell as Russell's loyal fiancée while director Wyler, ably assisted by master cameraman Gregg Toland is a masterclass in understatement. It would have been easy for Wyler to milk certain scenes and lapse into sentimentality but he never does so. A box office smash on release and much garlanded with Oscars, it's an excellent, engrossing and perceptive study of how the war affected the lives of both active participants and their families back home.",7,2,4,12 February 2018
The Town," Let's go downtown...
","I remember laughing out loud at the aberration of a movie that was 'Pearl Harbour' and in particular Ben Affleck's 'Kinda, sorta, coulda...' chat-up line and haven't even seen 'Gigli', but it's fair to say that with this and his earlier effort 'Gone Baby Gone' he's certainly found his métier, not only in front, but also behind the camera.'The Town' (a poor title for a fast-moving film like this) is a gritty, contemporary heist thriller, with believable characters in largely realistic situations and with credible motives for their actions. I say largely, because you do have to get over the improbability of Affleck's serial armed robber's affair with accidental hostage Rebecca Hall and a series of thrilling but unbelievable car-chases and shoot-outs.That said, the latter are delivered with skill and precision, while the attempts at character development are rewarded by the depth they add to the plot line. The acting too is of a high standard, with, to be honest, most of the supporting participants outshining the headline names of Affleck, Hall and 'Mad Men's' Jon Hamm, in particular Jeremy Renner as Affleck's trigger-happy right-hand man and the late Pete Postlethwaite as the ruthless Irish overseer of the gang's criminal operations.I visited Boston once over 15 years ago whch included taking in a baseball match at the venerable Fenway Park venue and enjoyed seeing this and other locations again, but better yet was just to chance to watch that rarity, a gripping and involving contemporary crime thriller, which this certainly was.",8,5,7,9 June 2012
Elf," Your very good elf...
","A delightful Christmas fantasy for all the family, proof that latter-day Hollywood can still knock out a charming festive film, just like in the old days.Sharing with the classic 'Miracle on 34th Street' its New York department store setting, the story here is as improbable as any you'll encounter on any Feast of Stephen you care to mention. But forget that and just enjoy Will Ferrell accomplishing a wide-eyed but never over-played naiveté rarely seen since Jimmy Stewart in 'Harvey' as the innocent elf (actually a human baby born out of wedlock) abroad, attempting to bond with his curmudgeonly old dad this particular Christmas (of course!).Thus Buddy's many humorous adventures and encounters with the people, sights and sounds of New York naturally take us on an emotional roller-coaster ride but by the end of the movie, as if you didn't know, he's gotten a pretty co-worker (the wonderfully named Zooey Deschanel) to fall in love with him, made up big-time with his dad and just for good measure restored Christmas spirit to all and sundry in a nice, even exciting conclusion, which gives us the memorable sight of Santa's sleigh taking off over Central Park so that old Saint Nick can get on with his naughty or nice list.The casting is very good, James Caan, like fellow 70's tough guy De Niro before him, adapting neatly to family comedy, with in support, the ever-lovely Mary Steenburgen as his too-good-for-him wife and old MTM stalwarts Bob Newhart and Ed Asner, even more improbably as Buddy's adopted elf-father and Santa Claus respectively. Ferrell makes the film though, his wide-eyed wonder infectious right from the outset. The only real drawback for me really was the too-obvious product placement inserts. Otherwise, the film stays away from maudlin sentimentality particularly in its treatment of children and is filled with uplifting Christmas music, settings and spirit, rarely stooping to vulgarity for its laughs (okay, we do get a couple of near-obligatory flatulence and burping jokes, but that's okay, kids love 'em!).I heartily recommend anyone in need of a Christmas tonic to watch 'Elf' and bring out your inner-child.",7,1,2,14 December 2009
Shutter Island," To the lighthouse
","Not quite sure what genre this piece of psychodrama schlock from Martin Scorces belongs too, but it's an interesting piece, straining perhaps after the heights of say Hitchcock's 'Spellbound' or Clouzot's 'Les Diabolique', but falling a little bit marooned on its own shore by the time we reach the conclusion.For one thing it's too long and frequently disappears up its own backside in its clever-clever exposition, plus, I guessed the 'twist' very early on in the piece. Also Leo DiCaprio is no Gregory Peck and for me never really engaged my sympathy or even general interest as Scorcese explores the canyons of his mind.The symbolism throughout is a little heavy - handed too, the bleak, isolated Shutter Island itself akin to DiCaprio's tortured mind-scape and the lighthouse as his shining way-out, although I suspect Mr Scorcese doesn't really want us to get too metaphysical here. If anything it comes off best as a homage to that strain of movie psycho-horror usually peopled with Vincent Price or possibly the comic pulp fiction of the same era.I enjoyed it and applaud the director's left-field excursion away from the mainstream - interestingly the last time he ventured near this territory was in the unashamedly populous 'Cape Fear'. I got into it more once I realised Scorcese was presenting entertainment over art, but felt it could have been drawn tighter together into a more coherent and exciting whole.",6,1,3,25 July 2010
Tangled," Goldilocks And Her Free Hairs
","An apt film, as it turned out, to watch in lockdown, this free adaptation of the old fairy tale for me is the way Disney should be going, finding fresh tales to tell from the great collections rather than remaking their classic animations of the past as real-life features.A winning combination of humour, music and animation, I rate this one of the best Pixar movies I've seen. Personally I do find the depiction of the characters slightly problematic, especially females with their massive eyes and eyelashes just making them, particularly the heroines, too cutesy. Perhaps the same could be said of the heavies whose ugly features are a bit too exaggerated too but I did like the way roguish Flynn / Eugene was shown. As for the backgrounds and individual details, these are pretty wonderful, like the depictions of grass, flowing water and of course Rapunzel's hair. Better yet is the imaginative staging of shots, some taking viewpoints we would now recognise as drone shots while others just demonstrate motion and speed in pleasing and often exhilarating ways, the best of them probably being the flying lanterns, which look like magical dolly mixtures in motion, which, trust me, is a very good thing. I enjoyed the vocal acting, the better for not being done by some megastar who doesn't need the work.The story follows the classic template for this type of film, a young heroine (or hero), striking out for personal freedom, often to right a great wrong, usually against the advice of those around them. Usually too there is at least one and here in fact two cute animal companions, some romantic interest, a lot of feel-good songs, usually by Alan Menken and of course an evil baddie to pursue and thwart the central character until all is resolved for the inevitable happy ending.Of course I appreciate that a film like this isn't aimed at the likes of me but I still enjoyed many of the gags, the songs, even if it perhaps lacks a really big number that sticks in the memory and the rollicking story. Sure some of the individual characterisations aren't too different from what we've seen before but this is definitely higher-grade Disney and a good fun movie to watch at a time like this.",7,1,1,9 April 2020
Interstellar," Interstellar Underdrive
","I understand that director / producer Christopher Nolan was reaching for a sort of genre-busting, cross-cultural, auteur-imprint sci-fi blockbuster like '2001' or 'Close Encounters' and so establish himself in the cinematic firmament alongside the likes of Kubrick and Spielberg. Well I'll start by saying that those two particular films are far from my favourites by Stan and Steve and that I struggled to maintain my interest throughout this very long, very sciency movie.It takes an age to get going for one thing, over-developing in my opinion, the relationships between widower Matthew McConaughey, his grounded, land-loving son and reach-for-the-sky genius daughter, at the same time, establishing his own credentials as a brilliant maverick space-pilot, setting us up for the meeting with old prof Michael Caine in another predictable feet-under-the-bed casting by Nolan and his eco-warrior daughter, played by Anne Hathaway, where he learns of the secret plan to reach out to other worlds for possible solutions to the dust-storm crisis on our earth which if unchecked will see the planet's extinction. And so McConnaughey, Hathaway and their small band of brothers hop on a big space rocket to seek out the three most promising of the twelve missions previously undertaken to this end but the only meaningful encounter they have is with Matt Damon's stranded scientist. After an Apollo 13-like miraculous return to Earth, McConaughey gets all discombobulated in the space time continuum as he tries to go back to the original moment he left his daughter to leave her a message to save all the future bother. This circular-time folding-back-on-itself skit has been done before more than once (I can even remember it in a Harry Potter film), thus reducing its effectiveness for me at the climax and whilst I can otherwise see Nolan projecting big issues like faith, forgiveness, guilt, hope, survival, family and of course love, I found the film to be slow-moving and clunky in construction.I wasn't engaged by the main characters and frankly got lost in all the science too while as regards the acting Caine and Damon are badly miscast in my opinion and as for the android which looks like a clothes peg and all that Dylan Thomas 'Do Not Go Gentle...' guff - we all know it's a great poem anyway. Of course it may just be me remembering my thoughts on its two big-name antecedents but if people out there want to put this on a similar level to those they can be my guest. Not my type of film perhaps but then Nolan didn't do anything like enough here to change my preconceptions either.",4,1,3,28 August 2018
Full Metal Jacket," Child soldiers
","Obviously a very highly regarded movie directed by the great Stanley Kubrick and one I'm long overdue watching, my problem being this I'm not struck on war movies and Vietnam films in particular.That said no-one could gainsay the power of the film and its bloody realism has had a direct influence on subsequent films down the years like 'Blackhawk Down' and 'The Hurt Locker' to name but two. Shot in two distinct sections, the new marine recruits boot camp training under the Training Director from hell and the active tour of duty in Vietnam, both have shocking violently shocking outcomes which impact vividly on the memory. Arguably nothing is more eye-opening than the ritual humiliation the new young crop suffer as the desensitising process of turning them into thoughtless, unfeeling killing machines sees them go through unimaginably relentless mental torture and physical hardship, before one sensitive conscript is pushed too far.No sooner have you got over the shock sequence that culminates the training than the action is switched to Vietnam as we now see the same conscripts in real-life action, where for all their battle-hardened instillation, their inexperience causes them to make blundering errors with tragic consequences.Although I was impressed by Kubrick's direction with his famed roving, subjective camera- shots, in the end, I felt as if my senses had been assaulted for two hours, no doubt, partially his aim in the first place. There's no real structure to the film either, just before and after combat and I failed to see the young men bond together into a fighting unit, which again may have been intentional.I got the obvious message about thrusting completely unprepared young men into the white heat of battle but the constant violence, profanity and induced stress ultimately wasn't to my taste even as I accept the strength of the message it was putting across.",6,0,1,13 May 2013
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Ebbing away
","I'm not much of a fan of the whole Coen Brothers non-linear method of film making I have to say and identified quite early on that this particular movie fell squarely into whatever category that might be. I guess I should have known from the offbeat title and cast that things would go every which way but loose and so it proves.The initial idea of angry mother Frances McDormand broadcasting her frustration at her local police division by paying for three adjacent billboards to highlight their inaction over the unsolved rape and murder of her daughter some seven months previously might have worked in my view, not least as a whodunit, but was soon swamped by the introduction of several unusual characters and as many unlikely situations.So we're introduced soon enough to Woody Harrelson's terminally ill chief of police who McDormand's character names and shames on the billboards, Sam Rockwell as his mother-fixated, redneck deputy, with many more minor characters too numerous to mention, like the dwarf who alibis MacDormand at an important moment in the story, her abusive ex-husband now dating a 19 year old pretty bimbo and the new black chief of police who takes over Harrelson's job and whose first action is to overlook Rockwell's near-murder of the homosexual young owner of the billboard company with whom it's fair to say, he doesn't see eye to eye.The movie is a succession of tangential plot shifts and unbelievable coincidence. No doubt the writer - director was presenting us with themes of forgiveness, redemption and guilt set in the backward-thinking, crazy-quilt Deep South just to double underline these issues and make the viewer think deeply about all this serious existential stuff y'all.Sorry, but I didn't buy any of it. The acting didn't impress me much either, and that includes McDormand's Oscar-winning turn. In the end, for me, it was just another of those eccentric, eclectic films that tries to implant what it thinks are memorable images or extraordinary characters into the viewer's consciousness and by its exaggeration and distortion somehow mirror society in some profound way. All I got from it in the end was a mixed sense of manipulation, confusion and cynicism and how easy it is to put a movie like this together and call it art.Sorry, not for me and you can broadcast that on any billboard you care to mention.",1,9,15,3 June 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," Joads On The Road
","In which John Ford holds up John Steinbeck's black mirror to America at the end of a decade which started with the Stock Market Crash, continued with the Great Depression and ended with the nation contemplating its world position as Europe entered into war. The question posed by Steinbeck, amplified elegantly here by Ford, is what happens to the little people, the working class, indeed the underclass who get squeezed the most when the checks and balances in society break down. It's also about how fickle human nature becomes when the haves indeed have power over the have-nots and how cheaply some people can sell their humanity to maintain that superiority.The story is naturally episodic but the simple journey that the Joad family has to undertake to the much heralded promised land of California after being evicted from their land by the bank gives the movie a natural flow, although with this tale there are many more ebbs for the family to endure.My criticism of other Ford films has sometimes been the sentimentality and forced masculine humour he frequently inserts but there's no room for either of these traits here. The nearest we get to one of his familiar tropes is the weekend dance at the 'clean' government camp at which the Joads eventually arrive and are for the first time treated humanely by the staff, but even amongst the high spirits there's danger in the wings as the state troopers seek to gatecrash the party to make an arrest.While there are twelve in the extended family which first hits the road, there are only eight of them alive by the time they reach the relative safe haven at the end as the elderly grandfather and grandmother expire on the journey and two others drop out. The main characters though are Henry Fonda's Tom Joad, the family matriarch Ma Joad played by Joan Darwell and the idealistic lapsed preacher Cristy, played by John Carradine. They each come to very different ends but the film does at least conclude on a vaguely optimistic note with stirring speeches of defiance and even hope by Fonda and Darwell, both of which in fact were interpreted by the soon to be all-powerful House Un-American Activities Committee as evidence of a Communist propaganda subtext.Oscar-nominated Fonda is excellent as the combative, already road-hardened Tom, just released from jail for killing a man, who soon becomes the head of the family and so supersedes his father and his father in the hierarchy. Darwell won the Oscar as the Mother Earth character whose indomitable spirit drives the family on while Carradine memorably portrays a man who has lost his faith and who now channels his energies into human rebellion.Ford (and screenwriter Nunnally Johnston), even if he does bend to the box-office by editing and tweaking events in the book to afford at least a smidgeon of optimism at the end, treats the text in a starkly realistic almost quasi-documentary style as befits the seriousness of the subject matter, aided in this by the masterful black and white photography of the acclaimed Greg Toland. The sense of abject poverty is manifest in the way Ford and Toland frame their cast's often gaunt portraits against dark skies and blasted landscapes.This classic movie is a literary adaptation, history lesson and cry for social reform all rolled into one.",8,1,1,14 April 2020
The Devil Wears Prada," Wardrobe malfunction
","Sorry, not my cup of meat at all, to paraphrase Dylan, a chick-flick based on chick-lit - obviously this was my wife's choice for our Saturday night movie! That said, I really did sit down and try to give the movie every chance to entertain me, I mean I love US TV sit-coms which accomplish comedy by presenting likable characters in humorous situations with quick-fire dialogue and, yes, even gags but this flashy empty so-called rom-com scored zero out of three on that scale.Instead all I saw was a product placement paradise, so much so that I don't doubt the constantly name-checked contributors probably met the full budget for the film! Impossible you may say to make a film about the fashion magazine business without advertising every other fashion house (was Prada the highest bidder, I wonder?) and magazine chain, but it was so in my face and obvious that it distracted from the fare on the screen.The characters were all cardboard-thick (the oxymoron is deliberate) caricatures, Meryl Streep getting her 'Analyse This' make-over to zero effect and Anne Hathaway improbably transformed from geeky, kooky pleb to a made-up, power-dressed woman of today. The characters are too over-exaggerated, not helped by everyone over-acting for all their worth and the plot situations too obviously contrived, despite the true-to-life locations. Hathaway's character, for instance, the (I hesitate to use the word) epicentre of the film and the gal we're all meant to root for, loses all empathy and sympathy with the audience by betraying her ordinary average guy fiancÃ© for a one-night stand with Mr hunky, career-assisting super-journalist in glitzy Paris! I'll just accept that I'm obviously way too far out of the demographics here for the film to connect with me, but, despite being way over 40, happily married and living in Scotland, I still got 'Friends' a sit-com about single 30-somethings in New York...A movie as facile and empty as the world it seeks to further glamourise.",2,2,3,4 May 2009
Gone Baby Gone," Duff title, good movie...
","Obviously I don''t like the flippant title but this directorial debut from heretofore lightweight actor Ben Affleck packs a solid punch with this dark tale of child-kidnapping at the doss-end of society. Along the way it posits some tough questions about who decides what's best for a young child growing up in a, to put it mildly, dysfunctional household. Sadly every year brings with it some sensational story of the kidnapping and / or abuse of some tragic infant - fresh in the memory, certainly of UK citizens is the apparent kidnapping of baby Madeleine McCann whilst on holiday in Portugal and frankly and tragically too many other child abuse cases to mention (the death of 'Baby P' being the most recent high-profile story here) so that plots like this will always have topical significance.There are lots of good things to savour in this movie, most prominently the fully idiomatic playing of the cast, especially by the lesser known leads, little brother (Ben's image, to be truthful) Casey Affleck and his partner Angie Gennaro, who become embroiled in a sensational child-kidnapping incident amongst the low-life drug-fuelled underclass in Boston. I would argue however against the casting of the biggest name here, obviously Ben's old co-star chum Morgan Freeman, whose presence almost overpowers the movie and unfairly, in my opinion, skewers the viewer's critical faculties by the nature of his movie persona with its reputation for truth and trustworthiness - the final twist, in which his significance comes to the fore, fails to malign enough, his admittedly good intentions. That point itself is much better made with the excellent closing scene, where Affleck gets to witness at first hand the depressing outcome of his moral decision at the crux of the film as he witnesses first-hand the boozed-up, sluttish mother, only too happily abandoning her recently returned long-lost daughter to anyone passing (on this occasion, Affleck) so she can enjoy a night on the town - the fixed shot of Affleck and the child on the cheap sofa, staring mindlessly at the child's only toy, a TV screen, stays long in the memory. On a side-bar, I also found the utilisation of the background music very effective and the better for being so sparingly used.Fault-finding badge in place, however, besides my casting concern over Freeman noted above, I did occasionally find the plot just too ppaque, as, for example, we see played and replayed in a different way each time the key hand-over scene in the dark by the lake, while for me the ending was a bit too pat - such a tautly-drawn narrative just didn't need the plot twist grafted on here and I will lastly admit to having a lot of difficulty in listening clearly to the sometimes mumbled, occasionally incoherent dialogue of the characters.However, minor caveats aside, this was a welcome raw, tough and uncompromising movie, well-paced from start to finish. Get thee behind (and not in front of) the camera, Ben!",7,0,2,27 July 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," Aye, aye, Cap'n
","Well, my wife was out for the night so I thought I'd indulge myself with a big blockbuster super-hero flick. I'm much more of a DC than a Marvel fan, so Steve Rogers and his red white and blue alter-ego mean little to me, but that may have helped me enjoy the movie more, not trying to reference every character and scene back to the comic. As a movie, despite its being primarily set in World War II, it lacks the darkness and psychological depth of say Christopher Nolan's Batman and to be fair doesn't once threaten to go there. Thus most of the characters are very 2-dimensional, either very heroic or very evil and as you'd expect, a good portion of the running-time is given over to action sequences and while there's a smattering of humour throughout, I could have stood some more. The early, scene-setting section works the best I think, particularly the remarkable shrinking technology which reduces Chris Evans to a mere pipsqueak. Can it be a coincidence that another 98lb weakling who morphed into a fearless muscle-man, Charles Atlas, shared our hero's initials? To be fair, that's about as much depth, if that's the right word, as you get here. However the story zips along like a good comic should and the acting's okay too. Tommy Lee- Jones gets an easy pay-day as a sub-Patton crusty C.O. while Hayley Atwell does a nice all-action English rose. The Red Skull makes for a good villain, with Hugo Weaving hamming up it up convincingly as the other mad Nazi out to rule the world. I did find the tying-in of the film to the upcoming Avengers movie as blatant as Stan Lee's pointless cameo, but all-told this was an enjoyable if not exactly marvellous comic-strip outing, the better for its war-time setting.",6,2,3,2 May 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne's best yet
","Great example of the modern action thriller as Matt Damon reprises the title role and basically travels the world with the CIA on his trail as he seeks the truth about his amnesia. Okay none of it is remotely grounded in reality but for sheer white-knuckle ride entertainment, this can hardly be beat, so sit back, strap yourself in and go with the flow. The set - pieces are terrific, from the murder in the crowds at London Victoria Station to Bourne's pursuit of a top CIA assassin on the trail of his female ally - the from-behind shot of Bourne crashing through an apartment window at the scene's climax is classic - as well as a heart pounding car chase. Characterisation is of necessity slim, with few exceptions it's polarised goodies versus baddies, but there's no denying Damon's presence in the title role, essential as the film stands or falls on his ability to carry the viewer along with him in his quest (subjective shots are plentiful). Although convoluted, the plot makes a sort of sense and via a few twists and turns, comes full circle at the end. I've bemoaned blockbuster SFX thrillers before but this franchise justifies any number of inferior copies and I for one hope that old Jason gets another knock on the head to go round all over again.",9,0,1,20 December 2007
Notting Hill," Good for Notting
","I'm sorry but I absolutely hated this sickly-sweet romantic comedy from the too-prolific pen of screenwriter Richard Curtis. It boasts, if that's the right word a wholly unbelievable plot about a mega-famous Hollywood actress (Anna Scott, played by Julia Roberts) escaping the trappings of stardom to naturally stumble into a London bookshop and promptly falling in love with its down-at-heel but of course down-to-earth and available mop-haired owner (played by who-else? Hugh Grant) and the ups and downs of their subsequent affair. Along for the ride are a motley crew of Grant's supposedly 'normal' friends including Gina McKee and Hugh Bonneville and kooky characters like Grant's fated-to-be-mated hippy-chick sister, played by Emma Chambers and his painfully unfunny gauche flatmate played by Rhys Ifans.By-passing the ridiculous plot, the film's dialogue is excruciatingly awkward and strives so hard to be everyday and natural but instead comes off as stilted and cringe-worthy. The humour is as thin as ribbon-pasta and the acting painful to watch, almost as if the cast was embarrassed speaking this forced, supposedly feel-good nonsense. The worst example is when Grant profanes the phrase 'Shittety Wicketty' at an exasperating moment, but there's plenty more dross where that came from.As for the playing, you can see everyone acting and a painful experience it is to witness. Mind you, you'd have to be Mary Berry to make writing as flat as this rise up. For good measure throw in a sappy soundtrack with Elvis Costello vacuously crooning the old Charles Aznavour hit 'She' and a song by the even worse Ronan Keating, to make my movie-hell complete, while the only happy thing for me about the so-predictable happy-ending is that it was the actual ending of the film.For a so-called romantic-comedy, I found it uninvolving, unamusing and ultimately unwatchable. I'd resort to sarcastic clichés to complete my hatchet job but fear the movie used them all up by itself.",1,12,31,29 December 2014
The Aviator," High flying bird
","Modern epic cinema of the highest order and proof that there's life in the old dog yet as Scorcese fashions a spectacular drama around the 'living years' of celebrated billionaire, inventor, recluse and all-round megalomaniac, Howard Hughes. In fact perhaps the only nondescript thing about the whole enterprise is the rather dull title, otherwise there's much to feast on here. Scorcese has shown himself at home with the milieu of America in the 30's and 40's (I'm thinking particularly of his in my opinion unjustly overlooked masterpiece, 'New York New York'), but here the drama is embellished by edge-of-your-seat special effects, especially the aerial ballet of the filming of 'Hell's Angels' to the judderingly realistic plane crash when Hughes personally takes up one of his prototype aircraft. At the heart of the whole is Leonardo De Caprio delivering a superb turn as the by turns electric then desolate Hughes driven on but eventually driven down by his inner demons. This is a performance of great maturity, as the Hughes character moves from the years 1926 - 1946 during which time he assumes the roles of gung-ho film director, billionaire playboy, maverick inventor, spendthrift magnate to his eventual succumbing to the madness of his obsessive behaviour disorder, manifested most of all in his obsession for cleanliness. The remainder of the ensemble is mostly fine, with Kate Beckinsale alluring and headstrong as Ava Gardener, Alex Baldwin formidable as Hughes' nemesis at Pan-Am, Juan Tryppe and Alan Alda (long time no see) just right as Tryppe's man-at-Congress, Senator Brewster who attempts to bring down Hughes at a post-war Senate hearing but gets bitten himself as Hughes turns the tables on him. Less satisfactory is Cate Blanchett in another of her true-life impersonations, not quite looking or sounding enough like Kate Hepburn to convince, difficult task as that is. Perhaps the film lionises Hughes a little too much as at times he was clearly an unsavoury, selfish and cruel person, which his illnesses can never fully excuse - consider the point, for example, too lightly made, that three stunt men died during the making of 'Hell's Angels', his WW1 flying epic or that his two 'triumphs', which bookend the film, the eventual release of 'Hell's Angels' after years in production and Hughes' successful piloting of the massive 'Spruce Goose' / 'Hercules' sea-plane on her test-flight, were Pyrrhic victories at best ('Hell's Angels', for all its box-office success, failed to recoup its huge production costs and the Hercules never made it into commercial production) and symptomatic of Hughes' delusions of grandeur. A man with his money and flair could have left far more lasting legacies than these and I don't think Scorcese makes that point (or even wished to), which is no doubt why we don't get to witness Hughes complete submission to his illness in his old age. Nevertheless this is a bravura piece of Hollywood mythologising with the veteran director expertly marshaling his massive resources in creating a wonderful movie that sweeps you into a whole other world and the not-quite 'beautiful mind' of a gifted but tragically flawed individual.",9,1,2,13 May 2008
Bohemian Rhapsody," Mercury rising and falling
","This two hour plus celebration of the flamboyant Queen front-man Freddie Mercury, chooses to put his music at the forefront of his brief and often troubled personal life and indeed ends at the scene of his greatest career triumph, to wit, Queen's day-stealing slot at the London setting for 1985's Live Aid set, even eclipsing R.E.O. Speedwagon in the process! So the movie starts and ends with the group doing their twenty minute Live Aid set, jumping back from their getting ready to go on stage to tell the singer's story in conventional format, from his days as a rebellious teenager in his parents' strictly religious Parsi household, to working as an airport baggage handler, where he is the object of casual racist comments to his fateful meeting with his band mates just as their lead singer walks out on them.Their story of struggling to get signed by a record label, internal group squabbling, finding success, more internal group squabbling, Freddie's key relationship with his muse and soul-mate, if not bed-mate, Mary Austin, yet more internal group squabbling, his mushrooming hedonistic, by now gay lifestyle although he never publicly came out unlike say, David Bowie or Elton John and yes, even more internal group squabbling before the band all kiss and make up in time to boost Bob Geldof's fund raising Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium.Naturally the soundtrack is peppered with any number of Queen classics which helps to gloss over the sometimes over-dramatised sequences in Mercury's life. Rami Malek never once looks like Freddie, at least from the front, although ironically the actors playing the other band members strike greater resemblances. Malek is credible as the troubled Mercury and is equally good in the musical set pieces, although I felt the Live Aid climax looked a little unconvincing at times.Nevertheless it was impossible not to enjoy the movie as a whole, despite its shortcomings, even if Freddie Mercury still maintains his enigmatic mystique once the movie has ended.",6,1,1,24 February 2019
The Bourne Identity," First Bourne
","The first in the successful Bourne franchise set the bar higher for future entries it has to be said. Matt Damon reinvented himself here as an action hero in the form of the title character, the first sight of whom we get is floating face down in a dark, stormy sea. He's not dead of course and recovers remarkably quickly from being shot so many times in the back, but once he does, he methodically works his way back to filling in his amnesiac memory as he finds out he's a broken-down killing machine who's now a liability to his employers.Along the way, inevitably of course, he joins forces with a girl (there's always a girl) of the feisty and rootless type naturally, who although only taking Bourne on initially as the most expensive taxi-hire in history, naturally develops feelings for him, even as all hell seems to break loose around him. From there to the end the race is on for Bourne to get his memory and identity back before the bad-good guys get him. Considering the number of sequels spawned to date, you can guess our guy doesn't exactly lose, although rather the same can't be said of some of his most ardent pursuers.What immediately set Bourne apart from other spy-action-hero types is that there are no gimmicks about him. The way that he comes across as an ordinary-average sort of guy (until you press his buttons) gets us on his side from the very start, our faith in him to come through as a good-guy in the end vindicated by the humanity he shows in his first would-be- assassination mission. More than that, the fast-cut action sequences are quite superb especially the expertly choreographed fight-scenes. The movie never slackens as it moves as relentlessly forward much like our hero's own mission to find himself.Damon is terrific in the title part and dominates the film. The direction keeps the tension going right to the end, interspersing the dynamic, stylised action sequences with just enough character-setting to fill in the backgrounds, without slowing the film to a halt.Even better was to come in the series but this excellent opener is more than just a 'curtains-up' on one of recent cinema's best characters, it's an excellent espionage thriller in its own right.",8,3,4,9 August 2015
Baby Driver," Spinning the wheel
","I'm not into the whole 'Gone In 60 Seconds' / 'The Fast And The Furious' franchises where the cars (or more particularly the driving and destruction of them) are the stars, but I took a chance on Edgar Wright's take on the brake and am glad I did.Focusing on the appropriately baby-faced title character (Ansel Elgort) from first to last and told from his own cockpit view, I actually wondered if he was going to perpetuate his initial Harpo Marx mute routine for the whole movie and was a little disappointed that he didn't. Where I did connect with him however was in his devotion to his iPod where he has a different one for different moods and can find his favourite track by spinning its wheel as quickly as he can the one in his car.Baby however has a lot on his plate, an orphan who unsurprisingly lost both his parents in a car crash, he now looks after his elderly deaf-mute black stepfather in a run-down apartment, appears to be under the control of criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey in his last major film role before his scandalous fall from grace) and then falls for a pretty waitress named Debora (Lily James) who shares his love for usually classic R 'n' B music.Into the mix are thrown Doc's flaky negative-Mission Impossible assembled crime gang members Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Elza Gonzales who all get to jive talk and play shoot-em-up with any number of rival gangsters and errant cops who cross their paths, but who ultimately come to their own sticky ends.With the action set-pieces neatly syncopated to a diverse soundtrack taking in obscure T Rex, early 70's Dutch Rock from Focus and Golden Earring as well as great soul-sides by Sam and Dave, Bob and Earl and Carla Thomas, ending of course on Simon and Garfunkel's title tune, the film is a breathless ride through a series of staged bank heists and of course car stunts where it's fair to say that many cars were damaged in the making of this movie. There was also a relieving dollop of comedy as you'd expect from director Wright in the crisp music-themed dialogue between Baby and Debora, the gang squabbling over which Mike Myers character mask to use when carrying out a robbery and Baby's gentleman-driver politeness which helps him ultimately to reduce his jail term and so reunite with Debs at the end.All the performances are good, with Hamm in particular surprisingly so as the deranged stockbroker-gunslinger and Elgort and James as the young Bonnie and Clyde-types.I actually watched this movie as an in-flight movie which probably isn't a bad way to see it. As well as helping my return home go quicker I also appreciate it saving me from ever dipping into any of the four-wheel stunt-fests like those mentioned at the start of this review.",7,1,2,14 December 2019
Justice League," And Justice League for all...
","I'm a big fan of the early Justice League (of America) DC comics of the early 60's, usually written by Gardner Fox and penned by Mike Sekowsky so this megabucks all-action SFX fest should have been right up my street. However I hadn't seen the preceding 'Batman / Superman' or 'Wonder Woman' movies and found I had a lot of exposition to catch up on, but I just about got there by the end.DC has been trailing Marvel, I think it's fair to say, in the movie stakes of late and even though in comicdom, the JLA predated the Avengers, obviously Marvel's two group blockbusters have stolen a lot of the prevailing thunder, both in terms of critical praise and box office success.I guess the big problem for DC is the perennial one, to paraphrase 'The Sound Of Music', how do you solve a problem like Superman. The Man Of Steel is so all-powerful that you know that any team he's on really can't lose even if the super-villain the rest of the Leaguers are up against can beat them all to a standstill. About that super-villain, a giant cross between Loki and Thor (he even wields a mighty hammer) called Steppenwolf (rumours that he was almost called Iron Butterfly are unfounded), I found him to be rather unconvincing, not to mention unintelligible at times as he blasts and blusters all over the place.And as for the individual Leaguers, well, of the newcomers, I didn't recognise the Cyborg character (wasn't he a Teen Titan?) and felt he had the least presence of anyone on the team. For me, his place should have been taken by Green Lantern, one of the original comic book characters - frustratingly we see fleetingly a member of the Lantern Corps in one of the massed battles with Steppenwolf and his Viking-like hordes. My favourite DC character of all is The Flash, now starring in his own long-running, very enjoyable TV series but here portrayed as a callow youth, just learning about his powers. He's used for much of the humour in the film but I prefer my Barry Allen to be older and more confident than this. Aquaman, king of Atlantis I almost didn't recognise as a long-haired, bearded, tattooed denizen of the deep who when it comes to the big battle scenes above water makes you wonder why he's there at all. Debate will continue as to whether Batman, a non-super-powered human even deserves his place on the team but Wonder Woman makes a big impression, being the group's second most powerful (behind Supes) and frankly best-looking individual.Of course there are SFX galore, possibly too much as sensory overload is almost achieved, but the story is relatively easy to understand and those scenes where the five, later six, get to pose heroically for truth, justice if not the American Way, against the skyline, get me every time.Markers are put down for sequels although I'd prefer the League in the future to fight against their individual, better known rivals, sort of a league of super villains but I hope the film does well enough to get the follow-up go-ahead otherwise its back the comics for me.Oh and I loved the tag of the old Superman / Flash who's the fastest, after the titles.",7,0,1,27 November 2017
Man of Steel," Stain-full Steel
","The most recent Superman reboot until the next one comes along, as it surely will, especially now that Henry Cavill has quit the title part. I'm old enough to remember the Christopher Reeve portrayal of old Supes and it was far more entertaining than this. Yet again, the viewer has to sit through another destruction of Krypton prologue with a big name actor in the part of Poppa Jor-El, who with his wife Lara send their newly born boy Kal-El to Earth where our yellow sun will give him 'super' powers, also another big-name couple playing Ma and Pa Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) during young Clark's boyhood, before the meat of the story appears, or rather reappears in the form of General Zod, a fellow Kryptonian exiled to the Phantom Zone for an attempted coup and murder of Jor-El. However the problem of pitting two super-humans against one other as the film's finale does make for a really boring match-off as they knock each other into the middle of next week, destroying buildings and cars by the score before an admittedly surprise code-breaking conclusion came literally as the end.The whole 'with great power comes great responsibility' schtick was really done to death as we're asked to believe that our hero would just let old Pa Kent sacrifice himself for the sake of keeping Clark's identity secret, as if life preservation wasn't our hero's chief modus operandi, at least the way I read the original comics.The SFX were just CGI overkill, not helped by Hans Zimmer's ear-bashing soundtrack. For me Cavill gave me nothing new in the titular role, despite his Mr Universe physique, likewise Amy Adams as a decidedly unsexy Lois Lane and Laurence Fishbourne in his P.C. turn as Perry White. Michael Shannon merely blustered as Zod, although I did think that Russell Crowe passably represented Jor-El although how he ended up getting more screen time after his demise really stretched artistic licence.With no Jimmy Olsen, Lana Lang or Lex Luther either, it did seem as if characterisation lost out out in favour of the old crash-bang-wallop of interminable fight sequences, indeed you knew you were in trouble early on the moment peace-loving scientist Jor-El makes like a ninja when he encounters Zod early on in the movie. There was zero humour either, no real pacing and very little engagement in the story-telling.Listen I know that a lot of success in comic and film adaptations in recent years has come from re-imagining the character's origin story but this one seemed boring and shed very little new light on old red and blue. By the finish, my eyes and ears were black and blue from the unwelcome sensory assault I encountered here.",3,2,3,7 June 2019
The Caine Mutiny," Bountiful mutiny
","Another of the films my father goes on about, so this one's for you, dad and while I can see why he reveres it so much, found some flaws in it which slightly lessened my admiration for it. Undoubtedly a brave film, with its implicit criticism of US Navy practices, the film of course has much wider points of view to posit on themes of heroism, duty and loyalty, but muddies its own waters along the way so that it misses some of its marks, rather like the Caine itself on some of its training exercises. The faults of the film as I see them are a rather unnecessary sub-plot on fresh-out-of-naval-college Ensign Keith's love-life, the insertion of perhaps just too much stock footage and the lack of motive shown by amateur philosopher-cum-doctor-cum-writer Fred McMurray, who to me seems miscast here in an it-doesn't-work against-type role as the cry- wolf Iago encouraging others to wrest Bogart's faltering Captain from duty on the grounds of what is called throughout 'paranoia', but what today we would recognise as battle- fatigue.Aptly, therefore, the film has delusions of Shakespearean grandeur in its plotting and characterisation and has at its heart a performance from Bogart that would grace any production of the Bard. He takes almost half an hour to make us entrance but dominates the action from then on with a marvellous twitchy performance which reminded me of no- one so much as tricky Richard Nixon. Van Johnson is excellent too as his usurper Maryk, but baby-faced Richard Francs as Keith lacks gravitas, Jose Ferrer is too showy as the defending solicitor who gives Queeg enough rope to hang himself while McMurray fails to resolve his character's moral contradictions by acting in the one sardonic key throughout.After the riveting trial scene, although itself is let down by the crude insertion of Queeg's glowing testimonial appraisal of Maryk which comes from nowhere, the film really founders as you detect the heavy hand of the Navy 'censor' on the tiller when firstly McMurray's Keefer weaselly drops in on the celebration of Maryk and Keith's 'Not Guilty' verdict, still failing to explain his motives but gets accepted by the guys and then Ferrer punctures the mood with a clumsy 'don't judge him too harshly' speech at once admonishing Queeg and indicting Keefer so that they might as well have re-run the pre-titles legend reminding us that the US Navy never has and by implication, never could countenance a mutiny.To some extent I can forgive the whitewash conclusion as a necessary sop to the authorities at the time (so that the movie could get made at all), but looked at today, the compromises seem excessive and blunt the moral message of the movie. That and some suspect failings in character motivation and development ultimately work to its demerit but looking past these failings and bolstered by Bogart's courageous playing of an accidental villain, there's still much to enjoy here.",7,1,1,12 November 2011
The Color of Money," Re-do The Hustle
","I deliberately watched this after 'The Hustler' and it probably didn't help my appreciation of 'The Color Of Money'. In fact I'd say that if the principals here were movie directors that only the been-there-and-lived-it Eddie Felson could have directed 'The Hustler', while it would take someone like a brash, flashy Vincent Lauria to come up with 'The Color Of Money'.There's lots of technique in Scorsese's feature with countless showy examples of imaginative editing and camera set-ups but the film is weak on story and characterisation and no amount of stylised high-end cinematography can mask or change that. The film really is a more of a homage to Newman who finally won his lead actor Oscar on his sixth nomination for his work here but the great man isn't much more than a show-horse.Cruise is okay as the young hustler Newman takes under his wing, all nervous energy and callowness but of course watching him work you're reminded of Newman's own performance when he was the new kid on the block twenty five years before and there's little comparison. Scorcese tries to work the women into the narrative but both Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Helen Shaver only come off as peripheral. Elsewhere, you'll see Iggy Pop in a pointless cameo which could only have been inserted for some wannabe street-cred.The soundtrack produced by Robbie Robertson, late of The Band, for whom Scorsese of course made 'The Last Waltz' ten years before, likewise comes over as incongruous and mannered with a blues-heavy selection of tunes and background music which again only heightens the artificiality of the overall film.There's no real emotional core or climax to the film and certainly not the tension that Robert Rossen created in black and white, in fact it seems to me that the narrative got lost somewhere in between some deliberately Oscar-baiting acting and show-off direction. I wanted to like this movie but it came across ultimately as empty and pointless.This was the second of Scorcese's two big-budget, high-profile remakes of classic black and white Hollywood features of the early 60's, the other being 'Cape Fear' but here again he comes off second best compared to the originals.A bit of a miscue all round for this one unfortunately.",4,0,1,11 December 2019
The Thing," It's your thing
","Sci-fi horror isn't really my thing but I did enjoy John Carpenter's stylish and exciting re-make of a 1950's Howard Hawks production (which I haven't seen). Sure the plot looks very familiar, Alien gone south, but the freezing climate and remote location of the Antarctic fit the 'nowhere to run' scenario just as well as the moon.After the arresting opening, which introduces the vastness of the frozen wasteland of the region as a helicopter for some reason chases a husky dog over miles and miles until it reaches the American scientific exploration base, the film settles into the again familiar 'and then there were none' plot line as the alien entity starts to prey on every living thing in the camp.The film benefits, in my opinion from its lack of major star-power, thus providing a more communal feel among the menaced men and making it harder to guess who, if anyone will still be standing at the end. The special make-up effects are absolutely terrific, making for many 'don't look now' moments. Carpenter keeps us in the dark, literally, as almost all the attack sequences take place to gloomy backdrops, aided in this by Ennio Morricone's brooding and atmospheric soundtrack. The acting is good, strong ensemble stuff, although some of the characters fir me lacked individuality. I'd also slightly criticise the ending as being inordinately stretched out and lacking the climactic finish I think the previous tension merited.Nevertheless this was at least as gripping and exciting as any of the 'Alien' movies I've seen, plus the similarly themed 'The Abyss'. In fact, make my aliens bloodthirsty rather than cuddly any day of the week.",7,0,2,19 June 2012
21," Casino boogie
","Hard to believe this movie was based on a factual story, given the improbabilities in the narrative, but this was still an enjoyable caper film, colourfully set in Las Vegas, centring on a youthful team of blackjack players out to clean up in Sun City, under Tge tutelage of their college master, ex-player Kevin Spacey.Putting aside how a runaway swindler like Spacey could find himself ensconced as an esteemed mathematics professor at Harvard, recruiting his team from students in his class, he and his young crew raid Vegas every weekend building up their 'winnings' until dissent in the ranks upsets the gravy train in its tracks.The action centres on nerdy but normal , played by Jim although one of the problems for me was that too much happens to him. By the time we've reached the predictable twist at the end, a lot if the dramatic tension has been dissipated with each succeeding development as it affects Jim.Of course it's tricky to make blackjack gripping on the big screen and despite some clever time-lapse photography, with the threat from the security team lacking menace and too many loose strands in Jim!'s. The acting is okay amongst the younger set, but Spacey isn't really stretched here, plus his character disappears for a significant period before making the unlikely decision to return with his acolytes to Vegas for one last hit.Running about half an hour too long, considering the slightness of the story, even the sights of Vegas itself couldn't adequately fill the gap. However, I was just about intrigued enough by the story to see it through to the end",6,0,0,4 January 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Deathly dark...
","I have read the book but obviously have only come to this first part of the film dramatisation rather late in the day. Not a bad thing actually as it reduces the book-to-film comparison it's very easy to fall into. Thus I found myself watching it almost afresh and was able to watch it as a film first rather than an adaptation.That said, I did find it slow in parts yet conversely haphazard in some of the no out essential editing to get the required halfway point of what is a very long and detailed novel. This method rather exposes the acting skills of the young leads and while they've come in a bit since the early adventures, I still don't think they can quite carry the movie off on their own shoulders. The action sequences are much darker and scarier than before but probably too far apart to really have the maximum effect. In between we get a lot of scenes in the dark, on the woods, by a loch and in a tent, where we're meant to get caught up in an imaginary triangle between Harry, Ron and Hermione. There's no Hogwarts, the Express train or even Hagrid's Cottage and also very little in the way of experienced support to relieve the lack of dramatic tension too.This accent on melodrama reaches its nadir with the death of Dobbie in a terribly overblown 'Little Nell' type scene. From there we don't even get a cliff-hanging climax to propel us onto the sequel, which while I will watch it soon, will I think be more satisfying as it reaches its conclusion. This did look to me very like half a film but with more vigorous editing could have ended up better than it did, at least in my eyes.",6,0,0,13 July 2012
North by Northwest," Roger and out
","Talk about your change of pace. After making the dark, disturbing masterpiece that was 'Vertigo' the year before, Hitchcock decided for his next trick to lighten proceedings with the playful and sophisticated 'North By Northwest'. For those who criticise the Master for only making the one type of movie, these two consecutive movies show that while ostensibly staying within the thriller genre, it's possible to extend your range and capabilities as a director without turning wholesale to period drama or sci-fi. Put it another way, they aren't two films to watch in a double feature. Which is the better of the two, well that depends on whether you prefer Mozart over Beethoven. Or do as I do and split the difference.Just like 'Vertigo', 'North By Northwest' starts with a dazzling title-credits sequence, courtesy again of Saul Bass, combined with a superb theme, once again from Bernard Herrman. Then the fun really begins as we're introduced to the affable 'Mad Man', Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, a handsome, middle-aged, snazzily-dressed advertising executive, twice divorced and if truth be told, with a bit of a mother complex. By innocently raising his hand during a meeting with clients at a swank New York hotel, just when a call goes out for an individual named George Kaplan, he is immediately swept up in an espionage plot concerning the secret exporting of state secrets to an unnamed foreign Cold War power.At the heart of these nefarious activities is the wealthy businessman Phillip Vandamm played with elan by James Mason who has in tow with him a number of besuited henchmen to do his bidding, particularly his right-hand man played with adoring devotion by Martin Landau as well as having a beautiful mistress on his arm, another classic Hitchcock blonde, this time Eva Marie Saint.The action moves along smoothly and easily, helped by sparkling, sometimes risqué dialogue especially between Grant and Saint and incorporating some of Hitchcock's most memorable set-piece sequences, especially of course the attack on Grant in the middle of nowhere by a cropduster plane and the vertigo-inducing climax atop Mount Rushmore.It's not only Hitchcock but all of his top-listed cast who are on top of their game here. Grant, still impossibly handsome in his mid-50s and wearing a suit better than anyone ever could, Saint sexy and sexually confident but with just an air of vulnerability in her compromised position, Mason coolly urbane, with a sinister edge and Landau as his homo-erotic bodyguard. Great also to see past Hitchcock supporting actors like Leo G. Carroll and Jesse Royce Landis on board for the ride with prominent parts.'North by Northwest' brought Hitchcock to the end of the 50s, a decade where he had created a run of mostly outstanding features. As such it can be said to be the icing on the most sumptuous of cinematic cakes.",9,1,1,29 December 2019
The Shining," Shining brightly
","With only a couple of caveats, it's entirely justified that Kubrick's 'The Shining' be lauded as one of the most frightening horror films ever made. More on those deterrents later, but there's no doubt the film is a technical masterpiece in its use of sets, lighting, colour and sound to create an increasingly more terrifying atmosphere as the film reaches its conclusion.What Kubrick does brilliantly is subvert the stereotypes of the horror genre, so that instead of a darkened claustrophobic atmosphere, he gives us a vast brightly lit hotel for the Torrance family to be moved around in while his ghosts aren't shadowy phantoms but vividly drawn presences.Only at key moments does Kubrick stop the constant movement of front and back-tracking camera-shots, notably in depicting Nicholson's Torrance character's conversion to madness and his grisly death by exposure to the snow overnight. Otherwise, we get the wonderful device of the steadicam following young Danny's buggy as it wheels around the hotel corridor, the remarkable shot of the sea of blood pouring from the elevators, the eerie lighting used in the chase sequence in the maze, but the best shot is when Nichoson gazes down at a model of the house maze which cuts to a an extreme long-shot of his wife (played by Shelley Duvall) and son, lost in the real-life maze.It certainly gripped me from the start but there were odd scenes which defied explanation, such as the pin-up pictures of black women in Scatman Crothers' character's home, Nicholson miraculously escaping from a locked room after conversing with a 'ghost' and Duvall's ever stranger visions as she escapes out of the hotel near the end.I must say though that I do agree with the original writer Stephen King's opinion of the casting of the leads. I've never been a fan of over-actor Jack Nicholson (his 'Here's Johnny' scene, far from being terrifying strikes me as hilariously over the top) while Shelley Duvall as either wife or mother seems like an even bigger mis-casting, which is an understatement compared to the usage of Scatman Crothers as another 'shiner' who makes an unlikely attempt to save the day, or should that be night.For all that though, 'The Shining' is a bravura work, injecting new life into an old genre, thoroughly out DePalma-ing DePalma along the way. Oh, and don't watch alone as I mistakenly did tonight!",8,0,2,17 February 2013
"I, Robot"," Amateur Robotics?
","Entertaining big-budget sci-fi, light on philosophy, heavy on SFX and none the worse for that. Adapting Asimov's famous book and then putting Will Smith right in the middle of it, well, what would you expect...? Making wisecracks a-plenty as if he's only just moved out of Bel-Air, you just know this is going to pay as much attention to its source material as latter day Bond features to Fleming's original novels, but putting that admittedly major caveat aside this is good quality latter day Hollywood blockbuster film-making which ticks all the buttons you'd expect it to. Smith is likable in his 'Men In Black' / 'Independence Day' reprise and enters fully into his blue-screen persona. The story is reasonably intelligent and told at a furious pace, stopping only occasionally for some mild debate on the whole free-will issue before careering on into the next action set-piece. The computer graphic enhanced sets of Futureworld are impressive as are the depictions of the army of robots which rise up against their makers and the interaction of the humans comes off well most of the time, although some shots (for example Smith on his motorbike) are less successfully realised. The dialogue is okay, automatic at times, and perhaps lacking in snappy one-liners to take your mind off the story's adapting to film mores of the new Millennium. All in all a movie to sit with a big box of popcorn alongside,(if you can look past the fairly blatant product placement - and no, my next car will not be an Audi!), glory in the big car chase and the various fight sequences - in fact in that sense maybe's it's not so far removed from those blissfully innocent 50's sci-fi entertainments like 'The Day The World Stood Still' or the original 'War of The Worlds'. In that sense 'I Robot' is perhaps a minor achievement after all.",7,1,1,27 February 2008
Wanted," Bullets over (and under and sideways) Broadway
","I'm not familiar with the source comic book but after two hours of this blockbuster I'll not be subscribing anytime soon. I know that films like this aren't really aimed at my age-group, but when done really well ('The Matrix', Avengers Assemble') even I can get it.The movie starts with a bloody bang, literally, as we're introduced to the main trick employed throughout, a slow-motion bending bullet, something we've already seen before in 'The Matrix', and which gets done to death (no pun intended) as the movie progresses. If I was trying to be positive, I could say it's fast-moving, flashy and expensive-looking. It's much easier though to say it's relentless, trashy and ultimately empty. I didn't like the constant profanity, I felt the blood and guts gore was overdone and the sex scenes, whilst brief and usually involving 'worm-that turns' James McAvoy's boorish, bullying so-called best friend banging his girl-friend, crude and gratuitous. There's precious little leavening humour, the body count is massive and accelerates as the finish approaches plus I vaguely mind seeing good actors like McAvoy and Morgan Freeman wasting and hardly extending themselves in easy pay-days like this.McAvoy as the central character undergoes the biggest metamorphosis since Dr Jeckyll drank his potion, going from put-upon office nerd to a pumped-up killing machine who even gets to snog fellow-agent Angelina Jolie along the way. There's a biggish plot-twist of the Luke Skywalker variety and a massive SFX episode involving a train crash but for me the latter wasn't as big as the movie itself from which I found myself derailed very early on and never climbed back on board again.",3,1,3,27 April 2015
Salt," Assaults the senses
","Jason Bourne in skirts. This loud, frenetic actioner surrounding a nasty Russian plot (new Cold War story-lines are back in again, it seems) to use 'sleeper' agents to bump off the President and trigger a war, the plot obviously dreamt up just at the time when real-life Russian agents were being exposed in the States. But what approximated to topicality at the time just seems ridiculously far-fetched now.Besides the Bourne comparison above, there are elements of Bond, Die Hard Mission Impossible and 'Taken' undoubtedly hoping a little of their franchise magic might catch on (It seems 'Salt 2' is on the way), but other than putting a woman in the lead role I don't see anything really distinctively different here to that seen previously in the examples I mention above.So, inevitably, we get a pounding, headache-inducing James Newton-Howard soundtrack, impossible stunts, none more than Jolie's truck-hopping display early on, twist after twist as the ridiculously contrived plot hurtles to its conclusion and a final last-gasp save, just as you'd expect.The acting throughout is perfunctory, the characters imbued with as much depth and personality as computer game ciphers. Jolie is certainly athletic and gets to run and jump a lot but in the end this only serves to remind us of her previous incarnation as Lara Croft.In the final summary, with its mis-calculated new Cold War rhetoric and mindless action sequences, this is really just a movie that wants really to be a computer game, in fact I'm only surprised that unlike 'Tomb Raider', the game, on this occasion, didn't come first.",3,0,3,26 April 2013
Edward Scissorhands," Cut above
","Tim Burton here cleverly gives us a modern fairytale with a twist combining the dark with the light in this conflation of the classic Frankenstein and Pinocchio tales taking some barbed shots at mid-60's American suburbia along the way.Framed within the timeless 'Once Upon A Time' and 'They lived (un)happily ever after' narrative is a beautifully realised story of the strange boy who came to stay, in this case Johnny Depp's title character, who up until now appears to have lived unnoticed by everyone with his scientist creator Vincent Price in their unobtrusive (!) castle abode just out of town. For some reason having given his creation sets of scissors (as opposed to say a hook or stump) for hands until the real things are ready, Price unfortunately for both expires just as he's about to replace them for Edward.And so it is, that after a quiet day touting for doorstep business, persevering Avon lady Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) espies the castle and decides to try her luck there, where she encounters Edward and with her gormless husband Alan Arkin, promptly adopts the young Goth with blades for digits. It's not long however before Edward's growing local celebrity, especially once he displays his wonderful topiary skills, brings him all sorts of unwelcome attention, particularly from Kathy Baker's sex-starved neighbour (surely a prototype for Peg in the classic 90's sit-com 'Married With Children') and the jealous lunkhead, beefcake boyfriend of the Boggs' pretty cheerleader-type daughter played by Wynona Ryder.Unsurprisingly Burton duly brings the rain with a less than happy ending for the three youngsters in the love triangle but not before he's poked some fun at small-town Americana with its under-the-surface jealousies, bible-bashing proclivities, underlying prejudice and sexual repressiveness all exposed to view, with a nice satire of daytime TV thrown in too.The film is a visual delight with Burton mixing heavy gloom Gothic with day-glo sunshine. Depp is excellent in another of the notable misfit roles he regularly seemed to play at this early stage of his career, Ryder is fine as the love interest, Wiest, Arkin and particularly Baker as the tolerated town trollop are very good in their grown-up parts and I particularly appreciated the aged Price's cameo as the for-once not so evil inventor.Sort of like the kind of film Frank Capra might have directed after waking up with a nightmare after watching 'The Wizard Of Oz' the night before, Burton has created an enduring holiday classic and an early highlight in his long career.",8,0,1,18 December 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Ringing the same old mission bells...
","I don't watch the MI franchise anymore to make a connection with what was one of my favourite TV programmes growing up. I still like it though when a subtle or sometimes not so subtle reference comes into view but let's face it, I might as well be watching the latest Bourne or Bond for all the difference between these big spy-thriller franchises.Like Bond or Bourne, it will start with some jaw-droppingly stunning rescue or escape sequence to act as a prelude to the main film which then reveals itself as usually some fiendishly cunning plan by some mad scientist / megalomaniac which sees the team end up in interesting or exotic locations to resolve even if at times it seems impossible, before the big fake-out at the end puts the world back to normal.Things I liked about this entry; the fast-segment sequence over the still great theme music with scenes you never remember having seen when they eventually arrive in the actual film, the way the age-old 'Your mission, should you decide to accept it' introduction sequence was turned on its head, the tried and tested use of masks for masquerade purposes plus some of the stunts were exciting, including the plane-hitching scene-setter, and Ethan's underwater raiding of a security vault. I also liked Jeremy Renner's character in the film and the neat trap sprung on Mr Big which saved the day.Things I liked less, Simon Pegg's Benjy is starting to grate on me, there was yet another high-speed car chase, this time pitting two wheels against four which had a seen-it-all-before air to it plus of course Tom Cruise as ever runs fit to burst his Fitbit.Don't get me wrong it was fine to disengage my brain for a couple of hours but I still think the great great TV show of my youth would have been better served by a cogent TV rather than cinematic reboot.",6,1,1,16 January 2018
Shrek Forever After," Second rate Shrek
","A shame to see what was once so original, both in terms of graphic representation and slick but sharp comedic chops reduced to this really rather tawdry, hopefully 'final chapter' as its US title would have it, in the Shrek franchise.It's only 90 minutes long but seems greatly padded out, with a plot that fatally and unoriginally owes more to 'It's A Wonderful Life' crossed with 'Harry Potter' than the toon world which inspired the original prototype.It's basically all plot and almost no laughs, only one line - Donkey's 'Time-share' quip - broke my silence, nothing is added to our knowledge or empathy with the characters and you couldn't care less about the denouement. There's nothing new in the art department, ditto the use of soundtrack music, in fact the whole thing reeks of formula and cash-in.Time to retire the big guy and all his entourage. When the inevitable Christmas boxed set hits the shelves, this is the one you'll never play more than once.",3,0,1,27 December 2010
Dunkirk," On the beach
","In which Christopher Nolan attempts to do a Spielberg in widening his palette to take in a major war-themed movie a la 'Schindler'. Does he succeed, well, I don't think so. Nolan has spoken about the unusual construction of his film, taking three stories on the day, one being two young soldiers' desperate attempt to escape the carnage on the beach over the course of a week, the RAF pilots attempting to protect the air-space over the Channel within one hour and the crew of a small private boat in one day making their own way to try to help relieve the situation and then sort of sort of slow / fast forwards them all on from there, cutting from one to the next in triangular order, from start to finish. These switches, I have to say, I grew almost irritated at by the end, to the point of anticipating them even at key dramatic points in the story.I guess his big idea was that rather than attempt a massive-scale over-arching narrative of the events at Dunkirk, he attempts to tell the tale with just these three microcosms and infuse them with the different human traits at play in such a desperate situation. Thus we see the young soldiers on the run from the start displaying fear, selfishness, ingenuity but yes, even cowardice as they try anything to get aboard a leaving ship, only to end up threatened with drowning in an abandoned boat they'd hoped to commandeer and use to get to safety. With the pilots, we witness calmness, bravery, loyalty, flying skills and ultimately self-sacrifice as they fight overwhelming odds in the air while in the rescuing private boat, again we see endeavour, courage and compassion as the crew of one middle aged man and two young boys attempts to make a difference by saving as many as they can.Was this approach the best way to convey the big picture here...I'm not convinced it was. Some of the incidents seemed contrived and at odds with the realism sought for elsewhere, especially the incidents of the young cabin boy on the small cruiser and the French soldier who ends up with a bunch of hardly heroic British soldiers under deck, trying to escape drowning.Sure, the depiction of the terrible ordeals they each went through is realistically portrayed, on water, land and sea, but ultimately it lacks the realism of say 'Saving Private Ryan', (sacrificed obviously for the 12a classification to no doubt ensure younger viewers could get to see it), so there's no blood or bits of bodies as you would otherwise expect. I'm not sure I saw even one German in the whole movie. There's very little dialogue either so there wasn't much room for acting skills to shine other than by reacting mostly with British pluck to events, which actors like Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance can do all day while Tom Hardy is confined almost exclusively to the cockpit of his Spitfire. The best I can say about pop star Harry Styles' acting debut was that I didn't even notice him until my wife pointed him out to me in a scene right at the end.Commendably, Nolan keeps his film to a 105 minute duration when it would have been easy to bloat it to double that length, but in the end, I didn't feel at any stage that I was actually witnessing real events, always that I was watching a movie, which for me, as I say, makes it ultimately a failure. The miracle of Dunkirk was that 300000 got home safely under insuperable odds, whereas here it seemed as if barely 300 made it. Mr Nolan should turn his telescope around.",5,30,54,22 July 2017
Cross of Iron," Rugged Cross
","My dad has been at me for years to watch this Sam Peckinpah movie and I've always resisted, never being a particular fan of either war movies or Peckinpah, but finally caved in to his exhortation and I'm glad I did. I'm aware of the film's troubled production history and it's true you can almost see where the money ran out, but what's left is still a memorable treatise on the hell of war.Set during the German Army campaign in Russia, James Coburn is Corporal, later Sergeant Steiner, a maverick but fearless platoon leader of his own 'wild bunch' of men. No respecter of rank or class, he accepts war for the bloody playground that it is, his nonchalance and insolence compensated by his individual bravery and military brilliance so that his unconventional actions are tolerated and indeed overlooked by his perceptive high command Colonel Brandt, played by James Mason.Onto the scene however comes a glory-hunting, Prussian, Nazi Officer, Captain Stransky, played by Maximilian Schell who craves as his own personal badge of honour, the Iron Cross, which Steiner already has, but who wants to take the shortest and safest route to get it. This opportunity arrives quickly for him as he seeks to take the credit for a heroic offensive actually led by another captain who conveniently for Stransky, dies in the process. To get his Iron Cross, however, he needs Steiner to corroborate his invented bravery, setting the two men at odds with each other. Later at a key point in the movie, Stransky conveniently abandons Steiner and his men on the front-line, expecting them to perish and with it the one obstacle to his own vanity project.With ever more brutal individual episodes, taking in Steiner's platoon co-opting a Russian boy-soldier into Steiner's troop then encountering a group of Russian female soldiers and the climactic final scenes where Steiner miraculously leads his men back to their own lines only for Stransky to cold-bloodedly order them to be fired on, the film ends with Steiner and Stransky meeting face to face for their own Butch and Sundance closing scene.Peckinpah is in his element with the military hardware, explosives, man (and woman and child) - power at his command and delivers a compelling study of class, courage and honour in the heat of battle featuring his familiar trademarks of blood and gore and slow-motion 'dance of death' choreography/photography.Balancing his ultra-real but stylised action sequences with credible individual characterisations, Peckinpah comes up with a highly individual but often brilliant war movie. Coburn is magnificent as the laconic rebel Steiner and is counterpointed well by Schell's strutting career officer. Mason too is excellent as the presiding, battle-weary colonel while David Warner as his jaded captain acts as the conscience of the film.I get that with Peckinpah you either love or hate his over-the-top excess but it's naturally suited to a war setting and while he has certainly here left behind a film with many memorable images, scenes and performances, they are always at the service of the story and message at its heart.",8,1,1,20 May 2020
Ratatouille," Rat in mi kitchen
","This has to be one of Pixar's finest and funniest features to date. While even now,I struggle to get my head fully around enjoying a film where a kitchen is invaded by rats to the extent that they at one point prepare and serve all the food in a top restaurant, even my natural hygienic revulsion was overcome in the end. What next, a playful killer shark with ideas on how to boost tourism at a holiday resort or a friendly viper who helps weed the garden...?Anyway, the setting of Paris gives the studio the chance to, in more ways than one, broaden its horizons, with new, funny characterisations, French locations and also interiors, from a five-star restaurant and its working kitchen to Linguini's shabby (later luxurious) Eiffel Tower-facing apartment. The storytelling skill and joke-count are as high as ever, but for me it's the detail in the art-work which impresses most.Of course, being an animated feature, means that the director can take a shot from any vantage point, but even so I was frequently surprised by the sheer audacity of some of the set-ups and edits which certainly kept me interested and helped the movie negotiate its sometimes tricky dual-plot line format. The film at first seems to reach a natural ending prematurely with the initial success of Linguini (and Remy) so that the coda of their having to convert the sternest critic in Paris could have seemed contrived and padded but the single scene where he's won over is probably the best in the movie and justifies the extra half-hour for the more muted but still happy ending.I'm normally not a fan of celebrity voice-overs in cartoon films (give the work to jobbing actors!) but even I enjoyed Peter O'Toole's star turn as the glacial critic who turns, but in truth he's no better than the rest of the cast in giving life to their pixilated creations. Being a Disney film, of course there has to be an element of playing to the young and so we get the usual sub-plot pitting a sort of bad-guy head-chef against our hero and the usual pick-and-mix of uplifting morals for all, but it's none too blatant and never a distraction.In short, this was a highly entertaining family feature, although I personally pity the parents of young children who on seeing this film will be pestered to buy them a pet rat for their birthday or Christmas!",8,0,2,7 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Along comes a new spider
","There really should be a time-limit on re-boots, in my opinion. I get that Spider Man is probably the best known Marvel Comics character and that this was their own reclaiming of him under their own banner, but I enjoyed the Raimi and McGuire tilt at old Spidey and didn't think that this re-make, despite some obvious changes, completely wiped away its too recent predecessors.I'm no expert on the comics front but the main changes I saw here were a different girl-friend for Peter Parker in the form of Gwen Stacey, played by Emma Stone, a different villain in The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) and no J Jonah Jameson or anything to do with the Daily Bugle. Otherwise it's the same old same old with another origin sequence, bullying scenes with Flash, the noble death of old Uncle Ben and another metamorphosing super-villain imperilling New York City.I did like Andrew Garfield, incidentally a double for tennis player Andy Murray, who plays a different kind of geek in Peter Parker than Tobey McGuire. He convincingly looks young enough in the part and I enjoyed the repartee his Spidey has with the villains he battles and the familiar wall-hanging poses he adopts throughout, just like the comics I remember. Gwen Stacey dresses a little oddly for a trainee scientist in knee-high socks and boots but Emma Stone acquits herself well as the hero's girlfriend who coincidentally is the daughter of the police chief (Denis Leary), who wouldn't you know it, despite the evidence of his own eyes and countless witnesses still can't differentiate do-gooder Spider Man from the evil Lizard.The SFX were excellent, especially all the web-slinging and web-swinging, with the big fight sequence at the end taking us all the way back to 'King Kong' as a reference point. But was it better than the first Sam Raimi take on the character? The box-office returns would suggest not. I'll look out for the sequel from 2014, but wouldn't you know it, there's another re-boot around the corner later this year in 'Spider Man Homecoming'.Careful you don't squash this particular spider with your (re)boot Marvel.",6,0,1,17 April 2017
Control," Joyless revision
","I'm not greatly into the whole Joy Division / New Order musical trip, finding the music too grim and never forgiving the Nazi-chic of their deliberately chosen band names. Plus I remember at the time reading in the music press of the day the legend 'Ian Curtis died for you' and dismissing it as sheer hyperbole. After watching this movie, I still don't believe the latter but do have a better knowledge of the man behind the myth as well as a better appreciation of the band's music.Unsurprisingly shot in black and white by the celebrated monochromatic rock photographer Anton Corbijn (later associated with his iconic images of Depeche Mode and especially U2), the film is thus rendered bleak and grey, the proper background for the depressed Manchester and Macclesfield locations that were the backdrop to Curtis's life as well, of course as his turbulent life and the group's doomy, powerful music.The movie eschews the traditional celebration of the rising success of the group to the extent you're hardly aware of their popularity at all. All the way through, Curtis lives in run- down houses and freely moves in everyday locations with hardly admission of his growing celebrity and increasing musical significance. Instead, the film concentrates on his epileptic illness and growing surliness together with his relationships with the two women with whom he had lasting, if difficult relationships, his wife Deborah and his lover, Belgian Embassy attache Annik.I struggled somewhat with the relentlessly downbeat insight into Curtis's life and at times struggled to see how he could attract the attention of the two women who struggle for his attention. A largely absent and disinterested father and husband he cheats on his wife and yet returns to her, lacking the courage to do the honourable thing and move on to let her live her own life. In the end, his depression at his personal conflict, his debilitating illness, addled by his medication and drinking leads him to his final act of self-destruction and of course the debate as to whether this was a heroic or cowardly act.If lacking life and drama (and humour) in the story-telling, there's no questioning the power of the band's music and the recreation of Curtis's hood-eyed, 'lost control' whiplash dancing style by Sam Riley is spot on. The acting in support was solid, with an empathetic performance by Samantha Moore as the long-suffering wife and in particular, though relegated to the sidelines, the actors paying the individual Joy Division band members, who as well as looking the part, also convincingly recreate their emotive music.Curtis's story is certainly one worth re-telling given his posthumous elevation to post-punk icon by the music press in the UK in particular. That said, the film didn't exactly move me and never seemed to really get under the skin of its subject, which given the prior knowledge of the inevitable conclusion, lends a slow-motion car-crash perspective to the story's progression.No film about the artist's life here was ever going to be a joyous and uplifting experience, but Corbijn largely treats his subject with sympathy if little real insight. In the end Curtis remains an elusive subject , which may just have been the point of the film in the first place.",6,0,1,9 August 2012
Now You See Me," Smoke and mirrors
","Caught this as an in-flight movie which is probably the best way to watch it I'd think. It's loud, flashy and trashy with about as much depth as an empty crisp packet with lots of big stunts and a try-and-keep-up shape-shifting story-line.Four very different magicians, later to be termed the Four Horsemen, are brought together by a mysterious supremo to contrive a high profile, 'impossible' robbery of a French bank somehow coordinated from their Las Vegas stage-show with a Robin Hood touch of distributing the proceeds to their grateful audience. On their tail is cliché-cop FBI agent Mark Ruffalo, dishevelled, maverick, mildly sexist, you know, the stubbly, tie-needs-straightened type, always apparently three steps behind the criminal gang and a specially assigned, equally stereotypical ice-maiden French Interpol agent whose detective instincts outshine her boorish colleague. From there it's a harum-scarum catch-as-catch-can race onto set-piece number two in New Orleans before climaxing in a predictable big-finish in New York, where all is revealed including the identity of the controlling Mr Big.As for the acting, Michael Caine gets another of his blustering, needless cameos, Morgan Freeman is even more improbably cast as a TV star magician-buster trying to catch up with the group. Ruffalo blusters along gamely however, Woody Harrelson is the leery elder-statesman of the four and I liked the three other younger team-members too.Of course it's all unbelievable nonsense, with a predictable car-chase, martial arts fighting and from-nowhere romance between the seemingly unmatched cops but if like me you go for out-size magic stunts and an outlandishly twisty-turny story, it will happily eat up two hours of your flight time as it did mine.",5,0,0,8 March 2017
Gandhi," Workmanlike biography of India's great religious leader
","I'm relatively unfamiliar with the history of Mahatma Gandhi's lifelong struggle to liberate India from the yoke of British colonialism and have since learned that this biopic plays somewhat fast and loose with the historical events and characters (particularly Nehru and Jinnah) along the way. That said, it's still an ambitious and admirable piece of film-making by Richard Attenborough even if not, in my opinion ultimately quite deserving of all the accolades it received at the time of its release. The cinematography is of the highest standard (eat your hearts out Merchant Ivory), the crowd scenes superbly handled and of course centring it all is Ben Kingsley's performance as the beating heart of the movie, moving the events forward as he matures from an idealistic young lawyer first learning to turn the other cheek of passive protest in turn of the century apartheid South Africa to later take on the stubborn remnants of the fading British Empire in his homeland to achieve his desired aim of independence just after the second world war. Perhaps a weakness of the film is that we only ever seem to get Gandhi's viewpoint of things, so that any contrary view to his is somehow demeaned and found wanting. This can't be right when one thinks of the conviction politics at play here particularly the religious differences which caused the India / Pakistan divide. There's also a possibly unavoidable tendency to sanctify Gandhi as he delivers homily, after edict, after platitude - he surely can't have been right all the time...and there's a bit of underpowered dynamism at key parts of the narrative. There also seems to me to be a little too much croney-ism in some of the casting although it was certainly a brave move to cast the little known Kingsley in the lead part. You could argue that the director's low-key approach better serves its serious purpose rather than a more Hollywood-type hyperbolic exaggeration but remembering that this is a movie entertainment and not a documentary, I still felt the malaise. The sheer length of the piece (even with intermission) again mitigates against the drama although again director Attenborough, obviously in thrall to his subject, possibly didn't want to short change Gandhi with just a two hour potted biography. All through this review in fact I'm apologising for the director, perhaps subconsciously venerating the subject matter too much myself. Gandhi's place in history however is secure and Attenborough's noble but slightly stolid film does nothing to detract from that. Whether the life of a religious leader or politician lends itself to great movie art is however debatable and 'Gandhi' for me doesn't quite deliver enough as a film to convince me one way or the other.",6,0,2,26 March 2008
Jackie," Jackie Woe
","This up-close-and-personal movie wasn't the conventional bio-pic my wife and I were expecting to see. Instead it focuses only on the key moments in the married life of Jackie Kennedy, ex-First Lady of the USA taking as its obvious fulcrum the assassination of JFK by her side on November 22nd 1963 in Dallas.The narrative employs a well-used Hollywood framing device, that of an interviewing reporter writing a post-assassination article on her, which allows the grieving widow to speak out loud her struggles to handle her own grief, break the news to their two young children, fight for her husband's legacy and determination to live on, even after having to leave the White House with her family under such awful circumstances - in one scene we see her in the White House, even before her husband's funeral witnessing Ladybird Johnson unfeelingly picking out new drapes for when she moves in.Elsewhere, the movie mixes long-range archive footage of the real President and Jackie with jump-cuts to the modern day actors, sometimes shot in sympathetic blurry-TV black and white. Similarly, the non-linear narrative mixes in other pivotal events during her time as the president's wife, most notably the TV special in 1961 where she gives a guided tour of the refurbished White House interiors she personally oversaw, but also her being made to stand next to LBJ in her blood-spattered clothes while he's being sworn in on Airforce One and her determined walk to the Arlington Cemetery from the White House for the funeral. Interestingly, we don't get to see the famous moment when their young son walks up to his slain father's coffin and salutes it.Less a history lesson than a study in grief, Natalie Portman delivers a tour-de-force performance in the title role. She's in virtually every scene, most often in extensive close-up and convincingly portrays the different emotions Jackie Kennedy must have gone through on the day, from shock, through grief, to determination. Although she interacts most with Robert Kennedy (played by an actor who looks and sounds nothing like the original) while organising the funeral what comes through most is her sense of alone-ness as she drifts zombie-like through the seemingly cavernous White House, playing the record of the contemporary musical 'Camelot' in the background as she struggles to keep herself together.That said, it is a slow film and it can be awkward for the viewer to look in on such private trauma, plus there's a graphically horrific recreation of the moment of her husband's death. I also felt the background music was far too funereal and overbearing in the extreme. Nevertheless it's worth seeing for Portman's remarkable performance even if ultimately the film itself suffers from its narrowness and over-intensity.",5,0,1,4 February 2017
Inside Out," It Never Entered My Mind
","I don't know but sometimes I felt as if I needed a degree in psychology to fully join up the thought processes which not only went together to create this acclaimed Disney / Pixar movie but also that went on inside the mind of the animated young girl Riley at the centre of the action.Ambitious it certainly was, attempting the fine balance which all Pixar films strive to achieve between providing the cartoon fun beloved of young children and the sophistication demanded of the adult who more than likely has to accompany their child to the movie. I don't know if the five key emotions identified and depicted here of joy, sadness, disgust, fear and anger would be the ones I'd identify as primary to a pre-teen child, and once joy and sadness exited their main functions, struggled a little to explain some of the motivations choices made by the three remaining, competing feelings.Again maybe it's me but I also didn't quite follow either the journey of the two dominant emotions back to the central cortex as it were and wondered a little if some of the characters they met along the way weren't just inserted for promotional tie-in purposes. I'd also argue that every child experiences a different mind-set as they grow up and didn't accept the applied generalised psychoanalysis here.Okay, maybe all this means that cynicism would be one of the guiding traits in my own mind but even in the wider picture the film didn't really reach out to me in the usual Pixar manner in terms of humour or emotion. There were occasional humorous but not hilarious moments and certainly some lovely and lively animation to see but for me it all went a little above my head leaving my mind-set at the end in neutral.",5,1,3,13 April 2020
The Duchess," A Duchess's progress
","Just another bodice-ripping costume drama...? Well, perhaps, but this latest entrant into a historically crowded field has such a strong narrative (based on a true story, so the legend has it), that taking into account the customary high production values this type of film usually engenders, the final result is a quality movie, with contemporary resonance as issues of child access, infidelity, class division, male-dominated relationship issues and a little bit of celebrity populism and more are presented for our delectation.The high-society-at-play opening on the lawns of England is merely the entrée to the more serious sport of class politics as aspirant mother Charlotte Rampling thrusts her innocently ambitious 17 year old daughter Keira Knightley into an arranged marriage with the older, colder Duke of Devonshire, old dour-face Ralph Fiennes, rich beyond belief and a major power in contemporary Whig politics whose sole expectation of his new bride is to sire a son to prolong his family line.Knightley's and to a lesser extent Fiennes' characters' stormy progress from this starting point to a sort of understood peace at the end is effectively the story in a nutshell, taking in, as it does, the affairs of subsidiary characters who cross their paths, like the Duchess's soul-mate, Lady Bess who will go to any lengths, including the bedroom, to win the Duke's influence in getting her infant sons returned to her from her in-possession separated husband and aspirant young politician, later Prime Minister, Charles Gray, the Duchess's ardent admirer from her youth who remains her passion in adulthood plus other contemporary historical figures like Whig Prime Minister Fox and Restoration playwright Sheridan, always making appearances at some grand ball or somesuch. The point where Knightley's character realises she must make the same sacrifice for her children's welfare that she decried her friend earlier in the piece is the nexus of the film.Knightley is very good as the young ingénue who learns the hard way, despite a native intelligence, just how little prepared she is for her deep-end entry into the man's world of Regency England. Fiennes' journey of self-exploration is shorter, but hints at the later concessions society would make to legitimate feminine demands in marriage as well as society as a whole. Interior and exterior shots are beautifully set and lit. Many shots are well-composed including variations on the almost clichéd long-table shot of breakfasting husband and wife not communicating with each other. Ditto the costumes and particularly the extravagant hair-do's of the women of the day! I did however find the background music not always redolent of the era and so all-embracing that you often got the impression that a string quartet was playing just off-camera in almost every scene. Too much of a good thing.A bitter-sweet tale then of female/motherly sacrifice which ends, rightly, on the side of the angels.",7,0,0,16 August 2009
Yesterday," While My Guitar Gently Sleeps
","Listen, I'm a huge Beatles fan and have been since I was a boy, so I really wanted to love this film. That said, I have found Richard Curtis's film screenplays in the past to be too sentimental and slight and I'm afraid this homage to the music of the Beatles found me in familiar territory again, even if it was directed by Danny Boyle.The basic idea of struggling musician Himesh Patel wakening up after an accident to find he's (almost) the only person who knows the songs of the Fab Four makes for an interesting concept and Curtis gets some good little jokes in referencing some of the group's famous song titles. However when he brings in Ed Sheeran, about whose music I know practically nothing, for one of the biggest cameo roles you'll probably ever see a real life celebrity make in pictures, then gets Patel involved with a cliched portrayal of a high-powered American female manager and worst of all, tries to weave a love story between Patel and long-time roadie / agent Lily James, it starts to flounder and go nowhere, pretty slowly.I also didn't get the reason for the other random examples of world history and culture (Coca Cola, Harry Potter) dropping out of the timeline although I did like that in this alternative universe, John Lennon got to live well into his old age, but why not George Harrison too, who only got to 59 himself. I was expecting more humour too, remembering that Curtis co-wrote two of the funniest ever British TV comedies, 'Black Adder' and 'The Vicar Of Dibley', although I appreciate those were many years ago.Of course I enjoyed hearing the many Beatles songs which naturally proliferate the soundtrack even if I thought the material chosen was a bit Paul-heavy.Overall though, I found it a bit overlong, lacking in punch and without a really strong narrative, all descriptions that rarely applied to the songs of the Beatles the film was trying to commemorate.",4,3,7,27 October 2019
Quantum of Solace," Home, James...
","As cold and soulless as a computer game, this is Bond still struggling to keep up with Jason Bourne. So we get a bazillion stunts and SFX, ditto body count and changes of location, likewise plot twists. It all goes by in a whirr, exciting for the merest second, but gone the next, leaving no real feeling of enjoyment or even exhilaration.Daniel Craig probably uses less words of dialogue than any previous Bond and demonstrates little finesse. Yes, he's a superbly sculpted killing machine, but somewhere along the way, the writers and director forgot to give him a personality, humour or even wit which effectively turns him into a Terminator-type, grunting like Arnie and therefore impossible to like or admire. That may have been the intention, given that the basic story here is one (or rather, two) of revenge, so much so that green Oligarch Greene's machinations in South America seem like a sub-plot.Some of the stunts are stunning, but with others you can see the C-Gen joins. With only one genuinely breath-taking moment in it, the 'Goldfinger'-update death of Agent Fields, the rest is just relentless, senses-numbing 'action'. No one has to act much plus I think Judi Dench's M role is getting built up far too much in latter-day Bonds. This brutal, ice-hearted Bond I see here isn't one I readily recognise or particularly enjoy. Two films into the Bond re-boot and already I suspect a cross-roads ahead...",5,10,14,8 April 2011
The Dirty Dozen," Lee majors...
","No pretensions at art here, this was a contrived, unbelievable, but ultimately very entertaining war movie. Following the multi-star cast approach of 'The Great Escape' and 'The Magnificent Seven', we get the naturally elongated running time, as much to allow us to familiarise ourselves with the individual characters as anything else.There were aspects of the plotting and pacing I didn't take to though, especially the borderline psychotic character Telly Savalas is asked to play, a misogynist racist. I can only guess he was in there to show social awareness for the then current civil rights movement in his spats with Jim Brown, but why make him a woman-hater (and killer) too? I also felt too much time was put on the pre-amble where the dozen bond together at the expense of a miscast Robert Ryan as a pompous general. And I also took exception to the wanton slaughter of women in the Nazi stronghold cellar - yes, war is hell and all that, but such butchery brought the Americans almost down to the level of the Germans, especially when there was little in the film demonstrating the savagery of the Nazis, even if I'm not naive enough to not be aware of their barbarism during the war itself.On the positive side, most of the casting is excellent, my only other carp being the inclusion if singer Trini Lopez who wouldn't you know gets to strum a guitar and sing at one juncture. Of the rest, Lee Marvin is excellent as the granite-hard maverick major, John Cassavetes is fine as the recalcitrant Franko and Charles Bronson delivers another effectively stoic performance.The climax is suitably tense and action-packed, although I might have wished for the sequence to be extended at the expense of some of what went before, but for mindless, action-filled war entertainment, this was good stuff.",7,1,2,26 February 2012
Gone with the Wind," Winds of war
","The fact that as at my time of writing, 'Gone With The Wind' stands only at number 152 in the best movie rankings of this site, I hope might be mainly attributable to the relative youth of the posters here. Here surely is Golden Age Hollywood's lasting monument to itself, which like another big-subject civil war movie from a previous generation (D W Griffiths' 'Birth Of A Nation') while politically flawed in its treatment of black people, nevertheless stands as a significant and magnificent piece of movie-making.It's a film I'd dearly love to see on the big screen but all my viewings of it so far have been on TV which can't begin to do justice to the scale and colour of the achievement here. I know there's some contention about who directed which parts of it but I'm going to give my kudos to Victor Fleming who I believe did the lion's share of the work behind the camera. The sets are magnificent and the set-pieces even more so with several jaw-dropping scenes which are testament to artistic imagination and technical achievement in equal measure. Of course the two most celebrated of these I suppose are Rhett Butler's rescue of Melanie, Scarlett and Missy just ahead of the burning edifices of Atlanta and the rising dolly-shot of the wounded and dead of the Confederate Army as Scarlett seeks out Dr Meade. But let's not forget the acting too, especially the two leads who are both terrific, Gable, in his greatest role, is mean, moody and magnificent, while Vivien Leigh in her Hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as the wild, wilful and wonderful Scarlett O'Hara. While the characters of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes seem almost too good to be true (Ashley's guilty feelings for Scarlett aside), they are nonetheless beautifully played by Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland. Hattie McDaniel belies the racial stereotyping of her Mammy character to deliver an unforgettable, often scene-stealing performance. It is difficult today to witness some of the political incorrectness of the treatment given to the black characters, in the main shown as subservient, excitable and slow-witted, not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds in the film (Big Sam saves Scarlett from being raped, while Mammy effectively acts as the conscience of the film) and it is dreadful for modern ears to hear the 'd' word spoken so casually if only sparingly.However I'm not going to criticise the movie for that when there's so much good to praise. It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one. It's been many times said and written that 1939 was probably the year that more great movies came out of Hollywood than any other, but this one outdoes them all. And most other films since, come to that...",9,12,18,20 September 2015
Mamma Mia!," ABBA palaver
","The surprise smash hit musical of its year, sweeping up a bunch of hit songs by ABBA who'd split and last recorded as a group in 1982 into a slight if sunny musical set on a picturesque Greek island.The plot could have been written on the back of one of the envelopes sent by the betrothed young daughter of Meryl Streep on the eve of her wedding to her mum's three summer-nights (oops, wrong musical) romances twenty odd years before, any one of whom could have been her father. Also on the island for the big day are Streep 's two ex-girl group singers and just to keep the three theme going, daughter Sophia's two girl-friends are there too. Much flirtation, confusion, indignation, reconciliation and elation duly follow accompanied of course by almost every ABBA song you can think of shoehorned into helping the plot along.I couldn't bring myself to dislike it, even if the plot had more cheese than Gorgonzola and the acting more ham than Denmark. The singing by the leads is mixed in quality with Meryl Streep surprisingly good and Pierce Brosnan unsurprisingly not so good.This feelgood harmless piece of fluff I guess did me no harm and made me feel okay even if it omitted highlighting some of ABBA's best songs like 'Name Of The Game', 'Knowing Me Knowing You' and 'Summernight City' while I could have done without hearing some of their worst like 'I Do I Do I Do I Do', 'I Have A Dream' and 'Thank You For The Music'.But that was always ABBA for you, sometimes brilliant sometimes terrible and I suppose the best I could say about this film was that it was neither brilliant or terrible.",5,1,1,18 October 2018
Batman Begins," Rebirth of the Bat
","The temptation not to say tendency to portray iconic fictional heroes (moreso comic-book characters) in a light over-humorous manner, running eventually to campness is something that has afflicted franchises like James Bond and Superman, but especially Batman. The only benefit of this is that there is usually a revolt into style, a return to a back to basics outlook which serves the character best. I am a reasonably big comic-book fan, especially the DC range, although I 'grew out' of the habit in the late 70's with my own adulthood, thus missing the revolutionary approach to the Batman character by Frank Miller in the Dark Knight / Year One series but did my homework here by reading them before watching Christopher Nolan's revisionary movie on old Bats. Both, I have to say were quite exhilarating and I might advise that anyone still to see the movie read the comic first as it definitely improved my enjoyment as well as updating notable reference points I'd forgotten about. To the movie itself then. To mix metaphors by borrowing a comic-book-cliché, this is a real page-turning watch, skilfully mixing characterisation with action to a background setting of the decadent corrupt Gotham City, itself almost a character in its depiction as a bleak industrial monolith, if stopping short of Tim Burton's Gothic vision of the 80's. It takes a full hour before the Batman uniform (make that armour) is donned by Christian Bale, yet you don't feel cheated by this. Bruce Wayne's journey to his alter-ego is gradual and believable, played out to a background of exposition as characters such as good-cop Jim Gordon, Assistant DA Rachel Dawes, boffin Lucius Fox and faithful butler Alfred are filled in for us. Of the twin-villain menace, Nolan has arguably picked out two slightly lesser-known members of Batman's Rogues' Gallery, Ras Al Ghul and Scarecrow, but makes both work by imbuing the former with the old master-pupil dichotomy and the latter with a terrifying reality-distorting persona, which ironically Batman also taps into to frighten the criminal fraternity without the use of hallucinogenic drugs. The acting is of a high order, without irony and while there are humorous one-liners scattered about, these are terse and don't distract from the overall bleakness which Batman is seeking to banish. Christian Bale is excellent in the title role, even if he doesn't at first automatically suggest Bruce Wayne in appearance. He gets heavyweight support from the likes of Liam Neeson as Ras and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, but I found Michael Caine a distraction as Alfred, too big for the part. Katie Holmes acquits herself well as crusading DA Rachel and Gary Oldman is also fine as the one good cop Gordon. The fight sequences, if occasionally gloomy and blurry, are mostly effective, the action sequences, particularly the customary race-against-time conclusion excitingly rendered and the music (by perennials Hans Zimmer and James Newton-Howard) is well-placed and adds atmosphere. I especially liked the sequence of Joe Chill's assassination, which brought to mind the real-life 'TV' killing of Lee Harvey Oswald while at another point, I almost detected a homage to of all things Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video. Very hard to carp then with this re-telling of a familiar tale and the teaser introduction of The Joker's calling-card at the end will satisfy traditionalists keen for Grade A villainy. I certainly welcome sequels if they're in the hands of the original director and hope Nolan bales out at the right time before the descent into cartoon-land becomes too evident.",8,0,0,2 January 2009
Bridesmaids," Bridesmaids revisited
","In my defence I didn't get 'The Hangover' either, the brother to the sister here. This, for me, was an overlong, only occasionally amusing modern comedy peopled with that contrasting combination of weird and supposedly normal people, put into supposed comedic situations by a bachelorette party staged for a prospective bride. Thus we get the creepily strange fat couple that rooms with Kristen Wiig's Annie and the even more overweight (the bigger the waistline, the stranger the persona appears to be the rule here) groom's sister with a penchant for puppy dogs and a flair for picking-out air-marshals on plane-flights who attempts to bond with Wiig at her lowest ebb. The story, if I can call it that, is told from Wiig's point of view and starts immediately with her engaging in casual sex with a guy who kicks her out of bed by morning and to whom she's no better than his number three shag. Some humour does emerge as she gets into a bidding competition at the engagement party of her best friend's Maya Randolph's new best-friend, the super-rich, super beautiful Helen, well-played by Rose Byrne but after that the humour gets scatological at a posh bridal-wear shop, drunken on board an aborted plane flight to Vegas and finally kooky and at times surreal encounter with an off-beat cop with whom she makes an unlikely connection. Of course it all ends up happily at the wedding, her best-friend credentials to the bride re- established as they belt out Wilson Phillips' feminist anthem 'Hold On' and she gets reunited with her cop but by then the laugh count had dropped even more. I'm vaguely aware that this strain of humour mixing gross, crazy people with so-called normals is all the rage - I've not even mentioned Jill Clayburgh as Wiig's, yes you guessed it, wigged-out mother, or some of the other bridesmaids who drop out of the picture after an hour or so, but this slacker humour just doesn't float my boat, especially when it runs way beyond 2 hours in the telling.",3,7,11,27 December 2011
Meet the Fockers," Family sagger!
","I haven't seen the original ('Meet The Family') and so came to all these characters afresh, which I appreciate probably wasn't the case for most of its viewers. On the strength of this, would I go back and watch its predecessor, well, maybe...This movie is a strange mix of the infantile and mildly prurient, the producers possibly hoping that the mix comes together with a 'family movie' at its centre although for me I saw the swings between these two extremes as far too obvious, not to say crude. I mean all that stuff about Barbra Streisand's sex-therapy teachings, humping pets and De Niro's artificial boob, plus the not-even-funny-the-first-time play on words on the title family's name.Of the big star talent on show, I actually liked Hoffman and Streisand's turns as Stiller's touchy-feely (and then some!) parents, both having a romp with their crazy characters. Unfortunately De Niro (like Meryl Streep) only really has one comedic mode, the same grizzly sourpuss he initiated in 'Analyze This' - you suspect that Hoffman could have played his part but not the other way round. Stiller straight-mans it for all he's worth - he's a likable enough actor, as is his hapless character, but even without knowing much about his other screen roles, he seems to be in the same comedic typecast cul-de-sac of the likes of Jim Carrey or worse Adam Sandler.The narrative is paper-thin and seems to move along a plot-line of placing each character in the most embarrassing situation, usually with sexual connotations) especially Stiller's. And, sorry, movies which rely on babies or pets (or both) for cheap laughs just don't work for me.No, Hoffman and Streisand apart, this movie barely left an impression on me and thankfully Ben doesn't seem to have seen fit to add another sequel to this particular series, thus sparing us the likes of Al Pacino and Julie Andrews as a psychopathic uncle and prim and proper aunt...",4,2,3,15 December 2009
1941," Army and Navy snore
","At the time he made this colossal turkey, Steven Spielberg was the new wunderkind on the block and after the massive successes of 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters...', it seemed he couldn't miss. Armed with a massive budget (and trust me, you can see every dollar spent on the screen), with pet writer Robert Zemeckis on scripting duties he must have thought he couldn't go wrong. Unfortunately it's more a case of what could go right in this unfunny monument to excess, so bad is it, in fact, that the director has never attempted a full-out comedy ever since.The premise of a rogue Japanese submarine, unaccountably with a German staff officer on board too, invading Hollywood is dumb, while the side by side, I hesitate to call them stories of a bullying tough-guy soldier terrorising a young jitterbugging couple, an out-of-his-box fighter pilot seeking a dog-fight every time he gets in the cockpit and lastly the misadventures of a frigid beauty who only gets turned on when in the vicinity of a plane are hackneyed and infantile. The U.S. teenage magazine 'Mad' I think had to be an inspiration for this mess, hardly the basis for screen comedy (c.f. 'Howard The Duck').There are no characters worthy of the description in the entire movie, no central person to follow and most importantly no worthwhile jokes to make the viewer smile, never mind laugh. Spielberg's idea of the punch-line to a scene is to offer up a cast of thousands and a lot of bangs, crashes and explosions.With mediocre acting too, this really is a plane-crash of a movie, once seen, instantly forgotten, as unfunny a comedy as the later 'Pearl Harbour', on a similar subject was an unintentionally funny drama, these two wrongs not making a right!War really is hell, as the saying goes - ditto this awfully bad movie.",1,4,6,30 November 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Back to the future
","I am such a fan of the original 60's TV series and am aware that many like-minded die- hards are down on Tom Cruise's take on it, promoting his star-power fit to burst where the original was all about the team and of course inserting ever-more hair-raising and unbelievable stunts which never featured previously. I see and get both those arguments and can't imagine for a second Cruise's at times almost superhuman Ethan Hunt fitting in alongside Peter Graves, Martin Landau et al from before, but while I still prefer the relative ingenuity and complexity of the TV version, I did at least feel that this newest instalment drew more on the original inspiration than others in the series, which I think benefited the entertainment here.Yes, it's still all about Ethan, motivated by the apparent murder of his wife and his incarceration in a foreign prison, but touches like him getting his instructions the old- fashioned way, by self-destructing taped messages, re-using Lalo Schifrin's relatively unadorned theme music and the familiar and warming catch- phrases of old as well as his break-out from the prison and the team's first task at the Kremlin, hint back at the gravitas of the TV show although with the two subsequent exotic relocations to Dubai and India we're back in wonderland with out-of-this-world stunts atop the world's highest building and an extended fight between Hunt and megamind Hendrycks in an an automated car-park. While mind-boggling and white-knuckle inducing, these set-pieces find our hero doing the literally impossible, the usual one-handed grab to save himself falling off the high-building, taking an impossibly long breath to escape drowning and lastly having his body thrown about like a rag-doll in the final sequence as he finally saves the day.There's no denying Cruise's charisma and his physical conditioning in the part. I wasn't particularly taken with the quality of his back-up team, but that could be down to the writers bigging-up the star role, plus I still find Simon Pegg's 'Barney' role irritating and misplaced. I also never really felt that the villain had enough menace or stature to really challenge Hunt, especially during the climactic fight, but on the whole, I was almost won over by this latest IMF outing and yes, would welcome a succeeding instalment, the likelihood of which was strongly implied at the conclusion.",7,1,2,11 October 2012
Revolutionary Road," Bitter-sweet suburbia
","Of course the last time Leo and Kate made a film together, they played youthful star- crossed lovers in a doomed relationship. Here, they are older and altogether disenchanted, although again the outcome is doomed. The former of course was 'Titanic', for me an overblown, badly-written melodrama but here we have a warts and all examination of a stale marriage set in mid-50's 'I like Ike' suburban USA, based on a modern literary classic. The special effects are certainly better in the film about the ship but I know which I prefer.The film is an up close study of a marriage going wrong. On the face of it this youngish couple should be happy, like their neighbours seem to be. They have a nice house, he has a steady job, they have two kids and are considered the perfect couple. But like the song says, in every dream home a heartache and so it proves.After dissecting the modern American marriage to a degree in 'American Beauty'', Sam Jaafe (Winslet's husband at the time) gets the scalpel out again for this movie set some 50 years before. Some aspects however, whilst I appreciate they are in the original novel, don't work for me, in particular the introduction of the recently institutionalised son of an older neighbourly couple, who is there to point out the flaws in the Wheeler marriage which we presumably somehow mssed in the preceding hour. Add to that he uses some downright abhorrent phrases that only repel rather than enlighten with his parents saying nary a word against him.I also feel De Caprio is miscast here. He looks too baby-faced for the part of the treacherous husband but Winslet does well as the frustrated wife who can only find release from her straitjacket with the most extreme of solutions. Nevertheless the film has a gathering power as it builds up to its desperate climax and makes for strong, sobering viewing.",7,0,0,10 April 2013
Legend," Hardy and Hardy
","Let's start with the title...of all the films I've seen with irrelevant and inappropriate titles, this one takes the biscuit and I'm sorry, I didn't find the film legendary either. British cinema's continuing fascination with the notorious (now there's a better one-word title!) Kray Twins continues and I doubt this will be the last one either. The twist here of course is having Tom Hardy play both parts, thanks to some clever editing and video trickery, although with Reggie and Ronnie not at any time looking like the identical twins in the movie, you sort of wonder what was the point.I liked half of Hardy's performances. His Reggie was fine, a criminal who falls in love with an innocent, pretty young girl and wants to be the perfect husband to her but can't resist the lure of power that running his London empire or his misguided loyalty to his more thuggish, slow-witted brother, Ronnie. I personally found his second portrayal of the lumbering other brother to be exaggerated and bordering into caricature. The film tries to tell its story through the eyes of Reggie Kray's young wife Frances who commits suicide only weeks into their marriage, seemingly unable to cope with her new husband's unwillingness to give up the trappings of his ill-gotten success, although I am aware that her family today strongly disagrees with the passivity and helplessness she exhibits here, claiming in her defence her feistiness and even bravery in leaving Kray so soon after their wedding and then quickly deliberately overdosing rather than be dragged back into Kray's orbit. This seemed to me to be an unsuccessful attempt to humanise the Krays particularly as it seems to be at least part of the justification of Reggie Kray's seemingly out-of-character frenzied killing of Jack 'The Hat' McVitie.I also found the film to be selective of other events in their well-known story and a certain lack of continuity in the narrative, with the use of 60's music to define the era being haphazard at best (for example Herman's Hermits' 1964 UK number 1 hit 'I'm Into Something Good' plays while Reggie is nicked while watching the World Cup Final which took place in the summer of 1966 - the Kinks' 'Sunny Afternoon' would have fit better, surely).Quibbling apart, the film just rambled on, with little dramatic tension or driving narrative. It would have benefited greatly from tighter editing and a more focused storyline in my opinion and in the end seemed to rely far too much on Hardy to carry the film on his two pair of shoulders. However what really let the film down as indicated for me were the writing, the pacing and a distinct lack of edginess I think that any film dealing with the Krays needs to address. Clever casting gimmickry can't compensate for those.",4,15,20,2 January 2016
The Little Mermaid," Swimmingly good
","Credited with really starting Disney's animated Renaissance, my wife was determined to make me watch this with her over the festive holiday. How could I resist?Adapted from the Hans Christian Anderson fairytale, it's excellent family entertainment, with a suitably sympathetic pair of young lovers at the heart of its story, a disagreeably bad villain in the guise of the wicked witch of the sea and a fine soundtrack of catchy songs perfectly in simpatico with the plot.Of course the under-the-sea settings with its exotic creatures give the animators plenty of scope for colour, imagination and flair and they don't let us down. I wasn't sure the story required that Ariel actually lose her voice for a significant period of time, but if it's in the original story (and I haven't checked) then fair enough, I suppose.There's nothing earth-shatteringly original in this movie which looks backward to Disney's glorious fairy-tale legacy of youthful innocence being corrupted by some evil menace going all the way back to Snow White, but modernised as here with some good jokes and today's music, it happily updates the studio's legacy and of course set the path for the great successes the studio and its PIXAR affiliate has enjoyed ever since.",7,1,1,29 December 2016
Behind The Candelabra," Ivory Tower
","This uncompromising backstage dramatisation of the turbulent relationship between celebrity pianist Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson was a compelling watch. As I watched it, it took a little time for me to get over the sight of Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, two celebrated uber-masculine action heroes playing such camp characters plus their over-familiarity as stars if anything detracts from identification with their parts here but the fact that both absolutely throw themselves into their roles saw them convince me in the end.Liberace in real-life conducted himself as a family favourite, particularly with his female audience, playing popular piano pieces in cabaret and projecting a debonair if very camp image, on and off-stage, owning the inevitable L.A. mansion, with a grand piano in every room, innumerable fancy cars and of course his elaborate rhinestone-heavy stage costumes. Behind this facade however was a ruthless businessman, determined to preserve his self-image (woe betide the publication which levelled charges of homosexuality at him), in addition a controlling and sexually voracious individual who attended male-only brothels, watched hard-core gay porn and groomed young male wannabes into becoming his latest playmate. Douglas is excellent at portraying his character's at the same time compelling but repellant nature, flaunting his squeaky-clean image in public while living a life of decadent sleaze after hours.Into his orbit comes a young blonde bisexual country boy called Scott Thorson who very soon supersedes Liberace's then live-in boyfriend, attracted by the older man's charm, riches and power until too late he realises that he's being made over in his lover-employer's image and developing a drug addiction in the process. The power struggle between the two is fascinating to watch even if it is of course heavily slanted in Liberace's favour. The question here really is did Liberace corrupt and waste a young innocent's life or was Thorson a willing participant in the gravy train, happy to go along with it from the start.Director Siderburgh I think tends to the former viewpoint, although it's clear that Thorson is no angel himself. On the other hand, Liberace too is no one-dimensional character and it is the older man who calls up the younger as he nears his end from AIDS, fondly remembering their earlier happy times.I like this ambivalence, allowing the viewer to come to their own judgement on this particular lifestyle of the rich and famous. No corner is cut in exhibiting the pianist's excessive lifestyle although I was grateful that the love scenes between the two, although not ignored, was toned down somewhat for easier consumption. The acting is excellent, especially by the two big-name leads while Rob Lowe steals his scenes with a centre- parting like the Red Sea as a creepy plastic surgeon.I'm not surprised this film received so many Emmy plaudits and commend the director and cast for taking on a tricky subject and delivering such compelling viewing.",7,1,3,30 December 2015
Gone Girl," Real gone
","Hate to burst the bubble (IMDb top 250, average mark over 8), but I just didn't get this David Fincher thriller at all. With its combination of unsavoury lead characters, jaundiced view of television reporting and fantastical plotting, I found it unengaging, unbelievable and I'm sure many more 'un's' I could think of if I put my mind to it.I'm guessing the main theme here could be the unravelling of a modern marriage in the face of the recession but no, on consideration it just seems like another study by director Fincher of a psychopath. Just what the movies need today. Nothing is credible here, the relationship between brother and sister, the husband's casual attitude towards his wife's unexplained disappearance, his revealed-out-of-nowhere fling with one of his class students, the wife's misadventure with trailer-park trash, her jilted high-school lover-become-Howard Hughes who gets a poor reward for his admittedly somewhat possessive assistance to her at time of need (seems to me she should have gone after the two who rolled her at the caravan park rather than her ill-fated worshipper). If you're wondering how these random sounding events link together, then, even after watching the movie, so am I. It takes forever to reach a conclusive act of bloody violence which even then isn't worth the wait.As for the acting, it was no big deal. Ben Affleck looks and acts like a slobbish Hugh Grant and to be honest does so with about as much depth as the Englishman. Rosamund Pike wants us to think she's a latter-day Hitchcock mystery-blonde but she can keep wanting. Almost the only things I liked about the film were Trent Raznor's atmospheric soundscapes in the background and the fluid camera-work throughout.Otherwise, for me this was a major disappointment and demonstrated no real progress in the genre by this 'name' director going back to 'Se7en'. The emperor's new clothes methinks.",3,10,17,11 January 2015
Frozen," Nice cold
","Yet another sumptuous PIxar animated feature and the first in a long time to actually be an adaptation of a classic fairy tale (Hans Christian Anderson's 'The Snow Queen'). With a catchy soundtrack, witty and amusing dialogue and excellent artwork, this is one of the best latter-day Disney's and was deserving of its runaway (or should that be skateaway?) box-office success.Young Queen Anna's ice-throwing powers are very-well illustrated by the animators on top of their usual mastery of movement, background and facial expressions. The songs come at you a bit like a snowstorm, thick and fast, but they are always apropos the plot and invariably stirring and moving (the soundtrack album topped the US Billboard album chart for weeks on original release, which must say something about the standard of composition).Sure, the big-eyed, idealised forms of the human characters arguably overdoes the 'cute factor' but it's not as if Pixar is going to abandon the formula which has brought it so much success from 'Toy Story' onwards. I actually thought, about a third of the way into the movie, that the story was going to be carried wholly by 'human' characters with no talking animals, in fact there was a nice spoof on this early in the film with Kristof having an amusing ventriloquist-type conversation with himself and his faithful reindeer Sven, but of course, the introduction of talking multi-part snowman Alf just couldn't be resisted. Funny as he is, I suspect commercial considerations aimed at the infant 'want-that-toy' market were at work.Also predictable was the introduction of a bad-guy protagonist just to reinforce Disney's perennial need for a whole 'good versus evil' battle, but again, this time the quarter from where this arises was unexpected and seemed forced. In films of this type, I think it's better if the baddie is identifiable from the start rather than slipped in under the viewer's nose as occurs here. And while I'm carping, couldn't a better film title have been employed too, I mean I know they seem to like snappy one-word titles (c.f. 'Up', 'Brave' et. al) but what was wrong with tributing Anderson's source story properly?Anyway, I did enjoy the film, there was lots of pithy and funny dialogue, the songs were varied and amusing and by the end, my heart of ice was probably melted, but while I would say it was one of the better Pixar productions, I wouldn't rate it as the very best. Maybe the inevitable sequel ('Deeper Frozen' anyone?) will rectify some of the minor failings I detected here.",7,2,6,23 November 2014
The Lives of Others," How the other half lived...
","A marvellous feature, completely drawing the viewer into the gray, grubby world of state surveillance employed in the East German state prior to the collapse of Communism in 1989. The movie portrays the emotional journey of a cold hearted Stasi officer, played brilliantly by the late Ulrich Muhe, ruthlessly efficient in spying and interrogation techniques, who finds that his latest operation, the scrutiny of a suspected rebel playwright and his actress wife, unexpectedly humanises him to the point where he turns against his masters but not before tragedy befalls the couple. The recreation of the soul-less streets of mid 80's East Berlin seems entirely life-like, where every day bland state-sponsored TV attempts to neutralise individual expression of its citizens in a way that George Orwell only imagined some 40 years earlier. The ensemble acting is excellent, especially Muhe in the key role of the worm that turns, his face moving from an emotion-less blank canvas to anguished self-loathing as he transfers allegiance at the film's low-key but marvellously effective climax. All told, you really do feel that this is a slice of life you're watching and not fiction, my only gripe might be the that the writer could perhaps have made his point better by taking as the central subjects a more mundane couple than the slightly rarified examples of a distinguished writer and his famous actress wife. But for a sentiment-free picture of the de-humanising impact of Soviet Bloc tyranny this film is an important and ultimately uplifting testament.",9,1,2,11 November 2007
P.S. I Love You," Postal traumatic stress
","Friday night is movie night in our house and so my wife pipes up to say that she's found a nice movie for us to watch together. It's a modern day romantic comedy, although probably with more of the former than the latter, set at least partly in New York, where we happily spent our twentieth wedding anniversary last year and it even starts at Christmas time, ditto. I recognise the title as that of a fairly recent best selling novel written by the daughter of the then Irish President if I remember rightly so with all this to process I think I pretty much knew what to expect.After starting with a deliberately unconvincing lovers' tiff, amorously resolved of course, the movie shifts gear briefly as we're suddenly brought up to date and transported to the funeral wake of the garrulous musicianly Irish husband. Unsurprisingly, the wife goes to pieces, not going out, locking herself away from her mother, sister and brother in law and her two best girlfriends and generally living like a slob.Somehow her deceased husband has anticipated all this and to get her back into circulation has set up an itinerary for her, starting every new season over the next year, gradually revealing his well laid plans to her in the form of cryptic letters mailed to her, her family and friends which see her end up going out with her girlies to a gay bar and then further afield to his native Ireland where they first met (cue extended flashback!). In the background there's a faithful barman who's always had a crush on her but you know it's really just a matter of time before her heart comes out of the fridge and she resolves all her outstanding issues with her friends, mother and even her late husband by the end. Near the end I actually thought it was going to subvert convention with something less than a happy ending but of course I'm proved wrong within about 60 seconds.So, a sort of Irish variation of 'Ghost' then, but with a less consistent soundtrack (it's all downhill after the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl's 'Fairtytale Of New York'), less laughs but more cloying sentimentality.It's all pleasant, undemanding stuff, but at over two hours, outstays its welcome. Hilary Swank is nice enough as the reclusive Holly, I must admit I was surprised in a good way at Gerard Butler in comedic mode with tagged-on Irish accent and Lisa Kudrow reprises her kooky Phoebe persona from 'Friends' one more time as one of the friends (no pun intended). What else can I say, the Irish Tourist Board must have been happy at the depicted landscapes but I'm struggling to say much more.At least my wife enjoyed it.",3,1,1,1 December 2018
Good Will Hunting," Goodish Will Hunting
","I'm aware of the significance of this movie in bringing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to prominence not only as actors but as screenwriters and watched it with a degree of expectation. However the story of Damon's rebellious, tortured working-class genius flowering in the rarefied hot-house atmosphere of Boston's Harvard University didn't quite engage me, despite some good acting.The story is implausible in the extreme, as Damon's gifted character shyly but deliberately puts himself forward to get noticed by answering a difficult mathematical problem on display in the halls of the university and then follows his difficult progress to self- awareness which he ultimately achieves through encountering burn-out been there-done that psychologist Robin Williams and a pretty but feisty Anglophile student, played by Minnie Driver.I was entertained by the movie but felt its mix of low comedy (profanity is frequent, especially when Damon gets down with his gang of fellow low-lifes which includes best mate Chuckie, played by Affleck) with heightened psychological drama didn't always convince. Naturally, Damon gets off to a frosty start with last-resort Willams and even more naturally they open up to each other before the tears really flow in one of the movie's well signposted climaxes further down the line. Ditto the obvious conclusion too when Damon finally lets his heart rule his head.It's well acted although at times it seems pretty stagy, with lots of male-bonding and man- hugs on board. Damon is believable as the gifted misfit but overdoes the angst at times. I didn't quite get Affleck as the goofy sidekick and got the impression he was cast for the part because he wrote it. Williams is good as the broken-down professor but his winsomeness and adoration of his deceased wife grate a bit by the end, Spencer Tracy he's not and while Driver is okay in her part, I didn't really feel the attraction between her and Damon..In the end, while the film engaged me enough, it did seem to me somewhat overrated and didn't quite take me fully on Will's journey to rehabilitation and spiritual redemption.",5,7,11,10 November 2012
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Don't dream, it's over.
","I loved the original Golden Age Mitty movie starring Danny Kaye, but really apart from retaining the title and being about a guy who daydreams a lot, this Ben Stiller directed and starring vehicle has nothing to do with it. That said, Stiller for me has the right degree of little-boy-lost meets downtrodden-little-guy pathos to just about make it work as a very convoluted plot unfolds. This Walter is a long-serving back-room, basement-floor worker at 'Life' magazine charged with processing photographs for publication and in particular those of the magazine's legendary yet elusive star photographer Sean O'Connell. Even though the magazine is closing down its print version to go on-line making most of the staff redundant, its dropped-in nerdy transition boss, played by Adam Scott wants to end up on a high with a big splashy cover and when O'Connell sends in a special picture (it's not that great actually), the decision is made to hold the front page for this one shot. Only thing is, Walter and his long-time co-worker can't find the darn thing which sets our hero on an impulsive quest to track down O'Connell incidentally taking him to Greenland, Iceland and eventually the Himalayas where at last he catches up with the enigmatic snapper.Along the way, we also meet his dotty sister and widowed mother as they help the latter move home where much is made of her late husband's piano and also watch as his budding romance with single parent Kristen Wiig blossoms as he daydreams her into his life. Personally I could have done without the forced, clichéd humour over his family particularly as Shirley MacLaine plays her part more like his grandmother but Wiig is very watchable as the winsome object of his affection with a love for early David Bowie, references to whose 'Space Oddity' hit become something of a running gag in the film.Forgetting about the over-thin and too-fantastic plot, it's hard not to be impressed by the flashy dream-sequences, especially the very first one where Walter executes a flying leap Jason Bourne would be proud of to save his fellow workers from their building on fire. The problem is though that the dreams are too big. Nobody has C-Gen dreams like this and they seem too much like excuses to insert eye-catching SFX sequences. There were subtler, better directorial touches though, like when a flock of birds forms Wiig's face and a subliminal message from his work-mate appears on a hillside but other ideas like Walter's skateboard trip around Iceland and especially a weirdly unfunny reference to 'Benjamin Button' seem over-contrived. That said, the cinematography of the Greenlandic and Icelandic locations is very well done with lots of panoramic eye-catching shots.Like I said, I liked Stiller and Wiig in their parts while Walter's interaction with bearded weirdy Scott is also good for some laughs but the celebrity cameos of MacLaine and Sean Penn as O'Connell didn't add anything to the film, for me.On the whole I found the movie patchy and a bit too slight and kooky to really hang together, likewise the mix and match soundtrack of 60's, 80's and contemporary music in the background. It would have been nice if someone had thought to reference the original movie even once by way of tribute and what happened to the phonetic links into Walter's dreams which in the original made you at least know exactly when our hero was actually dreaming. As it is, I'll stick with Kaye's Mitty over this slightly hit and miss remake.",6,0,1,10 June 2017
The Incredibles," Comic heaven
","Well, I love super-hero comicdom, my favourite era being the DC range from the mid-60's to late 70's so this Pixar feature on the Incredible family was a treat for my sore eyes and plays so much better than any number of real-life action simulations to which Hollywood is so much in thrall at the moment.Of course it's all in the writing, with a script that not only works as a comic adventure, but of course with all those sly, but never condescending digs at adult fascination with comic characters with their ridiculous costumes and of course personal problems. When not engrossed in the clever plot or laughing out loud at some killer one-liners ('You got me monologuing' intones master-villain Syndrome as his long-windedness affords Mr Incredible some valuable escape-time), of course being a Pixar production, I was marvelling at the animation which depicts various super stunts with consummate ease.The characterisation of all the characters is superb, with nods to 'The Simpsons', 'Fantastic Four' and even 'Married With Children', plus the musical soundtrack, James Bond derivative, is also perfectly simpatico. The vocal characterisations are marvellous too. There are various well-signposted sub-texts at play too, for the more discerning viewer, better and more succinctly handled than in any Iron/Spider/Super/Batman film I've seen and there's some lovely detail too in the writing (witness Syndrome's demise down to that pesky cape of his!). Plus there's a wicked little mickey-take on fashion designers too in the (small) shape of costumer extraordinaire 'E'.No, I absolutely loved every minute of it and have to declare it my favourite Pixar movie to date.",9,0,1,25 July 2010
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne too late
","Were the producers right to re-boot the Bourne franchise without Matt Damon? Well, everything and everyone else is at the moment, it seems, often while the original is still a recent memory, so I guess I should have been expecting this. By very simply expostulating that Jason Bourne wasn't the only brainwashed super-agent out there trying to find himself, it's really very easy to present another on-the-run rogue operative, this time Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross, returning to hunt and haunt his masters.However, the almost exact re-running of the plots of the three Damon-led films into one (or so it seemed to me), deflated my expectations somewhat. Renner does well enough in the lead but lacks something of the single-mindedness of purpose which Damon's driven acting style imparts to the role. I also found the plot somewhat laboured and far too much tech-speak employed, especially by Cross's pursuers.Of course what you expect most from a Bourne film are exciting fight-scenes, daredevil chases and hair-raising car-stunts. These are present but not always correct, Cross's rescue of female scientist Marta (played by Rachel Weisz) in particular lacking edge and while the pair's escape from the Thai police, plus a government-hired assassin let loose just to kill Cross, does better, taking in the obligatory race across the rooftops and a motorbike duel between them (at rush-hour time of course), but again scenes like these only take you back to similar happenings in Bournes 1-3, where I think personally they were done just a little bit better. Edward Norton gets the part of the big bad Government bureaucrat tracking down Cross with unimaginable surveillance systems which would astound even George Orwell, a part he plays with a steely, haughty resolve.Cross and Marta's apparent escape at the end leaves plenty of scope for a sequel or two and there is the intriguing thought that Bourne and Cross's paths could match in their common purpose, but I fear it might need a development like that to keep the series going. I quite enjoyed this blockbuster but in many ways it did have a sense of déjà-vu about it, although given the central character's identity problems, maybe I shouldn't be complaining.",5,0,1,24 March 2015
The Man Who Would Be King," Exceedingly good Kipling adaptation
","Hugely enjoyable epic based on Kipling's cautionary adventure tale in the only film to co-star probably Britain's two biggest stars of the 60's and 70's. Adapted and stirringly directed by the then veteran maverick director John Huston, this rags to riches to rags saga seems to anachronistically belong to a different era of film-making some ten or twenty years earlier.Not that you'd confuse it with a David Lean marathon, there's plenty of action within the detail and even if the unsavoury whiff of colonialist superiority taints somewhat the initial perception of our two heroes as hapless adventurers, by the end we're won over by their honourable and regret-free acceptance of their fate even if it means the fatal demise of Connery's Danny Dravot character and the reduction to penury of Caine's Peachy Carnehan character. A cautionary tale it may be about pride coming before a fall and the risk men take in setting themselves up as gods, but the film is more about the friendship which endures between Connery and Caine, not forgetting their devoted 'batman' Billy Fish, enjoyably brought to life by Saeeed Jaffrey.In the days before CGI & SFX, Huston does a fine job with the cinematography, particularly on location, as well as marshaling his large cast around the convincing sets. I'm fine too with the utilisation of writer Kipling as a character, introduced no doubt to frame the story as well as pointing up veracity and reminding us of its origins, with Christopher Plummer a convincing look-a-like. Caine and Connery reflect their own real-life friendship with mutually deferential performances, neither hogging the lime-light and staying true to character throughout, although as ever Sean's 'English' accent never moves south of Edinburgh! I've read somewhere that some critics believe the movie could have worked even better if they'd switched roles but I don't see this at all, Connery's character has a naturally lofty demeanour, leading to his god-like aspirations, while Caine's is that of the down-to-earth conscience and confidant, both just as they should be. I also liked the minor irony in Caine's new wife at the time (they're still together, even now) spurning Connery's advances and thus, in fact precipitating the Englishmen's fall from grace.This then was a film I've long anticipated watching and was delighted that it didn't let me down. No sex, little violence, a fine old-fashioned story well told, just the way they used to make them...",8,1,2,6 January 2011
Ghostbusters," Good spirits
","For years my wife has quoted phrases from this movie at me, such as 'Don't give me those bug-eyes Janine!', to 'Are you a god?, No, then die!' and 'It just popped in there', so, with only this and my liking of the sprightly theme song by Ray Parker Jr to go on, I finally tuned in to watch it. The thing is too, that I usually bypass most popular culture from the 80's (the decade that taste forgot), for instance I've never watched 'Ghost', 'Dirty Dancing', 'Top Gun' or 'E.T.' and won't be rushing to in the near future, there are far too many earlier movies I've still to see. But hey, I really enjoyed this unusual mix of frat comedy and supernatural / science fiction thrills.I liked the three amigo scientists right away, the womanising Bill Murray, earnest Dan Ayckroyd and professorial Ivan Reitman. Sigourney Weaver adds the sexiness (eventually) and Rick Moranis outdoes the three busters in geekiness as Weaver's lovelorn neighbour. The natural landscape of New York is effectively blended in, the special effects are fine for their day and the script delivers excitement and humour in equal measure.Not every idea from the Saturday Night Live team hit the jackpot but this one certainly deserved to, helped by an offbeat idea with broad appeal, a good script and a nice story arc which not only delivers a big finish but also sees Murray get the girl.Call again!",7,2,3,14 June 2014
Gran Torino," Clint's in the cradle
","A film that gets better as it goes, which after you accept its unlikely premise and engage with the characters and their situations, takes you to an unexpected and yet satisfying, if still downbeat, conclusion. Eastwood shows us, again, that there are stories out there for older actors, even if the main beneficiary here is himself.The movie strikes me as remarkably old-fashioned - in true Warner Brothers style, one could easily imagine a Spencer Tracy or Jimmy Cagney playing the mentor part here that Eastwood takes, whilst appreciating the action's updating into 'boys 'n the hood' territory. So we get the recently bereaved, mean and ornery widower Eastwood, the last American in a neighbourhood pretty much made over into Chinatown with the influx of Far Eastern immigrants and the contrasting stories of his lack of communication with his own distant, certainly selfish and inconsiderate family of sons and their wives who want him out of their way ensconced in a retirement home whilst anticipating being beneficiaries after his death, with the nascent relationships he builds up with the young children of the new Chinese family who move in next door.To be fair, I didn't believe for a moment that crusty old Clint, the Stars and Stripes fluttering proudly over his porch, would ever hook up and bond with the new arrivals as he does, but you have to give the story licence to unfold. This also takes in a sub-plot of Eastwood's relationship with a keen young priest who follows a promise to the former's late wife to look after the old coot and hopefully bring him to a sort of redemption.This stuff takes up most of the first two thirds of the movie and is as unbelievable as it's occasionally over-sentimental. However when the teenage gang turn to rape and violence on his by-now young protégé Thao, his sister and the rest of their family, after Eastwood's well-meant but ill-judged intervention, the film takes a darker turn as Eastwood, who we see throughout coughing up blood, hinting at his own impending demise, resolves the problem in an unusual and surprising way, choosing passivity over violence to get the job done.The conclusion plays with our pre-conceived notions of Eastwood's tough-guy persona from his Leone and Dirty Harry pictures - indeed I thought the screenplay had written itself into a corner, but as I said above, resolves this satisfyingly, redolent of Cagney's classic 'Angels with Dirty faces' all those years earlier - that film had a priest in a prominent part too.The acting is fine by all, although Clint's rasp really can be hard to make out at times. His cinematography, as usual is very good, the contemporary neighbourhood and its environs, convincingly depicted, less so the characters, I have to say.His main strength, however, remains his story-telling nous - there's never any flashy directing tricks, just point the camera at the characters, give them stuff to say and a story to inhabit and print it. Works fine for me.",7,0,9,23 August 2009
Shrek the Third," Ogre and out...?
","It took me a while to catch up with the third edition of the money-spinning 'Shrek' franchise and I was vaguely aware of a less than positive critical, if not popular response, to it but was pleasantly surprised with the product on show. Okay, it's pick-your-cliché from 'the law of diminishing returns', 'familiarity breeding contempt' and 'too much of a good thing', but hey, I still like these characters and whilst I now would doubt whether the characters and situations can be developed any further at least on the big-screen, it's certainly been one of the better trilogies of recent years. The graphics and animations are as before so good as to make you think you're wearing 3D spex and the story, while contrived (I'm not quite sure how Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table actually qualify as classic children's fairy-tale or cartoon favourites) shares the laughs around before winding up at the by now familiar happy-ending finish with a romp-out to a classic track from yesteryear, this time Sly Stone's funk-tastic 'Thank you...'. Best moments are the Gingerbread Man's life flashing before him in a (threatened) pre-death moment and the four Disney princesses (plus one ugly step-sister!) giving it some attitude as they find liberation (even burning a bra symbolically, in the process). Best line, as usual, goes to Eddie Murphy's Donkey 'I'm being attacked by an ogre - with issues!'. There aren't as many outright belly-laughs as in the peerless first 'Shrek', you feel that Shrek and Fiona are more bit-players in their own movie (I can't believe I'm humanising animated characters!) and occasionally you're made to wait for the next really good joke (Eric Idle's Merlin and Justin Timberlake's Arthur don't exactly leap off the page/screen either), so yes, this outing of the not-so-jolly green giant, may not be as good as its predecessors but that's down to the lack of surprise at revisiting these stock characters and, heck, they were mighty good predecessors!",7,4,5,22 August 2008
The Hurt Locker," Same stuff, different war...
","Unremittingly tough and bleak modern-day war movie, heavily decorated at the Oscars. War isn't my favourite movie-subject and to really strike home with me, such a movie has to demonstrate either extra originality or emotional power to really resonate with me.Well-made and acted as it is 'The Hurt Locker' didn't accomplish either with me. I certainly commend director Bigelow and her writing and production team for taking an uncomfortable subject and addressing it so honestly, but the premises that the war does terrible things to people, physically and psychologically (in that order), throws together unfamiliar comrades in arms and of course involves almost inconceivable brutality and violence are hardly new.It is of course harrowing to see Iraqi citizens coerced into becoming living bombs or even dead bombs and it is natural t witness the de-sensitising of the sensibilities of the three-man American UXB team, confronting these situations day-in day-out, with no human way to release the complex emotions of fear, disgust and at times callousness they experience in going about what is after all their jobs. The three men here all react in different ways, in itself creating tensions within the group and not surprisingly leading them into deadly danger from time to time.It's all very difficult but of course important for viewers to watch. The acting is as is absolutely necessary grounded in hyper-reality with a proliferation of hand-held camera shots and pan-outs to the usually dumb crowd of what may or may not be innocent spectators only adding to the tension bordering on paranoia that the soldiers experience every day.I didn't care for the superstar cameos of the likes of Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes as their celebrity detracted from the veracity of the other characters in the film. There's little pretence at a linear narrative other than the countdown of the days of duty remaining on the roster of the team, and these probably not unisolated dramatic events which overtake them periodically and they have to react to in such a way as to stay alive, in one piece and retain their sanity.It was enthralling to watch, in particular the recreation of the devastating effects of an explosion, lifting people off the ground in super-slow motion but the whole just didn't get under my skin enough.There have been many better war films than this which didn't win Oscars.",6,0,3,28 March 2011
Back to the Future Part III," Future bright
","My big mistake watching this film was seeing it out of sequence. I'm sure I saw B.T.T.F.1 on its original release, but don't remember catching numbers 2 & 3 when they first came out. So maybe I should have held off viewing this, the final episode in Marty & the Doc's time-travelling adventures, but if I lopped off the framing elements at the beginning and of this the third feature, it was still easy to enjoy this typically bright, humorous and action- packed Robert Zemeckis film.This time, to prevent the Doc's death in a past-life, our intrepid heroes have to double- back in time (with thanks to ZZ Top) to the old West to fix the time-line and still find a way back to their own time, a tricky task given that the DeLorean gets damaged en-route. Along the way, Marty meets his forebears and the Doc falls in love, the climax of the western section being a high noon showdown between Marty and a demonised Biff, before the expected race against time for Marty and the tying up of loose ends epilogue.I liked the film a lot, like the runaway train at the end it picks up speed as it goes and even if Zemeckis does pile on the climaxes a bit, it entertains all the way. As before, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd pal about well together, while Mary Steenbergen is a welcome newcomer as Lloyd's surprise love-interest. The special effects don't always quite come off, but there are some neat humorous touches, like when Marty and the Doc exchange catch-phrases and especially Marty's preferred post-breakfast gunfighting preference. Marty's back-story about meeting his great-great grandparents is weakened by him having clumsily play both parts but otherwise this was a good-natured, matinée-adventure fun movie. Now to go back to the past and watch parts one and two.",7,0,0,25 October 2013
The Illusionist," All done with mirrors
","An entertainingly old-fashioned historical mystery thriller (I think that covers it!), spiced up with magic and political intrigue. At heart a love story between a commoner (Edward Norton's Eisenheim character) and a noblewoman (Jessica Biel's Lady Sophie), their youthful affair is sundered by her outraged family. Fate brings them together again as adults at which point she is unwittingly and somewhat unwillingly being used as a political pawn in the machinations of Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) to usurp his father's throne and he has developed a reputation as a master illusionist. Her rekindled love for Eisenheim jeopardises the Prince's plans as well as stirring his jealousy, rendering the men implacable enemies, with the Prince employing his chief of police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to discredit Eisenheim and ensure Sophie plays her part as his consort. How Eisenheim strikes back at the Prince with a daring new illusion forms the main suspense as the film reaches its conclusion.Released at around the same time as Christopher Nolan's similarly themed and for me more confusing and overrated 'The Prestige', I preferred the relative simplicity of the narrative here, with the characters' motivations being much easier to discern. Beautifully shot in golden suffused light to enhance the period detail, well acted by all concerned and with Philip Glass' compellinhly hypnotic score in the background, it looks like a well portrayed theatrical production, at times like watching a play within a play.While the ending isn't hard to work out and the Police Chief's 'Eureka!' moment somewhat contrived, still all the loose ends are conveniently explained and tied up by the end, making this a satisfying and easy on the eye entertainment.",7,0,1,4 August 2012
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Light fantastic
","Undemanding, sit-back, in-flight entertainment, which is in fact where I viewed this comic-book sequel. I am a comic book fan (more a DC than Marvel guy, I must say) and so can accept this type of fantasy film if the notion takes me. The Fantastic Four seem on the whole to be a much lighter subject than such complex individuals as the troubled Batman and Spider Mans of this imaginary world and so the film must be accepted at a much lower level. The characterisations are about as thin as comic-strip paper, the humour forced and of course it's product placement all the way but the story rattles along with special effects (of a decidedly mixed quality) in almost every other scene. The actors barely merit mention, playing their clothes (should that be costumes) adequately and I also thought the Stan Lee cameo as stilted as it was unnecessary. As I stated above, the SFX are good only in patches, the computer generated Silver Surfer fairly leaps out of the screen and comes off best overall but Mr Fantastic's stretching capabilities seem to, well, overstretch the director and his team. In summary, I think I'd have preferred to have read a half dozen or so FF mags in the time it took to watch this big-screen adaptation but I can't and won't complain overmuch.",5,0,1,21 December 2007
Sing Street," Boys and Girls on Film
","Really enjoyed watching this I suppose you might call it musical-comedy film set in 1985 Dublin. Mixing in recognisable parts of various earlier films and TV programmes such as, deep breath, 'The Commitments', 'Gregory's Girl', 'Back To The Future' 'About A Boy' and even 'Grange Hill', you can tell from all of these that we're firmly in teenage angst territory. To be fair, the setting in Dublin doesn't add too much to proceedings as there's no special references to the sectarian divide which was more prevalent then, so that the film could have been set in Anytown, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. However the Dublin placement is as apt as any in demonstrating the outreach of popular music as well as the romance of young folks yearning for a better life away from home and of course the unique Irish accent and humour.Of course a certain amount of stereotypical characterisation can't be avoided in a feel-good movie like this, with the supposedly unattainable dream girl, old-fashioned, domineering school headmaster and lunkheaded bully who all interact with the young lead as he arrives new in school wearing an immediately distinctive pair of brown loafers and who makes it even tougher for himself in a way by going all Robert Smith as he forms a New Romantics-inspired band with a bunch of talented schoolmates and dolls himself up in eye-shadow and multi-coloured hair.Most of the scenes like I said have resonances from the other films mentioned with many of the scenes seeming familiar from elsewhere but there's enough flair, charm and energy to make it pull through and come together. My favourite scenes were the recruitment of the only black boy on the estate, the songwriting sessions with his multi-talented schoolmate and the 'Back To The Future' dream sequence but episodic as it is, it's all directed and acted very engagingly so that you accept and acknowledge the sometime clichés as you laugh along with the humour and get behind the teen hero as he chases his dreams of sorting out his dysfunctional family, getting the girl and chasing his musical dream. The ending's good as we're not shown if any of them work out but at least the lad's trying to make a change in his life.The original songs are all very good, if not always strictly in-period, there's little profanity in the dialogue and the acting and singing of the young cast are very good, making it a fun, enjoyable dare I say it, family entertainment movie.",8,1,2,17 July 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Dragon fire
","Haven't read the book or seen the Hollywood remake, but having recently enjoyed the likes of 'Borgen' on TV I wanted to experience the Swedish original adaptation of the Stiegg Larssen best-seller (subtitled version). I wasn't disappointed. An ingeniously plotted whodunnit thriller, it cleverly sets out its stall, clues, suspects and all and weaves them all together before tying up every loose end by the final scene. It also gives us the unforgettable character of Lisbeth, the punk-ish computer hacker whose distrust and resentment against patrician older men is explained much later in the piece, at the same time completing her identification with the missing girl at the heart of the story. Probably the most unforgettable scenes are those where she is firstly forcibly raped by her appointed guardian and even more so in the graphic scene where she takes her revenge. I was however unconvinced by her trysts with the investigative middle-aged journalist with whom she forms an unlikely alliance to crack the case, not least as we had previously seen her in bed with another female much earlier.I enjoyed the Morse-like attention to detail in the 40 year-old mystery, based on the intense scrutiny of snap-shot photography at a town parade and the 'Se7en'-like use of themed murders, where the key to the killer's motives are referenced in Biblical quotations. I can forgive this plagiarism when it's as skilfully managed as it is here. Yes, it is asking a lot to swallow that a witness on the same day so long ago would retain an insignificant picture which unwittingly contains the killer's image, but I'll give it the dramatic licence it needs, as it was still an intriguing plot device.There's a terrific, heart-stopping climax at the killer's lair when Lisbeth comes to reporter Nvqvisst's nick-of-time's rescue immediately followed by an arresting scene where she presumably at last expunges her own demons by refusing to spare the by now helpless killer. The acting throughout is superb by the whole cast and the photography marvellously evocative of the appropriately cold desolate Swedish landscape, the setting for the horrendous crimes. The background music too was apposite and unobtrusive. I look forward to the two successors with relish even if it seems unlikely, given Lisbeth's transformation and migration to sunnier climes in the final moments.",8,1,2,15 July 2012
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Implausible holocaust tragic fable.
","Not many people seem to be giving this 'holocaust drama' low marks but I'll be amongst them. I found its implausible, no make that impossible plot line acted wholly against the credibility that such a serious subject deserves and found myself by the end of the film with that awkward feeling of having been manipulated which should never be part of a truly satisfying cinematic experience.Yes, it's well shot and the attention to period detail is satisfactory, but that should surely be taken as granted in modern-day films, particularly after Spielberg put down the marker with 'Schindler's List'. Some of the actors look right, particularly the 'only following orders' German P.O.W. Commandant husband and his ignorant, unwilling wife, but others don't. Maybe I'm just too familiar with David Hayman in his brilliant white shirts in TV's 'Trial and Retribution' but here he appears miscast and overdoes the nervous mannerisms and tics of his character. Sheila Hancock gets a brief useless cameo as the grandparent with a little bit of a conscience but again why an English actress in the part? Most glaringly and not for the first time in a war movie with child actors, the audience is expected to accept the kids talking in the plummiest English accents, whilst everyone else in the movie is in the correct German dialect - I can't believe there aren't competent German child actors who don't have a mastery of English - this anachronism, coupled throughout with oddly jarring use of familiar English language phrasing and syntax, further weakens the necessary veracity. And while I'm in a kicking mood, I'll put the boot in too to an over intrusive musical soundtrack. Far too many scenes are overdecorated by the composer's background piano-based trillings - again, for me, for films on this theme, less is more and silence invariably speaks louder than almost any kind of musical accompaniment.Worst of all is the sheer ridiculousness of the plot. Like the much-praised and in my opinion, equally over-rated 'Life is Beautiful', the central premise of the eight year old German and captive Jewish boys meeting and striking up a relationship is too fantastic for words plus they're too often given adult lines to speak. You can see from a long way out that a big tragic finish is in the making and sure enough, we're not disappointed. To be fair, the scenes where the Jewish prisoners, (plus one) are herded like cattle into the gas chambers are sensitively handled but again am I the only person who was mildly offended by the climactic scene where Bruno's parents are shown frantically failing to find and then bewailing afterwards the loss of their beloved son, while hundreds of Jews, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, equally beloved of their own families share the same fate?Sentimentality and incredible plotting always weaken war movies, no matter how well-meaning their intent and serious the message. This particular movie is guilty on all fronts as far as I'm concerned and failed to move me accordingly.",4,4,10,15 February 2009
Brave," Scotch missed
","'Brave' as in 'Scotland The...'? Just wondering how Pixar justified this latest 'snappy' one-word title which otherwise tells us little or nothing about the film. While I'm carping about names, as a Scot, I also don't recognise the name 'Merida' as being authentic, seems to me there are plenty of nice Scottish girl names that could have been used for the new Disney princess at the heart of the feature.Anyway onto the film which for me was a disappointment compared to other Pixar releases. Of course the animation is sumptuous, the detail in some of it is truly wondrous to behold particularly in the depictions of the rugged beauty of the Scottish Highland glens, especially when it's raining or catching the greyness of the cliffs, but the story here lacks magic, at least in the movie-magic sense.I just wasn't taken with the whole bear-transfiguration thing at all and that the film lacked a traditional Disney baddie for the heroine to play up against. And while on the subject of tradition wouldn't it have been more Disney-like if the transformed bad-bear Mordu had changed back to human form at the end to become Merida's Prince Charming? While one or two songs appear intermittently, they, for all their use of pipes and drums, are nonetheless insipid and are easily forgotten.As for the voices, while I commend the use of actual Scottish voices in the main for pretty much all the characters, the use of the over-familiar Billy Connolly as the blustery King seemed wrong to me. There are some humorous touches but the big laughs this time are elusive and the perennial cute-factor characters of Merida's three younger brothers barely registers either.I really had high hopes for 'Brave' but in the end was somewhat underwhelmed by the film. It just seemed to lack the verve, humour and charm of many of its Pixar predecessors.A 'Brave' failure in point of fact.",5,1,3,29 November 2014
Jerry Maguire," Louder than bombs...
","Not really my type of film, but I gave it a go. It's brash, in your face, very loud, a typical modern Hollywood mix of profanity and morality. I had no connection at all with any of the main characters or their situations, I mean I could care less about the contractual expectations of US sports stars and as for the somewhat forced romance of Tom Cruise's maverick sports agent and his acolyte Renee Zelwegger and her, shall I say, 'professorial' five year old kid, (I'm being kind, I almost thought a grown-up actor was playing the role, so un-child-like was the boy's performance, never mind the dialogue he's given to speak).And no, I didn't like Cuba Gooding's over-the-top performance as Cruise's only remaining client after he alienates his former employer and co-workers with a mass-circulated touchy-feely 'mission statement' to cleanse his conscience and soul. Talking loud and saying nothing, as James Brown once said. There were a few good lines and situations but these were hopelessly outnumbered by many more which were poorly conceived and executed and while I understand ex-Rolling Stone magazine writer Cameron Crowe filling up the soundtrack with 60's and 70's tracks by the Who, Stones and McCartney, none of the songs has any relevance to anything in the film.As for the acting, it was universally flashy and shouty, with no exceptions and you can see each of the leads acting if you watch closely enough. For a far more incisive and entertaining exposé of the soft white underbelly of sports and at a deeper level, morality at large, I'd suggest viewers look at Billy Wilder's 'The Fortune Cookie' instead.",3,5,11,20 November 2011
Clash of the Titans," Raise the Titans
","Pulverisingly loud and in-your-face blockbuster retelling the legend of Perseus, Hollywood style. As is Hollywood's wont, a lesser-known actor gets the main part, surrounded by bigger-name character actors in support to give the project some heft, but everything here is in thrall to the booming soundtrack and especially the special effects.These are plentiful and eye-popping at times, each sequence obviously setting out to top the preceding one, with the battle against a slithering, mesmerising Medusa only topped with the attack of the Krakken at the climax.Characterisation, again as is the norm, is slim, with the dialogue wooden and pretentious by turns. A little post-modern ironic humour wouldn't have gone amiss methinks instead of the odd mixture of contemporary modern and studiously archaic language on show here.As for the acting, no-one rises above the SFX, with Liam Neeson an unlikely Zeus and Ralph Fiennes almost indecipherable as Hades, while Worthington appears too squat for the heroic role of Perseus, although there's no doubting his athleticism.All that said, while the purists would probably hate it and liken it to a Disney park thrill-ride, as one who has ambitions to return to Florida next year, this whetted my appetite considerably.",6,0,0,1 July 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Behind every door...
","Sic-fi isn't quite my thing and much of this movie had me thinking of the several related cinematic reference points along the way (for starters, 'A Matter of Life And Death', 'Terminator 2', even TV shows like 'Heroes' and 'Sapphire And Steel', all of which adapt the notion of circular time to re-write the future. The difference here is that, in this film, our destinies are apparently controlled by peripheral men just out of our vision, wearing hats.Trust Matt Damon's rising young senator to buck the tend by falling coincidentally for modern dancer Emily Blunt, thus rewriting the future time-line of his would-be presidential character as well as Blunt's ascent to the top of her chosen profession as a top choreographer. Their love affair isn't part of the plan you see and the film posits the age-old question 'can true love conquer all?', although to be fair, the ending is never really in doubt.There was some stuff I liked in the film, the two leads, Damon and Blunt seem to bind together effectively, the story skips along pacify and some of the shots of modern day New York are impressive.Against this I wasn't quite sure with which story the director was happiest, the romantic drama of Damon and Blunt's burgeoning romance, the race around town at the end as Damon seeks to avoid having his mind erased of all his memories or just the trip around NewYork's major tourist attractions, entered through every different door the fleeing couple run through.Perhaps the film could could have implied the danger-factor more to give a bit more reason for all the running around - Damon must cover as much ground here as Tom Cruise did in the Firm.All in all though, the movie was an entertaining diversion, reasonably imaginative if lacking a little in tension to make it more compelling.",6,0,1,2 July 2011
Prisoners," By any means necessary...
","So how far would you go to get back your child who had just been kidnapped? That's the thrust of this dark movie which takes as its themes the disturbing and sadly, ever-topical subject of the abduction of young children and also the use of torture on the suspected perpetrator, even as I appreciate that the latter has only so far come into the public consciousness in the military world. Perhaps not being a parent and also something of a libertarian, I didn't find myself on the side of the, I hesitate to say, (avenging) angels and found the scenes of what I'll understatingly term rendition, as upsetting as they were unjustifiable in a so-called civilised society. Besides this I found the movie's condescension to the conventions demanded of Hollywood thrillers compromised the bigger subjects it attempted to address.The fulcrum of the film is the disappearance and as we soon learn, kidnapping of two young girls, one white, one black, from their two families on Thanksgiving Night in an anonymous blue-collar US town. After the prime suspect, a young, mentally retarded man, is released for lack of corroborative evidence, the two fathers, Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard, decide to take matters into their own hands, the former leading the latter on and himself turning into a semi-crazed vigilante, abducting the suspect and creating a grisly torture chamber to extract the truth from him. Also becoming consumed with the case is the local one-man, or so it seems, police service, Jake Gyllenhaal, egged on by the impotence of the law he serves and a sympathy with the parents for their loss, he too struggles to preserve his sanity and necessary detachment from the case, but who of course still arrives at the Eureka-type resolution and ends up delivering, what I'll term a predictable Hollywood ending.Personally speaking, I couldn't marry up the wider philosophical and ideological questions the film throws up with the conventions of the dynamics of a big-money feature. I found it pandered too much to our baser emotions when in truth it should have been more questioning of Jackman's methods and I think sends out the wrong message about taking the law into one's own hands, no matter the provocation. On a more mundane level, I was unconvinced by the denouement, even to the extent of the surprise identity of the actual perpetrator and also the insertion of curious red-herrings along the way and an unbelievable life-or-death race-against-time.As for the acting, you'd certainly call it committed and driven, but for me anyway, both Jackman and Gyllenhaal failed to really engage me in their pivotal roles while the drawn- out direction, filmed to a backdrop of grainy, often rainy exteriors, never struck the required balance between docu-drama and nail-biting tension. This movie was a tough, gruelling watch (one suspects there is a much-longer director's cut in the background) and while a welcome reduction of the ridiculously over-the-top takes we've seen recently from Hollywood on this upsetting subject (Liam Neeson's 'Taken' films for example), still didn't get the balance right, in my eyes.",5,3,7,29 September 2013
The Dark Knight," (K)night and the city...
","Having just watched for the first time 'Batman Begins' (guess who got the double DVD set for Christmas!), I was keenly anticipating my viewing of the almost universally praised sequel, the record-breaking 'The Dark Knight'.I was not disappointed. Unlike its predecessor, there's no 'origin' sequence to slow down the 'clobberin' time' (to mix up my comic-book metaphors!) and while I would recommend any comic-lovers to read the superb 'Killing Joke' graphic novel which does just that, we're here presented with The Joker full-on from the outset, of course tying in with the continuity from the end of the first film.Much has been said about the performance of the late Heath Ledger in the Clown of Crime role and I was naturally curious to see if it lived up to the hype. Again, I have to say, believe it. This is a truly superb performance, endowing what is after all a comic-book creation with psychological and psychopathic depths. While not conforming physically to the idealised image of The Joker as painted up beanpole in a purple dress-coat, Ledger's commitment to the role knocks aside any reservations on that score. You almost believe that the scars which grotesquely extend his manic grin are real (a brilliant attribute which I never picked up from the comics), so deep does he reach into the role.Almost as good is Aaron Eckhart as nemesis number two on show, namely Harvey Dent D.A. who metamorphoses into the twisted 'Two-Face'. His ghastly fate is set-up with a number of premonitory phrases if you listen closely enough to the soundtrack and as well as sporting the best make-up effect in the whole film, Eckhart too makes the pulp villain into something believable.This is where the film is most successful, with its concentration on characterisation heightened sufficiently above the norm against a similarly exaggerated, but still grounded in reality, cityscape which any urban dweller can imagine all too easily. The duality of pretty much all the characters is brought to the forefront, particularly the central premise that the Batman and Joker justify each other's existence which is why the half-way house character of Two-Face alongside them (in the previous Batman series he was paired off with 'The Riddler'), is so right with all the maxims about two sides of the one coin etc absolutely manifest, particularly the celebrated scene where Batman indulges in straightforward interrogation brutality as he's brought to the edge of his reason that The Joker voluntarily and Dent, involuntarily actually cross.Which brings me to The Batman, almost third-string in his own movie. Perhaps it's just that old song about the devil having all the best tunes but certainly while a complex character in his own right, Batman here pales in significance beside The Joker and Two-Face and seems in fact to get roughly the same screen-time to almost tacitly acknowledge this fact.Onto other facets of the film and praise must also go the cinematographers, stunt organisers, special effects technicians and Messrs Zimmer and Newton Howard's atmospheric soundtrack. The only debits for me were the casting of Maggie Gylenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes. I actually quite liked Katie Holmes in 'Batman Begins' and found the less glamorous Gylenhaal too jarringly different in the part. Continuity counts for a lot in a series like this, less so oddly enough for the costumed characters than the flesh and blood everyday parts and I found her performance wanting.Also the plot-dense narrative lost me from time to time and I really just didn't get what The Joker was planning with the ferries' stand-off at the conclusion. With a bit of imagination, I'm sure the writers could have given us a big, certainly more memorable three-way confrontation between the main protagonists, say, at Arkham.So whither now for the franchise? The producers mustn't weaken the vision here by allowing key-players like Nolan or Bale to move on and the introduction of new characters from the comics (Robin? The Riddler? - arguably the two campest characters in Batman's cast) must be done sympathetically to what has gone before. This series is too good to stop now and shouldn't be allowed to deteriorate as the 80's first reinvention by Tim Burton was sadly allowed to. I caught the reference to cats which makes me think that Catwoman might take a bow next time. Whoever gets her part however will certainly be up against it as comparisons to Ledger's performance, at one stroke trashing the memory of Jack Nicholson, will require not only a similarly dramatic revision of the part but also a performance of similar dare and imagination.Until then, I'll be there for the next one, same Bat time, same Bat - channel...",8,1,4,11 January 2009
Everest," Trouble at the top
","Watching this film was almost as gruelling as the work the actors put in themselves in this latest movie to recreate a true-life tragedy and yet I found its two hour duration passed by very quickly, so involving is it for the viewer.I myself wasn't aware of the real story behind the film although with the recent avalanche tragedy on the mountain still fresh in the memory, it had a topicality about it even if it wasn't an avalanche that caused the tragedy here. Instead the causes appeared to be a lack of cooperation amongst competing teams aiming for the summit, poor timing at key stages of the climb, poor communications with the back-up team but of course the main reason was just sheer bad luck as a freak storm blew up and critically held up the descent and left the mountaineers exposed to the elements at their must severe.There's no question that the almost documentary-style realistic approach was effective, with the weather effects and make-up work in particular putting the viewer right into the action. There were also some marvellous panning shots from on high lending an appropriate scale fitting to the monumentality of the physical task required to conquer the highest peak in the world. Of course the irony is that rather like Scott at the South Pole, the climbers here achieved their aim but couldn't complete the actual task which is to afterwards get back safely to base.This isn't really an actors' film in my opinion given the set up of the film plus with their heavy out-wear clothing, profusion of beard-wearers and with their faces often covered up with snow and ice, it was heard for any of the lead actors to be really prominent but I actually felt this benefited the realism of the story anyway.In the end the viewer must decide whether the attempt on the summit was brave or foolhardy. The sad answer of course is that it was both but while I'm a bit of a white- knuckle fiend myself, this film convinced me very effectively that climbing Everest will certainly never make it onto my own bucket list",7,0,1,3 October 2015
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Straight down the middle
","Although a keen golfer myself with a love of the history of the game, perhaps due to not being an American, I somehow didn't know about this wonderful true story of young golfer Walter Ouimet winning the US Open golf championship in a play-off against two British golfing-greats Ted Ray and Harry Vardon, being caddied all the way round by a ten year old boy! I doubt even Disney could have come up with a story so implausible although it's perhaps no surprise that it was Disney who funded this warm, if sentimental and idealised bringing to life of the tale.Yes, there are some unnecessary touching-ups to the original sequence of events, like the liberty taken with the last-hole winning putt (Ouimet actually won by five strokes) and especially the invention of a society love interest of young Ouimet, not only to add a touch of romance but also, in the form of her snobbish father and brother, some class-conflict, just one more obstacle for the young golfer to take on. The film wisely chooses not to demonise his two main English opponents Ray and especially all-time great Vardon, indeed the latter is shown to have demons of his own and who apart from one mild example of gamesmanship practiced against an opponent, is shown to be demonstrably fair and sporting, very much upholding the traditions of the game.It does take a bag-full of camera tricks to make golf exciting in a movie and director Bill Paxton uses every one of them to try to do so, using zoom-ins and outs, fast-cutting and slow-motion, at times even sitting the viewer actually on the ball as it flies to its target. These are perhaps overdone and betray the film's target family audience, but are compensated by good acting by all the main actors, especially young Le Bouef a credit to the memory of the modest but competitive Ouimet and the even younger Josh Flitter as Eddie Lowery, his moxy, pint- sized caddie, who was obviously 10 going on 40 (unsurprisingly the real-life Lowery grew up to become a millionaire).Filmed in warm soft-focus with a pleasant depiction of the era of golf's Golden Age and a stirring soundtrack at its back,this was an entertaining film, which while occasionally taking the circuitous route, managed to get round the course in a little bit better than par, I'd say.",6,0,0,5 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Hurry up Harry! (with thanks to Sham 69!)
","I quite like the Harry Potter books and try to read the novel of the film before-hand and so approached 'Order Of The Phoenix', wondering like many, just how the director could cut a 700 page novel into a just over two hours movie. The conclusion I draw is, very unconvincingly, so much so that it's no surprise to me to learn that the production team behind this money-spinning franchise plan to split the last humungously large novel into two parts. That's not to say that JK Rowling's writing couldn't do with some pruning for the big screen, but certainly on the evidence of this poorly edited instalment, I'm more in favour of the double-up plan. There's's also the dread element of inherent formula-ism, dictated of course by the source novels, following as usual the path of Harry encountering his magical friends and / or enemies in the neighbourhood of Little Whinging, displacement to Hogworts, his in-out tribulations with friends Hermione and Ron, interaction with teachers good and bad, winding up with a big, dramatic climax where nothing is resolved one way or the other - Voldemort always lives to fight another day. It must have been almost impossible for the director to do any more with these base elements than is conjured up here, but even with the introduction of the mildest of love interest (from out of nowhere, or so the film would have it) between Harry and Cho, a reasonably malevolent turn by Imelda Staunton as on-the-make Black Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge and the death at the finale of Harry's beloved godparent, Sirius, the film fails to engage leaving the viewer breathless at the end, certainly admiring of the SFX on show but ultimately dissatisfied that Harry and his cohorts get to the end of the film in no more danger than the last. Victims of the breakneck editing of the piece, to the best of my recollection, are, besides the wholesale extraction of the Quidditch tournament which sees Ron humiliated then redeemed as goal-minder, a series of key scenes that are almost butchered in the rush to get to the end. These include, as hinted earlier, the lack of any meaningful build-up to Harry's kiss with Cho, the revealing of her later complicity in ratting to Umbridge of Harry's behind-her-back dark arts lessons to his school chums, Voldemort's attack on the Weasleys' father, the session with Snape which reveals Harry's parents in their bullying of the young Snape not to be the golden-couple everyone imagined them to be. Most gaping of all is the sly Staunton's fate - the last you see of her she's being whisked away by a bunch of angry centaurs, then at the resolution, you're blandly told in a newspaper montage that she's lost her position as Headteacher. Guess she got away from the centaurs unscathed then..! All this and more flies by in a blur, with very little humour to lighten the load, almost zero characterisation and at the end one feels the way you would as if you've gone through a flight-simulator type ride at a theme park rather than the real deal of an actual roller-coaster. Goodness knows how people who haven't read the novel made sense of it! Maybe the little kids will understand, as Jim Morrison once said, but the more discerning of them and the rest of us, might feel shortchanged by Harry's Gang, this time around.",5,1,2,6 May 2008
Singin' in the Rain," Swingin' in the rain
","I can't gainsay this classic musical its status as one of Hollywood's very best, although I do have one or two issues with it which stop me giving it an even higher mark. On the plentiful plus side are the wonderful dance numbers, particularly the iconic title piece, but also Donald O'Connor's brilliant solo 'Make 'em Laugh', the golly-gosh niceness of 'Good Morning' and of course the celebrated 'Broadway Melody' finale, the often overlooked very witty and funny screenplay which brilliantly satirises the traumatic transition time in Hollywood from 'Silents' to 'Talkies' and some fine acting performances, if not by the leads.I admit to something of a problem with Kelly, he's no great singer and his lantern-jawed acting often distinctly smells of ham, but a great choreographer and dancer he undoubtedly was and he's never better than here. I did find Debbie Reynolds too young and winsome for her part as Kelly's love interest and it's a pity her character's initial feistiness is watered down as the film progresses, but her personality still shines through more than enough. Donald O'Connor I do like in his supporting part as Kelly's side-kick, even if he does seem at times to be a mini-me Danny Kaye, but it's Jean Hagen who steals the acting plaudits with her sub Judy Halliday routine as the screechy, back- stabbing Lina Lamont - you'll be saying 'I caint stain 'im' for hours afterwards.The film is bright, colourful, musical but most of all very funny and can deservedly be celebrated as one of the best musicals ever made.",9,0,1,11 September 2011
Puss in Boots," Cat in the hat
","This quite amusing spin-off prequel from the 'Shrek' franchise follows the adventures of lovable rogue Puss In Boots as he establishes his legend in an adventure which takes in the nursery rhymes of principally 'Jack and Jill' and 'Humpty Dumpty', and 'Jack and The Beanstalk' with a little splash of 'Little Boy Blue' thrown in for good measure.It starts well as we get re-acquainted with the daredevil adventurer Puss, with some nice gags and terrific animation but rather runs out of steam as the story gets elongated by extended chase sequences by which time I came to the conclusion that this was a short padded out to feature-length. Perhaps Puss can't really carry a film on his own and familiarity breeds a little contempt as many of the cat-related gags employed seem recognisable from the earlier Shrek films, including those involving fur-balls, cat's eyes and how a cat always falls on its feet.I quite liked the Kitty Softpaws character as well as the villainous Jack and Jill protagonists but felt that the tie-up with Humpty Dumpty somewhat contrived. The best scene was probably the early dance-off between Puss and Kitty but the conclusion with the returning giant Mother Goose again was too reminiscent of the flying dragon climax to 'Shrek'.'Puss In Boots' as I indicated doesn't quite step up to major character here and while containing many fun and amusing moments never achieves the heights the mighty Shrek achieved. Never really had a cat's chance, did it?",5,0,2,25 December 2014
Taken," Junior Bourne
","The Bourne series appears to have rejuvenated the whole action-movie genre (even infecting the Bond franchise), in my opinion mostly for the better, with white-knuckle-ride thrills, conviction acting and contemporary settings now the norm where once there was Willis / Schwarzenegger cartoon excess. I know which I prefer as I say. This kidnap thriller certainly borrows heavily from the Bourne template, (not to mention Charles Bronson's 'Death Wish', from an earlier era and even recent French thriller 'Tell No One') with Liam Neeson metamorphosing from a seemingly ordinary average doting father into a driven, clinical but of course resourceful killing machine to rescue his teenage daughter from Algerian abductors in Paris. The film did though for me take a little too long to get going and suffers somewhat from too much sentimentality (of all things) particularly in the mawkish scenes between Neeson, his estranged wife, now a rich-man's plaything and their spoilt 17 year-old daughter. Disbelief suitably suspended though, Neeson incredibly tracks her down pretty much from scratch to a girl-trafficking syndicate where drugged-up teenagers are bid for in an eerily abhorrent 'auction' by respectable-seeming businessmen, his character unsurprisingly racking up car-wrecks and body-count a-plenty. 'The Searchers' it isn't and Neeson basically has to carry the film as he's by far the biggest name on board here but he certainly convinces as the expert retired intelligence operative, who snaps back into the groove under extreme provocation. The rest of the acting's nothing to write home about however and I feel the film could have benefited with better support and also by building up the Mr Big character a bit more as Neeson's nemesis. I also felt some of the action sequences were tricky to follow and fully engage with as the backgrounds were often unnecessarily dark and afflicted by a sort of staccato, stop-start camera style. The best action sequences in 'The Bourne Ultimatum', by contrast flow naturally in a sort of heightened real-time and often in broad daylight. For all its plagiarism however and other defects I've mentioned above, this was still a watchable almost-all-action movie for a Saturday night.",6,2,7,10 November 2008
This Is Spinal Tap," Excess all areas
","The IMDb Key Plot-words says it all really...how many movies can you think of which list 'cucumber' as one of its key words? In case you haven't seen it by the way, afore-mentioned cucumber is the culmination of only one of several hilarious sight gags in this priceless send-up of the early 80's rock industry. It's almost as much fun trying to work out just which naff bands from that era Spinal Tap are based on...me, I can obviously see references to Black Sabbath (complete with Sharon Osbourne-type interfering wife-cum-manager!) and veteran UK boogie-merchants Status Quo with their psychedelic beginnings and twin-guitarist, intellectually-challenged duo of Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt, heck they seem to almost prophesy Van Halen and they got to the Black Album years before Metallica! Everybody plays it dead straight which garners maximum comic effect and the set-piece gags are brilliantly set up and deliver big laughs every time. Favourite scenes...? Too many to count but how about the band getting lost on the way to the stage of a dingy Stateside university, harmonising at Graceland, the finger-sandwich scene, the miniature Stonehenge backdrop, replete with to-scale dancing druid-dwarfs, not forgetting the pod-busting sequence. The ridiculously over-the-top sexist lyrics to the Iron Maiden riffed songs will also crack you up. I've actually no time at all for the heavy-metal genre of music, especially its early 80's spandex era so scathingly targeted here (Whitesnake anyone?) and sometimes wonder if true HM fans are in on the joke even as they laugh along with the rest of us... Either way, a spoof movie of the rock scene which sets the gold standard for all succeeding 'rockumentaries' (serious and comic!) just as 'Airplane' and 'The Naked Gun', to name but two did for disaster movies and cop-shows respectively.",8,7,11,5 September 2008
Alice in Wonderland," Alice in chains
","Maybe I'm getting all CGI'd out but all these phantasmagorical movies of recent years seem to me to be blending into one big amorphous morass. Watching this Tim Burton update of the classic 'Alice In Wonderland' tale (why keep the same title for a different story?), I felt there was little I hadn't seen before in a Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings or Narnia derivation, never mind the ghosts of Burton's own past including 'Beetlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory' and 'Sleepy Hollow'. So we get a late teenage Alice with issues, a much darker and good-and-evil polarised Wonderland (or Underland, if you will), and a much bigger part, not unnaturally, for big star Depp. Unfortunately this latter condescension to the box-office skewers the film too much away from Alice as the title and therefore central character. Burton also can't resist a bloody big battle as the conclusion as Alice confronts the dread Jabberwocky. Plus a typically bombastic soundtrack from Danny Elfman which hardly helps with the enchantment. Yes, it is a grand spectacle and must have looked great in 3D for those with extra cash to spend but Burton makes the mistake of treating the audience like adults when we should be made to look more for our inner-child again. As for the performances, Mia makes for a fairly unconvincing Alice and seems too old for part. Depp plays his wide-eyed eccentric outsider the way he always does, only this time, for some reason he trots out his dreadful Scottish accent (a la Mike Myers) he last utilised in 'Finding Neverland'. Better is Mrs Burton herself, Helena Bonham-Carter as the wicked red queen (for some reason she's not called the Queen Of Hearts despite being surrounded by hundreds of them at her court) and her enormous head while there's lots of British support in real-life roles as well as in speaking roles for the talking animated characters. I also think the film could have inserted a bit more humour, especially in the second half, to leaven the heaviness. Certainly it's easy on the eyes, with some good stunts and yes, special effects dropped in at regular intervals, but in the end it employed too many genre clichés for my liking and thus let down",5,0,3,30 September 2011
The Artist," Louder than words.
","A one-off sheer delight for anyone with a love and appreciation of cinematic history and good old-fashioned clean entertainment. Set-up as a tribute to the days of the silent movies, it does so cleverly, lovingly and imaginatively.Beautifully shot in monochrome with many scenes worthy of pause, it's superbly edited using old-style dissolves for the transitions. The plot happily evokes so any vintage Hollywood classics, most obviously 'Singin' In The Rain' and 'A Star Is Born' but there are references to 'Sunset Boulevard', 'The Lost Weekend', 'Lassie', 'Swing Time', 'Citizen Kane' and probably many others too. The score also is sympathetic to the action, drawing in themes from classic soundtrack, most notably Hitchcock's composer Bernard Herrmann but there's much more to the film than just playing 'spot the origin'.Some of the scenes are just so cleverly staged and written, like Valentin and Peppy's meeting on the stairs with a cast of extras in constant motion around them, the irony of a silent-film star who can't speak to his wife, Valentin's nightmare in sound, I could go on and on.I really liked the two French lead actors, previously unknown to me. Juan Dujardin as the male lead, George Valentin, an action-hero matinée idol with the athleticism of Douglas Fairbanks Sr, the stubbornness against the talkies of auteurs Chaplin and Keating with a smile as wide as Gene Kelly. With his ever-faithful mutt at his side, his fall from grace is precipitated by his failing marriage then exacerbated by his ostrich-like dismissal of the arrival of the talkies before he is ruined by the stock-market crash the same year. Too proud to accept help from anyone, especially the young female protégé whose career he launches, he falls down a long way before finding redemption at the very end.Berenice Bejo as Peppy is a delight as the new 'It-Girl', who makes the most of her lucky break but never forgets the man who gave her it. I personally could have done without the presence in the background of familiar faces John Goodman as the cigar-chomping producer and James Cromwell as Valentin's faithful butler which isn't however to denigrate their performances in any way.Thoroughly deserving of all its awards, sure it helps if you're a Golden Age Hollywood fan but as a refreshing balm to latter-day Hollywood's predilection for loud super-hero, car- chasing so-called blockbusters, 'The Artist' really is a veritable oasis in the desert.",8,1,4,9 August 2014
Invictus," Union of the State
","Appropriately, this dramatisation of South Africa's famous Rugby World Cup victory in 1995 in their own country, just a few years after Nelson Mandela's release from prison and the nation's re-admission to international sport, was shown while the present competition is occurring (Come on Scotland!). Actually I'm no rugby buff and so without a full working knowledge of the events of the time, bar the conclusion of course, let myself be swept along in a green and gold wave of sporting triumph and nation-building under the aegis of Mandela's benevolent presidency.The three narrative viewpoints centre on Mandela himself naturally and his transformation of the hard-line body politic in South Africa, the national rugby team captain Francois Pienaar and his evolution from relatively ignorant white Afrikaner to an inspiring one-nation sports idol, inspired by the humanity of Mandela and as a counterpoint microcosm of the new South Africa, the fractious, grudging melding of the established white security detail with Mandela's new black team which naturally goes from mutual dislike and mistrust to eventual respect and cooperation if not outright affection. In truth there wasn't too much drama to get excited about, as there usually isn't in sporting dramas and I have to say that while I enjoyed the triumph of the underdog and the respected the magnanimity of Mandela's conciliatory vision for his nation, director Eastwood didn't exactly rouse me out of my seat in so doing. I also never quite believed that I was watching Nelson Mandela, as Morgan Freeman, game as he is, just always looked like Morgan Freeman in the film. Damon benefits from being based on a less widely-known character although I understand that physically he resembles Pienaar just about as little as Freeman does Mandela. As ever he engages totally with his role, especially physically so that you believe in his part.The crowd scenes, especially recreating the stadium-full atmosphere of the Final and the later euphoric street celebrations of black and white alike are well done, even if you don't quite get the full blood and guts effect of fully engaged sport in the matches itself. Eastwood also, as ever, takes plenty of time out for reflective silence and rumination with some obvious exposition inserts too, no doubt with the American viewer in mind (say, how does this extra-time work again?).Still, it had to be said he does a relatively good job with an assignment which must have been somewhat alien to him and pays proper respect to one of the more notable sporting and national triumphs of recent times.",6,0,0,16 October 2015
La La Land," Lost in Hollywood
","My wife and I were really looking forward to watching this Oscar-festooned movie. I personally love Golden Age Hollywood musicals and had read all the press about its revamping the genre for the present - day. Somehow though it just didn't connect with us.I did like the cinematography with its Hopper-like depiction of low-rent Hollywood, from film-sets to restaurants and jazz-clubs. There were no sex-scenes, the camera work was fluid throughout and I appreciated the references to the past with the old-style titles and old-fashioned scene-changes too.But after that, I struggled to relate to the characters. Ryan Gosling's character is determined to make his actress girl-friend like jazz and by extension the viewer but I know what I like and I didn't warm to the live club scenes with Gosling immersing himself in his music. Likewise Stone's travails with her acting ambitions as she flunks screen-tests and takes a waitress job as she seeks her big break. I didn't hate them, I just didn't care for them. The songs were okay I guess but sitting here a day after watching it, none of them is still in my memory. The set-piece choreographed numbers are likewise easy on the eye but again aren't particularly memorable especially compared to those from yesteryear. Gosling and Stone are okay in their roles and work hard at their singing and dancing but I didn't sense much chemistry between them. I certainly didn't think I was watching Hollywood's best actress of the year. It probably helps to like and appreciate characters like this if you're in the entertainment industry otherwise they can come across, as here, as precious and vain.Maybe I'm being too critical in invoking the great films it seems to draw upon for inspiration but the fact that it got decorated with six Oscars the other day for me says something about the quality of competition today compared to earlier times.No, if I want to see a movie about a struggling jazz musician and his ambitious girlfriend, I'll go back and watch 'New York New York'.",5,15,24,11 March 2017
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Big trouble in the Big Apple
","My wife and I are just back from five days in New York and even though this movie was made 25 years ago, with so many of its landmarks unchanged, it certainly enhanced our enjoyment of the film especially as we'd somehow never seen it before.Watching it on the run-up to Christmas helped too but the fact of the matter is that the movie's highly entertaining and enjoyable anyway. I get that McCauley Culkin's goofy grin, floppy hair, big ears plus of course that scream of his might irritate some but I otherwise found all these plus his smartness and rebelliousness quite acceptable.I enjoyed the way the writer and director, knowing that this is a sequel bound to end up with the same slap-sticky, booby-trapped conclusion as its mega-successful predecessor found a clever and even credible way to separate Kevin again from his family. I loved the New York winter locations while on the acting side, I equally enjoyed the cameo as toy-store owner Mr Duncan by veteran Eddie Bracken, who starred in so many great Preston Sturges films of the 40's. John Williams also delivers a playful soundtrack in keeping with the frivolities depicted on the screen.In these and other ways, director Chris Columbus harks back to those Golden Age Hollywood days, not by coincidence is 'It's A Wonderful Life' referenced again in one of his movies, but here too he contributes a lasting seasonal classic which I dare say will likewise be watched and enjoyed by families at Yule time down the years.",7,1,2,23 December 2017
Up," High marks
","Another enjoyable Pixar production right here, this time doing for the elderly what 'Toy Story' did for infants. It does fall a bit too obviously into the formulaic last half hour big chase with the bad guy, which in this particular feature I think was going along perfectly well as it was. Maybe that's just the adult in me, so I'll chalk up the first half of the film for me and the second half for the kiddies.I particularly liked the prologue in which we get the potted life story of Carl and Ellie, the film subtly making the point that life goes on even when you're old and widowed. I might argue that the feisty Ellie character actually seemed to have more going for her than her more passive husband and that I missed her in the second half. I also didn't appreciate the fact that it was their childhood hero and inspiration who turned out to be the baddie and of course cuteness must have its place in any Disney feature and here we get a double dose with Doug the dog and Kevin the err...big bird.However the crotchety old Carl Fredricksen is a fine creation and even more so his keen-as-mustard adventure scout assistant, Russell, the film also reminding us that the generation gap needn't be so wide. While there are fun moments and good laughs to be had, I was most taken with the marvellous animation, as so often is the case with Pixar. In particular the scene of the first ascent of the house with its multicoloured balloons sending it skywards is a visual treat (it's a pity they give this away in the promotional material) as are the first, rainbow-tinged views of Adventure Falls. The vocal characterisations are excellent, with Ed Asner as frosty old coot Carl and young Jordan Nagai as young whippersnapper Russell while the background music is likewise enjoyable and apt.In summary then, another Pixar treat, although like I said from a purely selfish point of view, I do wish they would abandon the routine mini-Indiana Jones big finish, no matter how flashy and superficially thrilling it might be.",7,1,1,31 March 2012
Where Eagles Dare," The eagles have landed
","I came to this movie after reading author Alastair MacLean's novelisation of the film, not realising that unlike earlier film adaptations of his books, this time the film came first. Actually I preferred the book anyway as for me both Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood didn't suggest themselves to me as the actors who would portray Commander Smith and Major Schaffer. In fact I'd argue that they're both miscast anyway, Burton is way too old and bulky for an action movie of this type and Eastwood is too taciturn and cold in his part, probably killing more Germans than the words of dialogue he speaks. There's no real sense of camaraderie between them either.The story is naturally reminiscent of the writer's earlier success 'The Guns Of Navarone', being another seemingly impossible mission to an impregnable location by a small team of crack soldiers, led by an older man with of course treachery in the air within and without the group itself. There are lots of derring action sequences including several explosions, car chases and especially the climactic scenes on top of a descending cable-car, however Eastwood's own wry rechristening of the film as 'Where Doubles Dare' is borne out in almost every scene of exertion or danger as the director invariably cuts to stunt men and women in bulked up weatherproof gear, shot from the back to mask their features.In supporting roles, I liked the work of Mary Ure and Derren Nesbitt better than the leads, the former as the utility girl who secretly joins the group, the latter as a high-ranking Aryan- looking S.S. Captain but Peter Barkworth for one is wasted, barely speaking a line as one of the minor members of the team, he was of course later put to better use in this kind of setting in the BBC's long-running TV series 'Colditz'.The body count is pretty high throughout with the Germans as usual in films like this inexplicably missing our heroes when it's easier to shoot them, plus there are a number of jarringly obvious old-fashioned process shots in the days before green-screen. It's still a decent actioner evocatively shot in winter against a dramatic Alpine backdrop, but, like Burton in the lead role, it does rather show its age at times.",6,2,3,14 November 2017
Total Recall," Partial success
","Apparently the last of the pre-CGI blockbusters, which means everything and everyone you see, at least in one sense are real. Therefore it's perhaps unfair to judge it by modern day standards, but it has to be said that all the blood (and there's lots of it) looks like tomato ketchup, the fight scones look very fake and much of the make up effects look like grafted on rubber. Then there's the perennial question, how do you solve a problem like Arnie? He plainly can't act, get into character or even say a line without giving the appearance he's memorised it the minute before. Well, like my brother says, you make a singer who can't dance look like they can by surrounding them with good dancers and while it's arguable director Paul Verheuven does that with the quality of acting here, there is a terrific Philip K Dick storyline playing out in the background, not to mention some memorable scenes and visual effects for good measure.The idea of replacing a man's memories for me is a fascinating one and one that reminded me of Dennis Potter's excellent TV drama 'Karaoke' from around the same time starring Albert Finney. Of course, the finesse in the story is blockbustered away by Schwarzenegger's action hero status which effectively means that the long middle part of the movie is one extended chase sequence, but the movie does hint at a degree of intelligence after all by giving us a slightly enigmatic 'Inception'-like finish.The most memorable SFX undoubtedly involve make-up and the use of prosthetic masks, like when Arnold's impersonation of a lady tourist comes unstuck at the space station and when he and Melina's facial features nearly explode when they come into contact with the Martian atmosphere. Verheuven directs most of the movie seemingly through a red filter giving a suitably other-worldly sheen to events.Sure the direction is often flashy, occasionally crude and repetitive (try counting the number of dead bodies, smashed windows and trashed cars and you'll get the general drift), but there's no doubt it's an entertaining movie which helped propel Shwarzeneggar to top box office status for the rest of the 90's.",6,0,2,3 September 2016
Limitless," On-limits
","A pounding and indeed relentless up-to-the-minute thriller with its own unique insight into the burn-out behind high-fliers in the finance world; apparently it's all due to a new, unofficially available pill which frees the mind. For Bradley Cooper's schmucky-loser, it becomes a life-changing revelation, making him immediately brilliant in business, an expert in self-defence and of course, a hit with the ladies. Cue lots of directorial devices, such as deep-perspective tracking shots, cut-up scenes and interspersing dialogue. It's a good premise for a sci-fi thriller and the first hour is great as Cooper embarks on his rags to riches trip, discovering the potency of the drug in his everyday life.Unfortunately, it gets too silly from there on as he gets involved with a Slavic gangster who wants in on the act taking the last third into sub-Terminator territory with too much violence and gore and letting down the promise of what had gone before. Cooper is good in what is basically a split-personality role, half strung-out waster, half suited and booted fast-talking whizz-kid. Robert DeNiro does his usual professional job as the biggest shark in the pool, reining in any Pacino-like excess and playing it straight. More could have been made of the slightly underwritten female parts which reaches some sort of nadir when Cooper's wife pops a pill to become Sigourney Weaver long enough to escape the bad guy in a tight spot.In the final reckoning, if the writer and director had avoided the predilection for mindless violence, a modern-day parable about the excesses of capitalism albeit mixed up with a sci-fi and thriller ethos was within reach, but it really let itself down by pandering to the body-count requirement of teenagers who I guess put bums on seats.",5,2,3,18 February 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," The dark night...
","Talk about your long dark night of the soul. This is a deliberately unsettling exploration of jealousy, sexual curiosity and deviance masked under a morality tale against adultery and drug-taking...I think. Kubrick's very adult film takes us into the world of successful New York doctor Tom Cruise ('Dr Bill Harford') and Nicole Kidman and from the simple opening of them leaving their infant child in the charge of their baby-sitter to attend a glitzy Christmas party hosted by the mega-rich Sydney Pollack, sees them subject to sexual temptation with third parties (two for one in Cruise's case) from which they just about extricate themselves. However, post-party and back in their own bed, we see them smoking a joint and gradually fashion an argument, culminating in Kidman's shocking admission to her husband about a sexual fantasy she had over a soldier some time before, even when in her husband's company. One surprise call for Cruise to attend the death of his old mentor gives him the opportunity to explore his darker side and attempt to expiate the vision of Kidman and her fantasy love which fuels his actions.I can't claim to understand the many facets of this strong film but was certainly held from one discomfiting scene to the next. First Cruise is almost seduced by the grieving daughter of the dead man whom he's attending, then he similarly pulls back from a liaison with a kindly (as it turns out very kindly prostitute) thanks to a timely phone call from his wife, before finally his curiosity and motivations get the better of him and he gate-crashes a sinister masqued orgy where apparently anything goes but in truth all is carefully orchestrated, monitored and controlled. On the way though, he witnesses a troubling situation at the fancy-dress shop whose owner he gets up after hours to furnish him with the required disguise for the ball, with the owner's obviously barely pubescent daughter is caught almost in-flagrante with what appears to be a father and son Oriental pair.The centrepiece of the film and the one that perhaps demonstrates Kubrick's powers most is the orgy scene. A deliberately constructed long slow tease of a scene with the viewer made to follow Cruise's subjective voyeuristic gaze as he wanders through the plush, massive rooms of the secret mansion, witnessing sexual acts performed in dumb show for the specially invited guests to a backdrop of a gloomy but haunting piano refrain. Thus we the viewer feel the danger of the faceless Mr Big who catches Cruise out in his deception who to protect the anonymity and exclusivity of his 'parties' that he will extract the highest price to deter interlopers in the future.I found myself carried along uneasily on Cruise's coat-tails and of course are made to examine our own morality and sexual mores and even as it seems both Cruise may have just about learned his lesson, that shocking last word on camera of Kidman's perhaps gives the lie to that. Of course it could all have been a drug-fuelled dream/nightmare of Cruise's, which would help explain the enigmatic title of the movie...Both leads are very good in what must have been difficult parts to play, especially as they were of course married at the time. The support players were all as significant but unobtrusive as they needed to be. However it's in the orchestration of the set, actors, lighting, camera movement and music that one sees a great director at work. I doubt I could have been persuaded subject matter like this without knowing that the likes if Kubrick was behind the camera.As it happened, it turned out of course to be his last movie and what a demanding, challenging, even risky one it turned out to be. While I couldn't argue it as the best movie in his oeuvre, it is obviously the work of a major talent and testimony that he maintained his considerable powers to the end.",8,2,3,28 May 2011
Inside Man," Flaccid update of 70's heist movies
","For me an unsatisfactory, unconvincing heist movie. With an A-List cast, particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like Spike Lee I was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub-genre. For a start I didn't like the pacing of the film, starting off with mastermind Clive Owen's raison d'etre piece to camera, unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion, then finding the narrative peppered with confusing, not to say unreal-seeming witness interviews, then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier. Of course the camera work is fluid throughout, constantly on the move and incorporating hand-camera shots a-plenty, but director Lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense, falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film. Denzel Washington is weighed down with the clothes and bad-ass jive talk of a 'Shaft' movie thirty - five years earlier (he even has that 'no-one understands him but his woman' thing going on, replete with his 'hot' girlfriend, baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate 'dirty-talk') and his mild 'In The Heat Of The Night' riff with Willem Defoe (in almost a bit-part) raises barely a ripple. Clive Owens plays his character with a resolutely English accent even as we're given to believe the gang is Arab-based, also hindered by having to play 90% of the film with a mask over his face. Jodie Foster delivers another of her patented tight-lipped, ice maiden, sub-Clarice Starling turns as a well connected financial bounty-hunter, if you will, to little effect. Overall it's a real mish-mash of a film, with a light but obvious twist at the end, in fact the title gives it away from the start, spoiler fans. Worst scene (of many) is undoubtedly Washington's witness-interview, unbelievably, with an 8 year old street-kid, although Owen's dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes. During the film in-joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like 'Serpico' and 'Dog Day Afternoon' - but there's no honour in self-praise. More like 'The Hot Rock' instead...and even that was good for a few laughs.",4,1,4,10 February 2008
Jack Reacher," Out of Reacher
","I'm not familiar with the Lee Childs' novels on the Jack Reacher character but I do remember the media hoopla over the rather diminutive Tom Cruise being cast as a plus 6' male. The other just-as-important matter for consideration is whether he can carry off such a tough-as-nails persona. I know you could argue that Ethan in the Mission Impossible franchise is similarly indestructible but I don't think even that characterisation calls for the sheer cussedness of Reacher here and in the end I think he falls short (no pun intended).The film starts off with an intriguing set-up as a lone assassin, in a scenario too sadly familiar from real life, ruthlessly guns down five apparently random people. However a series of perhaps too obvious clues leads to an ex-military marksman being arrested for the crime who breaks his silence only to reach out (sorry!) for Reacher to come to his aid.From there though it goes down a rather predictable set of paths which I personally doubt would be as written in the novel, like the way Reacher takes down five toughs sent to scare him off the scent in the now familiar ninja-style from any number of Marvel / DC movies or even TV series or the inevitable car chase through the night streets of Pittsburgh. I had also guessed the killer's M.O. too although there's a satisfaction of course in so doing.I also felt that the conclusion in the driving rain as Reacher, with the unlikely help of mean and ornery target range owner Robert Duvall faces off against the Mr Big, his right-hand man and assorted henchmen, as you'd expect taking them down one by one until there were none as the saying goes. Personally I felt a little awkward seeing Duvall's trigger-happy character being lionised as he was, in this day and age.In the final analysis I felt I'd have probably preferred to read the source novel more than watch this Hollywood blown-up version. I was entertained but too many of the situations and characterisations seemed hackneyed, repetitive and derivative for me to really savour what I had hoped would be a grittier detective drama and not just the outsized actioner it proved to be in the end.",5,0,0,22 July 2018
Thor," Thor he's a jolly good fellow
","Being more of a DC comics guy myself, I know little more about Thor other than he has big hair, a big cape and a big hammer. I suppose he's as close as Marvel got to a Superman- type hero, but with more angst, as expelled for youthful bravado in confronting his home world Asgard's old enemies the Frost Kings, he finds himself exiled on Earth,where he quickly (too quickly in my opinion) goes native there, getting caught up in defying the authorities and falling for Natale Portman.The film itself entertains with its sword and sorcery plot-line and neatly contrasts the fantastical world of Asgard and Jottenheim with modern-day America. The story of sibling rivalry is as old as the Old Testament and creates suitable tension in the narrative, while Anthony Hopkins presides over his sons' feuding with the necessary gravitas.The action sequences are especially well done, including the first battle with the Frost Giants, Loki's dispute with Haemdell and especially Thor and his band's fight with the seemingly invincible Destroyer. The c-gen SFX are suitably dream-scape in scale, particularly the depiction of the Bifrost Rainbow Bridge.The acting is serviceable rather than memorable, only Hopkins making you look more at him than the scenery behind him and while I understand the interpolation of S.H.I.E.L.D for continuity reasons leading up to the Avengers movie, for me they were still a distracting presence.All told though, this more grounded super-hero movie was better suited to my taste than those aimed closer at the lucrative market for 13 year old viewers of others of the same ilk.",7,0,0,9 May 2012
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a wonderful film
","A must watch, best on Christmas Day preferably, Capra's evergreen classic will surely stir hearts and emotions so long as there are eyes and ears and hearts and minds to drink it all in.Incredible to think it was a commercial failure on first release and indeed was the great director's last recognised masterpiece of a long, distinguished career. The story, of course, is pure 'Capra-corn', the last word in his trademark straight-guy-takes-on-big-bad-world M.O. and who through demonstrating his own sheer humanity overcomes adversity to restore our collective faith in human nature.I've seen it many times previously, but not for a long while, yet still had to wipe away a tear at the gladdening conclusion as Everyman James Stewart's George Bailey gets his just rewards for a lifetime of good intentions and good deeds and so overturns the machinations of the grasping local tyrant, Henry Potter, played with almost pantomime relish by Lionel Barrymore.The writing is wonderful, (people forget the playful humour which abounds in the early sections), Capra taking time slot in all the components, before the breathtaking twist which sees George's careless remark, as he turns his back on the world, fanned into flame by his angel overseer, Clarence, played beautifully by Henry Travers. As ever, Capra manages his ensemble cast of familiars with aplomb, but still leaves plenty of room for Stewart's wonderful performance to occupy centre-stage. Yes, the viewer's emotions are manipulated occasionally (for example,the heavenly choir is heard in the background, for all of the last 10 or 15 minutes), but Capra by and large reins in the schmaltz and leaves you thinking that the 'wonderful town' of Bellfield Falls could have actually existed in some between-wars long-ago time and placeAlthough not completely perfect (let's not forget Potter effectively gets away with Bailey's Bank's depositors' hard-earned money), Capra's universal parable will surely forever continue to maintain its pre-eminent position as a true Hollywood classic, for all seasons.",10,0,3,25 December 2010
The Departed," Leaving the building...
","Scorcese's first comment on his old pet theme, gangsters and their world, for some time and the question is can the veteran director still deliver in the grand style of, say 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino'. For me however, this movie doesn't hit the mark of its illustrious predecessors and seems to me to lack that particular 'Scorcese touch', if anything playing out like any other contemporary mob thriller you can see on TV as well as on the big screen. Of course it's distinguished by A-List actors but none of them quite delivers that knockout punch in terms of performance. De Caprio is certainly edgy and committed in his central role as the inside man, the left-hand to Ray Winstone's surprisingly almost anonymous right-hand man to mob leader Jack Nicholson, whilst the great ham himself (sorry, I'm not a fan) is kept mostly in check, keeping his eye-rolling and exaggerated speechifying more or less under control, even if Scorcese does hand him an unnecessary 'Here's Johnny' / 'I didn't ask' moment with a 'This ain't reality TV' crack. Matt Damon, even though more associated with heroic male lead parts (c.f. Jason Bourne) has played baddies before (most memorably in 'The Talented Mr Ripley'), and convinces as Nicholson's man on the inside, but in the end I found this and the other considerable star-power on display (Wahlberg, Sheen, Baldwin et. al.) distracting from the drama. Vera Farmiga is competent, no more than that, as the love interest to both Damon and DeCaprio in an underwritten and unbelievable role as the police shrink. In a movie where the four main leads are not what they seem and engaging in different ways in deception and deceit, be it on a large scale (De Caprio, Damon and allegedly Nicholson) or a strictly personal scale (Farmiga), I think a clearer more believable narrative would have improved matters. The action set pieces are okay and rightly rooted in reality but some of the events are implausible to say the least (Martin Sheen as a senior investigator with the police gets unceremoniously thrown off a high rise building, then everybody else more or less gets shot just before the final reel where avenging angel Wahlberg, cleans up affairs by taking out in-the-clear Damon to bring about some degree of closure to the carnage which has gone on before), but I was frustrated at plot holes which threw me off-track and were not I believe fully resolved or compensated for dramatically. And just what place vintage early 70's music by the likes of the Stones (okay, we know why they had two tracks included - obviously Marty isn't above pitching for a gig with prospective employers), Lennon, the Beach Boys and even Badfinger have with an up to the minute contemporary thriller, is anyone's guess, great tracks as they are. All in all a frustrating watch and proof to me that the Academy can be beholden to sympathy and sentimentality in rewarding perseverance over the individual accomplishment of the job in hand. Okay, so maybe Scorcese's Oscar could be taken as a sop for the unrewarded 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', the afore-mentioned 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', not forgetting my own favourite 'New York New York', - but I thought that's what lifetime achievement awards were for...!",6,0,2,28 April 2008
Die Hard," Christmas hijackers.
","Casting about in December for an alternative Christmas film to watch, to my surprise, saw this at number two in a magazine-list of the 50 greatest Festive films ever. Mind you quote what the body-count here contributes to the season of goodwill to all men is open to interpretation. Still, for thrills, stunts and spectacle 'Die Hard' certainly delivers, less so for characterisation, plot and credibility, although I suppose it was ever thus for action blockbusters like this. Bruce Wilis advances into the heavyweight corner with his performance here, even if his wise-cracking persona seems to have carried over from 'Moonlighting', although where he picked up his pliability and durability along the way, again is anybody's guess. I liked Willis in 'Moonlighting' so it's not surprising I like him here. His John McClane is capable it seems of startling feats of death-defying derring-do, but at least he gets there from an inauspicious start when he initially seems terrified and clueless as to how to cope with the heist situation. He squares off well against smooth, metronomic, but sadistic Alan Rickman, in his first big movie role, as the robber's leader proves a good foil. The stunts are excellent, although the soundtrack and fashions have dated poorly. Nevertheless, the action steams ahead from almost the start and rarely lets up thereafter, Bruce working his way through what looks like a bunch of try-outs for 80's hairbands. At various points I picked up on Christmas in the background, even if the film as a whole has little to do with the traditional festive spirit . Still, I watched it all the way through and even though I'm more a Jimmy Stewart /Cary Grant man around this time of year, I can see how it came to define a whole sub-genre of 80's blockbuster.",6,4,6,11 December 2012
Jersey Boys," Valli of tears
","I had really wanted to see the original stage musical instead but welcomed the chance to see the film version although I did have my reservations, particularly over the choice of Clint Eastwood as director and the use of unknowns in the lead singing parts. I'm afraid both my qualms proved valid and I ended up not enjoying the movie as much as I expected to.The story of the Four Seasons background rise to fame wasn't that well-known beforehand I guess, but even though it has its intrigues and tragedies, it doesn't feel strong enough on which to hang a narrative, not helped, as I said, by the rather character-less actors who get to play the individual group members. Yes, there's a bit of scandal, criminality, infidelity and even death occurring along the way, but these seem to slow down the action somewhat an never really engage the viewer's attention. I also felt that too few songs were used - where were 'Let's Hang On', 'I've Got You Under My Skin', 'C'mon Marianne' and others?Octogenarian Eastwood, better known as a jazz-lover struggles to impart the youthfulness and zest of the heady days of the early 60's, plus he gives little sense of the changing times socially and culturally. Indeed the direction is painfully flat at times and frequently goes on for way too long without a musical interlude. The actors fail to transcend their leaden boots and even over-the-top cameos by the likes of Christopher Walken fail to add a spark.As for the music, the songs are great, the singing and staging of same, less so. The decision to run Valli's solo hit 'My Eyes Adored You' is reluctantly forced into the plot, even though it was actually recorded several years after the main time-frame essayed here.I do wish I had nicer things to say about the film, but the simple truth is it just doesn't fly at all. I'll still go to the theatre to see the stage-show if it ever hits my town, but I'm afraid this rather routine Hollywood bio-pic seems to me to rather fail it's subject.",5,1,1,10 November 2014
The Holiday," Holiday from hell
","My toes have just about uncurled enough to free me to diss this over-sentimental piece of tosh. There's a fine art, I believe, in concocting a classic Christmas movie, but the best of them - 'It's A Wonderful Life', 'The Bishop's Wife', 'Miracle on 34th Street' etc, all manage it by being natural and unforced, showing real people in real situations, but their lives overtaken in one way or another by that unclassifiable Christmas spirit.The so-called fare on show here is however so calculated and lacking in good humour (in every sense of the phrase) that what's left is an overwrought, overplayed, overdone piece of contrived hokum.Quite how an ordinary member of the public is meant to relate to high-flying movie-trailer producer Cameron Diaz in her all mod cons dream house, replete with swimming pool and electric curtains, or publishing executive Jude Law as a grieving widower, Jack Black as a cuckolded movie soundtrack composer or even the most downbeat character, Kate Winslet as a lovelorn journalist but still somehow lives in a picturesque cottage in Surrey, is beyond me. And if the answer to that question is meant to be the persuasive talents of the actors on show, then that's another miss as far as I'm concerned. Diaz gets to wig out as per usual to a rock track (likewise Winslet) and how she can't cry anymore, Law gets to gush stuff and nonsense about his doting kids, Winslet builds up an unbelievable with a decrepit sardonic old Hollywood screenwriter and Black tags after a younger model playing him for a fool, in between composing saccharine music for the big screen. Cue Hans Zimmer's completely bland muzak, which seems to get turned on and up whenever A BIG SCENE arises.Cringe-worthy scene follows cringe-worthy scene as all ends happily ever after with the final images of the happy couples partying down with as much phony conviction as they can muster.Really, I could go on and on, but this is about as cynical and hokey as Hollywood gets in going after the big Christmas buck. There are a host of wonderful Christmas movies out there and not just the Golden Age classics I mentioned at the outset - Bill Murray's 'Scrooged' for one. I haven't seen such a bad film in such a long time and can only recommend that if you decide to watch it, imbibe in a whole lot of Christmas spirits beforehand. Unfortunately, being teetotal, I had no such release and suffered accordingly!",1,2,4,21 March 2010
Love Actually," Love Comes to Everyone
","The Richard Curtis I like is the man behind the big belly-laughs in TV's 'Black Adder' and 'Vicar Of Dibley'. Quite how he morphed into the purveyor of ludicrous, over-sentimental tosh like this I'll never know, although I think the lure of the mighty dollar might have had something to do with it.Mixing the supposed 'feel-good' factor of a latter-day Christmas film to an overblown hymn to love, while meant no doubt to induce a warm feeling inside, instead turned my insides out. Here in a Britain about a million miles detached from reality, Cupid's little arrows strike out at everyone from the prime minister himself to porn actors and even, God bless, the little children. It's all set to a corny soundtrack, a new song on every two minutes or so it seems, usually consisting of poor cover versions of standards.I don't know which set of cooing couples I thought the least of, but for sheer sickliness, the exchanges between Liam Neeson and his 10 going on 40 year old son take some beating. Worst scene though, in an overcrowded category, has to be Emma Thompson silently over-emoting as she realises her husband is thinking of having an affair. I wish Dorothy Parker hadn't already coined the phrase about running the gamut of acting emotions from A to B, although I'm not sure Miss Thompson even got past A, so toe-curlingly embarrassing is her 'big' scene.Honestly, to these eyes and ears, not one actor shines, although as I think I've made clear, I believe the fault is in the writing. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, loads of ham acting and a direction style which tries to lead you by the nose to Christmas nirvana. No, this Christmas turkey can go and get stuffed as far as I'm concerned, its one small saving grace being that it singularly failed to launch former soap star Martine McCutcheon to movie stardom. Well, that would certainly be high up on my Christmas wish-list any old year.",2,2,4,11 April 2010
Burlesque," Diva death-match
","Take a little 'Fame', a bit more 'Chicago', a little bit more 'Dreamgirls' and a lot more 'Cabaret', mix them all up, serve cold and hey presto - 'Burlesque' a really very clichéd, stereotypical movie musical featuring divas from the past and present in the personae of Cher and Christina Aguilera.You name it, almost every stock character and situation you can think of in this context is worked in and to death, the young, talented wannabe singer, her backstage, bitchy rival, the older Teflon-tough mother-hen club-owner with a heart of gold, her gay, sympathetic, through-thick-and-thin assistant manager, the grasping, super-rich property magnate out to buy out the failing club and the handsome, sympathetic barman who wouldn't you know it, is a gifted songwriter with a long-time, long-distance fiancé who puts up the young singer with predictable results. The story really itself from all of the above in a wholly predictable manner which would be all very well if it was well acted, staged and acted but unfortunately it isn't. Cher's face us so botoxed that she can only just make her lips move to speak, Aguilera tries hard, way too hard, to impress leaving just Stanley Tucci to steal most of his scenes as everyone's shoulder-to-cry-on.Like the aforementioned 'Dreamgirls', the songs just aren't strong enough either and fail to lodge themselves in the memory in any way. When Aguilera's boy-friend near the end finally presents her with the big song he's been holding back for her, it's just a formulaic sub-disco effort. Moreover, it's ridiculous for Aguilera to make her big pitch to Cher by pleading to actually sing rather than lip-synch on the club stage, only for her to proceed to lip-synch all her own songs from then on.The production numbers too lack the snap and imagination of 'Chicago', never mind anything Bob Fosse ever created, leaving the film a rather empty construct, filled with paper-thin characters and a happy ending constructed, literally out of thin air.This I'm afraid is one cabaret you don't want to come to.",3,1,3,24 July 2016
To Kill a Mockingbird," Yes indeed-o!
","Wonderful film version of the classic Harper Lee, correct in practically every detail. The decision to film in black and white, the recreation of Depression Era Alabama, the individual casting, sure-footed direction and above all, the acting itself, in particular by Gregory Peck and the two young child actors (neither of whom, surprisingly, seemed to stay long in films thereafter) playing his children, all come together in this deservedly much-loved film.The film takes some time to come to the main plot strand, being the trial of the young black man Tom Robinson, but in so doing takes us firmly into the children's world from whose viewpoint the events will be mainly shown and of course subtly introducing the Boo character whose presence will have more resonance later on.Although the film is measured in its progress, taking as long to get going as Peck's Atticus Finch takes to finish a sentence, nary a shot is wasted, although as a dog-owner myself I could have done without the scene where he shoots dead the rabid dog menacing the neighbourhood, but many others stay in the memory, like when Atticus (with Scout's unwitting assistance) defends Robinson against a lynch-mob, Robinson's emotionally-charged testimony in court, the 'victim's' redneck father spitting in Atticus's face and of course the climactic scene when the children's saviour is revealed at the end.Peck deservedly won the Oscar for his commanding performance as the imperturbable Atticus and as I said earlier I don't think I've ever seen better child-acting by the three here. A subtly evocative and provocative movie showing Holloywood film-making at its best, one can't help but think it may have had some impact on public opinion in the then Civil Rights debate in early 60's America.",9,0,1,19 December 2015
A Hard Day's Night," A Day In Their Lives
","Just passed its 50th anniversary now, 'A Hard Day's Night' remains a fresh and exuberant film capturing the energy and spirit of the young Beatles as they get through a typical day of travelling, press-conferences and musical appearances. Interspersed are several of the group's numbers, some are from past singles and albums while most are from the newly- minted soundtrack album and containing such new classics as the title track and smash single 'Can't Buy Me Love', 'And I Love Her' and 'If I Fell'.The movie is slightly fleshed out by the ten minute concert at the end but before that the boys are given ample acting opportunity at which they acquit themselves surprisingly well given it's their collective debut. Yes, there's a touch of stereotyping in their respective personae, the rebellious Lennon, romantic Paul, deadpan George and sullen Ringo, but it's also possible to detect some likely improvisation by them, which only adds to the overall spontaneity. Writer Alun Owen has a good ear for the Liverpool vernacular and inserts some neat jokes although I could have done with less of Wilfred Brambell's meddlesome role as Paul's grandfather. The running joke about him being very clean wouldn't have been lost on British viewers who knew Brambell better as the 'dirty old man' Steptoe Senior character from TV's 'Steptoe and Son'.Director Richard Lester does his task with invention and vigour, his camera rarely standing still and employing several tricks to play up the gags and boost the story. Even unintentional goofs, like George falling over in the initial scene which has the group escaping their Beatlemaniac fans and later backing into his amplifier on a later song only add to the fun. Quite what John Lennon's wife of the time made of his woman-chasing screen-demeanour is anyone's guess however.What's good for me as a fan though is to see the Beatles as near as possible in their natural environment, obviously enjoying their success and each other's company at the same time. The group harmony wouldn't last but it did long enough for them to ultimately ditch both the outlets of cinema and live performances in pursuit of musical excellence, the right choice of course as things panned out.",7,0,0,23 July 2014
Downfall," Bunker mentality
","Remember the old TV programme from the 70's 'You were There', putting the young viewer seemingly at the scene of a historical event - well this movie does that for adults, the authenticity aided of course by the characters conversing in the native German language. The movie of course has to walk a thin line between humanising these infamous characters from history without eliciting sympathy for any of them and succeeds by playing it straight. The only characters from the Nazi camp you really feel for are the innocent Goebbels children in one of the most chilling scenes when their mother, with her husband, the most ardent Nazi of all, who cannot see a place in the future for her infant offspring if the Third Reich fails and silently administers their poison pills after they have been drugged to sleep. The film interestingly does not hold back in its depiction of the real- life horror of the situation, many suicides for example are graphically rendered while contrastingly the camera pans away from the suicides of Hitler, Braun and the Goebbels. The drama also depicts life for ordinary Germans outside the bunker caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place, slaughtered either by their hardline SS countrymen or the invading Russian Red Army, focusing in particular on one small child who sees carnage all around him but comes together at the end with Hitler's idealistic young secretary who cannot offer the ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction taken by so many of the bunker's co-habitants. The performances are uniformly excellent, Bruno Ganz conveying Hitler's detached psychopathy in his crazed outbursts and yet still able to captivate the young pretty socialite Eva Braun. Cult of personality indeed. Best performance for me though is that by Corinna Farhouch as Mrs Goebbels, a striking character study of misguided devotion to an abhorrent creed. The creation of the battle-ravaged heart of Berlin is excellently done with several attention-grabbing images which ingrain themselves in the memory. Would it have been better shot in black and white just to complete the realism, however? Perhaps, but that's a minor gripe in what is ultimately a tautly told lesson from history.",8,1,2,27 November 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Tartan army tale
","Gripping but incongruous movie, juxtaposing a naive, opportunistic and above all else randy young fictional Scottish doctor, played with brio by newcomer James McAvoy - nice to hear a real Scottish accent for a change (are you listening Johnny Depp?), as counterpoint to too-true-to-life despot and dictator Idi Amin. Amin is up there (or should that be down there) with fellow tyrants like Pol Pot and Mugabe in committing heinous sins against his own people, and Forrest Whitaker brings out the child-like monster of his character at one moment enjoying a football kickabout the next ordering the torture and disappearance of imagined political rivals. The film is carried by the two leads, both excellent but I found the grafting on of the fictional thriller-type escape of McAvoy at the end out of synch with the truthfully exposed brutalities of Amin. You care more for the thousands of Ugandans you know died during Amin's bloody reign than for a made-up character ultimately symbolic of nothing. A similar ploy was engaged in the recent TV mini - series 'Rome' where it seemed to work much better in my view but nevertheless this is a brave film on a difficult subject shedding light on yet another 20th century monster 'of the people'. Mr Mugabe are you watching?",6,2,3,24 September 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," TV winner
","Everywhere I turn just now, I'm confronted by an advertisement for 'Anchorman 2'. Never having seen the original, I took the chance to watch it on TV to try and see what the fuss was about. Well, I'm pleased to say I thoroughly enjoyed it and laughed loud and long throughout its running time.It probably helps that I grew up watching 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show', the classic early 70's sit-com set in a TV newsroom, in fact my first thought watching this was that Ted Baxter had made a comeback. Not that there's a lot of the sharp, wry humour tat characterised the 'MTM' shows, the humour you get here is mostly broad and low, although its undeniably funny.Principally the movie gets its laughs from the antiquated sexism of the 70's with San Diego's number one TV news anchorman, Ron Burgundy and his little gang of co- presenters on the show seeing their male dominance challenged by a new, pretty and ambitious female, played by Christina Applegate. Cue numerous gratuitous sexist remarks, but before long, Applegate and her new band of female co-workers have turned the tables although before the end, there's the obligatory 'Let's make up and be friendly' resolution occurs in of all things a bear-pit at the zoo.Will Ferrell is good value as the dim but perfectly coiffured Ron and Applegate, who knows a thing or two about crass humour has a ball in her part as his lady-friend / rival, but the whole supporting team have their moments. I liked best the off-the-wall inserts like the accapella version of 'Afternoon Delight' and the TV news-room teams bloodbath showdown and Ron's boys trying to put Applegate off in her first solo newscast.Throw in those pretty awful 70's fashions and some of the worst songs for the soundtrack and to a child of the times like me, this was a real hoot and maybe just maybe, I'll get along to see that sequel. I'm sure it's on somewhere!",7,0,1,19 December 2013
American Gangster," Everything there but something's missing...
","My expectations were high for this movie, not only as it related to a favourite genre, the modern gangster film, but also of course the heavyweight talent bringing it to the screen, Scott, Crowe, Washington et.al. For me it didn't quite exceed the sum of its parts but that said there's much to commend it. The story gets back to front with pace and the scene setting is fine, evoking the required mix of 'French Connection' (namechecked en route), 'Shaft', 'The Godfather' and even more recent films like 'Casino', 'LA Confidential' and 'The Untouchables'. The film however brings little that is new to the party in terms of plotting which is perhaps the main drawback here, we have sort of seen it all before, from the fable of the underdog protégé gangster rising spectacularly through the ranks, to the Mafia-style placement of family at the centre of Mr Big's (Washington's Frank Lucas) universe, to the taking of a trophy wife, to the ritual violence meted out to rivals and subordinates, plus of course the good versus bad cops and robbers routine as unsullied by vice, Crowe plays off against Washington's sinister well oiled criminal machine. The evocation of late 60's New Jersey and New York is well achieved, with language and fashions to match (a negative mark tho' for the too-obvious musical soundtrack motifs, great as they are, slightly more obscure selections from Bobby Womack, Staple Singers and Sam and Dave would have better grounded the movie in its chosen era), but I found the acting just shy of top-notch, certainly not Oscar-worthy. The twin leads, Crowe and Washington aren't stretched and to me, don't stretch themselves enough in their parts, plus it's fair to say they're given few memorable lines to deliver too. I would also have preferred the Crowe character to be more blemish-free to point up the contrast with Washington's don, (why does every divorce defendant in a Hollywood flick end up in a gratuitous sex-scene with their glamorous female attorney?). The Crowe and Washington characters are held back until the conclusion when they actually share a scene, but again fireworks fail to fly and one almost wishes the actors could have turned back the clocks to when they were less knowing about their craft (c.f. Crowe in 'LA Confidential', Washington in 'Philadelphia') and brought more attack to their parts. I'm not sure 'American Gangster' adds much more than a semi-colon, never mind a postscript to the genre and the film does drag on about 20 minutes too long but there's enough grits and style to get by on here.",7,0,2,30 December 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Taxing rom-com...
","Tricksy, would-be cutesy rom-com with a 'Truman Show'/'Sliding Doors' type twist as blue-collar IRS nobody Will Ferrell finds his mundane life manipulated by a mysterious omnipotent 'narrator' towards an ultimately tragic conclusion (at least for him). Problem for me here is the 'com' part as my funny bone steadfastly refused to let itself be tickled by on-screen events and with the extra-dimensional plot having, as indicated, been done before to more credible effect elsewhere, I found the movie ultimately an exercise in futility. Ferrell really needs a Jimmy Stewart or even Bill Murray-type languor to carry off his Average-Guy part while Maggie Gylenhaal is equally unconvincing as a tattooed baker, behind with her taxes (seriously!). You don't get any sense that this unlikely duo could ever get attracted to one another except in a kooky Hollywood movie, then throw in Dustin Hoffman in a by-numbers part as Ferrell's shrink, Emma Thomson as the befuddled author/narrator and Queen Latifah as her P.A. so that it's difficult to highlight whose character is the more useless. In addition, quite why the director sees fit to soundtrack early 80's UK new-wave songs from the likes of The Jam, Clash and the great Wreckless Eric (whose little-known classic 'Whole Wide World' takes centre stage as Ferrell's song to his particular siren), is ultimately as confusing and meaningless as the rest of this slight and unsatisfactory confection. By the end I'm sure I was meant to have a little Capra-type glow and some expansive thoughts on the old free-will versus fate discussion, but honestly, I'd have been more entertained evaluating all this in the dustiest of text-books...",4,1,2,5 January 2009
The Reader," Tough read...
","I wasn't convinced by this so-serious drama which mixes prurience, rites of passage and a study in Nazi-war-crime guilt into an unconvincing whole, unleavened by so-serious acting, praised beyond its station in my opinion.The prurience comes from the first half hour when ailing young German schoolboy, Michael benefits from the kindness (and then some) of a middle-aged female Hanna Schmitz who lives alone in a city centre flat. After his 'Mrs Robinson' moment, it's no time at all before they're bath-deep in a physical relationship, during which Kate Winslet barely keeps her clothes on and reveals a predilection for having literature read aloud to her before the sexual act.The rites of passage element then takes over as sensitive Michael finds pretty young female classmates and students chasing him, causing him to sever his connection with Hanna, although we're at least spared an overblown separation scene (I don't doubt there'll be an excised scene in the DVD extras).The film then changes tack again as Michael, years later and now a legal student who on a very coincidental 'work-experience' visit to a courtroom trial, is astounded to see his old paramour in the dock as the accused ringleader of a group of female ex-Nazi concentration camp guards accused of complicity in the preventable deaths of Jewish prisoners on their watch. Hanna and her Nazi-sisters, you could say!The film concludes by jumping forward yet again as the now adult Michael who we learn has never properly gotten over his feelings for the by now life-imprisoned Hanna, tentatively re-connects with her although it's never in doubt that we're going to get a downbeat ending here.My criticisms are that the film failed to hang together in a narrative sense relying on too many fantastic coincidences to keep the plot moving forward. It's inexplicable for example that a guilt-riddled Hanna, seemingly living a hermit-like existence on her own, could seduce and enter into a physical relationship with a 15 year old boy. I've already commented on the coincidence that brings the two together for the ending and also found fault in the too obvious symbolism of Hanna using her adored books as a stepladder to her own destruction as she nears the date of her release.The acting is deadly serious but I would hesitate to praise the players. Winslet gets to look pained and strained pretty much all the way through and shows her artifice too easily. It seems that Ralph Feinnes has no range beyond haunted and tortured while the young lad playing Michael pretty much exhibits zero charisma. The cinematic rendering of late 50's Berlin does seem realistic, but I was further put off by the jump-around time-frame employed and the overuse of background music in almost, or so it seemed, every scene.Finally, I will comment on the recent vogue in making movies almost apologetic to Nazi collaborators and employees (c.f. 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas'). Here I felt manipulated to sympathise with another 'only obeying orders' retired Nazi guard who incidentally shows not one scintilla of remorse for her actions and who then casually seduces an underage teenager into the bargain. The director may argue that this wasn't the sole aim of the movie, but for me this viewpoint too greatly distorted my viewing pleasure and while I'm obviously in the minority going by the average score of this movie, not to mention the Academy's recognition, have to state that I found the whole a cold, vaguely offensive and certainly overrated piece of cinema.",4,5,9,7 April 2009
Ray," Charles the first
","Stirring, reasonably unflinching if occasionally romanticised bio-pic of R 'n' B giant Ray Charles with a superb impersonation / performance in the lead part by Jamie Foxx. The film charts the singer's rise from the poor black neighbourhood of his youth in the 40's to his Grammy-winning chart-topping peak of the early 60's. Apart from a late 70's epilogue which sees him regain the right to play in Augusta after being banned for refusing to play to segregated audiences there years before, the film ends with Charles back on the up, kicking his heroin habit in the process.There's a lot of story to be told here, between Charles' drug-habit, womanising and performing but occasionally the movie did seem to sag and drag a touch, especially when he's on the road juggling his love-life amongst competing women. However the film doesn't shy from showing his numerous faults although the constant dream/nightmare sequences having us believe all his character defects can be traced back to his witnessing as a young boy the tragic death of his younger brother seems a bit 'Hollywood' to me, a simpler excuse for his excesses probably being that he just couldn't help himself.These scenes, plus regular flashbacks to his mother egging him on as a boy are too fantastical for me and go against the gritty realism of the rest of the movie. Depictions of time and place are well recreated especially Charles' historic recording sessions with Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ehrtegun and his journeys around the 'Chitlin Circuit' of the American South and anytime a song comes on the screen the movie lights up, a combination of great material, great staging and great performing by Foxx.Foxx probably deserved his best actor Oscar as he throws himself fully into the part and does so without sentimentality or hamming it up. The supporting cast is strong too in an almost all-black cast, especially those playing the women in his life.It probably helps enjoyment of the film if you're familiar with Charles' music and even like me, his unconventional true-life story, but it's not really necessary as both the music and the character are so strong as to be almost irresistible.",7,1,2,23 February 2014
The Lion King," Not feeling the love tonight
","Difficult to deny the worldwide success of this Disney animated musical from which already has sprung a sequel, a theatrical show and now, we hear a live-action remake in the near future. And yet watching it for the first time, I'd be lion sorry, lying if I said I thought it was top drawer Disney. I've liked Elton John's music too for many years too but again didn't feel the songs he contributed (with Tim Rice as his lyricist) were his best work even if it did give his career an unexpected boost at the time.So what's not to like...well I struggled a little to side with the ruling Mafusa who when asked why it was okay for lions to eat antelopes, lamely proffered the line that lions turn back into grass when they die which then feeds the antelopes as part of the circle of life...that's not my understanding about evolution in the animal kingdom, where I thought survival of the fittest was the raison d'etre. I know the film is almost 25 years old but I also thought the animation quality wasn't of the highest while the characters repeat stock situations and emotions which Disney still peddles today, i.e. rebellious youngster leaves home before returning to heroically save the day against big bad baddie, in this case Simba's uncle Scar. Oh and of course there are cute side-attractions a-plenty, like the meerkat that thinks it's Groucho Marx, his less-than-sharp wild boar sidekick that definitely isn't a pig and a witch doctor funky gibbon all helping Simba in some way or other. I didn't really think the hyenas who support Scar were especially malevolent either.Maybe I'm just an old stick-in-the-mud but I just didn't think 'The Lion King' lived up to expectations. No worries though or as they say in the film Hakuna Matata.",4,5,9,20 February 2018
Inception," Dream-thievers
","I actually didn't 'get' some of Christopher Nolan's previous movies, like 'Identity' or 'The Prestige' and so was wary of the hype surrounding this blockbuster of his. I'm glad to say that I finally got it this time as this is a spectacular sci-fi thriller with more levels than the Empire State Building, demanding, but rewarding the viewer's full attention throughout.It really impresses in every way possible, the imagination which fires the story, the lucidity with which it's complexity is brought to the screen, the pacing which is relentless throughout, but never wearing and the circular resolution of the story by the end sequence.Yes there are holes in the plot, (like how did Fischer come to be ready for the team's attempt to hijack his memory?) plus the motivation for the elaborateness of the team's plan doesn't convince as it should, but this is an instance of 'trust the teller, not the tale' as, futurist elements part, it rattles along, fuelled by Hans Zimmer's pounding background music.The acting is uniformly good, Di Caprio leading his assorted 'dream-busters' with aplomb, the acting by all executed with razor-sharp timing and conviction, which the story demands. The cinematography and C-Gen SFX are eye-popping, particularly Cobb's first dream-walk with Ariadne, the weightless fight-scene, the train's appearance in city centre traffic and much much more.This film unquestionably is Nolan's best and raises the bar for tech-thrillers in the modern age.It's one dream you won't want to end.",9,0,6,17 March 2012
Defiance," Band of brothers...
","I'm well aware as I write this of the ironic timing of the release of this movie, celebrating the courage and will to live of a group of Belarussian Jews displaced by the Nazi purges of the Second World War at the same time as the state of Israel is being criticised by many areas of the international community for its air-strikes and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, which may in fact adversely affect its box-office potential.That said, this is a story worth telling, especially as I was largely unaware of active resistance by Jews against the monstrous juggernaut of the exterminating Nazis. The movie is hyper-realistic in delivery, the cinematography unstinting in its depiction of the general hand-to-mouth squalor which the travelling band of resistors had to endure, all gloomy greys and browns. No Speilbergian flashes of red here.The acting is generally good, if somewhat one-dimensional throughout, Daniel Craig having just the right stony-face disposition to depict stoically determined 'leader' Tuvia Bielski and as you'd imagine after his 007 training, well up to the physical demands of the role. And yet, he does lack for me a defining spark of personality, which reduces the impact of his performance. The supporting roles are well played too by men and women alike, although it has to be said that there never were three brothers that looked less alike than Messrs Craig, Schreiber and Bell. The movie is of necessity unrelenting as it attempts to convey the day- to-day struggle and fears of discovery of the commune but does for me make too many concessions to Hollywood mores, with the timely insertion of 'big scenes' you can see coming in advance, often clichéd, like the treatment of the renegade who challenges Craig's authority and particularly the pat ending where you just know that Brother Zus is going to come to a cavalry-type rescue of his brother before their inevitable reconciliation.There are some scenes which work better for their lack of sentimentality and predictability, none more so in the shocking scene where Craig allows the angry mob to tear apart a stray German they've captured and also the scene near the beginning where Craig exacts retribution on the traitorous collaborators responsible for the death of his parents. On both occasions, the viewer's sympathies are sufficiently and understandably manipulated to accept and dare I say it condone the barbarism of both acts.Some of my reservations though are unfair perhaps. If I disliked some aspects of the almost 'buddy buddy' relationship of the brothers, the fact is that they were based on real-life brothers and I suppose one has to allow the director some latitude in inserting periodic action or even, (very briefly) romantic scenes as a sop to the entertainment demands of a big-budget movie.In conclusion though, I would have to say that all movies of this type I guess are in the shadow of 'Schindler's List' and I was certainly less moved by this noble effort than I perhaps expected to be, certainly compared to Spielberg's monument. In fact if there's a 'History Channel' documentary available for perusal on this subject (I know there'a a book) perhaps that would be the better way to appreciate the incredible courage of the Jewish resistance fighters depicted here.",7,4,10,10 January 2009
The Good Shepherd," CIA serious
","With a big star cast and big-name actor as director (and I enjoyed De Niro's previous outing behind the cameras 'A Bronx Tale' and an interesting subject-matter I had high hopes for this spy-thriller, but ultimately found myself rather bored and uninterested in the final analysis.The setting up of the CIA and its interaction with British Intelligence and later of course the KGB made for intense viewing but by using a convoluted time-scale with numerous, non- sequential flashbacks, a preponderance of characters and an overlong running-time, it just didn't hold my attention enough. At its heart is a sort of whodunit as the Agency tries to unmask the leak to the Russians which derailed the disastrous US Bay Of Pigs to unseat Castro in Cuba, but you wouldn't need to be Sherlock Holmes to work who the perpetrator is so that I found myself getting ahead of the plot anticipating the inevitable outcome.Interwoven around this are various other plot strands taking in the Cambridge Communist spy-ring in the UK and the identity of a supposed Soviet double-agent, played out to a background of central character Matt Damon' life and times and his tempestuous relationship with his wife, played by Angelina Jolie and difficult connection with his son.For the so-called head of department, however, Damon isn't exactly discreet in his own personal affairs plus he rarely seems to demonstrate either the steely resolve or keen intelligence of someone so highly placed. The movie does have some effective scenes, including three dramatic executions and a shocking water-boarding torture scene obviously redolent of, at the time, recently reported front-line events in Iraq with the US military.The acting rarely rose above the writing in my opinion and while De Niro's direction is adequate and occasionally inventive he really should have edited at least half an hour off the running time and upped the pace generally.In short, a whole much less than the constituent parts.",6,1,2,30 December 2013
Stalag 17," Not so great escape
","I'm a big fan of maestro Wilder's work, but have to admit to very mixed feelings about this concentration camp escape feature. Without even looking at the IMDb notes, I saw straight away the resemblance to the TV-derived 'Hogan's Heroes', right down to dumbkopf Officer Schultz and found the mix of lame humour and gritty drama too much to take.The plot, told in flashback by Willam Holden's resourceful Sefton character's pal Cookie, is naturally episodic, but I was never convinced that these soldiers were drawn from life. The humour is very dated, the episode where the inmates stage their own Christmas Dance being by far the strangest where not only do we get the unseemly sight of soldiers dancing man to man, but one even drags up to impersonate Betty Grable so his chum participates.It does settle down in the last half-hour to a gripping finale as Holden uncovers the truth about the traitor in their midst and a (literally) killing-two-birds-with-one-stone escape plan is put into action (and turns out to be a real 'mission impossible' for a young Peter Graves) but it can't make up for the uneven fare that's gone before.Only Holden really emboldens his character with anything approaching depth, the rest have as much truth about them as Snow White's seven dwarfs.As it boasts in the prologue, this was one of the first stories concentrating (sorry) on POW's but better takes on the subject were to follow, none that I can remember making the mistake of playing it for laughs.",4,2,4,25 June 2012
Music and Lyrics," Wake Me Up Before Hugh Go-Go
","Slightly better than usual Hugh Grant rom-com vehicle which sees him play an ageing, 80's has-been Andrew Ridgley-type popster who gets an unlikely break from the constant round of playing the oldies circuit when he's asked to write a song for the new, hot young Britney / Christina kid-on-the-block. However, rather like, say, Elton John, he doesn't do lyrics and needs to find one fast to complete the new song on deadline and give his erstwhile career a much needed boost. By chance, it turns out his young, female plant- lady (i.e. she waters his plants) has a way with words and because she's also Drew Barrymore they form an offbeat partnership, get involved and along the way solve Barrymore's own issues which revolve around an old teacher of hers who's used her experiences as the thinly disguised subject of a hit, soon-to-be-filmed best seller of his.The film starts off very funnily with a spot-on mickey-take of the relentlessly upbeat 80's videos from those boys from Wham, before the main story takes over and I suppose falters from there. Grant is a bit less gauche and narcissistic than usual (strangely so, given his character's C.V. here) and Barrymore is more clever than cute when her character might have played better if those traits were reversed.There's not a great deal of romantic spark between them although cosmetically they spark a little better off each other. Sadly, the supporting characters are thin while story goes through the predictable series of will they, won't they get together ups and downs before the expected happy-ending sees the succeed together on a personal and commercial level.The best lines are still those which spoof the 80's music scene, in my opinion, the decade that fashion and talent forgot, the rest of it is, unsurprisingly, soft and warm and fuzzy, rather like a typical George Michael single of the time. The big conclusion, at a massive concert thrown by new hipster Cora, sees Grant, heretofore an inept lyricist, but who throughout must of the film, keeps up a mostly witty and confident dialogue and writes a fluent open-letter lyric to Barrymore just as she's quitting the big showcase concert of Cora's where he appears to be taking sole credit for their new song for Cora.Like 80's music in general, this reasonably pleasant and amusing film doesn't exactly challenge the senses but passes the time amiably enough.",5,1,2,4 May 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman on a Wire
","Part backstage drama and part study of an actor having a nervous breakdown, (plus that awful alternative title in parentheses) you might be tempted to give this particular film a miss. Incredibly, there actually are super-hero sequences too in a movie which swings between imagination and reality, fantasy and the mundane at will, taking the viewer along with it in its wake. This latter is accomplished by the acting skills of the cast and in particular the free flowing directorial style with continuous camera work tracking the action wherever it goes, imperceptibly speeding up timelines and giving a fly-on-the-wall insight into the tawdry lives of a group of actors trying to break a play on Broadway.Central to it all is Michael Keaton, cunningly cast as an ex-movie star typecast from blockbuster movies he starred in twenty five years before as the super-hero Birdman, now trying to establish himself as a serious actor by adapting a Ray Carver short story into a play. Actually, said play looks absolutely awful but putting that to one side it's all about the characters' interaction, including his smart-aleck daughter who Keaton employs as his gopher, a maverick big-name big-headed actor who he recruits to boost the play's prospects, his plate-spinning manager desperate for the show to succeed as well as his former super-powered alter ego who makes Harvey-like appearances and utterances urging him to jettison the present.I liked the way off-beat humour kept puncturing the so-serious conversation pieces which elsewhere take up so much of the screen time, such as both Keaton and Edward Norton as superstar thespian Mike Shiner at different times caught in scenes unashamedly donning only their tighty-whiteys, Norton's character becoming aroused in a live bedroom scene and Keaton's final breakdown when he regresses completely into his super hero guise.The long-takes and relentlessly mobile camera work is wonderfully inventive and even though there is a sense that there's not really much of a story to tell here and occasionally style overtakes content. Keaton as Riggen Thompson plays the falling apart lead trying to pull himself and his play together. He demonstrates considerable range but like most of the parts here it is flashily written and screaming out for official recognition, which it duly got at the Oscars and more.I enjoyed the film and loved the depiction of New York's Broadway, especially as I've just returned from a first time visit to that very part of the Big Apple. I still have my suspicions as to whether the film will age well and really stands up in terms of content but no doubt actors and directors, budding and established will get a real kick out of it. Not being either, maybe I thought I occasionally saw instead the wires, smoke and mirrors propping it up.",7,0,0,22 February 2018
The Water Diviner," Joshua fit the battle
","Russell Crowe's directorial debut shows that he has skill behind as well as in front of the camera but ultimately, even bearing the legend 'inspired by true events', in the end this well-meaning film ran away from itself as the unexpected, coincidental and just plain ridiculous piled up the longer it went on.The first scenes of Crowe himself show him divining water in the Australian outback which somehow qualifies him to later pick out the long buried remains of two of his three soldier sons at the infamous Gallipoli battlefield. Miraculously, although shot too in battle shoulder to shoulder with his brothers, the third son survives, although not before witnessing his siblings' excruciating deaths and also not without an overwhelming sense of guilt not just because his brothers have put themselves in harm's way by trying to rescue him in the first place but because of the drastic step he has to take to take to ease the pain of one of them.Crowe also loses his wife firstly to insanity no doubt brought on by the grief over her loss and then to suicide when she finally can't go on. With nothing left to live for, Crowe embarks on his unlikely mission to bring his sons's remains back home to bury alongside their mother, stubbornly defying officialdom as personified by the officer class he encounters in the Australian, British and even the Turkish armies. He also hooks up with a young, pretty, Turkish war widow-hotelier, at her hotel, where he stays, she herself being coerced into an undesired arranged marriage with her late husband's brother. Her young son tricks Crowe into staying at their hotel and it's not too long before he strikes up a friendship with the mischievous youngster.I liked must of the early scenes, in particular the moving one where Crowe's wandered wife implores him to read from the Arabian Nights to the obviously empty beds of their children. However the narrative starts to lose credibility when he defends the young widow's honour, hooks up with a couple of Turkish vets on the run from their territorial rivals the Greeks and accomplishes a series of death-defying escapes as he homes in on his surviving son.Beautifully shot and well acted as it is, like I said the only things more clichÃ©d than the action sequences at the end were some excerpts from the dialogue too. Crowe knows where to put the camera to tell his story and is well supported by a convincing cast too. However in the final round-up, I just couldn't buy into the would-be happy endings which while they may be the long-suffering Crowe's just reward, in the end seemed too sentimental as well as unbelievable to, forgive the pun, hold water.All it needed to make this film work better was a more grounded narrative as it winged its way to an upbeat conclusion. Crowe's attempt at an outback epic in the end though well intended and made fell short at the writing stage.",5,1,3,2 January 2016
Wonder Woman," Stevie's Wonder
","Well, this DC comicdom blockbuster wasn't what I expected at all. Although I am a DC fan, I'd never read the Wonder Woman comics themselves although she was a member of the Justice League Of America comics which I did read avidly as a boy.There was an entertaining introductory prologue where we see the young Amazon Princess Diana learning her skills as well as gaining the independence she needs to later strike out on her own as she joins forces on the front line of World War One with Steve Rogers, an American soldier working undercover for British Intelligence, whose path initially crosses with hers when he accidentally leads the pursuing Germans to Paradise Island while escaping with top secret information vital to the war effort.I thought the idea of transposing the action to 1918 a clever and effective one as it reduces the need for over-the-top 'God On God' SFX pyrotechnics and in a neat twist, centred the action on the day before Armistice Day, making Diana's Mission all the more important and urgent.Of course, being a super heroine, Wonder Woman, of necessity, requires a super-villain to push against, and after being sidetracked by another competing red herring, a suitably all- powerful foe in the person of fellow God Ares, played by David Thewlis, emerges in time for a climactic battle at the end. Thewlis however is better in his part before he reveals himself and has to be kitted out in his Greek toga to provide a seemingly unlikely foil against our girl.Gal Gadot, highly praised in the title part, is indeed excellent in her role, whether playing the day-saving heroine or the innocent abroad character trying to settle into wartime London. Athletic and attractive she holds the movie together well. Chris Pine supports her ably as the down-to-earth hero Rogers.I did feel the kitchen-sink climax between Wonder Woman and Ares undid a lot of the good work that had gone before as it too garishly contrasted with the WW1 realism striven for elsewhere.One of DC's better recent movie entries, the story did however seem to write itself into a number of dead ends by the end from which it will be interesting to see how the writers move things on. However, in the comic universe, as we've seen many times before, all things are possible and I look forward to seeing this character return in future adventures.",8,3,4,8 December 2017
Paths of Glory," Devastating anti-war polemic from Kubrick
","My dad raves about this film and he's rarely wrong in his opinion about movies so I finally settled down to watch this taped-at-Christmas movie after putting it off as a deferred anticipated pleasure for long enough.It's self-evident that in the world in which we live, war films will always be topical and it can be difficult for film-makers to get across the requisite pacifist message with originality in an overcrowded field. Indeed I'm no great lover of war films per se, bludgeoned too much about the head I guess by the likes of John Wayne, Audie Murphy and others of that ilk over-simplifying and grossly simplifying the very complex human emotions which drive or in some cases hinder the ranks of ordinary men (and although not in this film, women) called up to fight for their country in the prime of their lives.Kubrick chooses to focus in on a seemingly minor uprising in the French army on the German Front in the First World War, which no doubt then, as now, would get buried away in the 'Classified' files in case its exposure damaged troop morale but goes far deeper in analysing the actions of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances with not all displaying what Hemingway termed grace under pressure. This is actually as it should be and draws the viewer's empathy as we see that all life truly is here in the fictional drama. As for the ivory-tower generals who unfeelingly treat their exhausted and dispirited underlings like sacrificial pawns to the slaughter, Kubrick delivers to them his greatest opprobrium, highlighting their self-serving, manipulative and downright callous traits, always passing the buck away from their desk.From several scenes which etch themselves deep in the memory, I'll highlight two for brevity's sake - firstly where Kubrick completes the lengthy and engrossing if dispiriting court-martial scene by cutting away from its expected climax by moving straight onto a scene with the now-condemned men already awaiting their execution - completely excising the delivering of a clichéd verdict scene, so much of a foregone conclusion is it in the 'kangaroo court' against which Kirk Douglas' character rages in vain. Kubrick then rounds off the film with the deeply moving extended scene where you fear for the safety of a captured pretty young German girl, made to sing for her supper and who knows what afterwards you fear, by a clamouring crowd of no doubt sex-starved troops, who with Douglas waiting outside to intercede, collectively draw back from the brink of primitivism as they one by one realise that this girl could be their daughter, sister or wife, as helplessly caught up in the madness of war as they are.The acting from top to bottom is terrific, Douglas brilliant in a non-action role, wholly immersed in his character's moral dilemma with George McReady and especially Adolphe Menjou, heretofore considered by me as a lightweight comedic actor, ably displaying the venality and shiftiness of the powers that be. The rest of the acting by Kubrick's ensemble as the battle-weary soldiers is also superb. The black and white cinematography hits home too in its convincing depiction of life in the trenches.This is a great film conveying the universal anti-war message with rare subtlety and conviction.",8,0,1,17 February 2010
Despicable Me," Despicably good
","Yet another charming and funny animation based on comic-book-type super-villainy as Mr Bad Guy Groo gets side-tracked in his grand plan to steal the moon by the initially unwelcome intrusion into his life by three little orphan girls with a combined cute factor of about a bazillion. That last detail alone signposts in advance that sentimentality is going to play a major part in the story and sure enough it all ends happily if of course tearfully ever after.Along the way, we get some terrific animation, the 3D version I watched being particularly impressive, with lots of inventive set-ups, none better than a roller-coaster ride simulation as well as Groo's final spaceship-to-spaceship rescue of his three charges at the end.The essential aspect of humour doesn't fail either, the three distinct personalities of the orphans (one matronly, one pesky and one cute) offering plenty of scope for laughs, as do Groo's heart-of-stone mother (improbably voiced by Julie Andrews), his nerdy super-villain rival Vector, not forgetting Groo's mute but otherwise multi-faceted lemming-like bots. Less successful though, I thought was the characterisation of Groo's crime partner inventor Dr Nephario, although this may have a lot to do with my ingrained aversion to the non-talent that is Russell Brand.I also found the soundtrack by Pharrell Williams (who he?) very Michael Jackson-lite, no doubt Justin Beiber's brand of baby-pop will feature in the sequel. No, I'll remember better the genuinely funny moments inserted just for us adults like Groo's bots rallying round with their worldly possessions to fund his master-plan to steal the moon, very 'It's A Wonderful Life' where buffs will surely remember James Stewart also trying to lasso the moon for wife Donna Reed, likewise the nameplate for the Bank of Evil (which funds criminal plots), which bears the legend 'formerly Lehman Brothers'.In the end though, all you can do is chalk up another plus to the animator whizz-kids who demonstrate yet again their ability to create another hugely entertaining, funny, occasionally witty and yes, family-friendly entertainment.",7,0,0,21 July 2012
Taken 2," Miss taken
","Rather inevitable follow-up to 'Taken' the movie that made Liam Neeson an unlikely action hero, like an older Jason Bourne, by which I men a bunch of bad men come after Liam's family, this time and mother makes three and live, or should that be die to regret it. There is a change of location to Istanbul which means we get some nice establishing shots of the city and one action chase across the rooftops to afford some nice views of the skyline.Otherwise, Liam is up to his usual tricks of being able to avoid bullets at will, kill a man by just laying his hand on his face, guide his daughter go the baddies lair by having her through grenades all over the city and best of all recreate the route back to the villains himself with a combination of super hearing and total recall which wouldn't embarrass a cross between Superman and Sherlock Holmes.Oh and there's lots of shooting, killing, fist fights and car chases, the silliest of which being when Liam's daughter tears across town driving like an Indy 500 veteran with her dad in the passenger seat, trying to avoid the pursuing would-be killers and achieving a death- defying race across a railway line which the other car doesn't...before she's even passed her driving-test.It's all unbelievable nonsense, directed at a furious pace with cross-cuts and multiple shots of the same scene, to a pounding musical backdrop just to further reinforce the feeling that you're actually in the middle of a shoot-em-up-cum-car-chase computer game.Neeson does his best latter-day John Wayne, but the incompetence of the baddies, plus they seem to have a far-from-threatening family ringleader means that the ending is never in doubt. In fact I'd go as far to say the beginning and middle were never in doubt either, if you've seen 'Taken 1'.Pretty predictable, passionless stuff all round I'd say.",4,1,2,28 June 2015
The Woman in Black," Hammer House of Horror
","Years ago I saw the long-running play of this film but so long ago as to forget almost everything but the scary face of the Woman herself, so it was great to sit in late of a night and let Hammer films scare me once again with a traditional haunted house tale.Shot in a washed-out, almost monotone kind of colour - scheme, this was a well-paced and beautifully filmed movie, in particular the house interiors and the spectacular views of the desolate, tide-covered road leading up to it. Daniel Radcliffe returns to the supernatural to play a recently widowed young solicitor tasked with investigating the papers attendant on a recent death at said house, only this time he has no magic powers to assist him. In truth he's way too young for the part, especially with a five-year-old looking son in tow, but he otherwise cuts an effectively gaunt figure facing up to the enmity of the village for disturbing the old ghost, who every time she's seen prefigures the death of a young child. As is the norm in films of this type, despite experiencing some very strange goings on at his first visit to the house, he nonetheless decides to not only return but to stay over alone (bar an accompanying dog) when he could just as easily have had all the relevant papers transported to the inn where he's staying.Suspense is built up nicely for the fright-scenes with subjective camera shots, flash cuts and an atmospheric music score. There's worthy support for Radcliffe especially from Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer as the wealthy couple also struck down by the curse. It all comes to the boil with an unexpectedly callous but in the end appropriate climax, as you realise that Radcliffe and his son could never be happy as they were anyway.In short, a rattling good ghost story, just like Hammer used to make.",7,1,3,12 September 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Rise and fall
","Hate to go against the consensus but I wasn't blown away by the conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. I admit I have something of an issue of identification with certain of the characters as I stopped reading the source comics before Bane came along. That said, in the trademark blockbuster, 'meet the villain' opening scene, he makes a huge impression, spectacularly plane-jacking a scientist for his own ends.I just felt the plot was too fit-to-burst busy, cramming in major parts for Catwoman, Commissioner Gordon, who inexplicably comes on like a pensioner version of John McClain, Alfred (continuing the serious miscasting of Michael Caine, who really hams it up here), John Blake, the fearless young cop who we presume becomes Robin in this alternative universe and finally Miranda Tate who also morphs into a major enemy for Batman. No wonder the film runs an overlong two and a half hours. Speaking of whom, the titular hero himself doesn't appear himself until some 45 minutes in and probably gets less time in costume than all the other characters mentioned above. The convolutions of the plot, especially as it strains to complete the narrative circle of the trilogy, were a bit too much for me and while there were spectacular scenes like Bane's demolition of Gotham, the police pursuit of Batman on his new bendy-bike and his last gasp hauling away of the atom bomb, none of them really felt integral to the plot and just seemed how they looked, that is, bravura directorial set pieces. As for the conclusion or should that be conclusions as the film has several of them, the final fight between Batman and Bane just doesn't grip as it should (c.f. Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort to see how it should be done), with the big guy going down way too easily, Talia also expires with a whimper and the final bomb rescue belonged more in a Superman film. Regarding the new characters, Anne Hathaway made for a surprisingly sexy Catwoman although where she picked up her self-defence skills I don't know, Bane as I said flattered to deceive and Talia was here and gone in seconds. On the whole though, I struggled to get through this long movie and didn't really recognise 'my' Batman in it. I look forward to the next reincarnation of one of my favourite comic book heroes but fear he's been backed into a corner by director Nolan's over-earnest approach. I hope he comes out the other end a little less tortured and battered and with a bit more lightness and action about him.",5,4,10,3 February 2013
Iron Man," Iron out the rough spots...
","Actually, I feel quite well qualified to rate this movie as, being a big comic-book fan (although more DC than Marvel!), I'd digested Marvel's 'Essential Iron Man' re-print of all the early Stan Lee penned Iron Man comics just before this film appeared. Given my belief that, with few exceptions, movie-goers (at least mature ones like me, I suspect) prefer less crash-bang action in their super-hero flicks and more characterisation and plot, (which you invariably tend to get in origin-type stories), this film is all the better for being of that ilk.It has plenty of faults too though, which I'll get off my chest post-haste. Firstly, whilst respecting that the original Iron Man comic creation was born at the time of the Cold War and doesn't shy away from painting Iron Man's enemies as often originating from Red China or Soviet Russia, while this is okay in comicdom, I was uneasy at setting what is basically a super-hero confection in war-torn Afghanistan, especially at this particular time with the conflict far from over and US & UK casualties rising.Secondly, Iron Man isn't the most original of heroes, borrowing the playboy image of Batman's Bruce Wayne and the humanitarian angst of Spider Man's Peter Parker. Also, the movie gets off to a fairly unpleasant start, with an unnecessary rock soundtrack in tow, with a gratuitous celebration of mega-rich Stark's opulent lifestyle, where women are just 'what's your name again' objects of desire or easy conquest, as even a hard-nosed but attractive journalist falls too easily for Stark's dubious charms.Thirdly, there's Gwynneth Paltrow who non-acts her way throughout as Stark's 'Miss Moneypenny', Pepper Potts, who in the comics blossoms from prim & proper secretary to a dazzling beauty, which certainly doesn't happen here. And yes I could have done without the sub-Transformers action climax between Iron Man Marks 1 & 2, but I guess you have to give the teens something to watch at the finish. Strange also to see Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan restricted to almost 'extra' status - in the comics he's every bit as important to Stark as Pepper and indeed is jealous of her feelings for Stark. Ironically this part is, I see, played by director Favreau himself! And yes, while it's de rigeur for blockbusters like this, the in your face product placement does grate (Audi & McDonald's prominent amongst them).On the plus side though, there's Robert Downey, cool as anything in the lead role. Thankfully he rarely dons the Iron Man armour so he gets to act a lot, definitely a plus. Ditto an almost unrecognisable, let's be generous, somewhat filled out Jeff Bridges as Stark's double-dealing mentor Obadiah Stane. The dialogue is invariably snappy and quick-fire, with occasional stabs of humour permeating through. I do feel though the director missed out on a possibly humorous King King moment as Stane, by now having his Doctor Octopus moment in donning the recreated prototype Iron Man armour, menaces Paltrow's Potts. The closing revelation by Stark as to his alter ego is also up there with Indiana Jones shooting of the 'whipmaster' in the surprise stakes, certainly I don't recall Stark revealing his identity in the comics.Best of all though is the armour, which films great in burnished red and gold. Downey's extended scenes where he attempts to master his equipment are probably the best in the film and the special effects in general are at the top-end of the scale.So there you have it, another successful addition to Hollywood's roster of comicdom and no doubt a relief to Mavel after the comparative failure of big name dramatisations like Daredevil, The Hulk (twice) and the Fantastic Four.",6,2,4,24 July 2009
Blade Runner," Future imperfect
","I can easily see why this film has become the cult movie it is today, regularly championed as one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Considering it was made almost thirty years ago, it's still visually stunning with its neo-noir gloomy cinematography, the exterior shots made darker still with seemingly constant heavy rain mixed with an imaginative future vision taking in flying cars and outsize, almost floating video-advertisements, the latter at once familiar in its common-placedness and yet disturbing in its exaggeration and omnipresence.There really isn't that much of a story with Ford basically re-hired by the police force he previously left to track down four humanistic androids (called replicants) escaped to earth from a space colony and now determined to revenge themselves on their creator. Besides some interaction between Ford and the replicant creator's is-she-or-isn't-she P.A., the film moves inevitably towards a final confrontation between Ford's Deckard's character and the replicant leader, the sadistic, revengeful Rutger Houer.For me though, the film loves its own look a little too much and is ponderous to watch at times, interspersed by scenes of random but brutal violence. We fleetingly come across minor human characters who seem to have regressed from society none more so than JF Sebastian who becomes their link to ultimate target megalomaniac Tyrell, who lives in cluttered squalor alone with his homemade mechanical toys and robots.In fact I'll take cluttered squalor as pretty much my description of the whole movie. Inevitably it devolves to a showdown between a rampaging, but fast expiring Hauer and an exhausted, beaten-up Ford which doesn't play out as you'd expect and an enigmatic final scene which interestingly questions whether Deckard's mightn't be a replicant himself.'Blade Runner' certainly succeeds in serving up a bleak vision of the future reminiscent of Fritz Lang's epochal 'Metropolis' decades earlier. At times nightmarish in its sheer banality, it can be seen to have inspired future generations of directors and writers in film and print. Personally, it still seems to me like a short story elongated to movie length but there's no denying its imagination and artistic vision, even if I might have preferred a bit more pace and action along the way to lighten the darkness a little.",6,1,6,3 December 2014
The Greatest Showman," Roll up, roll up...
","It's funny but about this time last year my wife and I watched 'La La Land', the acclaimed, multi Oscar winning feature which was proclaimed as the great throwback celebration of the Hollywood musical and we were sorely disappointed. This latest movie features a soundtrack by the same songwriting team and of course is likewise a popular hit, both at the box office and the music charts but still we were trepidatious to watch it, but happily this time we got it.Maybe it helped that the characters in this film were easier to like and relate to or maybe it's just that the staging, acting, singing and just the songs themselves were better but whatever the reasons this really was everything we'd expected. Both the title and the story hark back to 50's blockbuster 'The Greatest Show On Earth' but even if there's occasionally a bit of a culture clash as modern musical stylings rub up sometimes a little incongruously against mid 19th Century Americana, the sheer energy of the piece carries it through.The rise and fall and rise again story of barnstorming circus entrepreneur P.T. Barnum is naturally exciting, evocative and exotic with the viewer rooting for him and his band of underdog misfits all the way. The songs are terrific, the uptempo ones rhythmic and engaging, the power ballads moving and involving. The choreography and cinematography make excellent use of the circus backdrop, while the cast sell it for all its worth, especially the dashing and energetic Hugh Jackman in the title role.In summary then, a wonderful old / new-fashioned musical family entertainment which will have you singing along and tapping your toes to from first to last.",7,3,7,13 February 2018
Casino Royale," Meet the new Bond...
","007 out of 10 that is! An obviously big budget feature, attempting to take its place in the lineage of one of cinema's longest running franchises as well as show a thing or two to contenders-not-pretenders such as Matt Damon's Jason Bourne series. And while it succeeds in the former, it doesn't for me cohere well enough to outstrip the latter. Dealing with the history first, there are some nice reference points such as the exotic locations, (here prominently taking in author Fleming's old hunting ground, the Bahamas), the introduction to Felix Leiter of the CIA and of course the beautiful 'Bond-Girl' women, although the sex scenes seem toned down, perhaps for the censor perhaps just a statement of intent to eschew frippery. The in-jokes are cute and worth watching for; the fact that the famous Bond tuxedo is picked for him by a woman, the nonchalance displayed over Bond's trademark, 'shaken, not stirred' Martini, the Aston Martin and the ending on the famous 'Bond, James Bond' announcement. It was also good to see Bond up against an everyday sadistic, high-rolling villain rather than a 'rule the world' Blofeld type - certainly realism is in, cartoonery out - there are only a couple of humorous quips here to echo the early Connery's delivery (until the gadgets took over)...and yet the whole doesn't quite catch in my view. For example compare the lengthy running chase early on between Bond and his assassin protagonist to the similar scene in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and there's really no comparison in terms of action, stunt-invention and thrill-making - Bourne wins hands down. Also making an over-lengthy poker game the fulcrum of the action (am I the only person who has no interest in this over-rated past-time/sport - the new 'rock and roll' my eye!) slows the action down far too much. What action there is, and there are healthy doses, is fine, some of the effects excellent, particularly the climax to the earlier referred-to chase, high up on construction cranes and the demolition of a Venetian warehouse at the climax but I also found the acting suspect. It was also strange to view a prequel to a 1962 movie with completely up to date gadgetry, talk about lack of continuity. Daniel Craig is more craggy than handsome as Bond, but again this is going the right way, in my view, taking us back to the machismo Connery prototype. He's fine in the terseness stakes but lapses into Lazenby territory when required to get emotional over the death of Vesper for example. Mads Mikkelson as Chiffre does a reasonable sub-Christopher Walken turn but doesn't quite seem vicious enough - indeed his guerrilla paymasters are far more violent in his pursuit. All told though, now that introductions and exposition are out of the way, let's hope that the next instalment ups the ante just as 'From Russia With Love' did when succeeding 'Dr No' all those years ago.",7,0,7,30 March 2008
Toy Story 3," The story continues
","I watched 'Toy Story 3' not long after the very disappointing, played out 'Shrek 4' (sound like a football score) so my hopes weren't high and indeed, half an hour in thought that I was in for a marshmallowy cloying tale with no thrills drama or edge to it. I should have known better of course and even if said thrills drama and edge not unnaturally lacked something in terms of originality, still a satisfying conclusion was delivered with plenty of fun along the way.Pixar has totally taken ownership of the Disney mantle of purveying animated features that appeal on a basic level to children and the child in adults, intuitively tapping into the latter's fading memories of our own childhoods, never more so in the opening scenes where the toys play out a fully-realised fantasy adventure in the mind of the child in the movie and by extension, the child in us before reality intrudes.The rest is pretty formulaic with the customary themes of nostalgia, family ties and loyalty reworked, taking in neat comic vignettes on the whole Ken and Barbie relationship, just how destructive and anarchic a children's play-group can actually be and a homage to Latin lovers everywhere when Buzz's controls are reset to (Spanish) factory settings. As ever there are more than enough knowing lines inserted for grown-up consumption, my favourite hidden-away gem being John Ratzenberger's Cliff from 'Cheers' retort of 'negatory', but there are a fair sprinkling of other comedic nuggets, while the sequence of Ken modelling his entire wardrobe is surely destined for classic status.Of course, the movie assumes a universality of remembrance for an American child's infant years which can never resonate wholly with everyone, but nevertheless 'Toy Story 3' maintains the high standard of its predecessors with its winning combination of great animation, subtle characterisation, action adventure and that magic ingredient of childhood evocation to which we can surely all relate.Can't see where a further sequel can arise however from the dead-end into which the writers have painted themselves, but I guess I thought that about James bond and Star. Trek too...",7,0,3,30 December 2010
Bull Durham," Base balderdash
","Probably helps a lot, watching this film, if you're American and of course, a baseball lover, neither of which I am, so maybe I'm a bit out of line marking down this sometimes entertaining sports/sex-farce. That said, being British and a lover of cricket, I think I'm safe in saying it will be a long time before Hollywood makes a cricket movie, let alone a cricket / sex farce! I wasn't even aware there were such things as 'baseball-groupies' or 'Annie's' as I believe they're called but as ball-game slappers go, it has to be said that Susan Sarandon's Annie Savoy and her young sidekick Millie, certainly offer an understandable come-hither attraction to the dumb grunts who make up the baseball team's ranks.The acting by the A-list cast is very good, Sarandon in particular scoring (no pun intended) as the inexhaustible, Durham Bulls fan with a novel way to bring on young talent in the team, well supported by a a very young looking Tim Robbins as her number one draft pick this particular year and Kevin Costner as the seen-it-all-before old lag who arrives to encourage Robbins' character in more traditional manner but who likewise falls for Annie's charms and ends up competing with his protégé for the squiring rights.Like I said, a lot of the baseball terminology and action pretty much passed me by, although I did enjoy Costner's universal roll-call of sporting clichés to Robbins for his first major television interview. The sex-scenes are perhaps a bit seamier and steamier than I would have anticipated, but probably acceptable enough given the battle of the sexes going on here. One thing I couldn't get over though was the interjection throughout of 50's imagery for what reason I couldn't gather, for instance, Sarandon in her first scenes is wearing 50's style attire and vintage rock and roll songs crop up regularly throughout the soundtrack.On the whole I was reasonably engaged by the characters and the humour of their interaction before they all got the endings they each wanted. Not quite a home run for me then, but I wouldn't have taken a walk and avoided the film if it had been offered to me (I think that's a baseball term!).",5,4,9,10 February 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," American girls are easy
","I liked one third of this recent Woody Allen film, the Barcelona part. I've visited the city two or three times and shot in golden light, it's beautifully brought to the screen in all its Gaudi and Miro-Inflected glory.Unfortunately his actors keep getting in the way of the scenery and worse they're talking the most pretentious nonsense and acting out the most ridiculous story you could imagine. It all starts in a Barcelona bar when two rich and supposedly intellectual adventure- seeking American tourists catch the eye of a swarthy Spaniard who immediately abandons the company he's keeping to proposition the pair of them by inviting them to join him on a private plane ride to Ovieda where he confidently asserts he will sleep with them both. Well girls, the Spanish word for 'Police!' is 'Policia', which is of course what anyone else would shout under the circumstances, but in Woody's world this is plot development so naturally they go with it and of course it duly happens. Did I mention that Javier Bardem as said Spaniard is a temperamental artist with a complicated love-life and that Scarlett Johannsen as the free spirit of the two girls is a short-film director-cum-photographer and that Rebecca Moore as the passive, vulnerable one has a degree in Catalan? So everyday, as ever in Allen's films. All the time he's with them, Bardem talks about about the stormy relationship he had with his ex-wife which is when you realise that Penelope Cruz must turn up soon and sure enough, she does, having failed in an overdose attempt and now keen to start a ménage-a-trois with Barden and Johannsen. Okay, I can't write this anymore, my memory's hurting at the remembrance of it. This is an absolutely awful movie from a so-called master-director who has lost all sense of timing, finesse and skill. He even employs a narrator (again), an actor with a voice uncannily similar to his own younger-self to move the story along or tell us how his characters think, which in retrospect is helpful as the viewers need all the help they can get to follow the convolutions of the story here. If Woody wants to regale us for the umpteenth time about the relationship between the sexes, with a little twist contrasting western reserve and Latin passion, he has to do it with a better written, played and directed piece than this. It's an absolute mess, trite, contrived and about as far removed from reality as I am from the moon. Oh and that little flamenco 'Barcelona' number will drive you crazy too, by the end.",1,9,17,14 March 2012
Son of Saul," Hell on earth
","I found this film almost as difficult to review as I did to watch. Surely no-one could imagine the horrors of trying to survive Auschwitz on a minute by minute never mind hourly or daily basis but this film puts you almost literally behind the eyes of one man in the camp as the camera only rarely changes perspective from his subjective viewpoint to a more objective position so that you effectively only see what he sees and experience what he experiences. Immediately you sense the dehumanization of the individual as he and his specially chosen fit and able fellow POW's perform the task of removing, burning and disposing of the remains of the hundreds of daily gas victims there. When he sees a young boy somehow survive the gassing only to be even more cruelly murdered by suffocation by the German doctor on the scene, he impulsively decides to appropriate the boy's corpse and have it consecrated by a rabbi.Along the way he gets involved in a mass escape attempt by his fellow inmates but even then carries the boy's body with him as he moves.As I said, the movie was excruciating to watch at times. Think of all the famous (or infamous) cultural or artistic depictions of hell by the likes of Dante, Hyronemus Bosch, Picasso, Goya and others and you're only part way there. The cacophonous background sounds, abrupt switching of perspectives and sometimes distorted speaking voices all combine to batter away at the viewer's senses so that on a sensory level, the movie succeeds if too well.As others have said however, when you learn that the story itself is fictionalised, when there were thousands of separate stories which could have been told, for me weakened the whole premise. I suppose we must be grateful that there is almost no real footage of the atrocities the Nazis committed in these labour camps and it's beyond argument, especially with the worrying rise these days of Holocaust deniers, that the producers and director of this searing movie, that it shouldn't be depicted as harshly and realistically as here.However, from a personal point of view, the combination of the relentless visual and audio attack on my senses together with that nagging doubt about the contrived nature of the main narrative in the end proved unsatisfactory to me. This subject is so vast and open to personal artistic interpretation that for some this hellish visualisation of events might be the best way to put across such an important message but as a movie viewer, I personally found it brutalising, numbing and much as I hate to say it repellent.",4,2,3,2 August 2018
Flight," Up and down
","I'll try to avoid aviation clichés in this review but it will be tough. Denzel Washington was rightly Oscar-nominated for his leading role (indeed, he's almost never off the screen) as a troubled airline pilot with a broken-down marriage and pretty much broken-down life with an addiction to drugs, alcohol and sex as the first five minutes alone make clear. Still hungover on drink and drugs he pulls off a miraculous flight manoeuvre to save dozens of lives (although not all of them) when the plane he's flying almost literally falls apart on him in stormy weather. Despite his heroics, his physical state in the cockpit becomes obvious to incident investigators who then seek to try him for dereliction of duty whereupon he escapes to a remote bolt-hole, bumping into drug addict Kelly Carey with whom he strikes up a tempestuous relationship which takes them both further down until reality bites giving them both a shot at redemption.For me, the film peters out after the dramatic scene-setting plane crash, itself a wonder of special effects. I didn't buy into his relationship with poor-white-trash Carey and felt his own struggles with his demons were overplayed. That and his character's name being 'Whip' Whitmore! Sentimentality is thankfully shunted pretty much out of the way but there's nothing edifying in seeing Washington's character go to the dogs. He's not very likable from the start and by the time he reaches his epiphany in the courtroom, it's too late to start caring anyway.This is more serious stuff than I'm used to seeing from 'Back To The Future' director Zemecks and he does reasonably well with it. Besides the crash scene, there are other memorable scenes including one in the opening minutes when Washington comes dramatically to life after snorting cocaine. In the end though the movie tails off into melodrama and never regains altitude thereafter, the use of which clichés tells me to wrap up this review before I introduce a squadron's worth.",6,2,4,13 January 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Wizard ending
","Knowing in advance both how the story goes (and with J K Rowling on board as a co- producer, that it wasn't going to be changed much) and naturally how it ends, it was incumbent on Peter Yates to nonetheless deliver the big finish to Harry's adventures and in particular his final showdown with Voldemort. I wasn't disappointed and in the end had only minor quibbles about the resolution.The dark atmosphere from Part 1 is continued with the action mostly played out in scenes of brooding darkness and to the background of weighty soundtrack music. There is noticeably less of Hermione and Ron, which is only right given the necessary one-on-one fight with Voldemort at the conclusion. While that duel, with shades of Holmes and Moriarty, was always going to be the climax here, I enjoyed the build-up to it, with the escape from Gringotts, Snape's revelatory Pensieve memories, Harry's supernatural interviews with Rowena Ravenclaw (and Dumbledore), plus of course the blowing-up of Hogwarts all contributing to the excitement and anticipation.Rowling herself has stated that from the first, she had a clear vision of Harry and Voldemort's final reckoning with both of them circling each other in a blasted landscape and this was exactly what was delivered. I did however feel confused if not cheated as to how the Elder wand reverted to Harry, when all along Voldemort had made such a strong claim for it, but still the Evil Lord's demise was spectacularly satisfying when it came.My only other carps were the pointless inclusion of the 19-years-on epilogue, which added nothing and detracted from the high point achieved with the death of Voldemort (I know it's in the book, but it told us nothing important - as if we didn't know they were all going to live happily ever), the abbreviated round-up afforded different characters from previous episodes, especially Hagrid, the Weasley parents and Jim Broadbent's character, plus it can't be denied that the three main characters by now seem too a little old for their parts (although it's not their fault that the time needed to create such large-scale movies by- passed their characters' natural time-lines) and my old caveat that too many of the supporting parts were played by too-familiar faces from British acting royalty (it's a wonder Judi Dench didn't get a look in).But in the whole this was fantastic entertainment and a worthy finish to the saga, which I hope they don't spoil by rebooting sometime in the future.",8,1,2,28 December 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Hungry for more
","As I only watched the original 'Hunger Games' as part of a child-minding mission for my now 12 year-old niece, it figured that the only way I was going to willingly watch the sequel was when co-opted to 'baby-sit' for her again. Hey, it's quite a long film so it keeps young Erin occupied for a crucial 2 and a half hours, but whisper it, like before, it's quite an enjoyable film.I don't know if its army of teenage followers completely get the allusions to the perils of totalitarianism, manipulation of media and the corruption of power, but Erin sort of did which has to be a good thing. Like many, I wondered how they could get Catniss and Peeta back into the arena after the conclusion to the last film, but this was skilfully done. Their disillusion with their new-found celebrity and its corruption by the powers that be naturally lead our feisty duo to rebellion and while there is the expected lengthy action inset where they bloodily battle royal with the previous champions, there's a good twist at the end setting up the next chapter which I'm sure won't be long in arriving.Yet again, the young actors in the lead roles acquit themselves very well indeed, particularly Jennifer Lawrence as Catniss. Athletic as she is, she is equally well capable of displaying the wide range of emotions her part requires of her. The senior support at her back add gravity and credibility to proceedings, the veteran (if that's the right word) triumvirate of the menacing Donald Sutherland, scheming (late) Philip Seymour-Hoffman and supportive Woody Harrelson all committing to their roles.Who knows, maybe I'll catch the next chapter without the excuse of my niece's presence, although on second thoughts it's better with her even to explain the complexities of the plot, character motivations and of course to anticipate particularly exciting or gory scenes before they occur.",6,1,11,16 August 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Teen time-travel trippers
","Not quite sure just why I watched this popular teen comedy-adventure film from the 80's but I was a teenager once myself and I enjoy a good time-travel yarn and with hopes of a 'Back to the Future' type entertainment thought I'd give it a shot.Okay in hindsight, I'd probably have enjoyed it more if I was actually still in or just out of school, but it was enjoyable all the same. The nods to predecessors like the afore-mentioned 'Back To The Future' (meeting themselves in time, the lightning bolt exits and entries), Dr Who (even down to using a phone-box as their time-travelling craft) and 'Quantum Leap' (with the Rufus character as their Admiral Al mentor and cajoler) are obvious and of course it plugs into the same nerdy humour which made the 'Wayne's World' movies equally successful.I enjoyed the first half hour more when the dynamic duo's catch-phrases and mannerisms were fresh but lost interest in the rest feeling that there could have been better interplay among their historical kidnapees. One or two of the jokes made me smile (Freud quizzing an interrogating cop on his feelings for his mother and Bill owning up to a mildly Oedipal complex over his sexy step-mom) and the two leads obviously have fun outgorm-ing each other.I could have done without the so-dated 80's pomp rock soundtrack, even as I felt that the movie was crying out for an Eddie Van Halen cameo appearance, but I can't judge this too harshly. Okay, so maybe 'Time Bandits' did it better, but this was pleasant lightweight inoffensive fun and a lot less vulgar than most of the teen-market aimed output from latter-day Hollywood.",5,3,6,20 November 2009
Looper," Loop the loop
","I like science-fiction and in particular plots involving time-travel but with this film was too much put off by the for me, over-complicated plot and unlike-ability of the lead character in all his incarnations.That main character, played largely by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt is a futuristic assassin who waits at an appointed place and time in the past to ruthlessly shoot down in cold blood, bound and blindfolded mob victims conveniently sent back in time to be dispatched by time-travel controlling gangsters.This routine of ritual murder was played out too many times for me to be effective and actually ended up being offensive. Moreover, Leavitt's character gives you no other reason to care for or even like him, living a hedonistic drugs and girls-fuelled life-style. Just when you think he's about to show a degree of loyalty to a hunted-down friend and colleague, he obligingly turns him in under hardly the strongest of intimidation by admittedly still imposing gang master Jeff Daniels.Things get further complicated when he encounters his future-self, played by Bruce Willis, out on a back-in-time mission to take out the infant who has later grown up to be the murderer of his wife. Said child is cooped up in a rambling wooden house Deepintheheartofnowhere,being brought up in between violent mood-swings by his tomboy, gun-toting young mom. The story lines converge around a surprising twist at the end, but not before a lot of hootin' and-a-shootin' takes place.I tried really hard to keep up with the plot but kept getting skewered by awkwardly-placed events of little apparent relevance or merit, particularly a gratuitous out-of-nowhere sex scene between Leavitt and Blunt, the possible incestuous overtones of which don't bear thinking about.Like I said earlier, none of the characters evoked any sympathy or even interest in me and I found the violence brutal and over-bearing, deadening my faculties long before the end. It's set up of course for old-hand Willis to steal the show, tooled up like it was the 80's again, but I'm not sure there was much of a show here to steal in the first place.",4,1,2,10 February 2013
Heat," Good cop bad guy / bad cop good guy?
","The attraction of this film is obvious in the star-power of its twin leads Pacino and De Niro. Having both come through the 70's and 80's with many career-defining roles with Al usually on the side of the Angels and Bob down with the Devils, this film can be seen as at least a semi-colon if not quite a full-stop to these actors playing these types of parts again. Myself I wouldn't have thought Michael Mann the director to get them in the same movie (even if they only meet up in two scenes), as my preconceptions of Mann back in the mid 90's pretty much begin and end with TV's style-over-content 'Miami Vice', meaning I was expecting over-exaggerated characters, extreme situations, improbable connections, loud background music and of course lots of gunpower and violence. Well I got them all, but somehow, overblown and unbelievable as it was, as a movie it still worked.Mann plays up the duality of these two brilliant but idiosyncratic men, Pacino's Vincent Hanna and De Niro's Neil McCauley on different sides of the law and enables us to look behind the tough-guy personae to at least glimpse their lives away from crime only to discover that these two don't have a life outside the commission of crime by one and the prevention of crime by the other.Switch leads...? I don't think so. Pacino plays the all-powerful cop in his typical shouty, showy way while De Niro depicts the cool-headed, resourceful crook in his more understated but still highly characteristic way. The main scene where they meet and establish a reluctantly conceded mutual admiration is probably the film's best, two peacocks parading their feathers in front of each other. Of the supporting cast, Val Kilmer makes a big impression as the gun-happy young Maverick in thrall to his boss De Niro and while I don't know much about the two actresses who play the main protagonists' women, both more than hold their own in their scenes with their men. Of course, with Mann you get big set pieces, superbly staged, with the centrepiece being the bank heist that goes spectacularly wrong and ends up a high-volume shoot out in the shopping mall but there's also De Niro's revenge hit on his gang's snitch and the tense final shoot-out between the big two. Mann's cinematography throughout treats L.A. as almost a character in the movie with numerous night-time city-scapes as De Niro and his new girl seek to somehow rise above what they are and escape their pasts while Pacino is frequently seen in a police helicopter zooming in and out of the city's skyscrapers as he tries to keep a lid on the rampant crime on his beat. Hand in hand with the stylish visuals goes the use of music to add further shade and drama to proceedings with a suitably dense, Gothic soundtrack which almost elevate the film to a modern day grand opera.It's arguable whether Mann, De Niro or Pacino were ever this good again with all three since then making movie choices they surely would regret in hindsight if they'd thought or cared much about their own legacies. But as late-career artistic hurrahs go, this is about as good as it gets, I'd say.",8,1,2,28 July 2017
Green Book," Driving Mr Shirley
","For my sins I had never heard of black musician Don Shirley before this film dramatisation of his purposeful 1962 tour of the southern states of America with his two accompanying white musicians. To drive him around the land of Jim Crow, Shirley hires a tough, barely literate but mob-connected Italian bouncer Tony Lip, late of New York's Copacabana Club, who is temporarily out of work when the famous night club closes for repairs and so is looking for work in the run-up to Christmas.What follows is a combination road-trip, buddy-buddy, civil rights revisionist feature which if it too often falls into cliche and sentimentalism, nonetheless delivers an upbeat, feel-good movie, as these two polar opposites, one impeccably spoken and dressed, the other guttural and slobbish unsurprisingly rub off on each other changing their perceptions of their own places in society and basically confirming the old truism that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.To be fair, I was almost counting off the stock situations Shirley would blithely walk into on the road, such as an encounter where he seems bemused at the sight of poor black sharecroppers working in the field, the inevitable injurious run-ins with racist Southern citizens in a bar, redneck Southern cops keen to put him down for being 'uppity' with them and even the in-bred bigoted attitudes at the very night-spot he's been hired to play. Luckily Big Tony is on hand every time to rescue him with a mixture of brawn and bluff so that by the end, the ice-cool Shirley's reserve and distance duly breaks down and the hot-headed Bronx-bruiser has come to admire the bravery and musicianship of his passenger.Sure some of the situations seemed contrived, like the cultured Shirley letting his hair down with an R 'n' B group at a road-side bar or the Capra-corn-type Christmas scene at the end but there were compensatory scenes elsewhere like when Tony mis-remembers the title of one of his new boss's celebrated. albums or when the erudite Shirley helps Tony to write his letters home.I very much enjoyed the acting of the two leads and the authentic settings depicted of early 60's America and even if this story based on true events (at least according to the film's introductory titles) was a little too sugar-coated, I must admit I enjoyed the ride with these two larger than life characters.",7,1,3,20 May 2019
Fantastic Four," Flame off
","As I've said before on my IMDb reviews, I am a super-heroes comics fan, although more of the DC than Marvel persuasion - there is undeniably something appealing to seeing childhood characters leap off the page in human as opposed to animated form. I know a little of the Fantastic Four, but what comes across from this movie version is that they are probably more on the super-hero-lite side of the fence (c.f. Superman, Daredevil - at least the way he was represented on-screen, The Flash, even Iron Man) as opposed to the super-hero-heavy side, where invariably the characters have deeper psychological stuff going on (Batman, Hulk and Spider Man spring to mind).This FF movie, although enough of a hit to give birth to a sequel definitely falls into the former category, probably to its detriment. Perhaps with the focus shared amongst four heroes, there's no room for penetrating analysis into any of the four's psyches; even the Thing's rejection by his wife and feelings of being a freakish outcast from society is swept aside to the extent that he even recreates his mutation despite being cured by Dr Doom's machine.So, on with the eye candy - Ioan Gruffudd is pleasant if hardly dominating as the leader of the group, ditto Jessica Alba, who if anything looks too young for her part. Chris Evans gets to give us 'yoof-full' attitude while Michalel Chikris probably does best of the four with the greater demands of the Thing's character. Julian McMahon is anodyne but rarely evil as Dr Doom (did Stan Lee give every one of his heroes a villain who was a genius scientist changed by one of their own experiments gone wrong into their evil selves - Dr Octopus, Green Goblin also fit that template).There's a smattering of sometimes earthy humour, usually from Johnny Storm's 'Human Torch' and unsurprisingly Miss Alba gets to shed her clothes to play out the age-old 'Invisible Man / Woman' clichés. The effects are mostly good, although there's some poor graphics work in an early sequence where Storm and girlfriend take to the ski-slopes from the skies.It's all directed at pace and supported by a pounding sub-teen soundtrack which wasn't to my taste but tells you the age group it was aimed at. Despite all this, the film did, for me drag at times and seems to run on too long ad like I said is the weaker for the lack of empathy with any or all of the main characters.That said, it's the way you'd normally expect a comic - book adaptation to be made, all day-glo and maximum volume. I prefer the guys from the dark side more (Batman, Spider Man) where the adaptations by Nolan and Raimi transcend the source material and reach out beyond the fascinated teenager I was too many years ago.",5,1,3,1 October 2010
Aladdin," How the genie got out the bottle...
","A great typical family-oriented Disney feature gets a lift by giving Robin Williams pretty much the run of the place as a genie with a) an attitude and b) a gift for improv. So you get all the expected heart-warming romantic stuff and exciting chases and surprising intrigues but with that soupçon of the unexpected and, deal with it, belly laughs to boot. At a stroke, it broke the mould for countless Disney / Pixar films to come which appealed as much to kids as to adults, by catering to the would-be adults in all the kids and of course the universal kids in all the adults. If I was being critical, perhaps the background-settings could have wowed me a bit more, especially with the fabulous source-material and the vocal characterisation of the evil Jafar a bit more strongly delineated bu I'm probably nit-picking. As someone whose first book was the 'Arabian Nights' at age 5, and whose only experience of the Aladdin story since has been mostly in local pantomimes down the years, it was great to see Disney's modern but traditional take on the story. The songs are good too, skilfully worded and not over-populous. Interesting to conjecture about the fact that this Hollywood production from 1992 was made at the time of the U.S. involvement in the first Gulf War plus I like the way it, if gently, challenges the notion of female roles in Arabian society, sadly still a topical subject almost 20 years on. Very funny, mildly subversive entertainment you can take your kids to - now that is a rarity in modern cinema.",8,2,3,26 December 2011
Incredibles 2," The Inedibles
","I loved the first 'The Incredibles' and remember wondering why a follow-up hadn't been made soon after its success. Better late than never you might say but personally after watching this 14-years later sequel, I'm tending to better never than late. Somehow, for me, the movie just fell flat and didn't please me to anything like the degree of its predecessor.Don't get me wrong, the Pixar animation is fantastic as always, but somewhere along the line, the story, characters and humour lack something. The outlawed super-heroes / aliens / mutants theme has been done to death, from the X-Men to the Marvel Civil War right up to the current Supergirl TV series, likewise the husband and wife role-reversal with Mr Incredible's turn as three super-babies and a super-dad again seemed old-hat while Elastigirl's elevation to solo superstardom also felt a little like a forced and belated concession to PC-dom.I'm trying now to remember a really funny, laugh-out-loud line or memorable eye-popping sequence and I find I can't. The sub-plot of Violet and her young beau reminded me of any number of 'Married With Children' episodes with like I said, a lack of good gags, plus Dash's characterisation was just irritating and new shape-shifting baby Jack-Jack (what kind of name is that?) even more so.For me, I found the film really dragged in places with its too predictable villain and unmemorable climax which no amount of flashy graphics could disguise. In truth I think that this sort of thing was done way better in 'Megamind', 'Despicable Me' and of course the first Incredibles feature.At leat I can't accuse it of being a quick cash-in but really this is one set of retired super-heroes which should have remained on the shelf.",3,2,4,9 February 2019
Saboteur," A hitch in time...
","Solid if not stolid Hitchcock war-time movie, it contains some imaginative scenes of typical Hitchcockian panache, but sags in the middle, is peopled with too many characters and while it picks up again for its justly famous climax atop the Statue of Liberty, is lacking somewhat in dramatic impact.Of course it's fun to see past and future Hitchcock motifs get aired, for instance, there's an innocent man in handcuffs befriended by an initially suspicious attractive girl, then there are the various pointers to 'North By North-West', both climaxing atop a national monument, the innocent hero encountering peril in the middle of nowhere and the hero's ingenuity in causing confusion at a party scene to effect an escape. The older wiser Hitch knew how to increase the potency of the high jeopardy scene the second time around, c.f. Cary Grant's rescue of Eva Marie Saint on Mt Rushmore, a character whom the audience cared about, rather than the plunge to his death of the Nazi sympathiser,spectacular as it is. That scene above Lady Liberty is a triumph of imagination and vision, but is by no means the only effective one here, take for instance the 'slot-machine' reaction shots to the bomb at the ship's launch or the comic insertions of Priscilla Lane's advertising billboards which provide an ironic commentary on the action. There's also the fleeing couple's meet-up with the travelling circus, an obvious but still cleverly written microcosm for the different standpoints on the War (one suspects Dorothy Parker's hand at the wheel for this scene).Truth to tell, there's probably a little too much speechifying which slows the action down. Also, it's pretty obvious that this is B-list casting when Hitchcock invariably worked better with marquee-names. Robert Cummings is pleasant and amiable enough, but has a slightly mincing gait and doesn't act anger too well. Lane is a touch better, sassy but lacking a little on warmth and glamour but the main kudos go to Otto Kruger as the sinister Tobin, the traitor hiding behind the veneer of respectability, like so many of Hitchcock's 'smiling villains'.I enjoyed it as I invariably enjoy almost every Hitchcock feature, especially from his Hollywood years, but this particular outing seems more like a stop on the road rather than a destination in itself.",6,2,4,17 May 2011
Spectre," In Spectre Bond
","This latest Bond apparently has the longest running time of any other in the franchise, nevertheless I still found its slow-quick-slow combination helped me satisfactorily to the end, where the slow are the exposition and love scenes, while the quick, of course are the set-piece action scenes.I liked the action scenes, the trademark blockbuster pre-titles sequence this time taking in an exciting in-helicopter fight while I appreciated the nods to later Bond fights in the big train fight between James and his man-mountain adversary, bringing to mind Connery vs Shaw in 'From Russia With Love' and Moore vs Kiel aka 'Jaws' in 'The Spy Who Loved Me' while seeing Bond strapped into a chair expected to die naturally recalls both 'Goldfinger' and 'Thunderball'. Likewise the introduction of a younger Blofeld character as Bond''s nemesis became obvious the minute I clapped eyes on his pet cat.So far, so respectful. I still didn't quite savour Bond bedding a woman half his age whose father he's watched commit suicide only days before, the justification claimed as the high they get after jointly killing a man, spurious in itself, although I think it was probably more down to Bond's unignorable lady-killing tradition, dubious as that can seem today. I didn't miss Judi Dench's 'M', preferring Ralph Fiennes in the part, but still can't get my head around the nerd playing 'Q'. The excellent Andrew Scott is underused in this latest turn against a fictional crime-fighting superman, disguised as a usurping Civil Servant with eyes on 'M's' chair, but didn't find Christoph Waltz quite malevolent enough as Blofeld. Craig just does what he usually does, namely mean and moody, but I do wish he'd let more light into his characterisation from time to time.I think the movie ticked all of the required boxes for a typical Bond film, besides those already mentioned there was naturally, a race-against-the-clock to track down a bomb in the final sequence, but I did feel both slightly manipulated in watching the action unfold and yet a touch disappointed as each sequence, obligatory car chase (I forgot), included, passed me by...Still it got from start to finish in chunks of typical high-powered action sequences and at least a little welcome window was shed on Bond's childhood and what motivated him to become a killing-machine.In the meantime, this film still counts as a better-than-average entry in the series",6,1,2,13 March 2016
Moon," Moon-age daydream
","It's an odd coincidence that Bowie pere et fils both broke through commercial,y with space-themed works, father David Bowie with his classic single 'Space Oddity' and son Duncan Jones with this offbeat science fiction movie. Both touch on themes of loneliness and remoteness too.Watching 'Moon' one is reminded of space-ship/station bound features of yesteryear, 'Silent Running' and of course '2001', but director Jones boldly limits us to almost a lone actor for the duration, albeit duplicated, if not triplicated and Sam Rockwell does a good job playing essentially two sides of his own persona. The plot takes a little figuring out, but centres on prolonging the working life of employees in dangerous environments and as such has some relevance to today's technology of using robots and nano-bots to do things we humans can't. It is though a bit of a po-faced watch, although I got the joke about Rockwell's alarm clock awakening him each day to the dulcet tunes of one-hit-wonder Chesney Hawkes 'The One And Only', which he patently isn't. The special effects are actually anything but, very Gerry Anderson circa 1965 model-sets but the story's not about SFX in any case.Maybe I just prefer my space-outpost dramas to have some rampaging evil monster on hand to up the body count, which is perhaps it didn't completely grab my attention, but it's a quirky story, with a decent twist, well told, even if it never quite took off for me.",5,2,10,17 January 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Who wants to see a great movie?
","There's a real buzz about this unlikely Oscar contender but it's fully merited. Danny Boyle's off-beat parable, with at its centre, the unlikely premise that a poor young 'phone-basher' (call centre worker) could win the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' grips the viewer immediately and conveys a marvellous episodic story, leaving some indelible images along the way.With a start that reminded me of the similar-territory Oscar-winning 'City of God', we are quickly introduced to the three main characters in their infancy Salim, the (street)-smarter, often crueler older brother, Jamil, the trusting, caring younger brother and Latika, the pretty young girl who crosses their path looking for shelter from the storm, just when they're all made orphans. From there, we're taken on the hugely entertaining journey through their lives as their paths criss-cross to a background of poverty, criminality and cruelty before we reach the deserved 'happy-ending' as Jamil and Latika finally come together.Boyle also makes India the star of the movie but not the 'Bollywood' version, (although I loved too the Bollywood concession over the final credits). Here, right from the start, we're landed in a grindingly poor 'shantytown' with piles of rubbish everywhere, are then moved into the shockingly cruel world of procured child-beggaring (where in a no-pun intended, twist on the enduring image of Fagin and Oliver, adult criminals think nothing of blinding young children to bring in more money from donors), graduating finally to adult crime with Salim's employment as hit man and Latika as in-house concubine to the same Mr Big gangster.The film is unusually constructed - just who is interrogating Jamil over his win and why it's not revealed until the plot is well advanced (and the answer is surprising too!) and the coincidental reason ('It is written') that this young man can answer all the questions on his way to the last question is cleverly fed to the audience as the movie progresses.The young actors are all terrific, each character goes through three stages as they grow to maturity and all nine are convincing. Director Boyle intersperses his rollicking story with myriad unforgettable images, (the early airborne shots of the shantytown village, Jamil emerging from (let's be polite) a dung-heap to claim the autograph of his Bollywood idol, young Latika standing outside in the rain, I could go on and on - realising these images are all from only the first 20 minutes. There's plenty of earthy humour too (plus, being Scottish, I laughed out loud at the call-centre interview with the 'wifie' from Kingussie - I've had that conversation, as I'm sure has director Boyle!) to leaven the toughness and severity of what surrounds it and of course a genuinely gripping climax too as Jamil, now a symbol of hope to the whole country gets asked the big question, that properly takes us back to the start as this story of our three young musketeers, although not without cost, is brought to a proper conclusion.A wonderful film, I'm still recalling other scenes, images and laughs even as I finish this. Do yourself a favour, ignore everything else at your local cinema and go see this.",8,1,3,7 February 2009
Donnie Darko," Crazy mixed up kid, crazy mixed up movie
","Too weird for me, I'm afraid. Very 'Twin Peaks', by which I mean, beguiling to the eye, challenging in parts but ultimately just too confusing and abstract for my sensibilities. The acting's fine, Jake Gyllenhaal in his breakthrough role as the disturbed teenager from whose perspective everything goes crazy, Jena Malone as the even more sensitive new girl in school with whom Donnie finds a kindred spirit and some established actors in unexpected roles, like Patrick Swayze, Katharine Ross and co-producer Drew Barrymore. The early 1980's soundtrack featuring the dark and brooding Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen and Tears for Fears chimes in well with Donnie's gloomy psychosis, but I could sit here for hours and still not précis the plot so I won't even try. Perhaps it's all in the words of the Tears for Fears song 'Mad World' played at the movie's end - 'the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had'. An arresting line and, maybe for a few minutes, an interesting thought but, for me, not enough to hang a movie on.",3,2,5,28 November 2007
Pocahontas," Indian reservations
","Just watched this film on a rainy stay-in Saturday afternoon and it fitted the bill nicely. A romanticised re-telling of the celebrated romance between English soldier John Smith and Indian princess Pocahontas, it entertains in the main even if it occasionally panders a little too much to the pre-teen market with just too many cute animals whose presence you think may, in true JarJar Binks style, have had more to do with spin-off merchandising than enhancing the narrative. The overly-idealised images of the dashingly handsome, heroic and muscular Smith and the gamine and exotic beauty of Pocahontas for me somehow manage to somehow belittle their characters, at the expense of credibility and I suspect, true audience sympathy, but in its favour, the film arrives at a not completely happy-ending which is to its credit.Of course, being a Disney film, there has to be an identifiable bad guy for our hero and heroine, here personified by the greedy, avaricious figure of Lord Ratcliffe who has commissioned the expedition in a last-gasp attempt to strike it rich with the discovery of gold and also enhance his failing social position at court back home. Again however, he's too broadly painted for my taste, massively corpulent and duplicitous from the start. Likewise the contrast between the uncaring colonialists and the innocent native Indians comes across as clumsy and clichéd too.Maybe I'm being too severe, as all Disney animated films seemingly must posit, for the kids as much as anyone else the big moral of good versus evil, but being based this time on a true story and not a fairy tale, felt more subtlety could have been observed in the telling.On the plus side, the songs are good, with clever lyrics, even if you're not exactly whistling them after the film is over and the animation is fluid and engaging, although again i didn't recall too many 'Wow!' stick-in-the-memory moments immediately afterwards. The voice acting too is mostly good although Billy Connolly's too-old and overly-recognisable broad Scottish accent jars occasionally.Maybe I'm being over-critical and it's easy to slightly denigrate the film with reference to previous Disney classics, but while pleasant enough, this didn't feel like one of the studio's very best outings.",6,0,1,26 October 2013
The Social Network," Out Come The Geeks
","Who would have thought a feature film could have been made about a bunch of nerdy students creating a web-site? I suppose though in the time-honoured fashion of the likes of 'The Paper Chase', 'Cider House Rules' and 'Good Will Hunting' there can be gold in campus drama,although the difference here of course is that this isn't fiction, being an account of how Mark Zuckerburg with a little help from his friends, got the concept of Facebook out of his head and onto the market, making billions in the process. You'd have thought, mind you, that was more than enough money for him to share, rather than allow himself to be embroiled in high-profile and no doubt expensive court-cases by some of the people he trod on and used to get to the top, but thin as it is, that's the premise for the movie.Right from the start, director Fincher shows Zuckerburg in an unflattering light, a geeky, self-centred, pretentious student who expects everyone to bow down to his intellect, but after his then girlfriend dumps him, a petty act of revenge on her leads to his Eureka moment in setting up an online club appealing principally to the young set.The film is highly watchable, due to the pacey direction and Aaron Sorkin's ear for needle-sharp dialogue, but some posters here are right when they say that this film probably wouldn't work as fiction at all and it's only our real-life interest in the background to one of the biggest business success stories of modern times which compels our attention. Certainly there are no likable main characters here, besides the venal Zuckerburg, his meal-ticket friend and partner Eduardo Saviano seems just too gullible to be true while Napster-king Sean Parker ruthlessly lords it over his adoring acolytes in repellent messianic rock-star style. I almost wished that Zuckerburg's girlfriend stayed in the film throughout (she turns up briefly again later) as she seemed by far the most credible and sympathetic character here. Seems to me she should have shared in the mega-wealth too, as she inadvertently inspired Zuckerburg in the first place!The acting by the leads is very good, none better than Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerburg, plus there's an excellent modern soundtrack courtesy of Trent Raznor. On the debit side, there's some uncalled-for gratuitous sex and Justin Timberlake is too big a celebrity to play big-nobody Parker. On the whole I'd probably hit the 'Like' button for this film, but consider it a bit overrated both by the Academy, where it received a Best Film Oscar nomination and probably the public at large including the community here.",6,1,2,20 August 2013
The Pursuit of Happyness," Trivial pursuit
","I didn't like this Will Smith feature at all. Was there really a movie in Christopher Gardiner's story of his struggle to preserve his relationship with his infant son, while striving for a shot at making big money in the world of stockbroking...? After sitting through this sentimental, obviously Oscar-targeted mush, I certainly didn't think so. It has all the appearance of a vanity project for Smith and I'm not just referring to the obvious nepotism of advancing his young son to main supporting actor alongside him.I see from the high IMDb score and indeed box office returns that this particular espousal of the American Dream found favour, principally, I would imagine with its home audience, but to me, it came across as corny, undramatic and ultimately boring. You can see Smith putting out for the Academy pretty much all the way through, his son can't act either and by the time he gets his big break at the end, I just felt manipulated. Inspirational...? I didn't think so. And why a film set in 1981 relies so heavily on an early 70's soundtrack featuring classics from Stevie Wonder and George Benson only added to my confusion.This film for me represents the worst of mainstream Hollywood, blatantly sentimental, heart-string tugging tosh of the worst kind.",2,2,7,13 January 2013
Back to the Future," The future's so bright
","I suppose like many people I got caught up in the whole 'it was 30 years ago today' shtick surrounding this movie of late and with a free Saturday afternoon indoors, with my wife watched this movie neither of us had seen since 1985. Thankfully, we both found it was just as much fun and exciting to see as all those years ago. I mean I'm an absolute sucker for any kind of time-travel stuff, especially the whole circular time, going-back-to-your-own-past-changing-your-own-future thing. I love how the film sometimes subtly, sometimes obviously sets up the prompts for future resolution, by so often doubling back on itself, but of course never lets all that timey-wimey stuff get in the way of what is at heart a rollicking, exciting, family entertainment.It helps that the casting is so good, Michael J Fox as the spirited, energetic teenager Marty McFly and the great Christopher Lloyd as the madcap scientist Doc Brown in the two lead roles but also the characters of Marty's gormless mum and dad and numb-skull bully Biff. The period-settings are lovingly and nostalgically rendered and the humour is sharp and relevant, as Marty straightens out the future lives of his whole family, actually saves the lives of his brother, sister and Doc while inventing rock and roll in the process!This really is a timeless entertainment and what better adjective could I use to describe it than that.",9,1,1,1 November 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," Second Bourne
","I found this sequel to 'The Bourne Identity' to be every bit as thrilling and satisfying as the first. Self-contained as each film is, the continuity from one to the next is laudable in treating the viewer with intelligence and respect. The film starts quietly with Jason and his girlfriend relaxing anonymously, or so they believe, in the bustling city of Goa in India. Of course we wouldn't have a film unless his past catches up with him again and so it proves.Besides Goa, the main action takes place in Berlin and a recreated Moscow, with touch-downs in London, Amsterdam and New York too. It's not long before Bourne has a personal motive for getting back on his own case again.With super-fast-cut editing, often using hand-held camera-shots, a pounding, electro-soundtrack and a minimum of dialogue (I sincerely hope Matt Damon wasn't getting paid by the word), it's a breathless, white-knuckle ride with superb action set-pieces accompanied by scenes of expository calm. There are two thrilling car-chases, especially the latter in a congested Moscow and one exciting fight sequence in a confined space between Bourne and a fellow-agent.I didn't think the film needed the teaser-ending which finishes the movie on an up rather than down-stroke, but given that it set up an even better follow-up movie, I can live with that. Intricately and believably plotted, brilliantly edited and with Damon at his driven best, this sequel is no sloppy second.",8,1,2,22 August 2015
The Great Gatsby," Not great Gatsby
","Almost 40 years on from the last Hollywood adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's modern classic comes Baz Lurrmann's take on the tale. To my eyes, the movie stays close to the novel as indeed did Robert Wise's 1974 version which starred Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, making me subconsciously compare actors as well as scenes which were similar in both movies.I have to say, I prefer the 70's version. It would be easy to chide Luhrmann's use of modern music for so much of the background music, so chide I will, I certainly don't want to be thinking of Beyonce Knowles in a too obvious stab at a younger audience, when watching a film that tries so hard in many other ways to capture the hedonistic 'Jazz Age' era of post-War, Prohibition-bound.Thus the director goes to town in the party scenes at Gatsby's home, but a lot of it seems like window-dressing. I have casting issues too with Tobey McGuire's simpering goofiness at odds with his character's crucial part as a detached witness. I also felt that Carey Mulligan failed to convince as the impressionable Daisy Buchanan and that as her husband likewise struggled to adequately counterpoint Leonardo DiCaprio's title role.Much will be made, no doubt of his pivotal portrayal of the doomed Gatsby. For me he acted naturally and with some style but failed to cast off an air of boyishness which for me was at odds with the deeper demands of his character. Nobody else leapt out at me either from the supporting cast, leaving me with the overall impression that the film, though pretty on-the-eye is let down by its actors who steadfastly refuse to leap off the printed page and imbed themselves in the memory.The shifting narrative view-point didn't help much either so that in the end I was forced to the admittedly obvious conclusion about the film serving the eye better than the brain.",6,1,2,20 May 2013
The Proposal," Decent proposal
","For at least the first half of its running time, I found this a reasonably amusing rom-com. Unfortunately, the plague of sentimentality sets in for the second half, reducing the laugh count and increasing the cringe factor to the movie's overall detriment.Those early scenes, almost exactly mirroring the opening shots of the similarly plotted 'The Devil Wears Prada', raise a good few smiles as Sandra Bullock's hard-nosed career-obsessed uber-bitch walks all over her winsome P.A., country-boy-in-the-big-city Ryan Reynolds and everyone else in the major publishing house until she gets a call from the Immigration Service on her right to stay in the good old U S of A. Cue her impromptu solution, an immediate engagement to nice-guy Reynolds and their visit to his native Alaska, ostensibly to celebrate his grandmother's 90th birthday but ultimately to break the news of their sudden engagement to his nearest and dearest.The funniest scenes are those where ice-maiden Bullock gets her iceberg chipped away by the dottiness and homeliness of Reynolds and his family - her meet-up with granny Betty White in the woods chanting out her alternative mantra is hilarious as is her encounter with the only male stripper in town at a girls' night out organised by her to be on-laws.Of course given that this is a Sandra Bullock starring vehicle, I should have accepted her thawing out to reveal a marshmallow centre that Reynolds unaccountably warms to - his still-interested old girl-friend seems a much better match for him, plus of course Reynolds gets to sort out his difficulties with his stubborn old dad along the way.The acting is pleasant enough, Bullock, better when she's playing the toughie than the sap, Reynolds nicely underplaying in the fashion of his near lookalike predecessor in films of this type from a previous generation, Ryan O'Neal. Mary Steenburgen, whom I've loved since her introduction to me in 'Tender Is The Night' about 30 years ago, is the best looking female in the film however; although she doesn't get much to do, I'm pleased to see her still getting parts in big Hollywood films.As I said, it's a pity that the film lost its way for me on its path to the inevitable happy ending, but as modern-day family entertainment, this wasn't bad at all.",5,1,1,13 September 2010
Valkyrie," Wrong way Valkyrie
","The age-old Hollywood problem of how to recreate a famous historical event either through realism or accentuation rears its head again in this Bryan Singer-helmed Tom Cruise-starring depiction of the failed von Stauffenburg assassination attempt on Hitler which, if successful could have changed the direction of the Second World War.A studier of history like myself, while pleased in a way to see the bravery of Von Stauffenburg and his cohorts recognised in film does however think that a more truthful low-key approach would have served this serious subject matter better. However what we get here is a sort of 'Mission Impossible' for the war era with real life characters reduced to Hollywood-created ciphers and while the film acquires a kinetic energy as it moves towards its doomed conclusion, as stated, the film-maker takes the easy option of giving it the big blockbuster treatment, with over-intrusive soundtrack, various skillful but irrelevant camera tricks and worst of all dialogue which rates alongside 'Braveheart' and 'Pearl Harbour' for (lack of) weight and substance.On the plus side, the production values are top-notch, with excellent sets, costumes and particularly the utilisation of period motor and flying vehicles. However, we again get the wild assortment of accents as none of the heavyweight UK/US cast attempt even the semblance of a German accent throughout the whole movie (even Hitler!) and yet every printed word on display is in the original German. The acting is okay although Cruise is of course just wrong, wrong, wrong in the central part - I was reminded of Cary Grant in 'The Pride and The Passion' or even Errol Flynn as General Custer and nobody else really rises above playing the uniforms - no-one actor appears at any time to really inhabit their role, which is the least I'd say they owe to the memory of this brave band of conspirators.The impact (no pun intended) of the crucial bomb scene is again weakened by the crassness of the heightened build-up to the event in time-worn thriller-style and whilst the fall-out scenes which follow as the fortunes of the attempted coup flow and inevitably ebb better draw in the viewer, by then the overall effect has been diminished by what has gone before.Maybe I'm too precious about matters of authentication but I feel the big-budget action-suspense approach taken here works only with fictional stories and that screen adaptations of actual war-time events benefit immeasurably from a more realistic, documentary-style approach. If you want to see my point in action check out 'Downfall', a quite brilliant German-language production covering the last days of the Third Reich which manages to harrowingly but engrossingly grip the viewer until the bitter end.",5,0,1,12 July 2009
All the President's Men," Vice president...
","I've had this movie taped for a long time and kept putting off the pleasure I knew I'd get from viewing it until I was sparked by recently watching Kevin MacDonald's excellent modern-day fictional journalistic thriller 'State of Play' to find Pakula's 70's drama put forward as an inspiration and for some scenes, indeed, a template for his film. Also as a young man in the 70's I remember avidly reading the source book by Wood-stein, the composite abbreviation for the two investigative journalists, add to which I'm a fan of Pakula's socially conscious but detached style anyway (especially 'The Parallax View' from a couple of years earlier) so that I gladly settled in for the night to view this lengthy feature.Like his earlier 'Klute' and 'The Parallax View', Pakula gets your attention straight away with an arresting opening image - this time that gun-shot type report that the typewriter makes as it hammers out the dateline for the action which is about to follow. The thing is of course that this would have been almost as good a film as it turns out to be even if the events portrayed were fictional, but of course there's that extra frisson knowing that the events and people depicted are real and contemporary.The star-power of the two leads could also have blown credibility out of the water but whilst you're pretty much always aware that it's Redford & Hoffman you're watching, nevertheless they unquestionably fully immerse themselves in the parts, especially as they beetle about the everyday, frustrating, often boring part of being a reporter. They're backed by a top-rate supporting cast, prominent amongst these being Jason Robards, Ned Beatty & Martin Balsam. The environment of a big newspaper office is especially well conveyed in the sprawling working area.The cinematography, as usual with Pakula, is first rate, particularly the night shots of Redford/Woodward's encounters with the mysterious 'Deep Throat' in the underground car park. Pakula keeps giving us the same long-shot of Redford's tiny figure going downstairs into the car park, which, mythical connotations apart, only further emphasises his smallness against the scale of the giant task he and his paper are taking on. The attention to detail is particularly gripping, the way that the journalists check and cross-verify their sources before daring to go to print - who'd have thought a newspaper procedural could be so involving.The main reason for this of course is the prize at the end of the trail as Woodward and Bernstein, in the famous phrase 'follow the money' all the way to Tricky Dicky Nixon's White House culminating in his resignation and the conviction and imprisonment of most of his underlings. The only thing I didn't like really was the, to me, rushed finish. Even as I got the irony in Nixon's televised acceptance speech in early 1973 playing on a newsroom TV while the reporters keep typing, obviously continuing the investigation until the purge of the president's men is complete, it felt forced. Archive footage of Nixon and Agnew is used elsewhere in the film and therefore I can't think why Nixon's famous televised speeches as the case engulfed him, particularly his resignation speech, were ignored. There's no single moment where the link to Nixon (and his infamous White House tapes) is made which I hope wasn't made out of expediency.That carp apart, this film was one of the dramatic highlights of 70's Hollywood movie-making representing bravery on the part of its producers (Redford amongst them) to get out there this defiant defence of freedom of speech and the press in gone-wrong 70's America. Hail to the thief indeed!",8,1,1,21 October 2009
The Wizard of Oz," Wonderful 'Wizard of Oz'
","Still one of the best children's fantasy adventure films ever - with songs! The use of colour in a film has never been surpassed in my view, making the contrast from dusty, grey Kansas to perfect, day-glo Oz all the more telling, and making you realise what an inspired cinematic idea it was! The point has been well made before, but you do have to wonder why Dorothy would ever want to leave the fairy-tale world, until you consider the moral point of the movie which is to celebrate family and home life, even if the grass is literally greener on the other side.The special effects are remarkable for the time, from the devastation of the tornado, the monumental city of Oz and even the comings and goings of Glinda the good witch. Probably the only sub-standard scenes of this type are those of the wicked witch flying on her broomstick, but perhaps I'm being too post-modern in my judgement. The characterisations are mostly delightful, my only carps being that Glinda is just too glutinous to be true, plus I never really cared much for the Munchkins.. Outstanding in the cast naturally is Judy Garland as Dorothy, displaying childish insecurity on the one hand but feisty perseverance on the other. She interacts beautifully and naturally with her three new friends and even Toto! The songs are unforgettable too, 'Over The Rainbow' and 'We're Off To See The Wizard' especially being songs for the ages . I've seen the film many times, naturally, but it's still a remarkable feat of artistic creativity and to mind hasn't been matched never mind surpassed by any number of real-life Disney or Pixar films since.",8,4,5,22 March 2012
From Here to Eternity," Pearl and the shells
","Classic 50's Hollywood feature documenting the lives and times of the US Army personnel in Hawaii leading up to the Japanese air attack on the Pearl Harbour naval base which precipitated the US entry into the second world war. Shot in black and white by Fred Zinnemann to emphasise the war-time setting, the drama is peopled with convincingly realistic characters with a credible, episodic narrative edging ever closer to the pivotal date of December 7th.Multiple plot lines are skilfully interwoven until their climactic convergence at the end aided by top acting from a superb cast. The dramatic thread to the film is Montgomery Clift's Prewett character and his relationships with the characters played by Burt Lancaster, the firm but fair sergeant himself drawn into a sexually charged relationship with his superior officer captain's disaffected wife, played against type by Deborah Kerr, Donna Reed as the 'hostess' he falls in love with and especially Frank Sinatra's rascally but likeable and always supportive Maggio.Sinatra famously begged for the chance to show his acting skill in a straight role to reignite his career and duly given the chance, he grabs it with both hands. Lancaster and Kerr fire up the screen in their doomed relationship, especially in the famous scene by the crashing waves, Reed plays her part with admirable restraint but Clift's acting exceeds them all, whether in his reluctant fight scenes, blowing a bugle like Satchmo or playing a drunk after he's exacted revenge on Maggio's tormentor, played memorably by the recently deceased Ernst Borgnine.The action climax as the Japanese attack is thrillingly portrayed especially the high camera shots, although I would question the too obvious and thus jarring insertion of real footage of the actual attack.Controversial in its day for its unblinkingly honest depiction of the US army, it can be seen now as one of the best films of the 50's, a master class in dramatic narrative and character acting.",9,8,9,28 July 2012
Atonement," What a difference a day makes...
","Not having read the source novel, I came to this much-praised adaptation with open eyes and ears and left at the end impressed by its undoubted polish and keen insight into the damaged psyches of its ill-served star-crossed lovers, played with credibility and engagement by young talents McAvoy and Knightley. For me, there were minor echoes of Joseph Losey's work of the 60's and 70's, borrowing a little of the multiple viewpoint technique of 'Accident' and the retrospective narrative-framing style of 'The Go-Between' (not to mention the latter's shared theme of the innocence of teenage children corrupted by a too-close proximity to the physical passions of their elders). Beautifully if a little showily shot and excellently played, the careful plotting is stylishly arranged for the viewer and to me only drags occasionally, with too-long scenes involving the hapless, exiled gone-for-a-soldier Robbie (McAvoy) winding up at the apparently shambolic Dunkirk beaches before 'The Miracle' evacuation took place and '18 year-old Briony's' scene at the hospital with a dying French soldier. Well shot and acted as these scenes are, (the former, in particular, featuring a too-deliberately flashy 'Tara'/'Gone With The Wind'-type 5-minute tracking shot passing through the Dunkirk site), for me pointed up a detrimental stylisation at play here and also slowed down the action too much especially as the final denouement is so effective in its ingenious invention and crisp depiction. Pre-War England is beautifully conveyed in its mansion-house glory, but beneath the veneer of manners and respectability seething passions drive the inhabitants, young and old, to extreme courses of action which change their lives forever. Although built around the strong performances of lovers McAvoy (natural and humane) and Knightley (ethereal and passionate), the remainder of the acting is also completely in simpatico, with the three actresses who depict the maturing touch-paper-lighting Briony, doing so to excellent effect. If in the end a touch too mannered and clever for its own good, this well-made film shows that even today imaginative period drama can entertain far better than any number of comic-book hero extravaganzas. Sadly ironic in a postscript that this was one of the final appearances by another purveyor of quality drama, the late Anthony Minghella, in a brief, almost unnoticed part as the elderly Briony's TV interviewer. One suspects he would very much have approved of director Wright and his team's work here.",7,0,1,23 November 2008
