The Blair Witch Project," These people are stupid.
","Ok, I saw BWP on Showtime a few weeks ago with low expectations.  It was actually better than I thought it would be.  However, it was far from perfect.  First and foremost, I have to bring up how unprepared the students were.  If I went into the woods I would bring flairs, two cel phones and four batteries, an emergency phone, matches, a lighter, a radio, a GPS and tons of food.  Also, everyone knows that when you plan on going into the woods (or mountains, or anything like that), you tell all your friends when you intend on coming back. That way, if you are gone for even a day extra, you have a search team looking for you.SPOILER >Second of all, how STUPID would anyone be to throw away the only map they had?  I couldn't believe that anyone could be that dumb.  Oh, yeah, and not to mention the continuity errors which ruined any sense of realism that I had.  For example, after Josh dissapears, there is a shot of Heather and Mike leaning on a tree, next to each other.  Suddenly, the camera cuts to a shot of them rocking back and forth.  Ok, so who turned off the camera? Josh?  No, Josh was gone.  It didnt' turn itself off.  There are many instances of this, but I won't mention them all.One thing that many people complained about was the swearing.  People say, 'The whole movie was just three kids swearing'.  Well, I hate to break it to you, but that's how kids act.  I don'tswear any less around my friends than they did in the movie, and that added a touch of realism to my perception of the film.  And, to the film's credit, the ending was superb.  So basically, It was worth seeing, but not a classic or anything.",Null,0,1,2 August 2000
