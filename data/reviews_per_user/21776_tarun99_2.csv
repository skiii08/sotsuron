The Avengers," The Dark Knight Has A New Challenger
","As usual for a Hollywood movie of this scale was hyped,received good reviews but i had a doubt if the movie could deliver what it promised Pure fun. And it sure as hell delivered excitement,thrill,action and everything you want from a Superhero movie with a JOSS WHEDON Touch.The way the characters interact from the beginning to the End is fun.RDJ-Always at you with witty one Liners. CHRIS EVANS-Maintains the Character he built in Captain America. CHRIS HEMSWORTH-Well he continues the Story arc from Thor of brother vs brother.MARK RUFFALO-What an amazing addition to the Cast.The Hulk really stands out in the movie LOKI- Pure Menace Hawkeye-Perfectly Cast BLACK WIDOW-Looks Do Kill.",10,2,7,3 May 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," First impression is not the last impression
","As a person unknown to the franchise this movie i thought would be an action packed movie as suggested by the trailers but after entering into the cinema hall.Almost half an hour into the movie it made me realize that movie very nicely captured the emotional connection between the Ape(Andy Serkis) & James Franco . The movie didn't have problem establishing the characters.The movie is about Will(James) trying to cure Alzheimer's disease which is tested on apes .But due to some reason's the medicine is to be dropped. The actor's in the James Franco,Andy Serkis (in his animated avatar) make the movie an enjoying experience.The story is interesting & the way that the director handles it is quite awesome .I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends.",8,4,7,28 August 2011
