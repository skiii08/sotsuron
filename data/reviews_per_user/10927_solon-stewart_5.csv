The Hangover," A bit Overrated
","I just had to comment because I think people are a little out of hand on this movie. I am a big fan of comedies, and usually make it to most of the big ones in theaters. I heard a lot of hype before going to see it, left the movie with a smile on my face, but my sides and cheeks didn't hurt. Thats how you can tell if a movie is really funny. Comparing it to recent comedies to come out I would rate it below the likes of Tropic Thunder, Pinapple Express, Borat, Superbad, 40 Year Old Virgin. It was probably on par with Step Brothers, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up (also overrated), etc. It was a solid, good funny movie, but has no business being on the top 250 list, and being one of the top comedies of all time (according to the list). There were laughs, but I never found myself sucking for air or bending over cause my sides hurt, which I did for the previously mentioned movies. 6/10",6,2,6,24 July 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Rip Off of 'Lord Of The Rings'
","I never read any of the books and have seen about half the movies. I went to the movie expecting it to be pretty good and enjoyable. Instead, I just found myself getting upset. J.K. Rowling just totally rips off of the Legend himself, J.R.R. Tolkien. Even down to the Initial first names.'We have to leave now. We can't bring the others with us. Just the 'original 3 people. We can't trust the others' (Sound a lot like Samwise and Frodo ditching the rest of the fellowship)'A locket that cannot be broken. It must be broken to destroy the evil guy. Whenever you wear the locket it makes you irritable, mad, and say things you don't want to' (Ring) Really?!?!And near the end, 'The one wand that is more powerful than any other wand. One Wand to Rule them all' (Ring)What a lame rip off. And this is after i had heard for year about how creative Ms. Rowling is. How she invented this amazing world. I have listened to dozens of people drone on about how original her magical world was. Seems to me she realized she was a bad author, decided to change her name to mimic the master, and then bite off his masterpiece. A waste of 3 hours and 10 bucks I wish i could get back. No more for this plagiarist. Harry Potter Sucks",4,2,4,30 November 2010
District 9," Oops, A bit Over-hyped
","So didn't really know anything about this movie before going to see it. Some people said it was good, and I saw it was #54 on the Top 250 list. So I decided to go check it out with this hot girl. One of the Worst moves I've ever made. She hated the style of filming and got super creeped/weirded/grossed out by everything. You know how maybe going to a 'Romatic Comedy' or Titanic or something might get you laid? District 9 will get you un-laid, if that is possible. So major bummer on that front. For me, I usually like these movies. Aliens are pretty cool, but these ones were just OK. I liked their eyes-very realistic, but there bodies were really weird/gross. The story was somewhat interesting-a play on the racism still present in South Africa, but it seemed to have some holes. Like how did they understand what the aliens said? Why did they have to have all these legal eviction notices for the Prawns? It was different from most Alien movies, not really in a good way. I mean-you had your regular cool alien guns, and some other stuff, but meh-Over-hyped. Not a Top 50 movie of all time-thats for sure. Overall-don't take a girl that you want to get lucky with-bad plan...",5,0,3,14 September 2009
Thor," Lord of the Rings on Crack
","It was pretty meh. Nothing too special about this film. Gods fighting each other and not dying even while they are impaled by icey daggers. I though all the earth scenes were pretty useless and boring. The fight on the fantasy worlds were the best part, and they should have just stuck with that. It was a lot like Avatar, but not done as well. Good visuals but a stupid and predictable story. All the names of cites and the characters throughout the film reminded me way too much of LOTR. I wished they had made a completely different earth story. Earth was never in danger or anything. All the important stuff was done in the other realms, so it seemed stupid to make earth so central. Portman was pretty lousy in this too. 5/10",5,2,8,2 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Underwhelmed
","I was really excited to see this movie, more so than any other movie this summer. After watching it this afternoon, I have to say I was underwhelmed. While I thought the cinematography was quite dramatic, with Pittsburgh and Jodhpur, India providing dramatic scenery, some of the story lines fell flat. Comparing this film the Nolan's last two films, the Dark Knight and Inception, it feels like the story just wasn't as well written. The twists we're OK, nothing mindblowing, and there were a few holes in the plot. But I think it really just came down to the Villains in the movie. What made Dark Knight so great was that The Joker was such a great character. Bane? Not so much. He was strong and punched hard, but wasn't quite evil enough. I expected more.",7,7,14,22 July 2012
