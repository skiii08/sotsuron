Scarface," This is THE 80s Gangster Flick!
","Miami, sunshine, art deco, cash, greed, murder, guns, girls, big hair, ruthless Hispanic criminals brought to the big screen just when the public was first starting to hear about the drug cartels. A year later the ever popular Miami Vice came to the small screen and captivated viewers. Scarface is where it all started.",8,0,1,30 September 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," We've all been there.
","Better than most romantic comedies these days; this one was actually a little unpredictable (younever knew what she was going to come up with next) and entertaining.You can really see Goldie Hawn in Kate Hudson, and this is a good thing. I kept envisioning Kate as Goldie in Foul Play and Seems Like Old Times. She has a good future if she picks the right films.",7,0,0,21 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Spectacular!!!!
","I hadn't read the books since I was a teenager in the late 70s and what I remembered of the story was not much. But, the movie brought it all back.
It was everything that I had pictured in my mind's eye 25 years ago. Casting was absolutely perfect and while I was worried that special effects would overwhelm the film, they were discrete, and subtle enough to go relatively un-noticed. The one complaint I have is with the DVD version where the sound is uneven; music too loud and dialogue too soft. For the best effect catch it on the big screen. Hopefully, they will correct this for the Director's cut.

Cast Away," If you're going, skip the trailer.
","I like Tom Hanks as an actor. In many ways, I think he's the modern Jimmy Stewart; an everyman. Could another actor have pulled off Cast Away and made it such a hit? I doubt it. Few have Hanks' appeal.Cast Away is not without one, fairly large, problem. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. The details you don't see, with an exception or two, are minor and, I won't spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, not much missed.Still, I recommend it. It's FAR better than lots of the stuff they give us these days.",6,0,1,29 January 2001
Men in Black II," 50/50
","The first half of the movie had some good bits but I swear the dog had all the good lines.  The second half will make you want to see the first half again.  Could have been great, but turned into way more computer generated special effects than I wanted to see. At times, I wondered if Smith and Jones were also computer generated.  5/10",5,0,0,31 July 2003
Heat," Teriffic, but limited.
","The first time you see this film, providing you're a fan of actioners, DeNiro, Pacino, and the rest of a great cast, you'll be amazed and riveted to your seat.  I promise, you will enjoy every second of this movie.
The bank robbery scenes alone are worth your time, but there's a lot more. Heros, anti-heros, good cops with angst, bad crooks, good crooks, it's hard to tell with whom you should sympathize. Rent it.",8,0,2,21 July 2003
Gladiator," Empire Intrigue
","I saw Gladiator this weekend and I have to say I'm not sure what all the hype was about. The story is only fair and the characters flat; and, at over two and a half hours, there was ample time for much better story and character development.  Unlike Braveheart, and The Patriot, two other recent period epics, I was never drawn into the story, never became involved emotionally with the characters, never really cared. And, Crowe seems to play the same character in many of his movies; it's time for less grunting. It was nice to see Richard Harris, I wish he'd do more.If you see it, see it for the scenery and the special effects; they are FANTASTIC.  I remember watching Titanic and being able to pick out the people and scenery that was computer generated. Not so in Gladiator.  Rome looks like it's real, nothing short of amazing.The blood and gore, if you worry about that kind of thing, wasn't as bad as some have said; in fact, there was much less than I expected.Worth the time if you must. But 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' was better.",5,0,0,29 January 2001
