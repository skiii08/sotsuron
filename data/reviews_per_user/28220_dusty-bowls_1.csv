Black Swan," Are you kidding?!
","The only reason I give this garbage a three is the amazing orchestral score and the ecstasy seen with Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman. The rest is just TERRIBLE!! Who was bought off to rate this trash so highly? The predictability alone was enough to turn it off after fifteen minutes. I loathe ballets and yet I would rather endure, what seemed to be a decent play, The Swan Queen, than this.. there is no word for how stupid... Every turning point was predictable and as for 'horror'; if bloody fingernails are horrific.. ?? I can't imagine a person who would enjoy this film. If you like the backstage of ballet, then thirty minutes might tantalize your interest. An endeavor to get through..",3,1,4,15 April 2011
