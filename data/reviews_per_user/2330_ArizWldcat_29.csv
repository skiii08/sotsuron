United 93," Overwhelming
","Paul Greengrass and company took a unique approach to this film. The viewer feels as if she or he was right there in the room as the action progressed. As the roomful of air traffic controllers realize that one of the WTC towers has been hit, there is a stunned disbelief, followed by the logical statement that that gaping hole couldn't have been made by a Cessna (as was first reported...a small private plane has hit the WTC). Then, when the second plane hit, stunned silence, followed by yelling to keep moving...there is work to be done. What would have helped me would have been a small clock in the bottom of the screen...it was difficult to keep focused on where in time we were, and I was a bit confused at the end (minor spoiler) because it says that the military was not notified that 93 had been hijacked until 4 min. after it crashed, but the air traffic controllers were talking about it well before it crashed in the film. That said, this felt so real! There was no melodrama. Many of the air traffic controllers portrayed themselves; the actors portraying the passengers (and hijackers) were unknowns. The passengers look like real people...they were all sizes and ages (except, thank the Lord, no children!!) and some were without makeup, just as in real life. What a stunning movie. I wept several times as the enormity of how much our lives changed that day hit me over and over again. I recommend it. It's not easy to watch, but worth seeing.",10,2,4,1 May 2006
The Notebook," Tearjerker chick flick
","I didn't like the book for this movie, and thus stayed away for a while, but on the recommendation of a friend, I went ahead and saw this.  It is definitely a chick flick, but I found it to be well acted and a compelling story.  I thought the actor who played Lon, however, looked more like James Garner than Ryan Gosling did...and I guess it was a little unbelievable that the girl would pick him, looking as bedraggled as he did, over the good look rich guy...but maybe that's just me :)  When the older James Garner was looking at the photo albums, I almost laughed because it was quite a transformation...Gosling looks nothing like Garner.  Other than that, though, the movie was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Don't forget your kleenex!",7,1,1,30 July 2004
Madagascar," Fun movie for the family
","There are so few movies that you can enjoy as a family, so perhaps I've given this more stars than it deserves. I did laugh out loud several times. The jokes are mostly 'pop culture' references; for example, (the zebra (Chris Rock) has a treadmill in his area (not a cage, really) at the zoo.This is sort of a twist on the fish out of water movies, as the zoo animals, according to the local animal rights activists, don't belong in the zoo; they are shipped off to Africa. Hilarity ensues; the animals don't end up at the planned destination and find out that they don't necessarily belong in the wild either. What I found unique about this movie is that for once, the actual nature of the animal is acknowledged. Ben Stiller's lion character realizes that everyone looks like a steak and wants to eat everyone. Of course, he realizes that he's 'wrong' (HUH??) and tries to change. The kids loved it, I wasn't totally bored out of my mind, and the animation was pretty good, I thought. The penguins were especially cute. Wish they'd had more screen time.",7,70,106,2 June 2005
Superbad," Loved the message, but
","It was really hard to know how to rate this movie. Had I not read lots of reviews and known that it was going to end up being a somewhat good movie, I may have left early. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie attempts to cram in as much offensive language as possible. The pornography references truly, truly offended me. However. Beneath all the shocking language, there truly is a heart. I found this movie to be surprisingly touching and sweet. They did 'go' a few places I wish they hadn't. Every time I think I've seen it all, Hollywood adds in something new and more offensive than I've seen before. I can't help but wish they'd toned down the porn stuff and the language. Without it, there is still enough funny material for a good movie. So, I do recommend this to people who can get past the offensiveness, as I said, after the first half hour or so, it improves somewhat and there really is a nice story and a (gasp) good message in there.",7,1,4,31 August 2007
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Slightly funny, but not enough to recommend it
","This movie had postential, but didn't live up to it.  Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey have not a little chemistry, and they are fun to watch.  However, as this movie progressed, Kate's character's tricks got to be more mean than funny, and as a result, I stopped laughing and just felt sorry for McConaughey's character.  The scene where he takes her to meet his family, and she stops (temporarilY) acting like a little jerk, were actually the best in the movie.  The climactic scene at the diamond party resembled the worst of the Jerry Springer (et al) show where people hurt each other in public.  YUCK.  I find it a little depressing that the female characters in this movie regard having sex with someone one has only known a week to be normal and expected.  If that makes me a prude, so be it.  If you MUSt see this movie, wait for it to come to video and rent it.",4,3,6,21 February 2003
Hot Fuzz," Funny; a but overrated and much, much too long
","I have to say that I enjoyed this movie; however, there were way too many explosions for my taste. I guess that's part of the point, since this is a spoof of many other 'buddy' films. I have never seen Shaun of the Dead (nor will I), so I guess a lot of the humor is lost on me. However, I AM a major Anglophile, and many of my favorite Brits are in this movie, so it was enjoyable if just for that. I chose to go to this movie due to slim pickings at the local multiplex (there just isn't much out there that appeals to me; most of the romantic comedies out there are receiving poor, poor reviews)...and the 89% recommendation on rotten tomatoes.com...I have to say that I don't think this deserves THAT much high praise. I did have a lot of laughs, but also, this went just a tad too long, and had me glancing at my watch every few minutes during the middle of it. The ending, I thought, was a little too drawn out. minor spoiler.... After about 5 solid minutes of carnage, I'd had enough, but it went on and on and on after that. Timothy Dalton shines in this, as does Simon Pegg. Worth seeing, but didn't knock my socks off.",7,0,4,11 May 2007
Once," Good film
","I saw this at Sundance 2007, and was thrilled to see the director and the two stars of the film at our screening in Salt Lake City. What a treat! I must say 2007 has been a great year; of the 8 movies I have screened so far, 6 of them have had members of the crew or cast there to answer our questions. What a great experience this has been. Once is a movie about a street singer in Ireland. He hasn't had much success, but his luck changes when he meets a beautiful Czech who happens to have a great deal of talent as well. The two of them write songs together and this movie tells the story of their journey to make a CD. The music was not my particular favorite genre of music, but the two of them have quite a bit of talent and I enjoyed the music anyway. I recommend this movie!",8,8,13,24 January 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Ms. Streep saves the day
","I wasn't really impressed with the book, but I thought the cast of this film could possibly make it into a good movie. Meryl Streep was absolutely fabulous and believable as the quietly bitchy boss from hell. Anne Hathaway, in my opinion, was miscast as Andy Sachs, the hapless wannabe journalist who is hired to be an assistant to Streep's character, who is the editor of THE fashion magazine. I never bought that Hathaway had transformed into the kind of person she'd never wanted to be. She just seems like her sweet self throughout the entire movie, regardless of her change of wardrobe. Her so called transformation needed to be much more obvious in order for the film to truly work. The nasty assistant, Emily, played by Emily Blunt, nearly steals the show. And of course, Stanley Tucci is his usual brilliant self. His part of the story, unfortunately, is too marginal to make a difference. The group of young people who play Andy's friends are also not given enough of a role. The movie was fairly true to the book, which might be its main problem. All in all, not a bad way to spend an afternoon, but this probably won't be a DVD that joins our personal collection.",6,0,0,14 July 2006
Bridget Jones's Diary," What's not to like?
","I have to be honest, though...my husband and I saw this together the first time (in the theaters) and he didn't HATE it but also he didn't 'get' the humor.  I, on the other hand, was rolling in the aisles.  I had to buy this as soon as it hit the video stores.  I wasn't sure I was going to like Renee Zellweger as the British lead, but she pulled off her accent reasonably well...and Hugh Grant was excellent as her jerky boss.  And then there's Colin Firth!  ...also good were Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones as Bridget's mum and dad.  The director kept this movie short and sweet, and the humor works.  My guess is that women will like this movie more than men will.  I loved it.",9,1,1,12 February 2003
The Aviator," Not a bad effort, but much too long
","Leonardo DiCaprio is marvelous in this movie as the title character. Especially during the Senate hearings, he looks and acts uncannily like Howard Hughes. I was quite fascinated by the movie, especially at first. We learn about Howard Hughes's wide array of interests, including aviation, film-making and actresses. I have read that many like Cate Blanchett as Kathrarine Hepburn. I found that she was a little too exaggerated with her accent, and that distracted me. She did look a lot like Ms Hepburn, though. After the first hour or so, however, the movie started to drag. Yes, we know that Mr. Hughes was rather eccentric and he was (frankly) a little nuts. But all the scenes (slight spoiler) where he's naked in his screening room peeing into bottles get long and monotonous and, yes, boring. I guess I don't mind admitting that I was confused. The movie doesn't really explain (other than blaming Howard's mother in the first scene of the movie) why he was such an obsessive compulsive when it came to cleanliness...and how that obsession turned into madness. I did find it interesting ( if this movie is to be accepted as fact...I somehow doubt it) that while he was in the midst of a break down, he was able to pull himself out of it to appear before congress. Anyway, the movie was worth seeing, but I don't believe it deserves the raves it got.",6,1,3,7 February 2005
Radio," Touching feel good family film
","I always complain that Hollywood doesn't make any family films, and as those go, this is a fine movie!  Yes, it's sentimental...but you can't dispute that there is a real life person nick named Radio and he appears to be a well loved member of his community, as does Coach Jones (Ed Harris's character).  I thought that Cuba Gooding did a good job, and that it's unfortunate for him that this has already been done (slightly better) by Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. ( Audiences and critics aren't very forgiving of something they don't think is original.  This is different from FG is several ways, of course...it's a true story, whereas FG is rather fanciful and is based on a fictional novel. )  Anyway, this is a movie you can watch with your family and  everyone will enjoy it.  It's not Oscar caliber, but it's a good story.  This used to be the norm for movies (A good story the whole family can watch together), and it's getting more and more rare these days.  Therefore, I highly recommend this movie.",4,0,0,28 February 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Hilarious! I loved this fun, but slightly dark comedy
","We were happy to have had the chance to see this at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. I loved the cast: Greg Kinear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steve Carrell were ALL marvelous as the dysfunctional family. Little Miss Sunshine refers to a pageant to be held in California (the movie never states where the family lives, but most of the road scenes were definitely in the Phoenix, Arizona area. (added 8/2/06: I know now that the movie is set in New Mexico, for those of you who are interested in that sort of thing!)The story follows little Olive, a normal child, who by a fluke wins her way into the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The family decides they must accompany her in their old VW bus, so a road trip ensues.The final third of the movie, which deals with the actual pageant, is by far the funniest part of the film. It illustrates, with great hilarity, the frightening people who are involved in child pageants. You can't help rooting for Olive, who is refreshingly normal amongst the frighteningly plastic other contestants.(After discovering that I was in the (opposite of loved it) category on IMDb, I changed my subject line, because this was one of the best movies I've seen all year!! I LOVED IT)This is NOT a movie for children. After reading through some other user comments, I have to say I'm dismayed by the amount of people complaining about the F word. This movie is rated R, mostly because of its frequent use of the F word, along with some drug use. If you do 5 minutes of research before you go to a movie, you should educate yourself as to WHY a movie is rated the way it is. If you are offended by swearing, then, if you go to a movie that is rated R because of language, be prepared to be offended! Okay, I'm off the soapbox. This is NOT a movie for children.",9,259,397,10 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Not quite as good as the other two, but almost
","I love the wonderful casting choices the directors of these films consistently make!  Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny was an inspired choice!  What a hoot.  I wish the filmmakers hadn't cut this film to ribbons, though.  Clearly, there must have been other scenes featuring 'the emmas' (Watson and Thompson).  In the book, if I remember right, there are lots more sparks that fly between the two.  I wanted to see more of Emma Thompson!  Also, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was absolutely marvelous.  I sure hope he signs on for the future films.  He's always been a favorite of mine, anyway.  I was unfamiliar with David Thewlis, but he was awesome as well as Professor Lupin.  He managed to be weird and slightly menacing as well as a friendly mentor to Harry.  The film felt a bit 'rushed' as many points were left out (who, for example are Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail, and Prongs??...the only reason I know is that I read the book.  I wonder if those who haven't were completely lost...would it really have taken THAT long to explain who they were???)  Many of the scenes felt rushed and the dialog was a bit contrived to move the plot along.  I know this is often the nature of the translation of books to film; I don't think this film would have suffered had it been 30 minutes longer.  But don't get me wrong.  IT was a fine film and we all enjoyed it.  Yes, it's a bit darker than the others (I was SHOCKED to see many many toddlers in the audience!!  Hello, people??  What are you thinking????  Do you not read?  Every review I've seen warns against taking small children to this as it is quite scary.)  but older elementary kids and up will be fine, for the most part.",6,1,3,11 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Make it STOP!!
","I bought tickets to a Sundance screening of this movie, only to discover that its theatrical release was less than a week after the Sundance screening. I thought that at least the director would show up to the screening. Frankly, I probably wouldn't have chosen to see this movie had it not been at Sundance. I was horrified that some people actually bought young children (elementary age) to see this! Thankfully, after the first ten minutes and several disturbing images, they chose to leave. THIS is definitely not for children...Now to talk about the movie itself: I wanted all the horrible images to stop! How many awful things can happen to one person? After a while, I found myself laughing because this was such a ludicrous story. I think it was supposed to be suspenseful and horrible, but after a while it got so bad it was funny. Ashton Kutcher does a passable job, I suppose, but there were lots of things in the movie that I still didn't understand when it was over. For instance (SPOILER) what was with the grisly drawing the kid made in school? Did it have anything to do with anything? Or was it just his fantasy? I guess I really don't care, but it was just kind of left up in the air. Or perhaps I missed something. I cannot recommend this movie in good conscience. But I know there will be people who like this sort of thing. It was not for me. 1/10",1,7,22,22 January 2004
Moulin Rouge!," I paid money to see this??
","My husband and I and some friends rented this movie the other night, as none of us had seen it and we heard it had been nominated for an Academy Award. We kept waiting for the 'good part'...and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. I wish I'd had a camera to capture the 'HUH???' looks on all of our faces.
I read in another comment that people who didn't have a sense of humor wouldn't like this movie.  Let me tell you, we laughed.  A lot.  The inane use of cheesy song lyrics of the 70s made for loads of belly laughs because it was so HOKEY.  Other songs/lyrics incorporated into the dialog just made us shake our heads and roll our eyes.We came near to shutting off the movie several times as the gaudy, dizzying visuals made us sick.  We miraculously made it to the terrible ending of this movie (Spoiler alert) where we were shouting at Christian to go home and listen to his father...find a nice girl!!I guess this is the MTV version of the musical.  It made us want to go rent a real one, as this doesn't even deserve to be in the same genre as some of the truly great musicals of our time.If this piece of junk wins the Academy Award, I will not be surprised, but it will be a big disappointment, and further indication of how low we can sink if this crap is considered to be fine entertainment.I refuse to award this any stars.",1,1,6,24 February 2002
Garden State," Pretty good, with some reservations...
","I wanted to see this at Sundance, but it was hard to get in to see this one. So it's been about 8 months that I've waited to see it...I tried not to have too high expectations, because usually when I really think a movie's going to be great, it ends up letting me down.  I will say that I wasn't let down, and I enjoyed the story and the acting.  It was a little hard to take Zach Braff seriously as I love him in 'Scrubs'...but all I have to do is see his face and we start giggling.  Every once in a while in this film, I saw 'JD' instead of Large. But he did a great job in this film, as did Natalie Portman.  I don't want to go into too much detail, but I thought the movie was much too long. For example (POSSIBLE SPOILER) the party scene toward the beginning of the movie was a little too long and depressing.  I got RIGHT AWAY that Large (the main character) was detached and not feeling anything. I'm not sure why the extended 'drug use/spin the bottle/wild sex/anything goes' scene was needed...to me it just dragged.  As the movie progressed, it was interesting to watch Large become more and more aware, to 'wake up,' so to speak, yet I still found that many scenes were not necessary or could have been edited. (SPOILER AGAIN) Also, did we REALLY need to see the hooker sex scene?  I got the point when they showed the scumbags drooling as they watched through the peep holes. In all, this is worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of Braff...and Ms Portman. The love story of the movie is rather sweet.  I thought the title was clever, as well. Richard Roeper said that they had edited out about 15-20 minutes since he saw this at Sundance.  I wish they had cut about 20 minutes more...then it would have been great...as it is, it's a good effort.",6,3,6,27 August 2004
Shrek 2," A well done sequel
","As sequels go, this one is superior to most.  There were lots of laughs, new characters, and many clever jokes.  Good movie to enjoy as a family, but the sexual innuendo was definitely not necessary.  Surely they didn't have to have (SPOILER) Pinocchio wearing women's underwear!!  That was definitely TMI...and I didn't find it funny.  We all loved Antonio Banderas as 'Puss in Boots', and Eddie Murphy was still funny as Donkey.  Jennifer Saunders, Julie Andrews, John Cleese and Rupert Everett all turned in very funny performances.  This was a little too PC for my husband, but it was still enjoyable...a good way to spend an afternoon. The gross-out fart jokes, belching and the bugs are wearing thin, however.  I am thinking that Shrek and Shrek 2 are about as far as they need to go with this series. Dreamworks has another animated show coming out...I hope we have more original movies in store from them.",7,0,0,31 May 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Imaginative and Different
","There are a lot of good things about this version of Roald Dahl's classic. I loved the interaction between Charlie and his family. The scenes in the chocolate factory are imaginative and fun to watch. Loved the production numbers with the Oompa Loompas, but found myself wanting the words on the screen...there were times I couldn't understand them. The fates suffered by the nasty children are all fitting and fun to watch. In the 1971 version, we never saw what happened to the kids later, but they did show them leaving at the end of this one. That was a nice change, and funny.I think the movie would have been better had Wonka been made a little more likable and warm. He comes across and just a little too creepy to be likable. Having said that, there were several good laughs in this, and lots good special effects. You can certainly tell that Tim Burton directed this. It is indeed darkly funny, and some smaller children may be disturbed by this.",7,1,1,29 July 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mediocre film pulled up out of the doldrums by chemistry of Pitt and Jolie
","I am not a fan of either Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie. However, since this film got such good reviews, I decided to give it a chance. I found that the chemistry between the two leads made up for a multitude of sins, including numerous plot holes and some ridiculous situations. I did enjoy myself, and that's what movies are all about, isn't it? I will say that I found the violence to be excessive and a little monotonous. This could have been trimmed a bit (to maybe 100 minutes or so) and not have lost anything. I did enjoy the scene where the two leads stepped into the elevator (in the middle of the night) and 'Girl from Ipanema' was playing...LOL!! There are several other little jokes like this in the film.) This is a great summer movie...not much substance, just some fun.",7,0,1,23 August 2005
Love Actually," As good as I hoped!
","I'd seen the description of this movie about a year ago, I think, and couldn't wait until it came out! What a terrific cast...all of my favorites; Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman! The rest of the cast is quite strong, too. I was a bit worried that the cast was too large and that the stories would be hard to follow, but since most of the actors are quite well known, I didn't have any trouble at all. The story lines were smart and witty, touching held my interest! Hugh Grant is improving with age, too. There was a time that I would rather not see a movie with him in it, but he has redeemed himself in this movie as well as 'Bridget Jones' and 'About a Boy!' He was excellent in this, although his storyline was the most unbelievable, and his big speech made me roll my eyes, but I guess that's just the conservative in me. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, at any rate. My favorite of the stories was probably the one with Liam Neeson and the child who played his stepson. Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were absolutely brilliant, as usual.I will say that the nude scenes did make me a bit uncomfortable. (Probably this was because 3 older women behind me were screeching about how it 'ruined the whole movie'...yet they didn't get up and leave! hmmmm.) I almost wish those scenes had been left out of the movie as without them, it would be a fun movie that my daughters would like... I did appreciate the incongruity of the situation which has movie star stand-ins having simulated sex. The two of them are quite shy and reserved,just getting to know each other. Perhaps more creative people could have created another incongruous situation that would have been just as amusing and that would have made this a movie that young teens could enjoy as well. I don't think I'll let my 12 and 15 year old daughters see this for a few more years. It's too bad, because I thought the movie was well made and had some good messages. I plan to see this again with some friends soon. This was one definitely of my favorites this year. And looking ahead to coming attractions, it's likely to be one of the few romantic comedies coming out during November and December.",8,0,2,15 November 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Incoherent mess with a few little laughs
","I love dry humor. I'm a big fan of the Christopher Guest 'mockumentaries' and Monty Python films. I went to this movie with high expectations, given that BOTH Roger Ebert and Michael Medved (opposite ends of the political spectrum) gave it 3 of 4 stars. This movie started with a bang...I was laughing a lot at the opening; but then it just started to fizzle. So many of its jokes just do not work. The dog was cute, I suppose, but even that part of the story got to be just stupid at the end of the movie. SPOILER...and what the heck was the rumble scene about? The Monty Python-esquire chopping off limb scene didn't work all! What a waste of talent! And speaking of waste of talent...I kept waiting for Fred Willard to have a little screen time...and that's what he got; A LITTLE screen time. Too bad. The TV news industry is SUCH an easy target! There are lots of opportunities for smart and witty dialog. This movie digressed into banal sexual humor fairly early in the film and never dug itself out of that pit. 'Broadcast News' is a MUCH better film satire on the TV news industry. I came home after this mess and watched my BN DVD.",1,35,73,29 July 2004
Hitch," Much better than I thought it'd be
","I guess I need to stop reading reviews of rom-coms before I decide whether to see them. They are usually my favorite genre of movies, especially when I've had a tough week and I just want to relax and 'escape' for a couple of hours. Most critics panned this or gave it lukewarm reviews, but several friends of mine had seen it and told me they liked it, so I gave it a try. I am not a huge fan of Will Smith, but I think he did a great job in this movie. He was charming and funny, and he had good chemistry with Eva Mendes. However, the Kevin James/Amber Valletta couple absolutely stole the show. Kevin James has the best moments in the film and he always lit up the screen when he was on. I was also afraid that since I'd seen the trailer for this movie, I'd seen all the best jokes and there was no point (don't you hate when that happens?) but I was wrong. The laughs were evenly spaced with the dramatic moments, and I think men who usually run quickly in the other direction from chick flicks will enjoy this movie. Andy Tennant (director) did a marvelous job on this one. I recommend it.",7,0,0,19 March 2005
The Terminal," Well done; but a bit of fantasy
","I have to admit this story drew me in.  There is a lot about the movie that made me go, 'Wait a minute...' but all in all, it was a good story and I was able to overlook many of the sillier events.  Tom Hanks is so good that I kept forgetting that he's not really an Eastern European.  I had read that his accent left something to be desired...I don't agree.  I do that that Catherine Zeta-Jones had a distracting accent, however. Sometimes she sounded like she had a slight southern twang and other times that was absent. This was a largely character driven story, and I thought that all of the actors did a great job.  I cared about the airport employees--and Stanley Tucci had us laughing so hard at what a jerk he had to be.  I didn't find it slow at all...maybe just a bit more quiet.  It's not slapstick, although there's quite a bit of slipping and falling on a wet floor, if that's what makes you laugh (I have to admit I did laugh at the people falling down...).  Not the best movie I've ever seen, but not horrible as many reviews have complained.  I recommend this one to those who enjoy a good story.",7,1,2,23 July 2004
Rango," Dark, depressing, only mildly amusing
","First off, this is NOT a kid's movie and shouldn't be marketed as such. The showing I attended consisted of at least 50% children, and I heard no laughter from them. In fact, I am not sure WHO this is for because the first half of the film d r a a g g g e e e d on and on and on and by the time the action picked up, I really just wanted it to be over. Ugh. What a mess this was. I don't even know where to begin with the criticism.Let's see. First off, a line of dialog says that the setting is the 'Mojave Desert'. As a former (and hopefully future) resident of the Sonoran Desert (which is located in much of Southern Arizona and Mexico)I know for certain that Saguaro Cacti (the tall ones with the big arms) only grow in the Sonoran Desert. Fact check, anyone? Why not be true to your dialog? How hard would it have been to change that line to 'Sonoran'?? And another thing. What the HECK were those animals supposed to be? There was an extremely ugly flob nosed thing...(actually several of them) that was virtually unidentifiable. It had humanoid disgusting yellowed teeth and was difficult to look at. It seemed to me that the animators were trying to create the ugliest, scariest characters they could with no regard to any animal that exists in nature. The Sonoran Desert is FULL of fascinating creatures! Why not animate REAL animals. Study them (as the great animators do) and portray them with their real characteristics. Why on earth, for instance, would you have a venomous snake squeeze its prey? Most 5 year old boys know (and girls too, if they like snakes) that there are two kinds of snakes! Constrictors squeeze, venomous snakes bite! The dialog seems to be aimed at adults, and there were lots of references to pop culture movies (many of them, such as Brokeback Mountain were rated R!) that would just fly right over most kids' heads. My husband and I were bored silly during the first half. I must have checked my watch 5 or 6 times.Don't waste your money on this one. It's a dud.",3,2,6,29 March 2011
Music and Lyrics," I need to STOP listening to the male movie critics
","All of my favorite movie critics happen to be male. Most of the time, their opinions have kept me from wasting my time at stinkeroo movies. I don't relish the idea of spending money and time at a movie that I won't enjoy. However. The critics were almost universally wrong about this one. While Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore don't have a lot of chemistry, they make up for it in their acting and comedic timing. This is particularly true of Grant. I found myself laughing aloud several times during this movie. While this isn't the kind of movie that leaves you sighing about the romance, it was a lot of fun and very cute. I loved the 80s pop references, and Hugh Grant is very believable as a washed up 80s icon. I will most likely be buying this one when it comes out on DVD, if only to see Hugh shaking his hips again! Haha. I can see why a lot of men wouldn't necessarily like it...but then again, those who were in high school during the 80s during that awful time for pop music (hahaha...is there ever a GOOD time for pop music? LOL!!!) might enjoy the trip down memory lane. I liked this one!",7,2,4,24 February 2007
The Queen," Interesting account of one week
","in the life of the rulers of Britain, and the prime minister. Where do I start? I was so thankful to FINALLY have a movie worth seeing (even though I had to drive to Salt Lake City, 30 miles away, to see it, since either the movie theater owners up here in Hicksville, er, Ogden, don't think we will understand it, or legitimately, there just isn't the audience up here.) (It's one of my pet peeves that the only movies we're offered up here are blockbuster crowd-pleaser type, wide audience movies, without ONE TEENY little screen being offered for those of us who would rather see something with a little more substance). THis movie opened yesterday (Friday afternoon) in Salt Lake City, and I attended the 2:30 show. I was pleased that there was actually a LINE that I had to wait in! The theater wasn't chock full, but then, it was mid afternoon, when it's usually pretty quiet.What a treat this was! I am old enough to remember when Charles was the eligible bachelor looking for a bride, and I have to admit (with a red face) that I joined in the crowds watching the big wedding in 1981. I am one year older than Diana was, so in that aspect, I could relate to her. By 1997, however, Charles and Diana had divorced, and the public had, for the most part, sided with Diana, who was seen as more caring than the rest of the royal family. Her private side was never seen by us, a point made brilliantly in this film. I remember when Diana died, there were people who were decrying that she had died when she had finally found 'true love' (sorry, but I sincerely DOUBT IT). Anyway, 'THe Queen' is a study of the old monarchy trying to come to grips with the changing world (or should I say 'changed').Helen Mirren is nothing short of brilliant. She absolutely disappeared into the character of QEII, so effectively that I forgot at times that I was watching a movie, and started to believe that she was actually Elizabeth II. I have to admit that I know next to nothing about royal protocol, and it was quite interesting to hear about it through this film. Michael Sheen was also brilliant as Tony Blair, as was James Cromwell as Prince Phillip. This movie probably has the best ensemble cast of any film I've seen this year. The last movie I saw that I enjoyed this much was 'Little Miss Sunshine,' another movie with a fine ensemble cast. I am hoping that since the holidays are approaching, there will be more choices out there for we moviegoers who want something a little more thoughtful than the usual fare. Thanks to the filmmakers for a fine experience.",10,1,2,4 November 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Classic Comedy that stays fresh
","There are two kinds of people:  those who think MP&THG is hilarious, and those who don't get it.  My daughters and I love this movie...my husband thinks its just too silly.  Which is the entire point!!  Yes, it's silly. But it's also the most quotable movie I've ever seen.  We watch it regularly and laugh our heads off.  The DVD is particularly well done, with TWO commentary tracks and lots and lots of fun extras.  Right now we're watching the Japanese translation.  The subtitles are a HOOT. It's also fun to watch the ENGLISH subtitles.  Now I know the words to 'We're Knights Of the Round Table.'  LOL!  Also, the 'sing along with the monks' feature is rather funny!!  You must sit and listen to the audio on it (if striking yourself on the head with your DVD box didn't hurt, you're not doing it hard enough!!)If you're one of the few who haven't seen this, you should watch it with someone who finds it funny.  It's much more fun to watch this in a crowd. It is heartening to me that my daughter, who is in high school, and her friends think this movie is as hilarious as I did when I first saw it in the 70s.",10,1,2,5 June 2004
The Ugly Truth," Not wonderful, but not totally horrible, either.
","After listening to and reading many, many negative reviews from (of course) male movie critics, my expectations for this film were extremely low. The same critics who loved Borat and Knocked Up and Superbad are now complaining that THIS movie is 'too crude'. Since no one brought excrement to a dinner table in THIS film, I am thinking that this one isn't nearly as disgusting (or mean!!) as Borat (which I will admit I haven't seen...after hearing about that scene, I didn't want to). But I digress. The other reviewer who mentioned that certain critics just can't handle mixed genre films must be right...my view is that it's okay (to the male critics) for 'guy' movies, or movies sold as straight comedies (The Wedding Crashers comes to mind) to have crude language, but if a 'chick flick' has bad language, then it's disgusting. I don't get it. I DID think much of the dialog in this movie was unnecessarily crude. However, I didn't think it was the worst film I've ever seen. I do think I enjoyed it more than 'The Proposal'. I am a fan of Katherine Heigl (I loved 27 Dresses), and Gerard Butler. Another wee criticism I have for this movie is that I just don't understand why they felt the need to HIDE Butler's accent. Why not just let him be Scottish? It was distracting to hear him slip into his natural dialect. I found myself wishing they'd just had him speak in his normal voice. I also enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would.",5,1,7,2 August 2009
The Island," Good blend psychological drama and action
","I really did enjoy myself at this movie. The first half, especially, was intriguing. I already knew the premise of the film, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the plot as it unrolled bit by bit. I have to admire Ewan MacGregor's wise decision to affect an American accent for the scenes where he played 'the clone' (Lincoln 6 Echo)...and later, when his 'sponsor' (Tom Lincoln) is introduced, he uses his own Scottish accent. The CGI was used well in the scenes where MacGregor acted with himself. The plot was well written so that it was hard to predict where it was going, especially during the first 3/4 of the movie. The last half of the film turned into an action film, and for my taste, there was a bit TOO much action. I know that I am in the minority on this, but I don't like it when there are so many explosions one after the other; after a while I just get numb to it, and it gets to be monotonous. But that's really a minor complaint. The movie was entertaining from beginning to end, and the acting by MacGregor and Scarlett Johanson was excellent.",7,0,0,20 August 2005
