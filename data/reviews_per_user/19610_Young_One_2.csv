The Blair Witch Project," Not even worth a rental
","I hired The Blair Witch Project from my local Blockbuster expecting a scary movie, it was not. The movie wasn't scary and not enough depth was gone into the story. Basically the whole film just shows scenes with the three teenages hiking through the forest, looking for answers about the Blair Witch. It was over all too soon and there was only maybe one scene that made you twitch a little and I mean twitch, not a jump but a twitch.Overall I didn't enjoy the film all that much, even with the DVD version and all the added features, I felt robbed of a good watch. All I asked from the film was a decent storyline and at least tell us more about the 'Blair Witch' however all we discovered in the course of the film was that the teenages were great at getting lost, hardly anything was known about the 'Blair Witch', we didn't even get to know the characters. The angles of the camera were well done and even though it did make me a little queesy I must say that it was perfect for the film but even the great camera angle isn't enough to save this film. So if you want a scary movie, look else where and only watch this film if you must have to.",3,0,1,12 January 2001
The Matrix," No doubt the best Sci-Fi of the decade.
","The Matrix is an excellent movie. What makes it an excellent movie? It's excellent and original story line, it's excellent ground-breaking special effects and it's excellent cast. It's a must see for all sci-fi fans and even if your not a sci-fi, it's still a great watch.What is The Matrix? It's story is set in around the year 2199, where computers/machine/AI have enslaved the entire human race and are using us as a power sorce for them. The AI (Artificial Intelligence) have plugged all humans into a somewhat Virtual Reality computer program (The Matrix) where we live our life in the year 1999 unaware of the real world.Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) leads a team of would-be heros to find The Chosen One, who is capable of changing The Matrix to his liking. Keanu Reeves plays Neo, The Chosen One, who with the help of Morpheus and his team try to save the world.I won't reveal too much of the story for you but it's a great movie that all must watch. Two sequels are planned with The Matrix 2 being planned for a 2002 release and The Matrix 3 for a 2003 release. Let's see if it can life up to the first one.",10,0,1,4 January 2001
