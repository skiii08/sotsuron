It," Started well.......didn't float
","Pennywise is portrayed fairly well except for the overuse of CGI effects which robbed the tension from many scenes just to add cheap scares.Poor bonding in the losers club, they all seem to get on each others nerves. Nothing like the book.
Poor story and character development, it slumbers from one set piece to the next.
Sloppy editing, lacks cohesion.
Too much foul language, when will script writers learn that its not edgy, just grating.
Little to no back story. Some scenes and relationships just hang there unexplained.
Gratuitous jump scenes offer nothing if you're over 15.
Moving the film from the 50's to the 80's didn't work very well.
Many missing scenes that made the book and original film endearing.
Some fight scenes defy physics....and biology, kids don't get punched 20 feet through the air, hit a wall and jump up like nothings happened.
I wanted to like this, sadly I didn't really.",3,3,4,20 September 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," 2 hours of the same thing
","So basically Tom Hardy plays a very flat uncharismatic Max helping Furiosa and some ladies escape toxic masculinity and the patriarchal society. We have many chases and fights with some variable quality CGI getting there then.........they turn round and go back.
Laws of physics seem to be ignored and there are more firearms and ammunition than you can shake a stick at.
So in essence, that's the film. Spectacular,silly, boring and cliched all in one.",3,4,6,10 November 2019
