The Avengers," Avengers is a great popcorn flick.
","I must Marvel the way the movie has been received worldwide, our poor cousins in the US get to see it a week later.. feels good for a change.Coming to the movie, A wonderful ensemble of superheros out to save the world from a maverick God who is on the hunt for a certain cube with infinite energy source to make weapons of mass destruction with which he will provide humans freedom from freedom. Seems quite a mouthful that.A gunfire underwhelming start with Loki the God escaping with the Cube quite callously provides us with the excuse to get the Avenger cast together. And so follows the tryst with good vs evil. As one scene follows the other in mundane logical sequence, The super heroes flaunt their wares with aplomb. Wit and humor coinciding with every innuendo in the action sequences. Robots mechanical serpents and the Incredible Hulk!A fun and thrill spectacle in spectacular 3D. Wow the popcorn felt great too.",6,6,23,29 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," I tell you this movie is very boring
","Hello my brothers and sisters of planet earth, it is with great anticipation i went to see this movie . With the Amazing title I thought it must be at least 10 times better than the last Spiderman.But lo and behold what do we have here? Same old wine in a new bottle. And that is not all. Spiderman actually made me yawn! Can you believe that? I mean, Spidey making me yawn! O God I wish the time had stopped at that moment and i could turn back the clock to the time when i was about to buy the tickets and my friend was begging me to save our hard earned savings for Batman.TSo i am now in need of a loan to watch Batman and also for some therapy. Help.I Yawned in a Spiderman movie OMG????????",3,5,12,6 July 2012
