Hereditary," Snowflakes that think being 'unfriended' is horror won't understand this one.
","A slow build to a great finish.As others have commented, finally something fresh from an industry mostly bankrupt of new ideas, and depending on too many remakes and reboots lately.",8,0,2,27 August 2018
Aquaman," Leaps beyond the hype of Black Panther!
","No social issues central to the plot, no political agendas, no identity politics, no special interest groups catered to.Just entertainment!There may still be hope left, for entertainment coming out of Hollywood...!",8,0,3,25 March 2019
Ready Player One," Barely recognisable to the book. Should have been called, 'Ready Player Four'
","I read the book twice before watching the movie, now I'll read it again to remind me of its awesomeness. The heart of the book was clues and problem solving by awesome Parzival, the movie had relatively none. Parzival was just one of the cast in the move.Spielberg should have made this into three parts, to involve the audience in that respect - this movie was cool cgi, nothing else. Story was really absent. To the audience that gave this movie 10 or 9 stars - read the book to see what you're missing! The book rating is off the charts!Cline is talking about a sequel book - Please don't make another disappointing movie about it!",7,0,4,19 June 2018
Bird Box," Two five-year-olds, and she still calls them 'boy' and 'girl'?!
","Then, when she reaches safety, she proudly proclaims herself as their 'mother'......what a bi+ch!",2,1,10,27 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Half this movie is boring, emotional dialogue, unlike the first part all action!
","I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute of it was accounted for with importance to the plot - not wasted on snowflake emotions.This second half has an excellent plot, but oh, my - how it dragged on with talk and tears!I also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.Several other points of disappointment, too.Bummer.",1,120,204,1 August 2019
Wonder Woman," DC universe movies have the worst directors! We are in Bizarro world!
","Patty Jenkins is a terrible director for action/comic movies, and I see she's signed for the next Wonder Woman movie, too! (Doomed!)Zack Snyder hasn't been a good director on anything since Sucker Punch (2011) in my opinion, and he's signed for several more DC world movies coming up! (Doomed!) DC universe should be the pinnacle of comic heroes - they have the best, yet they continue to swirl the toilet...*We are in Bizarro world!*",3,3,11,20 February 2018
Annihilation," Low Reviews here exposes the extent of pseudo sci fi aficionados
","The low-star reviews shows how many people either have no imagination, no basic science intelligence, and/or just too damn dense to understand a good, rudimentary sci fi movie like this one.If you really 'get' sci fi, you will enjoy this one.
Panspermia is the plot drive, and although slower paced than an eye candy movie like Star Wars, it still captivates.My only criticism is the title. 'Annihilation' implies everything gets destroyed, when it doesn't - 'morphing' is what happens.",8,10,25,17 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," I will watch Alien and Aliens again now for Recovery.
","Spoilers! Does R. Scott predict that in the future our planet scanning from space will be non-existent? Why didn't they orbit the planet a few times before putting on the brakes and making a bee-line to the surface right away?! Then they would have seen impressive cities everywhere made by these incredibly advanced civilisation...abandoned! A scan would have shown *danger! no life signs!*, and they could have continued on their way. How about sending a few rovers to look for clues? It seems that the aliens have devolved, too, as they allowed a space craft return to their planet (through what should have been an impressive planetary defense system)unchallenged, and let them approach the surface. Also, I'd think some alien somewhere in an enclosed area just by chance would have been able to alert the rest of the planet about the attack, and to get advanced weapons and armour out of storage.Yes, I will now watch the first and second Alien movies again to revive my enjoyment of a great sci fi concept.",3,5,8,2 August 2017
The Martian," Read the book - this movie is garbage compared.
","The book is all about clever science, the movie has hijacked it and made it a bravado propaganda monster for a country that can't even get astronauts into orbit, anymore!They should have just stuck to the book.",2,0,3,13 May 2018
