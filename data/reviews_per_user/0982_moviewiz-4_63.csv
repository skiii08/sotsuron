The Rock," Good action movie
","I've seen this couple of times before writing the review.
The story of courage and justice which the plots of these movie that make it very powerful action movie to watch. Sean and Nicolas acting are very imaginative and true as when seen from their previous movies. Only this part, Sean's character is a low profile person who enjoy action as much as the other characters from the movie, it is much more different from his previous movie.I can say the plot is absolutely brilliant.",8,3,3,21 October 2000
Mission: Impossible III," Expect the worst mission, ever
","When this movie entered the cinema i thought this might be another great serial of the impossible movie but i was wrong. Ten days later, my wife and i both went to the cinema to see this baby because of public holiday over here in this country.First, the scene at Ethan's house. I mean you shouldn't have that, why? because it is a waste of time. We are talking about action movie and not drama. Then at the beginning of the story i wonder why nowadays film always like to have the 'flashback' scene. It is like an uneducated movie maker that already lost of idea. Get some hints for people around the world so you know what story is the best for mission impossible.Talking about the characters. Except Mr. Tom Cruise himself, the rest have pathetic acting skills especially the Chinese character. I mean no harm but myself is Chinese and why she speaks English not mandarin? Let Ethan and the rest of the team talk to her with mandarin. Isn't that more fun? (I thought spy can understand and speak many languages. MI3 spies can speak Italian and some European languages and it is so strange that they can't speak Mandarin which is widely spoken around the world, i think it the second beside English, this story is weak from this point of view) I still enjoy the first installment from Mr. Brian DePalma. Maybe like some other people say, as you grow older....you gain experience and you get the worse director ever to handle this part. The television serials are even more exciting that this one.",7,0,0,14 May 2006
Erin Brockovich," Very amazing movie
","I got this movie on DVD instead of going to the cinema. After reading review and watch it for myself, i can say this is an amazing movie with a good plot on it.Julia gives brilliant performance as Erin Brockovich, someone who take down a company because of its mistake.Also, something to admire is the dress that Julia wear is simple marvelous.",8,1,1,8 September 2000
Meet the Parents," Good comedy, like it very much
","Don't have a chance to see it at the cinema, then get it at home video. This movie is one of the most enjoyable and comical comedy i have ever seen. The story is excellent, goes as plan and the casts are well picked too. They all act perfectly.Haven't seen much of Mr DeNiro movie on comedy, he obviously did a very good job in this one, like him much in his character.The part in the airport is also one of the best. The acts seem pure and original.Worth it and excellent movie, well done.",9,0,0,21 March 2001
Se7en," Not bad
","Not bad for a psychological thriller but the story doesn't show it inner strength, which is cruelty.Although the movie is about murder by the seven deadly sins, it doesn't attract enough attention from the audience, just like a common drama movie not a psycho movie.The best performance from Brad and Morgan from one of their earliest movie.",7,1,4,4 November 2000
Unbreakable," Not very good
",After watching the sixth sense and this one. Unbreakable is not that promising story. The plot is a bit empty and the ending is not very good indeed.This part is a bit disappointing but worth watching.,7,0,0,12 December 2000
Memento," Good? I don't think so
","Good? I believe this story is good but how can a film maker get the idea of making the story backwards? It simple ridiculous. The plot follow through the story well but this movie will only suitable for expert users, someone who hold at least a bachelor degree to understand this movie well, otherwise, people might think it is a magic or fantasy movie.Also, the ending... what happened next? the screen just turn black and end title rolling. So... at least a last intro should be written. Anyway, enjoyable movie.",6,3,5,23 May 2001
Captain Marvel," Bad...bad and bad...
","What I enjoyed from this film are:
1. Camera angle. So smooth and not shaky.
2. Effect..last 10 minutes
3. Story..last 10 minutesYour story is too complicated to understand. Make a simple one, we want action not a psychological thriller.",5,169,404,6 March 2019
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Excellent children and adult movie
","The title is kind of weird, sounds like a name somewhere at the Andes mountain or in the city of Papua but 'Narnia' is amazing.Andy hasn't read the book yet and what he can tell from this movie is that the story is wonderful and the fighting scene is a thumb up, the scenery, the people,costumes and special effects.Andy can't probably write more only a little bit of comment for the snow that all completely too bright and my eyes have to be winked for a while before continuing its journey. The songs.. well not too bad, music is fine, the 'rush-hour' at the field is well choreograph and.. well, kind of difficult to explain to the audience of what i think and feel.",9,0,1,16 January 2006
Us," Original, somehow complicated.
","It is creative, original and entertaining. There are some movies that have similar plot too but this one is different and better than the others. My comments (can be made better)
1. Camera movement is simply too fast.
2. The speedboat scene was too dark, couldn't see what happened.
3. Many scenes are too dark.",8,10,34,20 March 2019
Orphan," Child with bad attitude
","This movie is amazing. Beside the story is interesting, the casts have play very well in the story.Esther's character is the best as i can see. She can manage her personality, attitude and almost everything that she needs to do. I give this actress a 9/10 acting performance although she is only 12 years old.Some flaws can be seen in the story. Esther character at the end of the movie doesn't look like kid anymore, more like an adult. The house scene is too dark and the camera changes constantly and rapidly, so it is hard to see what is going on.",9,2,3,31 December 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," Nothing special, not too good.
","Although i've seen a lot of disasters movie but to tell you the truth, this is obviously the same with the other hollywood's tragic movies.This film shows good audiences outcome and people queueing up to take a look of it, unfortunately i didn't get a chance to get the ticket on that day, disgusted, i found another way to locate the movie and i get it, after meticulously search for it.What is amazing in this movie are the ice, the tanker, to my surprised how can a ship that huge can enter the city without even destroying the whole building blocks and the ship just looks intached.",8,0,0,7 June 2004
X-Men," The Mutants
","Not a very bad movie, for Marvel at least it worth to be produced. Good action sequence, good story line, but something is missing. The special effects is totally awful, not to the plan and not resemble the one in the comic book or games. More spending in effects should be an advantage and probably will get more audience. If sequel will be produce, more characters should be added like Gambit or War Machine.I give it 7/10 to x-men. If the movie can show something like 'Future Cops'(HK version of Street Fighter released in 1993)then X-men will deserved 10/10",7,0,0,16 August 2000
Spider-Man 3," Too long and melancholy story
","When this movie premiere in Asia, i have a chance to give it a go, to see how the third installment of this movie can give the audience. So, my wife and i went to the cinema, saw the long queue and the audience's excitement of wanting to be the first to see spider-man 3.Popping into the cinema and bought a coke i began to observe the screen seriously. First part of the movie is good and one hour later it getting bored and tremendously makes me want to sleep. There are too many unwanted dialog. Spiderman should be an action movie and we need something more, which is 'Action'.Seeing the stars began to weep now that must be deleted. I believe the producers rush to make this movie and it turns out the plot is bad and we don't see anything good on it. The story is simply too long.The cameraman probably need to learn how to handle the camera. When the scene where 'the sandman' begin to create havoc, the camera move too fast, it makes us dizzy.Anyway, for entertainment, i give spider-man 3 a pass mark.",6,1,2,9 May 2007
The Terminator," Okay but not a pleasant one
","This movie is not as good compare to the second series. Maybe because of the effects and music which are not up to the standard, very dull. Some of the story in this movie is out of the point, irrelevant. At first it is ok but finally it become quite hard to understand.The action is ok. Too bad Arnold doesn't speak much in this movie, only when his character is able to change the voice. The T2 movie probably do not relate to the first part in some way.",7,1,2,16 March 2001
Final Destination 2," Too Much Violence
",Very cruel and scary when i saw this movie. At first the story seems okay but when it goes on it getting better and better.The story sometimes complicated but enjoying the violence was part of it. The new stars have the same capability of putting this movie into good line and smoothly delivered the final ending.Where are the people from sounds effect department? This movie lack of it.,7,0,0,10 February 2003
Cast Away," Not bad but can be better
","The movie itself is good, story is excellent the thing is that there are lots of movies that shown someone or somebody stranded on an island.Some movie critics might not find this interesting cause even myself have seen lots of movie which similar like this. The only thumb up is the story which can be say, excellent writing.",8,0,0,18 January 2001
Armageddon," Good and brilliant, like it
","Probably one of the best action movies i have seen. The effects are wonderful and the story is excellent.All of the film characteristics are there, the music, story and effects.",9,2,3,19 March 2001
American Psycho," The film with no ending
","I think this film is a bit funny, there are supposed an ending to this and there is no clear explanations of how the person he though had die reappeared, who did it? A very good suspense but lack of strong support for the story.",6,0,1,6 September 2000
North by Northwest," excellent and brilliant
","Don't like old movie myself. After seeing Hitchcock's Psycho, i decided to see this movie myself. What make a good movie is the ability to make the audience feel that they are on it. For this one, i hardly ever move from my chair. Quite a long movie but it worth watching.",8,0,1,18 January 2001
Knowing," Superb movie but can be better
","Although Nicolas Cage is looking old but he is still the man to act in this movie.Let me get straight to the point. First, the story is interesting. Students draw a picture and put it in a seal envelope, how the school bury the time capsule into a big hole in front of the school gate. Apparently, from the scene the movie changes to horror (the kid scratching the door with her fingernail) and change then change to science fiction (UFO).I do not know what should i called this movie, horror, drama or science fiction? Overall, the movie still worth for us to go and see. That's all",7,1,3,27 June 2009
Doctor Zhivago," Like this one
","Nice movie, the background and theme song are excellent. The story of love,war and betrayal. Although the movie did not have much sound or music to accompany the background as it goes but the plot has been well written and the most interesting part is to see all the beautiful settings.I do not really fancy classic movie unless it has a great story. This one indeed has all of it and believe it or not, when the story begin, the beauty of the story is already on it.",8,0,0,12 March 2001
"I, Robot"," amazing and interesting
","I am not a fan of Isaac Asimov but i know that he created many exciting sci-fi book so i went to the cinema to see one of his latest, I,Robot.What make me surprise is that the scene where 1000 robots line up together and they all look real, thumb up to effects' team. The story, to tell you the truth, they are rather similar to other fantasy movie such as 'Bicentennial Man', so not much different.Why don't the producer show the audience more on how the future looks like in 2035 from items to foods, maybe. The old sci-fi movies could have done better than this.",7,0,0,10 August 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," This one is better
","Like this one compare to the first one. The effects are excellent and the story is good too. Although i can't see any special items on the DVD version, it is still one of the most enjoyable movie to be seen.The movie shown too many of its weaknesses. Some small mistakes are highly viewable from the entire movie.Anyway, totally great.",7,0,0,17 April 2001
Spider-Man," Good one
","This is one of the best Marvel based comic book bring back to the big screen. The story is good and the effects are very amazing. Also, like the humour as well.Keep it up and can wait to see the second installment.",9,0,0,27 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Ok but too similar!
","This war epic is fine, they are make very beautifully. Too bad is that the story has similar characteristics with 'Titanic', about human suffering. Although the story is a bit too long but it can be promising with bunch of huge big names Hollywood star.I believe the story has to be explain with more details and that's maybe can make this film an enjoyable one to watch.",5,0,0,14 July 2001
Resident Evil," This movie not really has the same characteristics with the game itself
","The movie is good and the some of the plot is well written. The fact is that only 10% of the story itself match the game. The sound and music don't even correct and this doesn't give the audience an eerie feeling of being in the movie.The effects are good, especially at the part when the laser beam starting to move, down and up or in the middle, now, that's something. Other than that, the story has same introduction and ending with the past zombie movie.By the way, where is the puzzle, doors, small and smelly hallway, zombie lying around or grenade launcher, ammo. It is advisable to have all that stuff in this movie, then RE can be graded as class A pictures.",7,0,1,29 March 2002
Avengers: Endgame," Great and amazing but....
","The fans of Marvel's fan in my country is amazing. We are treated a 24 hours round the clock screening but there are several improvements that can be made. I will write less spoiler but still include a spoiler warning.First, camera angles, some are too confusing and complicated. Make it still?
Second, a good idea to have a flashback(even a minor one) showing how the outcome of an event occured.
Third, don't show the place that simply too dark, we don't know who hit who vice versa.The best part? The battle and the appearance of the female's saviour (you know who)",9,1,4,25 April 2019
Independence Day," Good.. excellent
","This is one of the movie that i seen the most times. Beside good special effects, theme and storyline, all the characters are great. By chance, i enjoyed the DVD special edition and seeing the uncut version.Something that would like to comment is the wire which hooked to the actors. During the blow up scene, i can see clearly some of the extra being blown away and when they fly, their stomach is bending a bit and show very clearly they are wired. Other than that, all the scene are superb.Brilliant and well done.",8,0,2,8 April 2001
Gone with the Wind," Beautifully done
","It seems this movie's script is so excellent i keep watching it from the beginning to the end and try to memorise some of it and hope i can used it to someone. It is really amazing.The most original ideas, since it was make in the 30's i can say the story is excellent and good. One thing to comment is the effect, the background clearly shown it is a add on graphics or pictures. Other than that, brilliant performance by the casts especially Ms Leigh, she is so good in this movie, her emotion and attitude. Good character and acting.",9,0,0,22 May 2001
Wreck-It Ralph," One of the greatest animated movie
","I haven't seen any cartoon or animated movie for around 2 years until this one comes out at HBO. This is simply the most amazing movie and the story is very promising. I like the story, characters and how beautiful the scenes are.Some room of improvements. The story can focuses more on other games, for examples: pacman, street fighter and maybe others minor game such as dig dug. The details on other games are not fully revealed. Maybe that can be improved by making the shot to some other games characters and their environments.One of the cartoon that can make me laugh and shed some tears. Good job.",9,1,2,1 September 2013
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Can be better
","As i seen the second part on the DVD, i noticed the second one still lacks of story. The jungle scene is too long and the city scene is too short.The first episode is still better, actors performed better. The lost world have two scene which are not accurate. The scene where Julianne supposed to duck down when the big dinosaur attack her. She did it too fast because from the movement, the scene just not match. The second part is when the man in the jungle supposed to be attacked by jumping creature, but he scream before the raptor jump over him, a delay of approx 5 seconds.Overall, the performance is average. Can't wait for the third episode to appear.",7,0,0,13 October 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The journey of swordsman
","Amazing ancient chinese story of loyalty, love and revenge. Chow Yun Fatt play as a legendary swordsman who would like to quit the martial world. After one of his personal and most dangerous property being story, there are more then hidden mystery between the people he knows.Seen this movie in cantanose language in Malaysia. i can see from the mouth movement and it definitely a language replacement from Mandarin to Cantonese. Some of the language spoken is not accurate translated. Lucky i follow the subtitle.A very well written story. There is part which i find it too long, the part when the girl tell her story how she met her lover at the desert. This can be cut and make way to more appropriate story.",9,0,0,3 August 2000
2012," The same story hits twice
","I don't really think this movie is good enough. I have seen a lot of movies since i was 10 years old. For almost 20 years movie is just like my favourite toy and for '2012' i give it a 4 out of 10, why? Let's spot through the weaknesses. First, it is the same director doing the same theme, three times if i am not mistaken, three. Secondly, the story is rather dull, no emotional touch and the actors and actresses couldn't cry, what they can do is just showing a 'fake' sadness on screen. Thirdly, the effects are ordinary, i mean, why don't you show a city underwater? or corpses? or maybe an afterlife? Last, two and the half hours, lots of dialogue, this is not a movie based on book or literature, we are not talking about Shakespeare.Director, if you want to make better movie with better plot, come and see me and i will give you a little hints.Seeing almost 1000000 movies since 1985.",4,5,10,20 November 2009
Ghost Rider," Good effects with low story line
","We have seen the movie and now it is the time for us to write the review on 'Ghost Rider' First, i was very excited. I though when i glanced through the preview and observe how they create the skeleton-on-fire effect, that's really cool but..... the story didn't even have any adrenalin to be pumped, just like another action movie,worse, completely dull and empty.To tell you the truth, what i like or maybe the audience like from this movie was the sequence where Mr Nicolas Cage transformed his head to a skeleton, and that's really neat.Secondly, the plot is slightly weak and the characters are not up to date. It means that they are not properly introduced by the scriptwriter and we only know the characters from his name. I mean you should be able to let your audience know your characters without mentioning his/her name and that's what i called a 'Story' Last, people create movie to entertain people. Some audience do not like to think much so you must be able to give what the audience want without involving them to think. 'Ghost Rider' does not have that. Besides the strange characters name and also the improper beginning of the movie.I hope Marvel can create more exciting story for all generations, can't wait for the next fantastic four movie.",7,2,4,13 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," The best x-men ever
","The final serial of x-men. It is better, more effects, better characters and plot with the sense of humour.Approaching the cinema i noticed the queue to the counter. Most people would like to see x-men, yes, x-men. It is comic book based movie that storm to the cinema couple of years ago. Although i have seen the first and the second parts, i can say this is the best one. Why? When i was a growing adult, five years back. I played this call x-men game and i am amazed that what these characters can do. And.. five years later i soon discovered that technical effects and movie studio can produce such a great visual effects. Really amazing.The movie. well, it is fun, many characters resemble the one in the game especially juggernaut(he is not big enough) and also colossus. By the way, where is gambit? Maybe the producer can waste dozen of poker card for him just to throw it to the enemy.Good work for the director, special effects team, the story writer and the costume designer. hope there is the 4th x-men with more characters and longer story. By the way , this 'last stand' is too short indeed.",9,0,3,29 May 2006
A Quiet Place," Clever and creative film.
","This is simply an amazing movie. Clever plot and satisfying. 
Creatures that haunt from sound. One point from the story which
simply doesn't make any sense is: you have a shotgun with
ammo which is ready to be used, why bother to hide again?
Some aspects from the story are not fully explain. Those
who are not clever enough to catch what ia going on,
will find it hard to understand the meaning of it.",8,6,14,3 April 2018
Mission: Impossible II," The Mission that is impossible
","This sequel is not as good as the first one. If it is not because of the action-pack, it probably the most boring Mission Impossible sequel i have ever seen since the television series in the 80's. I still salute the story in the 80's starring Peter Graves as the IMF team. The plot is not that well written but the story goes as time pass-by. Newton give a brilliant performance as a thief and thanks to John Woo, the movie is an excellent view for action people out there.",6,0,0,21 June 2000
Hotel Mumbai," Error, wrong location.
","If you are going to make an action movie not based on a true story, then , this is a must watch film. Considering yourself as the victims, or people that live in that area or people who has strong religious belief, the film directly aim to them. Those individuals would probably don't like it and can rebel or revolt in anyways they like. Lastly, the market for this film is more suitable for western market like America or Europe.",2,60,117,28 October 2019
The Mummy Returns," Ok! Yes!
","Quite a fantastic sequel especially the coming back of all the original stars in this seconds installment of 'The Mummy'The most amazing scene is the the battle between two different tribes and involved huge numbers of people. I think it might have thousands but if it is true people or just computer graphics, that can't be sure enough but it is very impressive.Something to comment about is the sad scene. The actors expression are too poor and not good enough. It should be done better to make this movie more perfect.For effects, again, very impressive and excellent job of creating the fast action scene from time to time.The camera angle move a bit too fast. Cause a bit of headache especially in the fighting scene. It probably good to stay in one angle for at least 10 seconds before moving to another angle. I don't even know who fight who, it is allright for the one to one but for the whole bunch of people, that simply not good enough.Overall, entertaining, funny and very original ideas.",7,0,0,20 June 2001
Toy Story 2," Fine details story

Saw," Very good
","Kind of a good story. Beside it is very scary, sometimes we see what happen to the victims when they failed to fulfill their task. I though only certain parts of the movie are good but i am wrong.The weird things about this is that why the backgrounds are so dark and there is hardly any light at all? The director should give some part of the scene to be bright, at least an artificial light if you can't supply sunlight on it.I did not see the final part cause when i saw this movie on DVD it was a bit late and i was kind of sleepy at that time but maybe i saw darkness all the time and it makes me want to go to bed.",7,0,1,28 November 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Is it worth it??
","I don't see any interesting in this story. Simply too much violence and the background music accompany the movie all way make this looks like a cult, drug-used story telling.It seems that the movie can be done better with no background music which are too low and not alive. The story of the man when he turned into a new leaf doesn't tell the plot in more details. The final part is very rare, hard to understand and no suitable ending.",5,2,8,10 November 2000
The Descent," Terrible movie, very dark and can't see anything
","Everybody said that this movie is good but when i glanced at it, kind of disgusting and the story is very dull. I though at first i did enjoyed it but actually not at all.At first, it is rather interesting. When the girls entered the cave and things started getting weary and the only items that can i can see is the stars themselves and not the props.I rather see some other movies that have the real 'horror' genre. This one is real bad.The casts act perfectly, only the story is very boring. The lighting, creatures and the location are all bad.",5,0,2,10 March 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," Beautiful movie
","What's a story, the screenplay is very good and the story is perfectly done.
Although it is black and white, it is the most wonderful movie beside 'Psycho(60's)'. The beginning and the ending match perfectly. Also, it is quite a memorable to show audience from the movie that life is precious and should be treasure.Too bad it is B&W and it is good if the movie can be in colour, probably a nice one will be.",9,1,5,28 April 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Like this one much
","A comprising enjoyable story about a story of a living legend. Pretty simple that i don't have an idea of whose this person is and until i saw the whole story i can say it is extremely good.Some of the plots are rather complicated. For instance when the scene where the leading cast enter the room. The first that comes to the audience mind was, is he a student or a teacher or just a guest lecturer, etc.The way it ends, well, excellent one.",8,0,2,6 March 2002
Psycho," Interesting and Scary
","I do not enjoy seeing black and white movie, by chance my cable tv shown this movie couple of years ago then i decided to watch it.I do not really know what this movie is all about until i see the part where Bates talking to his mother and i assumed the person is really his mother. A rather strange and make me guessing as the shower scene come out and the famous tune 'ing ing ing ing, deng deng...' It makes glue to my sit and watch the entire movie instead.At the end of the movie, i then realised the mother is already dead and Norman Bates is considered as a person with psychiatric problem who impersonated his mother. It is really shocking and make me feel this movie is a must see thriller.Then the remake appeared and of course the audience will know what happen. The difference? colour,sound. The old movie is much more glim and dull with mono sound.8 out of 10",8,5,11,16 September 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," This is one of the best of die hard
","This movie is better than the first one, although i enjoy all the three movies, i can say this is good.Some setting in the city make me feel like in everyday life but more surprise on how the producer can bring the city to halt for the movie shooting.One thing about this movie is the camera movement in some part of the scene which is not good enough.",8,0,0,3 November 2000
It Chapter Two," Interesting story
","For Stephen King's fan, this is one of his story that we have to go and watch. Although I am not a native English speaker, I do enjoy watching horror film made in Hollywood.Now, what's missing from IT2? Well, nothing from story point of view but camera work or lighting makes me feel dizzy, instant flashing especially the cave scene.",8,1,1,17 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This episode makes me sad
","When i popped to the cinema and get a good look at this Episode 3, I believe the story can be very exciting and i was wrong for the first half an hour.But, when the story goes, it getting more interesting and the last 15 minutes should be the best one. It is the best and also the most crucial among all six star-wars movies. It is even better than Episode I and Episode II.Seeing Episode I makes me tired and Episode II makes me sleep. I think all the actors are doing their good job and the costumes, effects not to mention the music, sounds etc.",9,1,5,3 June 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," The most inspire movie about human determination
","The most inspire movie about human determination. The almost similar plot to 'The Green Mile' which i've seen before this one. What i can say the story is showing on how human should go on with their life no matter what happen and the needs of taking necessary action if possible.The character, Andy (which the same name with me, of course) has determine to take his wife life after knowing her of committing adultery. He has no choice but to take her life after afraid that she might gain most of his money (since he was a successful banker). As the result of his action, he was sent to the maximun security prison where he befriend a famous 'Smuggler' man nickname 'Red' played by Morgan Freeman.Life goes on. Actually some of the characters from the movie i've seen them in 'The Green Mile' and the story, as mentioned before, close to the one in 'The Green Mile' scene such as the classic movie that they watch, etc.I've seen lots of Stephen King's movie adaptation but these two 'The Green Mile' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' can be considered as one of the best drama movie i've ever seen.",9,0,0,2 September 2000
Shrek," Better and Funnier
","This cartoon has so much comical element that i can't stop to see it until the end.The fact is that the characters seem have their own attitude such as the 'Ogre' and the 'Donkey' but as i seen it, the supporting cast has better and more funnier dialogue than the main characters. Thumb up for the graphics, face and body expressions, they are real good.Enjoyable movie, one of the best. Well done.",8,0,0,18 July 2001
The Greatest Showman," Amazing story.
","The place where I live, people here are not attached to this kind of film but when 'The Greatest Showman' was shown on the cinema, I was amazed by the number of ticket sold.I can say that the story is mesmerising and everythings are simply perfect but there are two characters that really shocked me as an individual. I ask myself, do they go to acting class? Yes, I am talking about the characters from P.T. Barnum's daughters. They are two of the greatest stars that I have ever seen up to now. Great film. Really enjoyable.",9,1,3,6 January 2018

",One of the best action movie of the decade. This movie simple gives the audience a chance to feel the action right on the edge of the seat.I admire Sandra performance in this movie as she acts really natural and do funny. A must see.,8,0,0,8 September 2000
X2: X-Men United," Better than the first one but still lack of actions.
","I saw the first X-men movie and think many flaws occurred in the story. First, so little characters and the effects were poor. Secondly, the story is too limited and more like a drama. Then come this second installment.The second X-men is much more better, you have more characters, more action and more special effects, maybe because of the extra budget but hope you don't mind I'm saying. Supposed you are given 10 dollars you are not supposed to spend it all to make a better movie.Planning is a good idea. When we observed between the first X-men and the second X-men they are simply too close to each other and even in 1 year you can't really make a better movie unless you do a brainstorming. I don't know whether to salute Mr. Singer or not but it is amazing of how what he can do in such a short period of time.Anyway, all the X-men 2 team did a great job and the movie is really entertaining.",8,0,0,11 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," Very accurate and effective messages
","This movie has been written perfectly. The story seems flawless and all the story is making sense. At the end, we know what happen. I watched lots of movies and rated them accordingly but this one is my pick as a thriller and scary type of entertainment. I. How can i say... Most movie should be made like this, got the ending that making sense. One thing can be corrected is that the camera man shouldn't move to much when making a shot/pointing the camera for scene taking at the first 30 hours of the movie. It making people dizzy. Anyway, well done and keep up the good work.",9,0,0,26 October 1999
Final Destination," Excellent movie
","This is absolutely a well done movie. The script is simply acceptable and the story is superb. Although it makes the audience jump from the seat at sometimes, it makes all the story more scarier as the story goes on.The story of a student who got a vision about a plane accident. After trying to avoid death, he and several friends who got off the plane safely are magically killed one by one.The story is fine and excellent only when 'The Way' is mentioned. It seems that the accident is supposed to have its way on how the plane exploded, in this case from who to who. So by trying to figure it out again, the friends trying to cheat death again and at the end.. buk.. the story ends.Only the last part of the movie is bad, the rest is excellent.",9,0,2,28 September 2000
Braveheart," Beautiful
","Beautifully done movie, fighting scene, romance, drama almost everything has been done perfectly.There seems too many big budget movie, this one is one of the best. Mel Gibson certainly put lots of effort on this one and this movie has been prove successful.The end of the story is not as expected. Probably we do not know the end of some of his friends. Lucky, at the end, there is someone who narrate the rest of the story.",8,2,4,3 February 2001
Back to the Future," Good
","Time travel epic for the twentieth century. Although this movie actually produced in the late 80's and early 90's, the special effects have shown it inner strength. I have been seeing this movie for couple of time and finally I can get it rented on DVD. I can't find any really huge extra on it such as `Behind the Scenes' or `Outtakes'. Maybe the distributor should consider include this one as BTTF is a very entertaining science fiction movie ever produced.",7,0,1,4 May 2002
Jurassic Park," One of the best
","After watching this movie on DVD, it will never be the same again. After purchasing the disc, i went home and play it straight away. As a movie collector, i decided to see what's in it.The extra items on the DVD can be more but it should be enough. Apparently it seems something doesn't fully complete. Some of the extra is not fully digitised but overall is good.The action is well planned, the movie plot is good too. Only the part that i don't like is the dinosaurs do not show what they can do, only certain parts except the little creatures which shown almost 40% of the movie.But this is one of the best that i have seen.",7,1,3,13 October 2000
The Wizard of Oz," An excellent fantasy adventure
","This is the second musical i have watched since 'Evita'. What i have to say is the story is very well written although some of the effects might be poor if seen by audience who have watched 20th century effects setting.Judy was a wonderful teenager at that time and her ability to sing and dance make this movie very exciting.Nice costumes and setting, very imaginative props.",7,1,4,23 September 2000
The Island," Very entertaining although they are the same
","Actually i'm not interested in this movie because the 'cloning' theme has been around since year 1990's,remember 'The sixth Day'?. That is why i bought the DVD and saw it myself at home. Overall the action is good, the costume, not too bad but the story itself kind of dull/empty.The leading actor and actress are wonderful. They act perfectly and they deserves compliment from this movie.The car, well, that's marvelous, superb and totally enjoyable but too bad that we can't see the interior of it. From outside they look good but from inside, we never know because this is only a movie and everybody can messed around with the props or even the characters.Make new story and better plot because the story is pretty long and very boring.",8,0,0,12 February 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O what a wonderful movie.
","I think this one is not as good as the previous Mr Coen's movie. The plot is ok but what i find out this movie did not have any interesting part at the first half an hour. What i believe is good from this script is the musical, how great that Mr Clooney can sings in his part, simply too good.Beside that, i found something very different. The colour of the movie change sometimes near the end. Maybe the projector is not good or the movie is create to be like that.One more to comment, it seems that the camera has too many close-up. All the things that appear on the screen looks very big even-though i sit right at the back.",7,0,0,17 May 2001
