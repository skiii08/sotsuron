The Lion King," An honest, non whiny review.
","I went to go and see the lion king today and I thoroughly enjoyed this disney remake.Yes okay, they removed the morning report and be prepared wasn't as musically impressive as the cartoon which did disappoint a little but really they are only small issues for me.This remake still gave me chills via the musical scores and the visuals are breathtaking. I thought the voice acting was perfectly adequate.The lion king 2019 made me just as emotional as the original cartoon and it gave my childhood favourite a new breath of life.Overall, I loved this film. Thank you disney",9,1,4,19 July 2019
