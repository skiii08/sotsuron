The Double Life of Véronique," Wonderful
","'All my life I've felt like I was here and somewhere else at the same time'Weronika lives in Poland. She lost her mother as a kid. She has a gift for music, and especially singing. She likes to apply a golden ring around her eye. She runs a lot. She is always breathless because of a heart defect that she is unaware of. She is searching for love. Veronique lives in France. She lost her mother as a kid. She has a gift for music, and she teaches it to young children. She likes to apply a golden ring around her eye. She runs a lot. She is always breathless because of a heart defect that has just been found out. She is searching for love. Weronika sees Véronique in Krakow, the city she lives in. She stops in the middle of a place crowded with people demonstrating and riot squads. Her alter ego is getting on a bus which will take her back to France. Before the bus leaves, Véronique has time to take pictures of the place and of Weronika, but she does not see her. During the first half-hour of the film, the subjective shots which represent Weronika's vision are unsteady, the fisheye angle twists the perspectives, until Weronika herself collapses, on the stage, among the music instruments and in front of the audience, in the middle of a song. After Weronika's death, we follow Véronique. She is making love with a man, and, right after it, she feels an immense sadness. She says to her lover « It's as if I were grieving » but she is unable to explain why. She decides to give up on the concert she was preparing, the same concert, we can imagine, during which Weronika died. Véronique follows her intuition, and Weronika's death prevents her from dying herself. In the school where Véronique teaches, a man manipulates puppets for the children. He makes the puppet die and become a sort of angel. Later on, Vétonique receives an anonymous phone call, then she gets a lace in the mail, and then an audio tape thanks to which she finds the place from where the anonymous man sends his objects to her. She finds him in a bar in the Gare Saint Lazare in Paris. She recognizes the puppeteer. In a hotel, after they have made love, and confessed their love, she empties her purse on the bed because he wants to know her better. He looks at the photos she took during her trip in Eastern Europe. He says that she is pretty on the pictures. She notices Weronika for the first time. She starts to cry. Weeks, maybe months later, she wakes up in the middle of the night and finds her lover making a second puppet of herself. She asks why he made two puppets of her, and he says that it is because they get damaged. She manipulates one puppet, while the other is lying motionless. The puppeteer reads to her the first version of a tale he is writing about two women on two different continents who are in fact two versions of the same person. This focus on the puppets reminded me of an essay written by Furio Jesi on Rilke's poetry. Jesi writes: the doll, in its form, tragically announces to men that it is her, not them, who will survive in the Infinite. ». To me, the puppets are a reminder of the fate that awaits Véronique as well, that is death. The two women will disappear in death but the two puppets will remain. There is a very important dreamlike dimension in the film which features a dwarf who is also a lawyer, an old exhibitionnist, conversations of secondary characters with no beginning and no end, a subjective shot of the dead Weronika being buried. The film is also very poetic. I think of two shots in particular: the two versions of the old lady crossing the screen, and the image of the old church reflected backwards in a plastic ball. To appreciate this film, you need to get rid of the need to understand and analyze everything, and accept the absurd side of reality. My sister saw the film with me, and at one point she said: « there is something in this film that is us. » That « something » can be defined as the atmosphere, the setting, the green and red colors. the light. Kieslowski's movie addresses that part of our brain that is the center of our emotions, of our sensations, and of the memories of those sensations. It remains with us like an old dream that we had forgotten.",9,0,1,2 May 2013
Oblivion," Visually beautiful but that's it
","We are in 2077. Tom Cruise's voice explains us that the Earth has been devastated by aliens, the Scavs, and that they also have destroyed the Moon. Men won the war, but they had to leave the Earth to go live on Titan, one of Jupiter's (or Saturne's, I'm not sure which) satellites. Before they can join them, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are some kind of maintenance workers in charge of the drones, these little round flying and aggressive machines. The Tet, which is like a big pyramid in the sky, also hires Jack and Victoria to take care of the pumps that suck sea water. For maintenance workers, they have a pretty cool high-tech house that looks like it's hanging in the air, and that has an awesome transparent swimming-pool in which Jack and Victoria play doctor. But every night, Jack dreams of this brunette who smiles at him in the streets and who smiles at him again on top of the Empire State. He knows he knows her, but doesn't know who she is. And the cool home, and the cool pool, he doesn't care about them. Like Walden in Thoreau's book, he likes to go to a little wooden house by the lake to take a nap. And he likes the Earth too, he doesn't want to leave it, even if it's a dangerous place. So anyway. One day the girl from his dream literally falls from the sky, and with her he realizes that all he thought he knew is a big lie. A little bit of 2001, A Space Odyssey, a little bit of transcendantalism, some baseball, some romance, and a lot of special effects. Joseph Kosinski loves special effects, 3D and gadgets, and he's pretty good at that. Of course if you're looking for substance for your brain, I suggest you to go see something else.",5,1,4,2 May 2013
