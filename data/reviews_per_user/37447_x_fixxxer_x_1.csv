Requiem for a Dream," amazing film, amazing music
","the movie was great in all respects, but i just particularly liked how the music connected so well with the scenes, action, and feelings of the characters.  very good job on this one.  i tell all my friends to watch it, and im not one to recommend movies",10,0,1,13 July 2003
