Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Best of the Pirates of the Caribbean series so far!
","Definitely my favorite of the first four movies! The characters are deeper, the comradery warmer and the love more bitter than in the other movies. Also, the reckless yet non-evil spirit of a pirate is revealed against the backdrop of true evil. I like the fact that this movie has more interesting dialogue and less mindless action.",9,0,1,21 April 2017
Oblivion," Positive Surprise
","I didn't have high hopes, when I went to see this.Immediately though I was captivated by the beautiful visual style in both the landscape, architecture and especially the cool technology (HUDs and touch-screens etc.). It was simply stunning!As for the plot, it wasn't too original as such, but I loved the 'husband and housewife' -interplay between 'Jack' and 'Victoria'. It was somehow cozy to see a single couple alone in a vast rough environment - together, but separated. There was a distinct air of longing about the whole setup.One of the most memorable (and silliest) moments was when 'Jack' rode his motorcycle for a long stretch of desert. Seemed kinda pointless for him to have to use a motorcycle but it was a nice scene otherwise.Which brings me to the music. I loved it. I give the movie 8/10 for the visual style, music and the bitter-sweet chemistry between the main characters.",8,3,4,15 August 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Anticlimatic
","The whole movie jumps from one great feeling built up and ruined immediately. Every scene where it feels like now its going to happen, the tension is removed and some new mindless plot starts.Dropped and failed subplots have been mentioned by many. Now, to be fair, its kinda realistic to depict a failure every now and then. However, the subplot with Finn and Rose was a total waste. The right way to do it would be to at least redeem the cryptovillain from his evil ways, like a new Han Solo character.Finn and Rose miraculously escape without adding anything to the story. They didn't have anything to offer the rebellion either. No map or anything.On the topic of maps, the map to Luke's location turns out to be useless... Luke doesn't want to be found and will not help.Luke was manic depressive and Yoda was high on drugs.Rey was my favorite character in VII but now her blandness reaches new heights. Without any struggle, without any training, she faces the beckoning of the dark side without breaking a sweat (touches mirror) and handles Snoke's high guard without problem (again, without any training).Considering that she is the first on-screen female Jedi character, it would have been interesting to have a more intricate story built around the question of her gender. In my fantasies, Rey meets Rose, who in her nerdniness has collected Jedi books and reads them to Rey, who isn't one for formal education herself. Rose would become the swordbearer of this female knight. I could see a cringeworty humorous scene where Rose reads to Rey and says 'it says here anchient woman jedi would drink the milk of thala sirens to repleish their midi-chlorian count during their periods' or something like that. You know, kinda like Anakin struggled with his hormones. But no, Rey is basically playing a male character with no thought given to her femininity.Jaw droppingly bad movie. More like a mindless action blast.",1,2,3,29 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Excellent Action Movie and Faithful to the originals
","Wow! I'm positively surprised by the new Star Wars movie! The story is perhaps a bit too much like episode IV, but then again that was my favorite episode and perhaps its not altogether wrong for stories like these to come in cycles.The music was OK, though a bit thin (as if the composer had been afraid to depart too far from the original score; it was too timid and unimpressive to me). The old themes popped up every now and then to my feeling 'at least put the old themes HERE'. Like when princess Leah appeared with her theme playing. Very touching.Harrison Ford had a very prominent role and was seen on the screen for most of the movie. So was Chewie, played by a Finnish basketball player. Harrison was my original reason for seeing the movie.The new cast and generations of Jedi and darksiders... amazing! The new Jedi girl Rey was a very solid character and well played. The acting _could_ have been immature and flamboyant, but was not at all so; her character performance was as good as one can expect. Some have taken issue with how fast Rey's 'training' was, but it didn't really bother me since the character was otherwise so unassuming and genuine (scared orphan girl beaten by harsh conditions into a cynical workhorse that does not expect anything from the false promises of a grand future in space). I expected a 'quota' black guy in the movie, but again his character was deep and genuine. They say that the good guys die first in war, and that's kinda what happened to him too, though I suppose we will see him again.I will probably want to see the next episode and the story of Rey and maybe even Luke Skywalker (played by himself he-hee).By the way, that Star Destroyer looked awesome pointing right at you in Dolby 3D.",10,57,129,21 December 2015
