United 93," Painful
","I thought it was extremely well put together. Very subdued. Not very dramatic, which made it feel very real. I felt like I was living what these people went through, and I felt so scared throughout the movie. I wanted to turn it off many times. If you are someone like me, who lost loved ones in tragedy, and live in constant fear of that happening again, I don't recommend it. It just was very painful. For general viewing public, I think this story was much more real and worth your time than movies like World Trace Centre. I also liked how they didn't try to make the terrorists look like evil people. It just showed what happened in very dry manner. I think that was great, because I don't think it's that these people were evil, but there is something wrong with the world where we create so much hate.",10,2,4,8 July 2007
Up," Pixar does it again!
","Thinking about it brings tears to my eyes again. I took my 5 year old daughter and her friend. From children's perspective, it was very entertaining. They were laughing and talking about dogs for long time. Some fighting scenes scared them a tiny bit, but not much. From adult's perspective, it was really deep, unpredictable, and touching. The best thing for me, personally, was that I dreamed of going to Guiana highlands all my childhood. From the trailer, I had no idea that's what this was about. It was really exciting for me that someone from Pixar (the studio I respect more than anything else! and my dream place to work!) also had a similar feelings for Guiana Highlands.I never thought Pixar can top the heights of Wall-E, but apparently, they can do it again and again.I strongly recommend it to everyone!",9,2,4,6 June 2009
