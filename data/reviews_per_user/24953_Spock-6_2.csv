Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The beginning chapter of the saga that changed motion picture history
","I thought the PHANTOM MENACE was a really good movie.  You can tell how much Lucas has evolved the field of visual effects sinc e RETURN OF THE JEDI. Back then people still liked the effects.  The storyline was wonderful. The best sequences were the pod race and the Darth Maul vs. Qui-Jon Ginn and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  It was also nice to see the familiar faces of C3PO, R2-D2, and Jabba the Hutt. Jar Jar Binks provides some of the best sidekick action since Chewbacca. This movie is what people actually worth the price of admission.",10,0,0,25 May 1999
MASH," One of the funniest black comedies ever!
","MASH is one of the funniest comedies ever. I just got the movie a while back, and I was impressed. It reminds me of what the TV series was, but with a little more.  Robert Altman did a good job on this movie, and without him, MASH probably would not have made it into the sensation it is today.",Null,0,1,15 November 1999
