First Man," Original take on the space race and moon landing.
","The movie focuses on the sad and negative aspects of astronaut Neil Armstrongs life. I can not remember a single happy/fun moment in the entire film. It also lacks any kind of triumphant moments. Even the moon landing, and time directly after, is portrayed as a sad moments for Neil Armstrong.
Most factual things in the movie are accurate as far as I know, but they are cherry picked to display the most sad moments during the programme and in Neils life.This is very different from most other movies, and can be an interesting wath, as long as one is prepared to go away feeling a bit sad yourself.
However I am afraid that a 2+ hour long movie without a single positive moment can easily feel a bit dull, hence why I did not give it a higher score.",7,1,2,14 October 2018
