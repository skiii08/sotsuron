Mission: Impossible III," Just few too many jokes
","I like this movie, not as previous two, but its close. I like the action sequences, one of the best shot most definitely, breathe taking, fast, exploding and most important well constructed and thoughtfully done. Unfortunately the characters have very few lines and no space to be developed in all that action, though they are not left totally faceless. The exception is the villain who doesn't have much time as other characters, but is fully blooded, powerful and completely frightening, an outstanding performance by Academy Award Winning Hoffman. However the thing that stooped me from giving higher score are the jokes which were well fit and entertaining through whole movie, but insisting on them in the ending scenes was destructing and little bit annoying. The same mistake JJ Abrams did 3 years later with Star Trek.",9,0,1,6 August 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Lack of characters, emotions and meaning
","From a director that brought us Four Weddings and a Funeral and the best Harry Potter I was expecting lot better movie... for example... dark, inventive, exciting, romantic, funny... but no, You won't find those things here, just a meaningless Hollywood mambo jumbo.Gyllenhaal has done probably the worst choice in His career, but Kingsley is safe since that place is taken by BloodRayne. Gemma is pretty, and the only refreshment here was Molina who was really funny and if it wasn't for Him I would have maybe stopped watching it.Also good thing is that it's better than Clash of the Titans, mostly because Clash was trying desperately to be serious, and the fights are better here.",6,2,4,29 August 2010
Troy," Theatrical and director's cut
","Making a movie based on Homer's Iliad, an epic poem full of characters, romances and battles, even loosely based is a tough job, doomed to unfair comparisons from the very beginning but Petersen has done it... and He has done a hell of a job. The thing is He has tighten the story just enough for this millennium, making the right decisions what to keep from the original story and what to discard (most notable the gods and supernatural part of the story). The balance between the emotional side of the story and the brutal side is caught excellent, perfectly integrated, not overshadowing each other. The characters are meaty; the romances are sweet and erotic, while the fights are bloody gore.",10,0,3,31 August 2010
Knowing," Professional critics once again proved to be wrong
","Great movie, much better than expected. My low expectations were due to the mainstream critics, who once again proved to be tasteless for something different, wrapped up as Hollywood blockbuster, but indeed it is a philosophical journey and I am thankful for that.It is a gripping sci-fi mystery thriller drama that starts slow, than speeds up and doesn't let go until before the end, when You will be treated with a one of the best endings in its genre, if not the best. Daring, brave, uncompromising, unexpected epilogue which sadly angered lot of people who weren't enough open minded for this somewhat brutal ending.Also it is total rubbish the criticism that it is pro-religious because it is rather anti-religious, since it is clearly presented that there is no god, but a different higher form of life.",9,2,6,9 October 2010
The Hurt Locker," Characters and tension build well this movie
","Almost documentary told war drama story, with characters masterfully developed to their bare core through scenes filled with tension. The tension is build slowly through literally every scene without break even when the soldiers are resting and socialize. The bottom line is the difference between people who are attracted by war and ones that are repulsed, no matter how good friends are or how similar they might look alike in some situations, the red line is there and is not thin.The reason I didn't score it with bigger score is, on occasions was too slow and the action scenes were on a moments too documentary. You can also try with In the Valley of Elah and Courage Under Fire, but by all means don't try anything with Green Zone.",8,12,18,3 August 2010
Clash of the Titans," Clash of disappointments
","I've seen the original movie couple of times as a kid, and I was very excited about this movie. So the story is epic, the lead actor (Sam) is a really good choice, the English cast (Liam, Ralph & Pete) was great, Gemma was simply beautiful and visually this movie was excellent, but too bad the action scenes itself were confused, ranging from not enough exciting to boring and not even to mention predictable. But the real pain is that the characters were hollow and pointless, and their lines were just included to fill space between two special effects. The director should have seen King Kong by Peter Jackson before doing this remake. My recommendations beside the perfect King Kong, are Beowulf and Outlander. Enjoy in those movies.",4,1,2,1 August 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Second worst after 'Planet of the Apes'
","I thought Tim Burton was unable to make another heartless movie like 'Planet of the Apes', but unfortunately I was wrong, so wrong. This one is better than the 'Planet...', but still such a big disappointment that comes from one of the few visionaries that work in Hollywood.Visually this movie is stunning and it didn't stop being for the whole time, but that is the only thing that works perfectly for this movie. The humor also works fine and succeeds, maybe not perfectly as we are used from Burton, but doesn't misses and provides sufficient number of laughs.The problem begun and end with the emotional side of the movie. Making beautiful emotional stories is the thing that separates Burton from most of His colleagues who are directing big budget Hollywood flicks. But this time He joins them and fails almost completely delivering emotions and characters that you care for.",5,2,5,15 October 2010
Invictus," Inspiring
","Clint Eastwood did it again, He again makes a powerful movie and it looks like He did it without trying too much, but off course it looks easy when a mastermind is doing it. Anyone else would've made it just another sports cheesy movie, but not Eastwood.This movie is about the icon Nelson Mandela and certain point in His life when He became a president of a burning South Africa and how He managed to rose to the challenge, and to tame the burning hate, through a sport event, against all odds. We are honored to have a small look in the life of one of the greatest man humanity has met, the courage, the perseverance, the excellent sense of humor, the uplifting words, and the actual cell in which unfortunately He has spent big part of His life.In the end, I must say, masterful performance by Morgan Freeman.",8,1,1,7 September 2010
The Descent," Girls that will make your adrenaline rush
","A story seen so many times before, but what does makes this one better than most and among the best, is keeping in touch with reality on all levels. The story is build slowly while you sink into deep anticipation in the cave that is horrifying itself, but it can't prepare you enough for the terror that follows. The creatures are created visually excellent, but their real monstrosity comes from the way they act, aware that they are predators, but yet they are cautious when hunt as every nature's predator and feel fear too which gives a definitive attribution to the realism, unlike most monsters that are just fearless killing machines. The characters are not cardboards which always include 'funny' and 'all evil' ones that must die at some point. Big advantage is that they are all girls which leave you without 'necessary romance' and sacrifice of the male in the end so the girl can ultimately escape. The girls are a sports tip, they search for adrenaline rush, they are not by some odd coincidence in the cave which explains their fighting abilities and their hotness off course. The actions scenes are tense, frightening and detailed which makes you grasp in your chair. And there is a second story that includes conflict between our heroes. Highly recommended.",9,2,5,4 August 2010
When Harry Met Sally...," So, this is how it all started
","It was about time for me to see this movie. And all the good words are deserved. Too bad it has spawned one of the most predictable, boring, annoying, over repetitive sub-genres.It is evident that the movie draws lot of inspiration from Woody Allen style, but it is more tighten for a wider audience, but luckily not dumbed, like is done these days.So what does this film has that todays don't? It is intelligently, patiently done, not hurrying for the romance or forcing jokes and avoids successfully to be predictable and pathetic. The chemistry works between the leading actors, and the supporting characters are more than decor to fill space. The biggest difference is that it keeps in touch with the reality and drama that makes it more intense.",8,1,1,1 October 2010
Centurion," Hell of a movie
","Excellent movie, that goes beyond expected and has a surprises, though it is made of already known ingredients. But that territory is already conquered by Neil Marshall with His previous efforts (Dog Soldiers and The Descent), redefining a genres well known stories.Only this time it's not a horror, it is an epic story, and instead of slowly building the tension toward the end, there is a change of pace, and subsequently the blood starts to run from the very beginning. Also there is a romance, a small, but effective and meaningful, not forced at all.In the end I have to mention the great acting, and introduction of one the creepiest female villain played by a beautiful woman.For the very end I have to add that the Marshalls talent of making intelligently choreographed action sequences is also present, and the scenes are bloody as hell.",8,4,11,10 September 2010
Up in the Air," Life is... bitter sweet
","What a movie. You actually travel through the story; you are on a journey through emotions, while the main character travels through the states. There are no stunts in this movie, everyone is portrayed, and people that appear even for 5 seconds will touch you.The director is taking us on a walk through the genres of drama, romance and comedy masterfully, without a single flaw, like a child in a store for candies, and He gave us the right amount of what we want and what we need. Some viewers will cry for that sweet candy and why does He gave us as much as the bitter candy... but that's life. Bitter-Sweet.Everyone of the cast was perfect, but I feel I need to mention the outstanding performance by George Clooney and the cult scene in the Airplane where He receives His long awaited recognition card, and how He played that scene is beyond words.",10,0,2,24 August 2010
