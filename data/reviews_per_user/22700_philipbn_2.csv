Marie Antoinette," Stick to what you know....
","My response to this film falls with all those who are observing what a fundamentally weak piece of work it is. Obviously some enjoy it for their various reasons, but I have to agree with many others that this film is poorly done in many ways and on many levels: pacing and narrative are incredibly weak, the music and visuals are annoying (to me), and the historical angle is woefully bad. Poor Kirsten Dunst, to have soldiered through her role in such a disaster! It seems to be me that the film demonstrates that filmmakers only really make films about what they know (not an original conclusion, but this film seems a good demonstration of the general principle). After succeeding with Lost in Translation, clearly Ms. Coppola has a good grasp on subject matter involving rich yuppies living in privileged circumstances in the Reagan-Bush era. Here, I think, she has tried to project this kind of subject matter back onto the late eighteenth century, but, alas, she knows nothing about the late eighteenth century, or the French Revolution, etc. She should have picked subject matter she could get a better grasp on.I hope she's able to recover from this one and follow it with something successful.",2,24,48,5 October 2006
Forrest Gump," 'Being an idiot is no box of chocolates' (the original line from the novel)
","A movie with this many comments obviously has great resonance. On the one hand, the movie is technically skillful, well-acted, and used then-advanced special effects to great advantage. As demonstrated by the comments here, it has charmed many viewers. On the other, the movie's values and message are clearly right wing: as many other reviewers point out, the plot rewards ignorance, unquestioning obedience, and laissez-faire corporatization (the marks of a good heart, apparently!), while it trivializes retardation to charm viewers with a saccharine vision of idiocy as goodness. It provides a right-wing allegory of recent US history by punishing the free-thinking Jenny and rewarding the mindless Forrest, named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Charming!I share the view of those who not entertained by the movie's right-wing allegory of Reagan-Bush era know-nothingism and historical blindness. As another commenter put it, 'this is a movie for people who voted for Reagan' or for the Bushes. Overall, it's a remarkable document of Reagan-Bush era dominant thinking.So the basic situation with this movie is not too difficult to grasp: the movie is skillfully made and acted, and the wide success of its right-wing plot and message demonstrates that the American movie-going public largely shares these right-wing views.",1,70,168,14 January 2007
