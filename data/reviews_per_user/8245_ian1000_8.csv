Marie Antoinette," Looks wonderful but looks are skin deep
","As a fan of historic films I looked forward to this re-telling of a well known story. I hoped that I would not be disappointed by glaring historical errors and having just re-watched 'The Madness Of King George' hoped that Coppola's film would be as engrossing and well executed.Well, the film looked awesome. The sets, costumes, and camera-work are a credit to all concerned.The main problems with the movie are a lack of depth. The story of the tragic Austrian is invariably connected to the famous revolution which caused her death (we don't see that, either) yet we witness little of the revolution save for an angry mob at the palace bearing torches.The other main problem is that Dunst simply cannot carry the role. She delivered her lines with all the dignity of a cheerleader or burger bar waitress.When watching the movie I thought of the Doctor Who episode (set earlier in the eighteenth century) and how a British actress such as Sophia Myles would have been so much more suited to the part.Overall, quite enjoyable but could have been so much more.As entertaining as the film is a trawl through the IMDb comments - the 'plants' are a more blatant than usual.",5,3,4,15 November 2007
Star Trek," Spectacular But Not Trek
","With plot holes 5 parsecs wide, Star Trek The Next Next Generation arrives! I have to admit to sort of enjoying it, and the Uhura/Spock parts brought forth a large smile, but I realised towards the end that the new timeline was not going to be restored. You could rewrite TOS, TNG, DS9 VOY and the movies - lots of aspects are subject to change; no 'Amok Time', no 'Balance of Terror' surprise at the Romulans, no 'Cage' or 'Menagarie' etc etc.Such a shame that the wrong actor was cast as Scotty; stick to the simple comedies Simon.If I was voting for only Quinto's performance I'd give 9/10 though.",6,20,35,13 May 2009
Interstellar," IMAX disappointment of 2014
","I only stayed the duration so that I could write a review. I'd heard that the script was less than perfect, so I went to my local IMAX mainly for a visual treat. Nothing took away my breath. The space scenes uninspiring , the planet scenes were OK not not worth my 3 hours.The plot veers into dreadful sentimentality, and the 'clever parts' are unconvincing.Having said all that, the end scenes were good, and even moving.'Gravity' lacked much of a plot, but it looked a lot better than this, and was a lot more enjoyable. Such a shame.",5,5,11,9 November 2014
Pitch Black," Predictable Slasher In Space Movie
","I loathed this movie, I was amazed that in 2000 it was possible to make a film that was so predictable, so clich√©d and so tired.The hero, well he's not a hero, he's a criminal but guess what he's not bad really...Thrill as the most loathsome characters are killed in gruesome ways on a strange planet.On the plus side, the acting's pretty good, despite the cast being mostly Australian, and there's an early look at future SG-1 babe Claudia Black sounding and looking an awful lot like Vala Mal Doran, before dying horribly. The spaceship crash at the start is good too.Rent the DVD and skip through it.",3,0,2,2 April 2007
Children of Men," Tedious plot well filmed
","My summary says it all. The movie is about a grim future (again, yawn) and features some impressive gun battles with civilians and combatants running fighting and hiding, in scenes similar to Beruit in 1982 yet it's England 2027. The camera work appears to be hand-held, the footage suitably gritty and washed out.It's a depressing film but not because it predicts a grim future - the grimness is about infertility that started in a couple of years from now, yet this issue is barely discussed, never explored.The performances range from very good to adequate, but the film and ending was oh so predictable. Lots of style not a lot of substance.",3,5,10,8 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A superb movie (ignore the old fans)
","I loved this movie., but then again, I'm not really a Star Wars fan; I just enjoy the movies.So here's what I enjoyed about this one:-It opens in space (again) and with a superb battle.
More space battles.
A ground battle Empire style.
No Harrison Ford to over-act.
The celebrated silent space scene.
The best 3D I've seen in ages.Not so good:-The mission to the Casino planet.
Too many cute animals. Shades of Ewoks.
Leia and her force magic rescue. In fact, Leia.
The usual re-used elements from earlier movies.I sat in a 3D IMAX full of cheering viewers, some weeks after it opened. We all loved it.I don't give a damn who Snoke was, or Rey's parents or what happened to Luke.Looking forward to the next ones, including the Solo one.",9,1,3,6 January 2018
Blade Runner," Harrison Ford is not keen on it either
","Certainly the most over-rated sci-fi film of our time. OK it looked quite distinct in 1982, and the image of a grim future with giant TV screens high above the city was memorable.Plot? There's not much to say, the film contradicts itself many times and the weak and limp tale crawls along.Acting? Ford's OK, Young is pretty and dull, Olmos is cool, twenty years before being cool fighting Cylons, and Hannah is sexy but hopelessly out of her depth.Apologists for Scott's fiasco blame the evil 'suits' for messing up their Lord's film but in truth the directors cut is worse than the original movie.The sound is badly mixed too - why is that? See Trancers instead - at least it's funny as well as dated.",1,25,70,2 April 2007
Cloud Atlas," A Breathtaking Viewing Experience
","We sat down not knowing much about this movie other than its length. The fast forward was not needed, the tea breaks were not required, the phones went unanswered, the cats had to wait for their supper, and the final scene had us tears.I can believe that some would find this film difficult to follow; focus your mind and all will become clear. If your taste goes no higher than action films or romantic comedies, this movie will be above your level.The action does switch between the six stories (in six time periods) fluidly but logically, the links between the six stories do become clear.I think I have a new favourite film, and a new entry on my wish list (hurry up with that blu-ray).",10,3,6,29 December 2012
