It," Terrible acting, KIDS JUST DON'T DO THOSE THINGS!
","CGI, a few jumps, mostly loud music Cliché after cliché, the kid gang has a 'funny one', smart one, fat one, kind one, a black guy, a girl, yawn Some totally OTT bullies, one of whom wanted to carve his name in the fat kid, with a knife! WHY??? Why would you write your own effing name and give yourself away? The way the kid gang spoke to each other was the most ridiculous, like they were 50 year old soulmates who would die for each other. Kids simply don't act like that!",2,1,3,13 November 2017
The Way Back," Yawn! Too many holes!
","Great scenery, but that's about it, too many goofs and holes, not to mention that 'history' is merely a set of events that are agreed upon! Lots of time spent with the group walking through a desert, living off a berry, a snake, and a muddy puddle, that they somehow manage to fill their bags and bottles, full of water?? A well, filled to the top with clean looking water, in the middle of a desert??? how? why? who put the water there? A sandstorm that knocks everyone to the ground for an hour or so, yet they still have buckets of water that they were carrying? One scene, one guy kills a snake, whilst the other 4 are lying in the sand, dying, the next scene, they have somehow built a large rock shelter, using near perfectly formed bricks, they have built a fie and a brick BBQ, and said snake is now simmering on it, like chicken?? Come on! The final stages are comical, they somehow reach Tibet, the 4 remaining, dying guys, including Ed Harris, who must be 134 years old, they wake to find one of their party is missing, the two younger guys go look for him, and see him climbing a mountain top, just disappearing out of sight (the Himalayas, no, really!) So they run after him, the next shot they have caught up, and have fully scaled the Himalayas, in the rags they were wearing, in their near death state! Come on! Its the small details that count!",3,2,3,10 November 2017
Thor," Same as all its sequels!
","A garbled mass of CGI and special effects.
Everyone is beautiful, tattooed, bright blue eyes
Thor himself isn't even muscular, just 'athletic'
Its like watching the old power rangers, anytime someone gets struck, a 'metallic' sound is heard, or sparks come out of them, even against skin!
With every punch, a 'whoosh' sound is heard
The long jumps have the character flying through the air without rotating, as usual, like they were being suspended via a harness (they are!)Its just boring and predictable, it may hold the concentration of children, but they could raise their game a bit, for the older, more observant viewers!
Its hard to remember who's fighting who, who is 'good' (those with the blue eyes) and who is bad (the 'english accented' characters..)
Its hard to care too, its just so easy to see the plot and continuity errors. Yawn!",3,0,0,24 February 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," false flag Terrorism, CIA black ops, fairy tales
","An entertaining film, but only if you still believe the greatest lie ever sold to the public. After denying any involvement in 9/11, former CIA asset Osman bin laden (CIA name 'Tim Osman') dies in Dec 2001 from mar fan syndrome and is buried in Pakistan, this is reported on 2 major news outlets. Several years later, it is claimed he is killed by Navy seal team 6, his body dumped in the ocean instantly so as 'to be respectful' to Muslims. No video or pi cs exist of his alleged death, and 2/3 of seal team 6 are soon 'killed' in a helicopter crash, first put down to 'a terrorist rocket', then 'friendly fire'..this film is great for all those sheep still clutching to the ridiculous phrase 'war on terror', despite seeing 3 buildings turn to dust in midair on 9/11, a tiny hole in pentagon wall and a passenger jet shot down (flight 93), a huge gold bullion heist from WTC, and the WMD lie, yet still can't see this for what it is, a 'false flag operation', please watch, it is right up your street!! 9/11 wasn't done by Muslim extremists! did you see any commercial airliners on 9/11? you have been had, either way plenty of action for those of you who still have your eyes shut!",Null,4,10,24 January 2013
