Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Greatest Popcorn Story Ever Told.
","Many have complained about juvenile humor, two-dimensional characters and a lack of story in The Phantom Menace.  Then the same people (most in their early 30's by now) lambast Lucas for ruining 'their vision' of what Star Wars is all about.Psst...little secret here: Star Wars was, is, and always will be a kids' movie.  Young boys saving the universe, old wizard, magical swords and evil, black-helmeted bad guys...the stuff of Saturday-morning serials.  It's a shame all of us older kids have attached this bizarre pseudo-religion onto what is essentially the greatest popcorn story ever told.What?  You were expecting Citizen Kane?  Well, in terms of groundbreaking special effects, The Phantom Menace is quite similar.  The technology used to tell this story (that of the fall of the Old Republic and the rise of the Empire) is nothing short of breath-taking. With SW1, movies have truly entered the digital age.  As for the story...it's one of the oldest in human existence.  I say give George a break and give him a hand...he's crafted a beautiful movie that made me feel like I did when I was five-years old again.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," A *superior* ghost story.
","I was intrigued by the premise but hesitant.  Everyone whispered in the trailer, it looked like another supernatural action film, and Bruce Willis has hair (the less hair he seems to have, the better his part).Boy, was I wrong.Everything about this movie was well crafted.  The performances from the boy and his mother were very natural...and Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances *ever*.  The lighting, music and script are similarly excellent.One interesting feature is that many of the scenes begin with a 'pillow shot' (a Japanese technique where incongruous scenes of nature 'pillow' the area between scenes...a cinematic pause, if you will).  Except where the typical pillow shot is a stream, mountain or seashore (see the works of Takeshi 'Beat' Kitano for examples), these shot in 'The Sixth Sense' are dark, brooding, somber and sometimes menacing.  They're not at all overtly scary or shocking...but they will disquiet you.Between this and 'The Blair With Project,' perhaps film-makers are learning that size (and noise, and blood) doesn't matter after all.  We can only hope...",10,0,0,6 August 1999
