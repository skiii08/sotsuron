Insidious: Chapter 2," does this stand up to the original or is it a convoluted mess?
","The original insidious is a modern masterpiece in the horror genre. While its technicals can be rooted back to other movies- it is still an impressive work that shouldn't be missed by any horror fan. Now a a sequel would be hard work- but this movie came out a few months after the conjuring- a film even scarier than the first insidious that is just as good if not better. Now I'm not going into the technicals of those films because I want to talk about this film. But it is impossible not to at least get an idea of those films before talking about this. So Insidious chapter 2 actually starts with a flashback to Josh's problems being diagnosed by Elise before it picks up immediately where the original left off. Now the story here is the biggest part of the movie- but I can't go too deep without giving spoilers. But as it is it actually mostly works. A common complaint against this movie is that it's confusing and convoluted- and I am going to admit there are scenes that are like this, but the story as a whole does make sense. The story is for sure on a larger scale than the original but that's not a bad thing. It also follows the only route it could have taken after the ending of the original. Actually in a lot of respects thanks to the story this actually is almost better than the original. But as I said there are still problems and yes they do hold this movie down. There are a few scenes, and events that don't make sense, and since this movie is about finding answers it really hurts when a few important points simply don't get explained. If I can I may do a second review where I go into these details but as of now I don't think I'm ready to explain something like that. Anyways, there is one other problem- and that this film attempts to add comedy through the spec characters. I don't even know why comedy was written into this movie- and it is VERY out of place when it happens (well there is one funny line but it's at the end and isn't even delivered by either spec). I wound up choosing to ignore this part of the movie, but I know other people won't be able to. Now the horror scenes in the movie are on par with the original (there are some jump scare Esq scenes, but the movie doesn't rely on them). Some of the imagery is actually really creepy and fits nicely. Not only that the performances are also really good- especially Patrick Wilson, who really showcases a lot of talent here. Overall this movie mostly works but gets stuck on some roadblocks it could have easily avoided. I feel I can't do this movie's successes and failings without spoiling anything. So I guess the best thing to do is watch this movie for yourself and make your own judgments.",7,0,0,13 June 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," an epic modern masterpiece
","What are action movies today? They are a sea of CG, PG-13s just for the label, Marvel super heroes, and Michael Bay jokes. But every so often there is something like this. and while this is an existing franchise this moves shows us what a modern action movie should be. One of the draws of the original Mad Max trilogy is the real stuntwork during the action scenes. There really is something special about watching an actual stunt and knowing it was done for real. Mad Max Fury Road actually is real stuntwork like it's predecessors- but not only that it is far more ambitious in every action scene. Just about every move someone makes or a crash during an action scene here really is a spectacle. The theatrical trailer is just a small taste of what happens. And I estimate that 50-75% of this movie is pure action- yet it somehow doesn't grow old. But this is not a CG free film. However CG was only used to remove stuff like rigging and wires- which makes the action even more spectacular. Another spectacle this movie has to offer is the production design. Just looking at the vehicles and how most of them are pieces of different vehicles is just incredible- and they all were real. And at last there's the story. This movie sort of is a remake of the original Mad Max and The Road Warrior but at the same time is it's own original film. Not only that but there's the aspect of the characters- and despite the massive amounts of action, every major character is completely developed, and even the supporting cast is very memorable for different reasons. In actuality the story keeps the action from getting old and the two parts actually are almost the same thing. This movie is almost a month old at the time I'm writing this review and this is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This may not be the case for most people, but the use of action as visual storytelling really left an impression on me and I wish more action movies will follow in its footsteps. It really is impressive that 30 years after the last Mad Max movie and after 14 years of delay that George Miller brought back his signature series with a completely new vision. I look forward to the sequels that come. This is a really simple summary and it does not do the movie the justice it deserves. Mad Max Fury Road is a movie that cannot be summarized in words. It can only be experienced.",10,6,16,13 June 2015
