The New World," Biggest Disappointment of the Year
","OK, after seeing endless previews on this movie I expected it to be the next great historical drama (i.e. Last of the Mohicans, Gladiator, whatever). I don't need a movie to be full of action and even normally enjoy movies with now action. However, a movie should not be hyped up to the extent of New World without backing it up even the least. This movie dragged, dragged, and dragged, holding the viewer to wait for the climax of the movie. Perhaps the only reason that I didn't walk out was to wait and hope that something in the movie would be different. However, after over two hours of watching two people walk through the forest, I was left extremely disappointed. I'm not saying that this was the worst movie I saw in the last year. It wasn't. However, New World did fail to meet its expectations unlike any movie I have seen in a very long time.",1,16,26,25 May 2006
