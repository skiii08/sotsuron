Mission: Impossible III," Creaky and labored
","Spoiler alert It takes about 2 seconds after seeing the good guys and bad guys pair up for you to figure out who the real bad guy is who is setting Ethan Hunt up for failure. And while Owen Davian gets away, it would have been more interesting for John Musgrave to get away instead, and perhaps even to make him less 'revealed' as to add to the suspense for the next movie.What made the movie fail for me was to have Musgrave commit the cardinal rule of criminals in movies: they explain to the guy they want to kill what their motives are for evil; when the good guy gets away and then kills the bad guy, it all makes sense. Musgrave's reason for setting up Hunt? He (Musgrave) is against affirmative action, and as John Brassel is black, it's all a plot to discredit Brassel so the whiteys can get back in power. At least, that's about the most coherent thing I could make of it.If that 2 minute scene were either rewritten or dropped, it would have made the movie much more interesting. But just as MI2 had the ludicrous 'we want stock options!' for the bad guys, MI3 fails due to this completely pathetic reasoning for Musgrave. I mean, evil people don't get ahead in life because they're stupid. They get ahead because they're smart. And this is just not smart.",4,1,1,13 May 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Not bad
","I was prepared not to like this. Coen Brother movies are so uneven - sometimes quite good, sometimes stinkers.But this was good and funny. I laughed out loud about every 5 minutes at some inanity or foolish action.Still, some of it was extremely weak.**** SPOILER **** The movie starts in present day Ann Arbor - for no good reason. And nothing about the scene 'sets it' in Ann Arbor. It could be Anytown, USA. So what was the point of that? The protagonist's wife falls for his boss. The boss has an artificial arm/hand. To what purpose? Not even a sight gag. Just there. This wasn't funny - just weird, and not weird in the sense of 'moving the plot along weird' or 'makes the movie more interesting weird.' Just as if it were stuck in there for 'this should make people laugh weird.' Well, it didn't.The Iraqi journalist Mahmoud gives the protagonist and his mentor his truck. This is not explained why. He just does. And they end up leaving the car in the desert. This is not explained why.The goats in the desert are 'debleated.' This is not explained why, nor does it make sense in the plot, as the base is out in the middle of no where, unlike the first instance where the base was Ft. Bragg.Letting criminals go free in the desert is no kindness. Based upon the previous scenes, there is nothing for hundreds of miles. And yet the prisoners walk out into the desert to their certain deaths. This is not explained why.Giving soldiers on the FOB who have guns and who drive dangerous equipment LSD, in this movie, leads to no deaths or injuries. This is not explained why. I realize that this is a movie, but the soldiers who are stoned always manage to avoid the path of the various heavy equipment driving recklessly through the base and sometimes through buildings.Too many weird things like this. Makes it not funny because I was constantly going, 'but even in the reality of this movie, this doesn't make sense.' So, a '6' - good, but not much better than average.",6,0,2,24 November 2009
War of the Worlds," A great series of special effects
","This movie is great for special effects! Houses explode, bridges rupture, people are disintegrated right before your eyes (or, sometimes, above your heads so all you see are the gently drifting bras and underpants).Lots of flash boom bang action.Somewhere in there was a plot, theme, and characters - but who cares? It was fun, fun, fun!Tom Cruise emotes solely with his eyes, as usual, and plays the dysfunctional father of one or two kids (it was never clear whether the kids were his, or his wife's, or maybe rented for the day). Dakota Fanning is great as the spoiled rich kid who has everything but understands nothing. Eowyn (Miranda Otto) comes in at one point, pregnant by (we think) Faramir, only where is the gorgeous jewelry and costumes - and then one realizes: *this is a different movie*, only she's forgotten it. But she does live in the one neighborhood in Boston untouched by the aliens' destruction, and even as her son is able to walk through a battlefield unscathed, so she is able to live in a row house that is untouched.",5,0,0,10 July 2005
The Terminal," Sweet and bittersweet
","Contains Spoiler This is not a hit-it-out-of-the-ballpark film. It's just a very good film. Hanks plays a believable ferriner (!) stuck in hell - well, stuck in a New York airport - because his country has effectively disappeared & thus he cannot get his papers to enter the U.S. He survives by both his wit and his charm, along with plenty of skill at woodworking and finish work. He meets up with Catherine Zeta-Jones (who is gorgeous!) and helps her sort out her life, but he doesn't end up with her. Instead, he fulfills his vow to his father - to get one last signature. The end is bittersweet. He gets the signature, and returns home. Catherine is sadder, but wiser. Lots of the underclass learn what it means to be brave - really brave.A nice date night movie.",Null,0,1,30 June 2004
