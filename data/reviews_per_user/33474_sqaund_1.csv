Conquest 1453," nationalistic crap / non-historic fantasy
","This is one of the most horrible movies i ever saw. The Turkish conquest of constantinopel is depicted as a heroic deed of heroic men. In truth, the massive Turkish army of over 150,000 soldiers fought against a meager last minute established 8,000 byzantine/ venetian defense force. Which they only conquered thanks to enormous cannons made by hungarian engineers. What happened when the city was conquered was worse: raping murdering pillaging. Priests where murdered in the churches while holding services. The ottoman soldiers even started destroying the aya sofia, which mehmet II only could save just in time (he was admiring the byzantine art).This movie however is a complete false rewriting of history with the turks as superheroes; which i guess is nice to watch if your a turk with no interest in history and can put up with really bad acting.",1,23,42,9 February 2013
