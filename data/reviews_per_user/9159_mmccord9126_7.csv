Blade Runner 2049," On its own, a great movie
","Having been a Blade Runner devotee from its inception of the original (even during pre-production), I had great expectations for this sequel. Expectations that probably would be nearly impossible to meet. And so they were. That withstanding, the film deserves stand alone credit for proving to be an honest attempt at living up to the fictional world established in the original film. It more than adequately carried on the overall atmosphere and vitality of the original, but failed to truly capture its 'future noir', as suggested in Paul Sammon's book about the film's creation(1996).The cast and the production itself, on the other hand, combined to make it entertaining, in spite of the film's longer than necessary length. Some additional refinement would have been appropriate (ex: cut the junk yard scene with the toy horse.) Gosling's performance as 'K' was truly believable; what one would expect from one of Hollywood's better actors today. Ford, as Deckard, needs no comment as he will always be Deckard. Ana de Armos, as Joi, was captivating and added an interesting twist on 'K's' backstory. Sylvia Hoeks, as Luv was okay, but she's no Roy Batty by any stretch. Robin Wright, as Lt. Joshi was well done (big fan of her). And it was good to see Edward James Olmos as Gaff again,; even if the role was minimal. Casting Mackenzie Davis as Mariette was obviously done to remind fans of Daryl Hannah's great work in the original.Deciding to have Rachel give birth to Deckard's child worked for me, even though it's not the route I would have preferred be followed. However, Tyrell did say that the replicants were 'more human than humans.' It became the quest for the golden fleece that any hero's journey requires, so I can go along with it.SF author K.W. Jeter wrote three sequels to Phillip K. Dicks original, all under the title of 'Blade Runner'. Together, these three books carried on a much better series of events and circumstances that I believe would have made for a better possible franchise; something that may be on the horizon with the release of this film. Especially, considering the many open possibilities presented at the end of the film (i.e. Deckard meeting his daughter; the possible Nexus8 revolt; Wallace's next move, 'K's' fate, etc.) In conclusion, I really did like the film and would easily recommend it to anyone who enjoys legitimate science fiction.",7,2,6,8 October 2017
Gravity," Been Waiting a Long Time For This One
","It only took 45 years for someone to top Kubrick's 2001. And now it finally happened. Not only was it technically near perfect, but Gravity had a solid story and great acting from Bullock and Clooney to boot. I'm trying to picture another actress in Bullock's role, but I can't imagine anyone who could have done a better, more believable job of it. I've been a fan of SF films (although, this isn't really SF) for about 60 years now and started reading in the SF genre when I was about 10 years old. My two favorite films to date, until now, are 2001 and Bladerunner. Of late, the only one that even came close to them was Avatar (3rd best). You may be able to find some technical glitches in this film if you look real, real hard, but I bet they'll only be trivial. All I can say is: move over 2001 and Bladerunner; you just got some brand, new competition for my vote.Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron - Nice piece of film work, indeed.",10,6,12,4 October 2013
Just Go with It," Forget It
","This terrible remake of I.A.L. Diamond's work on Cactus Flower back in 1969, itself based on an excellent stage play, was difficult to sit through: Too long, too unfunny, and to formulaic. Relying on sight gags and stale jokes cannot save a bad film, much less a screenplay that probably required very little effort on the part of the writers. Of late, much of what's coming out of Hollywood reeks of paranoia. When one is afraid to take a risk, in the genre of romantic comedies, remake something that was successful years ago. This travesty is indicative such a mentality. Also, when will Jennifer A. wake up and stop getting herself involved in films that will do little for her career? Save your money and rent Cactus Flower. Trust me, you'll be happy you did.",1,70,141,14 February 2011
Interstellar," A Bit of a Disappointment
","When I first heard of the making of this film, I had reservations about it. Then, I learned that a well-known scientist(Kip Thorne) was attached to it as a technical consultant and my interest began to increase. Getting it right, scientifically, seldom works with the film industry, although there have been limited occasions where it has. Avatar, Kubrick's classic 2001 back in 1968, and one even further back, Forbidden Planet (1956) show that it can be done.With this in mind, I thought this might be one of those rare ones that could live up to my expectations. I mean, after all, Christopher Nolan and Thorne. How could it fail. I've always believed that, in order to make a quality science fiction film, you have to have a writer that knows what the genre is all about. In this case, there is not only the potential for quality writing from Nolan but also scientific expertise from one of the top scientist in the field - what could go wrong...go wrong.... Well, in spite of all that, it did just that.Yes, it was a visual treat that applied all the wonderful effects developed over the years. And it did that very well. But that's not enough anymore; at least not for me.What I experienced instead was story that was based on a premise that was faulty almost from the start with scientific shortcomings and implausible circumstances. And that's where the disappointment comes in for me. I can understand Nolan's possible lack of detailed knowledge of wormholes, time dilation, gravity effects, and the like, but how could a respected scientist like Thorne allow it? Unless of course he had little control over the film's production. Alas, that is probably the case.I'm not going into any detail about the the actual story because that is already well documented in other reviews. I end with a final summary and opinion: If you know little about that actual scientific aspects of the various theories touched upon in this film, you'll probably find it entertaining. If, on the other hand, you have sufficient knowledge of what we humans actually know of such things; you too, may be a bit disappointed.",4,17,33,7 November 2014
Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher ?? Maybe. Bad Film? Absolutely
","I know others will disagree with me, but this has got to be in the running for the pick for the Razzies this year. What a pathetic piece of crap. The storyline was boring and the jokes either over-the-top, or, worst, not even close to funny. It never fails to amaze me when really bad ideas not only get to be screenplays, but they actually wind up getting produced. And...Timberlake's character...what was he thinking when he took this role??? Yeah, Diaz is still a hot body and all, but even that couldn't save something so downright dumb. I won't bother with any spoilers; it's not worth the effort. Save your money. This one will simply insult your intelligence. I would give it a minus one if I could.",1,249,427,30 June 2011
Elysium," Liked the CGI and sets, but didn't like the story
","What seems to be a trend in big budget SF films occurred, once again, in Elysium. I'm continually impressed with what is being created (visual effects wise)today, but remain disappointed when it comes to the associated screenplays/plot lines. At the end of this film, I had the same, perpetual feeling that no one out there making SF films gets the message: without a good story, you don't have a really good film. Elysium hearkens me back to Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott. I would have thought he, at least, would appreciate the need for a good story to match the visuals. Especially after being the brains behind Bladerunner. But, oh no - same thing. I suspect that so much talent and expense is spent on the visuals that insufficient amounts of funding and time are left for the associated story.I just wish that, when someone comes up with future plans for making a legitimate SF film (sans comic book scenarios), they contract a real science fiction author to write the screenplay. There are any number of SF writers out there that can, I believe, turn out much better scripts than currently making their way to the big screen.Bottom line: the world building in Elysium was excellent. Probably some of the best since Avatar. I wish there had been some of this when Bladerunner was produced. As an avid, and long time fan of true science fiction, I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film. As for the story, it could have been a lot, lot better.",5,530,764,10 August 2013
Prometheus," Great Visuals - Disappointing storyline
","I'm only giving this film a 4 out of 10 because, and only because, of the great sets and visuals. It saddens my heart to see such terrific technology wasted on a mediocre, at best, storyline. I would think that Ridley Scott would know better than to let a couple of Hollywood hack writers anywhere near one of his films. BladeRunner is my all time favorite science fiction film. Between Scott's direction and Harrison Ford's portrayal of Deckard, no truer depiction of a possible future has ever been done by anyone else; except, of course, in Avatar. This clunker, on the other hand, is a tribute to what can go wrong when a director's common sense falls prey to the easiest way to get it done. To me, this was just a 1950's bad 'B' movie dressed up in modern techniques. Anyone who knows anything about SF knows that its true fans are completely unforgiving when it comes to short changing your story. It's the stories that make us love the genre.",4,12,25,13 June 2012
