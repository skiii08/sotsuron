Blade Runner 2049," Stunning visuals, but
","Visually this movie is absolutely stunning. The sound design that went along with it was terrific as well. It really sucks you into this futuristic world. The movie is just really well made.Story-wise it was quite good as well.The pacing however is too slow, and the movie feels like it goes on a bit too long.Bottom line: I really enjoyed this movie but felt it was a bit too slow. 7/10",7,8,19,8 October 2017
Aquaman," Superhero movie
","Aquaman is ok.
Fairly formulaic, sprinkled with some clichÃ©s.
Some cool CGI and visuals.
Some cringy lines and acting, although overall decent acting.
Fairly average superhero movie of the 2010s. Better than Justice League at least, which was a relief.
I'd say early teenagers would enjoy this film the most of any demographic.",5,0,1,30 December 2018
