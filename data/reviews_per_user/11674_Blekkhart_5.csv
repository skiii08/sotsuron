The Expendables 2," I had a goooood time x 10 ! No spoilers
","What else matters really...than being entertained and having a good time when watching a movie ? OK, sometimes it's good I guess to watch movies with a meaning or with a political statement or whatever...artsy movies, movies that will make you cry and long for your mummy. Movies with complex multi-layered plots. Well...Expendables 2 is not that kind of movie. Not even close. Not even on the same planet actually. Thank god ! This movie does not have a meaning or a political statement. It's not artsy. It doesn't even have a story. Not at all. Nada. Zip. Nothing (OK, our heroes go after a very bad villain called Mr. Villain, but that's it). Yet, it's a great movie !!Because what this movie does have is a) every major action star from the last 40 years (minus Seagal, Snipes, Dwayne Johnson and some others, but they will probably all pop up in Expendables 3). b) a lot of action....the opening sequence is 20 minutes of non-stop pure action heaven. c) a lot of cheesy one-liners...but guess what, they are actually funny ! I laughed and cheered all the way through this movie...and the laughs were not unintentional. d) Ohhh...and did I also mention that this movie has HEART. Lots of it ! Yes, this movie will put it's arm around you and say 'hey buddy, you OK ? don't worry, life sucks sometimes, but let's just forget about all our troubles and enjoy for a while. Cheers mate...clink' Our heroes are tough yes...they show no mercy to their enemies of course. But still deep down...they are nice guys with warm hearts. And it shows in this movie. We actually do get to care about them a little.Anyway...bottom line. This is a feel good action movie. If you liked the first, you will love this one. And if you didn't like the first...you will love this one. It's bigger, better, warmer, nicer, funnier etc. And it's also a little adventurous...they even get stuck inside a cave ! Enough talking...go see it already !",10,1,6,22 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The rise of Skywalker is ok in my humble opinion
","Im just back from the theatre. I feel ok with this movie. Im old enough to have seen the original trilogy back in the 80's as a kid. I love it and watch it regularly. I have also grown to love the prequels over the years. But Im not a fanboy who knows every detail about the SW universe. I just love the overall experience and escapism that it offers. I was ok with The force awakens. I was not fully satisfied, but the introduction of Luke at the end gave me hopes for The last jedi. But unfortunatly that movie left me feeling disappointed, like so many others (I never thought I would ever feel bored and disappointed watching a Star Wars movie). There are so many things I dislike about it.And so I went into The rise of Skywalker with lowered expectations. Especially after having heard alot of negative things and rumours about it. But guess what...I actually enjoyed it for what it is. Technically the movie is great. It looks fantastic. There are alot of things going on in the movie...it might be difficult to keep up with everything during the first viewing, but there is certainly plenty to like. I decided to just go along with it as a 2 1/2 hours popcorn epic. I was mostly not bored. I especially liked the scenes involving the main antagonist. There are some really cool scenes. There is plenty of good action. The last 30 - 40 minutes are spectacular. The acting is ok for the most part. There is much less of the things that ruined The last jedi for me. I prefer JJ's style of directing to RJ's. I like the overall dark tone of the movie. The musical score is great. And Im ok with the story...Im ok with how the saga concludes. I think they were able to tie the loose ends together in a way that I can live with. I felt the saga came full circle in the end. Im sure there are many fans of the original trilogy and the prequels who will never find love for the disney trilogy. I understand that. But personally I have decided to accept it for what it is and focus on the positives and not the negatives. The rise of Skywalker is ok in my humble opinion.",7,0,2,21 December 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," Can't decide whether to be offended or impressed
","I review this movie without having seen the original. Maybe that's just as good, since the review will then be based on the merits of this movie alone and not on how it holds to the original. What is this movie all about ? To me it's about shock value, horror, torture, freaks, sadism, survival, humiliation, revenge and a lot of gore. Some people will probably find the gore and horror in this movie hilarious and look at it with humor, while other people will be offended. Personally I'm leaning more towards the latter. I love horror movies, but I was never a fan of movies like Hostel and Saw, where horrific killings and torture seems to be used solely for shock value - as cheap entertainment. This movie will probably appeal to the audience of those movies. But in my view it is a superior movie. It's not Deliverance, which explored the theme of survival against sadism on a different and more serious level (I would label that movie more of a drama than a horror movie). Hills is definitely a horror movie and pure entertainment. But as such it's actually very well made ! The directing, acting, locations, effects, musical score...it is all quality stuff and makes this movie something more than just a cheap bucket of blood and fake limbs being poured all over the audience. I find this movie quite artistic and atmospheric at times. The cinematography is nice. It's not a cheap attempt on cashing in on gore hungry viewers..it's quite a classy attempt on cashing in on gore hungry viewers:) And I guess it must be a worthy remake of the original. What it all comes down to is - do you like these kind of movies or not. If you do, I guess I can recommend this movie. But it's definitely not for the faint of heart. Personally, I was balancing on the edge all through the movie, not being able to decide if I should be impressed by the quality of the filmmaking, or if I should be offended on what was portrayed on the screen. What really made this movie hard for me to watch was the scene involving rape and murder of innocent women, and the fact that there was a baby involved. But in terms of filmmaking it's definitely a good movie. So I guess I will give it a 6. I'm sure people who are not offended, will easily be able to give it a higher rating.",6,1,1,1 November 2010
30 Days of Night," Beautiful cinematography filled with sadistic visions
","I watched this movie with my girlfriend. She is a big fan of Twilight and has romantic ideas about vampires. By the end she was so disgusted she had to walk away. This tells you what you need to know about 30 days of night. It's portrayal of vampires is far from the teenage romantic vision offered in Twilight. This movie is dark, cold, sadistic and bloody. There is nothing romantic about ripping someones neck apart and letting them bleed to death. Anyone who wants to be a vampire based on having seen Twilight, should watch this movie first to make sure they really want what they wish for (be careful what you wish for because it might come true). All in all I think this movie is an above average vampire movie. It is beautiful and atmospheric with interesting and believable characters, and not so ridiculous, posed, stylized and shallow like many other horror movies nowadays. It actually has some substance underneath all the gloss. I just wish the ending had been more intelligent, surprising and thought provoking. I like those movies with a twist in the end that makes your gut churn, like The Mist. If this movie had stepped up that extra notch towards the end, it would have been truly great.",7,0,2,11 October 2010
12 Strong," Technically brilliant action adventure movie
","I am old enough to have a vivid memory of the historic events that are described in this movie. I remember 9/11. I remember following the news every day after. That makes this movie interesting from a historic perspective. It kind of takes me behind the headlines I remember so well from back then. However, I think this movie is best viewed as an action adventure movie, rather than a documentary style war movie. If you expect the latter...then maybe you will be disappointed. If you expext the former, this movie will take you on a hell of a ride. The movie offers intense action sequences. But what really makes this movie stand out for me is the cinematography and the brooding score. This movie looks amazing. Its interesting, because I had to look up who did the cinematography. And it turns out its the same guy who also did the cinematography for The Dark Tower, a movie I reviewed last week and where I also pointed out the stunning cinematography. This guy is amazing. Same goes for the director and music composer. What a talented group of people who created this movie. I think the bad reviews must be from people having the wrong expectations. Dont expect a war documentary. This is not Restrepo. Expect a technically brilliant action adventure war movie that will take you on a dark, intense, brooding and breathtaking ride to hell and back",8,0,1,1 December 2018
